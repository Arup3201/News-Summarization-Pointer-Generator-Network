Former Labor leader Mark Latham has faced a torrent of criticism after he penned a bizarre attack on mothers who take anti-depressants, labelling it the 'easy way out'.

In his regular Australian Financial Review column on Thursday, Latham took aim at a Sydney writer who confessed to using 'caffeine and anti-depressants' to help raise her two young children.  

'Why do people like this have children in the first place?' he wrote, referring to medical student Lisa Pryor. 

'How will children feel when they grow up and learn that they pushed their mother onto anti-depressants?'

Latham was widely pilloried for his remarks, in which he said mums who take anti-depressants were 'taking the easy way out'

Latham, who came within a polite handshake of becoming prime minister, was widely pilloried for his statement, which focused upon why 'left feminists demonise children'.

Describing inner-city feminists, Latham said: 'More often than not, they don’t like children and don’t want to be with them.'

He said taking pills was a 'cowardly' alternative to 'facing up to the responsibilities of adulthood' and described his children as his own 'anti-depressants'. 

Writer Clementine Ford's retort to Latham was widely shared

Author Tara Moss questioned whether Latham should be 'given a platform for attacking working mums'

'Oh boy... The man must have a death wish': Industrial relations expert Grace Collier reacted to Latham's column

Columnist Mia Freedman said Latham's column was an 'extraordinarily irresponsible and repugnant attack on women, on mothers and on anyone who seeks help for mental illness'. 

'Mark Latham’s column is a piece of bile that should never have been published,' she wrote on women's website Mamamia. 

'It shamefully and cruelly annihilated Lisa Pryor, chastising her as a bad mother, a bad feminist and a bad human being.'

Feminist group Destroy the Joint said Latham's was making 'sweeping generalisations' and described him as a 'loser'.

At the 2010 Federal election, Latham confronted the nation's political leaders as a reporter for 60 Minutes

The Daily Telegraph's Alicia Wood pointed out how Latham's considerable parliamentary pension made his life easier.

'Unlike Mark Latham, this inner-city feminist does not have the benefit of earning $70,000 a year for doing absolutely nothing,' Wood wrote. 

Writer Clementine Ford tweeted: 'Every so often, Mark Latham comes along and reminds you why we were so lucky not to have him as Prime Minister.'  

The controversial leader quit politics in 2005 after his party was cleaned up by Prime Minister John Howard at the previous year's federal election. 

That year, he released an inflammatory account of his time in politics, the Latham Diaries. 

He has since become a full-time carer for his children, has written several tomes about the future of the Labor party and held a brief role as a reporter for 60 Minutes during the 2010 federal election.

In response to Latham's attack, Pryor pointed out on Twitter that she spends five days a week working at a western Sydney children's hospital.
