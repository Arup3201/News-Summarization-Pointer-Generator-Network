A top policeman who was accused of whistle blowing after he had his home and office bugged by colleagues has told how he's been left him 'humiliated' by an investigation into the scandal.

NSW Deputy Police Commissioner Nick Kaldas told a parliamentary inquiry he has been punished for speaking out, including being passed over for promotion, while attacking the way the NSW Ombudsman has handled a two-year investigation into the bugging scandal that reaches to the highest levels of the NSW Police Force.

Mr Kaldas, who has hunted murderers, worked in warzones and faced death threats from terrorists, has revealed there is no one he fears more than NSW Ombudsman Bruce Barbour.

The parliamentary inquiry is the final stage of Operation Prospect, an investigation which begun two years ago by the NSW Ombudsman, using royal commission-style powers to investigate two controversial operations, Mascot and Florida, mounted by the police Special Crime and Internal Affairs unit in 2000.

Man of integrity: One of the country's most distinguished police officers, NSW deputy commissioner Nick Kaldas (pictured) has worked in Iraq, locked up murderers and trained with the FBI, but his stellar career has been dogged by an illegal bugging operation commandeered in 2000 by his rival for the top job

During Operations Mascot and Florida, Mr Kaldas was among more than 100 officers named on phone tap warrants allegedly obtained by officers using false or misleading evidence to judges.

He became the target of a surveillance operation overseen by the current Police Commissioner, Andrew Scipione and run by his now fellow deputy, Catherine Burn.

'I received many threats from Hezbollah and other proxy groups,' Mr Kaldas told the Upper House inquiry in Sydney on Friday, referring to his work advising coalition police forces in Iraq and leading a United Nations investigation into the 2005 assassination of Lebanese prime minister Rafic Hariri.

'I fear no man and I have operated in trusted circles with the top secret level of clearance from our national government and our allies.

'Yet I have never been denigrated, humiliated and had my every action and thought so unreasonably maligned as I experienced during Operation Prospect.'

The rival: Deputy police commissioner Kath Burn has denied she illegally bugged police or enacted listening device warrants against fellow deputy commissioner Nick Kaldas as 'part of a personal vendetta'. Both senior officers are seen as candidates for the next NSW police commissioner

Man the middle: Current NSW police commissioner Andrew Scipione was the boss of the internal affairs unit that bugged the phones of 114 police and others in what is now being investigated as an illegal phone tapping scandal that threatens to tarnish Scipione's administration and end his deputy Kath Burn's career

Mr Kaldas told the inquiry he was targeted by officers in SCIA with whom he was in conflict, stemming, among other things, from complaints he made about them plagiarising a report he wrote on covert policing.

The early 2000 Mascot investigation found nothing but harmed his life, his family and his career, he said.

His mobile phone and his office as head of the homicide squad were bugged, as was the home of his ex-wife and children, and he was passed over for promotions.

Current NSW Police Commissioner Andrew Scipione was head of SCIA at the time Operation Mascot and Operation Florida were conducted, and current Deputy Commissioner Catherine Burn was the SCIA officer in charge of the operations.

Ms Burn, who has denied any wrongdoing in a statement, also appeared before the state parliamentary inquiry on Friday afternoon.

Mr Kaldas said Operation Prospect had sided with the officers being complained about and targeted him and other victims.

From child immigrant to 2IC: Nick Kaldas came from Egypt to Australia aged twelve, named 'Naguib' and was fluent in English, French and Arabic. He has risen through the ranks of the NSW Police Force as a hostage negotiator, homicide squad chief, counter terrorism expert, special adviser to Iraq and now a contender for  next commissioner

Softly spoken: Well-liked and a skilful and respected operator, deputy police commissioner Nick Kaldas (pictured) has a softly spoken manner which belies his incisive approach to tackling crime. After training police in Iraq, Kaldas returned to warn that Australia was 'not in isolation' and could be targeted by terrorists

After making complaints about the bugging, he was called down for a 'friendly' hearing with the Ombudsman last September but instead faced a day-long attack on his credibility.

'It felt to me this was a well-planned attack to silence me as one of the main complainants,' he said.

'The Ombudsman has now summoned me again to appear before him and I hold fears of his intentions towards me.'

He told the inquiry: 'Yet again my privacy has been utterly invaded with operation prospect where my diaries, my notebooks, my emails my phone records have all been seised by the Ombudsman and yet again the justification for this invasion of privacy is completely out of proportion to what is alleged.'

Veteran journalist Neil Mercer, who has written extensively about operations Mascot and Florida, appeared before the inquiry and testified that SCIA officers had condoned a criminal informant giving perjured evidence in court.

Uncertainty: Commissioner Andrew Scipione (above) may be affected by the inquiry into the secret bugging operation he oversaw

Mr Mercer also revealed that he had been called before the ombudsman in 2014 and was asked - with the agreement of his source - to reveal where he obtained documents relating to Operation Mascot.

Mr Kaldas, an Arabic speaking counter terrorism expert who is an FBI trained hostage negotiator, has worked the netherworld of the undercover cop and been on the ground in Iraq training a police force to operate after the downfall of Saddam Hussein.

He has an outwardly gentle manner which belies his hard headed approach to tackling crime.

As one of the most experienced police officers in Australia he found himself a victim at the centre of the bugging scandal which threatens to engulf the hierarchy of the nation's oldest and largest police force.

Kaldas, 57, is touted as a leading candidate to take over the top job as NSW police commissioner.

He appeared at the parliamentary inquiry to give evidence of 'massive wrongdoing and habitual illegal acts' committed during the bugging operation by senior officers.

He has equal ranking with deputy commissioner Catherine Burn, the officer who is accused of bugging 114 people, including police officers, civilians and a journalist.

Ms Burn was the senior officer who briefed NSW politicians in the wake of the December siege on the Lindt cafe.

Mr Kaldas is expected to say illegal acts committed during an internal police affairs investigation called Operation Mascot were 'sanctioned and covered up' by the Police Integrity Commission and NSW Crime Commission.

He is the most high profile police officer placed under covert surveillance by the operation, which aimed to bug allegedly corrupt police in the early 2000s.

Voice of the siege: Kath Burn was the senior police officer who faced the media after briefing NSW politicians about the police operation in the Sydney siege. It has since been revealed that siege victim Katrina Dawson died when a fragment of a police bullet hit one of her arteries

His unquestioned integrity and wealth of experience fighting crime - he has been a commander of the NSW Gangs Squad and an assistant commissioner for counter terrorism, as well as being deployed by the Federal government to Iraq as a special police adviser - makes Mr Kaldas's evidence most damning.

Catherine Burn put Operation Mascot into play the day before the opening of the Sydney Olympics, on September 14, 2000, when she allegedly swore a warrant for the Special Crimes and Internal Affairs unit (SCIA) before Sydney judge Virginia Bell.

Almost half of the officers' names on the warrant were supposed to have attended a farewell function for a retiring police sergeant at a club on Sydney's north shore.

The warrant was based on flawed information. Most of the officers had not attended the function which had been held three months earlier.

When Fairfax news revealed the bugging operation in 2002, Ms Burn was ordered to report to the NSW police minister.

Then police commissioner Peter Ryan dismissed the issue on national television, saying if he has been a guest at the police farewell, he too would have been bugged.

The allegedly illegal bugging operation continued to surface in reports since, becoming part of an investigation called Strike Force Emblems and the crux of the NSW Upper House inquiry which opened on Thursday.

On the ground: Nick Kaldas, pictured with then police minister John Watkins in 2006, warned on his return from Iraq that year that 'Australia is very much part of the international community and if something happens in Palestine or Iraq, we have to accept that it has an impact over here'

In the lead up to the inquiry, Ms Burn has denied falsifying evidence in the warrant to Judge Bell to secretly bug police, or to 'use illegal warrants to secretly record conversations of my rivals in the police force'.

She has specifically denied she directed use of illegal warrants to bug Mr Kaldas 'as part of a personal vendetta' when there was no suspicion of his wrongdoing.

Kaldas, 57, is the son of Egyptian Christian parents who emigrated to Australia when he was 12 years old. He landed in western Sydney with the first name of Naguib, but he spoke fluent English and French.

Kaldas also spoke Arabic at home and remained fluent in the language as he grew up, graduating from high school and later the NSW Police Academy, in 1981.

He rose quickly through the ranks. Kaldas worked as an undercover detective and in the Homicide Squad investigating high profile murder cases.

He completed a masters degree in public policy and administration at also the hostage negotiators course in 1996 at FBI headquarters in Quantico, Virginia. In 2004, was appointed chief of the NSW Crime Command's gangs squad.

In the same year, he was seconded for the first time to Iraq, as Senior Police Adviser, National Operations, and later as Deputy Chief Police Adviser to the Coalition Provisional Authority, and spent eight months training Iraqi police.

On his return in 2006, when Kaldas was promoted to NSW Police assistant commissioner in charge of counter terrorism and public order management, he said a terrorist attack in Australia was likely.

'Australia is very much part of the international community and if something happens in Palestine or Iraq, we have to accept that it has an impact over here,' he said at the time.

In 2009, Kaldas was seconded to the Hague for the Special Tribunal for Lebanon investigating the assassination of Rafic Hariri, the Lebanese prime minister who was blown up in a Beirut motorcade in 2005.

Back in Australia, Kaldas was made one of NSW's two deputy police commissioners and has carried on with his distinguished career, all the while with an inquiry into the bugging operation looming closer.
