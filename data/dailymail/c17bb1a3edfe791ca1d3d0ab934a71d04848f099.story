Spanish newspaper 'SPORT' described Barcelona as 'disappointing leaders' of La Liga after their loss to Real Madrid on Saturday evening. 

Goals from Cristiano Ronaldo, Pepe and Karim Benzema secured a 3-1 win for Los Blancos, and the media in Spain did not hold back in their criticism of Luis Enrique's Barcelona.

SPORT went on to explain that despite a positive start, and an opening goal from Neymar, Madrid took advantage of Barcelona's mistakes to go on and win. 

'A disappointing leader', read SPORT's headline on Sunday morning

MARCA and AS also laid into Barcelona, after they were outclassed by Real Madrid on Saturday afternoon

MARCA lauded Madrid as a 'wonder team' that overcame their opponents 'in every department'. They explained that Carlo Ancelotti's side, who are now just one point behind their rivals, were better at everything, and too much for Barcelona to handle.

Benzema was described as 'stunning', while Isco, Luka Modric, Marcelo, Pepe, Sergio Ramos, Iker Casillas and Toni Kroos were all 'superb'. 

The Bernabau crowd were also said to be 'delighted', as Barcelona's unbeaten run in La Liga this season was brought to an end.

'Like this, like this, like this, Madrid wins', read the headline of AS on Sunday morning. They included the quotes of both managers, with Barcelona boss Enrique explaining: 'Madrid were at a very high level and deserved to win.'

Carlo Ancelotti said, 'I have a very serious team that knows how to make sacrifices.'

Mundo Deportivo described Barcelona as 'average', and explained that they were overcome in the second half

The Italian papers focused on Roma's missed opportunity to go top of the league

Mundo Deportivo led with the headline, 'An average Barca', while explaining that despite a competitive first half, Enrique's side were overcome after the break.

Neymar's goal, they write, equalled the fastest goal ever in a Clasico in Madrid, while Luis Suarez produced a promising debut in the capital.

Over in Italy, Roma missed out on a chance to go top of Serie A when they could only manage a 0-0 draw against Samporia.

Corriere Dello Sport run with the headline, 'Roma, a bitter setback', describing that for the first time this season Rudi Garcia's side failed to score. 

Juventus now have a golden opportunity to break away at the top, when they face Palermo at home.

Tuttosport tell Juventus 'wake up!' in the build-up to a match that could see them go three points clear for the first time this season.

They include quotes from the Juventus manager Massimiliano Allegri, who says, 'We need more as a team, but also as individuals.

'Conte? Extraordinary, but now he is part of history and not the present.'
