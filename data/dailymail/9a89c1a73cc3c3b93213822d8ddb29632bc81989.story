Looking forlorn and cramped in a tiny cage strewn with empty beer bottles and other rubbish, it is no life for an animal more used to roaming the forests.

Yet details have emerged about a shocking catalogue of abuse inflicted on two bears in Russia that has culminated with them being left alcoholics and in need of medical treatment.

Prosecutors have revealed that for the past two decades a Sochi restaurant owner has allowed his guests to ply the animals with drink as part of some macabre spectacle.

Barely able to stand: Empty beer bottles are strewn across the cramped cage the creatures were kept in. Both had become alcoholics after 20 years of abuse

Grizzly: One bear looks worse for wear after being fed beer and junk food by diners at a Russian restaurant 

Court officials in Sochi, home to the 2014 Winter Olympic Games, have seized the bears, following protests from the local community.

But Sergey Zenkov, the head of the Krasnodar regional agency for the protection of wildlife, said there could be problems in rehoming the animals as a result of their health.

One of them has also gone blind because of motorists parking outside the prison-like cage with their dazzling headlights on, in a bid to deliberately cause the bears distress. 

Drunken stupor: He might look happy but years of cruelty have taken their toll on two caged bears in Russia. Both needed medical treatment after being plied with alcohol for two decades

Caged: A new home is being sought for the disheveled animals, who have spent the last 20 years, as a prized animal attraction. Their freedom was secured after protests from locals

He said: 'The animals definitely should not be held in such conditions. But there are many legal obstacles if someone wants to take them away, even with a court decision.

'We will consult with lawyers when we get the court decision.'

It is thought the bears first appeared at the Patskha-Guria restaurant about 20 years ago when they were cubs.

To begin with the owner Dzheniks Uzaroshvili charged people to have their picture taken with his new pets. But as they grew older, and bigger, they were placed in a small pen.

Visitors continued to come to his restaurant to see his animal attraction and he started allowing people to give them beer and junk food for entertainment.

Attraction: Visitors flock to see the two bears at a restaurant in Russia. The animals were taken into care after suffering severe health problems brought on by a diet of junk food and beer

Prisoner:  One bear looks desperately sad to be kept as an 'animal amusement' in a small cage, next to a restaurant. It was rescued with its cell-mate after being fed with junk food and beer for two decades

Dirty den: The bears were rescued from terrible conditions following complaints from locals. After a court hearing in Sochi, it transpired the owner already had charges for not giving suitable provision to his animals

Sleeping it off: The bears take a nap in squalid conditions in their home  in Russia

Mr Uzaroshvili insisted the bears were being kept in normal conditions, telling journalists: 'Beer is good for them because they live in such a climate.'

However, a number of local people complained about the treatment and protests were held in front of the premises.

'Nobody has ever done a normal veterinary examination of these bears,' said one nearby resident, called Natalia. 'They do not get proper food, they do not have clean water, and there is only a stinking liquid, consisting of a small amount of water and animals' own urine.

'There are also people who make fun of the poor animals. Visitors of the restaurant regularly give the bears alcoholic beverages to drink and feed them with chips, cakes and other unsuitable food.'

As Khostinskyi court in Sochi ruled that the bears should be taken from the restaurant, it emerged that the owner already had charges for not giving suitable provision to his animals.

The Ministry of Natural Resources in the Krasnodar region must now find new accommodation for the bears.

Bears are held in high esteem across Russia, with the animal even named as the official mascot of the 2014 Winter Olympics
