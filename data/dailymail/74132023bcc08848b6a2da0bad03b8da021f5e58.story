Police say a man shot dead his girlfriend and killed two of her teenage daughters before turning the gun on himself in a suspected murder-suicide case that rocked a small Texas town this weekend. 

Crowley Police Chief Luis Soler said Tuesday that investigators are still working to determine what led 36-year-old Samuel Morales to target the three at the home they shared south of Fort Worth.

Soler says 34-year-old Xiomara Leon was shot multiple times Sunday, as was her daughter, 18-year-old Linda Gonzalez. Thirteen-year-old Yasmine Zavala was strangled to death.

Lone survivor: The only person to escape the carnage unharmed was Leon's 9-year-old son (center), who was the one who called for help after seeing the bodies of his mother and sisters (pictured) 

The bodies were found by officers responding to a report of a suicide attempt at the home.

Soler says another of Leon's children, a 9-year-old boy, witnessed part of the attack and called a relative, who then called 911. The boy was not physically harmed. 

Police are not sure at this time why the child was spared by the gunman. They say he did not see much of the attack but witnessed the gruesome aftermath. 

'The brave 9-year-old boy is doing the best as he can under these circumstances,' Crowley Police Chief Luis Soler told reporters Tuesday. 'He’ll be all right. … We’ll take care of him.'

Investigators said Morales and Leon had been in a four-year relationship and lived together with the woman's children in the 200 block of Kennedy Drive.

The 36-year-old was not the biological father of his girlfriend's kids. 

Police also said that Morales had a concealed carry handgun permit and no criminal history.

The station WFAA reported that Yasmine Zavala was a student in Crowley ISD; Linda Gonzalez graduated from Crowley High School last year and was working as a teacher's aide at her alma mater.

Family friend Laura Gallardo recalled to MyFox DFW how tight-knit the family was, and how Yasmine would always wait for her big sister to return home from school.

Police Chief Soler told reporters Sunday night that everything indicates it was 'an isolated incident contained in this residence.'

The 9-year-old boy who was uninjured has been placed in protective custody and was interviewed by Crowley police on Sunday evening. 

Police said that family members have encouraged him to talk and to tell officers exactly what happened inside the house. 

'The deaths will have 'a huge impact in this tight-knit community,' the chief said.

Soler said detectives have spoken to the victims' relatives, who said that Leon and Morales had recently attended a family get-together and seemed 'fine,' reported Star-Telegram. 

Robert Arndt, a co-worker and friend of Leon’s, described her boyfriend as a 'fun' guy who acted as a father to her children, especially 9-year-old Nino who was like a son to him.

Leon worked at an AT&T store where she was known to her co-workers as 'Mama Xio' because she was nurturing and caring.

Amdt has launched a GoFundMe account to help raise money for his friend's sole surviving child.

A makeshift memorial made up of letters and flowers has been growing outside the family's home since Sunday.

A candlelight vigil honoring the slaughtered family was held Tuesday night at Bicentennial Park. 

Crowley, a city of about 13,000, according to its website, is about 15 miles south of Fort Worth. 

Crowley Police Chief Luis Soler said in a news conference Sunday night that a 9-year-old who was inside the home called a relative and told her that a man there was injured after attempting to kill himself
