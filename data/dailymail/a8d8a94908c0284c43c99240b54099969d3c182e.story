Many horseriders have taken to wearing bright hi-viz vests with the words 'Police' or 'Please' on the back

With the deaths of four horse riders and more than 100 casualties on the roads in a year, it’s easy to understand why many have taken to wearing high-visibility bibs.

But the bright clothing gained them unwanted attention when police warned they could be prosecuted – for impersonating an officer. 

The Association of Chief Police Officers has written to the British Horse Society criticising the safety gear.

The problem appears to be that riders often wear fluorescent jackets with the words POLITE or PLEASE on a black panel, to encourage motorists to give them space.

Some sport the reflective blue-and-silver chequered border used on police uniforms. 

Police responded after motorists complained they were mistaking hobby riders, of which there are about 3million in Britain, for mounted police officers. 

Assistant chief constable Ron Hanson, the association’s head of mounted policing, wrote: ‘Anyone possessing these products is at risk of breaking the law, namely section 90 of the Police Act 1996.’ 

In the letter, which has been posted on the BHS website, he said: ‘Over recent months a number of examples of high visibility equine apparel have been brought to my attention. 

‘These articles have caused concern to the police on the grounds individuals wearing them are likely to be mistaken for a police officer.’

Jackets in yellow, the colour used by police, those printed with a word resembling POLICE and any using blue-and-silver banding ran the risk of flouting the law, he said.

He added: ‘It is apparent that this issue has been subject to considerable debate through equine forums and I wish therefore to clarify the position from the police’s perspective for your readers so that they appreciate the risks associated with wearing such products.’

Mr Hanson has also issued guidance to  manufacturers and police. Nicky Fletcher, director of Equisafety, launched a range of bibs with the word POLITE in 2010. 

She advised riders to wear them, saying: ‘The law regarding this is so ambiguous as to be confusing, otherwise the new ACPO lead for the mounted police would not have had to interpret the law and issue “new” guidelines.’

She claimed the advice was ‘irresponsible and could certainly cause riders to remove hi- visibility clothing if approached by an officer’.

But Fiona Kennedy of V-Bandz said it had withdrawn clothing with the word PLEASE. 

The Royal Society for the Prevention of  Accidents recorded four road deaths of horse riders in 2011 and 133 accidents with casualties which were investigated by police. 

The BHS says there are 3,000 accidents involving horses on roads every year.
