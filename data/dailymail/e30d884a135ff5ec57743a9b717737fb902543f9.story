These are just some of the historic Radio Times Christmas front covers from the last 90 years.

From a family round the fire, to a red-breasted robin perched on a holly tree - the Christmas editions of the iconic TV listings magazine have featured numerous festive scenes throughout the years.

The first set of covers from 1923 is a colour 
illustration of a family sitting together around the radio together.

In the beginning: The very first Christmas cover, left, of Radio Times from 1923 and right, the 1924 edition. The publication is celebrating its 90th anniversary this year

It was the first ever edition of the publication to feature a colour front cover and was a roaring success - despite the then editor voicing concerns it may put readers off.

Santa
 Claus didn't appear on the cover until 1940, when he
was wearing a helmet in support for the troops fighting in the Second World War.

Despite his slow start, Father Christmas has appeared on the most covers - a grand total of 13 issues.

Celebrities
 have also featured and a period of the 1970s strayed from the tradition hand 
drawn design to photographs of icons such as the Two Ronnies, Morecambe 
and Wise and Frank Spencer.

Party season: The 1925 cover, left, features a couple having a festive dance while the edition from 1933 is particularly striking with its red, white and blue theme

First appearance: Santa graces the front cover for the first time in 1940. The cover from 1953 depicts a traditional scene of children waiting for Father Christmas to arrive

This year's 
cover is a modern take on the 1920s illustrated cover but includes a favourite television character - Raymond Briggs' Father Christmas from 
the animation the Snowman.

The Radio Times is one of the most 
popular British magazines and even received a Guinness World Record in 
1988 for selling over 11.2 million copies that year.

Deputy Editor and art director Shem Law believes it has become an integral part of the British Christmas experience.

Rockin' robin: The 1957 edition features a splendid red-breasted robin happily holding holly in its beak while 1965's cover sees a rather abstract geometric design

Patterned: The cover from 1967 shows an elaborate festive coloured front cover while 1973's edition sees Morecambe and Wise and The Two Ronnies

Crackers: Frank Spencer poses for the 1974 edition while the scene on the 1988 front cover, featuring a ballerina and a jester, is a rather whimsical affair

He
 said: 'The Christmas Radio Times is a tradition and is very, very 
British. It is part of the national psyche and plays an important part 
of everyone's Christmas.

'I 
remember there always being a copy in my house growing up and without me
 even realising it has become a tradition in my own home for my four 
children.

'It is the only Radio Times issue that people will always go out of their way to buy.'

Mr Law added: 'A key part of a British 
Christmas is the family sitting together watching television - circling 
their favourite programmes in the magazine and debating with the family 
what will be watched on each day.

Santa's here! The 1991 cover features Father Christmas, who has graced the cover 13 times in 90 years. An illustration of Harry Potter took centre stage in 2000

It's Christmas, Gromit! Animated figures Wallace
 and Gromit in 2008 and Father Christmas is here once again for this 
year's front cover from classic film The Snowman

'I
 have known people from other cultures to remark that our love for 
Christmas issue is bizarre but that is because they don't have British 
television - nothing is as good as that.'

To celebrate the return of
 Sherlock, this year Radio Times have teamed up with Penguin to give away a free 
copy of The Return of Sherlock Holmes with the double issue.

Shem
 Law has now compiled the book celebrating the 90th Anniversary of the 
Radio Times which features not only Christmas covers but also particularly iconic ones from the rest of the year

The Radio Times Cover Story is available from shop.radiotimes.com starting at Â£20 for the paperback.

Radio Times was first printed on 28 
September 1923. When it launched an issue cost 2d - two old pennies. It only went up to three pennies in 1951.

The magazine only carried broadcast listings for BBC radio and television channels until TV channels were deregulated in 1991.

The ITV-published magazine, TVTimes, carried only ITV and then, from 1982, Channel 4 television listings. Today both publications carry listings for all major channels.

Following deregulation, there was outcry from other listings magazines that Radio Times was advertised on the BBC which gave an unfair advantage to the publication. In the past, there has been controversy around the magazine featuring mainly BBC shows on its front cover - with Dr Who appearing on 29 issues.

Since Christmas 1969, a double-sized 
issue - hailed as 'Legendary' by the magazine's publishers - has been 
released each December containing listings for two weeks of programmes. 
Originally, this covered both Christmas and New Year listings but in 
some years these appear in separate editions.

It was, at one time, the biggest selling publication in Europe. The
 latest circulation figures to June 2013 see the Radio Times it 812,543,
 making it third in the TV listings magazine market behind TV Choice.
