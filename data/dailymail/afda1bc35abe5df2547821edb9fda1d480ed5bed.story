A former 'America's Next Top Model' finalist now serving 12 years for armed burglary has revealed in an emotional jailhouse interview that her lowest point came when she sobered up.

'It was that point when I sobered up and looked around me, and I said "This is my life. This is the path I chose",' Renee Alway told CBS Local 2.

Alway, who appeared on the reality TV show in 2007, spoke out 18 months after she was jailed in Riverside, California following a robbery spree and a six-hour standoff with police.

In the interview, she discussed how she let down her three children - whom she has not seen since she went to jail - and how the glamorous modeling life vanished following the show.

Emotional: Renee Alway broke down in a jailhouse interview as she spoke about how she had let down her three children. The former America's Next Top Model finalist is serving 12 years in prison for robbery

Struggle: She said the hardest point was sobering up after her arrest and seeing what she had become

Alway, then 20, reached the final three contestants in the eighth cycle of the show before taking part in Tyra Banks' show 'Modelville' and appearing in ads and magazines.

But in the months afterwards, she found 'closed door, after closed door, after closed door, and it was just really hard to take', she said.

Speaking to CBS, she said she doesn't know how she slipped from the model to the felon.

'I can't even pinpoint it, but it was a matter of about a year, where, I didn't even recognize me anymore,' the 28-year-old said.

In the months before the arrest, she robbed scores of properties and had become reliant on burglarizing cars and homes as a 'tweaker'.

Police had received multiple reports of a suspicious woman covered in sores.

By the time she was arrested at the end of a SWAT team stand off, 'I remember feeling like "come and get me",' she said.

Caught: She was arrested following a six-hour standoff with police following a spate of robberies

She doesn't' even remember the six hour stand off.

'I remember bits and pieces of it. I remember SWAT. I remember having guns.

"You get to the point where you're like, well, you kind of get of like, forget it then, 'I'm just going to do whatever I do,' and you're numb to it, and you just go for it. You're like, no holds barred."

Despite the dramatic ending to Alway's crime spree, she says it wasn't her lowest moment.

Afterwards, she sobered up and shaved off her blonde locks as 'a metamorphosis' and a sign that she was becoming a new person and shedding her former self.

She revealed her drastic new look as she took a plea deal last month. She pleaded guilty to to four felony burglary counts and one count each of vehicle theft and being a felon in possession of a firearm and was sentenced to 12 years.

Speaking to CBS, she explained that she took the deal to save her family from any further pain.

She had given up custody of her three children before she was arrested and became emotional as she spoke of how she had let them down.

'It's one thing to fail your parents,' she said. 'It's one thing to fail your fans and your friends. It's something completely different to fail your blood, your children.' 

At one point when Always laughed, it became clear she is missing at least one of her top molars. While she shaved her head at her lowest point, she now wears her hair in a mohawk 

Cycle 8: Alway, then 20, finished in the top three of Cycle 8 of 'America's Next Top Model,' which aired in 2007. She is pictured here standing left of host of the show, Tyra Banks

The ANTM finalist was arrested on June 28, 2013 for burglary, fraud, narcotics possession, committing a felony while on bail and other charges.

Officers responding to a report of a suspicious woman walking around a neighborhood spotted a condominium with an open back door, police said.

Neighbors told officers the residents were out of the country and Alway was found hiding in the garage on top of a loaded handgun and a purse containing hypodermic needles, a bag of pills, stolen house keys, garage remotes, plastic zip-ties and handcuffs.
