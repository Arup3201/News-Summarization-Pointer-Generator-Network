It's as traditionally British as bowler hats and afternoon tea.

But it appears that once beloved 
marmalade continues to fall out of favour as the nation’s choice of 
breakfast spread. Sales figures reveal how demand has again fallen over 
the past year as shoppers turn to honey, jam or peanut butter for their 
morning toast.

Overall, the jams and spreads groceries category enjoyed 3.3 per cent growth over the past year.

Marmalade, the favourite sticky treat of Paddington Bear, has been falling in popularity with sales down in 2012, according to market analysts Kantar Worldpanel

Trade magazine The Grocer said: 'In the battle of the bears, Winnie the Pooh has soundly beaten his rival Paddington over the past 12 months.'

The report says Paddington's favourite marmalade is finding itself in a sticky situation with suppliers looking to other spreads to drive growth in the category.

It states the reason for marmalade's decline is because of shoppers switching to jam and honey as well as more contemporary offerings, such as chocolate hazelnut spread and peanut butter, which together helped the jams and spreads category grow by 3.3 per cent in 2012.

It follows figures from last May, which showed a 6 per cent fall.

By contrast, sales of honey rose by 4.1 per cent in value and 3.5 per cent in volume.

The magazine said marmalade certainly has not been helped by its reputation as the grandmother's spread of choice.

One supplier told The Grover: 'Marmalade has an image of being old-fashioned and tired.

'It is one of those things that people can grow into as they get older but if consumers are not identifying with certain brands then that is a real problem.'

Winnie the Pooh is clearly winning in the battle of the bears, as honey sales go up while the popularity of marmalade is in decline
