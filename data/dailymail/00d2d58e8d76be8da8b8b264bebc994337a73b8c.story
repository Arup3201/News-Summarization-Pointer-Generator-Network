India's tourism minister will provide emergency helpline numbers for foreign tourists and a list of dos and don'ts in a bid to prevent further attacks on women.

The proposal comes a week after a 22-year-old Japanese tourist was allegedly lured to a Buddhist shrine then locked in a basement at gunpoint and raped repeatedly by two men.

The rape accusation is the latest in a long list of headline-grabbing attacks on women - both Indian and foreign - which has sent tourism numbers plunging.

Tourism officials estimate that visitors numbers are already down 20 to 30 per cent compared to last year. 

Reports  suggest the latest victim's captors were part of a gang of tour guides who first befriend tourists then sexually exploit them across three states: Bengal, Bihar and Uttar Pradesh. Six men have been arrested.

'The incident is a national shame',  India's tourist minister Mahesh Sharma told reporters.  

Tourism numbers have dropped following a string of high-profile attacks on women

He added to the CNN-IBN news network: 'We are only getting 6.9 million tourists in a year so that's a matter of concern for us. We have to take care of the security of travellers'.

Seven million is a low figure for tourism given the country's size, cultural and architectural heritage, beautiful scenery and diverse ecosystems. 

British nationals make up 800,000 of those visitors.

Despite it's beautiful scenery and size, India attracts less than seven million tourists a year

Even the Taj Mahal is suffering, witnessing a 6.8 per cent decline last year  of foreign visitors from 2013. 

The tourism sector of Agra, the city in which the Taj Mahal resides, has blamed the rising crime rate in the region.

India's Tourism Minister has introduced new measures to try and keep visitors safe

In comparison Thailand receives 27 million tourists a year, almost four times as much as India.

Officials have said by 2016 they want to increase India's share of the world's tourists by one per cent, a small amount for such a large country. Earlier this year a visa-on-arrival system was introduced to make travel there easier.

Mr Sharma also announced plans to reserve train carriages  for tourists who book in advance, with better facilities and possibly security cameras.

Some other attempts to make tourists safer have proved unworkable. 

In the summer of 2013, the National Tourism Advisory Council issued badges for taxi drivers and guides to wear that said 'I respect women'. 

While most stays are trouble-free, the latest advice from the Foreign and Commonwealth Office states: 'Women should use caution when travelling in India. Reported cases of sexual assault against women and young girls are increasing; recent sexual attacks against female visitors in tourist areas and cities show that foreign women are also at risk.

Even tourist hotspots such as Kerala have been affected by the drop in visitor numbers

'British women have been the victims of sexual assault in Goa, Delhi, Bangalore and Rajasthan and women travellers often receive unwanted attention in the form of verbal and physical harassment by individuals or groups of men. 

'Serious sexual attacks involving Polish, German and Danish women travellers were reported in 2014.'

The official advice recommends exercising caution even if in a group and avoiding isolated areas, including beaches, when alone at any time of day.

Female travellers should avoid travelling alone on public transport, taxis or auto-rickshaws and when collected at the airport by a hotel driver, visitors should make sure their drivers properly identify themselves before getting in, they say.

India has faced intense scrutiny over its efforts to curb violence against women after the fatal gang rape of a medical student on a bus in New Delhi in December 2012, which sparked a global outcry.

The most recent attack echoes that of a 25-year-old Japanese woman who was gang-raped in 2010 while she was on her way to the railway station in Gaya.

Official advise from UK foreign office says female lone travellers should take care when getting in rickshaws

Sex attacks against women from Western countries, including the US and Britain, have received major media coverage and tourism bosses are growing wary of their negative impact.

In January 2014 a 51-year-old Danish tourist was robbed and gang-raped at knifepoint in Delhi in a case that grabbed national and international headlines.

In 2013 a Swiss cyclist holidaying in the central state of Madhya Pradesh was robbed and raped by five men, all of whom were later jailed for life.
