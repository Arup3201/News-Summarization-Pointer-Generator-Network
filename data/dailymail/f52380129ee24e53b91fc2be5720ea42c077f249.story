An ex-soldier, dubbed 'Britain's Forrest Gump', has completed an 8,000-mile trek around the coast, taking him 18 months and raising almost £200,000 for the Help for Heroes charity.

Adventurer Christian Nock, 40, set off on August 8 2012, from his local pub in Blackpool - Tommy Docks, and ran across the length and breadth of Britain, battling against the elements.

He completed his journey's final steps by sleeping rough every night, covering every strip of the UK's coast.

Christian Nock (left, centre) was dubbed 
'Britain's Forrest Gump' because of his epic walk, which resembled the 
portion of the classic film which saw the hero (right) trek across the 
U.S.

During his voyage he fought the wet British weather, going through 14 pairs of walking boots throughout the trip.

He beat the flu twice, got blisters, sickness, non-stop rain, suffered several near death experiences and had to use his army skills to survive.

As he finished the 8,000 mile trek, he claimed he cried as he saw Blackpool Tower appear over the horizon, which signalled the end of his voyage.

Christian Nock ended and started his voyage in Blackpool, where he was greeted by many people who celebrated his accomplishments, including the town crier

Mr Nock said: 'I've cried more in the last week than in the last decade. Seeing 
Blackpool Tower just signalled the end and it was extremely emotional.

'Everyone
 who has supported me on the journey throughout - following me on 
Facebook, giving me a hot drink or a sandwich, cheering me on - has 
completely reinstalled my faith in humanity.

'As an ex-infantryman 
myself, I know soldiers struggle returning to life as a civilian. Many 
struggle to reintegrate into normal family life, often due to a lack of 
counselling and support.

'My aim was not only to raise an obscene sum
 of money for Help for Heroes but to enhance public awareness of our 
homeless soldiers by sleeping as they would sleep.

'I suppose I am a modern-day Forrest Gump, but this is no Hollywood movie.'

Mr Nock came up with the idea when his Blackpool B&B went bankrupt, leaving him struggling to find work.

He applied for more than 120 jobs, but got nothing but rejections, and was eventually left homeless and penniless.

He set off to raise £10,000 for Help for Heroes by walking anti-clockwise around the coast from north west England.

When he finished he was greeted by the Blackpool Town Crier.

After sleeping rough for the last 18 months, he hoped to raise awareness of how many ex-servicemen and women who also end up on the streets.

He has accepted hot meals and showers, as well as offers to wash his kit, but he always rejected the offers of a bed for the night.

Nock ended up raising almost double the amount he set out to make during his trek, making £20,000 for Help for Heroes

His plan to sleep rough was often made worse by constant rain, freezing conditions, coupled with landslides and swollen rivers which made it dangerous to sleep outside.

While his original plan was to raise £10,000 for Help for Heroes, he almost doubled this with his total of nearly £20,000.

Bryn Parry, CEO and Co-Founder of Help for Heroes said: "What Christian has achieved is nothing short of astonishing.

'Since Help for Heroes launched six years ago, the Great British public has done many remarkable things, but Christian's walk is unique.

'We have never heard of anyone contemplating this challenge, let alone completing it.

'Choosing to walk such a long distance over a sustained period of time - whilst sleeping rough to raise attention of homelessness - has required huge personal sacrifices by Christian.

'As a result of these sacrifices, Christian has raised an incredible amount of money which will help us provide practical, direct support to Servicemen, women and veterans who have suffered life-changing injuries and illnesses.'
