Police have found more than 850 'stolen' objects in a tiny pond - including precious jewellery, pistols and a machete -  thanks to one very curious dog.

An unsuspecting woman was walking her pet in Whitebeam Woods near Worthing, West Sussex, when it scampered away and returned with a soggy jacket.

When the pet made another dive and brought up a pair of cufflinks, the owner called police who discovered and retrieved an astonishing hoard of missing treasure.

Haul: Police in Worthing, West Sussex, recovered more than 850 items including handguns, a machete and hundreds of pieces of stolen jewellery from a secluded pond after a curious dog dived in and found cufflinks

Sentimental: One of the bracelets was engraved simply with the name Karen. The objects are believed stolen

Mystery: There are few clues to be had from the watches, which all appear to have stopped at a different time

The mud-clogged underwater cache included pistols, earrings, watches, necklaces, rings, brooches, cufflinks, coins and even a large machete.

Many are believed to be precious, sentimental items which were stolen from victims' homes and which thieves were then unable to sell.

One bracelet was engraved simply: 'Karen'.

Forensics officers who are more used to examining murders and rapes spent weeks painstakingly cleaning the hundreds of objects so they could be identified.

Scores of images of the huge cache have now been uploaded to Sussex Police's website in the hope the owners will come forward.

Search: A specialist police search team went into the pond and retrieved the hundreds of dumped items

Small: The cache of almost 1,000 sentimental treasures was crammed into a space just a few yards wide

A Sussex Police spokesman told MailOnline: 'We don't know whether it's things that they couldn't sell or whether they've panicked and had to throw everything away.

'What we do know is the items weren't in bags and a lot of them were not designed to be in the water, so it's unlikely someone was using it as an underwater storage tank.

'It's not the sort of place you go to as a passer-by so we believe whoever dumped these objects probably had a knowledge of the area.'

He added: 'A lot of these items are going to be very personal and sentimental. Some of them are engraved.

'They may not have any great financial value but the owners will be able to describe them in great detail.'

Necklaces: Officers said many items are likely to have little financial worth but will be highly recognisable

Crime: Crucially once more objects begin to be claimed police will have more chance of finding the thieves

Characteristic: The items taken from the pond included a whole section of owl-based pendants and earrings

Currency: Some of the items have more value than others - and there are a number of rusting coins in the heap

The dog-owner first raised the alarm over the mammoth find on July 23, triggering a hunt by Sussex Police's specialist search unit.

There is no vehicle access to the pond, and officers believe it would have been a weighty haul for one person to carry through the woods on their own.

The treasure was also found scattered across the bed of the pond, suggesting it was dumped on separate trips or by multiple people.

A handful of the the items' owners have now come forward, providing police with vital details about how the objects were connected.

Precious: None of the items were put in bags before they were scattered into disparate parts of the pond

Old and new: Some of the items are encrusted with jewels and would likely have been reported stolen before

A police spokesman said: 'A lot of these items are going to be very personal and sentimental'

Scores of images of the huge cache, thought to be one of the largest of its kind, have been put online

Detective Constable Emma Fields said: 'We have already identified some of the items as having been stolen in burglaries in Sussex but we want to find out who owns the rest of them'. The full list is available online

Detective Constable Emma Fields said: 'Many of these items are not particularly expensive but could hold great personal value to the owners.
