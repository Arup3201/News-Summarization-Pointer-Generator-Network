Road rage: Mario Perez-Tano, 83, allegedly fired two shots at a motorist who cut him off on a Florida highway on Friday

Police in Miami said the incident began after Miguel Garcia pulled out of a tire shop and turned into traffic. He cut off a red VW Beetle that was being driven by Perez-Tano.

Witnesses told Local 10 News the two drivers began to argue when Perez-Tano got out of the VW and fired two shots.

Garcia wasn't hit and sped off with Perez-Tano in hot pursuit.

The pair came to a halt by a drawbridge over Miami River that had been raised.

Henry Laurido, the owner of the tire shop, was with his two daughters when they witnessed what happened.

'The bad thing about it is the bridge came up, and it caught everybody,' Laurido told Local 10.

'What's going through my mind is that I'm about to witness a murder. I have kids. I told them to duck because you never know.'

Laurido's 13-year-old daughter, Ashlyn, also saw the commotion.

'It was a super scary sight. First I thought it was fireworks, but I looked up and saw a guy pointing a gun. My dad told me and my sister to get down and we both dropped to the floor. It was super scary,' Ashlynn said.

Miami police officers in the area arrived and arrested Perez-Tano.

Garcia was treated by Miami Fire Rescue and released at the scene for minor injuries.

Police said Perez-Tano was charged with attempted murder and is being held without bail.
