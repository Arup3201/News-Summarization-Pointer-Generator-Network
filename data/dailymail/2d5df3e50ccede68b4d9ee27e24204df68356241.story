With her flowing robes and long hair swirling in the water around her, this woman could be King Arthur's Lady of the Lake.

These captivating photographs illustrate a different legend, however.

This is a recreation of the 'Lady of the Orda Cave', a spirit said to inhabit the world's longest underwater cave in freezing Siberia.

Ghostly: This is a recreation of the 'Lady of Orda Cave', a spirit said to inhabit the world's longest underwater cave

Beautiful: The project is the brainchild of award-winning photographer Victor Lyagushkin. He admitted the dive is risky but that the reward was 'to see something that nobody has seen before'

The cave lies beneath Russia's Ural Mountains and the waters are so clear you can see for 50 yards.

Former champion free diver Natalia Avseenko spent two days in the icy water recreating the myth with the help of other cave divers.

The 37-year-old held her breath for up to three minutes at a time at depths of 17m while posing in flowing robes on top of a wet suit.

Despite the chill and the threat of danger, she described her experience as 'incredible', mysterious and beautiful'.

Harsh conditions: Temperatures inside the cave reach -23C while the water is 5C

Dangerous: Ms Avseenko found the shoot demanding and it took its toll causing significant pain to her exposed eyes and face

Eerie: Ms Avseenko held her breath for up to three minutes at a time to depths of 17metres while posing in flowing robes

She said: ‘It felt as if I was in Alice in Wonderland.'

‘I was scared to enter the cave at the beginning but having squeezed through the narrow entrance I entered a beautiful hall.

‘It
 felt as if I was in a natural cathedral. I thought it would be dark and
 scary inside but I had light and everything was visible.

‘There is a feeling of being in complete silence and harmony. There are no thoughts inside your mind.

‘I
 realised the greatness of nature and the universe. I was full of joy 
and harmony. All the fears were disappearing one by one. I had no inner 
battles and I just let all my inner-garbage go.’

The setting: A support diver swims through the crystal clear waters of Orda Cave in the Ural region of Russia

Taking in the view: Free diver Natalia Avseenko watches the horizon outside Orda Cave, where the temperatures can reach -40C, in the Ural Mountains

Frozen: Ms Avseenko, 37, walks into the depths of the chilly cave. She spent two days in icy water recreating the myth of the 'Lady of Orda Cave' with the help of other divers

Conditions were harsh with 
temperatures reaching -40C outside, while inside the cave was slightly 
warmer at -23C and the water itself at a less-than-balmy +5C.

Yoga
 expert Ms Avseenko, who has previously held her breath underwater for 
10 minutes and 40 seconds, found the shoot physically demanding.

Diving without face equipment took its toll causing significant pain to her exposed eyes and face.

The
 project was the brainchild of award-winning photographer and filmmaker 
Victor Lyagushkin, 42, who has led previous expeditions to capture the 
eerie beauty of the crystal cave.

He
 uses an underwater funnel to stop oxygen bubbles damaging the delicate 
edges of the cave, which are made of gypsum - a soft calcium mineral.

Final touches: A diver helps Ms Avseenko as she enters the water in full costume

The project sprung into life after Mr Lyagushkin, from Moscow, came across a legendary tale about a spirit dwelling in the depths.

Some divers will even decide not to dive on a certain day they feel a presence or tiny glitches with their equipment.

One diver describes the feeling as an 'inquisitive, jealous and purely female glance... like an elder sister'.

Despite this slight foreboding, every risk was calculated to ensure maximum safety for everyone involved.

Freezing: Ms Avseenko wraps up warm after her dive. Although she was scared at first, she said she was 'full of joy and harmony' and that all her fears disappeared one by one

Mr Lyagushkin added: ‘Is it risky? The answer is yes.'

‘You must be aware of each step or you will die.

‘There are hundreds of ways to die in a cave, and many divers never come back. [none have died in Orda Cave to date].

‘But the reward is the possibility to see something beautiful - something that nobody has seen before.

‘For millions of years this amazing place existed, water formed in the palace and no human was here.

‘It is a special feeling. I think the same feeling a cosmonaut would have on the moon.’
