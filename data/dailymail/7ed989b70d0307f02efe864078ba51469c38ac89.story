A mother whose 14-year-old daughter was killed during a shooting at a neighbourhood barbecue tried desperately to save her life, it emerged today.

Shyanne Charles's mother pumped her chest and screamed, 'Keep awake, keep awake' as the teenager lay bleeding to death on the ground.

The east Toronto community party came to a shockingly violent end on Monday night, after a gunman opened fire and left 23 people injured and one other person,  23-year-old Joshua Yasay, dead.

Her grandfather said last night he would miss 'everything' about Shyanne, especially her 'big heart.'

Tyrone Charles added: 'She was an angel. That’s what she was to me. She was a light.'

A classmate from elementary school, 
Natasha, said Shyanne had just finished Grade 9 at West Hill Collegiate.

The other victim, Mr Yasay, texted his close friend Steven minutes before his death.

'He was messaging me saying he doesn’t know why he’s there, it’s not his kind of crowd,' said his friend. 'I messaged back and said, Don’t be there, just leave.'

Investigation: Toronto police search the scene where a 23-year-old man and a 14-year-old girl were killed

The messages stopped at 10.16 pm, shortly before the shooting began.

Shyanne was 'nice to everyone,' said Natasha, at a vigil outside the girl’s home attended by more than 100 mourners last night.

Neighbours held roses and 
candles to honour the memory of Shyanne, who loved to dance, play basketball and go shopping with her girlfriends.

'There was very little time when she 
didn’t have a big smile on her face,' said Ben Lo, co-ordinator of child
and youth programmes at the Scarborough boys and girls club, of which Shyanne was a member for nearly 10 years.

She was always offering to help staff and encouraging younger kids to play sports or learn how to dance,he added.

'Her positivity just oozed out of her,' 
added Mr Lo. 'She’d give you the shirt right off her back... There’s 
nobody that I knew that has ever met her that couldn’t say, "I love 
Shyanne".'

Earlier yesterday, community workers described Shyanne to the Scarborough Star as an energetic and popular neighbourhood youth, who 
looked out for her siblings.

Shyanne’s many friends were filled with
grief and anger at the horrific episode yesterday.

'A lot of young people aren’t doing too well 
right now,' said Likwa Nkala, manager of resource development at East 
Metro Youth Services.

Jam Johnson, who runs the 
Neighbourhood Basketball Association, a city-wide sports programme that 
helps troubled youths, called Shyanne — who he coached — 'a good girl.'

'If she saw me on the other side of the street she’d cross over to say hi,' he said. 'What a waste.'

Former classmate Keisha Newton, 15, added: 'Whenever I had a problem or something, she always knows what to tell me to calm me down,' said

Around a dozen teenagers yesterday afternoon
visited the scene, by then lined with police cars and television 
trucks. They carried a bouquet of yellow and orange daisies, and signs 
that read 'Forever in our heart' and '#PrayForShyanne'.

'We don’t have her anymore, she won’t
be by our sides anymore,' said a friend, who asked not to be 
identified, her voice shaking and eyes tearing.

'People feel the need to come here 
and start drama for no reason. Starting shooting guns because they want 
to be somebody cool. They want to be remembered as something when really
they’re nothing because they took away someone we can never get back.'

Under scrutiny: Police officers take notes at a crime scene - police made an appeal for witnesses to contact them as they began to pull together descriptions for what appeared to be multiple shooters

Many
of those hurt were injured in the panic that ensued after shots were 
fired in Scarborough, a suburb in east Toronto just before 11pm on 
Monday.

'It is the most serious crime of its kind that has ever taken place in the city of Toronto,' said Police Chief Bill Blair.

Police have made appeals for 
witnesses to contact them as they began to pull together descriptions 
for what appeared to be multiple shooters.

A
handgun was recovered near the scene, and Mr Blair said one of the 
injured was considered “a person of interest,' but they are still  looking for other suspects.

'An
altercation broke out among some individuals and there was an exchange 
of gunfire. During that gunfire a number of innocent bystanders were 
struck,' said Mr Blair.

'It's a very shocking event, a lot of people were injured tonight.'

Coming barely six weeks after a shooting at a shopping mall that killed one and wounded six, it is likely to raise fears about the use of guns in a city which takes pride in its relatively low crime rate compared with US urban centres.

At the time of last shooting in Toronto's Eaton Centre, the city's mayor, Rob Ford, described it as an isolated incident in 'the safest city in the world.'

Claudia Wilson, told the Toronto Star that her 20-year-old daughter was at the barbecue when the shooting took place.

'Suddenly she was dodging bullets over there,' said Wilson, her daughter crying nearby.

'They were all in one place and all of a sudden the shots were fired, no one knows where they came from.'
