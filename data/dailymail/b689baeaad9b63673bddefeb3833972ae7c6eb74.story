Bookmakers William Hill has slashed 
the odds of Zara Phillips and Mike Tindall naming their baby Poppy from 
33/1 to just 8/1 – following a rush of overnight betting.

Spokesman
 Rupert Adams said: ‘We saw a real gamble on William and Kate choosing 
George and we could be forced to pay out for a second time if the 
Tindalls choose Poppy.’

Other
 favourites for the youngest royal’s name are Charlotte at 4/1, Victoria
 at 6/1 and Anne at 7/1. Elizabeth, Catherine and Isobella are 
level-pegging at 10/1.

William
 Hill is also offering bets at 50/1 that Zara’s daughter will be an 
Olympian and at 33/1 that she plays international rugby like her father.

Princess Anne (seen at her estate on Friday where her new granddaughter is believed to be) broke with tradition and gave her daughter Zara a name not readily associated with the British Royal Family

Zara gave birth to a 7lbs 12oz baby girl at Gloucestershire Royal Hospital on Friday, with her husband Mike Tindall present at the birth.

There has been wide-spread speculation as to what Zara will call her daughter - especially as her own mother, the Princess Royal, broke with tradition when naming her.

But Poppy has become a firm favourite after Adele Horton, 30, said her brother Tom spoke to Zara at a rugby match in November.

Miss
 Horton, a support worker from Gloucester, said: 'My brother was down at
 the rugby and he quite often sees Zara because she is sometimes down in
 the stands.

'He saw her
 at the Japan game on November 12 and told her that his girlfriend was 
due the same time and that they were thinking about the name Teddy, so 
she better not steal it.

'She was having a joke back and saying that they were thinking of Poppy - so maybe that will be the name.'

Zara and Mike could pick a moniker for their baby that harks back to monarchs of the past

But Zara and Mike could equally pick a moniker for their baby that harks back to monarchs of the past.

Among other favourites with bookmakers are Charlotte, Elizabeth, Victoria and Anne.

Queen
 Charlotte, who was born in 1744, was married to George III. Charlotte 
was actually her second name - her first being Sophie.

A keen botanist, she founded Kew Gardens, had 15 children - 13 of whom survived - and was a patron of the arts.

Some historians have argued that she was of African descent. Her 
daughter, born in 1766, was also called Charlotte and later known as the
 Princess Royal.

George IV also named his only child Charlotte, but she died in childbirth at the age of 21, leading to a mass outpouring of grief across the nation.

Elizabeth is a highly respected name amongst the monarchy.

Anne, seen, with Zara on her Christening day, has a close relationship with her daughter, who has praised her parenting skills and hopes to follow in her footsteps

The Queen is held in great respect by her family. Zara's great-grandmother the Queen Mother was also Elizabeth.

Elizabeth I, the last Tudor monarch who ruled from 1558 until 1603.

Victoria
 would pay tribute to the longest reigning British monarch so far. 
Victoria ruled for more than 63 years, acceding to the throne in 1837. 
Britain had evolved into a constitutional monarchy.

She became the figurehead of a vast empire and her reign spanned the rest of the century.

She married Prince Albert and had nine children, but mourned his early death for the rest of her life.

Anne could refer to either Zara's mother, the Princess Royal, or Queen Anne, who was the last of the Stuart monarchs. She became Queen aged 37 in 1702 and reigned until her death in 1714.

Married to Prince George of Denmark she gave birth to more than a dozen children but none survived her.

Anne suffered from poor health and her weight ballooned towards the end of her life.
