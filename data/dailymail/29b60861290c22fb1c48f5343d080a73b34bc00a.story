Having a car that can drive itself has long been the stuff of science fiction. But scientists have now created a robot car – controlled by an iPad.

And the Oxford University team says the technology could be installed in mainstream cars within 15 years.

It means futuristic vehicles, like David Hasselhoff’s KITT in the 1980s TV series Knight Rider, could soon be driving us on the commute and school run.

LOOK NO HANDS

RobotCar, a specially adapted Nissan Leaf electric car, has small cameras and lasers built into its chassis.

When the car is driven manually the lasers and cameras act as its ‘eyes’, mapping a 3D model of its surroundings, which is fed into a computer stored in the boot.

The car can then ‘remember’ roads and suburbs, allowing it to drive itself along familiar routes.

It asks the driver via an iPad on the dashboard whether they want to engage the autopilot and, at a touch of the screen, the car takes over the controls.

A laser under the front bumper scans the direction of travel around 13 times per second for obstacles, such as pedestrians, cyclists, or other cars, up to 164ft ahead and in an 85 degree field of view.

If the car sees an obstacle, it slows and comes to a controlled stop. The driver can also tap the brake pedal, like in current cruise control systems, to regain control from the computer at any time.

Car in control: An Oxford University scientist demonstrates their newly developed navigation system

The
 scientists behind the system say it is far superior to conventional 
satellite navigation because it is much more precise – reading to within
 a fraction of an inch compared with a few yards with sat-nav – and the 
car does not need a satellite reference to know where it is.

At
 £5,000, the prototype is also far cheaper than any other currently in 
development – and the aim is to produce one for as little as £100 in the
 near future.

Project leader
 Professor Paul Newman, of Oxford University’s engineering science 
department, said that the technology would be especially valuable for 
drivers who perform regular routes, such the daily commute or school 
run.

He added: ‘We are 
working on a low-cost auto drive navigation system that doesn’t depend 
on GPS, done with discreet sensors that are getting cheaper all the 
time.

‘It’s easy to imagine that this kind of technology could be in a car you could buy.

Accept? Tapping on the brakes returns control of the vehicle to the driver

‘Instead
 of imagining some cars driving themselves all of the time, we should 
imagine a time when all cars can drive themselves some of the time.

‘The sort of low-cost, low-footprint autonomy we are developing is what’s needed for everyday use.’

Last year, Google announced a self-driving car which it said had covered more than 140,000 miles on American roads.

The RobotCar has fewer sensors and relies more heavily on an on-board 3D street map.

The
 basic map could potentially be maintained by local councils or highway 
authorities and regularly updated by vehicles. For insurance reasons, 
the RobotCar has so far only been allowed to drive on autopilot on the 
private roads of Begbroke Science Park, Oxford.

But the scientists are in talks with the Department for Transport to see how and when it could be used on public roads.

The
 next stage of the research will be to make the car recognise and 
understand complex traffic flows and make decisions on which routes to 
take.

Professor Newman 
added: ‘While there’s lots more work to do, it shows the potential for 
this kind of affordable robotic system that could make our car journeys 
safer, more efficient and more pleasant for drivers.’

‘Instead of imagining some cars driving themselves all of the time we 
should imagine a time when all cars can drive themselves some of the 
time. The sort of very low-cost, low-footprint autonomy we are 
developing is what’s needed for everyday use.’

Already there are cars 
that can park themselves and last year Google announced its self-driving
 car saying that it had covered more than 140,000 miles on American 
roads.

Look, no hands! The car would take over the driving on familiar routes

The car can sense people in the road and stop when in autodrive mode

The Oxford car differs from Google’s by having fewer sensors and relying
 more heavily on an on-board three dimensional map of streets.

The basic map could potentially be maintained by local councils or highway authorities and regularly updated by vehicles.

For insurance, legal and health and safety reasons, the RobotCar has so 
far only been allowed to drive on private roads around the scientists’ 
Begbroke Science Park on autopilot. But they are currently in talks with
 the Department of Transport to see how and when it could be used on 
public roads.

The next stage of their research, which is part funded by the 
Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council and is a 
collaboration between the university and sponsors Nissan, Guidance 
Navigation and Mira, will be to make the car recognise and understand 
complex traffic flows and make decisions on which routes to take.

The Department for Transport estimates that cost of congestion will rise
 to £24billion a year by 2025 so vehicles, like this prototype, could 
help alleviate some of those costs by avoiding jams and giving the 
driver time off to do other tasks.

Prof Newman added: ‘While there’s lots more work to do, it shows the 
potential for this kind of affordable robotic system that could make our
 car journeys safer, more efficient and more pleasant for drivers.’
