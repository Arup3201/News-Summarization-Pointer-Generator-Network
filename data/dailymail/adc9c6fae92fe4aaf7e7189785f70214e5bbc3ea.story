The David Moyes era is slowly but surely fading away and with it, so are the former Manchester United manager's players.

The 2013-14 squad photograph has a few faces that are still lurking around the Old Trafford corridors - such as Marouane Fellaini and Anderson - but who's been ushered towards the exit? The team photo from September 26, 2013 tells all.

Louis van Gaal has stripped and sold the scraps for parts in what appears to be an exciting new attacking era for those in the red half of Manchester.

A total of 17 players or staff have left the club since the beginning of the 2013-14 season under David Moyes - United finished seventh in the Premier League

Back row: Danny Welbeck, Phil Jones, Chris Smalling, Jonny Evans, Marouane Fellaini, Rio Ferdinand, Michael Carrick, Robin van Persie

Third Row: Masseur Garry Armer, performance analyst Paul Brand, head of fitness Tony Strudwick, Antonio Valencia, Darren Fletcher, Wilfried Zaha, Adnan Januzaj, Fabio da Silva, masseur Rod Thornley, kit Manager Alec Wylie, physio Neil Hough

Second Row: Assistant kit manager Ian Buckingham, physio Rob Swire, Dr Steve McNally, Alexander Buttner, Sam Johnstone, Anders Lindegaard, David de Gea, Ben Amos, Ashley Young, coach Phil Neville, masseur Andy Caveney, goalkeeping coach Chris Woods

Front Row: Shinji Kagawa, Rafael da Silva, Anderson, Nani, assistant Manager Steve Round, Ryan Giggs, manager David Moyes, Nemanja Vidic, coach Jimmy Lumsden, Patrice Evra, Javier "Chicharito" Hernandez, Tom Cleverley and Wayne Rooney

Danny Welbeck (back row, far left)

The striker was sick of playing second fiddle to Wayne Rooney, Robin van Persie and Co and joined Arsenal for £16million in a deadline-day move. Under Moyes, he averaged just 58 minutes per game.

Danny Welbeck left Manchester United for Arsenal in a £16million, described as the 'bargain of the century'

Rio Ferdinand (back row, third from right)

The defender makes a tasty return to Old Trafford on Sunday with Queens Park Rangers and will be told to try and contain Radamel Falcao and United's new attacking line-up. Former England international Ferdinand turned down two other London clubs in favour of joining Harry Redknapp at Loftus Road.

Wilfried Zaha (third row, sixth from right)

Zaha never truly got going at United, making just two Premier League appearances, and the winger was given permission to return to Crystal Palace, a club he helped win promotion to the top flight in 2013, on a season-long loan.

Fabio da Silva (third row, fourth from right)

Now on the books of Cardiff City, the full-back left United after spending a year on loan at QPR. In his six years in Manchester, Fabio managed just 22 Premier League appearances, compared with his brother, Rafael, who has broken the 100 mark.

Alexander Buttner (second row, fourth from left)

Buttner joined Dynamo Moscow after spending two years with United. The 25-year-old left for £4.4m, having made just 13 Premier League appearances and scoring twice. Van Gaal deemed Buttner surplus to requirements following the signing of Luke Shaw from Southampton.

Coach Phil Neville (second row, third from right)

Former Everton defender Neville was reunited with Moyes at United, becoming the first-team coach. The 37-year-old is now concentrating on his career as a pundit for the BBC, and following in the footsteps of his brother, Gary.

Shinji Kagawa (front row, far left)

Kagawa was never loved at Old Trafford the same way he was at Borussia Dortmund and the attacking midfielder returned to the Bundesliga club for £6.3m on a four-year contract.

Nani (front row, fourth from left)

Nani left to join former club Sporting Lisbon on a season-long loan and, in his own way, helped with the arrival of Marcos Rojo. Nani made 147 appearances in the Premier League and scored 25 goals.

Assistant manager Steve Round (front row, fifth from left)

The departure of Moyes caused a ripple effect which was felt by his back-room staff. Round, United's assistant manager during the year they finished seventh, was relieved of his duties.

Manager David Moyes (front row, centre)

United did not qualify for the Champions League for the first time in 19 years and the Old Trafford club had never finished outside of the Premier League top three before. Both records were smashed. The former Everton boss and his coaching staff were paid £5.2m compensation for the sacking.

Nemanja Vidic (front row, sixth from right)

After eight years at the club and five Premier League titles - not to mention a Champions League win - Vidic decided enough was enough. The centre-back joined Inter Milan after seeing out his contract.

Nemanja Vidic spent eight years at Manchester United and won five Premier League titles during his stint

Coach Jimmy Lumsden (front row, fifth from right)

Another to suffer the same fate as Moyes. Lumsden parted company with the club at the same time as assistant manager Round after it all fell apart at Old Trafford.

Patrice Evra (front row, fourth from right)

After a mammoth 273 Premier League appearances, Evra joined Serie A club Juventus on a two-year deal. The fee was £1.2m for the 33-year-old, who now seems destined to see out his career in Italy.

Javier 'Chicharito' Hernandez (front row, third from right)

Hernandez was surplus to requirements up front and fell behind in the pecking order, particularly with the arrival of Radamel Falcao. The striker joined Real Madrid on a season-long loan and the Spanish giants have the option to buy at the end of the deal.

Tom Cleverley (front row, second from right)

Cleverley has been in and out of Manchester since 2009, taking in loans at Leicester, Watford and Wigan, and the midfielder has joined Aston Villa for another temporary spell. The 25-year-old would have warmed the bench with Ander Herrera, Angel di Maria and Daley Blind arriving as summer signings.

And the rest:

Chris Woods - goalkeeping coach - Woods was told alongside Phil Neville that he would no longer be needed at the club after Moyes' departure in May.

Rob Swire - physio - retired in July after being at Manchester United since 1999. He was replaced by assistant Neil Hough.
