You'd have thought there's not a lot that can go wrong when putting up a huge road sign.

But council workers in Oldham showed just how tricky it can be when they installed a 'Welcome' sign ... upside down.

After stepping back to admire their handiwork on Lees Street in Chadderton and not realising anything was a amiss they then packed up and headed off to their next job.

What happened next is a bit of a mystery as local resident Andrew Robinson, who took a picture of the error, says it stayed that way overnight while council officials insist it was turned the right way up within an hour of being wrongly fitted.

Whoops! Staff working for Oldham council failed to notice their wonky sign blunder on Lees Street in Chadderton

Mr Robinson said: 'I couldn't believe it when I saw two workmen packing up after replacing the sign with a new one upside down.Â 

'I checked again in the morning and took some photographs because I thought I'd either dreamt it or can't have seen it properly.

'I really can't believe the level of 
incompetence shown by Oldham council and find the tag line 'working for a
co-operative borough' ironic.

'Surely they can't have left without looking at it? How hard is it to put up a sign?'

A council spokesman said: 'A genuine 
error was made by staff. We were notified by the public that same day 
and it was rectified within an hour.'

The new sign was designed to show the
Chadderton crest. Michael Lawson, of Chadderton Historical Society, 
which campaigned to have the crest included, said: 'I understand 
councillor Jim McMahon is making a big impression on the borough and 
turning things upside down but we didn't think he was going this far.

Mistake: Workmen spent two hours carefully creating a road marking only to mis-spell it as 'Loading OLNY' in Lynmouth, Devon

'On a serious note we think that he is doing a great job and he has our full support. It's marvellous to see the crest up.

'It makes us proud of the township and the metropolitan borough and shows we are all moving in the same direction.'

Meanwhile, workmen spent two hours carefully creating a road marking only to mis-spell it as 'Loading OLNY'.

The glaring error, written in clear, white paint, was left in the centre of the village of Lynmouth, Devon.

Parking rebels in the village are refusing to obey the message claiming it is not enforceable because of the mistake.

Jo Backhouse, from Lynmouth Stores, said: 'Not a lot of people noticed the mistake at first as it is not that obvious until you cross the road.

'But we have all had a laugh about it in the shop.'
