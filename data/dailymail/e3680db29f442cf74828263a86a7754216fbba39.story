A five-year-old girl died on board the stricken the Costa Concordia after she and her father were turned away from a lifeboat, it emerged today.

Dayana Arlotti and her father William Arlotti fell into a flooded part of the stricken cruise ship and drowned as they tried to cross to the other side after no one offered to give up their space.

The pair had tried to get aboard a lifeboat on the port side but nobody offered them a space. A crew member had directed them to the starboard side but as they tried to make it across the ship rolled over.

Their harrowing story is included in a 60 page dossier detailing the final moments of each of the 32 victims of the cruise ship ran aground off the coast of Tuscany in January last year.

The disgraced captain, Francesco Schettino was branded a coward and widely criticised for abandoning ship after making an ill-fated detour by  to the island of Giglio, where the ship hit a rock tearing a massive hole in its belly.

Prosecutors have produced the dossier in a bid to have Schettino brought to trial charged with manslaughter and abandoning ship.

Recounting the final moments of Dayana 
Arlotti and her father it states: 'They could not find a place on the 
life boats on the port side.

'They
were directed by crew to the starboard side of the same deck. But while
they were crossing the corridor inside the vessel, the ship rolled over
causing them to fall into a flooded part of the deck.'

Among the others to have lost their lives aboard the Costa Concordia was 30-year-old Musician Giuseppe Girolamo.

Tragedy: The Costa Concordia capsized on January 13 2012 with 4,252 passengers and crew on board, 32 people died

Grim task: Divers search for the bodies of the missing victims of the Costa Concordia disaster

Girolamo,
a drummer from Bari, on his first cruise as crew, showed extraordinary 
courage when he gave up his place on a life boat for a child. But he 
paid the ultimate price.

The
dossier documented: 'Having not found a place in the boats on starboard
side he was directed by crew members to the port side.

'After
giving up his place on a life boat to facilitate the boarding of 
passengers he drowned in waters off the resort of Gabbianara.’

Honeymoon bride Maria D'Introno, who 
had boarded the doomed liner with her groom and other relatives who were
celebrating a golden wedding anniversary had managed to get on a life 
raft.

But she was forced to
reboard the ship 'because the lifeboat was leaning excessively to one 
side and was deemed unsafe to fall into the sea.’

Disaster: The document also lists hundreds of 
passengers and crew who suffered injuries as well as those that have 
suffered from insomnia and post-traumatic stress disorder since the 
tragedy

The 30-year-old was directed to the port 
side but, because of the 'rising waters' was forced to take to the sea. 
She could not swim.

Russel Rebello, a 33-year-old crew 
member from India who worked in housekeeping, 'remained on the ship to 
organise the launch of the final passenger life rafts, but fell into the
sea at the last roll of the ship.' He drowned.

passengers and crew who suffered injuries as well as those that have 
suffered from insomnia and post-traumatic stress disorder since the 
tragedy.

Sorrow: Flowers thrown by family members of missing victims from the Costa Concordia cruise ship bob in the sea

It repeats allegatios that Schettino was distracted from his duties by the presence on the bridge of a Moldovan former dancer.

Schettino is accused of altering the course of the ship so that it 
sailed close to the picturesque coast in a bid to impress passengers and
crew, as well as locals waiting on a nearby island.

But the liner instead sailed straight
into the path of the rock, which tore a 70-metre hole into the side of 
the Costa Concordia's hull before becoming lodged inside the vessel.

More than 4,000 holidaymakers and 
crew were on board when the disaster struck just three hours after the 
ship left port for the start of a Mediterranean cruise on January 13.

At the time, coastguards said they had
'never seen' anything like it and described the lodged rock as 'unique 
in maritime history'.

A preliminary hearing has been set for April 15.
