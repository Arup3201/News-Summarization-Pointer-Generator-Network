Two Brits were among 51 people arrested as police smashed a huge international drug trafficking gang flooding the UK with cannabis.

Spanish police seized 1640 kilos of cannabis worth £5 million as well as four speed boats, 17 cars, vans and motorbikes used to smuggle the narcotics.

Police said the organisation was made up of Spaniards, Moroccans, Russians, Brits, Germans, Dutch and Romanians.

They allegedly smuggled millions of pounds worth of cannabis from north Africa into Europe.

Armed officers swooped on 11 properties and seized computers, mobile phones and machinery for packaging the drugs.

The police  operation, codenamed Mirka, was launched in August 2011 by the Civil Guard and National Police.

It is thought the two Brits were arrested in Coin, near Malaga.

Spain's interior ministry said in a 
statement: 'This network transported the drugs in speedboats from 
Morocco, unloading the boats on beaches on the Spanish coast which was 
later hidden in vehicles to be transported to other EU countries.

The joint operation between the Spanish Police and the Civil Guard, 
codenamed Mirka, saw two British men arrested in Coin near Malaga

'The drugs heading to the United Kingdom were packaged in a warehouse in Coin, Malaga, where police discovered a secret room, hidden behind some shelving, used to vacuum pack the cannabis resin.'

Drugs were seized in the provinces of Malaga, Seville, Alicante, Girona, Barcelona and Cadiz.

The police would not give any more information on the two Brits under arrest.
