One of four boys who fell into an icy pond outside Baltimore over the weekend has died, authorities said on Tuesday.

Kyron Aikens, 13, died sometime Monday night or early on Tuesday morning while being treated in the pediatric intensive care unit at Johns Hopkins Hospital, said Cpl. John Wachter, a spokesman for Baltimore County Police Department.

Kyron and three other boys, ages 8 to 12, fell through ice into a pond Sunday afternoon near a high school.

Dead: Kyron Aikens, 13, died sometime Monday night or early on Tuesday morning after falling into a frozen lake with too thin ice

Thin Ice: One of four boys who fell in this frozen pond over the weekend, 13-year-old Kyron Aikens, has died 

Tragic: Kyron Aikens' death could have been prevented had he not made the decision with friends to walk across the icy water too weak to hold his weight 

Bystanders pulled a 12-year-old boy from the water, while the two other boys made it to the shore on their own.

Witnesses said that almost immediately after falling through the ice, Kyron went under the water, said Lt. Norm Simpkins Jr. of the Arbutus Volunteer Fire Department, one of the first responders at the scene.

'They said he went in and they did not see him come up at all,' Simpkins said. 

'He never resurfaced.'

Rescue crews in boats combed the murky, 8-foot-deep pond using poles in hopes of finding Kyron before divers arrived and joined the search underwater, Simpkins said.

He said one of his crew members found Kyron using a pole, and that a diver brought him up soon after that.

Kyron was pulled from the water unconscious and undergoing cardiac arrest about 80 minutes after crews were first dispatched to the scene, according to a Baltimore County police timeline of the rescue.

Simpkins said it was unclear why Kyron was unable to make it out of the water, adding that it may be that the teen didn't know how to swim or that he got trapped beneath the ice and couldn't find an opening in time.

Rushed to safety: Kyron Aikens suffered cardiac arrest and was rushed to the hospital where he later died

Walk of danger: A show remains on the icy pond where four boys decided to walk across, putting all of their lives in danger and leading to one's untimely death 

Safety measures: Fire officials warned to never walk on frozen ponds because the ice may be too thin and it

The boy saved by bystanders, 12-year-old Chive Omar Benjamin, also was in cardiac arrest after being rescued and remained in serious condition Tuesday at Johns Hopkins.

Two boys, Junior Wilbert Thomas, 8, and Jujuan Wilder, 12, were transported to St. Agnes Hospital and have been released.

ABC  reports that witnesses said  they saw four boys walking across the pond when they fell through thin ice just one to two inches thick. 

Two boys were able to make it to the shore but the other two were not as lucky.

The witnesses were able to pull out Benjamin, who was unconscious.  

A bystander said he handed his dog's leash to someone on shore then went in to grab Benjamin and take him safely to the shore.

Aikens wasn't pulled out until an hour later by rescue crews wearing special water vision goggles and when they found him he was under cardiac arrest. 

'You couldn't even see your hand in your face,' said Lt. Norman Simpkins, Arubutus VFC. 

'Our swift water team was able to get out and start poking around with tools that we have on our units to try to find or see if we can feel for at the bottom of a pond what may have been the body.'

Fire fighters said that this boy's death exemplifies why walking on frozen ponds are never safe because while they may appear to be solid the ice may be very thin and susceptible to breaking.
