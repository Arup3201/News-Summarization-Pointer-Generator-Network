Four of the eight circus performers injured last month after a platform collapsed during an aerial hair-hanging stunt made their first public appearance on Tuesday to reveal the mental and physical effects of the fall.

At an emotional press conference the four women revealed they are to sue the Ringling Bros. and Barnum & Bailey Circus for the 40-feet fall and revealed they are plagued by flashbacks of the horrifying incident.

'We have nightmares about this,' said Svitlana Balanchieva, 22, one of the girls badly hurt in the May 4 accident in Providence, Rhode Island, which unfolded in front of nearly 4,000 parents and their shocked children.

The four girls said that they are planning their lawsuit and  are coming to terms with the idea their lives might never be the same, they said Tuesday from the hospital where they're recovering.

'My dream was to be a star performer,' Julissa Segrera, a 20-year-old American, said from her wheelchair. 'Now my dream is to get up and walk.'

A total of eight acrobats from the US, Brazil, Bulgaria and Ukraine were injured May 4 when investigators say a carabiner clip snapped, sending them plummeting about 20 feet to the floor at the Ringling Bros. and Barnum & Bailey Circus show in Providence, Rhode Island.

Four of the women spoke Tuesday at a news conference at Spaulding Rehabilitation Hospital in Boston, where a number are still undergoing physical therapy. For some, it was their first public appearance since the accident.

They declined to detail the extent of their individual injuries, citing the potential legal action, but their lawyers said the performers had collectively experienced about two dozen surgeries.

Viktoriya Medeiros, 34, of Bulgaria, who designed the hair-hanging "human chandelier" act with her husband, said the women know they are lucky to be alive.

'We are all terribly injured. Some of us require many surgeries,' she said, wearing a neck brace and seated in a wheelchair.

'We are learning to use our arms, hands and necks again (in) hours and hours of daily physical therapy. We are hoping we can (heal) enough that we can live our lives without this pain.'

Dayana Costa, a 26-year-old from Brazil, said her family put their lives on hold to be with her during the long recovery. She wore a neck brace, had pins in her arms and was in a motorized chair.

'I don't know what I'd do without them,' Costa said through tears.

Clifford Law Offices in Chicago is representing seven of the eight women injured in the accident, including the four that spoke Tuesday. The eighth is being represented by another firm.

The lawyers declined to say who would be the focus of a lawsuit and did not rule out pursuing legal action against the carabiner-maker or even the venue, the Dunkin' Donuts Center.

Attorney Michael Krzak said the women want to get to the 'root cause' of the accident, as it affects a number of aerial acts.

'They want to make sure this never happens again in another circus act,' he said.

Investigators from the Occupational Safety and Health Administration in Rhode Island are also probing the accident.

The women's medical treatment is being covered through workers compensation, Krzak said.

Balanchieva and fellow acrobat Viktoria Medeiros said they missed performing.

'We always liked it to entertain families and mostly small kids,' said Balanchieva, who wore a neck brace and support around her torso.

'We took great joy in making others happy,' Medeiros said. 'That will no longer come to be,' said Medeiros, seated in a wheelchair with her arm bandaged.

'Always it will make us sad to know that we will never go back to do what we want to do, what we love to do."

Providence Public Safety Commissioner Steven Pare stopped short last month of saying the carabiner caused Sunday's accident at the Ringling Bros. and Barnum and Bailey circus, witnessed by about 3,900 people, many of them children.

Serious injuries: As many as 20 performers were hurt when the scaffolding collapsed, dropping them between 25 and 40 feet (8 and 12 meters) to the ground

The federal Occupational Safety and Health Administration is trying to make a final determination.

'We don't know if it was metal fatigue, if it wasn't properly positioned or something else,' Pare said. 'We just don't know.'

All eight of the acrobats were still hospitalized with injuries including a pierced liver and neck and back fractures, as well as head injuries.

None of the injuries were life-threatening, said Stephen Payne, a spokesman for Feld Entertainment, Ringling's parent company said in the immediate aftermath.

Smart phone footage captured by a member of the audience shows a curtain fall to reveal a platform from which the performers were suspended, then suddenly the platform crashes to the ground and a loud gasp of horror can be heard from the audience.

Eleven people were admitted to hospital after the platform collapsed during an aerial hair-hanging stunt, sending eight acrobats plummeting to the ground

Sydney Bragg, 14, of North Kingstown, said the platform began to fall as it neared the rafters of the arena. At first, she said, she thought it was part of the act.

‘It just went crashing down,’ Sydney said. ‘Everyone was freaking out. We heard this huge clatter and then we just heard the girls scream.’

She said spotlights were on the performers at the time, but all the lights went out after the fall.

Rosa Viveiros of Seekonk, Massachusetts, said the act was covered by a curtain.

Shortly after the curtain was pulled away, she said, the performers fell on top of at least one other performer, a man who stood up with his face bloodied. The other performers remained still, she said.

‘We thought it was part of the circus,’ said Rosa Viveiros' husband, Joe.
