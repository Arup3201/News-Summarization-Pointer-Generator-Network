Controversial: Emma Hadley, executive principal at the school, has defended the decision to use taxpayers' money to fund the trip

There was a time when a school trip involved an outing to a castle or a museum to mark the end of the academic year.

But one school is spending £32,000 to
send 40 pupils and six teachers a little further afield next month – on
an all-expenses-paid trip to New York.

Skegness Academy said the lucky 
pupils were selected on the basis of attendance records, study records 
and attitude – and an application letter outlining how the trip could 
‘support the subjects they are studying’.

But the four-day, taxpayer-funded 
‘holiday’ was criticised by teaching unions and a local councillor 
yesterday, who accused the Lincolnshire academy of using the expedition 
to make the school more attractive to prospective pupils and their 
parents.

The academy defended the trip as an 
opportunity to broaden the horizons of pupils who may otherwise be 
unable to afford to visit the American city.

Ian Stephenson, of the National Union
of Teachers, said the cost of the trip could pay the annual salary of 
an extra teacher at the academy, rated ‘good’ by Ofsted.

Lincolnshire councillor Mark Smith, 
who is a governor at Skegness Grammar School, said: ‘The academy, by 
giving holiday rewards and free uniforms, is trying to increase its 
numbers at the expense of neighbouring schools, not just in Skegness but
the wider area.’

The lucky pupils, who will have their 
flights and accommodation paid for, were specially selected after 
submitting written applications to the school stating why they should be
given a place on next month’s trip.

The
decision has been attacked by the National Union of Teachers who say 
the money could have funded an extra teacher at the school.

NUT regional secretary Ian Stephenson 
said: 'It throws up issues about access to education and value for 
money.

'This is a great opportunity for some children but it means other 
children will miss out. The money being spent could easily fund another 
teacher.

'Schools are now very competitive and I 
can understand how schools would see these trips as a high profile event
which may attract pupils in a very competitive environment.

'It is an issue about taxpayers money. The amount that is being spent on a number of pupils going to New York could be spent on another teacher.'

Emma Hadley, executive principal, has 
defended the decision to use taxpayers’ money to fund a select group of 
pupils to go on the trip.

She said: 'We think it is a once in a 
lifetime transatlantic experience. We believe this is value for money as
a learning experience.

New York: A far more glamorous school trip than the traditional excursions to castles and historic monuments. But 40 pupils at an academy school will visit the Big Apple free of charge at a cost of £32,000 to the taxpayer

'It links very, very closely to their sixth form studies. We have students who will be looking at architecture, art, music, terrorism and politics while they are in New York.

'We believe it really will enhance and enliven their learning.

'Our
money comes directly from the Government and because of the way 
Greenwood Dale Foundation Trust operate there are economies and 
efficiencies of scale.'

The school, which has 1,190 pupils, became an Academy in 2010.

It is part of the Greenwood Dale Foundation Trust which sponsors 13 
secondary and primary schools across the East Midlands. The Skegness 
site is currently undergoing a £20 million rebuilding project.

The Academy was rated as good in an Ofsted inspection in October with its leadership and management described as 'outstanding'.

GCSE
and A level results have improved since it became an Academy despite 
the fact that it is in an area of selective education with the cream of 
the pupils going to the nearby Skegness Grammar School.

The Ofsted report said: 'The academy offers students an excellent range of enrichment activities to broaden their horizons.

'The sixth form is good. This represents an impressive improvement in teaching and achievement since it opened two years ago. The pass rate is 100% in nearly all subjects at A and AS level. This represents a significant improvement on the results in 2011.

'All the students who left the sixth form in July 2012 have embarked on further training, education or employment.'

Parents have not been asked to contribute to the cost of the trip.

It is thought the travel company may have an arrangement with helping out the cost of the teachers.

Greenwood Dale Foundation Trust said 
in a statement: 'Next month (6-10 February 2013) a group of 40 sixth form pupils 
(a mixture of year 12 and 13) from the Skegness Academy will be taking 
the trip of a lifetime to New York.

'Pupils wishing to go on the trip had 
to submit a letter of application to the Head of Sixth Form.

'Pupils had 
to highlight a specific area of interest and demonstrate how the trip 
would support the subjects that they are studying. For example, a pupil 
on the media studies course is keen to explore America’s film industry 
and a pupil studying sport is keen to research America’s sporting 
history. In addition, a number of other criteria were applied such as 
attendance, attitude and whether the pupil was up to date with their 
studies.

'On their return the pupils will write a piece about their chosen topic 
which will be formally assessed.

'Pupils are covering a range of topics 
covering sport, music, photography, tourism and fashion. 
The pieces of writing will then be showcased at a celebration evening 
for parents along with photographs and films that the pupils took during
the trip.

'The Greenwood Dale Foundation Trust only works in areas of social and 
economic disadvantage and often pays for pupils to go on trips that they
would not normally be able to afford to broaden their experiences and 
to enhance their studies.'
