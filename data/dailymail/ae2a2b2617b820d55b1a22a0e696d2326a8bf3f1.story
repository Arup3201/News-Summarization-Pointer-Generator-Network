Mail readers have raised more than £13,000 to help Sophie Thomlinson take her first steps

Daily Mail readers have raised more than £13,000 towards surgery to help a two-year-old disabled girl take her first steps.

Sophie Thomlinson was born prematurely and has spastic diplegia, a form of cerebral palsy which means she cannot use her legs.

An operation on her spine would enable her to walk, but she was denied NHS funding meaning her family was faced with raising the £25,000 cost themselves.

After Sophie’s plight was featured in yesterday’s Mail, generous donations from readers mean the family now have more than half their target. One donor, John Marlow, wrote on their online fundraising page: ‘Moved to tears by the Daily Mail article – often think the people in charge of funding get their priorities wrong.’

Sophie’s mother Allison, 40, thanked readers for their kindness and said the amount donated was ‘mind-blowing’.

Mrs Thomlinson said: ‘I was angry, upset and frustrated at how cosmetic surgery can be available on the NHS yet a procedure to help Sophie and improve her life isn’t. It is a child’s right to be able to walk.

‘The money raised so far is overwhelming, I keep thinking I’m going to wake up from a dream.’ The toddler, from Dukinfield, Greater Manchester, had been referred to a specialist at Leeds General Infirmary who can carry out the selective dorsal rhizotomy  (SDR) procedure.

But the hospital was not granted funding by commissioning body NHS England, meaning she could have surgery only if it was paid for privately.

Last year another hospital within the same Leeds Teaching Hospitals NHS Trust granted breast enhancement surgery to aspiring model Josie Cunningham at taxpayers’ expense, as she said her flat chest was ‘ruining her life’.

NHS England policy states SDR is ‘not routinely funded’, although guidelines from rationing body NICE state it should be ‘considered’ for children with spastic diplegia.

The policy is under review and campaigners fear a cost-saving decision could be made to remove funding entirely.

Cerebral palsy charities last night condemned the NHS for funding procedures like £15,000 gastric band operations and Miss Cunningham’s £4,800 breast implants, but not SDR surgery. Stars Foundation, a cerebral palsy charity established by Dame Vera Lynn, said it was asked for help ‘all the time’ by families whose NHS funding for SDR surgery had been withdrawn.

Trustee Diana Beeny said: ‘I appreciate the NHS hasn’t got funding for everything.

‘But perhaps the people who are prioritising these operations haven’t got it right.’

Between 155 and 258 children a year with cerebral palsy could be considered for SDR surgery. In many cases their families have to raise money to have the procedure performed here or in the US, after being turned down for NHS funding.

A spokesman for NHS England said: ‘We understand how difficult this is and sympathise with the family who feel they may benefit from this treatment. However the current evidence base does not yet demonstrate sufficient effectiveness for its routine use and we need to be assured of this.’
