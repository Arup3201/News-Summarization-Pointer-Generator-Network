One of the most bizarre decisions of the season so far occurred in Belgium on Saturday afternoon between Genk and Kortrijk.

The visitors were denied a seemingly perfectly legitimate goal inside the opening 15 minutes, with referee Nicolas Laforge deeming the ball had gone out of play before re-entering the field and ending up in the back of the net - ruling out the effort.

The Kortrijk players were left flabbergasted at the decision, expressing their disbelief at Laforge - who instead awarded a corner.

Quite how Laforge came to the decision of awarding a corner was particularly baffling, with the ball clearly remaining in play throughout the period. 

It would prove extremely costly for the visitors who eventually fell to a 3-0 defeat against their title rivals.

And to compound matters Genk leapfrogged Kortrijk in the process, moving up to second in the Pro League just three points off the leaders Club Brugge.
