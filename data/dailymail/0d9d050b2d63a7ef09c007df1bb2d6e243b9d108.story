Brendan Rodgers has described Manchester City midfielder James Milner as 'outstanding' but refused to comment on whether Liverpool would make a move for him.

Milner's contract with the Premier League champions expires at the end of June, meaning he is now able to speak to other clubs about signing a pre-contract arrangement.

Rodgers is just one of the managers interested in the in-form 29-year-old, and although he admitted he was a big admirer he didn't want to go into any further detail out of respect for City.

Rodgers said he did not want to discuss other clubs' players until they were certain to sign for Liverpool

'James is a wonderful player,' Rodgers told a press conference. 'He's been an outstanding footballer since the time I saw him at Leeds as a young player. 

'Players get linked with this club consistently - whether it's through agents or representatives trying to, by virtue of association, get a better deal at another club or get something by other means.

'I would never speak about another player until they were signed and in the door. You could probably fire a whole list of names at me and you would get the same response.' 

Regardless of Rodgers' bashful attitude his club are under huge pressure to find a replacement for the LA Galaxy-bound Steven Gerrard, who will end his 18-year stay at the club at the end of the season.
