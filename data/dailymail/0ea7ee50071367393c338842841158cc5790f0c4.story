Britain's aid spending increased by more than any other European country last year.

The budget rose by 28 per cent, allowing the UK to hit its target of spending 0.7 per cent of GDP on overseas development.

It means it has retained its place as second only to the United States in terms of the size of its development budget.

Rise: Britain spent £10.6billion on overseas aid in 2013 - up from £8.3billion the year before

The figures, collated by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, show Britain spent £10.6billion on overseas aid in 2013 – up from £8.3billion the year before.

The total is second only to the US, which spent £18.9billion, but that represents just 0.19 per cent of its GDP.

It is a mark of success for the UK, coming ahead of Germany, France and Russia in the league tables

Germany spent only 0.38 per cent, France 0.41 per cent and Russia 0.03 per cent.

The OECD said it was alarmed that spending in sub-Saharan Africa had fallen by 4 per cent, while states such as China and India would enjoy year-on-year increases until 2017, often in the form of soft loans.

Many Conservative backbenchers are incensed that the Coalition has protected aid spending at a time when public  services are facing stringent cuts.
