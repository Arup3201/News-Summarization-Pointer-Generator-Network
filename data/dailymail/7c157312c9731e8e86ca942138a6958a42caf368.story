Lawsuit: John Travolta, pictured with wife Kelly Preston, is facing accusations of inappropriate sexual behaviour towards a SECOND male massage therapist

John Travolta has proof that he wasn't in Los Angeles on the day he was accused of sexually harassing a male masseur, it has emerged

The Pulp Fiction actor, who has described the claim as 'baseless', was photographed in New York on January 16th - the day the incident is alleged to have taken place in LA.

As well as being photographed in New York, TMZ.com has
also obtained a receipt from Mr Chow's restaurant in the city, proving 
that Travolta dined in the eatery and paid a bill of $382.69 for the 
meal, as well as a $100 tip.

In a statement, a spokesman for the 58-year-old actor, who fully denies the initial sexual battery lawsuit, said: 'This lawsuit is a complete fiction 
and fabrication. None of the events claimed in the suit ever occurred.

'The plaintiff, who refuses to give their name, knows that the suit is a 
baseless lie. It is for that reason that the plaintiff hasn't been 
identified with a name, even though it is required to do so.

'On
the date when plaintiff claims John met him, John was not in 
California, and it can be proved that he was on the East Coast. 
Plaintiff's attorney has filed this suit to try and get his 15 minutes 
of fame. John intends to get this case thrown out, and then he will sue 
the attorney and Plaintiff for malicious prosecution.'

The proof that Travolta was not in Los Angeles at the time of the alleged incident comes as a second male masseur came forward to accuse the actor of alleged sexual harassment, seeking $2million in damages.

Happily married: Travolta with wife Kelly on 
April 25th as they left Barbra Streisand's 70th birthday party and two 
days before the first alleged incident on January 16th, they appeared at the 
G'Day LA event

According to RadarOnline,
the second accuser claims to have 'substantial documentation and 
numerous witnesses regarding the substance of Travolta's actions.'

However, Travolta's lawyer Marty Singer has branded the accusation just 'as absurd and ridiculous as the first one'.

Singer also revealed he will take legal action - not only 
against the claimant, but also the claimant's lawyer - for malicious 
prosecution.

Denial: Travolta, on the set of his latest film Savages in LA last year, will fight the case, according to his lawyer

He told The 
Hollywood Reporter: 'There is a heightened standard for a lawyer suing a
celebrity and knowing the media will pick it up. The lawyer can't just 
rely on the client. He needs to do an investigation and has an 
obligation to do due diligence.'

Whispers about John Travolta’s sexuality have plagued his movie career almost from the outset.

Various camp roles in films – most notably as a drag queen in the musical Hairspray – have helped fuel rumours he is secretly gay.

But there have also been strongly denied accusations he has been living a double life strikingly at odds with his family man image.

They include rumours that his 1991 marriage to Kelly Preston was arranged by the shadowy cult-like religion of Scientology, of which he is a leading disciple.

Seven years later, the father-of-two Travolta was named as a homosexual in court papers by a former member of the Church. The case never got a hearing, however.

And in 2001, Travolta faced unsubstantiated claims that he had tried to pick up a business executive in a health club.

However, the rumour mill reached a crescendo in 2006, when the actor was seen apparently kissing a male friend as he prepared to board his own Boeing 707 jet in Canada.

Travolta has always maintained he is not worried by rumours surrounding his sexuality, insisting 'I don't think anyone can hurt me.'

According to the lawsuit, which was 
filed on Tuesday morning in Federal Court in Los Angeles, the second victim
alleges that while working at an unspecified resort in Atlanta, Georgia
on January 28, 2012, he did an in-room massage on Travolta.

According 
to the documents, Travolta was staying on the 15th floor of the high-end resort, and he was referred to as Mr. White.

The documents claim that the plaintiff 'doesn't 
normally do in-room massages and asked a co-worker to take the 
assignment, but he declined because Travolta has been banned from a spa
that the coworker used to work at in Los Angeles.'

On the morning of the massage 
Travolta is said to have had 'a strange demeanour, bloodshot eyes and climbed onto the 
already setup massage table'.

The lawsuit continues: 'Travolta removed the entire sheet from his
body, and he claimed the sheets were sticky and could not tolerate the 
heat. Travolta further indicated that he likes a lot of "Glutes" work 
meaning a massage on his buttocks.'

The plaintiff also alleges that 
Travolta began masturbating after attempting to get him to touch his 
'scrotum, upper thighs and buttocks'.

In the first incident, Travolta allegedly claimed that he got his 
first big movie break due to the sexual favours he performed while 
starring in the 1975 TV series Welcome Back Kotter.

The plaintiff, or accuser - who refuses to be named because his
lawyer claims he is frightened of the Hollywood powerhouse - alleges 
that Mr Travolta picked him up in his black Lexus SUV after a anonymous phone 
appointment was made instructing the masseur to wait in a specific spot 
in a nearby street.

'Fiction' A spokesperson for Travolta has hit out at the claims, even claiming that Travolta was not in LA at the time - though he was pictured at a G'Day LA event with his wife two days earlier

Witness:The plaintiff recalls a chef cooking burgers present for the first half of the massage, which passed without incident

Serious allegations: Travolta is absolutely refuting that he was even in LA at the time of the alleged incident

During the journey, the man noticed condoms alongside chocolate cake wrappers littering the console of the vehicle,

After pulling up outside the Beverley
Hills Hotel, they are then said to have entered one of the business's 
annexes opposite the main building, which are known as bungalows.

They were then greeted by an 
'overweight' black man who was grilling hamburgers. This chef is then 
said to have disappeared when Mr Travolta allegedly tried to have sex 
with the male masseur. The masseur is seeking more than $2million in damages.

Okorie Okorcha, the lawyer representing the first masseur told RadarOnline.com: 'My client is afraid of John Travolta.

He added: 'Mr. Travolta made very explicit threats against my client, which are contained in the lawsuit.

'Specifically, John Travolta told my client that Hollywood is controlled by homosexual Jewish men who expect favors in return for sexual activity.

'Let's face it, John Travolta is an extremely powerful man, and my client absolutely felt threatened by Mr. Travolta. My client was sexually assaulted by Mr. Travolta and he needs to be held accountable for his actions.'
