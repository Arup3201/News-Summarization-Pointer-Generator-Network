A thief stole £3,000 of cigarettes – by breaking into an open prison.

The culprit or culprits slipped through a skylight then removed a ceiling tile to get into a store at HMP Hollesley Bay, Suffolk.

The jail has been notoriously nicknamed Holiday Bay by inmates after dozens of them ran away and disappeared in previous years.

In the latest episode, the stock of tobacco was stolen from the prison's main storeroom in a late-night raid before it could be sold to convicts.

Police hunting the culprits are understood to have found a shoe print near the scene.

The tobacco was taken between 4.30pm on Monday, June 16 and 8am on Tuesday, June 17.

Suffolk Police said up to 300 packets were taken.

A Hollesley Bay spokesman said: 'Earlier this month a quantity of tobacco products was stolen from HMP Hollesley Bay.

'This is now a matter for the police.

'Such items are purchased by prisoners using their own money.'

Last year thieves stole tobacco worth around £25,000 during raids in April and October at Leyhill Prison, near Bristol.
