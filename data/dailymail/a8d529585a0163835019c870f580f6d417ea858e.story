Nigel Clough is still working his magic in England’s most famous cup competition - thanks to an Italian teenager.

Diego De Girolamo, 19, dug the Sheffield United boss out of a hole after his much-changed team were on the brink of being dumped out by Preston.

Preston were better for much of the first half and took a deserved lead through Paul Gallagher’s vicious free-kick.

But Clough’s team responded well after the break and got themselves back into the tie when De Girolamo scored from close range after good work from substitute Jamie Murphy.

United have earned themselves a reputation as knockout specialists in the past two seasons and arrived at Deepdale having lost just two of 18 FA and League Cup matches under Clough.

Clough puts his team’s success in the cups down to the face that he fields his strongest side and every opportunity but he broke his own rule here by making eight changes to his starting line-up.

That was perhaps forgivable, given the fact that this tie fell between the two legs of the League Cup semi-final against Tottenham, added to the fact the Blades are pushing for promotion from League One.

During his time as Leicester City manager, Sven-Goran Eriksson claimed Gallagher’s free-kicks were as good as David Beckham’s and it looked like the former England manger had a point as Preston took the lead.

Chris Basham’s clumsy challenge 35 yards from goal gave the hosts a shooting chance and Gallagher delivered, sending his vicious shot dipping over the wall and giving Mark Howard no chance.

As well as making eight changes, Sheffield United also adopted an unfamiliar 3-5-2 shape and the players were clearly struggling to cope with the disruption. Ben Davies’ free-kick, dragged horribly wide, was as close as the visitors came to troubling Thorsten Stuckmann, Preston’s German goalkeeper.

The visitors were fortunate not to fall further behind in the opening stages of the second half when Kyel Reid, the Preston winger, seized upon some sloppy defending and shot at Howard, with the visiting goalkeeper gathering the ball at the second attempt.

United finally found some rhythm and De Girolamo fashioned their first genuine chance.

The he got to the ball ahead of Stuckmann and poked his effort towards the empty net, only to see defender Calum Woods recover and hook the ball away from the goal.

The introduction of Jamie Murphy helped the visitors keep the pressure on and he played a key role for the equaliser, making progress down the left before cutting the ball back for De Girolamo to score from inside the six-yard box.
