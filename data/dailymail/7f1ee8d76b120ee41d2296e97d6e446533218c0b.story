Ministers will not try to water down the hunting ban before the election, David Cameron said yesterday.

The Prime Minister said opposition from the Liberal Democrats meant a compromise plan to make it easier for hill farmers to control foxes had been dropped.

Mr Cameron said the decision was a matter of ‘regret’, and Downing Street insisted it remained committed to giving MPs a free vote on repealing the hunt ban ‘when time allows’.

Ministers have ruled out plans to water down the ban on fox hunting before the next election

But Tory MPs warned the decision would dismay many traditional supporters in the countryside, and could even cost the party seats at the next election.

Pro-hunting umbrella group Vote OK flooded Tory marginals with up to 15,000 volunteers at the last election in the hope of securing a majority in favour of repealing Labour’s ban. Many also campaigned at the 2005 election and at subsequent by-elections.

Tory MP Simon Hart said there was now little prospect of the party attracting similar grassroots support at next year’s General Election.

Mr Hart, a former chief executive of the Countryside Alliance, said: ‘We need these people. You can have the slickest leaflets in the world but you still need people to go out and deliver them on a wet Wednesday night, and that is something all the parties are struggling with.

‘David Cameron is aware of that, and people recognise he is sympathetic, but the facts of coalition mean he does not have much room for manoeuvre.

‘It will unquestionably have an effect next year in some marginal seats. Those people in rural seats who lose by less than 2,000 votes will be left wondering what might have been if we had been able to do more on hunting.’

But one senior figure in the hunting community said supporters felt betrayed by the lack of Government action on hunting.

‘Our people have had a bellyful,’ he said. ‘We’ve had lots of sympathy and warm words from ministers, but they haven’t actually lifted a finger to help us.’

David Cameron has been pressured into ruling out changes by the Lib Dems, but pro-hunting MP Simon Hart fears the lack of action on the issue could cost the Conservatives at the next election

Ministers had been considering a call by Welsh hill farmers to relax the hunting ban to help them control foxes.

The change would have allowed farmers to use a pack of dogs to flush a fox from cover before shooting it.

A recent study found that the current limit of using two dogs is ineffective and means foxes are chased for longer.

But the move would require a vote in parliament and the support of both governing parties.

Critics of the plan said it amounted to a lifting of the hunting ban by the back door.

Mr Cameron yesterday told MPs the proposal ‘has been received and is being considered but I regret to say I don’t think there’ll be Government agreement to go forward’.

The Department of the Environment, Food and Rural Affairs is expected to launch a consultation on the proposals in the coming months, but there is now no prospect of the change being brought in before the election.

Hunt opponents welcomed Mr Cameron’s climbdown. Joe Duckworth, chief executive of the League Against Cruel Sports, said: ‘I am delighted that we have flushed out this back door attack on the Hunting Act.

'What they planned would have driven a coach and horses through the Act. I am delighted we have thwarted this plot from a tiny but powerful hunting lobby.’
