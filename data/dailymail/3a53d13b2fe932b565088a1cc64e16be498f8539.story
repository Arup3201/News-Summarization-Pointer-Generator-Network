Asbo: Anisha Mitchell, 41, is not allowed to go into the playground after repeatedly abusing other parents

A mother-of-three has been given an Asbo banning her from dropping off and collecting her children from school after more than 100 anti-social outbursts.

Anisha Mitchell, 41, is not allowed to go into the playground after repeatedly abusing other parents.

She has been banned from going near St Mary's Infant and Junior Schools or Cleeve Secondary School in Cheltenham, Gloucestershire, for the next five years.

In total, 31 people had reported her to police and the council, Cheltenham Magistrates' Court was told.

The mother has also been ordered not to cause distress to her neighbours under the Asbo.

Mrs Mitchell and her husband Benjamin had
 previously had an Asbo imposed in West Sussex at the request of Crawley
 Borough Council.

The new Asbo, granted on Monday this 
week, prevents her from entering the schools' grounds between 6am and 
6.15pm from Monday to Fridays, unless in the case of a 'genuine 
emergency'.

One neighbour said Mrs Mitchell had been a problem since moving into the area.

'She has fallen out with several residents and there have been some quite nasty incidents,' she said.

'She
 is a bully and she seems to pick on the more vulnerable people. Any 
attempts to be neighbourly towards her have been completely thrown back 
in our faces. Whatever happens we want to have peace on the street 
again.'

But Mrs Mitchell insisted she was the victim and that she was being picked on.

She said problems first started when she trimmed the hedge separating her house and the next door neighbours.

'There are only about five or six people who have problems with me,' she said.

'I am the victim here. In this court of law, the more people who say the same thing, the more leverage they have.

'It has caused a lot of problems for my husband and for my children. They are trying to intimidate me and force me to move out.'

Trevor
 Gladding, community protection team leader at Cheltenham Borough 
Council, said: 'We decided to take civil action as the anti-social 
behaviour which has been going on for four years, was not acceptable and
 had to stop.'

He added: 'We hope the Asbo will bring peace of mind to the community and serve as a deterrent to others.'
