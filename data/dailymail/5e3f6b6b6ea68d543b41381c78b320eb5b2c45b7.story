For a player that has yet to regularly score at club level, Nicklas Bendtner certainly needs no invitation to where the back of the net is while wearing a Denmark shirt.

The former Arsenal striker became an outcast at the Gunners and is now struggling for game time at Wolfsburg.

But a hat-trick against the USA on Wednesday shows the striker has no problems at international level.

Here Sportsmail looks at the Dane's international scoring record as well as nine other hot-shots who have failed to replicate the form shown for their country at their clubs.

Ali Daei (International caps 149, goals 109)

Ali Daei is in a league of his own. As the top international goal scorer of all time he is the only player to net over 100 times for his country.

Daei was prolific for Iran and featured in the 1998 World Cup where he played against the USA (above)

But the striker found banging goals in for Iran was a lot easier than doing it on a weekly basis in Germany. Bayern Munich signed him in 1998 but within a year he was at Hertha Berlin, who offloaded him to Dubai in 2002 following just six league goals.

Stern John (Trinidad & Tobago - International caps 115, goals 70)

With an international strike rate better than Luis Suarez, Zlatan Ibrahimovic and Robin van Persie, you would hope a player as prolific as that on the global scene to at least make a splash in the Premier League.

England's John Terry clears the ball off the line in front of John and Rio Ferdinand during the Three Lions' 2-0 win over Trinidad & Tobago at the group stages of the 2006 World Cup

But Stern John never stood out during his two years at Birmingham between 2002 and 2004, while Sunderland also opted against giving him much of a chance in the top flight.

It certainly doesn't reflect well on the international opponents Trinidad & Tobago must have been playing.

Lukas Podolski (Germany - International caps 122, goals 48)

Since making his international debut over 11 years ago, Lukas Podolski has gone on to become a regular for Germany, winning over 120 caps and of course the World Cup last year.

Podolski has over 120 caps for Germany and took a selfie with Bastian Schweinsteiger after winning the 2014 World Cup in Brazil last summer following a 1-0 victory over Argentina in the final

His international breakthrough came while starring for Cologne but since moving to Bayern Munich in 2006, his club form never again hit the same consistent heights. 

A flop at Bayern and frozen out at Arsenal, he is now toiling on loan at Inter Milan from the Gunners.

Milan Baros (Czech Republic - International caps 93, goals 41)

Between 2002 and 2008, Milan Baros failed to establish himself as a Premier League striker following an average spell at Liverpool, a poor two years at Aston Villa and a very brief loan spell at Portsmouth.

Milan Baros was the top scorer at Euro 2004 as he celebrates one of his five goals against Latvia

Czech Republic reached the semi-finals thanks to Baros' two goals in a 3-0 quarter-final win over Denmark

So it was intriguing to see that during this period he was also the top scorer at Euro 2004, scoring five goals as Czech Republic reached the semi-finals. 

David Healy (Northern Ireland - International caps 95, goals 36)

Now David Healy wasn't a bad player, but for a striker that holds the record for the most goals in a European qualifying campaign  (13 for Euro 2008), you would have expected him to make more of his opportunity in the Premier League.

But just five league goals for Fulham and Sunderland between 2007 and 2011 indicated otherwise. Still, Northern Ireland fans will cherish the memory of his famous winner against England in 2005.

Nicklas Bendtner (Denmark - International caps 65, goals 29)

Much maligned during his Arsenal spell, and even loan spell at Sunderland and Juventus failed to land him permanent moves.

Even now at Wolfsburg, Bendtner can hardly get a kick. For Denmark though he is a totally different prospect. His hat-trick against USA on Wednesday reflects well on a record which has seen him score five goals more than he did in the league at Arsenal in 43 fewer games. 

Helder Postiga (Portugal - International caps 71, goals 27)

It seems incredible to think that a striker who couldn't even get into one of Tottenham's worst ever Premier League teams during the 2003-04 season is still mixing it with the likes of Cristiano Ronaldo at the highest level..

Helder Postiga scored his only league goal for Tottenham against Liverpool in January 2004

But Postiga would later haunt England after equalising against the Three Lions in a Euro 2004 quarter-final

Postiga scored just one league goal at Spurs, but he had the last laugh on England. Postiga scored for Portugal against the Three Lions in Euro 2004, while also featuring in the team that dumped out Sven Goran Eriksson's side at the World Cup two years later.

Jozy Altidore (USA - International caps 79, goals 27)

It was no surprise earlier in his career that not just Hull but Sunderland decided to bring the powerful looking forward to the Premier League.

But just one league goal in 42 appearances for the Black Cats though soon had the North East outfit packing him off to Toronto in a swap deal for Jermain Defoe.

Despite this, Altidore still holds his own in the starting XI of a respectable United States outfit.  

El Hadji Diouf (Senegal - International caps 69, goals 21) 

The star man of Senegal's 2002 World Cup campaign which helped him land African Footballer of the Year for the second year running after the tournament.

So it was seen as quite a coup for Liverpool when they signed the forward for £10m. Just three league goals in three years though saw his stock dramatically fall and despite holding down a place after joining Bolton, he never hit the same global stardom which earned him his high profile Reds move.

Danny Welbeck (England - International caps 32, goals 12)

Frustrated at a lack of playing time in his six years at Manchester United, Danny Welbeck is finding a similar problem now at Arsenal in that he cannot get a start as a striker in front of Olivier Giroud.

Welbeck has impressed when playing as a striker for England. Here he celebrates a goal against San Marino

Stick the 24-year-old in an England shirt though and he comes to life. His cheeky back heel against Sweden at Euro 2012 underlined his ability, and his recent addition to the side in partnering Wayne Rooney seems to have also improved the form of the England captain.
