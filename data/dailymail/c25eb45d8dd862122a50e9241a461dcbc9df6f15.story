This astonishing footage shows a 22-year-old paedophile emerging from a tent where he had raped a schoolgirl who he groomed online.

Sean Clode groomed the 14-year-old on the internet before persuading her to skip school and travel hundreds of miles from her home in Northern Scotland to see him.

He was jailed today for six years at Teeside Crown Court after the footage from a police helicopter caught him getting out of the tent and putting his trainers on while the girl pulled her dress down.

Caught: In helicopter footage of the search for a missing schoolgirl Clode is seen crouching outside of the tent where he had spent the night with his teenage victim

The court was shown the footage during his trial where Clode claimed the girl had arrived at Hartlepool without his knowledge and that they had not had sex

Secretive: Here Clode appears to be in conversation with someone onside the tent in other parts of the footage he is seen putting on his trainers while the school girl pulls down her dress

Judge Howard Crowson told jobless Clode, from Hartlepool, that age of consent laws were needed to protect vulnerable teenagers from men like him.

Sentencing him to jail he said: 'That she was a willing participant in these activities is no mitigation,' the judge added.

'Her life and outlook have been completely distorted by you.'

Judge Crowson said Clode could easily have cut the communication before things 
got so serious, and decided the defendant continued it 'for your own 
selfish motives.'

Vile: Clode groomed the schoolgirl online and persuaded her to runaway to see him in Hartlepool but told court that no sex took place between them

He said the plan for the pair to meet up caused 'unimaginable 
anxiety' for her parents, and described the father’s search for his 
daughter as 'desperate.'

The Judge added: 'Your intention was clearly to coerce her into sexual activity.

'This case demonstrates why the age of consent law is necessary to protect 14-year-old girls.

'You are a selfish man interested only in your own sexual desires.'

The court heard that the pair had rendezvoused at the railway station in Hartlepool five months ago and camped overnight on nearby dunes in a tent she had bought on her way down.

They had sex on at least two occasions during the night, despite him knowing she was underage.

She had pretended to her parents she was going to school before going on a sleep-over with a friend, but instead met up with Clode.

When it became apparent she had vanished, her frantic father drove through the night, first to Edinburgh, then on to the North East desperately searching for the teenager.

He asked postmen, knocked on doors and wandered the streets looking for her, having arrived at dawn.

It was only at 2.30pm that day that he finally heard she was safe.

The next day the girl told police in a recorded interview that she had sex several times that night with Clode in the tent.

But the following month she changed her story and said no sex had taken place in a bid to protect the man with whom she was still infatuated.

The judge concluded she was acting on his wishes by giving a false account.

Trying to hide: Clode was spotted by the tent which appeared to have been deliberately pitched in the shadow of some plants to make it more difficult to see

Shameless: The court heard the tent the pair slept in was purchased by the teenage girl on her way from northern Scotland to Hartlepool

The jury deliberated for just over an 
hour before convicting him of sexual grooming, child abduction and two 
counts of sexual activity with a child.

The abduction charge related to Clode removing the girl from the lawful authority of her parents.

Jailed: Clode has been sentenced to six years in prison after a judge branded him a 'selfish man interested only in your own sexual desires'

He
denied all offences, denying sex had taken place, and claiming the girl
arrived in Hartlepool without his knowledge and that he was merely 
trying to keep her safe.

The case has continued to drive a wedge between the girl, who cannot be identified, and her family.

Speaking
of a Victim Impact Statement made by the girl’s father, Anthony Dunne, 
prosecuting, said: 'It talks very strongly about the stress that was 
caused to the family by the daughter’s disappearance, by the difficulty 
that continues in their relationship with their daughter given her 
apparent sense of loyalty towards the defendant and what appears to be 
his continuing influence and control over her.'

Rebecca Brown, defending, said her 
client did not set out to groom the girl when they chanced upon each 
other while playing Xbox games online.

Clode was subject to a Sexual Offences Prevention Order, will sign the sex offenders register and may be barred from working with children.

After the case, the girl’s father said in a statement: 'We would like to thank Cleveland Police for their prompt and extensive search which found our daughter, for their work and effort made to bring her abductor to justice. Also for the understanding shown to the family at this difficult time.'

Outside court, Detective Constable Chris Bryan said: 'Parents should view this case as a warning to check who their children are speaking to, not only on social networking sites but also over live chat when playing on games consoles.

'Sexual predators will use any opportunity possible to groom victims.'
