A teenager who who ran away from his Florida home at the weekend was yesterday found dead after apparently shooting himself dead with a shotgun he found while robbing a neighbor's home.

Edgwater Police found the body of 16-year-old Matthew Sagram at the home of his neighbor in Wildwood, just two doors down from his home.

Police Chief Dave Arcieri said the gunshot wound to be self-inflicted and that the teenage had committed suicide.

The house where the teen was found, two doors from where he lived, had no connection either to the youngster.

Dead: Matthew Sagra, 16, shot himself with a gun that he found in the neighbors house he was in the middle of robbing

Captain Joe Mahoney said it was unclear why the teenager was in the house to begin with.

'We believe Matthew 
was committing a burglary in the residence,' Mahoney said. 'He didn’t 
have permission to be in the residence. He located a firearm, a handgun,
 inside the house.'

Investigators believe Mr Sagram broke 
into the home of Debra Lynn Cole on Wildwood Drive on Sunday afternoon 
as part of a burglary.

When police had entered the house after Ms. Cole arrived there Sunday they saw that a part of her home had been ransacked.

During the time the teenage was in the house, he came across the shotgun and took his own life.

Police say they do not believe the gun went off accidentally although it's not clear why the teen would have shot himself.

Mahoney said he could not discuss anything related to the boy’s mental status.

A
 missing person’s report was filed by the boy's mother, Brenda Sagram, 
on Saturday night indicates that the teen may have been somewhat 
troubled.

Suicide: The body of 16-year-old  Matthew Sagram was found in this Edgwater, Florida home. Police say he was in the middle of a burglary when he found a shotgun and took his own life

According to a missing person’s report 
that Brenda Sagram filed with police on Saturday evening though, Matthew
 asked his mother earlier that day if he could go to a friend’s house 
down the street

She told her son to be back by lunchtime. When 
he didn’t return, Mrs Sagram went to Matthew’s friend’s house and was 
told that her son never showed up

The mother told investigators that Matthew was on medications, but he had left those behind

Her son had not mad any statements about harming himself and she says he 'seemed fine when he left.

The boy also attended Riverview Learning Center, a school for children who have discipline issues.

Death: The body of a 16-year-old boy was found in a house along Wildwood Drive in Edgwater, Florida. It appears the teen shot himself with a gun. His body was found in house just two doors down from where he lived

What remain's a mystery is why Mr Sagram chose Ms. Cole's house.

The police chief said there is no known connection between Matthew, his family and Cole.

Upon arriving home and realizing the home had been disturbed, Ms Cole says she did not go into any of the other rooms and instead left her residence calling 911.

When officers went inside to check Cole’s house, they found the boy’s body. Police have not released the teen’s name.

'It appears that he shot himself but this is an ongoing investigation,' Arcieri said.

The youngster’s family lives two houses away from Cole’s residence, but there do not appear to be any ties to Cole.
