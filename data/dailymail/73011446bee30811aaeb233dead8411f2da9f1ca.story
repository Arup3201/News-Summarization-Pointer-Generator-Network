Rafaele Sollecito appears to be morphing into Amanda Knox - the woman who helped him murder his ex-girlfriend - as the duo prepare for yet another appeal against their convictions.

Sollecito was re-convicted along with his former lover, U.S citizen Knox, of killing his former partner Brit, Meredith Kercher, in November 2007. 

The pair's appeal against those convictions will now take place next month, a year after they were found guilty over the death for a second time. 

It seems unlikely Knox, who now lives in the U.S, will ever be returned to jail for the crime as she has repeatedly refused to return to Italy. If she is convicted again, Italy is likely to request to extradite her but her longstanding battle to prove her innocence has made her a cause célèbre in the U.S who may ignore political pressure to send her back. Sollectio on the other hand has no cards to play. He remains in Italy and authorities have his passport.

Sollecito appeared on Italian TV State Rai1 where he again maintained his innocence over the 2007 murder

Ahead of the appeal, Sollecito appeared on Italian TV State Rai1, and with his long-flowing chestnut-colored hair he looked very similar to his co-offender.

He again maintained his innocence, saying: 'If we look at the facts objectively, we'll see officers made several mistakes. Investigators never went further in looking at many things.

'I still cannot believe I might go to prison for something I did not do. I have suffered threats and pressures by investigators. They locked me in a room for 15 hours and questioned me for a long time, threatening that I would not be allowed out of prison.' 

Sellecito said 'I can still not shake off this sword of Damocles', and also said he believes '100 per cent' that Knox did not kill Kercher. 

Sollecito was sentenced to 25 years in jail by the Appeal Court in the northern city of Florence and Knox received 28 years. 

Sollecito and Knox were first found guilty of murder in November 2009.

The killers' convictions were later quashed after experts said forensic evidence had been contaminated and they were released. Prosecutors then appealed that finding and the case was re-tried in March 2013. 

In January last year a court upheld the original verdict, but the pair remained at large as under Italy's legal system, any verdict reached after a second appeal but be ratified by the highest court. 

Sollecito told the show that he could not 'shake off this sword of Damocles' and said he could not believe that he could be sent to jail having 'not done anything'; he also said he believed Knox was '100 per cent' innocent

Kercher, 21 (seen above in handout pictures from her family) was found dead on the floor of her bedroom in November 2007; some of her belongings were missing and Knox reported an apparent burglary to police

Since the last verdict, Sollecito, 30, has stayed in Italy. He was ordered to remain there after being found near the Italian border with Slovenia and Austria hours after being found guilty for the second time. He has since completed a degree in information technology.

Knox, now 27, lives in West Seattle and works as a freelance reporter. She has completed a degree in creative writing. 

Kercher, 21, was found dead on the floor of her bedroom. Some of her belongings were missing and Knox reported an apparent burglary to police. 

Detectives concluded the supposed break-in looked staged and Knox became the prime suspect. 

She then implicated Patrick Lumumba, a bar owner she worked for. The duo were arrested along with Sollecito. Mr Lumumba was later released when evidence pointed to Rudy Guede's involvement. 

Guede was then accused of committing the murder along with Sollecito and Knox. In October 2008 he was found guilty of sexually assaulting and murdering Kercher.
