Nigella Lawson has received an apology letter from New Zealand immigration officials after they mistakenly thought she had been barred from the US because of her self-confessed drug use.

The celebrity chef, who last year admitted to previously taking cocaine and cannabis, flew to New Zealand on May 3 for a promotional tour for Whittaker's chocolate.

Before the 54-year-old arrived at Auckland Airport she was initially granted a 'special direction' visa to work in NZ.

But officials have now admitted the waiver, which was issued in April, was not needed as there was no evidence she had been banned from entering the US.

'We're sorry': Nigella Lawson flew to Auckland airport in New Zealand, in May, on a visa waiver

In a letter, obtained by the MailOnline, Immigration New Zealand area manager Michael Carley said: 'We regret any inconvenience caused to your client and I hope this letter clarifies that your client is not considered to be an excluded person by Immigration New Zealand.'

He explained that Immigration New Zealand previously believed Nigella's immigration status was 'inconclusive' so they had granted a 'special direction' visa to speed things along.

A spokeswoman for Immigration New Zealand said the department ‘was aware of issues reported in the media about [Lawson’s] inability to travel to the United States’ when they were assessing her visa application.

Nigella has no drug convictions so she is not legally barred from any country.

Nigella Lawson's lawyer in New Zealand Megan Richards told MailOnline: 'The only comment we want to make was everyone was very happy with the outcome and how everything turned out.'

When asked how Nigella came to be considered an excluded person in the first place, Ms Richards said: 'I guess there were various media reports and I guess there was speculation about what may or may not have occurred.

'They've cleared up the position with their statement to us so that shouldn't be in doubt anymore.

'They looked at all the information they had and decided that perhaps that wasn't the case which they may have thought it was initially.'

In the US, officials ask people who apply for a visa if they have ever been arrested or convicted in relation to illegal drugs.

They can then decide to prevent entry to the country even if the person involved was never charged.

However, Nigella was never arrested, and British police said in January that she would not face any police action over her admission of drug-taking, in part out of fears that charging her would deter other court witnesses from telling the truth.

Reports that she had been banned from the US came after she tried to catch a British Airways flight to Los Angeles on April 2 but appeared to be turned away by officials.
