Martin Pickering was bitten on the chest by a bus driver after he got into a row over the cost of the ticket as he travelled with his two young daughters

A father-of-two was left scarred after he boarded a bus with his two young daughters and the driver bit him as they argued about the price of the journey.

Martin Pickering, 38, attempted to take a photo of the driver of the Arriva bus in Derby he had boarded after he refused to give him his name when Mr Pickering questioned him about the price of the journey for himself and his daughters, aged six and eight.

But the driver was clearly angered by Mr Pickering's attempts to take a photograph and lunged at him, sinking his teeth into his chest. 

Mr Pickering, who is 6ft 10ins tall, said: 'When you get on a bus you don't expect you to end up being someone's lunch.

'I mean, who bites people? I was so taken aback. I couldn't believe it had happened.' 

The driver of the double decker bus has been cautioned by police and Mr Pickering has been awarded an out of court settlement.  

Mr Pickering was travelling back from a day out in Derby with his daughters,to his home on the outskirts of the city.

He claims the driver on the number 45 bus charged him around £1.50 more for the outbound journey than he paid for the tickets on the way into the city.

Mr Pickering sent his daughters to sit on the top deck and then claimed he attempted to reason with the driver who refused to give him an explanation.

He said: 'He charged me a different price from the way into town.

'I was asking him for an explanation, but he couldn't give me one and was just being grumpy and mumbling.

Mr Pickering was paid an out of court settlement of £1,500 after the bus driver lunged at him and bit him 

'I asked him for his details but he wasn't really saying anything.

'I couldn't see his badge so I took my phone out and I thought to myself that a photo of him would be just as good to take to the company.

'But he put the engine off, and it turned the lights off on the bus, and he started to get his paperwork together and he put his hand up and he knocked it out of my hand.

'It went to the floor.

'Then he bit me. He bit me on the boob.

Mr Pickering was bitten by the driver of a number 45 Arriva bus as he rowed over the ticket price in Derby 

'He was only 5ft 10 and I'm 6ft 10. I assume if we were the same height he would have bitten higher.'

Security officers then boarded the bus and the police were called.

A spokeswoman for Derbyshire Police confirmed the driver was arrested the following day on suspicion of assault and was cautioned.

Martin hired solicitors who have now secured a £1,500 out of court settlement following the incident in December 2013.

A spokesman for Arriva said: 'Arriva Midlands carried out a full and thorough investigation into this serious matter at the time and took appropriate action as per its policies and procedures.'
