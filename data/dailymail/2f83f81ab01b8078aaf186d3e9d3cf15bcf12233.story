Louis van Gaal will be armed with a £6million-a-year salary and a £200million transfer budget to help him ‘make history’ as Manchester United’s new manager.

The Holland coach’s appointment as David Moyes’ successor on a three-year deal was finally confirmed at 2pm on Monday, an hour after an internal email informed staff of the new managerial structure.

In a move that could be viewed as paving the way for a possible succession, Ryan Giggs was installed as his assistant. Giggs immediately announced his retirement as a player to concentrate on his new role.

The club still want to involve three other members of the Class of 92 - coaches Phil Neville, Nicky Butt and Paul Scholes - but no clearly defined roles have been outlined to them as yet.

Van Gaal will officially start work after the World Cup, but he has already begun shaping United’s fortunes for next season, by ordering a series of backroom departures and arrivals and drawing up a list of transfer targets.

While Germany defenders Mats Hummels and Holger Badstuber, midfielders such as Toni Kroos and Arjen Robben and striker Mario Mandzukic are all under consideration, decisions have already been implemented on back-up staff.

Goalkeeper coach Chris Woods, chief scout Robbie Cooke and analyst James Smith are among the notable casualties, while Van Gaal has decided against bringing Patrick Kluivert with him and will not be pursuing Danny Blind, who will be staying with the national team as assistant to Guus Hiddink.

In addition to Giggs, Holland goalkeeping coach Frans Hoek and coach Marcel Bout, a specialist in opposition scouting, will join the backroom team.

Though there are no plans to present the 62-year-old Van Gaal to the media, United released a reaction from their first-ever foreign manager that made it clear he was setting his sights high.

'It was always a wish for me to work in the Premier League,’ he said. ‘To work as a manager for Manchester United, the biggest club in the world, makes me very proud.

'I have managed in games at Old Trafford before and know what an incredible arena Old Trafford is and how passionate and knowledgeable the fans are.

‘This club has big ambitions. I too have big ambitions. Together I’m sure we will make history.’

Van Gaal can top up his basic salary with a hefty bonus for reaching the Champions League, and it was apparent from his demeanour that he intends cashing in at the earliest opportunity.

Winged wonder: Bayern Munich star Arjen Robben is being considered by his national manager as a target

Targeted by United bosses in the immediate aftermath of Moyes’ sacking in April, the former Ajax, Barcelona, AZ Alkmaar and Bayern Munich coach distanced himself from the chance to replace Tim Sherwood at Tottenham, once interest from Old Trafford became apparent.

Kluivert had been the early frontrunner to assist him, but his fervent wish for a right-hand man with a deep knowledge and feel for United’s tradition and history tilted the balance Giggs’ way.

After hanging up his boots to give his new coaching position his full attention, the 40-year old penned an open letter to United supporters, saying: 'I am immensely proud, honoured and fortunate to have represented the biggest club in the world 963 times.

'My dream was always to play for Manchester United, and though it saddens me to know I won’t be pulling on the United jersey again as a player, I have been lucky enough to fulfil that dream, playing with some of the best players in the world working under an incredible manager in Sir Alex Ferguson and, most of all, playing for the greatest fans in world football.

'This is a fantastic day for Manchester United. Louis Van Gaal is a great appointment, and I am delighted to be working with someone of his calibre. He is a world-class coach and I know I will learn a lot about coaching from being able to observe and contribute at such close quarters.

'Manchester United has been a huge part of my life and I’m delighted to be able to continue that relationship in such a key role. His credentials are second to none, and I am positive the club will thrive under his leadership in the coming years.'

United executive vice-chairman Ed Woodward said: 'In Louis van Gaal, we have secured the services of one of the outstanding managers in the game today.

'He has achieved many things in his career to date and Old Trafford provides him with a fitting stage on which to write new chapters in the Manchester United story.

'Everyone is very excited about this new phase in the club’s history. His track record of success in winning leagues and cups across Europe throughout his career makes him the perfect choice for us.

'People know him as a larger-than-life character but I have also been extremely impressed by his intelligence, thoughtful approach to the role and his diligence. I’m looking forward to working with him.'

Club owners Joel and Avie Glazer are convinced Van Gaal is the right man for the job.

Joel Glazer said: 'He has an outstanding pedigree as a coach, both as a man who motivates his teams to win trophies and as someone who believes in giving young players a chance to prove their worth. I am sure he will make a big impression on the club, the players and the fans.'

Avie Glazer said: 'Louis joins us at an exciting time and has already communicated some great ideas for how the club can move forward.

'The board is right behind him in his plans and everyone here is already looking forward to the start of next season.'
