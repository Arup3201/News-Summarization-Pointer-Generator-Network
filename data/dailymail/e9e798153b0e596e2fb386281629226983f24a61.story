Using Botox diminishes the experience of feeling emotion - making it 'morally wrong' to give to young people making their way in life, a new study has warned.

The anti-ageing treatment is becoming increasingly popular with teenagers who strive towards achieving the 'plastic' look seen in shows such as The Only Way Is Essex.

But by restricting their range of facial expressions, young people may 'stunt their emotional development', according to Helen Collier, an aesthetic nurse practitioner in Musselburgh, near Edinburgh.

Miss Collier, writing in the Journal of Aesthetic Nursing, claims the actions of smiling and frowning are not simply outlets for emotion, but key factors in the experience itself.

She is now urging her colleagues not to give the treatment to wrinkle-free people, reports The Times.

She said: 'Our ability to demonstrate a wide range of emotions is very dependent on facial expressions. 

'Emotions such as empathy or sympathy help us to survive and grow into confident adults.

'Removing the ability of the face to express these emotions can seriously affect the ability of patients to develop into maturity.'

The nurse is set to speak at the Clinical Cosmetic and Reconstructive Expo in London next month, where she will argue that Botox should only be given to people who show clear signs of ageing. 

She added: 'I wouldn't want to be associated with a practitioner who would happily stick a needle in a 16-year-old for £200.'

The nurse believes reality TV shows are to blame for the increase in under-25s seeking the treatment - as many want to look like the stars of shows such as The Only Way Is Essex. 

Botox is a drug made from a toxin produced by the bacterium Clostridium botulinum. 

The injections work by weakening or paralyzing certain muscles or by blocking certain nerves - thereby removing wrinkles.

The effects last about three to 12 months, depending on what you are treating. 

Side effects can include pain, swelling, or bruising at the injection site as well as drooping eyelids. 

You can also get flu-like symptoms, headaches, and an upset stomach. 

Pregnant women should not use Botox. 

She believes young people need to grow into their faces before they limit their ability to communicate and says that by dampening the ability to express feeling, they could stunt their emotional growth.

But she claims the treatment is fine for those in their late 30s, who have already developed emotionally. 

Three years ago the cosmetic surgery industry was rocked by the breast implant scandal involving French company, PIP.

The firm's products were banned after it emerged substandard silicone was being used - with many implants rupturing inside women's bodies.

Since then, the government has been considering whether tighter rules need to be introduced to regulate the cosmetic surgery industry.
