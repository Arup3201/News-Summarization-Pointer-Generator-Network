Shameless and Eastenders TV star Jody Latham arriving at Burnley Magistrates Court. He has admitted charges against him

Former Shameless and EastEnders actor Jody Latham has admitted growing cannabis and has been told he could face jail.

Latham, 30, was due to face trial after growing 24 plants worth about £14,000 at an address in Bacup, Lancashire, in May 2011.

But he entered a last minute guilty plea at Burnley Crown Court today. 

He is due to be sentenced on 17 December and has been told he could face up to a year in prison. 

His former girlfriend and accomplice Sarah Melia, 31, of Cotman Close, Bacup, has admitted allowing cannabis to be grown on a premises.

Pre-sentence reports are now being prepared on her and Latham, who was once romantically linked to X-Factor judge Tulisa Contostavlos.

The actor, played 'Lip' Gallagher in Channel 4 drama Shameless and also starred as pimp Rob Grayson in the BBC soap EastEnders.

He was arrested in May after up to 24 plants were found behind a false wall inside a garage at a house in Bacup.

Burnley Crown Court was told Latham was growing the drug at Melia’s home and she allowed it to go on. 

Latham, who has a caution for producing cannabis, apparently had a 'bad' addiction to the drug at the time but had since had weekly treatment at The Priory.

The hearing was told the prosecution had alleged 24 cannabis plants, worth about £14,000, were being grown.

But Latham claims there were 16 plants worth £9,820.

Latham of Market Street, Bacup, who has convictions for assault and threatening, abusive or insulting words or behaviour, admitted producing cannabis between March 31 and May 14 2011.

Melia, 31, of Cotman Close, Bacup, pleaded guilty to permitting premises at Acre Park to be used for the production of the drug, between the same dates.

Both were unconditionally bailed until sentence at the court on December 17.

Judge Beverley Lunt told the actor he could be sent to jail, for a maximum of 12 months.

She added: 'I am not saying I will. I need to know more about you.'

She told both defendants: 'What sentence is passed will depend on what’s in the pre - sentence reports.'

Asked by Wayne Jackson, Latham's lawyer, if she knew who she was dealing with, Judge Lunt said: 'I know nothing about him.

'Am I supposed to know something about him? I have never heard of Shameless. I have heard of EastEnders.'

The actor’s career took off at the age of 12 when he was spotted during performances at Burley Youth Theatre.

He played the intelligent and outspoken eldest son of Frank Gallagher in Channel 4’s acclaimed drama Shameless between 2004 and 2008.

He appeared as Grayson in EastEnders between February and March last year.

But he has also starred in ITV’s The Fixer and had a stint as a trainee chef in Gordon Ramsay’s Hell’s Kitchen.
