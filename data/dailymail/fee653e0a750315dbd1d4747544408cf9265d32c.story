Out of pie: Sir Tony Robinson, who played Baldrick in Blackadder, has lost two stone on a juicing diet

He was famously unwashed  and prone to illness as Baldrick in TV’s Blackadder.

Yet Sir Tony Robinson – who is also presenter of long-running archaeology show Time Team –  is a health freak in real life.

The actor has been on a strict vegetable and fruit juice diet for three months and has managed  to shed 2st.

‘At the start I had juices for  every meal and that was it,’ he explains.

‘For the first three days  it felt very strange not to be chewing anything, but after a week I felt fantastic.

‘I realised I was getting more nutrients from the juices than I did from eating regular food.’

Sir Tony, 67, decided to go on the regime before signing up for a role in a ballet adaptation of The Wind In The Willows in London’s West End.

He’s the narrator and, although not dancing, he is on stage in every single scene.

‘Physically, it’s very draining as I’m  on stage for two hours at a time,’ he says.

‘However, on this juice plan I’ve got more energy than ever.

'I’ve started to cut back to juicing for breakfast and lunch, and eating some fish with steamed vegetables in the evening, and I think I’ll continue like this for a while.

‘I just feel fantastic as I can do the shows, run around with my grandchildren and I’ve lost 2st.

‘I don’t know why I never did it in the past!’

It seems that Baldrick’s ‘cunning plan’ is actually working out well for once.

Taking a Vitamin D supplement can ease chronic pain and fatigue in fibromyalgia sufferers if they have low levels, according to a new study.

Those taking the supplement showed improved physical functioning in a trial of 30 female patients at the Orthopaedic Hospital in Vienna. The improvement was still marked 24 weeks after the supplementation had ended.

Fibromyalgia is a long-term condition that causes pain all over the body, including difficulty sleeping, headaches, irritable bowel syndrome and muscle stiffness.

‘Vitamin D may be regarded as relatively safe and economical,’ says lead investigator Florian Wepner.

lashing out: Gail Porter pictured being hit by birch twigs in a bid to lose weight

Her
 nude form was once projected on to Big Ben. Now Gail Porter has been 
having her naked body beaten with twigs to lose weight.

The
 TV presenter, right, has been receiving 20-minute lashings with the 
birch sticks, called venik, at a Slimmeria retreat in East Sussex.

‘It’s
 quite forceful and strangely exciting,’ says Gail, 42. ‘When she first 
hit me I thought, “Give us a break,’’ but I thoroughly enjoyed it. I’ve 
lost weight already and have another stone and a half to lose.’

A Slimmeria spokesman says:  ‘It facilitates the removal of toxins.’

Old-school ninja: Game Fruit Ninja has been found to help stroke victims

Fruit Ninja, the smartphone app that involves ‘slicing’ flying melons with the  swipe of a finger, may help stroke patients recover, according to an Australian study of 18 healthy participants aged 49 to 72 and five patients who had recently suffered a stroke.

After being asked to play Fruit Ninja for an hour a  day, five days a week over a period of three weeks, the stroke patients showed significant improvement in upper limb function.

Good neighbours are beneficial to your health.

People who live in a close-knit community have a lower risk of suffering from strokes, according to a University of Michigan study of 6,740 people.

Researchers say it could be because social interaction and trust is important to reducing the risk of stroke.

Those in a friendly neighbourhood were 15 per cent less likely to suffer a stroke.

And people in the closest communities were 48 per cent less likely to have a stroke, according to the study published  in Social Science and Medicine.

A stroke is caused by a disruption in blood flow to the brain. More than 150,000 Britons a year suffer strokes, and it is the third leading cause of death.
