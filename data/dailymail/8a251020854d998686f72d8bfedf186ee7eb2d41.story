Apprentice: Prince Andrew, who never went to university and instead trained as a Navy pilot, says university is not an automatic route to a job

Prince Andrew says vocational courses should be taken more seriously, claiming many graduates are unprepared for the world of work.

University should be regarded only as the ‘icing on the cake’ for people entering the jobs market, not an automatic route to a job, he said.

The Duke of York added he believed the government’s expansion of University Technical  Colleges (UTCs) – which focus on practical learning and have close links with business – would give students an advantage over teenagers who do A-levels and then enter higher education.

He said: ‘Coming out of university there’s a tendency to believe that you are trained as well as educated, which is not actually true.’

He added: ‘Choosing an apprenticeship path and doing a foundation degree and then going on to university, you will always have the advantage over many of your university colleagues because you have earned your spurs in the business world before going to university.’

‘I didn’t go to university. I went straight to the Navy and did an apprenticeship as a pilot.  University is the icing on the cake rather than a route to market,’ he told the Daily Telegraph.

The Duke has been promoting apprenticeships after giving up his role as the UK’s trade ambassador.

This followed scandals including his friendships with convicted paedophile Jeffrey Epstein and Colonel Gaddafi’s son Saif al-Islam. He launched the Duke of York awards last year,  presented for excellence in technical education.

UTCs were introduced under Labour but are expanding under the Coalition.

Plans for 40 new colleges were announced in October.

Pupils study for high-level practical qualifications in areas such as catering, healthcare and construction, and do GCSEs and A-levels like maths, English and sciences.

'Educated but untrained': The Duke of York said that many graduates come out of university believing that they are ready for work, but in fact they are not yet well equipped for a role in industry

Some go straight into work but others go to university.

Critics
 include Association of School and  College Leaders general secretary 
Brian Lightman, who has said they risk ‘perpetuating the social 
stratification that pervades our society’.

Mary
 Curnock Cook, chief executive of universities admissions service UCAS, 
warned in November that figures showed more teenagers were ditching 
A-levels for vocational qualifications to try to win places on 
undergraduate courses.

She 
said pupils from poor backgrounds are likelier to take BTECs than those 
from wealthier  families, which tends to lead to rejection by  top  
universities.

But 
Prince Andrew said last month that having employers involved with 
schools gave pupils an advantage because the business input provided 
useful skills knowledge.
