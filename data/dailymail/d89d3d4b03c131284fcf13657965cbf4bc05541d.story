Chinese Vice President Xi Jinping will visit the U.S. this week for crucial talks aimed at strengthening trust before he takes over as leader of the world's most populous 
nation later this year.

Xi is due to meet with President Barack Obama and other top officials in
Washington on Tuesday.

He will make a stop in the midwestern state of 
Iowa on Wednesday to meet local politicians and families with whom he 
stayed on a 1985 visit while serving as a local official in charge of 
the pork industry.

Xi, who is scheduled to leave Beijing later today, finishes the U.S. leg of his visit in California for meetings with 
business leaders and will stop in Ireland and Turkey before returning 
home.

The U.S. visit seeks to better acquaint politicians and opinion makers 
with the man widely expected to begin taking charge later this year of 
the world's second largest economy and biggest overseas holder of U.S. 
government debt.

Despite their close economic links, China and the U.S. remain major 
rivals in the Asia-Pacific region, with Washington's traditional 
alliances competing with China's economic and cultural influence.

China 
sees the U.S. as encouraging scepticism and dissent among neighbours in 
the region while trying to undermine communist rule by encouraging civil
liberties and human rights causes.

Meanwhile, the perceived economic threat posed by China to the U.S. has 
also featured prominently in the Republican Party presidential 
nomination process.

One aspect of Xi's visit will be to gauge public 
perceptions of China in the U.S. and seek ways of overcoming a lack of 
trust between the sides, a task made more difficult by disputes over 
trade, Taiwan, human rights and international concerns such as 
intervening in the ongoing violence in Syria.

Writing in the official English-language China Daily newspaper, a 
collection of well-known Chinese scholars said ties are dogged by strong
Chinese perceptions that the U.S. aims to contain Beijing's growth, 
particularly as Washington carries through a strategic pivot shifting 
attention and resources back to the Asia-Pacific.

The scholars, who  included 
Wang Jisi and Jia Qingguo of Peking University's School of International
Studies, top advisers to Chinese President Hu Jintao, wrote: 'Judging from the present situation of China-U.S. relations, the 
strategic mutual trust between the two sides still lags far behind the 
common interests they actually share.'

In written responses to questions from The Washington Post, Xi 
highlighted the profitability of U.S. companies operating in China, 
along with Beijing's efforts to address American concerns over 
intellectual property theft and claims that the Chinese currency is 
deliberately undervalued to help boost exports.

But he also made a dig at U.S. efforts to strengthen its military 
alliances in Asia, saying what U.S. officials have said are hardline 
personal views on China's security and national dignity.

He said: 'We welcome a constructive role by the United States in promoting peace,
stability and prosperity in the region.

'We also hope that the United 
States will fully respect and accommodate the major interest and 
legitimate concerns of Asia-Pacific countries.'

Xi's visit is unlikely to produce major commercial deals, in contrast to
earlier trips by Chinese officials that often featured purchases of 
U.S. jetliners and other goods in an effort to ease tension over 
Beijing's multibillion-dollar trade surplus.

On Wednesday, Chinese officials are due to attend the signing in Des 
Moines, Iowa, of a purchase agreement for soy beans, the biggest single 
U.S. export to China. No details of price or size were announced.

Businessmen and trade groups said they knew of no other major deals 
scheduled to be completed during the visit. A spokesman at Boeing Co., 
Yukui Wang, said he knew of no planned purchases of Boeing aircraft.

On Tuesday, Xi will speak before 600 corporate and policy leaders at a 
Washington lunch organised by the U.S.-China Business Council and the 
National Committee on U.S.-China Relations.

In Los Angeles, Xi is to take part in an investment-promotion event 
sponsored by China's Ministry of Commerce and the U.S. Department of 
Commerce.
