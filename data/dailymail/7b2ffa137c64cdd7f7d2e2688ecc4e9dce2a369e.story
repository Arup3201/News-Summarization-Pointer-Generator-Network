You can follow anyone home in a New York City taxi - virtually at least.

On October 4, 2013, at 1:21pm, Katherine Heigl took a cab from Manhattan's West Side and got out near Penn Station at 1:40pm. The trip cost $14.50 and she left a $3.62 tip.

By contrast, on May 21, Emma Roberts and fiance Evan Peters got into a taxi on Park Avenue and got dropped off about a mile east. $6.50 fare but only a $1 tip.

Generous: On October 4, 2013, Katherine Heigl went from 80 N Moore Street to 421 8th Avenue, near Madison Square Garden, and tipped $3.62 on a $14.50 fare, about 25 percent

Midtown: Kourtney Kardashian and Scott Disick rode from 246 Spring Street to 1412 6th Ave from 12:11 to 12:36pm on November 4, 2013, paying a $16.50 fare and tipping $3.40

Gawker reports that this look into the travel patterns of celebrities in New York comes not from an overenthusiastic paparazzo but from a very revealing set of data available from the city.

The Taxi and Limousine Commission compiles data from every ride taken during the year—there were 173million in 2013 alone—recording fare, tip, pickup and dropoff locations and more.

Though the city tried to make it difficult to track individual taxis, a handful of determined data scientists cracked the code and made it possible to search for any ride by knowing the time, location and medallion number. 

Thanks to Anthony Tockar, who wrote about the dataset at his internship with analytics firm Neustar, we now know it's possible to know where celebrities were headed when they hopped in a yellow cab.

By using photos from paparazzi and gossip blogs from 2013 where celebrities were seen getting in and out of cars, Tockar took the medallion numbers that were visible and IDed taxis in the dataset using the time of the pickup or dropoff.

From there, the rest of the route information could be gleaned, and the data could be compared against another set outlining fare and tip information to give a full picture of the celeb's ride. 

For instance, on July 8, 2013, Bradley Cooper was photographed getting into a cab along the west side of Manhattan at 7:34pm.

Using the dataset, Tockar found he headed from there to the West Village and got dropped off near posh eatery Melibea, a 10-minute ride that cost $10.50.

Village: Ashlee Simpson took a taxi from 78 Crosby Street to 580 Hudson Street from 3:29 to 3:38pm on January 6, 2013, a $7.50 fare that she left a $2 tip on

West: Amanda Bynes got into a taxi on April 11, 2013 at 229 W 28th Street at 5:43pm and got off at 271 W 47th Street at 6:02pm. She paid the $13 fare in cash and the tip was not recorded

Village: On June 21, 2013, from 11:28 to 11:35am, Judd Apatow rode with Leslie Mann north in the West Village to One Abingdon Square, and the pair paid a $7 fare with a $2.10 tip

Crosstown: Olivia Munn trekked across the island from 225 Varick Street to 325 Bowery at 11:20am on July 8, 2013, paying a $6 fare in cash, with the tip not recorded

West-sider: Bradley Cooper heads out from 376 Greenwich Avenue before getting out at 13 Bank Street near eatery Melibea on July 8, 2013, paying his $10.50 fare in cash, with the tip not recorded

The data also revealed what celebrities tipped when they paid for their rides with a card. Though Roberts and Evans may have been towards the stingy side, most celebrities chipped in close to 20 percent or more. 

When people paid with cash, the tip was often not recorded so there's no way to know if the celebs threw in a generous bonus or stiffed their drivers completely.

The news that people can hack the 2013 dataset fairly easily knowing only a taxicab's medallion number has unsettled some, in spite of the data being a year old. 

The other option, take an Uber. But according to Valleywag, the Silicon Valley ridesharing startup was revealed to have its own problem keeping data under wraps, after venture capitalist Peter Sims found his ride use being watched by guests at a company party for their amusement.

NoHo to Midtown: Jessica Biel took a cab from 342 Bowery at 2:52pm to 8 E 23rd Street at 3:07pm on May 6, 2013, and recorded a $11.50 fare, with the tip amount unknown

West side: Model Karolina Kurkova took a cab on June 26, 2013, from 112 Hudson Street to 624 W 26th Street from 11:23 to 11:32pm, paying a $10 fare and a $2 tip

Splurge: Emma Roberts and fiance Evan Peters took a ride from 875 Park Ave at 2:46pm to 533 E 84th Street at 2:53pm on May 21, 2013, with a $6.50 fare, though they only tipped $1
