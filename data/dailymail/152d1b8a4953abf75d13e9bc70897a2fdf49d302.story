David Beckham has given his public support to Brazil's injured talisman Neymar by posting pictures of the pair together over the years via his Facebook page.

Neymar suffered a fractured vertebra in his back during the World Cup hosts 2-1 quarter-final win against Colombia on Friday.

The injury means the forward will miss the rest of the tournament and Beckham has become the latest star to show his sympathy for the 22-year-old by digging out a series of photographs of the duo dating back from 2006.

Accompanied with the message 'You will come back even stronger,' the first of the three pictures show the former England captain, then at Real Madrid, posing with a shy 14-year-old Neymar.

The second photo shows the pair smiling together in 2012 while Beckham was at MLS outfit LA Galaxy.

The final picture taken from November 2013 depicts Neymar in Brazil's team tracksuit pointing a finger at the then 38-year-old.

Colombia's Juan Zuniga's challenge on Neymar's has caused outrage in Brazil, with captain Thiago Silva brandishing it a 'coward's tackle'.

The defender, who will also miss Tuesday's semi-final against Germany through suspension, said: 'It was a coward’s tackle - some people say it was normal, but I don’t think it was...

'That kind of challenge isn’t done. You can’t get the ball from someone by putting your knee into a player’s back, it’s not normal. But there you are.’

FIFA confirmed on Monday that no disciplinary action would be taken against Zuniga, who has received a flurry of abuse for causing the injury even though he has made two public apologies.
