'At least we're not Blackpool'.

That mantra is just about all Birmingham City have had to cling on to of late with crises on and off the field suffocating the club.

But Gary Rowett taking the managerial job on offer from the club is confirmation that things, even given Saturday's 8-0 mauling by Bournemouth, could indeed be worse.

As Sportsmail revealed in September, Rowett turned down an unofficial approach from Blackpool to replace Jose Riga as their manager.

Rowett, having sought assurances over Birmingham's finances before taking the job on Monday, must therefore see some light at the end of the St Andrew's tunnel in spite of the current malaise at the club.

That being said, emotional attachment is sure to have played a part in Rowett's decision. He spent two years at Birmingham as a player from 1998 to 2000.

But even if the club do not find much-needed financial investment soon, it's hard to think of a more suitable appointment at this time by Birmingham than Rowett.

The task at hand for him is not an easy one by an stretch.

Anyone who thought sacking Lee Clark would immediately see an up-turn in form suffered a rude awakening on Saturday as a team picked and prepared by caretaker Malcolm Crosby were annihilated in front of their own fans.

Neil Lennon and Kit Symons have revived the fortunes of Bolton and Fulham respectively in recent weeks, but the players were always there at those clubs. The squad assembled by Clark, on the other hand, is on paper frankly not good enough to stay in the Championship.

Birmingham, along with Blackpool, stand out as lacking the pedigree of player to compete with the best in the second tier.

A talented crop of youngsters are complemented by a smattering of players signed by Clark from the lower leagues who, to a man, have not delivered.

If Birmingham are to stand any chance of staying up Rowett must use the loan market wisely and get some of Clark's signings performing.

Even assuming that Blackpool go down, Birmingham must leapfrog two more sides to stay up, and it is hard to see how they can do that.

Those clubs immediately above them - Bolton, Fulham and Wigan - are all on an upward trajectory and should have more than enough about them to ease in to mid-table at least.

More realistically, Rowett will be hoping to hunt down Leeds, Huddersfield, Rotherham and Millwall, all of whom are already five or six points clear of the Blues. For a club bereft of confidence with just two wins under their belt this season, that is a big gap.

But if anyone can do it, it's Rowett.

Speaking to Sportsmail in September 2012, the 40-year-old's passion for coaching and, more specifically, improving players - something he will have to do at Birmingham - was evident.

'I've been coaching for eight years now, which I think a lot of people don't realise,' Rowett, now with 10 years' experience, said.

'When I finished at Charlton at aged 30 I had about a month off and then went straight into coaching.

'I looked back and realised I had had a good career, but I knew straight away that it wouldn't mean anything if I couldn't coach. I might get away with it for a year or two, but it didn't mean anything to me really.

'I thought, "right, I've got to start again and learn my role, learn how to coach properly".'

That drive, passion and experience allows Rowett to exude an infectious confidence that brings the best out in his players, or certainly has done at Burton for the past two-and-a-half years.

At the Pirelli Stadium, Rowett made and maintained side noted for their organisation, consistency and professionalism, all things that Birmingham have lacked badly in recent years.

Rowett, who cites Joe Royle, Sam Allardyce, Steve McClaren and Alan Curbishley as his biggest influences, was a defender in his playing days so will no doubt look to address Birmingham's backline as a priority.

The Blues are conceding on average two goals per game - only Scunthorpe have conceded more than their 28 in the entire Football League.

Perhaps most importantly of all, Rowett has the personality and background to bring the fans back to St Andrew's.

Birmingham's home form has been woeful for a couple of years now and Clark, with the exception of those final-day survival celebrations at Bolton last season, never really connected with the fans.

Rowett should not have the same problem. He was popular in his time at the club as a player, playing in a period that Blues fans look back on fondly.

Another reason why moving for him makes perfect sense by a club whose decision-making has been questionable in recent times to say the least.

You'd still be a brave man to back Birmingham to stay up. But if anyone can do it, it's Gary Rowett.

Good week for... PRESTON. Simon Grayson's side made it six wins on the spin against Fleetwood as a 19-minute Joe Garner hat-trick completed a remarkable comeback from 2-0 down. So good is Preston's form that they will go above unbeaten Bristol City at the top of League One should they win their two games in hand.

Bad week for... BURTON. Not only are they losing their manager, the Brewers somehow managed to contrive to lose to Stevenage despite their hosts not having a single shot all game on Saturday. A late Ian Sharps own goal settled it as Gary Rowett's former side, who had five shots, slipped to third in the League Two table.

Talent scout: Lasse Vigen Christensen (Fulham)

Fulham's revival under Kit Symons gathered pace on Friday night with a 3-0 win over London rivals Charlton. The Cottagers were sensational in the first half with Danish midfielder Christensen epitomising their energy, speed and accuracy when passing the ball. If Fulham had blooded youngsters such as the 20-year-old Christensen last season they might just have stayed up.
