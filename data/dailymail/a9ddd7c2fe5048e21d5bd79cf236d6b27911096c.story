A driver has told how she had to swerve and skid to a halt to avoid hitting George Michael after he fell from a car travelling at around 70mph on to a fast lane of the M1.

Katherine Fox said she didn’t know how the singer survived the rush-hour fall which left him dazed, covered in blood and with his tracksuit top ripped to shreds.

Michael, a passenger in the silver Range Rover, slammed into the carriageway after apparently opening his door to shut it properly.

Screeched to a halt: Katherine Fox (pictured) has described the moment she nearly ran over George Michael as he lay covered in blood on the M1 after falling from his car at 70mph

Miss Fox, 23, who was driving behind in her Mini, braked before reversing to shield the star from other vehicles.

An off-duty policeman directed traffic
around the scene. Michael, 49, was airlifted to hospital where he was 
said by his spokesman last night to be ‘making good progress’ five days 
after the drama.

But Miss Fox, a children’s nanny, 
said: ‘I honestly don’t know how he survived. He had a bad cut on his 
face and the blood was running down over his mouth and teeth.

'He was in 
shock, breathing and conscious, but looked terrible. There was so much 
blood on his face that I didn’t recognise him.’

Michael hit the third of four lanes 
on a northbound stretch of the motorway near St Albans, Hertfordshire. 
His trainers and trademark designer sunglasses were flung into another 
lane by the impact.

Miss Fox said: ‘I saw blood everywhere
and he was on the ground. I thought someone had run across the road and
been hit until I was told what happened.

‘Someone said he tried to open the car
door and shut it again because it wasn’t shut properly and apparently 
fell out. I was told the car wasn’t speeding and was doing 70mph.

‘I was on the phone to the ambulance 
and said, “You’d better come quick. This doesn’t look good”. An off-duty
policeman was telling me what to say and re-directing the traffic which
had slowed down.

‘George was wearing a black and gold 
Adidas tracksuit that was ripped all down the arm and shoulder. He had 
no trainers on. I grabbed one from the second lane because cars were 
swerving to avoid it. His sunglasses were also in the road. I could hear
the crunch as cars drove over them.’

The two friends who were travelling 
with Michael pulled on to the hard shoulder and ran back across two 
lanes of traffic to help.

Miss Fox added: ‘George didn’t say 
anything, he just seemed in shock. He was sitting down against a car and
in the arms of his friend.

Quick-thinking: Miss Fox reversed her Mini to a point in the carriageway where it shielded Michael from oncoming traffic as an off-duty police officer helped to direct vehicles around the scene

‘The guy holding him was quite scared.
He kept saying to George, “Are you alright, mate?” I think George was 
lucky he didn’t die.

‘If he’d landed in the second lane he 
would have been hit by a car without a doubt. He was in the middle of 
the M1. I could have run him over.’

Paramedics arrived quickly and the singer was airlifted to hospital just after 6pm last Thursday.

Miss Fox, from Luton, said: ‘I didn’t 
know it was George Michael until the next day when I saw it  on the 
television. There was so much blood over his face. It was so shocking at
the time I just focused on making sure he was alright.’

Michael’s spokesman said last night 
that he was in hospital for observation after suffering ‘cuts and bumps’
to his head. She added that he was ‘looking forward to getting back to 
his home soon’.

At the singer’s home in Highgate, 
North London, his boyfriend Fadi Fawaz, 39, said on the day after the 
incident: ‘He is perfectly fine. Of course I was worried, but I have 
spoken to him and he is good. I have no idea what happened, I wasn’t 
there.’

A Hertfordshire Police spokesman said officers were still investigating the incident.

Michael, who has enjoyed a successful 
solo career since finding fame in the 1980s duo Wham!, was close to 
death only 18 months ago after being struck down with pneumonia in 
Vienna.

He is currently banned from driving. 
Three years ago he was jailed for eight weeks for crashing a Range Rover
into a shop in North London while under the influence of drugs.

He was also disqualified from driving
for five years, having served a two-year ban imposed in 2006 when he 
was convicted of driving while on drugs after being found slumped in his
Mercedes.
