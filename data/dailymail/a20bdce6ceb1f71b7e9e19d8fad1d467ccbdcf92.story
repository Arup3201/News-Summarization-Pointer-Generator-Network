 A young Belgian tourist has been subjected to what police described as a 'horrific sexual attack' - just three days after arriving in Australia.

What she had planned as an enjoyable holiday in the country turned to terror when she was dragged into a dark lane by her attacker who sexually assaulted her for several minutes as people walked past in a nearby street.

The attack, in Sydney's Potts Point inner suburb, has left the 25-year-old woman so traumatised that she was unable to say much to police today.

Detectives said they are still waiting for the woman to get over her shock in the hope she will be able to give them a description of her attacker.

Potts Point is adjacent to the more notorious Kings Cross district which has a reputation as a hunting ground for drug addicts and prostitutes - but leafy Potts Point has homes that are worth up to 100 million pounds sterling. 

The tourist has managed to tell police that she now just wants to go home.

Police Superintendent Michael Fitzgerald told Sydney's Daily Telegraph: 'This was a horrific attack for someone who has been in the country for only three days to experience.'

The tourist was staying at a serviced apartment and was on her way there at 8.30pm on Wednesday when she was attacked from behind and dragged into the laneway.

Details of the sexual assault have not been released by police.

In a distressed state, the un-named woman reported what had happened to the apartment block's concierge.

Police were last night examining CCTV footage in the hope the attacker might be identified.

Miss Lilli Ke, 24, who lives just a few yards from the lane, said: 'This is very scary.  I feel very sorry for the woman.

'I always thought it was safe here but now I am not so sure. '
