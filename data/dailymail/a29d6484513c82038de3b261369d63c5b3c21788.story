She may never become a princess after splitting with Prince Harry, but Cressida Bonas has a none-too-shabby back-up plan: Hollywood stardom.

That's according to a man who knows Hollywood better than any - mega film producer Harvey Weinstein.

The movie mogul called Cressida a 'fantastic' actress and said he believes she has a long Hollywood career ahead of her, in a report in the Evening Standard newspaper.

The 25-year-old beauty is making her debut film appearance in a Weinstein production, Tulip Fever, which also stars Cara Delevingne, Daisy Lowe and Dame Judi Dench and is due out later in the year.

'Cressida is great in Tulip Fever and people will see what a fantastic actress she is... it will be the first of many roles for her,' said Weinstein, according to the paper.

He also praised her for not using her famous name to propel her acting career. 'She is not taking advantage if any media profile,' he said, speaking at the screening of one of his new films, Big Eyes, in London last night, which Cressida also attended.

Society girl Cressida has been cast as merchant's wife Mrs Steen for her debut role in Tulip Fever.

The film is an adaptation of the the novel by Deborah Moggach about a 17th century romance in which an artist falls for a married young woman while he's commissioned to paint her portrait.

A thumbs-up for her from the big man on Hollywood is a great start to her career. Weinstein who won an Oscar for Shakespeare in Love, has produced huge hits including Pulp Fiction and Gangs Of New York, as well as critically acclaimed films like The King's Speech and My Week With Marilyn.

Appearing in a Harvey Weinstein film, certainly did no harm for Gwyneth Paltrow, who the producer is said to have championed.

Gwynnie went on to win an Oscar for her role and has been cast in eight of Harvey's other movie successes.

In fact in Hollywood, Harvey Weinstein ranks somewhere close to God. A 2013 study of Oscars speeches over the last 60 years  revealed that the producer has been thanked a total of 12 times - more than the Almighty himself.

Will Cressida be clutching a little golden man and thanking Harvey Weinstein in the future? Watch this space.
