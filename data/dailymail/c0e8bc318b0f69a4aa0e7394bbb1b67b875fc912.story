A woman who was told she was too fat to join the forces has shed a whopping 5st in a bid to land her dream job in the Royal Navy.

Melissa Beer, 23, from Derby, suffered years of torment from bullies about her size 22 frame but it was passion for a career at sea that finally helped her slim down.

She put a stop to years of binge eating after discovering that she needed to weigh less than 11st to pursue her dream to enroll in the Royal Navy.

Determined, she signed up for a gruelling boot camp to get herself into shape - and dropped from 15st 9lb to a slinky 10st 12lb - slipping into a size 10 - 12 dress.

Melissa, who is currently a clinical and optical assistant at an opticians, said: 'I've been big all my life and it made me so miserable.

'All I've ever wanted to do was join the Navy but I knew I was always too big to even consider it - I would never make it past the fitness test.

'By the age of ten I weighed ten stone, when I was 11 I weighed 11st and the weight just kept creeping on.

Having now passed her fitness test Melissa will be starting her Navy training this month

'I was emotionally bullied so much at school that my mum would have to force me to go and I would come home crying every day.

'It's really sad that people don't allow themselves to get to know you, they just see what's on the outside and laugh and ridicule you for the way you look.

Melissa struggled with her weight throughout her childhood and as a result was subjected to emotionally and even physical bullying by her peers

'On one occasion I was leaving school when a boy ran up behind me and kicked me so hard in the back for no reason. I just kept walking and didn't allow myself to cry until I had reached the car.'

Melissa was subjected to bullying and horrible taunts for years which resulted in her having low self confidence

It wasn't until Melissa's sister, Amy, encouraged her to go to the Derbyshire based Booticamp Babes, which was set up in 2012, that she finally began to lose weight.

'A few years ago my feet were hurting so I sat down on the pavement to rest them when a group of lads walked past laughing saying 'It's funny because she's fat.'

Melissa always dreamed of joining the Navy, but knew her unhealthy eating habits and size would prevent her passing the fitness tests

'I was so hurt I cried all the way home.

'I know I was big, I didn't like to wear jeans as when I walked my legs would rub together and they used to be red and covered in sores, but it was so horrible to be judged in such a horrible way.

'One day my sister told me she had joined a new weight loss group called Booticamp Babes and encouraged me to go with her, I was sceptical at first but it was the best thing I ever did.

'I signed up for just a week which was free to begin with, but I loved every minute and couldn't wait to go back.'

In order for Melissa to join the Navy she knew she would have to be fit and complete numerous touch physical challenges.

Melissa used to go out drinking three or four nights a week (left)  but during her weight loss cut out  alcohol completely, beating her original weight loss targets (right)

Melissa's original aim was to weigh less than 13st but after smashing that target she decided to lose even more.

'I was put on an eating plan and swapped all my junk food for healthy fresh food and went to at least three fitness classes a week.

'I used to go out three or four times a week and have a drink but I completely cut alcohol out as it would only delay my progress.

And the hard work paid off as Melissa is now enrolled in the Navy's basic training course after passing the fitness test she thought she'd never be able to complete.

'I knew the fitness test would be hard but I wanted more than anything to complete it, I had to run 1.5 miles in less than 13 minutes and 15 seconds, complete swimming tests and a series of sit-ups

'I was ecstatic when I achieved what I'd set out to do.'

Melissa will be going to Plymouth on May 25 and will be leaving her Booitcamp Babes behind but will be back to visit.

The Royal Navy's basic training lasts 10 weeks, after which Melissa will start a 19-week training course.

She said 'I can't wait, I've waited so long for this so bring it on. I will keep going no matter what obstacles are thrown at me.'

Sarah Whitehead, the founder of Booticamp Babes, said: 'We couldn't want any more for Melissa - she's such an inspiration and we are all so proud of her for achieving her dream.

'We are all going to miss her and can't wait for her to visit us again in the future so she can tell us all about what she's been up to in the Navy - we wish her all the best.'
