Lauren got impatient waiting for baby and visited the beauty salon for numerous treatments

As the world waits for news of the Royal baby, we may all be getting a bit impatient, but if you're feeling frustrated, imagine how Kate is feeling.

I don't have to imagine as I know exactly how it feels to be overdue - my baby was 16 days late!

When you are told your due date early in pregnancy you become fixated on that date, everything revolves around that day, 20 weeks to go, 2 weeks to go, two days to go and then suddenly that all important date comes and goes and you're left in limbo.

Every call you make is answered with 'Are you in labour?' and your Facebook becomes filled with messages asking 'Any sign of this baby yet?'.

It started to drive me crazy, to a point I stopped making calls and even put a message on Facebook advising people not to ask if the baby had arrived as if it had I would let them know. 

Luckily I only had eager friends and family waiting on my baby's arrival, poor Kate has not only a country, but most of the world waiting for her happy news.

But no matter how much she may will 
this baby to make an appearance, the truth is that the baby will only 
arrive when it's ready.

I'm
sure Kate has been bombarded with advice from mothers telling her what 
methods brought on their labours, well I tried them all, long walks, 
bumpy roads, pineapple, curries, raspberry leaf capsules and endlessly 
bouncing on my birthing ball, but nothing would budge my little girl. 

When I reached 41 weeks I had an appointment at the local birth centre where I had reflexology and acupressure, I was also given what is called a 'cervical sweep', I'll not go into details but all I'll say is it was certainly not one of the most pleasant experiences of my life! 

I left the centre feeling quite positive
and was told this could help bring on labour in the next 24 to 48 
hours. But two days later there was still no sign of the little one. So,
as much as the sweep was not enjoyable, I would do anything to get this
baby out so back I went for another one and then a third, but yet again
no joy.

She had 'almost all on offer' and when she went into hospital she was so dolled up she looked like a Barbie

By this stage the impatience was starting to drive me mad, every day seemed to last a lifetime but the only thing that kept me sane was keeping busy. 

I arranged to do something every single day, I met friends for lunch, went shopping, went to the cinema, walked endlessly round the park and made several visits to the beautician. In fact I called into the beauticians so often I had almost all of the treatments on offer.

I had my toenails and fingernails 
painted, maternity massages, hair extensions and even false eyelashes, 
so by the time I was taken into hospital I looked like a pregnant Barbie
Doll.

The day before I went into hospital to be induced was the worst day of all. My bump was so enormous I actually thought my stomach might explode, I couldn't sleep properly and couldn't bend down to even put my socks on. I was tired, hot, huge and extremely frustrated.

What made it worse was that one of my friends from my antenatal course, who was due two weeks after me, had gone into labour that morning. I cried most of that day and even called the hospital, begging for them to take me in, but despite my pleas they said I had to wait one more day.

It was not just me who was feeling frustrated, my poor other half was just as anxious as me to meet our little one, and he also had to put up with my emotional outbursts. Therefore my sympathies are not just with Kate, but William also, although at least he doesn't have a giant bump to contend with.

As baby was approaching 16 days late, Lauren felt her bump so enormous her stomach might explode

So finally, after 14 days, endless beauty treatments, far too many curries and an overdose of raspberry leaf tea, on the 9th April I waddled into Pembury Hospital, with my fake hair and eyelashes, and started to get excited about finally seeing my baby.  But she was stubborn and refused to budge for another two days.

Finally on 11th April, 16 days past my due date, my beautiful baby girl Sophia Belle Hampshire arrived into this world. I still had my false eyelashes on but after two days of labour I was far from glamorous and refused to let a camera near me.

Unfortunately for Kate, I don't think she will be able to avoid the cameras for long but until the Royal baby arrives my advice to her is to keep busy, go for long walks, get pampered and enjoy getting some sleep as you'll not be getting much of that over the next few months.

She felt in limbo as her due date came and went, she couldn't bend down and was totally exhausted
