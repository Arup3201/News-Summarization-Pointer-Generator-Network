News consumption among young adults is in rapid decline, according to a new study.

A poll conducted by the Associated Press and the NORC at the University of Chicago revealed that only 37per cent of under 30s consider it 'very important' to keep up-to-date with current affairs compared to 56per cent 30 years ago.

One college junior quizzed as part of the findings said that she doesn't follow politics much because of 'so much negativity'.

Overall, despite unprecedented access to information, 28per cent of survey participants felt 'no obligation' to stay informed.

On the other hand, findings show today's youth are more inclined to volunteer in a bid to give back.

Among six civic activities in the poll, volunteering was the only one that adults under 30 rated as highly as older people did.

'I want to make my city where I live a better place,' Morgan Gress, 24, of Washington said after sorting and hanging donated clothes with co-workers who chose to volunteer in lieu of an office holiday party. 

After you volunteer, she said, 'You never walk away feeling you didn't have a great time, or help someone out, or learn something new.'

Today's young adults grew up amid nudges from a volunteering infrastructure that has grown exponentially since their parents' day, when the message typically came through churches or scouting.

Gress doesn't find it unusual that her employer, a hub for tech startups called 1776, encouraged workers to sort clothes at Bread for the City during office hours.

Most of her friends work at companies with some sort of volunteer program, she says. 

Community service was required at her private high school in Buffalo, New York, like many other schools across the country. 

Volunteer opportunities were plentiful as a student at American University.

In the decades since President George H.W. Bush championed America's volunteer groups as 'a thousand points of light' at his 1989 inaugural, the number of nonprofits has skyrocketed. 

The Martin Luther King Jr. holiday and September 11 have become days of service. 

Individuals launch community projects through social media, instead of hanging posters and making phone calls.

Twenty percent of adults under 30 volunteered in 2013, up from 14 percent in 1989, according to census data analyzed by the Corporation for National and Community Service. 

It seems likely that the Millennials' volunteering rate will climb higher, because past generations have peaked in their 30s and 40s, when many parents give their time to schools, youth groups or community improvements.

'We're on the crux of something big, because these Millennials are going to take this spirit of giving and wanting to change communities and they're going to become parents soon,' said Wendy Spencer, CEO of the Corporation for National and Community Service. 

'I am very encouraged by what we're seeing.'

The vast majority of Americans believe citizenship comes with an array of responsibilities.

But the strength of that conviction has weakened since the General Social Survey asked about obligations of citizenship in 1984.

Seventy-seven percent say reporting a crime you witness is very important, down from 90 percent three decades ago in the survey conducted by NORC at the University of Chicago. 

Three-quarters call voting in elections very important, about the same as in the 1984 survey, though only about 36 percent of eligible voters cast ballots in November's midterms. 

Despite some experts hoping that volunteering will lead to a strong return to political participation and other civic virtues, Rutgers University Professor Cliff Zukin, who studies civic engagement, sees little prospect.

He believes interest was already waning well before today's young adults came of age.

'They're starting at a very, very low point,' he said. 'And each generation seems to have peaked at less than the previous generation.'

The poll of 1,044 young adults was conducted online July 24 to 28, 2014.
