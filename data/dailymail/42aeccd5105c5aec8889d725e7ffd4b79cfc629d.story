In a country as highly populated as China, examples of noteworthy driving are not difficult to find.

But while high speed crashes and overturned lorries are commonplace, the relatively innocuous act of parking a car  rarely makes the news.

But two incidents this month highlight the extremes of parking in China.

While one man was filmed effortlessly squeezing his large 4x4 into a space only a few inches larger than his vehicle, CCTV footage showed another  making a complete hash of reversing out of a parking bay - crashing into the neighbouring vehicle a staggering 15 times before speeding off.

Sublime: Without needing to correct his manoeuvre, Chen Zhongliang was able to reverse his large 4x4 into a space only inches larger than the car itself - making it appear purpose made for his vehicle

Ridiculous: The  driver in the second incident displayed a considerably less skilled parking technique

In the first incident, filmed in the city of Quanzhou in Fujian province, 31-year-old Chen Zhongliang was seen parking his bright orange Faw Besturn X80 in exceptional style.

Without needing to correct his manoeuvre, Mr Chen was able to reverse his large 4x4 into a space only inches larger than the car itself - making it appear purpose made for his vehicle.

The sublime parking had nothing to do with luck however, as the stone groove is actually outside Mr Chen's home, giving him plenty of opportunity to practice squeezing his car into the tiny gap.

The driver in the second incident displayed a considerably less rehearsed approach to parking.

Earning him the dubious accolade of the country’s 'worst driver', the unnamed man was caught on CCTV taking 10 minutes to simply reverse out of a parking bay.

While doing so he managed to hit the car next to him a staggering 15 times.

Ease: Chen Zhongliang's parking had nothing to do with luck, as the stone groove is actually right outside his home - giving him plenty of opportunity to practice squeezing his car into the tiny gap

Not a scratch: Mr Chen was able to park his large 4x4 in the tiny space in a single impressive manoeuvre

The footage, taken earlier this month in Jiangyin, a city of around two million people in the east of the country, shows the hapless man trying dozens of bizarre angles and manoeuvres to get out the bay.

Had he simply reversed backwards out of the space, he'd have avoided any bumps or scrapes. 

After eventually getting out of the parking space, the man was seen speeding away from the scene without making any effort to let the unfortunate driver of the neighbouring car know what he'd done.

He was later tracked down by police officers, who contacted local car dealers to find his identity.

Officers confiscated the man’s licence on suspicion of being involved in a hit and run, pending further penalty measures, according to the South China Morning Post.

The man, who had only been driving for two months, has been called 'reverse brother' by Chinese social media users

The man, who had only been driving for two months, has been called 'reverse brother' by Chinese social media users, who wondered how he passed the driving test in the first place.

'Did he buy the licence, or what?' one said. Bribing officials to obtain a licence is a common practice in China.

China’s roads are notoriously dangerous. 

According to the World Health Organisation around 200,000 people are killed in crashes every year - the leading causes of death for people between 14 and 44 years of age.

China has about 85 million passenger cars plying its roads, about 40 per cent fewer than in the United States. 

Yet 67,759 people died in road accidents in China in 2009 - more than double the number in the U.S.
