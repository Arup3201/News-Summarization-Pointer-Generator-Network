A fourth-grade teacher at Sandy Hook elementary school is being hailed as a hero for his quick thinking that likely saved his life and four others.

Ted Varga, 25, had been chatting with colleagues about a school concert when shots rang out last Friday morning.

Mr Varga managed to escape through an emergency exit but realizing that there were still co-workers in the building, returned and helped three people escape in Newtown, Connecticut.

Courage: Ted Varga, 25, escaped the shooting at Sandy Hook elementary school but went back into the building to help other teachers escape

Mr Varga told the New York Daily News that he was talking about the previous night’s choral performance with four other teachers in the conference room.

Principal Dawn Hochsprung popped in to offer them some chocolate. He said that she commented on his tie before leaving. Moments later, she would be gunned down.

Once the shooting began, Mr Varga tried to lock the door to the conference room. When he found out the door would not lock, the teacher then ran down a smoke-filled hallway to safety but turned back to help his fellow staff escape.

Once back in the conference room, Mr Varga helped dislodge a wooden board on one of the windows and three of the teachers escaped through the hole.

The fourth remained in the room, hiding behind a large pile of donated Christmas gifts, thinking the shooter would just move on.

‘If we didn’t leave when we did, we all would have died,' Mr Varga said.

All the fourth-graders in the five teachers’ classes survived the shooting. 

Mr Varga said that as gunshots echoed through the hallways, a custodian ran around, warning people. He appears to have survived; all the adults killed were women.

'He said, ''Guys! Get down! Hide!''' Mr Varga said. 'So he was actually a hero.'

In tribute: Hundreds of soft toys and Christmas presents have been left for the children who died

Overwhelming grief: Mourners gather for a moment's silence this morning at 9.30am to honor the victims of the Sandy Hook school shooting
