Oliver Hellowell's incredible photographs have already earned him an abundance of fans around the world, with his Facebook page gaining more than 53,000 'likes.'

The 18-year-old's mother Wendy O'Carroll believes it is her son's condition that allows him to see  the beauty in the world that the ordinary eye might miss.

Young snapper Oliver, from Somerset captured these stunning images, including this one of the incredibly still Loch Lairig in Eala Perthshire

Wendy, who lives with Oliver in Somerset, explained it was her son's attention to detail which helped to make his photography so striking.

She said: 'I think his success is clearly down to his story, as well as the quality of his images and his 'eye' for a picture.

'He enjoys taking pictures of 'pieces' of things or anything which really catches his eye- a yellow leaf on a dark background, water splashing at the edge of a waterfall, or ripples of water which catch the light.

'He will take pictures of almost anything that catches his eye.

Oliver's mother believes his condition means that her son sees the world differently from most people and gives a unique insight into capturing the natural world (pictured is River Morrow at Skenfrith Castle, Abergavenny, Wales)

Just over a year ago, mother Wendy O'Carroll (right) set up a Facebook page for the 18-year-old Oliver's photography which has been gaining in popularity

Oliver, pictured snapping a new set of shots with his camera, hopes that photography - particularly of birds - can become his full-time profession

'What he finds and sees as interesting or beautiful, is so frequently something which others may not, or which most of us walk straight past without even noticing.'

The youngster, who is well on his way to becoming a professional photographer, is now in the process of signing a book deal to showcase his images.

Wendy said her son particularly enjoyed taking photos of wild, country landscapes and has a particular affinity with birds which allows him to capture some incredible shots.

'He loves birds for example and will sit in a hide for periods of time to catch some good bird shots, and enjoys going to places like the ICBP in Newent where he can get close to the birds of prey and get some excellent close-up shots,' said his mother. 

His passion also allows him freedom as his Wendy claimed that his condition meant that all through his life he has been restricted far more than ordinary children and young people.

'When he is taking photographs he can take pictures of whatever he wants, without anyone saying 'don't do that' or 'don't go there' or 'let me do that for you' or 'no that's not right let me show you how,' she added.

'He has complete power over his subject matter, the time he spends on it and if he's happy with his picture then that's the most important thing.

'He can also take pictures which he knows other people will like and is pleased and proud to be able to 'show' those -so photography as well as bringing him more independence also brings him self-esteem and confidence.'

Oliver had his first exhibition in November 2012, and the talented photographer has gone onto display at several more, including an exhibition at Westonzoyland hall in Somerset.

Wendy hopes that others with Down's Syndrome, as well as aspiring photographers, will be inspired by Oliver's achievements.

'Hopefully they will think: 'Gosh if a young lad with Down 's Syndrome can do that with a camera imagine what I might be able to do?!'

'Several photographers find that they get ideas from Oliver's work and his unusual angles, and find themselves getting great images when they try something that they saw Oliver doing - so all in all, everyone's a winner!' adds Wendy.
