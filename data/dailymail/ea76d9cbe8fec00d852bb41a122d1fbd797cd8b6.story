A man whose wheelie bin was 'too heavy' to be emptied was stunned when a council worker told him to take his rubbish to the tip on a bus.

Father-of-one David Bridgman said he was given the astonishing instruction when he phoned Canterbury City Council to find out why binmen hadn't taken away his household rubbish.

After being told his bin could break the rubbish cart, he was astonished when the council worker informed him: 'You will have to get a bus.'

Astonishing answer: Father-of-one David Bridgman said he was given the astonishing instruction to take the bin on the bus when he phoned Canterbury City Council to find out why binmen hadn't taken away his household rubbish

Red-faced council bosses have since apologised to Mr Bridgman after admitting the comment was 'inappropriate'.

The 25-year-old, who lives with his pregnant girlfriend Hannah, 24, and their 22-month-old son Harley in Herne Bay, Kent, said: 'When I saw our wheelie bin hadn't been emptied I phoned the council to ask why and was told it was because our bin was too heavy and would break the dust cart.

'I said to the woman, well what do you suggest I do with the rubbish if they won't take it away and she told me the only thing I could do was take it myself to the local tip.

'My nearest tip is a mile-and-a-half away. I don't have a car, so I said to her the only way I could possibly get there was to get on the bus.

'She replied: 'Well, if needs must, you will have to get a bus.'

Unhappy customer: Mr Bridgman lives a nearly two miles from the dump and can't drive so he was shocked when the suggestion to take the bin on the bus was made

'I just laughed at her. No bus driver would let me on their bus with a wheelie bin. And if the wheelie bin was too heavy for the binmen to empty, then how did she think I was going to take it with me on a bus to the tip?

'I couldn't believe it. What planet is this woman living on? What she was suggesting is so ridiculous I find it funny.'

Canterbury City Council says it operates fortnightly collections for household waste, but is unable to empty wheelie bins that are too heavy for binmen to lift.

Mr Bridgman, an unemployed carpet fitter, said: 'I told the woman on the phone there was no way I could get the rubbish to the tip and she had to arrange for someone to come round and collect it.

'I phoned back another three times that day to see what they were doing about it, but got nowhere.

'Then the next morning I woke up to find some purple sacks and been stuffed through our letter box with a leaflet saying I'd have to take our rubbish out of the wheelie bin, put it in these purple sacks and leave them out the front of the house until the next collection.

'I can't believe they expect us to leave our rubbish on the street for two weeks. There are dirty nappies and old food in the rubbish - we'll be getting maggots, rats and all sorts.

'I'm really not happy, but I don't know what else I can do.'

Larissa Laing, the council's head of neighbourhood services, said: 'We're sorry if Mr Bridgman feels that he was spoken to inappropriately and that his situation was not taken seriously when he called about his bin not being emptied.

'I have spoken to Mr Bridgman today and arrangements have been made to take away all of his rubbish tomorrow.'
