Back in 1996, when Warner Bros released its alien basketball film Space Jam, the studio created a website for fans to learn more about the movie. 

Almost 20 years on, this retro and headache-inducing site is still live, and is among a host of retro websites that are gaining a cult following.

Other pages that serve as time capsules for the web’s past include CNN’s 1996 OJ Simpson coverage, and the oldest continuously running webcam in San Francisco that went live in 1994.

The archive includes pages showcasing 1996 film Space Jam (pictured), as well as a site promoting Warner Bros You’ve Got Mail film from 1998. It also features news coverage of the 1996 OJ Simpson trial and the oldest continuously running webcam in San Francisco that went live in 1994

Many are stored on the Internet Archive’s Wayback Machine, that logs obscure and archived websites, software and video.

The site features more than 240 billion pages, and people are encouraged to save sites to the archive for prosperity in years to come.

The internet archive is part of a growing trend known as ‘digital archaeology.’

Earlier this year, the Barbican in London held an exhibition for retro childhood games and websites.

Video games and computers from the 1970s to 1990s including Space Invaders, Pong, the Gameboy, Mac Paint and the Linn LM-1 drum machine were all on display.

All the models were in working condition and were available to play as part of the exhibition, which tracked their respective places in technological history.

Other examples included Manic Miner on the ZX Spectrum and the first website to be created by pioneer Tim Berners-Lee in 1991.

The Digital Revolution exhibition was designed as a 'celebration of digital creativity.'

In May last year, researchers restored the first website, created by Mr Berners-Lee during his time at the European Organization for Nuclear Research, known as CERN.

The 1996 Space Jam website shows the film’s logo on a background of stars.

It reveals behind-the-scenes information about the cast and crew, audio from the film and includes a bio of lead star Michael Jordan.

The OJ Simpson coverage, from CNN, features headings that provide details about the witnesses, the suspects, evidence and the murder - all illustrated using Clip Art.

In 1994, a webcam was installed at San Francisco State University to monitor fog in the region, as part of a student project.

The camera is still live, and still streams footage, 24 hours a day.

Another interactive Warner Bros site was created in 1998 to promote You’ve Got Mail, starring Tom Hanks and Meg Ryan.

It lets users read the emails between the two characters, using a virtual inbox, and an instant messenger pop-up details other dialogue from the film.

There is even a Washington Post archive from 1996 in which the Macarena dance was featured in its In Style section.

This was the year that Post.com launched, which the site explained: 'The nation embraced the internet as a new method of communicating, and The Washington Post began publishing on the Web in June with the launch of WashingtonPost.com.

'We asked you to ".com and get it," and you do, to the tune of a half-million page views a day. Stick around - there’s more to come in 1997.'

Meanwhile, a Robert De Niro fan page has survived for more 15 years since it launched in 1999 (pictured). Many of these retro sites are stored on the Internet Archive’s Wayback Machine, which logs obscure and archived websites, software and video links

Meanwhile, a Robert De Niro fan page has survived for more 15 years since it launched in 1999.

And it appears that internet trolls aren’t new either. 

In 1995, following Microsoft’s launch of Internet Explorer, one disgruntled customer set up a site calling the software ‘evil’ and showing then-boss Bill Gates with horns. 

Alternatively, a Pop Tart fan launched a website in 1994 providing a step-by-step guide on how to turn a toaster into a blow torch using the strawberry-flavoured snack. 

There is even a Washington Post archive (pictured) from 1996 in which the Macarena dance was featured in its In Style section. It also details Bill Clinton returning to office for a second term, and Post.com launched

Before Barack Obama was elected president in 2008, he campaigned to be a senator for Illinois. 

His 2004 campaign website is still live, complete with photos and a thank you post to those who voted him in.
