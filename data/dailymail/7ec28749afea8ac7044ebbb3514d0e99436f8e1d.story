A driver has been fined after leaving his car unattended – so he could collect a parking permit.

James Maloney stopped outside his parents’ home in Liverpool and went inside to pick up their visitors’ permit.

But when the 34-year-old returned moments later, he found a ticket on his windscreen – which showed an ‘observation period’ of just 12 seconds.

He said: ‘Quite how someone is supposed to display a permit without getting out of their car to get it from the householder is beyond me.’

The photographer, who received the fine on September 18, added: ‘I imagine that Usain Bolt would have trouble getting in and out of the house quick enough to display a valid permit within 12 seconds.’

A spokesman for Liverpool Council said that residents have in the past asked for ‘more robust’ policing of the area, and ‘contraventions are penalised to reflect this’.

He added that the ‘observation period’ referred to the time taken for a warden to print the notice, and that officers were in the street for ten minutes.

The council said any motorist could appeal against the decision. Mr Maloney said: 'The fine doesn't bother me. It's more the principle. 

'I am more than happy to donate the full amount of the fine to a charity of Mayor Joe Anderson's choice if the council decides to exercise a bit of common sense on this occasion.'
