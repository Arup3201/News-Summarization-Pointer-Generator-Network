Paris is resorting to the emergency measure of making all public transport free in an attempt to deal with a smog problem that shrouded its famous skyline a murky veil.

Nearly three-quarters of France is under alert in what the European Environment Agency says is the worst air pollution since 2007.

Subways, buses and trains are free from today until the end of Sunday in the entire Paris region, as well as in the cities of Caen and Rouen.

Bike-shares are also free, as are one-hour sessions for electric car shares.

Pollution in Paris has become so severe that it has brought a thick layer of smog down on the city

While the pollution readings are not an all-time high for the city, meteorologists say unusually warm days followed by cool nights have worsened the situation.

An environmental group brought a complaint earlier this week denouncing the 'inertia of the government' that it says has put lives in danger.

Airparif, an organisation that was founded in 1979 to monitor the air quality of Paris, ranks the current levels of pollution as 'very high', the most severe ranking on its scale.

After a spike in pollution readings in December, Parisian authorities took decisive action by lower the speed limits for some vehicles and banning large trucks from entering the city altogether. However, this has not been enough to reverse the problem.

Smog is becoming an increasing issue around the globe but it has been plaguing Chinese cities for years.

The problem has become so severe in Beijing that some scientists have likened its effects to that of a nuclear winter.

Authorities are reporting the current situation as the city's worst pollution event since 2007

Pollution in the Chinese capital can become so severe that planes are unable to fly and authorities are forced to shut down roads. This is on top of the real dangers it poses to the health of residents.

The maximum safe level of PM 2.5 particles - pollution parties which are small enough to be absorbed into the bloodstream - is accepted as 25 micrograms per cublic metre but Beijing has been known to see its readings exceed 500.

The Chinese government, which already uses planes to try and disperse pollution, has started testing unmanned drones as a tool to try and save its cities from smog.

Other French cities, including Lille, pictured, are struggling with their own smog problems
