A dog walker has survived after plunging more than 100ft down a sheer cliff face while walking her pets at a beauty spot.

The 47-year-old had been walking along the clifftops at Hengistbury Head near Christchurch, Dorset, when she slipped and fell, possibly while chasing after one of her dogs. 

Emergency rescue teams deployed to the headland at the mouth of Christchurch Harbour were amazed to find the woman alive and conscious, leaning against a rock at the bottom of the cliff.

A dog walker has survived after plunging more than 100ft down a sheer cliff face while walking her pets at Hengistbury Head near Christchurch, Dorset

The 47-year-old had been walking along the clifftops at Hengistbury Head near Christchurch, Dorset, when she slipped and fell, possibly while chasing after one of her dogs

She suffered back injuries in the 100ft fall and was placed on a spinal board before being airlifted off the beach by coastguard helicopter.

Coastguards today said it was an 'absolute miracle' that the unnamed woman was not killed.

The woman, who is thought to live in the Christchurch area, was flown to Southampton Hospital, Hampshire and was today said to be in a critical but stable condition.

The woman had fallen 100ft from the top of this cliff

A member of her family arrived soon after the rescue at 12.45pm yesterday to collect her dogs from the top of the cliff, close to the site of an old coastguard lookout hut. 

'The lady was walking her two dogs along the clifftop at 11.30am at Hengistbury Head close to an old coastguard lookout building when she fell over the side,' said a spokesman for the Mudeford lifeboat crew, which was first on the scene.

'We have no idea yet how she came to fall over the cliff - she might have been going after one of her dogs, but we don't know.

'She fell around 100ft to the bottom of the cliffs. Luckily a member of the public saw her fall and called 999 straight away.

'Our lifeboat crew were on the scene within a few minutes and we found her conscious, sat up against a rock at the foot of the cliff.

'Three of our team went ashore to administer first aid. Amazingly it appeared she had only hurt her back.

'Very soon after a team of coastguards from Southbourne arrived and then the coastguard helicopter. The lady was then airlifted to hospital in Southampton.

'We initially called the RSPCA to look after the dogs but then a family member arrived to take them, which would suggest she was local.

'It is an absolute miracle that she survived the fall, let alone escape just with back injuries.

'It could have been so much worse.'

Pete Dadds, a member of the RNLI crew, added: 'There are not many people that can survive a tumble down a 100ft cliff.'

The fall has prompted coastguards to issue a warning to walkers, urging them to take care on coastal paths and stay well clear of cliff edges.

Peter Davies, from HM Coastguard, said: 'If you are going to the coast this half-term please take care along cliffs and coastal footpaths.

'The gradient at which cliffs fall away from the paths can be deceptive and following wet weather some cliff edges may be slippery or unstable.

'If you do spot someone in difficulty along the coast call 999 and ask for the Coastguard.'

A spokesman for Dorset Police said the incident was not being treated as suspicious.
