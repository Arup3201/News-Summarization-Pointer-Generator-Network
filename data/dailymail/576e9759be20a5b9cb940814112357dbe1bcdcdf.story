An Indian man has become the world’s oldest father for the second time at the age of 96.

Ramjit Raghav was awarded the title two years ago when he had his first born son Karamjit aged 94.

Although he swore one was enough, the pensioner and his wife Shakuntala, 54, welcomed another son Ranjit, last month.

Speaking at his home in the state of Haryana, 31 miles from Delhi, Ramjit said: ‘What can I do? This is all God's wish. He wanted me to have another son.’

When Shakuntala gave birth to the healthy boy earlier this month at the Government hospital in Haryana, the doctors laughed when Ramjit said he was the father.

He said: ‘They just laughed but they were very surprised.’

Ramjit, who lives with his family in a studio apartment, has high hopes for his sons.

He said: ‘I have been a farmer all my life. But I want them to become high ranking government workers.

‘It's good that I have another son now. Even if one of them dies, God forbid, I will have someone to carry on my family name."

Ramjit admits that as proud as he is of having two healthy sons at his age, his neighbours are more jealous of his sex drive.

He
 said: ‘I do it three or four times a night. My neighbours are jealous 
and they keep asking me for my secret but all I tell them is that it is 
God's will.

‘I'm 
healthy and I enjoy sex with my wife. I think it's very important for a 
husband and wife to have sex regularly and when she asks I will go on 
all night but for the sake of my child I've put our needs aside for 
now.'

Father-of-two Ramjit claims that a daily diet of almonds, butter and milk kept him sexually active.

He said: ‘I care for my wife and I give her everything she needs. She is a very happy woman.'

When Ramjit met second wife Shakuntala, he had been a widower for 25 years.

The pair met 22 years ago on a rainy morning at a Muslim shrine, Ramjit asked her to come home with him and she has never left.

'She didn't have any family or friends around, and I wanted to help her,' he explains.

'I
 took her under my wing and taught her some yoga and we fell in love. 
Many of my past girlfriends had died so I had never married and then I 
asked Shakuntala to be my wife.'

Shakuntala believes she would have been dead by now if it was not for Ramjit's caring ways.

She said: ‘It doesn't matter how old he is, I love him and I care for him dearly even, though he shouts at me sometimes.

‘He
 doesn't seem old to me, he can make love like any 25-year-old man, even
 better because he can go on all night, and he makes a wonderful 
father.’
