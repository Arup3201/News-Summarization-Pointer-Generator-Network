An inventive photographer managed to snap a series of spectacular images of historic Cambridge from the air by strapping a camera - to a kite.

Bill Blake, 52, had always taken photos in his role as a surveyor and tried to think of a way to take aerial pictures without spending a fortune.

After a brain wave he went out and bought a lightweight camera and stunt kite, then rigged up his own eye in the sky.

Bill said he had been delighted with the snaps he has managed to take thanks to rekindling his boyhood love of kite-flying.

He said: ‘I have been a keen kite flyer since I was a lad. As soon as I realised I could combine it with photography I found a new interest in kite flying.’

Surprised by the quality of his results, Bill started taking more pictures in his spare time and has now turned his creative idea into a regular hobby.

Among the beautiful images he has been able to capture are shots of the Fitzwilliam Museum and the Mullard Radio Astronomy Observatory in Cambridge.

He uses a large three square metre kite attached to him by a harness with a camera fastened to the line taking the stunning aerial photographs.

His mini light weight Leica X1 camera is controlled via a radio on the ground.

The father-of-two, who lives with his wife Anne, 33, in Cambridge, said: ‘The process is a simple idea. Photographers used balloons and kites to raise cameras before aircrafts were invented.

‘The camera has to be light so it does not get blown about too much. I can walk left and right, but I cannot completely control the camera position from the ground.

‘I need a lot of open space to take the images - that is why windmills are some of my favourite buildings to capture.

‘I have revisited my childhood love of kites. There was a huge craze for kites in the 1970s.

‘Maybe it is something of a middle aged man thing.

‘I started four years ago and have been inspired by other kite photographers. I decided this year that I wanted to get these pictures seen.’

Bill will go on show at All Saints Church, Cambridge, for a week from Saturday.
