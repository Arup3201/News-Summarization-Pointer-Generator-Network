Manchester United haven't made a flying start to life under Louis van Gaal, but that hasn't stopped some of his players from attempting to soar high.

Judged by club vice-captain Darren Fletcher, nine of his Red Devils team-mates - including Angel di Maria, Ander Herrera and Michael Carrick - took part in a three-minute painting challenge where they had to replicate the look of a toy model Russian Aeroflot plane.

The 'artistic' trio competed against the efforts of David de Gea, Ashley Young, Anderson, Ben Amos, James Wilson and Jesse Lingard with the nine players all producing mixed results on the canvas.

The players were judged by team-mate and club vice-captain Darren Fletcher

Much maligned midfielder Anderson's form on-the-pitch was duplicated off it with Fletcher far from impressed with his painting, while summer signing Herrera pipped Carrick and Di Maria to winning first prize.

While the players were in a jovial mood as they attempted the challenge, they will be looking to get back to serious matters when they travel to London to face Arsenal in the Premier League on Saturday evening.

Victory for the Old Trafford outfit would see them leapfrog Arsenal in the table - with both clubs languishing 12 and 13 points behind runaway league leaders Chelsea after 11 matches of the season so far.

Herrera won the competition ahead of Carrick and Di Maria who came second and third respectively

Jesse Lingard's effort was one of the worst paintings from the nine members of the Red Devils squad
