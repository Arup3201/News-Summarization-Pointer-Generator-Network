A World War II veteran facing eviction by his own daughter from his home of 56 years has avoided being forced out after generous strangers raised thousands of dollars online so he could buy it back.

John Potter, 92, and his granddaughter, Jaclyn Fraley, 35, collected nearly $140,000 on a GoFundMe.com page and his daughter has finally accepted a payout after rejecting initial offers.

Janice Cottrill and husband Dean tried to kick him out of the home in Zaleski, Ohio after they overtook general power of attorney from Potter and his now-deceased wife.

Fraley said the fallout was exacerbated when her grandfather and mother argued over visitation rights for Mr Potter's autistic son, Joe after Mrs Cottrill took over his care in 2008.

Staying put: He faced being evicted from his home in Zaleski, Ohio, which he had built 56 years ago

The deal came at the eleventh hour for the elderly man, who was to hear his fate at an eviction hearing at Vinton County Courthouse in October.

But Fraley told ABC News that the court has been notified that paperwork was filed to dismiss the eviction. She said she 'shrieked for 10 seconds and starting bawling' when she heard the news.

Her grandfather added: 'I want to express my appreciation for all those people who helped me. It wasn't one person, it wasn't a hundred but over five thousand people and I certainly appreciate it more than they will ever know.

'I had this house for over 50 years 
before this took place...
I have worried all day every day ever since and now I am so happy I 
don't have to worry about it anymore.'

Battle: The duo took the problem to GoFundMe.com, where they raised $140,000 through donations

Potter must now wait for the deed to be prepared and for the paperwork to be signed by the couple. Fraley said she will then present them with a check.

'Janice and Dean agreed to sell back Grandpa's house!' Fraley wrote on the GoFundMe page on Friday. 'This has been the longest and hardest fight of our lives and it is finally over! Grandpa can spend the rest of his life in the home he built to spend it in!!!!!!'

Fraley did not say how much they agreed to take for the house, but said that it was 'five figures' and that all remaining money would go to her grandfather's care and to items for his home.

The last rejected offer was about $60,000.

The ordeal began in 2004 when Mr 
Potter was battling a serious illness when he handed his general power 
of attorney rights to Cottrill. Since then, his wife has passed away.

Unbeknownst
to Mr Potter, his daughter allegedly used that power to convey the deed to the one-story, 
three-bedroom home he built 56-years ago to herself.

Ms Cottrill has not said why she is so insistent about kicking her own father out of the house he built.

Thankful: He said he appreciated the outpouring of support and he was grateful he no longer had to worry

'To me the situation is just so heartbreaking,' Fraley told ABC.

Mr Potter says appraisers told him the home was worth just less than $50,000 - far less than he thought.

Mr Potter said his first offer to buy
the home for appraised value was greeted with a counter offer for 
$85,000 - plus $4,000 in eviction fees and $11,500 in attorney fees.

Mr Potter raised the offer to $66,000 on June 13, but never heard back from his daughter.

‘I laid awake at night trying to figure 
out what in the world I could have done to these people to make them so 
angry at me,’ he told a local TV station earlier this year.

He didn't want to agree to his 
daughter's demands because he didn't want to give her more money than 
the house is worth, he said.

Earlier this year, Mr Potter said he was 'amazed' by the more than 5,000 people who donated toward his original $125,000 goal.

'I never knew people could love an old man so much,' he told his granddaughter.

After Mr Potter's daughter sent him an eviction notice earlier this year, Ms Fraley organized the desperate fundraiser for him in April while sharing with the public his dire situation.

Donations immediately poured in from 
around the world from those touched by the military veteran in Zaleski, 
Ohio whom they too called 'grandpa.'

'When
I got out of the army and got on my feet on the ground, I rented a 
power shovel and dug a hole in the ground, built a basement and built a 
house on top of it,' he told ABC of the home.

Fraley hasn’t spoken to her mother and 
stepfather in two years since she learned about their plan to sell her 
grandfather's home and place him in a nursing home.

Mr Potter has already attempted to 
sue to get his home back, arguing that his daughter had transferred the 
deed to herself illegally.

He
initially won a county court ruling, but last year an appeals court 
ruled that because the statute of limitations of four years had passed 
on the accusation of fraud the deed could not be handed back to Mr 
Potter.
