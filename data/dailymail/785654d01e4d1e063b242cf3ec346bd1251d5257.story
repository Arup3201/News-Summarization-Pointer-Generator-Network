They eat three full meals a day, drink from a cup, they've grown teeth and can walk and talk, but these three-year-old triplets are still breastfed by their mother once or twice a day. 

Davina Wright, 45, has been breastfeeding her triplets - Willow, Connor and Summer - since they were born and will continue as long as she is physically capable. 

Ms Wright, who lives in Hong Kong with her husband Jason, was doing 30-40 feeds a day when their two daughters and son were first born but has since scaled back to just morning and night.

'They each have their own room and I go in to each of them individually and it is a lovely bit of one-on-one time,' Ms Wright told Daily Mail Australia.

'At three years old they are basically just fed to sleep, not that they actually fall asleep, it's more like 'fed to calm/sleepy'. 

'In reality it is only about 10-15 minutes of their day, their hectic, chaotic, loud, busy, competitive, triplet day, where they get to sit quietly by themselves with mummy.'

Ms Wright also breastfeeds first thing in the morning and she says the three toddlers are highly competitive as they fuss over who has to wait to be nursed.

'My kids walk and talk and eat solid food and drink from a cup and are independent and have a full set of teeth... all the things that people point out as reasons for weaning, but in actuality a child can do all these things and still be breastfed,' she said.

The three toddlers can be highly competitive as they fuss over who waits to be nursed, according to Ms Wright

'I think the weaning down of feeds during the day was partly because we got so busy… there was play and stimulation and they just asked for it less.

'I really only say no to them now... when we are out in public. I say that we will wait until we are home for that now, simply because I am aware of how many eyes are on us.'

The Wrights, who lived in New Zealand when the triplets were born, tried several plans before finally working out how to breastfeed three hungry mouths and still manage to sleep. 

'We finally settled on (Jason) sleeping in the nursery with the two girls and bottle feeding them my breast milk at night,' she said. 

'I would sleep in our bedroom with the third one and breastfeed him. Then after every feed I would pump the breast milk, which became the next nights feeding for the girls.

Davina and her husband Jason gave birth to triplets after two rounds of IVF when they lived in New Zealand

'As they got older they got much quicker at feeding and instead of 30-40 minutes, they would be done in 15-20, and then as they got older it still only takes 10 minutes.'

Ms Wright, who has two adult daughters from her first marriage, breastfed them until they self-weaned at 13 months. 

'I set myself the goal of two years with the triplets, not fully sure that we would get that far, and definitely not thinking we would still be going at three years old,' she said.

'But they are still happy with it and I am still happy with it and it works for our family so we keep going.

Ms Wright used to feed 30-40 times a day when the triplets were newborns. But she has since cut scaled back to just twice a day

Ms Wright says a breastfeeding relationship is between a mother and child and they are the only people who should have a say in how long it continues

'It has been everything to their lives, it has slowly changed to being a very small part of their lives, and one day it will be a distant memory in their lives. 

'A breastfeeding relationship is between a mother and child and they are the only people who should have a say in how long it continues. The beauty being that every mother gets to decide for herself.'

'I know that extended, or natural-term breastfeeding isn't for everyone, and that is okay. I would say to people if it's not for you then don't do it, simple as that.'
