Brazil need to start playing with their heads and not with their hearts.

Against Chile they seemed to allow the emotion and pressure of the situation affect their football, they looked to be strangled by fear.

I know they’re not a typical Brazilian team of the past - with all the tricks and samba skills - but the amount of long balls on Saturday evening, along with the lack of organisation defensively, meant they were not too difficult to play against. Colombia will have taken note.

Use your head: Jamie Carragher says Brazil must control their emotions if they are to win the World Cup

You see it in their play. I’ve never seen a Brazil team play so directly before and the tension definitely affected them against Chile.

Their opponents on Friday, Colombia, will not approach the game with any concern. They have to stop Neymar, yes, but they will fancy their chances.

They will come into the game with confidence and they will believe they can beat the hosts.

Brazil need more organisation and control of their emotions as only Neymar has that typical Brazilian X-factor we have seen in their teams over the years.

Do they look hard to beat? Not right now.

Fred and Hulk are obviously valued by the manager, Luiz Felipe Scolari, and I’m sure they give something to the team, but we’ve yet to see the evidence.

Oscar, a gifted player for Chelsea, played well in the first game against Croatia, scoring the thirdgoal, but he has drifted and was on the fringes of the following matches. I’d like to see his Stamford Bridge team-mate Willian come in to add more energy and power.

The supporters’ role has been huge and I think they dragged the team to penalties against Chile, as they looked drained.

When a team and the crowd come together like that it can feel unstoppable for a player.

I have witnessed it at Anfield on those big Champions League nights. I can remember Liverpool making fast starts — scoring early against Chelsea in 2005 and 2007, Juventus in 2005, Real Madrid in 2009, feeding off the crowd.

You can’t play like that for 90 minutes, but they influenced the results and the performance in a positive way. It’s not always the case, however. Jose Mourinho was the Chelsea manager in those Champions League games and, during Soccer Aid recently, I spoke to him about this very subject.

We talked about the game at Anfield last season when Chelsea won and effectively ended Liverpool’s chance of winning the title.

Until that point, it looked as if Liverpool would be champions.

Jose said he felt Liverpool were too emotional that day, too hyped up. He cited players tryingto wrestle the ball off him on the touchline after ten minutes.

He said they became desperate and were shooting and crossing from stupid angles.

I saw similar signs of such desperation in Brazil’s play on Saturday. When the emotion cascades down from the crowd, the players need to show cool heads.

Right now, they are too wrapped up in the passion as the host nation.

I know they want to avenge the 1950 tournament where they lost to Uruguay at home, which istotally understandable. 

But the head has to overrule the heart. After the Chile victory, there were scenes with Neymar crying and Scolari looking close to the same reaction — but it was a last-16 game, not a semi-final or a final!

Danger: Colombia's James Rodriguez will pose a threat to Brazil having scored five World Cup five goals so far

They need to get themselves in check because there is a long way for them to go if they are towin this and more emotional examinations.

They have not yet put in a top-class performance in four games — if it continues they will come unstuck, possibly on Friday when James Rodriguez, who has been brilliant, and his team arrive.

Watching the Brazilian players sing their national anthem has been the most inspiring thing for me in this tournament, but the emotion in that - the build-up and atmosphere around the games as the hosts and favourites - can be very draining.

They need to deal with that better than we have seen so far or they will be out.
