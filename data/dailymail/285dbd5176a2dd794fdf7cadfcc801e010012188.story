Cyclists were left baffled after they were given an apparent bike path just four inches wide.

The bizarre white line was supposed to mark out a 'shared pavement' between walkers and cyclists in Grimsby, Lincolnshire - but it left even councillors scratching their heads.

Residents thought they would have to ride along a four-inch gap between the thick white line and the kerb, a daunting task for even the most experienced cyclist.

Baffling: Cyclists complained after it appeared council workers had painted a path for them four inches wide

Cyclist Ray Lawrance, 61, spotted the white line as he walked his two grandchildren to school.

He said: 'As a layman looking at this, I am totally confused. Where is the cycle path, where is the pedestrian path? There's no clear definition which is which.

'It
is pointless. It does not appear to be the best use of public money. It
is probably to tick boxes to get a bit of central government funding 
but it has left pedestrians and cyclists confused.'

The line was painted last month on a residential street in the village of Great Coates, on the outskirts of Grimsby, as part of resurfacing work at a busy junction.

Labour-controlled North East Lincolnshire Council insisted its intention was to mark out a shared space for cyclists and pedestrians, not to divide the path in two.

A spokesman said: 'This is a commonly used marking to show where a cycle 
path joins a footpath. Cyclists and pedestrians share the length of path
marked by the white line.'

But Labour councillor Cliff Barber was forced to hold his hands up after the issue was raised at a community meeting on October 30.

The path had been resurfaced following complaints from the public,' he said. 'It
was a very uneven surface with lots of holes in so they have completely
re-tarmacked it and they have done a good job, but I must admit the 
newly painted line does look a bit narrow.'

The council insisted the repainting was essential for the pavement, but declined to say whether they will change the original markings.

Vic Goose, chairman of the North East Lincolnshire Cycle Forum, said: 'The cycle path has been there for some time and has always been a shared path.

'It is quite likely that the white line is to segregate the cycle path from the road.'

The bizarre incident is certainly not the first questionable paint job by council workers.

Contractors for Cumbria County Council last month painted the words KEEP CEEAR in huge white letters - before having to apologise and correct it for free.

And workmen in Thatcham, Berkshire, were a laughing stock when they refused to let parked cars stop them doing their job - and simply painted double yellow lines between each one.
