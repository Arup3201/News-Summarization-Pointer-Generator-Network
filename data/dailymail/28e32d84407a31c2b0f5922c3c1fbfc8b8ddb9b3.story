This striking video shows the moment a rare albino deer is captured on camera as it strolls around a park in Minnesota. 

The deer was spotted by an amateur wildlife photographer in Father Hennepin State Park located on the southeast corner of Mille Lacs Lake.

And the stark white animal is such a rare deer that some experts suggest that only one in 20,000 are born.

The photographer told Jukin Media: 'We occasionally drive through the park after work in hopes of seeing a white deer.

'On Friday, November 14, 2014, as we entered the park, the deer were there and we captured this clip.'

It can be difficult to spot a white deer when there is heavy snow, and even more rare to see an albino deer in the wild.

Sadly, the beautiful animals rarely live to adulthood because predators can spot them so easily, making them easy prey. 

They also suffer from very poor eyesight.

They are the incredibly striking animals with a coat of white fur and even a white tail. 

The White deer's color is passed on as a genetic trait.

And the animals are extremely rare.

Wisconsin naturalist John Bates, co-author of 'White Deer: Ghosts of the Forest,' said albino deer are born once in about 20,000 births. 

However, some biologists claim only one in 100,000 deer is born albino, the report said.

Any white deer that lacks all color pigments are called 'true albinos.'

The animals are typically identified by their pink nose and eyes–the result of blood vessels showing through the skin and clear lens of the eyes.

Deer that have normal eyes and nose but a white coat color are referred to as 'white deer.'  

Seneca County, New York has one of the largest herds of white deer. 

The White pigmented white-tailed deer live in what is known as the Conservation Area of the former Seneca Army Depot.

The army gave the white deer protection while managing the normal-colored deer through hunting. 

Another population of white deer live near Boulder Junction in north central Wisconsin, with smaller populations in Manitowish Waters and Land O’ Lakes (all in Vilas County). 

These deer are also protected.

Historical records suggest that white deer may have lived in the Boulder Junction area since the earliest years of white settlement.
