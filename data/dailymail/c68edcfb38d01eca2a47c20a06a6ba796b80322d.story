Tottenham boss Mauricio Pochettino has been given the go-ahead to start an overhaul of his squad next month.

Five months into the new season, Pochettino remains unconvinced by a number of the players he inherited when he arrived from Southampton in the summer.

Sportsmail understands the club are preparing for one of the busiest January transfer windows in their history with Pochettino and chairman Daniel Levy determined to take serious steps to revamp the squad next month. Spurs’ run of three wins in a row came to an end on Wednesday in a 3-0 defeat at Chelsea.

Despite the result, Spurs are showing signs they are starting to come round to Pochettino’s high-pressing tactics — even though, Sportsmail understands, certain players have privately questioned his decision to axe Roberto Soldado for the Stamford Bridge encounter given that the striker’s re-introduction to the starting XI had coincided with three victories.

Pochettino and his backroom team have been busy using their contacts in Spain to identify potential targets in January.

Espanyol defender Hector Moreno, who the Argentine manager worked with before, is a player firmly on Pochettino’s radar even though he is recovering from a broken leg. 

Barcelona youngsters Sergi Samper and Adama Traore are also being watched. Tottenham will also bid to sign Southampton forward Jay Rodriguez.

However, there will be players on their way out too with the club willing to listen to offers for Paulinho, Vlad Chiriches, Aaron Lennon and Andros Townsend next month. 

The futures of Mousa Dembele, Emmanuel Adebayor and Jan Vertonghen also remain uncertain.
