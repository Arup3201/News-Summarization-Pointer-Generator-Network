He’s not been in charge 24 hours, but West Brom are already showing the standard Tony Pulis qualities.

Fight, grit and stubbornness; it was like Pulis had been in charge for years as the Baggies produced a gutsy display to hold West Ham to a draw at Upton Park.

Perhaps, under sacked Alan Irvine, this West Brom side would have crumbled after going behind after 10 minutes to Diafra Sakho’s header. No such chance with Pulis at the helm, Saido Berahino securing a valuable point for the Midlands club.

West Ham's Diafra Sakho has scored eight goals from just 14 shots on target in the Premier League since arriving last summer.

The Welshman's appointment as Irvine’s successor was confirmed on Thursday morning, and Pulis, who has been out of football since leaving Crystal Palace in August, wasted no time getting into the swing of things.

Pulis, together with his assistant David Kemp, were in situ in the stands well before kick-off as they started the process of trying to safeguard their record of never being relegated.

Keith Downing and Rob Kelly were on the touchline for the Baggies, but there was no escaping Pulis’ presence.

‘I’m sure it (Pulis’ presence) had an effect,’ admitted coach Kelly.

‘He introduced himself to the players this morning, he popped in at half time and after the game as well.

‘But he let us get on with it today. Anyone who knows Alan [Irvine] knows how organised he is, so we had an outline and we did most of the work on the team with Alan.

‘Tony and David [Kemp] let us get on with the organisation. He [Kemp] came down to the touchline with one or two suggestions.

‘But the players are very professional so all the preparation was done beforehand.’

Pulis, however, was powerless as he watched his new side fall behind as Sakho glanced home Aaron Cresswell’s cross from the left after an excellent Hammers move.

Ben Foster prevented the visitors from falling further behind just two minutes later, saving Stewart Downing’s fierce effort after the former Liverpool forward tormented Gareth McAuley.

It was just the start Sam Allardyce was after following two consecutive losses, albeit against Chelsea and Arsenal.

However, WBA could have drawn level in the 23rd minute with what would have been one of the goals of the season.

Chris Baird directed a brilliant first-time volley from Youssouf Mulumbu’s cross straight towards the top left-hand corner, only for Adrian to deny him with an excellent one-handed stop.

Pulis was taking note, gesturing to Kemp and chairman Jeremy Peace at regular intervals; though he wouldn’t have been impressed by Stephane Sessegnon’s finishing in the 26th minute as the forward fired wide from a good position.

However, he would have been heartened with the way the Baggies fought back into the encounter after their dismal start.

West Ham hadn’t pushed on following their early opener. Indeed, Allardyce admitted after the game that his side were feeling the impact of playing three games in six days.

Allardyce cut an anxious figure in his technical area, he had reason to be, too. In true Pulis style, West Brom were making life terribly uncomfortable for the hosts.

And in the 42nd minute, they were level after a rapid counter attack which saw Sessegnon travel half the length of the pitch before locating the unmarked Berahino, who cooly fired past Adrian.

The move had Pulis applauding; tangible evidence that in Berahino, he has a bona-fide Premier League goalscorer.

And the striker picked up where he left off as the second-half got underway, his deflected shot from the edge of the box well saved by Adrian.

Mulumbu, two minutes later, had the visiting fans celebrating, rippling the net with a fierce angled shot – but the effort actually hit the side-netting.

After their quickfire start, West Ham were on the ropes.

Allardyce threw on Matt Jarvis in place of Morgan Amalfitano in an attempt to re-invigorate his team and the move nearly paid instant dividends as the impressive Cresswell hit the post with a superbly executed 25-yard free-kick.

With 30 minutes left to play, Kemp made his way down to the dug-out to pass on instructions to Downing and Kelly.

If there was any doubt, the Pulis era was already in full swing.

Had Sakho, who moments later limped off with a back problem that leaves his place in Senegal’s Africa Cup of Nations squad in doubt, converted Downing’s low cross then Pulis would have needed to devise a new game plan.

But the Baggies were defending doggedly, Joleon Lescott and McAuley pillars of strength in the heart of their back four.

In the end, West Brom held on, pretty comfortably, for a point as the home side were booed off.

It seems Pulis is already working his magic.
