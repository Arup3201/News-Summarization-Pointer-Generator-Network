Thieves have stolen charity money collected to fund surgery so a two-year-old girl can walk.

Around £500 in cash was taken from stalls at a family fun day held to raise money for an operation to enable cerebral palsy sufferer Sophie Thomlinson to take her first steps.

She had been denied NHS funding for the selective dorsal rhizotomy procedure at Leeds General Infirmary and her family were faced with raising a minimum of £25,000 themselves.

Generous donations from readers who saw her plight in the Daily Mail mean they now have more than £50,000 for the operation and intensive physiotherapy afterwards.

But wellwishers decided to hold the fundraising day to raise extra money so Sophie can have all the therapy and specialist equipment she needs to give her the best chance of walking.

Organisers believe an opportunist thief swiped the money from cash boxes at the event in Stockport, Greater Manchester, on April 6.

They had expected to raise £800 on the day, which was to be split between Sophie's surgery fund and the Alzheimer's Society, but were left with just the £300 which stallholders had paid to attend.

Sophie's mother Allison, 40, said she was 'devastated' about the theft.

'It is just awful,' she said. 'It is quite a lot of money which would have gone to both charities.'

Event organiser Mel Parkin, 32, said: 'It looks like someone grabbed the cash out of a couple of the cashboxes.

'With all the work that went into the event and the amount of people there, it is really disappointing.'

She said they had no hope of tracking down who took the money because there was no CCTV at the venue. She is now selling raffle tickets in a bid to recover the money lost.

Sophie's family hope she will have a date for the life-changing surgery before she turns three in January, meaning she could be walking unaided by the age of five.

Mrs Thomlinson, from Dukinfield, Greater Manchester, said they had been 'overwhelmed' by the generosity shown by the public.

'Without the money raised by Mail readers we could have been looking at not even getting the operation until she was seven,' she said. 'I wish I could thank everyone who donated individually.

'It is not just Sophie's life, the readers have made such a difference to our lives as a family.'
