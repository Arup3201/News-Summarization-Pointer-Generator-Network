Paris City Council authorized Mayor Anne Hidalgo on Wednesday to sue U.S. broadcaster Fox News for reporting there are 'no-go zones' in the French capital where non-Muslims and police fear to venture.

City officials voted to file a lawsuit at a French court for defamation regarding comments on Fox News and a map it broadcast with eight such so-called off-limits areas circled in red. 

The report came when Paris was on high alert after attacks by Islamic radicals last month.

Suing: Paris mayor Anne Hidalgo (above) announced in an interview with CNN last month that the city would be suing FOX News and today the Paris City Council authorized the lawsuit

Fox was widely mocked for that report and for comments describing the English city of Birmingham as 'totally Muslim.' 

The broadcaster later apologized for 'some regrettable errors.'

Hidalgo vowed to 'save Paris' honor,' and stressed the importance of image for a top world tourist destination.

A law firm representing Fox News said the broadcaster would fight any lawsuit brought in Paris. 

'The decision by the City of Paris to bring legal proceedings against a United States news organization is antithetical to free speech,' according to a statement provided by Fox News from lawyer Dori Ann Hanswirth of the Hogan Lovells law firm. 

'Fox News will invoke every protection afforded it under all applicable laws.'

The city of Paris first said they intended to sue Rupert Murdoch's Fox News after the U.S. cable network 'insulted' the French capital's image, Paris mayor Anne Hidalgo said last month.

During an interview with CNN's Christiane Amanpour, Hidalgo said the city was planning legal action against Fox News because the honor of Paris had been 'prejudiced.' 

In the wake of the deadly attacks at the satirical newspaper Charlie Hebdo and at a kosher supermarket in Paris, Fox News apologized last month for falsely portraying some neighborhoods in the city.

Controversial: Steven Emerson (right), billed as an expert on terrorism-related issues, described Birmingham as a no-go area for non-Muslims last month 

Host Sean Hannity was the first to make mention of the alleged zones on his January 7 program, saying; 'It seems if you watch in recent years, it’s not just France but all of Europe, there’s been a major influx, immigration, people from Muslim countries. They’ve even - and they’ve not assimilated, they’ve separated.'

He then added; 'They have no-go zones. If you’re non-Muslim, you’re not allowed. Not police, not even fire department if there’s a fire. Sharia courts have been allowed to be established. Prayer rugs in just about every hotel.'

Just a few days later, Jeanine Pirro welcomed analyst Steve Emerson on her show, who said of these zones, believed by many to be entirely inaccurate from the start; 'They’re sort of amorphous, they’re not contiguous necessarily, but they’re sort of safe havens.'

Response: Fox News presenter Julie Banderas told viewers: 'Over the course of this last week we have made some regrettable errors on air'. She added the apology applies to 'discussions of so-called no-go zones'

Emerson then took the idea a step further by stating; 'And they’re places where the governments, like France, Britain, Sweden, Germany — they don’t exercise any sovereignty so you basically have zones where Sharia courts are set up, where Muslim density is very intense, where police don’t go in.'

Finally, Emerson wrapped the segment up by making the claim that Birmingham, England was an example of one of these zones, and that 'non-Muslims just simply don’t go in.' 

FOX News ultimately issued corrections for these statements, as well as an apology. 

That, however, was not enough for Mayor Hidalgo.

'When we're insulted, and when we've had an image, then I think we'll have to sue, I think we'll have to go to court, in order to have these words removed,' she told CNN's Amanpour last month.

'The image of Paris has been prejudiced, and the honor of Paris has been prejudiced.'

Michael Clemente, the Executive Vice President of News at the network said in a statement last month; 'We empathize with the citizens of France as they go through a healing process and return to everyday life. However, we find the Mayor’s comments regarding a lawsuit misplaced.'
