Property sales grew at their fastest annual rate in a decade in the six months to September 2013, according to a report.

It showed that the housing market revival has spread across England and Wales – and is not just limited to London.

Every town in the North, the West Midlands, Wales and the capital recorded a year-on-year increase in home sales, research by Lloyds Bank found.

Boom: A new report shows the speed of property sales has increased faster than at any point in the last decade

Across England and Wales as a whole, 98 per cent of towns were found to have enjoyed an annual uplift in sales. A year earlier, just over a quarter of towns saw a year-on-year increase.

The report, which used Land Registry figures, found there were 396,756 house sales in the six months to September, marking an increase of 21 per cent on the same period in 2012 – and the highest year-on-year increase in a decade.

But property sales were still 41 per cent below a market peak of 673,699 sales in the half-year to September 2006 at the height of the boom.

In further evidence that the market pick-up is spreading beyond London, Lloyds found that the North West and the East Midlands saw a 23 per cent rise in activity between March to September 2012 and the same period a year later.

Revival: The increase is backed by a steady increase in house prices

On a more local level, the East London borough of Newham saw the largest year-on-year increase in home sales, with a 62 per cent rise in the six months to September compared with the same period a year earlier.

Crowborough in East Sussex saw the biggest drop in home sales over the same period, with a 10 per cent fall in transactions.

Marc Page, mortgages director at Lloyds Bank, said: 'Low interest rates, improvements in consumer confidence and Government schemes, such as Help to Buy, all appear to have contributed to the rise in home sales.'
