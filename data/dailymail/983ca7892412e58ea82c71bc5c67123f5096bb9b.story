The boss: Angela Ahrendts, CEO of Burberry, has topped the bluechip executive pay league taking home almost £5million more than her next big-earning counterparts

As a child, her home was so cramped she created a ‘bedroom’ for herself under the stairs.

These days there are no such space issues for Angela Ahrendts, boss of British fashion house Burberry – after she became the first woman to top the City pay league.

Indeed, the total package of £16.9million that the 53-year-old enjoyed last year would probably allow her to buy the tiny town in the US where she grew up.

The mother-of-three, a committed Christian who reads the Bible every day, beat her closest rivals in the FTSE 100 index – all men – by nearly £5million.

While her basic salary is around £1million, the largest chunk of her extraordinary windfall came from selling £11.9million of shares in the fashion giant built up over several years.

The company, whose models currently include Cara Delevingne and David and Victoria Beckham’s son Romeo, insist Mrs Ahrendts is worth every penny, delivering ‘record revenue and profit’.

Despite the global economic meltdown – which began shortly after she became boss in July 2006 – the share price has trebled under her stewardship.

It is an extraordinary result for a woman who spent her childhood in the remote outpost of New Palestine, Indiana (population, around 2,000). One of six children, she often sewed her own clothes.

The home was cramped, with the family of eight squeezed into four bedrooms.

Her older sister, Carrie, once explained: ‘There wasn’t much privacy. So, when she was ten, Angela took over the little space below the stairwell, the place you put coats. She installed black lights and put in shelves, where she lit candles she’d hand-dipped. It was famous in the neighbourhood. Everyone came to see Angela’s place.’

Today she no longer has to resort to such Harry Potter-style conditions. Taking on her job at Burberry, she had to relocate her husband Gregg, 53, and their children – Jennings, 17, and daughters Sommer, 16, and Angelina, 12 –  from New York to London.

Gregg, her childhood sweetheart from primary school, was forced to give up a successful construction business, though his expertise has proven useful in the extensive renovation of the couple’s large neo-Georgian manor house in the countryside, 20 minutes west of London.

The couple have two Bernese Mountain dogs, Sonny and Rocker, who love to bound down the wide white marble steps of their 12,000 sq ft estate with an indoor pool and a tennis court.

Items such as one of Burberry’s handbags are small change to Mrs Ahrendts. While The Orchard handbag in ‘python bridle leather’ is beyond the means of most women, she can more than cope with its £3,495 price tag.

Just in case she doesn’t want to pay full price however, she can always use her 80 per cent discount or £25,000 Burberry clothing allowance. Mrs Ahrendts, a self-confessed Diet Coke addict, usurped Bob Diamond, the former chief executive of Barclays, once dubbed ‘the unacceptable face of banking’ in the pay league.

Mr Diamond, who left the bank following the interest-rate fixing scandal last year, had won the top prize in the 2011 survey with a gold-plated package of £20.9million.

The executive pay survey, which is conducted annually by the remuneration experts MM&K and Manifest, saw the average FTSE 100 chief executive enjoy a 10 per cent total pay rise to £4.25million.

Mrs Ahrendts spent 20 years working her way up to the top in the fashion industry after gaining a merchandising and marketing degree from Ball State University.

She did her time at less glamorous places like bra maker Warnaco and working-girl staple Liz Claiborne, where she spent eight years before moving to Britain.

At one point she was working 80 hours a week. She is credited with ‘de-chavving’ Burberry, after its famous check had become popular with minor celebrities and football fans and was being widely counterfeited. It has subsequently been removed from the vast majority of the firm’s products.

A Burberry spokesman said: ‘Under Angela’s leadership Burberry delivered record revenue and profit during 2011/12, building on a track record of performance which delivered £4billion of value to shareholders through share price growth and dividends in the five years to 2012.’

Mrs Ahrendts also donated 10 per cent of her salary to the Burberry Foundation, a charity, last year, as she has done in previous years.
