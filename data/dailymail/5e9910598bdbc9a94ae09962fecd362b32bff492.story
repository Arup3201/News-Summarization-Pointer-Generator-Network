The driver of a bin lorry which killed six Christmas shoppers after he had a cardiac arrest  at the wheel said today he thinks about each victim 'every minute of every day'.

Harry Clarke was unconscious when his refuse vehicle mounted a packed pavement in the centre of Glasgow on December 22, killing six people and injuring up to a dozen more.

Speaking for the first time today Mr Clarke, who was in hospital for two weeks afterwards, said he never knew he had heart problems until he woke up afterwards.

The 58-year-old also cannot 'remember anything at all' about the crash.

Tragedy: Harry Clarke, the driver of the bin lorry that killed six people after he fell unconscious at the wheel has spoken for the first time about his grief for the victims on December 22 in Glasgow

'I was never aware of anything being wrong with my heart until that day,' he told the Daily Record.

'I understand a lot of people want to know what happened that day. I wish I could tell you but I can't. I just want all of the families of the injured and deceased to know I can't remember anything,

'Nothing will ever be normal for the families or me ever again. I think of everyone every minute of every day. I grieve for everyone involved in the accident. Every day is a struggle.'

He said that he has not spoken out because of his fragile health but did not want to be silent in case it offended the families of those killed.

He said:  'I've felt awful not speaking out.  I am not saying that to get sympathy. I don't want that but I don't want the families to think I have been hiding'.

Eyewitnesses said Mr Clarke appeared to fall ill at the wheel of the vehicle before losing control and hitting Christmas shoppers on Queen Street. 

The truck eventually came to a halt when it crashed into the Millennium Hotel but it had already left many dead.

John 'Jack' Sweeney, 68, his wife Lorraine, 69, and their 18-year-old granddaughter Erin McQuade were all shopping when struck and killed by the truck.

Primary school teacher Stephenie Tait, 29, tax worker Jacqueline Morton, 51, both from Glasgow and Gillian Ewing, 52, from Edinburgh were also killed in the crash. 

Thousands of people have attended their funerals over the past month. 

Investigators for Police Scotland are expected to submit their final report on the tragedy to the Crown Office in the coming weeks.

A probe of eyewitness accounts and technical data has been pieced together. The families of those killed in the crash have been constantly updated on how the investigation has been progressing.
