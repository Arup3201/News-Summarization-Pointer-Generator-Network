Ireland batsman Ed Joyce benefited from a huge stroke of luck in Wednesday's World Cup match against the United Arab Emirates.

UAE fast bowler Amjad Javed delivered a terrific ball that raced through the defences of Joyce and clipped the off stump.

However the left-hander was handed a staggering reprieve when the bails shuffled from their groove and landed back in place.

LAW 30 (BOWLED)

1. Out Bowled

(a) The striker is out Bowled if his wicket is put down by a ball delivered by the bowler, not being a No ball, even if it first touches his bat or person.

LAW 28 (THE WICKET IS DOWN)

1. Wicket put down

(a) The wicket is put down if a bail is completely removed from the top of the stumps, or a stump is struck out of the ground,

(i) by the ball,

or (ii) by the striker’s bat if he is holding it or by any part of his bat that he is holding

The electronic red bail light signalling contact had lit up when the white ball struck the outside of the black stump, but Joyce could not be given out and the former England batsman was handed a second life.

That was a major relief for Ireland, who at the time were 35 for one in pursuit of a 277 victory target. To add insult to injury, Joyce drove the next ball from Javed down the ground for a boundary.

Earlier, UAE batsman Shaiman Anwar cracked 106 from 83 balls to lead a recovery from 131 for six, resulting in a team total of 276 for nine.

Joyce had another stroke of luck when spinner Mohammad Tauqir failed to grip on to a caught-and-bowled chance.

But his run of fortune ran out in the 19th over when Amjad finally had his man.

Having reached 37, Joyce drove outside off stump but snicked the ball to wicketkeeper Swapnil Patil.

It looked like a significant blow to Ireland, who fell to 72 for two, having earlier lost Paul Sterling for just three runs in the second over.
