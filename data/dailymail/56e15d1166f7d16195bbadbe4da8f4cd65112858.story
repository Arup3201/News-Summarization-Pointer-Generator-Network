When Matthew Briggs, 32, from Huntington in North Yorkshire noticed that his father had posted a photo of them together on Facebook, he was initially pleased.

But when he opened the photo and saw the image, Mr Briggs was left horrified by the sight of his 31st frame.

Now, two years on, he has shed an astonishing 17st and, in November, will complete the New York marathon in memory of his mother Susan who died from multiple sclerosis when he was just 18.

Pounding the pavements: Matthew Briggs, 32, has lost an impressive 17st in just two years of slimming

'In March of 2000, she lost her battle with Multiple Sclerosis,' he says. 'She has always been my inspiration. I am the man I am today because of theÂ woman she was.'

Money raised by Mr Briggs' 26-mile run will be donated to the Multiple Sclerosis Society, a charity dedicated to beating the disease as well as supporting sufferers and their families.

Mr Briggs, who has dropped from 31st to just under 14st, had piled on the pounds thanks to a diet of ready meals, takeaways and daily two litre bottles of Coca-Cola.

But, after seeing the photo posted on Facebook and spurred on by a bet with his father, Mr Briggs joined his local Slimming World group and went on to shed more than 17st over two years.

Along with swapping fatty takeaways for three healthy meals a day, Mr Briggs took up running in a bid to beat the bulge - picking up a new hobby in the process.

Having already taken part in the London marathon and a local race, Mr Briggs will now compete in New York and says he is paying for his ticket and accommodation himself to ensure that every penny raised goes straight to the Multiple Sclerosis Society.

''I inherited many of my qualities from her,' he says of his mother. 'She used all her strength and determination until the end to try and fight this disease. The strength and determination is what I used as part of my weight loss journey.

'If you had told me that first night that I would be running marathons in the future I would have laughed myself silly, but here I am - about to compete in my third.'
