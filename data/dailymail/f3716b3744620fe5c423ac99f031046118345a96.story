The son of the Canadian Consul General in Miami is behind bars after a gunfight erupted on Monday, and her other son is dead.

Marc Wabafiyebazu, 15, has been arrested for felony murder and his brother Jean, 17, was shot dead after an incident in which the two reportedly tried to rob a group of Miami drug dealers.

Their mother is Roxanne Dubé, who was only recently appointed to the role of consul general in Miami.

According to the Miami Herald, police believe the two young men were armed with guns as they tried to rob a group of men during a drug deal at a home in the Coral Way area.

The boys had reportedly agreed to purchase two pounds of marijuana at a cost of $5,000, and driven to the house under the guise of making said purchase in their mother's BMW with diplomatic plates.

Police claim that their plan was to then rob the drug dealers.

Gunfire broke out soon after they entered, and Jean and Joshua Wright were killed, while Anthony Rodriguez was wounded.

Marc was in the car when this incident occurred.  

Both Marc and Rodriguez were arrested under a Florida law that says anyone who participates in a violent felony that results in death can be charged with murder.

Rodriguez has also been charged with possession of marijuana with intent to sell.

A second man was reportedly with Jean when he went to rob the drug dealers, though his identity is not known at this time.

Dubé was appointed to her new position in November, but only arrived in Miami in February.

The boys’ father, Germano Wabafiyebazu, told Global News that he does not think Marc had anything to do with this tragedy, and that he was just in the wrong place at the wrong time.

He also said the boys kept to themselves, and did not have much of a social life.

'My wife told me they didn’t go out,' he said. 

'They went to school, went home, went to school.'

Police are still trying to figure out how and where the young men got their weapons.
