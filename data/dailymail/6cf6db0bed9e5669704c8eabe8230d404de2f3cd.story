A businessman has won a legal case against easyJet after challenging the airline's sky-high cancellation fees for a flight.

Father-of-three Adam Rubens, of Bushey, Hertfordshire, had booked a ticket to Tel Aviv, Israel, last December, but changed his plans half an hour later.

The budget carrier charged the 47-year-old a total of £135 to cancel the £306 he paid for the flight and extra fees.

'Unreasonable': Budget airline easyJet charged businessman Adam Rubens a total of £135 to cancel a £306 flight he booked in December, which Mr Rubens claimed was a 'rip-off

On top of a £60 flight cancellation fee and £17 credit card charge easyJet also 'retained' the £38 baggage fee and £20 seat allocation fee.

Mr Rubens said he was happy to pay the cancellation fee and credit card charge, but claimed the additional charges were only legally enforceable if they were seen to be 'reasonable'.

Deputy District Judge Kenneth Arnold rejected easyJet's claim at Watford County Court it was entitled to the full fees because Mr Rubens agreed to the terms and conditions.

Instead, Judge Arnold ruled easyJet's terms and conditions were 'unreasonable'.

He awarded Mr Rubens his £58 baggage and seat fees plus £50 legal costs.

EasyJet told The Sun on Sunday the policy was 'clearly stated in our terms and conditions which passengers agree to'

'That's the equivalent of 44 per cent as a cancellation charge,' he told the Jewish Chronicle. 'In my opinion, that was wholly unreasonable and I challenged them to justify it.

'Their response was that they were entitled to make those deductions under their terms and conditions.' 

He added: 'This was never about the money. It was all about the principle that one should not accept what is blatantly unfair.

'This has implications for millions of passengers travelling using budget airlines. Too many people accept their fate because it is written in a company's terms and conditions.

'The court held that those terms still have to pass the test of reasonableness.'

An EasyJet spokeswoman said: 'easyJet is a non-refundable airline and our cancellation policy is clearly stated in our terms and conditions, which passengers agree to and acknowledge as part of the booking process.

'easyJet permits refunds within 24 hours of the booking subject to a cancellation fee of £30 per passenger, per flight which allows customers to retrieve money from an unwanted flight while covering our administration costs.'
