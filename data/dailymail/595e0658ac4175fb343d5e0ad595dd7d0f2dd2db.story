Notorious villains: Now the story of Ronnie and Reggie Kray is being turned into a film by Oscar-winning writer, Brian Helgeland

They were gangland villains of the highest order, violent thugs who terrified London's East End as they committed a string of robberies, arsons, assaults and murders.

Now the story of Ronnie and Reggie Kray is to be told in a new biopic written and directed by Oscar-winning LA Confidential writer, Brian Helgeland.

And the twin brothers are to be played by one actor, London-born Tom Hardy, 36, who will indicate his change between brothers by donning glasses when he's playing Ronnie.

Filming for the movie, which is still in development, began in Essex this week, and production is expected to start later this year. 

With the working title of Legend, the biopic is expected to focus on the Krays' organised reign of crime and terror in the London underworld of the 1950s and 1960s.

And Mr Helgeland will have plenty of material.

The brothers, who were born in Hoxton, east London, in 1933, began their life of violence young.  At nine, they had such a violent fight that Ronnie, the younger by ten minutes, almost died from his head injury.

A decade later, and already known for their violence and thuggishness, they walked out of national service, pausing only to punch the corporal who tried to stop them, leaving him seriously injured.

They were arrested and sent back to the Army, but went AWOL again, only to assault a policeman who tried to arrest them, which landed them in the Tower of London, as some of the last prisoners ever to be detained there, followed by a string of other prisons and then a dishonourable discharge from the Army.

Crime took the thuggish brothers away from what could have been a promising future in boxing, and they devoted their lives to their gang, known as The Firm, while attempting a series of business ventures.

The first of these was a club called The Regal off Mile End Road, which had an uninviting exterior but inside was a glamorous and decadent nightclub, overseen by the sharp-suited brothers.

Despite their smooth appearances, however, the brothers were involved in a life of appalling crime, running protection rackets, as well as staging hijacks and armed robberies.

Ronnie, who was considered the more violent of the two, was imprisoned for GBH in 1957, and diagnosed with paranoid schizophrenia during his jail term.  He was also publicly bisexual, an unusual thing to admit at the time, and something his brother found hard to come to terms with.

Reggie was imprisoned two years later, but by 1960 both were out of prison and had become almost celebrities, socialising with stars such as Barbara Windsor, Frank Sinatra and Judy Garland, as well as well as eminent politicians including Lord Boothby, with whom Ronnie had an affair.

In 1965, Reggie married Frances Shea, but the union only lasted a few months and she died in 1967, apparently from suicide but it was rumoured that Ronnie murdered her.

The police frequently investigated the twins' activities, but with the East End living in fear of the notorious twins, no-one dared testify against them, so their misdemeanours often went unchallenged.

The Firm then largely consisted of the brothers, their cousin, Albert Donoghue, and at least 13 others, including brothers Tony and Chris Lambrianou.

In 1966, the Krays helped Frank Mitchell, also known as The Mad Axeman, escape from Dartmoor Prison, and put him up at a friend's flat in East Ham.  He subsequently disappeared, and while the brothers were acquitted of his murder, a later book claimed that he had been shot.

Quite a story: Filming for the biopic, written and directed by Brian Helgeland, started in Essex this week

Their story was told in the 1990 British film, The Krays, in which Gary and Martin Kemp played the brothers

The same year, Ronnie shot George Cornell dead in the Blind Beggar pub in Whitechapel.  Cornell, an associate of South London gang, the Richardsons, is said to have remarked: 'Well look who's here' just before he was shot.

And In 1967, Reggie Kray murdered former gang member Jack 'The Hat' Mcvitie in Stoke Newington, stabbing him in the face and stomach with a carving knife, twisting the knife as McVitie lay dying.

The brothers were finally brought to justice in the middle of 1968, when they and several members of The Firm were arrested, and both brothers given life sentences with no chance of parole for 30 years.

The judge, Mr Justice Melford Stevenson, told them: 'In my view, society has earned a rest from your activities.'

They were allowed out of prison for their mother's funeral in 1982, but Ronnie died in Broadmoor, aged 61 in 1995, and Reggie, died at 66, in 2000, a few weeks after being allowed out on compassionate leave.

Film industry executives have shown great interest in the film about the Krays, with buyers hailing the script as 'one of the best' they'd come across.

The Krays' story was previously told in the 1990 British film, The Krays, with real life brothers Martin and Gary Kemp playing the title roles.
