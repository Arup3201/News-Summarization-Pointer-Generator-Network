Prosecutor Azrah Yousaff said: 'This came to light after a paper girl delivered her papers between 2013 and 2014.

'She went past the accused's house on a few occasions and she seen him standing completely naked at his living room window.

'This happened three or four times.

'She told her gran about the situation.

'On the 15 April 2014, at about 10 to seven in the morning, the paper girl was delivering her papers and when she was delivering them she looked at the accused's house and seen him fully clothed at his living room window.

'She made a few more deliveries and returned to the accused's house minutes later and as she past she seen him completely naked standing in the middle of the living room window.

'She said she felt uncomfortable and disturbed by this.'

Mrs Yousaff said the paper girl told her grandmother, who then called the police.

She added that the next day, on the 16th April, the paper girl witnessed Beveridge standing naked again and mentioned it to a neighbour of the accused.

Beveridge, of Fairways, Dunfermline pled guilty to committing an offence of public indecency on a number of occasions between January 1 2013 and April 16 2014 at his home address. 

His defence lawyer, Jonathan Matheson-Dear told the court that it was 'common practice' for Beveridge to sleep naked and then wander around his house with no clothes on.

He said: 'It was thoughtlessness on his part.

'He didn't give it any thought that anybody passing outside couldn't see in.

'It is clear that it was not presented at any particular individual.

'Because it was in his home he thought it was perfectly acceptable behaviour.

'He is extremely embarrassed and ashamed and is aware that he will be place on the register.

'He is a married man with children.'

Sheriff Charlie Macnair placed Beveridge on the sex offenders register and deferred sentencing for reports to be produced.

He said: 'Sentence is deferred for a criminal justice social work report to be produced.'
