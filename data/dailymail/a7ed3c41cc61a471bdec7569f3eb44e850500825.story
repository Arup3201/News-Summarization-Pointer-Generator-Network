More than 2,000 Amazon staff at German warehouses went on strike on Monday to press demands for better pay and conditions as the online retailer races to ensure Christmas orders are delivered on time.

Labour union Verdi said almost 2,300 workers joined the action at five of Amazon's nine distribution centres in Germany, and that the action would be extended to a sixth on Tuesday - the most warehouses hit by a strike in the long-running dispute.

The walkouts at the centres are set to run until the end of Wednesday's late shift and Verdi said delays to deliveries could not be ruled out as a result of the strikes.

Amazon itself said customers could order up until midnight on December 21 to get gifts in time for Christmas, or even on December 23 or 24 if they pay for express delivery.

'We deliver reliably,' a spokeswoman said, adding that only a small minority of workers had joined the strikes, with around 19,000 employees working normally.

Last year, Amazon orders in Germany peaked on December 15, when customers bought 4.6 million items - or 53 per second.

Verdi has organised frequent strikes at Amazon since May 2013 as it seeks to force the retailer to raise pay for workers at its distribution centres in accordance with collective bargaining agreements across Germany's mail order and retail industry.

Confident: The U.S. company has previously said the long-running dispute has not affected deliveries as the vast majority of workers in Germany have not joined the strikes and it can draw on a European network of 28 warehouses in seven countries

Amazon has repeatedly rejected the union's demands, saying it regards warehouse staff as logistics workers and that they receive above-average pay by the standards of that industry.

The U.S. company has previously said the long-running dispute has not affected deliveries as the vast majority of workers in Germany have not joined the strikes and it can draw on a European network of 28 warehouses in seven countries.

It employs almost 10,000 staff at its warehouses in Germany, its second-biggest market behind the United States, as well as more than 10,000 seasonal workers.

It comes after tens of thousands of families in Britain said they have been left in a panic that gifts bought online will not arrive in time for Christmas.

Couriers delivering goods for major retailers including Amazon, Marks and Spencer, John Lewis and Waterstones were said to be in chaos as they struggled to deal with huge backlogs.

They blamed an unprecedented surge in online shopping over the past fortnight. 

Yodel, the UK’s largest delivery company after Royal Mail, was unable to collect parcels from retailers this weekend as it is already three days behind on existing orders.

It spent the weekend desperately trying to clear the thousands of gifts already piled up in warehouses, with some couriers even delivering parcels in the middle of the night.

The company – employed by a string of retailers including Amazon, Boots, Argos, Waterstones and Tesco Direct – said it will not resume normal collections until today at the earliest.
