A Texas mother-of-two who was allegedly shot dead by her boyfriend's jilted ex in a tragic murder suicide Saturday has been pictured for the first time.

Amy Picchiotti, 38, was found dead with Jonathon Masin, 40, at his Murphy home. The two bodies were partially clothed and barefoot in separate rooms, according to police.

Masin's ex girlfriend, Michelle Boyer, 45, was found in her SUV hours later, near the home of her ex-husband, Charles Hobbs.

Police recovered a suicide note with Boyer's body, as well as a handgun allegedly similar to the one used to kill Masin and Picchiotti.

Boyer and Masin both had worked at Texas Instruments and Picchiotti was a close friend of Boyer's, it has emerged.

Brian Hasenbauer, who knew both women well, said that Boyer told him she was in a committed relationship with Masin when she learned Picchiotti was also romantically involved with him.

'We discussed the situation, and we tried to provide her comfort in dealing with the pain she was experiencing,' Hasenbauer wrote in an email to Dallasnews.com.

'We never imagined that this would ever happen, and we are praying for those that lost their lives.'

Boyer and Picchiotti became friends while training for and running triathlons together in Dallas.

A fellow training partner, Gayle Mortola, said she was stunned at Boyer's alleged actions.

'There's nothing I know about ... [Boyer] that would lead me to believe she'd do anything like that at all,' she said.

Picchiotti filed for divorce from her husband of almost seven years, Larry Picchiotti, in March. The couple had two young daughters and friends have set up a fundraising website in their honor.

'Though her life was punctuated with tremendous athletic accomplishments, her crowning achievements were her children,' the Youcaring.com site says of Picchiotti. 'These beautiful girls, proud of their artistic displays of affection, are now left with no mother to receive their show of love.'

It didn't take long for police to label the shocking slaying a murder-suicide at the hands of a bitter ex-girlfriend.

Boyer was discovered dead in her car from a self-inflicted gun shot wound. She left behind a note that police say detailed the ghastly scene.

A town in shock: Police in the quiet Dallas suburb of Murphy say their first murder in recent memory involved the slaying of Jonathan Masin, 40, and 38-year-old Amy Picchiotti at the hands of Masin's scorned ex-girlfriend

Boyer chose to kill herself while parked in front of the home of her ex-husband, whom she divorced in 2011.

Neighbors of Masin's heard what they believed were gunshots around 6:30am Saturday.

Later that morning, the father of one of the victims made a call to police for a welfare check at Masin's home, leading to the discovery of the bodies.

'Found in two separate parts of the home, they were partially clothed and barefooted,' said police in Murphy, where city manager James Fisher would later note that he couldn't remember a murder of any kind in the quiet town, much less such a sensational slaying.

A few miles away in Dallas, Boyer's body was found in a parked car. She was dead from a self-inflicted gunshot wound from the same caliber weapon as the one that killed Masin and Picchiotti.

She left a note behind that contained details of the murder scene.

Police stopped short of naming a motive outright, 'however, it has been confirmed that Boyer is the ex-girlfriend of Masin and it is the breakup that led to this murder-suicide,' read a police news release.
