At the age of 77 and no longer in tip-top health, our greatest ever jockey Lester Piggott nevertheless still has an eye for an attractive filly.

For I can reveal that the nine-times Derby winner is no longer to be found living in Newmarket with his long-suffering wife Susan, to whom he has been married for 52 eventful years.

Instead, he has moved abroad to start a new life with a woman more than 20 years his junior.

Hot to trot: Former champion jockey Lester Piggot has left his wife of 52 years for the attractive Lady Barbara FitzGerald, right, a woman 20 years his junior

She is attractive Lady Barbara FitzGerald, 55, whose estranged husband Lord John is heir presumptive to his brother, the Duke of Leinster.

Piggott and Lady Barbara are, I am told, ensconced in a rented house on the outskirts of Geneva, a location some will see as ironic after Lester’s conviction for tax fraud 25 years ago.

After a year in jail, he was stripped of his OBE, a move widely seen as unnecessarily cruel.

According to friends, Lester and Swiss-born mother-of-two Barbara are planning to build a house together in Switzerland.

They have known each other for many 
years because Barbara’s marital home is in Newmarket, a town where all 
the racing folk know each other intimately.

Her
husband is the racing manager of Lanwades Stud at  nearby Moulton. 
Barbara previously worked in the town for racehorse auctioneers 
Tattersalls.

Long-suffering: Piggott and his wife of 52 years Susan. They have two daughters Maureen, a former eventer who is married to Derby-winning trainer William Haggas, and Irish TV sports presenter, Tracy

Piggott, who won 5,000 races over 48 years, including the Oaks six times and the St Leger eight times, has two daughters by Susan — Maureen, a former eventer who is married to Derby-winning  trainer William Haggas, and Irish TV sports presenter, Tracy.

He also has a son, Jamie, from a previous long-standing mistress and former assistant, Anna Ludlow. But their 16-year affair fizzled out some time ago.

Lester has suffered cardiac problems 
in the past and in 2007 was taken to hospital in Lausanne after 
suffering a heart attack on holiday on Lake Geneva.

But
he bounced back and just three months later I reported he was playing 
golf in Newmarket with attractive blonde widow, Diana Vigors, 13 years 
his junior. At the time, Diana insisted to me their friendship was  
platonic.

Susan, who remains at the family home, is philosophical about the change in her domestic life. She tells me: ‘I have known Barbara for years and she is a very nice person. We are all still friends and that goes for all the family.

‘Put it this way, at 72 you feel very differently about things than you do at 25. All I wish for is Lester’s health and happiness. There are no hard feelings.’

‘It’s all good. I have met Lester and I like him,’ says Barbara’s daughter, Hermione, 26, a professional golfer. ‘My mother is happy with him and as far as my parents are concerned, I hope it will be a fresh start for both of them.’
