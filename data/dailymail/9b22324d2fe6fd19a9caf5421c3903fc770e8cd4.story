The Duke of Cambridge is to visit China for the very first time early next year, Kensington Palace has confirmed.

William will travel to the country at the end of February and return to the UK in early March, but will be without the Duchess of Cambridge, who will be almost eight months pregnant.

The Duke will spend three days in Japan and carry out a series of engagements in Tokyo before travelling to China for a three-day visit - much of which will be spent in Beijing.

Staying at home: The Duchess of Cambridge, who will be almost eight months pregnant, is not going

William will become the first senior royal to visit China, since the Queen and Prince Philip who spent time there in 1986. 

That visit wasn't entirely without hiccups, with Prince Philip overheard describing Beijing as 'ghastly' and later making his infamous 'slitty eye' quip to a British student living there. 

Prince Charles, who is a supporter of the Dalai Lama, has never been to mainland China but did travel to Hong Kong for the handover ceremony in 1997.

William’s trip will put the spotlight on his father’s uneasy relationship with China and also raise questions about why Charles has yet to make an official visit to the republic.

A high profile tour by the Duke of Cambridge will be viewed as an attempt to improve diplomatic relations with the country and comes after the red carpet was rolled out for Chinese prime minister Li Keqiang when he visited London in June.

Despite not being head of state, the Chinese politician reportedly demanded a private audience with the Queen and even threatened to cancel the trip if it didn't happen.

Unlike the Queen, who did eventually meet with Mr Li, Charles’s dealings with China have been troubled in the past, particularly after he described China’s leaders as 'appalling old waxworks' in a leaked diary.

In 1999, he was accused of boycotting a Chinese state visit to the UK by failing to attend a banquet held for the then-president Jiang Zemin.

During a visit from Mr Jiang's successor, Hu Jintao in 2005, Charles carefully side-stepped the issue by being out of the country on a tour of the US on the night of the official dinner. He did not meet Mr Hu on the remaining two days of his visit.

Four years later, Charles did meet Mr Hu but during a meeting held at the Mandarin Oriental in Knightsbridge rather than at his London home, Clarence House.

During the meeting, he raised the subject of Tibet, whose exiled leader, the Dalai-Lama, Charles is known to admire.

2009 also saw Charles sanction the opening of The Prince’s Charities Foundation (China) in Beijing - a move seen as a step towards a friendlier relationship with the country.

The Prince’s Foundation for the Built Environment also worked with Chinese planning authorities and a university on a restoration project.

Although the Queen remains diplomatic in her dealings with Chinese visitors, the Duke of Edinburgh, much like his son, has been freer with his opinions.

Ghastly! Prince Philip's verdict on Beijing, overheard during a 1986 state visit to China with the Queen

During a 1986 tour of China, Philip was overheard describing Beijing as 'ghastly' and told British exchange students: 'If you stay here much longer you’ll all be slitty-eyed.'

The same year, he told a World Wildlife Fund meeting: 'If it has four legs and it’s not a chair, if it’s got two wings and it flies but is not an aeroplane and if it swims and it’s not a submarine, the Cantonese will eat it.'

Most recently, in 2010, on hearing that President Obama had had dinner with the presidents of Russia and China, he quipped: 'How can you tell the difference between them?'
