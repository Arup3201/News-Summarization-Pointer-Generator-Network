U.S. Representative Jaime Herrera Beutler's two-week-old baby is believed by doctors to be the first child to survive Potter Sequence, a usually fatal in-utero illness caused by prenatal kidney failure.

Abigail Rose Beutler was born prematurely at 28 weeks on July 15, Herrera Beutler announced Monday. Doctors had diagnosed Potter Sequence, in which impaired kidney function leads to low amniotic fluid during pregnancy. It is typically fatal because the lack of amniotic fluid prevents the lungs from developing.

In an uncommon procedure, doctors at Johns Hopkins Hospital in Baltimore performed amnioinfusion by injecting saline solution into Beutler's womb in the place of amniotic fluid, during the pregnancy.

Though only two pounds 12 ounces at birth, Abigail had fully developed lungs and she is breathing on her own, suggesting that the relatively uncommon treatment had worked. Abigail has no kidneys and still requires ongoing dialysis and will eventually need a kidney transplant.

Herrera Beutler and her husband said in a statement that they were thankful for the doctors and nurses who were not willing to accept the fatal diagnosis.

'We are grateful to the thousands who joined us in praying for a miracle. But most of all, we are grateful to God for hearing those prayers,' Herrera Beutler and her husband said in a joint statement.

On a Facebook page announcing the baby's birth, the Beutlers reveal how they refused to give up on their baby.

'Multiple doctors explained that based on medical evidence her condition was incompatible with life and that, if she survived to term, she would be unable to breathe and live only moments after birth,' they write.

'We were also told that dialysis or transplant were not possible.  The options we were offered were termination or “expectant management,” that is, waiting for her to die. Instead, we chose to pray earnestly for a miracle.'

Dr Louis Halamek, a neonatologist at Lucile Packard Children's Hospital in California, said he is cautiously optimistic about the baby's future.

'Despite Abigail's prematurity, small size and life-threatening disease, she is doing well,' Halamek said.

Herrera Beutler, 34, is a Republican in her second term in Congress, representing the 3rd district covering the southwest portion of Washington state. She and her husband, Daniel, had announced the tragic 
development regarding their first child on Beutler's Facebook page. 

'At
a recent, routine ultrasound appointment we received the difficult news
that our baby has a serious medical condition called Potter’s 
Syndrome,' the Beutlers wrote.

'Potter’s Syndrome (or Potter’s Sequence)
is abnormally low amniotic fluid caused by impaired kidney function 
which inhibits normal lung development and is often fatal.'

Expectant mother: Rep. Beutler, 34, had announced on May 1 that she was expecting her first child in the fall

Babies with Potter Sequence typically die within a couple days of being born, according to the National Institute of Health.

The
condition's primary problem is when the kidneys, which normally produce
amniotic fluid, fail to develop properly as the baby is growing in the 
womb.

Without amniotic
fluid, the infant is not cushioned from the walls of the uterus, which 
can lead to abnormal facial and limb development. The condition may also stunt the development of the lungs.

The
couple wrote that they don't know what the future holds, 'but we ask 
for your prayers and appreciate the privacy a family needs in such 
circumstances.'

'According 
to the medical information and advice we've received, I will be able to 
continue to balance the responsibilities of an expectant mother with 
serving as your representative in Congress,' the message continued.

Hundreds of people commented on the Beutlers' Facebook message offering their prayers and support. 

'God's blessings on all three of you,' wrote Facebook user Robin Durbin. 'I so admire your willingness to share with your constituents and others.'

Added user Heath Plunkett: 'As a family who lost a child to Potter's Syndrome, I know how heartbreaking it is to hear that news. My wife and I will keep you and your family in our prayers.'

Nearly 400 people had commented on the Beutlers' Facebook message by Tuesday afternoon, about one day after it was posted, offering their prayers and support
