At least 17 men from a small town in southern France have reportedly joined Al-Qaeda or Islamic State to fight in Syria.

Three of the men from Lunel, which has a population of just 27,500, have even taken their wives or girlfriends with them. One of them even gave birth in the war zone.

Six men from the town have died, which accounts for 10 per cent of the French jihadists killed in the conflict, Adam Sage wrote in the Times.

Five people were arrested during anti-terror raids in the Abrivado neighbourhood only last month, according to France 24.

The French Interior Minister Bernard Cazeneuve said the people arrested - aged between 26 and 44 - were 'suspected of active involvement in a jihadist network'.

He also claimed the network's members 'were recruited and indoctrinated, and who also indoctrinated and recruited several other French youngsters from Lunel'.

The town's mayor Claude Arnaud had previously doubted the existence of such a network and suspected the men were 'self-radicalised' by online propaganda.

Herault regional police office estimated as many as 50 young people had travelled to Iraq and Syria from the Languedoc-Roussillon in which Lunel lies. 

Local officials including Mayor Arnaud are struggling to understand why their quiet town has become a source of radicalisation.

It is worrying for country in the wake of the Charlie Hebdo massacre  in January and the hostage situation at a kosher supermarket that followed.

Lunel's jihadists allegedly attend a Mosque in the town's suburbs, which the government has described as a 'hotbed of fundamentalism'.

The Mosque is split between the more fanatically religious followers and opponents of the resident imam, who preaches in Arabic.

A local man who prays at the Mosque said: 'I told him to his face that we couldn't understand a word he said, and that we wanted a French imam. He told us that, in that case, we should pray in a room outside the Mosque.'

Some of the worshippers allegedly meet to discuss the suffering caused by the Syrian civil war  and encourage people to go there.

A local councillor Philippe Moissonnier said: 'These groups operate like a sect... And sects manipulate people. Once you're out there, it's easy to get you to take up arms. They turn sheep into lions.'

Once they are radicalised, they return to the now notorious Abrivados estate to coax other youngsters to join them.

The neighbourhood has produced many extremists who have gone on to fight in Syria, including two who were killed in a bomb attack last year.

The rise to fanaticism for one of the deceased fighters, Karim, was especially quick.

His neighbour said: 'He never seemed particularly religious when he was younger and used go out to nightclubs, like all the kids around here when they've got a bit of money.

'He opened a cafe, but dropped everything a couple of years ago when he found religion. The next thing I heard he was in Turkey and was heading for Syria.'

Another councillor in Lunel , Taher Akermi, said he knew most of the six men who died fighting alongside jihadists in Syria.

The distraught man said: 'This has been my work for 25 years and I feel this as a failure What am I doing here?'
