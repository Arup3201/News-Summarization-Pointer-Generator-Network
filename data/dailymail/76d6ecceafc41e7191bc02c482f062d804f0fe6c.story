Amazon is teaming up with HBO, the first streaming arrangement agreed to by the cable network, in a deal that will make available to Amazon prime members some classic TV like 'The Sopranos' and 'The Wire.'

Financial terms were not disclosed Wednesday.

The first batch of shows will appear on Prime Instant Video starting on May 21 - but will only be available in the U.S.

A new deal with Amazon will make seminal HBO shows like 'The Sopranos' available to Amazon Prime members

That date will see the release of full runs of 'The Sopranos,' 'Six Feet Under',' 'The Wire,' 'Big Love,' 'Deadwood,' 'Eastbound and Down,' 'Family Tree,' 'Enlightened,' and 'Treme.'

Early seasons of 'Boardwalk Empire' and 'True Blood' will also be available, as will the miniseries, 'Band of Brothers' and 'John Adams.'

Over time seasons of 'Girls,' 'The Newsroom,' and 'Veep' will also become available.

The companies also say that HBO's streaming service Go will likely being offered on Amazon's Fire TV by year's end.

Allowing access to HBO content without a cable subscription has been the subject of much speculation since the company launched Go for subscribers only.

In a February story, Flavorwire noted that the rapid expansion of streaming services like Netflix, which was successfully developing its own original content, had forced HBO into a position where it needed to provide a stand-alone streaming option.

This is the first time the channel's programming has been licensed to a subscription streaming service.

Full runs of series like 'The Wire' will be immediately available while other shows will receive staggered releases depending on the time elapsed since their original air dates

'HBO
 has produced some of the most groundbreaking, beloved and award-winning
 shows in television history, with more than 115 Emmys amongst the 
assortment of shows coming to Prime members next month,' Brad 
Beale, director of content acquisition for Amazon, told The Wrap.

'HBO original content
 is some of the most-popular across Amazon Instant Video — our customers
 love watching these shows. Now Prime members can enjoy a collection of 
great HBO shows on an unlimited basis, at no additional cost to their 
Prime membership.'
