They may cost hundreds of millions of dollars to build, but the U.S. Navy is parting with one of its aircraft carriers for a penny, for the second time in two years,

The Navy announced Thursday it’s paying ESCO Marine of Brownsville, Texas, one cent to take the former USS Saratoga off its hands for dismantling and recycling.

The 56,000-ton Saratoga was commissioned in 1956.

'It is emotional in that we who served on ‘Sara’ feel that our ‘surrogate mother’ is passing from our lives,' Sammy King, secretary of the USS Saratoga Association, told FoxNews.com in an email.

'We owe her a lot. We went aboard as ‘snot-nosed kids’ and left as ‘men.’ Some of us are very sad and some are very angry at the decision to scrap her.'

The carrier's aircraft flew sorties in the Vietnam War, in Operation Desert Shield and over the states of the former Yugoslavia in 1992.

In 1985, fighters from the Saratoga helped capture terrorists who hijacked the cruise ship Achille Lauro in the Mediterranean, forcing a jetliner carrying them to land at an air base in Sicily.

After the hijackers surrendered to Egyptian authorities, F-14 fighters launched from the carrier intercepted the Egyptian airliner carrying them to Tunisia and forced it to land at a NATO base in Italy.

The carrier was also part of Operation Desert Storm in 1991 and air operations over the Balkans in 1992, 1993 and 1994, according to Navy records.

Throughout its four decades of service, more than 60,000 sailors served on its decks, with roughly 5,000 at any given time

The carrier, the sixth Saratoga in U.S. history, was the second carrier built after World War II.

She was constructed at the New York Naval Shipyard of Brooklyn and was officially commissioned in 1956. Throughout its four decades of service, more than 60,000 sailors served on its decks, with roughly 5,000 at any given time.

In addition to its pivotal role in the 1962 Cuban Missile Crisis, the USS Saratoga saw duty in the Gulf of Tonkin during the Vietnam War and launched the first strikes of the Gulf War against Iraq.

It was pulled from service in 1994 and towed to Rhode Island for use as a museum ship, a plan that was never realized because of local funding issues.

It is now at Naval Station Newport in Rhode Island and is expected to be towed to Texas in the summer, the Navy said.

The Saratoga will follow the former USS Forrestal to dismantling in Texas.

That ship was towed to All Star Metals of Brownsville earlier this year, with the Navy paying a penny to the ship recyclers under a contract awarded last October.

In 1985, during a routine deployment in the Mediterranean, the Saratoga launched seven F-14 Tomcats to force a jet carrying terrorists who had just hijacked the Achille Lauro cruise ship, killing an American, to land

A year later, the ship was sailing off the Libyan coast in the Gulf of Sidra when it crossed what Libyan leader Col. Muammar Qaddafi had called the 'Line of Death'

'The price reflects the net price proposed by ESCO Marine, which considered the estimated proceeds from the sale of the scrap metal to be generated from dismantling,' the Navy said.

'This is not a sales contract, it is a procurement contract -- $0.01 is the lowest price the Navy could possibly have paid the contractor for the towing and dismantling of ex-Saratoga.'

The recyclers make money from selling the metal they salvage from the warships.

It's expected the job to dismantle the ship will take about 18 months.

A third carrier, the former USS Constellation, is expected to meet a similar fate soon.
