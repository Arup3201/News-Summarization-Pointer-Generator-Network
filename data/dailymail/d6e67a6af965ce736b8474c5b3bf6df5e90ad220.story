Charge: A 48-year-old British man faces jail after marrying a Chinese woman, despite already being wed to another woman back in the UK (file picture)

A British businessman could be jailed after his English wife reportedly found intimate pictures of his secret Chinese bride.

According to reports, the businessman, known only as 'Frank', faces up to two years in prison in China after he was charged with bigamy by a court in the city of Guangzhou, in the south east of the country.

The businessman is said to have started a relationship with a woman named by local press as Luo Ting when he arrived in China in 2005.

According to Global Times newspaper, he married the woman and had two children with her.

But the Guangzhou Daily claims that not only does 48-year-old Frank have a wife back in the UK but he also has four children.

His wife, said to be a former accountant, discovered her husband's second bride when she found 'intimate pictures and wedding photos' on his computer.

The woman, who has not been named, travelled to Guangzhou last year and reported her husband's bigamy to local police.

She later dropped the case, but police persisted and the man was eventually arrested.

According to the Daily Telegraph, the man will face a court appearance next month with a judgement expected to come in September.

His Chinese wife could also face jail if it can be proved that she had prior knowledge that he was already married.

The British Embassy in Beijing confirmed that an unnamed man had been charged with bigamy.

A spokesman confirmed it had been providing consular assistance to the man.
