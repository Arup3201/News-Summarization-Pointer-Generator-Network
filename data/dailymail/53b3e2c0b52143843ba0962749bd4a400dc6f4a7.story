He is one of the deadliest characters in gaming - an assassin feared by terrorists around the world. Glimpses of Sam Fisher have been few and far between, but this latest gameplay video shows he's lost none of his skills.

Following on from the events of Splinter Cell: Conviction, the President orders all Third Echelon members to be terminated.

New tricks ups his sleeve: The critically-acclaimed Conviction focused on action more so than the others, and Blacklist looks to take that premise further

Third Echelon have formed a terror ultimatum called 'The Blacklist' - a countdown of attacks on United Sates assets. Fourth Echelon is formed to take down the activists with Fisher at the helm.

Conviction was more action orientated than the previous games, and Ubisoft are clearly not changing that formula with Blacklist. A new mechanic called 'killing in motion' evolves the silky-smooth mark and execute function, allowing Fisher to take down multiple foes when on the run.

Interestingly, there is voice integration which allows players to distract enemies by making a noise, and Kinect sensor functionality that lets gamers move Fisher without using a controller.

Perhaps the biggest change, though, is that Michael Ironside - the voice of Sam Fisher since the 2002 original - will not be reprising his role. Smallville actor Eric Johnson takes over, providing both the voice and the motion capture.

The Splinter Cell movie has also been announced, with Inception and Bronson actor Tom Hardy taking on the lead role, with The International director, Eric Warren Singer, at the helm.

A statement on the Splinter Cell website from Jean-Julien Baronnet - Ubisoft motion pictures chief executive officer - read: ' With actor Tom Hardy attached and screenwriter Eric Warren Singer to write the script, Ubisoft Motion Pictures will lead the development with the support of New Regency to bring the franchise to the big screen in a dynamic way.

'For Ubisoft Motion Pictures, creative control is key and New Regency shares our commitment to respecting the creative freedom of our team. Their ability to produce both blockbusters and intriguing indie hits is an ideal fit for the Splinter Cell franchise.'

Splinter Cell Blacklist is released on August 23.
