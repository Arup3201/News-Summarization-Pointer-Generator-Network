All Australian children will learn an Asian language after Prime Minister Julia Gillard launched a visionary plan to help the country exploit the region's 'unstoppable' economic growth.

In a move to ensure Australia are prepared for the 'Asian Century', Ms Gillard wants to improve links with the continent by committing to 25 ambitious goals over the next 13 years.

All schoolchildren in the country will choose one of four ‘priority’ languages to learn at school – Indonesian, Japanese, Hindi and Chinese.

Ambitious: Australian Prime Minister Julia Gillard hopes that her plan to encourage all schoolchildren to speak an Asian language will improve financial links with the region

Australian schools will be partnered with Asian schools and television stations are being encouraged to air more Asian news and programmes to verse Australia's youth in knowledge of the booming region.

The measures, outlined in a government report, also include offering thousands of scholarships to Asian students and will require a third of company directors to have a ‘deep’ working knowledge of the region, according to The Daily Telegraph.

Ms Gillard said: ‘This is good news for Australia and it should drive a profound change in our thinking about our economic relationship with Asia.’

‘Children in kindergarten now will graduate from high school with a sound working knowledge of Asia.’

Asia’s economy continues to grow, and Ms Gillard is looking for more ways to harness the financial prosperity to the advantage of Australia.

Visionary: Many believe that Ms Gillard's plans are well-intentioned to improve links with areas such as Hong Kong but feel that they could have come too late

A mining boom had already been sparked by the perpetual Asian growth, yet there are growing fears that this could have peaked and may be on the decline.

China’s economy in particular continues to go from strength to strength. 

Although the growth in Beijing was the slowest since 2009 in the three months in September, it remained at a remarkably high 7.4 per cent.

Ms Gillard is not intending to lower wages to compete with the Asian workforce, but instead wants to promote tourism, education and agriculture to the growing middle classes, specifically in China.

Ms Gillard added: ‘Think of it this way: back in the ‘80s Fosters beer tried to get into China. Today it is Grange [an expensive Australian wine] carrying the flag.’

Many have backed Ms Gillard’s plans, but have said they have come too late.

Professor Andrew MacIntyre, from the Australian National University, told the Telegraph: ‘The scale of the change now is so huge.

'Australia has to adapt. We need to lift because the pace of change is not slowing down.’

Taking the plunge: Ms Gillard slipped and fell when she was visiting the Gandhi Memorial in New Delhi two weeks ago

Helped up: Ms Gillard was aided back to her feet after her heel was caught in the grass in India

Adrian Vickers, Asian Studies director at the University of Sydney, added: ‘The Asian century is already well underway. I think we have a lot of catching up to do.

‘The rapid advances in technology, in social change, in political change in Asia are things that we are struggling to keep up with as a nation.’

The British Council work to improve the opportunities for British schoolchildren to learn Chinese.

They believe that as China is now the
world's second largest economy it is vital that Britain take similar 
steps to Australia in encouraging young people to communicate in Asian 
languages, particularly Mandarin.

Martin Davidson, Chief Executive of 
the British Council and fluent Chinese speaker, said: 'The UK’s future 
prosperity depends in no small part on our ability to communicate, 
interact and build relationships with people from around the world.

Attention: Ms Gillard inspected a guard on honour at the Rashtrapati Bhavan in India, a country she wants to improve links with

'With
China recently becoming the world’s second biggest economy – and set to
continue that upward trajectory – there are few more important partners
for us. 

'A good understanding of Chinese 
language and culture will give our young people the advantage they need 
to live in a global society and compete in a global economy.'

Two weeks ago Ms Gillard, while on a 
state visit to India, got her heel caught in the grass and fell while 
visiting the Gandhi Memorial in New Delhi.

After the faux pas, as aides turned to help her up she told them: ‘I’m fine. My heel got stuck in grass.’
