Retail tycoon Sir Philip Green has sold struggling BHS for just one pound – a fraction of the £200million he paid for it almost 15 years ago.

The billionaire had failed to turn the loss-making department store chain around due to fierce competition from rivals.

It was bought yesterday by a little-known investment firm called Retail Acquisitions, raising fears for the jobs of 11,000 staff in 171 BHS stores across the country.

When asked if their roles were safe, Sir Philip said: ‘I’m a retailer, not a clairvoyant.’

The entrepreneur bought the chain in 2000 when it was called British Home Stores. It joined Topshop, Miss Selfridge, Dorothy Perkins and Burton as part of his Arcadia Group.

But its furniture and fashion – aimed at older customers – struggled to sell well enough to keep up with rivals.

Recent attempts to breathe new life into the chain included introducing food halls in some stores, opening new cafes and selling clothes from some of Arcadia’s other brands.

But this failed to kick-start growth, and BHS continued to lose customers to cheaper rivals such as IKEA, as well as more upmarket competitors including John Lewis. Sir Philip said the chain made a cash loss of £45million last year. Analysts estimate that it lost 800,000 shoppers over the past five years.

The businessman said he had not been able to give BHS as much attention as he would have liked because of the other brands he owns. ‘I don’t think anything went wrong,’ he said. ‘You try being involved in six businesses.

‘I’m not blaming anybody, but when you are in and out of the business you tend to drift. You can’t be an absentee landlord. It is a challenging marketplace and BHS is in the middle of the market at a time when everyone is discounting.’

He said the business is being handed over in a sound financial position with ‘significant’ cash balances and no debt.

Sir Philip put BHS up for sale in January. He refused to confirm the sale price yesterday, but this was widely reported as being £1. He also declined to say whether he had secured an agreement that existing stores and jobs would be safeguarded.

‘I don’t want some article saying they will close them,’ he said. ‘I’m a retailer, not a clairvoyant. People buy companies and people sell companies. They are buying the business to run it as a going concern.’

Fears have been expressed over the job security of more than 11,000 staff employed by BHS

Retail Acquisitions is a new business set up by five directors with little experience in the sector. Chairman Keith Smith, 76, is a former stockbroker. Two other directors are lawyers – one specialising in privacy, who has advised Mike Tyson, Ulrika Jonsson and Hugh Grant.

Of the firm’s remaining two directors, one is an unknown Swede and the other appears to be a former racing driver.

Mr Smith said: ‘This is a fantastic opportunity to breathe new life into this iconic British high street brand.

‘We are convinced that with strategic and focused support we will return BHS to profitability and safeguard the workforce.’

However, analysts believe the firm may be forced to cut staff.

Neil Saunders, a director of research firm Conlumino, said: ‘On the positive side, it is likely the brand will be reinvigorated and see some investment.

‘On the negative side, some restructuring [job cuts] is likely and over the medium term further store closures will likely be required.’
