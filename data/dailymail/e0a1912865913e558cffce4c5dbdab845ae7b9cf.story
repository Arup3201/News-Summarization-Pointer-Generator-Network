Peter Foster, who was jailed for life after admitting to the murder of his partner, Heather Cooper, was found hanged in his cell in the early hours of this morning at HMP Lewis

A former police detective jailed for life for murdering his partner in front of their two young children was found hanged in his cell today.

Peter Foster, 36, who was found guilty of murder last month was discovered by staff at Lewes Prison in the early hours of this morning.

Foster stabbed Detective Constable Heather Cooper, 33, before dumping her body in Blackdown Woods, near Lurgashall, West Sussex, in October last year.

His death comes after Nathan Vaughan-Jones, who stabbed his stepfather to death after a long-running family feud boiled over, was found hanged at the same prison on Friday night.

The 34-year-old had been jailed for 11 years in March after pleading guilty to the manslaughter of 63-year-old Nigel Ross on the grounds of diminished responsibility.

A Prison Service spokesman said Foster was discovered by prison staff in the early hours of this morning: 'Prison staff tried to resuscitate him and paramedics were called but he was pronounced dead at 3.25am.

'As with all deaths in custody, the Independent Prisons and Probation Ombudsman will conduct an investigation.'

It is understood Foster was on suicide watch in prison, after the former police officer had attempted to commit suicide whilst on remand before his trial.

The former Detective Constable killed Miss Cooper at the couple’s home in Haslemere, Surrey, while she was on maternity leave with her second child, who was born just weeks prior to her death.

The hearing was told he hit her over the head 10 times with a baseball bat before stabbing her in the throat.

Foster's death in the early hours of this morning comes just days after another prisoner was found hanged at HMP Lewes, pictured

Miss Cooper, who grew up in York, joined
Surrey Police in 2003 and worked in the Public Protection Investigation
Unit based at Guildford police station.

During her career she received several letters of praise from senior officers for her work on various crimes and in 2009 was given a commendation by the force for her “'professionalism, dedication and commitment.'

Sentencing Foster, Judge Richard Brown described him as an 'extremely dangerous individual' who may never be safe to be let out of prison.

He said: 'This was a wicked, savage and senseless attack on a young mother in her own home.

'Not only have you taken her life, you have also deprived Joshua and Isabel of a loving mother and, no doubt, devastated her family and friends.'

The judge added that aggravating factors were that the attack was carried out in front of the couple’s children, that the defendant was trained in martial arts, and the ferocity of the attack, which involved two weapons.

Benjamin Aina QC, prosecuting, told the court Foster carried out the attack in front of the couple’s two young children, Joshua, now three, and Isabel, who was only three months old at the time.

Foster took time to clean up the blood-soaked crime scene and took Miss Cooper’s body to the woodland, where he covered it with bracken, Mr Aina said.

He also told his cousin, David Foster, some of the details about what happened, leading him to alert the police.

The court heard that Foster then led officers to where he had hidden Miss Cooper’s body after telling them they should arrest him for murder.
