Standing in a beautiful 365-acre forest, with birds chirping and a massive, shimmering lake, it's hard to believe I'm less than an hour outside of London.

This is Woburn Forest, Center Parcs' latest holiday park – just 45 minutes from St Pancras by train; the perfect playground for those living in the capital.

MailOnline Travel is one of the first in the country to stay at the new complex, nestled in the heart of Bedfordshire, which opens to the public on June 6.

Subtropical: Woburn's new swimming pool, which is 5,200sq metres in size and cost £28m to build

Out of London: The stunning lake, surrounded by 365-acres of forest at the new Center Parcs complex

It is the brand's fifth park in the UK joining Sherwood, Longleat, Whinfell and Elveden - and this is the closest one to London.

For Center Parcs aficionados, there’s all the usual trimmings you would expect to find; the vast, family-friendly complex boasting pretty much every outdoor – and indoor - activity you could want.

There are also a few surprises and twists in store to keep this new site, which cost £250m to build, fresh and exciting; including £12m spa, Center Parcs’ largest Subtropical Swimming Paradise, and a gift shop selling £2,000 watches!

As well as 625 self-catering lodges in the traditional Center Parcs style, there’s also a new, 75-room luxury hotel, for those who prefer someone else to do the cooking.

Grand tour: There are more than 100 activities available at the new park - including Segway rides

Luxury accommodation: Inside one of the self-catering lodges at the new holiday park in Bedfordshire

Shooting range: Glyn and Callum trying their hand at clay pigeon shooting

With my husband Glyn and son Callum, we check-in to our New Style Exclusive cabin, which has three bedrooms, an open-plan kitchen, and a lounge as well as a Jacuzzi in the ensuite.

It even boasts a traditional wood sauna, a rainforest shower in the garden, and daily maid service.

'This is the life,' my eight-year-old says cheekily as he packs his bag ready for the day's first activity.

The park is perfect for kids, with non-stop activities – from archery, canoeing and laser combat, to falconry, pottery painting and tennis.

We’re packing him off for a three-hour slot of Princesses and Pirates - an afternoon of dressing up, songs and crafts with other children. 

My husband and I opt to check out the Aqua Sana Spa – we’ll get our fill of the great outdoors afterwards.

And relax... The infinity pool at Aqua Sana spa, which cost £12m to build

Open plan dining: The lounge area inside an Executive Lodge at the new £250m holiday park

Dining out: A nighttime view of some of the 13 restaurants and cafes on offer at the new park

Inside is a range of hot to ice-cold rain rooms, saunas, steam rooms, relaxation areas and sensory rooms, where we spend two hours relaxing, inhaling wonderful fragrances from herbs and essential oils.

Fully pampered, and Callum still racing with energy, the three of us hire bikes and cycle carefree around the park, safe in the knowledge that cars are banned other than on Mondays and Fridays – guest change-over days.

The 5,200sq-metre Subtropical Swimming Paradise - which cost £28m - is our next stop.

Inside there is a wave pool, flumes, slides, Wild Water Rapids, Lazy River, Wild Water Rapids and three water rides – as well as nearly 5,000 stunning tropical plants that were rescued from areas threatened by deforestation in South East Asia.

With snorkel in hand and flip flops on our feet we set about deciding what to go on first.

Water activities: The boating lake surrounded by the 365-acre Woburn forest

Water slides: The new £28m subtropical swimming pool boasts tubes, rapids and waves

I find myself lining up for the Tornado – the ‘family’ raft ride. The life guard assures me it’s fine and not too scary. 

After what feels like a sheer drop at high speed, my legs go to jelly and I decide that I may well just stick to swimming for the rest of the day. 

Callum’s happy floating around the rapids, and my courage builds enough to try the Twister and Tornado rides on a double inflatable ring – embarrassingly, I end up screaming louder than the children.

As the Tarzan call sounds, signalling the start of the waves, everyone rushes into the pool to be thrashed about. I find a quiet corner to recover and relax. 

In the evening, there are a range of 13 restaurants and cafes to choose from, serving cuisine from around the world including high-street chains such as Strada, Cafe Rouge, and Starbucks.

Also on offer is the chance to have a meal prepared for you and delivered to your cabin, giving guests the opportunity to put their feet up after a hard day on the rapids.

Non-stop activity: Bikes are the best way to get around the new Center Parcs in Woburn

There’s also evening entertainment suitable for young ones, and I find myself being wrapped up in tissue paper for the ‘Mummy’ game – and that was before the cocktails.

The following morning there’s still lots of activities - 100 in total - on offer.

Callum and I find ourselves on a spontaneous roller skating session – but he fares better than I do.

Then we jump on our bikes again, overtaking a group of Sedway riders who are exploring the vast park as well.

Our last stop is the Outdoor Activity Centre for a spot of Laser Clay Pigeon Shooting.

Glyn and Callum are excited at playing a real-life PlayStation game, while I laze in the sun, safe in the knowledge that the drive home is only going to take us an hour.

Our first family stay at Center Parcs has been a whirlwind experience – and I know my son is going to be begging me to come back again.

And when it's a £250m playground that's right on your doorstep, it's that much easier to say yes.

A stay at the new Woburn Forest Center Parcs (08448 266266; centerparcs.co.uk/woburn) costs from £399 for a four-night midweek break in a two-bedroom Woodland Lodge, from £799 for a four-bedroom Executive Lodge, or £1,399 for a top-of-the-range four-bedroom new-style Exclusive Lodge.
