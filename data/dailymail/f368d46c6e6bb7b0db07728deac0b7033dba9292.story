David Cameron will today announce further details of British troop withdrawals from Afghanistan - and insists any short-term pull outs will be 'modest.'

In a statement to the Commons following a two-day visit to Kabul and Helmand, the Prime Minister will reiterate his commitment to end the UK's combat role in the conflict by 2015.

However, he stressed during the trip that any short-term pullouts would be 'modest', saying there would be no 'radical change' in numbers for the next year.

Some 450 mainly auxiliary British personnel are already scheduled to be withdrawn in the coming months. Weekend reports suggested Mr Cameron was to announce a further 500 next year.

It comes as Mr Cameron yesterday called on the Taliban to enter talks - and said that the discussions in Northern Ireland 
showed even 'those who maim and bomb can join the peace process'.

His speech delivered his most direct appeal yet to Taliban elements 
to join in with the political process.

'It is very difficult to reconcile with people who have been killing your own soldiers, or your own countrymen,' he said.

'To the Taliban, the message is very 
clear: Stop killing, stop bombing, stop fighting, put down your weapons,
join the political process and you can be part of the future of this 
country.

Staying put: David Cameron will tell the House of Commons today that no more than 500 troops will leave before autumn 2012

'I have seen it in my own country, in
Northern Ireland, where people who were involved in trying to kill, to 
maim and bomb civilians and police officers, army personnel and even 
politicians have actually become politicians themselves and are involved
in the governance of that country.

'It can happen and the message to the Taliban is: you cannot win this fight, you are losing this fight.'

The Government has been under pressure to follow the example of US President Barack Obama, who announced last month that 10,000 troops deployed as part of the so-called 'surge' strategy would be coming home by the end of this year, and another 23,000 next.

After public concerns from a series of senior military figures, Mr Cameron has played down the prospects of a significant pullout soon.

British levels - currently at about 9,500 - were 'not going to see a radical change for the fighting season of next year', he added.

The Prime Minister's visit coincided with the death of another UK soldier, named last night as Highlander Scott McLaren of 4th Battalion, The Royal Regiment of Scotland.

The 20-year-old had earlier disappeared from a Nato checkpoint in central Helmand, sparking a massive 17-hour search.

Mr Cameron acknowledged the 'high price' the UK had paid in seeking to help stabilise Afghanistan and prevent it reverting to a haven for terrorists.

At a press conference in Kabul yesterday, the Prime Minister restated his determination to have UK forces off the front line within four years.

'I have always been clear that the end of 2014 is a deadline. We will not be here in large numbers or in a combat role,' he said.

'If what we are doing was not working by then then I think you would have some serious questions to ask me.'

He went on: 'This is a matter of judgement. It is my judgement that it is right for the British public to know, for the Afghan public to know, for the Afghan and the British military to know, that there is an endpoint to this.

'An endpoint after which we will still be training, we will still be helping, but we won't be in a combat role.'

Mr Cameron insisted that the planned transition to Afghan security control in the provincial capital of Lashkar Gah later this month remained on track.

'I do believe it is the right time,' he said.

'Many things have to be got right to ensure that transition can be done properly. But I believe we are on track. It can be done.'
