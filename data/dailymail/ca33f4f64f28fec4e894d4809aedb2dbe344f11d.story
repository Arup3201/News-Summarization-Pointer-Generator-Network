Under then-Secretary Hillary Clinton, the U.S. State Department repeatedly refused to add the Nigerian al-Qaeda affiliate group Boko Haram – the organization responsible for the recent kidnapping of more than 300 young girls – to its official list of terrorist organizations.

In November 2013, current Secretary John Kerry did what Clinton wouldn't.

Boko Haram is the group that has claimed responsibility for kidnapping hundreds of girls in Nigeria, promising to sell them into slavery.

The Daily Beast reported Thursday that in 2011, after the group's mass-murderers bombed the United Nations building in Abuja, Nigeria, Obama administration agencies and more than a dozen members of Congress begged Clinton to add it to its official list of designated terror organizations – but the State Department fought it and did nothing.

Former Secretary Hillary Rodham Clinton offered tepid condemnation of Boko Haram on Wednesday night, hours before it emerged that her State Department refused to designate the group as terrorists

Clinton jumped on the hashtag bandwagon on Sunday but hasn't addressed why the mass-murdering organization wasn't named a terror group on her watch

The urging came from the Justice Department, the Central Intelligence Agency, the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the head of the U.S. military's Africa Command (AFRICOM).

Now with Boko Haram in the international spotlight and Clinton positioning herself for a presidential run, she has forcefully demanded U.S. government action to fight against the Islamist group.

'Access to education is a basic right & an unconscionable reason to target innocent girls. We must stand up to terrorism,' she tweeted on Sunday.

'Boko Haram' is a loose translation of the Hausa-language phrase 'Western education is sinful.'

She said Wednesday night during a Ford Foundation event in New York City that 'the government of Nigeria has been, in my view, somewhat derelict in its responsibility for protecting boys and girls, men and women.'

'They need to make it a priority to do everything they can to try to bring these girls home safely,' Clinton said, 'and that, I believe, requires assistance from others including the United States.'

That tepid condemnation, a day after she called the kidnappings 'an abominable ... act of terror,' stands in sharp contrast to those of some who served with her in Congress.

'These kidnappings are barbaric and gutless,' New York Democratic Sen. Chuck Schumer told the New York Post.

'Boko Haram is a particularly evil and vicious component of the Islamic terrorist network,' added New York Republican Rep. Peter King.

'Hypocrisy': Clinton, now ramping up for a possible White House run, is urging the U.S. government to do what she wouldn't just a few years ago

Sen. James Risch, an Idaho Republican, told The Daily Beast that Clinton missed the opportunity to enable the U.S. government to do more – a possibility that designating Boko Haram as a terror group would have opened up.

Nigerian President Goodluck Jonathan said Thursday that his government considers the abduction of hundreds of schoolgirls a turning point in his fight against Islamist terror groups

'For years, Boko Haram has terrorized Nigeria and Western interests in the region with few consequences,” Risch said.

'The U.S. government should have moved more quickly to list them as a terrorist organization and brought U.S. resources to track and disrupt their activities. The failure to act swiftly has had consequences.'

The online news outlet quoted an unnamed former senior U.S. official taking the suddenly alarmed Clinton to the woodshed even more strongly.

'The one thing she could have done, the one tool she had at her disposal, she didn’t use,' the official reportedly said. 'And nobody can say she wasn’t urged to do it. It’s gross hypocrisy.'

In a March 2012 letter to Clinton, Rep. King and fellow Republican Pat Meehan explained that the group had 'intensified its campaign of terrorism, including detonating a vehicle borne improvised explosive device (VBIED) at a Catholic church during Christmas Day mass.'

'The group also conducted a series of attacks in January 2012 throughout Nigeria that killed dozens,' they wrote. 'These attacks follow the August 26, 2011 bombing of the U.N. headquarters in Abuja that killed 23 and injured 100.'

'According to Human Rights Watch, Boko Haram has killed more than 900 people in the last two years. The brazenness and sophistication of these attacks are hallmarks of al Qaeda tradecraft.'

Meehan, along with Democratic Rep. Jackie Speier, published a scathing report on Boko Haram in November 2011.

It found that the vicious organization 'has quickly evolved and poses an emerging threat to U.S. Interests and the U.S. homeland.'

'Boko Haram has the intent and may be developing capability to coordinate on a rhetorical and operational level with al Qaeda in the Lands of the Islamic Maghreb (AQIM) and Al Shabaab,' it reported.

This week the group massacred hundreds in a northeast Nigerian town.
