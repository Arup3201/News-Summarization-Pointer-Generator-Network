John Terry insists Chelsea's strength in depth is the main reason for his side's success so far this season.

The Blues have strolled through to the Champions League last 16 and the Capital One Cup semi-final while maintaining top spot in the Premier League.

Despite a difficult trip to Stoke to come on Monday night, Terry believes the Blues squad is strong enough to cope with any challenge.

He told the Sunday Mirror: 'They probably don't come any tougher than Stoke away. But we are doing well and it's important we go into games doing the dogged stuff, putting our bodies on the line.

'The strength in depth of the squad (is the difference'). This season we are winning games that maybe we drew last season.

'We speak among outselves about regrouping and going againg.'

The Chelsea captain, who has been at Chelsea since of age of 14, also believes that Serbian midfielder Nemanja Matic has been key to Chelsea's good form.

Matic re-signed for Chelsea in January and has been a brilliant foil to the talent and flair of Cesc Fabregas in the Chelsea midfield, drawing comparisons to for Blues enforcer Claude Makelele.

Terry added: 'You look at the exciting days when the manager first came, and Claude Makelele was the master in that position where Matic plays and Matic is very close to that.

'We missed him at Newcastle.'
