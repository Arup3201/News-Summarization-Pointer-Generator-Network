A shocking video has captured the moment an engineering student in India jumps inside a zoo's tiger enclosure and antagonises two tigers before managing to escape unhurt.

Yashonandan Kaushik, 23, from Madhya Pradesh, India, surprised fellow visitors at Gwalior Zoo on Monday afternoon when he suddenly scaled a 20 foot wall and jumped inside the tiger enclosure.

Spectators are heard shouting at him but he ignores them and continues to take off his shirt before challenging the tigers for a fight and trying to chase one into its cave.

Zoo officials believe wild animals born in captivity rarely get aggressive and attack people.

Police were going to charge Yashonandan with suicide - a serious crime in India - but his father, Ashok Kaushik, assured the police that he would be taken to a medical centre for psychiatric counselling.  

Officer Narayn Singh, at Inderganj Police Station, said: 'The boy had been missing from home for about five days. He is mentally unstable and needs medical assistance. His parents will now take charge of him.’
