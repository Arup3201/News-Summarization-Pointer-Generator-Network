According to callers, the 111 line is not picking up calls quickly enough

The extent of the new NHS non-emergency advice line’s teething problems have been laid bare after official figures revealed a stark rise in abandoned calls.

The number of people who hung up after waiting for a response for more than 30 seconds increased from 6,976 in February to 29,100 in March, according to NHS England figures.

And the average call length also increased from 14.19 minutes in February to almost 18 minutes in March.

However, while the number of abandoned calls rose, the number of calls to the line increased by more than half a million within the same timeframe too.

Last week, leading doctors warned that the 'problematic' roll-out of the NHS 111 advice line had left patients not knowing where to turn to for help.

The Royal College of General Practitioners said patients have 'lost confidence' in the new non-emergency number before it is even fully up and running across the country.

The service was planned to be rolled out on April 1, but officials were forced to postpone the deadline after it emerged that many of the advice lines - which are run by 44 individual local bodies across the country - were not ready to 'go live'.

And, more than a month on, seven of the regional bodies are still not ready to start giving advice to patients in their areas.

Patients have complained about calls going unanswered and poor advice being given, especially at weekends, which has led to hospitals being inundated with patients who could be treated elsewhere.

Today Health minister Earl Howe hit out at the quality of the some of the operators of the 111 line but claimed that across most of England people were getting a 'good' or 'fantastic' service.

Frustration: Those calling the new NHS 111 helpline say that they are being given substandard advice, especially at weekends

At question time in the House of Lords, Lord Howe said: 'We recognise that the NHS 111 launches in March did not go as smoothly as planned and a number of providers have delivered an unacceptable service, especially at weekends.

'NHS England is working closely with clinical commissioning groups to stabilise providers who have failed to deliver an effective service and to ensure those areas yet to go live are in a safe and fit state to do so.'

But shadow health minister Lord Hunt of Kings Heath demanded: “On what grounds was the decision made to go ahead with the national roll-out in the light of the results from the pilot which showed problems with the scheme and the fact that many people in the NHS advised ministers and NHS England that it should not have been rolled out because it was not ready to be rolled out?'

Lord Howe said Sheffield University had carried out research on the pilots which suggested high levels of satisfaction and that the service was sending people to the right places.

'On that basis it was considered safe to go ahead with the roll-out.

'Unfortunately, in particular areas of the country the resources deployed to meet the demand have not been accurately assessed,' he added.

'Across the vast bulk of England people are getting a good if not fantastic service.

'Unfortunately, in two particular areas of the country - the South East and South West - we are still seeing the problems arising.'
