Treavor Eimers says his father had moved from Michigan to Key West to live out his days enjoying the beach, but his retirement came to an abrupt and tragic end during a routine traffic stop last year.

Charles Eimers, a retired 61-year-old autoworker, died in police custody after being arrested outside a Pizza Hut in Key West last Thanksgiving.

'He was murdered by those officers,' his son told CBS This Morning.

Eimers was pulled over November 28, 2013, outside a Pizza Hut on North Roosevelt Boulevard in Key West for reckless driving

What followed Mr Eimers' sudden passing was a series of conflicting reports from law enforcement officials, paramedics and the hospital, leading Treavor Eimers to suspect that there might be a cover-up afoot.

Charles Eimers' deadly encounter with Key West police November 28 was caught on video recorded by a passerby, which shows the man emerging from his car on his own and then surrendering by laying face-down on the beach.

The footage shows a group of more than a dozen officers surrounding the prostrate man and forming a wall around him. 

In a police report, the 13 officers wrote that Eimers was pulled over outside the Pizza Hut on North Roosevelt Boulevard for reckless driving, but he fled the scene. The documents stated that the 61-year-old man was charged with resisting an officer with violence.

But a report filed by paramedics who responded to the scene stated that a police officer told EMT workers that Eimers ran from his car and then collapsed unconscious on the beach.

Conflicting stories: Officers wrote in their reports that the 61-year-old man violently resisted arrest, but an EMT claimed that one of the cops told him Eimers collapsed unconscious on the beach

Then again, hospital records obtained by CBS indicated that the 61-year-old retiree 'was found without a pulse by police' and later passed away from lack of oxygen to the brain.

But the eyewitness video shot with a cell phone clearly shows Charles Eimers walking by himself and calmly surrendering to armed police officers.

The man was taken to Lower Keys Medical Center and placed on life support, but according to Treavor Eimers, he was not notified about his father's hospitalization until four days later in violation of standing police procedures.

After the son ordered his father taken off the respirator, he says he was certain that a medical examiner would evaluate his body under a state law requiring an autopsy on anyone who dies in police custody.

Close call: After his son took Eimers off life support, his body was supposed to be autopsied, but instead it was taken directly to this funeral home and nearly cremated

But instead of sending his remains to the medical examiner's office, police shipped Charles Eimers directly to a funeral home where the deceased narrowly avoided cremation. 

Monroe County Medical Examiner E. Hunt Scheuerman eventually autopsied Eimers' body, concluding in his preliminary report released to Miami Herald last month that the 61-year-old Michigan transplant suffered 10 broken ribs and bruises on both his wrists from the handcuffs.

‘I believe that my father was asphyxiated on the beach in Key West by the officers involved that day,’ said Eimers’ son, a former critical care nurse.

The Key West site TheBluePaper.com, which has been following the case, reported that Eimers' tissue samples have been destroyed.

In the week after the arrest, some of the 13 officers involved in the case submitted additional reports stating that the 61-year-old violently struggled to get free.

Treavor Eimers said his father's record was far from spotless, with multiple run-ins with the law in the 1990s on charges of domestic abuse and theft, but he cannot understand how a simple traffic stop could have resulted in his death.

Both the Key West Police Department and the Florida Department of Law Enforcing have been investigating the Eimers case over the past six months.

‘We want to be able to provide answers to the Eimers family. We want to provide answers to this community. And we want the police officers who are involved to be able to move on from this situation as well.’ Key West Police Chief Donald Lee Jr told CBS.

However, Eimers' family and other critics of the law enforcement officials handing the case have pointed to a possible conflict of interest stemming from the fact that lead investigator, Kathy Smith, is the ex-wife of Captain Scott Smith, the supervisor of the arresting officers.
