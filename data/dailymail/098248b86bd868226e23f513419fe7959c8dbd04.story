Thousands of people were forced to go through security queues at Stansted Airport twice after an apparent 'mix up' which confused arriving passengers with those waiting to board flights. 

Staff insisted on evacuating the entire international departures lounge when a 'small number' of passengers who had just landed on a Ryanair flight from Lisbon on Sunday mistakenly entered it through the wrong door.  

Huge queues formed throughout the airport, with crowds bemoaning having to wait up to two hours in security queues to be let back through to their gates. 

Thousands were delayed and forced to queue for security again after a 'mix-up' at Stansted Airport

The departure's lounge was left empty for around 90 minutes, thwarting scores of flights due to take off. 

Staff said the confusion came about when passengers on the Lisbon flight walked through the wrong door, leading them to the departures lounge rather than the arrivals gate. 

'The crew of this flight correctly directed disembarking customers to the assigned gate, however they entered the airport through a door which had been left open in error,' a spokesman for the airline said on Monday.

'Ryanair fully cooperated with Stansted Airport as it rescreened departing passengers. A number of flights were delayed throughout the day due to earlier issues with deicing facilities. 

The incident will be the subject of an investigation, he added.

Disgruntled passengers took to Twitter to complain about the delays which offset scores of journeys

Disgruntled passengers took to social media to share their fury, with some complaining of queues of two hours. 

'Ongoing security "issue" at Stansted Airport. Massive queues as no one can get through security. Communication over PA has not been great,' said Duncan McKay. 

James Carter added: 'Massive security queues at Stansted, again. Been in line for two hours now.' 

A spokesman for Ryanair said the mishap came about when staff left the wrong door open for passengers

Sunday was one of the busiest travelling days of the month, with thousands returning to the UK to head back to work after the Christmas break.

Others arriving at Heathrow Airport on Sunday evening reported long queues as they waited for passport control.

One passenger waited for 90 minutes at the airport's Terminal 5, while others complained of flight delays due to severe fog.
