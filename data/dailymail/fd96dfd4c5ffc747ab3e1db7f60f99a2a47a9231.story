A prolific thief who raided the hotel suite of Chelsea boss Jose Mourinho and stole more than £100,000-worth of his wife's designer jewellery was on licence at the time, it has emerged.

A court heard Jamie Filan, 32, had also targeted the suite of a wealthy businessman in the Savoy just three days before he crept into Mourinho's penthouse at the five-star Wyndham Grand Hotel in Chelsea, stuffed the gems into one of the manager's Louis Vuitton suitcases, and left the scene in a taxi.

Filan, who was jailed for 31 months in May after he admitted burgling the suite while Mourinho was on business and his wife and daughter were out shopping, was brought back to Southwark Crown Court today and jailed for a total of four years after owning up to a string of other raids on five-star hotels.

'Persistent offender': A judge told Filan he had an 'appalling' record of convictions as jailed him for four years at Southwark Crown Court today

Filan, described in court as having an 'appalling' record of convictions, was on licence when he targeted Mourinho's suite after having been released earlier this year from a sentence for a domestic burglary in 2012.

He bypassed tight security to help himself to gold jewellery, a diamond pendant, computer equipment, and an Ermenegildo Zegna coat, worth £1,850, belonging to the Chelsea boss.

Victims: Filan stole jewellery worth tens of thousands belonging to Matilde Mourinho (pictured leaving a London restaurant with the Chelsea boss last night), the wife of football manager Jose

Prosecutor Usha Shergill said today Filan 
posed as genuine guest at the five-star Savoy Hotel to get into the room
of businessman Soven Hansen. 'He approached two members of staff who were part of the cleaning team and casually asked them what time they would complete cleaning the room', she told the court. 'It led them to believe he was the occupant of room 421. 'He entered the room and later seen leaving the room with an orange plastic bag containing quite a significant amount of property.' Filan stole a Louis Vuitton purse worth £100, Sony photographic equipment, a Tom Tom sat-nav system, and a brand new iPad worth £2,000. He later told police he sold the goods on Edgware Road in a bid to clear £7,000 worth of debt.

Lavish: Jose Mourinho was away on business and his wife and daughter were out shopping when Filan burgled their suite escaping with more than £100,000 worth of goods

Filan had scoured the hotel looking for a way into the room, and is thought to have found a keycard in a janitor's cupboard. 'CCTV footage shows Mr Filan entering the hotel, and he was then seen to enter a blue lift up to the fourth floor', Ms Shergill said. 'Earlier footage shows Mr Filan entering the janitor's cupboard, and the only inference for this is he managed to obtain a swipe card to gain access to the room in question.' She added: 'One can only imagine the tremendous inconvenience the loser of the property must have experienced, having lost not just personal items but also a computer containing lots of information and data. 'He planned the burglary and clearly went with the intention of stealing, embarking on some form of deception.'

Filan confessed to that raid on March 23, and asked for two other raids - on the Renaissance Hotel in St Pancras, on February 28 and the Landmark London Hotel in Marylebone, on March 27 - to be taken into consideration.

During those other burglaries, he got away with £3,800 worth of goods, but was later identified on CCTV as a well-known thief. Filan had targeted Mourinho, then still in charge at Real Madrid, on March 26, just three days after he and his family checked in to their hotel suite. In that raid, he helped himself to a Cartier pendant, earrings and a ring worth £51,450, which the soccer star had given to his wife Matilde as gifts. A Bulgari white gold watch and earrings worth £30,450, together with a £14,900 Van Cleef and Arpels gold bracelet; a Tiffany 18ct white gold diamond cross pendant, worth £2,450; a Boucheron yellow, white and pink gold ring, valued at £4,600; and a pair of Chaumet 18ct white gold diamond earrings, worth £2,750, were also taken. 

Wealthy clientele: Three days before the raid on Mourinho's suite in Chelsea, Filan had targeted a wealthy businessman at London's Savoy Hotel, a court heard

Brazen Filan then stuffed the haul into one of Mourinho's Louis Vuitton suitcases and casually asked hotel staff to order him a taxi.

In 2007 Filan was jailed for five years for running over and killing dental nurse Michelle Dever in Lancing, West Sussex.

Filan was then let out in June 2009 and hit the headlines after bragging on Facebook about jet-skiing, quad-biking and nightclubbing in Ibiza while on licence.

The court heard Filan has 22 previous convictions for 55 offences, and is currently a serving prisoner at HMP Wandsworth.

His latest crime spree finally came to an end on April 13 when he raided a suite at the exclusive Four Seasons in Hamilton Place, Park Lane.

Security staff spotted him returning the following day to try to break into another room at the same hotel, and detained him.

Filan, who was known to use the alias 'Jimmy Dormer', is already banned from entering any hotel in the City of London and the City of Westminster for five years upon his release from jail.

Judge Stephen Robbins jailed him for four years today, to run concurrently with his existing 31 month jail term.

'Your antecedents show an appalling record of convictions', said the judge.

'You are a persistent offender.' Filan, formerly of Westminster and now of Peterborough, admitted one count of burglary with two other offences to be taken into consideration.
