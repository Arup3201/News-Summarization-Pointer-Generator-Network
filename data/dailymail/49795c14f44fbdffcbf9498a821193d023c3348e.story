Mo Farah has pulled out of the Great Edinburgh XCountry international challenge because of illness.

The 5,000 metres and 10,000m Olympic champion was due to compete for Great Britain and Northern Ireland against the United States and Europe at Holyrood Park on Saturday.

Farah told Athletics Weekly: 'Unfortunately I have to cancel my participation in the Great Edinburgh XCountry as I had the flu over the Christmas and New Year period and had to take some days off training.

'My main goal for 2015 is the IAAF World T&F Championships in Beijing and I will keep training hard to defend my 5000m and 10,000m titles.'

Farah also withdrew from last year's Commonwealth Games due to illness before winning double gold at the European Championships.
