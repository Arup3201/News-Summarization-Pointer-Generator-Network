Procedures used by Gwyneth Paltrow could cost around £14,000 a month but a new report suggests same effects can be had for £150

The idea of chewing on a selection of garden weeds with a sprinkling of crushed seeds is enough to put most of us off our supper.

But for health-obsessed actress Gwyneth Paltrow, these are key ingredients in her January detox diet.

The Oscar-winner, 42, has released a bizarre seven-day meal plan through her lifestyle website Goop.

She promises that, when paired with colonic irrigation and trips to infra-red saunas, the diet will help devotees lose weight and remove ‘heavy metals and pesticides’ from the body. 

But this weekend, two of her areas of expertise - food and skincare - have been criticised in the press. 

One national newspaper has suggested her multi-thousand pound skincare routine can be bought for a fraction of the price, while another has reported that her detox could leave users out of pocket and possibly unable to sleep from hunger. 

Gwyneth has long been admired for her youthful complexion - the 42-year-old could easily pass for a woman ten years younger on any day. 

Unsurprisingly though, sipping from the fountain of youth doesn't come cheap and last week, the Daily Mail revealed the star's  beauty regime costs an eye-watering £14,000-a-month.

But a new report has suggested that it is possible to roll back the years like Gwyneth, for as little as £150 every four weeks. 

According to the Sunday Times, Gwyneth's luxury skin therapies can be bought for much less from high street stores.

From holistic treatments to weekly facials, not to mention the services of a hair stylist and make-up artist for personal appearances, Miss Paltrow’s regime does not come cheap.

The mother-of-two is said to enjoy Reiki stress reduction massage on a monthly basis, which typically costs £185 for 90 minutes, resulting in an annual spend of as much as £2,220.

But Pilates classes claim to have similar benefits.

For just £80 a month in many towns across the UK, Pilates teachers claim their classes help with not just stress relief, but also alignment, strength, flexibility, tone and endurance.

The Oscar-winning actress is also said to be a fan of the intravenous vitamin therapy at the Be Hive of Healing centre in Los Angeles. 

Costing up to £289 per session, it is estimated Miss Paltrow has at least one a month and could easily hand over as much as £3,500 a year. 

The Goop diet: Two 'detox days' from the diet

The Sunday Times claim that many of the same benefits can be had from a packet of vitamin supplements that costs roughly £5 a month from any local supermarket.

The Iron Man star, whose net worth is estimated at £40 million, is also believed to indulge twice a year in Thermage laser treatment on her face, brows and neck, thought to cost almost £17,000. 

In between these sessions, Miss Paltrow – who split from Coldplay’s Chris Martin last year – heads to Tracie Martyn for facials when she is in New York, where she thinks nothing of paying almost £1,500 a year for microdermabrasion, electronic muscle stimulation and oxygen-mist treatment.

She is also believed to enjoy an apple stem cell facial – at around £300 a session or £12,000 a year at Sonya Dakar in LA.

But according to award-winning beauty blogger Mikhila McDaid, low cost beauty products can be just as effective as the more expensive items. 

She told the paper that Montagne Jeunesse  mud pacs, which can be bought from high street chemist Boots for £1 a sachet, cause the skin to glow in a similar way to many costly beauty treatments.

The newspaper also took aim at the hair salon treatments and trims that are estimated to cost Miss Paltrow around £6,000 a year. 

Before she invested in a chain of blow-dry bars this year, she was also paying for weekly blow drys, which were thought to cost her almost £100 each – or around £5,000 a year. 

Gwyneth's expensive beauty regime isn't the only part of her maintenance routine coming under fire though.Her January detox, which has recently been published on her lifestyle blog Goop , has now been criticised by nutritionists 

They pointed out that it is easy to find a salon that does a cut and blow-dry for £45 a session and that they only need to be topped up every six weeks at the most. 

In fact, a set of highlights, followed by a cut and blow dry can be found for as little as £29 is using a voucher website like Groupon. 

Gwyneth's expensive beauty regime isn't the only part of her maintenance routine coming under fire though. 

Her January detox, which has recently been published on her lifestyle blog Goop, has now been criticised by nutritionists.

The detailed seven-day plan, which is designed to rid the body of Christmas toxins, recommends beetroot and coriander juice for breakfast, red lentil soup for lunch and chicken salad for dinner on day one, with a snack of rice cakes and almond butter. 

Day three suggests smoothie for breakfast, soup and half a baked sweet potato for lunch and Seared Halibut with Lentils, Kale, and Salsa Verde for dinner, with more rice cakes for a snack. 

But the Sunday Telegraph reports that the diet could leave people too hungry to sleep and also out of pocket if they try to buy the rare ingredients involved in some of the recipes. 

Dr Carina Norris, a registered nutritionist, told the paper: 'If you are not used to this kind of eating you would find yourself hungry at times you wouldn't expect and it could be very hard to sustain and end up falling off the wagon altogether and eating a whole packet of biscuits or reaching for a tub of ice cream.

'The whole detox idea is not necessary because if your liver and kidneys are in good working order, they are your detox organs.'
