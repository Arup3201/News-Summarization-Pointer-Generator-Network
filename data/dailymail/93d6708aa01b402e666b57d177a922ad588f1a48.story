Taliban-costumed Chris Brown be warned.

An Ohio University student group is protesting against ‘racially insensitive’ Halloween outfits that promote ethnic and other politically incorrect stereotypes.

The group, Students Teaching About Racism in Society (STARS), has made its views clear on potentially offensive costumes in its second annual Halloween poster campaign, ‘We’re a culture, not a costume.’

Chris Brown and his friends caused a stir this Halloween by attending a fancy dress party dressed as Taliban soldiers

The group’s website shows posters of various people looking sad and frustrated and wearing mostly black clothing, depicted next to other people laughing and smiling and wearing costumes that mock their respective cultures.

In one poster a young Hispanic man is holding up a photo of someone dressed up as a cartoonish Mexican riding a donkey with a caption that reads: ‘This is not who I am, and this is not ok.’

In another poster a young white man is superimposed next to someone dressed up as a bumpkin playing the banjo with a caption that reads:

‘You wear the costume for one night, I wear the stigma for life.’

The group has made its views clear for a second year

All posters carry the slogan 'I wear the stigma for life'

The STARS poster campaign has gained some traction

The STARS poster campaign follows recent public outrage at commercial chain stores for selling offensive Halloween outfits.

In
2009 Target pulled a controversial ‘Illegal Alien’ costume from its 
store shelves after a human rights group called the costume 
‘distasteful, mean-spirited, and ignorant.’

On Wednesday pop celebrity Chris Brown and friends dressed up as Taliban soldiers, sparking public fury.

The
STARS poster campaign has gained some traction since it launched last 
year. The movement has spread to Florida State University, where several
students back the group’s message, FOX News reports.

But not everyone sees the poster campaign as a progressive step forward.

'These [costumes] are all portrayals which take place in film and television all the time,' Florida State University senior Gavin Benner told FSU News. 'There will always be people who are being irresponsible and intentionally offensive, but that is the vast minority. When you take into account that everyone has a freedom to expression, then I believe it isn’t anyone’s place to suppress that.'
