Printed books made a surprise comeback this Christmas after figures revealed the strongest week of sales in three years.

The autobiographies of TV star Miranda Hart and Olympic cyclist Bradley Wiggins were believed to be key factors in the surge of book-buying in the Christmas rush.

Physical books have seen dwindling sales in recent years due to the increased use of e-readers and tablets, but this Christmas their fortunes were reversed.

The industry saw takings of £75.4million in the week ending December 22 - up by 20 per cent on the previous week and £1.4million higher than the same period in 2011.

Most popular was Jamie Oliver's 15-Minute Meals, which sold 140,155 copies in the UK last week.

Second was comic Miranda Hart's Is It Just Me?, in which the star looks back on her childhood, followed by Bradley Wiggins's account of his journey through the Tour de France and the Olympics.

The titles sold 64,691 and 59,524 copies respectively.

Writer William Dalrymple, who authored Nine Lives: In Search of the Sacred in Modern India,  was among those who welcomed the news.

He said on Twitter: 'Real books fighting back!'

Antony Beevor, whose books include The Second World War and Stalingrad, told the Guardian: 'This looks to be positive in many ways but the question is, what are the figures for sales of serious fiction,' he said.

'I would fear they are down quite considerably, and that is probably true of serious books across the board.'

He added part of the attraction of celebrity memoirs was due to the pictures.

The Guinness World Records 2013 came in at fourth place, while a film tie-in version of JRR Tolkien's The Hobbit was fifth.

Industry figures show that physical book sales in the UK have fallen every year since hitting a peak of £1.8bn in 2007, when the final Harry Potter book was released.
