Environmental activist Emma Sheppard has been told she is likely to be jailed for setting three nail traps outside the Bristol police station that punctured the tyres of response cars

An environmental activist who used nail-filled pieces of plywood to put three police cars responding to emergency calls out of action is likely to be jailed.

Emma Sheppard positioned three of the homemade traps outside a police station near Bristol on New Year's Eve, which led to the police vehicles' tyres being punctured. The devices were similar to those used by police to stop suspect's cars.

The 33-year-old appeared at the Bristol Crown Court yesterday via video-link from Eastwood Park prison in Gloucestershire and admitted damaging the vehicles. 

Judge Martin Piction told Sheppard she would inevitable be jailed and said he would consider public protection issues when sentencing her next month. He then remanded her in custody. 

Sheppard, who is from Easton, in Bristol, is well known within green activist circles.

In 2009 she was among a group of 18 activists who were found guilty of trying to shut down the Ratcliffe power station in Nottinghamshire. Her conviction and those of her co-accused were later quashed following revelations the group had been infiltrated by undercover police officer Mark Kennedy.

The court heard that Sheppard, of no fixed abode, put the devices outside a police divisional HQ in Emersons Green, Bristol.

Detective Chief Inspector Andy Bevan said the 'stinger' devices rendered the police vehicles 'unusable on what is traditionally one of the busiest nights of the year'.

He said Sheppard placed the devices on the road, 'knowing full well what the consequences could be'.

Police have posted a £10,000 reward for information about known activist Huw 'Badger' Norfolk

Det. Insp. Bevan said: 'They posed a serious risk to our police officers as well as other road users and formed part of a reckless and dangerous plan.'

Sheppard’s conviction is the first by detectives from Avon and Somerset's police's Operation Rhone. A squad was formed in December after police linked more than 100 arson and vandalism attacks on establishment targets that had occurred in and around Bristol and Bath during the last four years. 

The attacks, on police stations, banks and politician's cars, were suspected to have been carried out by anarchists. 

Det. Insp. Bevan said police could not say whether Sheppard was 'linked to other attacks'.

The most costly incident among those being investigated by Operation Rhone officers was an arson at Avon and Somerset’s new firearms centre in August 2013 that caused £16 million in damages.

According to The Guardian, police believe a small group are behind the attacks and have offered a £10,000 reward for information about well-known activist Huw 'Badger' Norfolk. 

Police want to speak to Norfolk about a vandalism attack at the Bristol Post in 2011 and an arson attack on a phone mast in January 2013.  

His whereabouts has been unknown since 2011.
