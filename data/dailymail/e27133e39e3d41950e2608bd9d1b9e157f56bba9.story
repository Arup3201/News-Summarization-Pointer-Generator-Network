A mother who  glued her two-year-old's hands
to a wall wept in court today as she was forced to look at pictures of the little girl's badly beaten body. 

Jocelyn, two, was hit and kicked so brutally that she suffered significant 
brain trauma.

Elizabeth Escalona was being cross-examined by the prosecution at her sentencing in Dallas, Texas.

The mother-of-five told prosecutors that she did not torture her daughter but admitted abusing her.

The prosecution responded by forcing Escalona to look at a graphic photo of the little girl's bruised genitals, which was not visible to the court.

Tortured: Jocelyn, two, fell into a coma after being allegedly beaten and having her hands glued to a wall by her mother

Escalona broke down as she was ordered to count the bruises.

More photos of the little girl's bruised back and buttocks were then shown to the court, according to tweets from court by Dallas Crime.

When asked why she glued the toddler's hands to the wall, the mother said she 'didn't know why'.

She said she didn't remember how long she left the child standing there.

Escalona sat under a screen in the courtroom which at points the prosecution posted the words 'liar' and 'monster'.

The 23-year-old faces
life in prison after pleading guilty in July to felony injury to a child. 
Prosecutors are seeking a 45-year sentence.

When asked by the prosecution what the consequences of her actions should be, Escalona said 'she should be put away...but also given a second chance because she is not a monster'.

Escalona testified that she often 
doesn't tell the truth and that she lied to doctors and other experts 
assigned to her case.

She admitted to drinking and taking drugs while out on bond after her arrest. However she resisted a prosecutor's repeated 
efforts to label her a liar.

I'm not a liar,' Escalona said. 'I have a hard time trusting people.'

The 23-year-old former gang member also admitted in court today that she had smoked marijuana twice a day in the weeks leading up to the alleged attack on Jocelyn. She also said at one point, she was spending $600 a month on the drug.

A day earlier, Escalona pleaded for leniency, saying she would never forgive herself what she did to her daughter.

Escalona
allegedly kicked her daughter, Jocelyn Cedillo, in the stomach, beat 
her with a milk jug, then stuck her hands to an apartment wall using 
Super Glue.

Escalona's other children told authorities their mother attacked Jocelyn because of potty training problems.

Jocelyn suffered bleeding in her brain, a fractured rib, multiple bruises and bite marks and was in a coma for several days.

Some skin had been torn off her hands, where doctors also found glue residue and white paint chips from the apartment wall, witnesses testified.

Prosecutors have portrayed Escalona as 
an unfit mother with a history of violence. They have played recordings 
in which a teenage Escalona threatened to kill her own mother.

They said
she was a former gang member who started smoking marijuana at age 11.

Escalona's five children - including one born since her arrest - are in the care of her mother, Ofelia Escalona.

Attacker: On the day of the attack Escalona, pictured left in her mug shot, changed her Facebook profile photo to one of her and Jocelyn (right) and wrote: 'Why does God put obstacles in my life?'

Escalona previously told a judge: 'I will never forgive myself for what I did to my own daughter. I want everybody to know I'm not a monster. I love my kids.'

A counselor earlier claimed that the woman loves her children. Melanie Davis testified on Wednesday in the case of Escalona.  Davis said she has been counseling the mother since June and believes that she loves all of her children.

She
said that Escalona is determined to find a job and eventually get her 
children, who are living with their grandmother, back to her own home.

The
testimony came as Escalona's sister also pleaded with the judge to be 
lenient in his sentencing, even though she acknowledged her own outrage 
following the grisly attack.

Margaret Escalona said she wanted to beat up her sister after the attack, and described seeing Jocelyn 
struggling for her life. But she says her sister 'needs help' rather than a lengthy sentence.

It also follows testimony on Monday 
from Escalona's mother who said her daughter was 'not a monster' and 
that she deserves probation, insisting her daughter could be 'fixed'.

On Monday, a doctor, Dr
Amy Barton, also revealed the extent of the horrifying injuries to the young girl, who has since recovered.

The girl was rushed to hospital after 
Escalona called her mother and said there was something wrong with her 
daughter. When the child's grandmother got to the house, the girl was 
unresponsive.

Dr
Barton showed photos of the beaten 
child in court showing her bruises, cuts and bite 
marks all over her body shortly after she was brought to Children’s 
Medical Center in Dallas.

Some of her hair had been pulled out and there was glue in her eyelashes and on her hands. Glue and
paint were stuck to her palms, with skin torn away in places, the police report noted.

The toddler was in a coma for two days after the September 7, 2011, incident.

Police
records show the toddler's siblings told investigators their mother 
repeatedly kicked the girl in the stomach, hit her with a milk jug and then beat her with a shoe and belt.

Escalona then dragged her daughter by her feet before gluing her hands to the wall until they bled.

Dr
Barton, a child abuse pediatrician who worked at the hospital at 
the time, cried when she testified about the injuries, according to the Dallas Morning News.

'The entire picture was very shocking,' she said. 'I see a lot of children and this was one of the most shocking things that I've seen.'

The section of the wall the toddler's hands were glued to was cut out and presented to the court.

Escalona, who stayed silent in court, previously said of the case: 'I have no comment, and only God can judge me. That’s all I gotta say.'

Police said that numerous people had seen the suspect inflict pain on her daughter in the past.

On
the day of the attack Escalona changed her Facebook profile photo to 
one of her and Jocelyn and wrote: 'Why does God put obstacles in my 
life?'

The girl has recovered from her injuries. She and her siblings were taken into state custody after their mother’s arrest and now live with their grandmother.
