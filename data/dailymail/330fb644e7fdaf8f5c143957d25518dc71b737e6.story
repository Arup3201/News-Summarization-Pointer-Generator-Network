A self-styled vigilante has been staging citizen's arrests on UberX drivers around Sydney.

Russell Howarth, a limo driver who has been previously affiliated with Uber, says he is fighting back against the ride-sharing app which he labels a 'blatantly illegal operation'.

Customers who use the UberX service get cut-price fairs by taking trips in private cars driven by members of the public.

But Mr Howarth argues that UberX drivers are often unaware that what they are doing is breaking the law under the Passenger Transport Act, and they face fines of up to $110,000 if caught.

Mr Howarth – who is from the UK and spent 10 years in the police force before moving to Sydney to become a limo driver in 2000 – has carried out eight citizen's arrests since October 16.

He said his background, including two years in the advanced riot squad and counter-terrorism, would help him in his quest to 'stop' Uber.

'I know I have the connections, the resolve, and I have the complex methodologies,' he said.

'I have a unique skill set built up over many years in my previous employ and that is to take on these kinds of criminal organisations in ways they haven't anticipated.

'The reason I talk about my background in policing is to say that I know what I'm doing in relation to these arrests - I understand the law.'

The Sydney Morning Herald filmed Mr Howarth conducting one of his arrests during a ride-along with a hidden camera.

In the video, he books an UberX in the Sydney CBD and strikes up a conversation with the driver, who appears to be unaware that operating an UberX is against the law.

After they get out of the car Mr Howarth informs the driver he is placing the man under citizen's arrest.

Police attended the scene but the driver later told the Herald he didn't receive any warning or fine from police and was reassured by Uber than he was not doing anything illegal.

A NSW police spokeswoman said the matter was subject to a police investigation and 'it is not appropriate to comment further'.

Mr Howarth said until earlier this month he had been an Uber Partner for two years, helping to sign drivers and passengers to the app.

'I brought probably like a third of the cars they had on in their first year,' he said.

'In terms of clients easily over 500-1000 passengers.'

But he said he changed his tune because he disagreed with the way Uber operated.

'I realised I couldn't be part of the lie,' he said.

'I would have been rewarded handsomely for it if I convinced more drivers to come on their illegal platform.

'I just thought if I'm not going to be with them I'm actually going to try to stop them.'

Mr Howarth said he has been labelled a 'thug' but asserts he has never used excessive force during his arrests.

'I am clearly not fighting individual drivers – I'm clearly fighting Uber.

'Uber is coercing, manipulating and exploiting these people - not Russell Howarth.

'And if Russell Howarth wasn't out there arresting them every now and then they would still be out there committing these offences.'

A spokeswoman for Uber said Mr Howarth had been 'harassing' a number of drivers and the company had reported him to authorities.

'Russell claims to represent a taxi industry that has not faced any competition in decades and, through its association with Mr Howarth, is now resorting to open intimidation and threats of force to those who dare to provide an alternative service,' she said.

'Hundreds of thousands of riders have taken millions of trips in Australia and we are growing exponentially week on week.

The spokeswoman said Uber has signed up 1100 new drivers  last month, adding that not one of the drivers Mr Howarth has 'harassed' has left Uber.

'With the taxi industry now threatening violence against Uber partners, we call on governments to remove the ambiguity around ridesharing, begin its promised consultation process and provide certainty to the the thousands of Uber partners who are working to provide for themselves and their families,' she said.

The NSW Taxi Council denies any affiliation with Mr Howarth, but is critical of the app and other ride-sharing services.

'The issue here, setting aside his actions, is there is a prevailing sense of injustice among our industry,' said NSW Taxi Council CEO Roy Wakelin-King.

'From the fact that [registered taxi drivers] do right thing, they comply with the law, they have to pay all of their obligations, have cameras in their cars, pay for proper insurance, yet they see people thumbing their nose at the law and operating illegally.'

NSW Transport Minister said Gladys Berejiklian there were serious safety issues to consider.

'This is a complex issue and cities all around the world are grappling with it as we speak,' Ms Berejiklian said in a statement.

Mr Howarth said he has been labelled a 'thug' but asserts he has never used excessive force in his arrests

'Here in NSW we have been very clear that it is illegal for drivers to participate in what we call "ride-sharing" activities like Uber X.

'Roads and Maritime Services has issued several fines of thousands of dollars for those breaking the law and RMS will also be initiating legal action before the end of the year against motorists engaged in driving for Uber X.'

A spokeswoman for NSW Roads and Maritime Services says Uber Pty Ltd does not breach the Passenger Transport Act 1990 by offering the service, but drivers transporting passengers for a fare do.

'Taxi and hire car services in NSW must be provided by an accredited operator authorised by Roads and Maritime,' she said.

'Authorised drivers have relevant criminal history and medical checks. This is to ensure the safety of customers and drivers.'

The spokeswoman added that on the spot fines of between $500 and $1000 have been issued to drivers for offences including 'drive private hire vehicle without authority', but drivers could find themselves facing $110,000 fines before a court.
