Airline staff were forced to tie a drunken passenger to his seat with ropes and wires after he threatened passengers and flight crew on an Air India flight from Melbourne to Delhi.

The passenger on Wednesday's flight reportedly ripped the clothing of two flight attendants and tried to bite several passengers, before the crew were able to tie him to his seat.

The chief pilot had contacted the airline's command centre in Delhi to try to offload him in Singapore, but was told the diversion would have caused long delays across the airline's network.

So the crew had no option but to tie the Indian national to his seat for the duration of the flight.

The man was later handed over to airport security upon arrival in New Delhi. It's not known whether he has been charged.

An Air India worker in Melbourne told Daily Mail Australia they were aware of the incident but had no further details.The airline has been contacted for comment but has not returned calls.

An Air India Pilot told The Times of India: 'Unruly flyers are a safety menace to both fellow flyers and the aircraft itself. Indian carriers have witnessed scores of such acts, either by inebriated passengers, or other perfectly fine people who suddenly acted strange.'

As a result of similar previous incidences, some Indian airlines have demanded to have plastic handcuffs available on board.

Another pilot criticised Indian airlines' leniency towards offering drinks on board their flights.

'Crew of Indian airlines on international flights has to be firm in serving drinks to passengers and ensure that no one gets more than a certain number of drinks,' he told the Times of India.

'Foreign airlines are very strict. Try asking for a third or fourth drink on any western airline and the crew will firmly warn that you will be reported on arrival if you ask for more. Our hospitality, however, makes our crew more lenient which they should not be," said the pilot.
