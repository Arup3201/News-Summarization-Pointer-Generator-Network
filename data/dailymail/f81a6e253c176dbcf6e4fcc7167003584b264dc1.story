Hope: Lindsay Sandiford could escape the firing squad if the agreement is settled

A British grandmother facing the 
firing squad for smuggling drugs into Bali could be sent home if the 
Government agrees to extradite a tycoon wanted over a £900 million 
banking scandal.

Foreign 
Office Minister Baroness Warsi asked Indonesia’s justice minister Amir 
Syamsuddin to allow drugs mule Lindsay Sandiford and a second Briton on 
death row, Gareth Cashmore, to be allowed to serve out jail terms in the
UK.

In return, Mr 
Syamsuddin requested that Britain extradite multi-millionaire Rafat Ali 
Rizvi, a 52-year-old British national sentenced in his absence to 15 
years in 2010 for allegedly stealing funds from Indonesia’s collapsed 
Bank Century.

Mrs Sandiford, 57, was caught carrying cocaine worth £1.6 million in May last year.

Rizvi, 52, who has a luxury home in 
Park Lane, was a major shareholder in Bank Century.

He is accused of 
moving £900 million of distressed debt securities into accounts around the world along with another 
key shareholder.

Rizvi, 
who also has homes in the Bahamas and Singapore, was this year linked to a buyout of Glasgow Rangers FC, despite being on an 
Interpol wanted list.

He claims he is the innocent victim of a political 
conspiracy.

Cashmore, a 34-year-old roofer from Wakefield, West Yorkshire, was convicted last year of smuggling 14lbs of crystal meth.

There is no extradition treaty between Britain and Indonesia, but Mr Syamsuddin Indonesia was willing to discuss ‘co-operation on the transfer of sentenced persons’.

Despair: Mrs Sandiford at her trial earlier this year, when she lost her appeal against a death sentence

Opposed: The Foreign Office said it was against the use of the death penalty

The
Foreign Office said: ‘We do not have a Prisoner Transfer Agreement with
Indonesia but are in discussions about the possibility of introducing 
one.’

The Foreign Office 
insists the cases of the two death row Britons are not being linked to 
the request for the extradition of Rizvi, who has a fortune estimated at
nearly £400 million.

Rizvi's
lawyers claim he could face the death penalty if sent to Indonesia, 
should further corruption charges be levelled against him.

Speaking after his return to Jakarta, Mr Syamsuddin said he had 'conveyed our hope' for the extradition of Rizvi from Britain.

He said he had been told the matter would be raised with the Home Office, which is responsible for the decision.

He
also said a request had been made to him for a special case to be made 
for Sandiford and Cashmore to serve out jail terms in Britain.

A
Foreign Office spokesperson said Baroness Warsi had expressed Britain’s
opposition to the use of the death penalty at the meeting on July 30 
and had appealed for Sandiford and Cashmore to be spared execution.

Asked
if Amir had directly requested for Sandiford and Cashmore to be 
'swapped' for Rizvi, the spokesperson said: 'We cannot comment on the 
Indonesian position.

'The UK position is that the Gareth Cashmore and Lindsay Sandiford cases stand alone.

'We
will continue to take every opportunity to urge the Indonesian 
authorities to reconsider the imposition of the death penalty on both 
these individuals.'

Sandiford has lost her appeal against her death sentence in Bali in April.

A spokesman for Bali High Court announced that the court had rejected an appeal from the 56-year-old from Cheltenham.

Sandiford was caught 
smuggling cocaine in the lining of a suitcase from 
Bangkok to the island last year.

She
got a death sentence despite taking part in a sting after her arrest 
which resulted in the arrest and conviction of the smuggling plot’s 
alleged masterminds, who got lighter sentences.

When
the death sentence was first delivered, the judges said Sandiford had 
damaged the image of Bali as a tourist destination and weakened the 
government's anti-drugs programme.

As
it was read out, there were gasps of surprise in Denpasar District 
Court as not even the prosecution had been seeking the death penalty.

Mule: Sandiford insisted that the drugs found in her suitcase lining were planted

The British grandmother is being kept in Kerobokan jail in Bali, Indonesia. A court official confimed his office had received the appeal request from the prison

In
her witness statement, Sandiford said: 'I would like to begin by 
apologising to the Republic of Indonesia and the Indonesian people for 
my involvement.

'I 
would never have become involved in something like this but the lives of
my children were in danger and I felt I had to protect them.'

During
the trial, her lawyer read out a statement from her son which said: 'I 
love my mother very much and have a very close relationship with her.

'I know that she would do anything to
protect me. I cannot imagine what I would do if she was sentenced to 
death in relation to these charges.'

Briton Julian Ponder, 43, the plot’s 
alleged mastermind, was sentenced to six years for possessing cocaine 
after initial accusations of conspiracy to traffic drugs were reduced.

His
partner Rachel Dougall, 38, got one year for failing to report a crime 
while a third Briton, 40-year-old Paul Beales, jailed for four years for
possessing drugs.

Sandiford
claims she only agreed to carry the cocaine because of death threats to
her son and says Ponder, Beale and Dougall organised her smuggling run 
from Bangkok to Bali.

She
is on death row in the Bali’s notorious Kerobokan jail with Dougall, 
Ponder and Beale and claims to have been subjected to death threats for 
sneaking on them to police.

Dougall,
whose six year-old daughter with Ponder, Kitty, is being cared for by 
her parents in Brighton, is due to walk free in May after completing her
one-year sentence.

The Government has said it is disappointed Sandiford has lost her appeal.

The Foreign Office also reiterated 
the UK's opposition to the death penalty and said it had repeatedly made
representations to the Indonesian government about this case.

A Foreign Office spokesman said: 'We 
are disappointed to hear that Lindsay Sandiford's appeal has been 
refused by the High Court in Bail.

'The UK strongly opposes the death penalty and has repeatedly made representations to the Indonesian government on this matter.

'We will continue to provide consular assistance at this difficult time.'

Jailed: Ponder's partner, 39-year-old Rachel Dougall, was sentenced for her part in the plot, which involved smuggling £1.6million worth of cocaine into Bali

Let-off: Dougall, left, got a one-year sentence for her part in the plot, and Ponder, right, believes his sentence will also be low

The decision follows Foreign Secretary William Hague's earlier plea not to execute the grandmother from Cheltenham.

Mr Hague sent a strongly-worded appeal to the three judges 
through the Foreign Office arguing Sandiford’s death penalty is 
'unwarranted because it is an excessive punishment'.

The
14-page submission, shown to the Mail on Sunday by a court insider, 
says the British government has 'serious concerns' over Sandiford’s 
case.

'The government 
requests that the court takes into account the violations of Mrs 
Sandiford’s fundamental rights and decide that in these circumstances 
the death penalty would not be appropriate,' it says.

Foreign Secretary William Hague has urged Indonesia not to execute drug smuggling grandmother Lindsay Sandiford

'Allegations
of mistreatment of Mrs Sandiford during the initial period in detention
have been raised. This includes threats with a gun and sleep 
deprivation.

'The UK 
government also has serious concerns at the absence of immediate – and 
prolonged delay of – consular notification. This is all the more 
concerning given the absence of legal representation and a translator 
during the period of detention.'

The
document – known as an Amicus Brief  – says Sandiford’s death penalty 
should be reduced to a jail term and implies her execution would have 
diplomatic repercussions.

'Mrs
Sandiford is a 56 year old woman. She has two sons and an infant 
grandchild who would plainly be seriously affected were Mrs Sandiford to
be executed,' it says.

'Mrs Sandiford cooperated with the authorities with a view to detaining others who were involved in the drug trafficking.

'The High Court should take into account this cooperation, especially given that the others involved have now been convicted.'

British
embassy officials in Indonesia did not learn of Sandiford’s arrest for 
nearly two weeks after her initial arrest as she cooperated in the 
drawn-out police sting.

'The
(British) government wishes to draw the attention of the court to the 
allegations of mistreatment by officials when Mrs Sandiford was first 
detained,' says the document.

'This
mistreatment constituted violations of Mrs Sandiford’s fundamental 
rights under international law and Indonesian constitutional law.

'Mrs
Sandiford was also not provided with a lawyer during the period of 
interrogation and in addition concerns have been raised about the 
adequacy of Mrs Sandiford’s legal representation during parts of the 
trial process.' 

Criticising
the January sentence in the district court in the island capital 
Denpasar, document argues: 'It is not apparent that the court took 
account of these considerable mitigating factors when making its 
decision.

'The fact 
that the prosecution did not seek the death penalty gives weight to the 
inappropriateness of the death sentence in Ms Sandiford’s case.'

Human rights organisation Reprieve has previously said it believes there is evidence to show that Sandiford was threatened and coerced into acting as a courier.

Indonesia has an estimated 114 prisoners on death row.

Most of the more than 40 foreigners among them have been convicted of drug crimes, according to a March 2012 report by Australia's Lowy Institute for International Policy.
