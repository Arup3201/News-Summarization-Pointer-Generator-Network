Landon Donovan says he cannot contain his excitement ahead of LA Galaxy's fixture against Manchester United on Thursday.

The 32-year-old is chomping at the bit to perform against Louis van Gaal's side - in what will be the Dutchman's first pre-season game in charge of the club.

United take part in the Chevrolet Cup against their MLS counterparts in California's Rose Bowl stadium before heading to Denver, Washington DC and Detroit during their pre-season tour against Roma, Inter Milan and Real.

Donovan, who was a contentiously omitted from Jurgen Klinsmann's USA World Cup squad, is relishing the occasion to play in front of a huge crowd against stellar opposition.

'It is exciting', he said ahead of the game. 'I think for our guys we don't often get the chance to play against a team like this, we don't get to play in front of 60,000-70,000 people all the time so it will be exciting.'

'As everybody knows nowadays you don't get friendly matches anymore and obviously with a new manager and some new players for them they're going to be ready to go and we'll do the same.'
