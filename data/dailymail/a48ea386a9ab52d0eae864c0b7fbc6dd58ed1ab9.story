A brother died in a car crash yesterday as he rushed to hospital upon hearing his sister had fatally shot herself - less than six months after he killed his stepfather in a gunfight.

Ricky Tucker, 20, was speeding to St. John Hospital, in Detroit, to be by his sister Brenda's bedside after she shot herself during a bout of depression at around 2am on Sunday.

But his car veered out of its lane and collided with an oncoming Chevrolet Suburban killing him and leaving the driver of the SUV with minor injuries, police said.

Thirty minutes earlier, Miss Tucker, 21, had threatened suicide inside the Texas Bar on Kercheval, - owned by her family - before pointing the gun at her chest and pulling the trigger.

'She grabbed a gun, and I took it away from her head,' her uncle, Eddie Falbo told the Detroit News.

'Others were talking to her. I came out the door and heard, "pop". It was terrible. There were about eight to ten people in the bar; everyone heard it.'

Ricky Tucker, who was in the bar at the time then drove to the hospital to check on her, police said, unaware that she was already dead.

Double loss: Relatives are now trying to raise money for the funeral costs

'He probably didnâ€™t know she had died and he was rushing to the hospital to see how she was doing,' police spokesman Kelly Miner said.

'He left the center (lane) and struck an SUV and, when they took him to the hospital, he died on arrival.'

Relatives have set up a memorial page and are trying to raise money for funeral costs.

The incident marked the third death in the family during the past six months, Mr Falbo said, adding that Ricky Tucker fatally shot his step-father in self-defense.

'The boy - the one who just died - killed his step-dad; they were shooting back and forth, and he killed him in self-defense,' Mr Falbo told the News. 'The police let him right out of jail, because (his step-father) was shooting at him.

'Three people in one family killed in six months,' he added. 'These kids' mother is going through hell.'
