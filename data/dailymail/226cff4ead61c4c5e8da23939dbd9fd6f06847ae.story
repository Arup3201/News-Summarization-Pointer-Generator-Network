Ah, the joys of taking an early morning bath...

At first you might be a bit timid, specially on chilly days such as these.

But soon you’re splashing about in the water, getting thoroughly soaked and with a big smile on your beak.

Taking a dip: A Blue tit has a bath in Corwen, North Wales, yesterday morning

Splish: Water flies up as the little blue tit takes to the pool

And maybe your thoughts turn to what you’ll be having for breakfast – perhaps a nice tasty worm?

But then, disaster. As you sit there in all your soaking finery, you realise you’ve forgotten to put out a towel...

Not a problem, of course, for this blue tit pictured by wildlife photographer Richard Bowler in a pool in the grounds of his rural home in Corwen, North Wales.

The little fellow just had to flit about a bit in the winter sunshine and bingo, he was nice and dry again.

Splash: He makes sure that he gives himself a good soaking

Splosh: ...and dunks his head to do the hard to reach bits

It is likely that the bird would have been having a brief break from searching for something to eat in Mr Bowler's garden.

The birds are particularly common in woodland, hedgerows and parks across the UK all year round.

The RSPB estimates that there are around 15 million blue tits in the UK between October and March.

In all there are up to 44 million blue tits in Europe.
