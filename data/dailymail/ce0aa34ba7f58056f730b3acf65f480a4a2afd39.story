Dangerous or just creative? Authorities in a Maryland school district suspended English teacher Patrick McLaw and some claim it was over fear he'd turn his sci-fi novels about school shootings into reality

A Maryland English teacher is on academic probation after authorities became concerned that he might act out his sci-fi novels about mass shootings.

If the novels first tipped authorities off last month about Patrick Wayne McLaw, his 'several aliases' and the model school building he kept in his Wicomico County home got them seriously worried.

But the 23-year-old first-year teacher was never arrested, leading some to suggest his treatment is little more than a witch hunt.

However, authorities said Tuesday that it's McLaw's mental wellbeing and not threats of violence that had them worried.

So why did authorities search the school where McLaw taught eighth grade language arts for bombs before students returned for class last week?

'[We] agreed that the prudent thing to do was search for any type of weapons or implements or devices that could be damaging to children,' Sheriff James W. Phillips Jr. told the Baltimore Sun on Tuesday.

That decision came after the area school board was told about a man named Dr. K.S. Voltaer, who'd written the novels The Insurrectionist and a sequel called Lillith's Heir.

That man also once went by Patrick Beale, whose name was legally changed to Patrick McLaw.

Authorities also searched McLaw's home, where he lived with his mother, and they discovered the model school building.

The K-9 bomb-sniffing units sent into Mace's Lane Middle School suggest authorities feared McLaw would act out some grim fantasy.

However, State's Attorney Matthew A. Maciarello now claims authorities acted out solely out of fear for the teacher's mental health.

Evidence? McLaw wrote a book set in the year 2900, as well as a sequel, about a gruesome school shooting under the pen name Dr. K.S. Voltaer

According to the Sun, officials revealed after the search that McLaw had written a letter with 'suicidal undertones' to school higher-ups.

McLaw was never arrested. Instead, he was taken in for a psychological evaluation. However, authorities chose not to share all of the details of the case until this week.

The tight-lipped authorities gave free speech proponents room to launch a campaign demanding McLaw be reinstated.

'This superstitious demonizing of literature strikes at the heart of our most fundamental liberties,' reads a Change.org petition, which boasts nearly 2,000 posted in support of McLaw.

Miciarello has now denied the books had anything to do with the actions of his office.

'It didn't start with the books and it didn't end with the books,' he told the LA Times. 'It's not even a factor in what law enforcement is doing now.'

An attorney for McLaw, David Moore, told The LA Times that his client 'is receiving treatment.'

Police were concerned enough over a letter McLaw wrote to sweep the middle school where he taught for bombs. However, the State's Attorney later said they feared only for McLaw's mental health and that the letter had 'suicidal undertones'
