The head of art at a prestigious grammar school who began a lesbian affair with a teenage pupil has been banned from teaching for life.

Debbie Evans, 55, who taught at South Wilts Grammar School in Salisbury for 23 years, struck up a sexual relationship with the girl in 2011, after the teenager fell ill at school and she supported her.

The National College of Teaching and Leadership (NCTL) disciplinary panel was told that Evans began teaching at the school in 1990, had a previously unblemished career as Head of Art and was a respected member of the team.

But after the girl joined the school in 2010 a sexual relationship developed between them, and continued after the pupil - who was over 16 -  left the school.

The panel was told that in May 2011, the girl - referred to as Student A  - was taken ill at the school and was helped by Ms Evans.

Then, that summer, the teacher was invited to a meal at Student A's home and began to give her lifts to and from school.

In late 2011 Student A turned 18, and the following month she and Ms Evans went for a meal where it was alleged that they kissed, marking the start of their sexual relationship.

The girl finished sixth form in July 2012, but it was claimed that the relationship continued until October 2013.

The student's mother contacted the school on October 27, 2013, to discuss unspecified concerns about a teacher. On October 31 2013, Ms Evans resigned with effect from 31 December 2013.

But meanwhile, on November 11 2013, Student A's parents reported the alleged relationship to senior staff. 

The disciplinary panel findings say Evans admitted that she had 'abused her position of trust by entering into an inappropriate relationship, including of a sexual nature' with the girl.

The findings add that her conduct fell 'significantly short of the standards expected of the profession.'

Imposing the ban on behalf of the Education Secretary, NCTL official, Paul Heathcote, said Evans had been found to have 'abused her position of trust,' that her actions were 'sexually motivated' and had caused the girl emotional harm.

He said the disciplinary panel considered she was guilty of 'serious sexual misconduct.'

He continued : 'Ms Evans has shown insight into her actions and is remorseful. She has co-operated with this process and the panel have judged that she does not pose a continuing threat to pupils.

'However, having paid due regard to the maintenance of public confidence in the profession and the declaring and upholding of proper standards of conduct, the panel have recommended that the order should be without the opportunity for an application to have it set aside. I agree with this recommendation.'

The ban stipulates that she will not be allowed to apply to have the ban set aside.

She can, however, appeal against the ban to the High Court.
