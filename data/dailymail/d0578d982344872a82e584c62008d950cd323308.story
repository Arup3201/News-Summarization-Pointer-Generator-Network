The 'disgraceful' reaction from Chelsea players forced referee Bjorn Kuipers to send off Paris Saint-Germain striker Zlatan Ibrahimovic during the ill-tempered Champions League tie at Stamford Bridge, said Sportsmail's Jamie Carragher.

Carragher's fellow Sky Sports pundit Graeme Souness went further, branding Jose Mourinho's players 'pathetic', but co-commentator Gary Neville  defended the Blues for being 'shrewd'.

Ibrahimovic was sent off after a lunging challenge on Chelsea's Oscar on the half hour mark but it appeared harsh as both players made forceful tackles.

The 33-year-old seemed apologetic as soon as he realised the impact of his challenge before the Chelsea players swarmed the referee demanding action. 

'It was very unfortunate, it’s not a red card. I actually think he’s trying to pull his foot away. You look at it and you think Oscar’s foot is as high, if not higher,' Carragher said on Sky Sports.

‘If the referee is the other side then the referee might look at Oscar and give the decision the other way.'

Carragher insisted the actions from the Chelsea players were the deciding factor in the dismissal.

'The reaction from the Chelsea players is disgraceful. It’s something that is sad that is coming into the game. It comes from I think Jose Mourinho’s teams, they have this reaction, it’s not a one off,' added Carragher.

Souness branded the actions of Chelsea's squad 'pathetic'.

He said: 'In Jamie’s (Carragher) generation, when someone caught you, the last thing you wanted to show your opponent is that you’re injured, today it’s the exact opposite. If someone brushes you, you want to go down and get them in trouble. That’s how pathetic it is.

'Thank goodness PSG stood up to that and leave here with great credit. They are the proper team.' 

Former Manchester United captain Neville disagreed with his colleagues.

He said: ‘Listening to the lads at half-time, I’m not as damning about Chelsea reacting because partly times it happened during my career when you tried to influence the referee. But for far too many times you’ve seen naive English teams in Europe, that have been done on occasions like that.

The PSG forward immediately acknowledged his fault in the incident having collided with Oscar

‘Here, we’ve got a team that is shrewd. People at home might not like it but if the boot was on the other foot we’d be calling PSG shrewd. They play the game, that’s what you need to do in European competition over the last 20, 30 years. It’s different trying to gain those advantages.

‘I like the idea that it’s an English team that is shrewd and not the opposition. It comes from Mourinho, he knows how to play the game.’

However, Neville did acknowledge it was a harsh decision on Ibrahimovic:  'It's not a red card for me, I think that's a poor decision from the referee. He must have got his red card out within two or three seconds.'

At half-time, Carragher had also suggested that such intimidation comes from their manager Mourinho: 'I always think with Mourinho’s teams that they will always be respected but they’ll never be loved because of situations like this. 

'They take winning to another level that no other team or manager does that I’ve seen over the years.'

'We all want to win but the reaction of the Chelsea players has definitely played a part and Jose Mourinho’s words in the press conference have worked.' 

Mourinho, in his post-match interview after his side were beaten on away goals, bemoaned PSG’s apparent time wasting but Carragher dismissed such claims as hypocrisy. 

‘Mourinho is the master of time wasting and he did that from the first two minutes at Anfield last year (when Chelsea all but ended Liverpool’s title hopes),' he said.

'I’m not criticising him, I applauded him at the time and I know it’s part of the game, but he can’t complain about PSG and that English football is clean as the only dirty tricks we saw were from Chelsea by surrounding the referee and the reaction was disgraceful.’

Carragher also questioned the quality of the Premier League after Chelsea crashed out: 'As a football person you want to see the best teams go through, we want the English teams to do well, to go through and represent our country,' he said at full-time.

'You think of the TV deal, the money we’ve got, we’re getting kidded. You see some of the players PSG have got. Now they’ve paid big money as well but you look at Arsenal, Man City. We’re supposed to be the biggest league in the world, with the best players. We are miles away.'

Sky Sports pundit Graeme Souness branded the Chelsea players 'pathetic' for their antics on Wednesday

In the Sky studio at full-time Souness was keen to highlight Chelsea's behaviour was 'unacceptable' and was full of praise for the Parisians:

'It hurts me to say this but Chelsea earlier with their shenanigans early on, with the manager coming out with his talk that this is the most aggressive team we’ve ever played. Saying they are over physical, Mourinho is having a laugh,' Souness told Sky Sports.

'This is a team that is full of technique, a really good footballing team. They had to put up with a lot of stuff I find really unappealing.

'That is from other players, the minute they come out of the tunnel, the first minute of the game, they are looking to get the opposition in trouble, get them booked, see if they can get them sent off. The reaction from the Chelsea players on the challenge on Oscar opitimises what I’m saying,' added Souness.

'To a man they were surrounding the referee, even Costa ran 50 yards to get involved. Oscar originally wasn’t going to get involved and then you can see in the pictures that as soon as his team-mates all raising their arms around the referee, then he gets involved.

'That’s something we can deal without, It’s not the British way of doing things and it is creeping into our game which I find it totally unacceptable.'
