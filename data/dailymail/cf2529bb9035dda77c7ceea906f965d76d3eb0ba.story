The eight-year-old boy who touched hearts around the world with his heartbreaking battle with brain cancer has sadly died.

School boy Sam Martin, who was diagnosed with an aggressive and inoperable brain tumour in July 2013, died peacefully at his home on the Sunshine Coast, in Queensland, on Wednesday night.

His devastated father Mark Martin confirmed the news in a brave tribute post on a Facebook page that has thousands of followers and was set up to support Sam.

'Sam simply drifted off to sleep without any further pain, anguish or suffering which is a blessing given what the little guy has been through the last 14 months,' Mr Martin wrote on Thursday.

Eight-year-old Sam Martin lost his battle with brain cancer on October 8 2014

Last month, Sam's family confirmed that he was expected to pass away at any day after the stage three adult-type fibrosarcoma he was suffering from had not been cured by 13 rounds of chemotherapy and seven weeks of radiation therapy.

A heart-wrenching video showed his declining journey from a glowing, energetic and healthy young boy to a very frail, sick child and pulled at the heart strings of complete strangers who expressed their warm wishes on the Facebook page dedicated to the lovable boy.

Sam's father described his 'mixed feelings' over his son's death in his post on the  page Sam's Journey. He said he was feeling 'immense sadness and extreme pride.'

'Immense sadness in that Sam passed away peacefully at 19.47 last night at home with Tanya, Ella, Roxy and I by his side,' he explained.

In a tribute to Sam, his father Mark said he was feeling 'mixed emotions' 

But he added he felt 'extreme pride in Sam, for enduring what he has with little to no complaint, for his ability in bringing together a community in such a positive manner, for being the greatest son a parent could wish for, for being that spark that ignited all those around him, for being just SAM.'

The father praised Sam's older sister, Ella, calling her 'the unsung hero of this whole deal'.

'In her own special way she has been the glue that has kept us all together, her ability to lift both Tanya and I when we've had our moments has been priceless. 

'While Sam has attracted a fair amount of our space and time over the past year and a bit the world better look out for this one, she has a fire, a strength and a determination that is scary,' Mr Martin wrote.

Sam's dad, Mark Martin, said his son has always had a truly magnetic personality and a certain 'like ability'

He also wrote a touching tribute to his wife Tanya, Sam's mother. 

'To this day her strength and beauty blows me away and I could not have asked for a better partner to have walked the path we have so far. While the path ahead is daunting and unknown together I know we will be fine.'

He added: 'While Sam is no longer physically here rest assured this won't be the last you hear of our special little man.' 

Doctors sent Sam home to be with his family in September as they were unable to operate on the tumour which had moved into the brain.

Brain cancer kills more children than any other type of cancer, yet nine out of 10 Australians are completely unaware of this statistic

His parents Mark and Tanya Martin and big sister Ella, 10, have been overwhelmed by the support shown from strangers from all over the world including the Netherlands, Malaysia, Canada, London and Denmark.

Mr Martin said it was hard to find the words to describe the love shown for his son.

'Ever since Sam was born he has had a certain 'like ability' to him, one of those truly magnetic personalities,' he told the Sunshine Coast Daily.

'It is heartening to see even through all this he has maintained that quality, as is evident by the outpouring of love from everyone.'

Sam was very fatigued from the medication to keep his pain at bay before he died

One of more than 5,000 people who have joined the Sam's Journey Facebook page, is Melinda Casaubon who although she doesn't know Sam or his family, held a group walk up Mount Coolum in his honour.

'I have a son the same age so I just can't imagine what they are going through,' Ms Casaubon told Daily Mail Australia. 

'I thought it would be nice to get outdoors and do something local where we can enlighten Sam and his family's day and also think about the things we take for granted.'

The 52 lives website also has a page dedicated to Sam asking people to light a candle and post the photo on his Facebook page or email it through the site. 

Before he died Sam was almost uncommunicative and very fatigued from the medication to keep his pain at bay.

'It's really sad to see. It rips me apart because there is no interaction because he is on that many drugs to manage his pain,' Mr Martin said.

In August, Australian neurosurgeon Charlie Teo told Daily Mail Australia brain cancer kills more children than any other type of cancer, yet nine out of 10 Australians are completely unaware of this statistic.

And the figures speak for themselves. Only three per cent of funding from the National Health and Medical Research Council has gone towards brain cancer.

From 2009 to 2013, brain cancer research received just under $28 million. Over the same period, breast cancer took 11 per cent of the Government funding pool, or $100 million.

Leukaemia research received just a touch less at $96 million over the four years.

Dr Teo said Australia is guilty of leaving children to fight brain cancer battle alone.

'That's pretty dismal [the funding levels] considering just two in ten patients will survive for five years in Australia,' he told Daily Mail Australia.

Brain cancer has more impact on society than any other cancer but it receives least amount of funding.'

When asked about why there's low awareness surrounding the disease, Dr Teo had a simple answer.

'It's because everyone dies,' he said.

'There are no survivors who can tell their story and become ambassadors for the cause - not even from my high profile clients. They're all dead.'

For the average Australian family who've been affected by the tragedy, they often don't want to relive the devastating moments.

'It's an especially terrible death for children who lose function, become paralysed and suffer horribly from the debilitating death,' Dr Teo said.

Sam's family hope to raise awareness of childhood brain cancer and the impact it can have.
