A 13-year-old boy on a dream vacation with his family at a Disney World hotel has died after drowning in the pool.

Anthony Johnson, of Springfield, Missouri, was on holiday with his father and step-mother at Disney's Pop Century Resort, which is in the grounds of the Orlando theme park.

He was swimming in the hotel pool with a group of children including his little brother, Christopher, and a cousin around 9.30pm when the incident occurred.

His father Kenneth and a fellow vacationer tried to save his life performing CPR at the poolside but he died at Florida Hospital Celebration Health this morning.

There are no lifeguards on duty at the pool beyond 8pm but it remains open for use.

A local broadcaster filmed children playing in the same pool tonight and said there are signs warning that pool users are unattended.

Anthony's family back in Missouri paid tribute to him today as a much-loved boy with a passion for dirt-bikes and rap music.

His mother Jessica Gilbreath thanked well-wishers on Facebook.

It is understood that she flew to Orlando to be by his bedside last night.

Much-loved: Several family members paid tribute to Anthony last night who was a keen skateboarder and loved rap music.

'He touched a lot of people, he is loved by so many. And that makes us all family, thank you for loving him,' she wrote.

It is believed Anthony was on holiday with his father and step-mother Chelsy Garcia and their three younger children when the incident occurred.

A firefighter on vacation, William Cybulski, rushed to the family's aid at the resort when he heard the commotion and saw the unconscious child being pulled from the water.

He performed CPR until the emergency services arrived.

He told WKMG 6: 'You never want to see something like that on vacation or to any child in general no matter where you are.'

His girlfriend Crystal Loschiavo told the channel that she helped get other upset children out of the pool, which is around 4ft deep, as her partner desperately tried to rescue the teen.

'I heard someone say, 'Call help, call help',' she said. 'The little brother was really upset he kept saying, 'This is my only brother, this is my only brother, I don't want anything to happen to him.'

The Orange County Sheriff's Office confirmed Anthony had died this morning.

A statement from Disney said: 'We are saddened by Anthony Johnson’s passing and our hearts go out to his family, friends and loved ones. We have reached out to his family to offer care and assistance during this difficult time.'

The Pop Century Resort hotel is one of several Disney owned hotels located in the grounds of the theme park.

It is made up of kid-friendly, brightly-colored buildings decorated with giant toys.
