Manchester City defender Bacary Sagna is ready to play at centre back for the Blues if required.

City lost a key man in the position when captain Vincent Kompany was forced off in Saturday's 1-0 Barclays Premier League win at Leicester due to a recurrence of a hamstring problem.

Manager Manuel Pellegrini said after the contest that Kompany could be out of action until the new year.

And Sagna, the former Arsenal full back who signed for City over the summer, said of the prospect of filling in for the skipper in the middle: 'I have played a few times at centre-back for Arsenal.

'If I have to play I will play, and always try to give 100 per cent and my best for the team.

'But hopefully he (Kompany) will be ready for (Saturday's home league clash with) Crystal Palace.'

The 31-year-old France international, quoted by the Manchester Evening News, added: 'I could cope but we have other players as well who can play.

'(Dedryck) Boyata did well against Sunderland (a 4-1 away league win on December 3). But if I have to play in any position then I will play.'
