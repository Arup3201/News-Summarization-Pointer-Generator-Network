Louisiana GOP Rep. Vance McAllister won't seek re-election this fall after being caught on video kissing a married female aide.

He will, however, serve out the remainder of his term, which concludes the first week of January 2015.

The recently elected Congressman said he would not resign because he did not want the people of his district to be left with a vacant seat again.

Republican Rep. Vance McAllister, right,  who got caught on a security tape cheating on his wife Kelly, left, said Monday that he will not resign. He not seek re-election this fall, however

'The past few weeks have been a trying time for my family,' McAllister said in a statement, according to POLITICO. 'As
 I've said before, there's no doubt I've made a mistake. I've failed 
those I care most about and let down the people who elected me to 
represent them.'

McAllister was elected fewer than six months ago after then-Rep.Rodney Alexander left Congress unexpectedly to take a job with Louisiana Governor Bobby Jindal.

A businessman with no political experience, McAllister won a special election in November 2013 to represent the districts, surprising the GOP by handily defeating the Republican establishment candidate.

He put his family and his faith at the center of his campaign for Congress, appearing with his wife and their children in one commercial and vowing to 'defend our Christian way of life' if elected.

To win the seat, McAllister largely self-financed his election bid and got a boost from endorsements by his most famous constituents, the bearded Robertson men of the cable television hit Duck Dynasty.

The first-term Congressman's fledgling political career came came to an abrupt halt earlier this month a north Louisiana newspaper released a grainy security tape showing McAllister 
kissing Melissa Peacock, an aide and family friend, in the congressman's
 district headquarters.

McAllister
 apologized and Peacock resigned, along with the congressman's district 
director who was suspected of releasing the video. But top Republican 
officials in the state, including Jindal, called on the congressman to 
step down.

Disgraced Christian lawmaker Vance McAllister was caught on video in a steamy clinch with a female staffer. The video showed McAllister, a married father-of-five, kissing married staffer Melissa Peacock inside his darkened office

Peacock, 33, has since 'voluntarily resigned' from her position

The Louisiana Congressman has 
stayed out of public sight since the scandal erupted, canceling events 
for therapy sessions and saying he was spending time with his family 
during Congress' Easter recess.

Before boarding a plane for 
Washington with his wife Kelly on Monday, McAllister told The News-Star he was 'committed to serving the 5th District to the best of my ability through
 this term, but I also have to take care of my family as we work 
together to repair and strengthen the relationship I damaged.'

'Our family is together and better and stronger than we were before,' he said.

McAllister's wife told the news publication that she was committed to her relationship with her husband.

'I'm behind him 100 percent.'

Top Republicans in the state, who had called McAllister's behavior embarrassing and hypocritical, welcomed McAllister's resignation.

'While
 we still believe the best course of action would have been for 
Congressman McAllister to resign so he can focus on his family, we are 
pleased Congressman McAllister and constituents in the district can 
begin the process of putting this unfortunate situation behind them,' 
GOP Gov. Bobby Jindal said in a statement.

Likewise,
 state Republican Party Chairman Roger Villere said that while he would 
have liked to see McAllister 'close this chapter sooner, I was happy to 
hear of his decision to do what is best for his family and his 
constituents.'

A spokeswoman for former Rep. Alexander, whose resignation forced the 2013 special election, said Monday he will not seek election to his old seat.

State Rep. Robert Johnson, a Democrat who unsuccessfully ran for the seat against McAllister last year, continued to call for the congressman to resign on Monday, saying he has been neglecting his office's responsibilities during the scandal.

'He's not doing his job. He isn't communicating with other elected officials. He isn't communicating with his constituents. For all practical purposes, the people of our district are without representation in the United States Congress,' Johnson said in a statement.
