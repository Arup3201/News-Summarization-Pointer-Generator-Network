The relatives of a woman who died mysteriously have aired their suspicions about her husband as they believe that he had something to do with her death.

Dr Michael Wohlschlaeger's fifth wife Shirley Seitz died in their Alabama bedroom following days of unexplained pain and now her relatives are still waiting for justice.

He has never been charged with any crimes in connection to her death and maintains that he is innocent, but her relatives painted a far more sinister picture of the four-year marriage that ended with Seitz unconscious, face down on their bedroom floor.

Her relatives told 20/20
that since Seitz's death in 2010, her relatives have discovered that 
'he soaked her dry' both before and after she died- cashing in on a 
$100,000 life insurrance policy and having her use her $500,000 in 
liquid assets that she had going into the marriage to buy their home and
bankroll their life together.

Marriage number five: Shirley Seitz and Michael Wohlschlaeger met each other just three months before they got married in 2006, and the union was the fifth marriage for both. Four years later, she was dead.

Seitz's daughter Sharon Yeomans said 
that they were wary of Wohlschlaeger's financial footing even before her
mother decided to marry him.

Murky career: In the early 1990s, Dr Wohlschlaeger was found guilty of arson when he set his chiropractor's office on fire

'He came into the marriage with the clothes on his back. And he's a doctor?' Mrs Yeomans told ABC.

Her relatives were hesitant when Seitz rushed into her marriage with Wohlschlaeger in 2006 after just a three month courtship.

Adding to that, she had her own share of relationship issues in the past, as this was also her fifth marriage.

Her fourth husband Gene Seitz had left her $1million following his death, and while she never told her relatives that she felt used during her four year marriage to Wohlschlaeger, they found out after her death.

When Mrs Yeomans was looking for answers- searching her mother's house in Loxley, Alabama for her original will- she stumbled upon her mother's personal journals.

'How much longer am I going to have to financially support this man? He said he wasn't going to do this to me. He said he was going to get a job. He's constantly spending my money. Lord when is he going to get a job?' Seitz wrote in one entry, according to her daughter.

The 20/20 investigation proved that his apparent money problems started much earlier, before his marriage to Seitz.

A former police officer told ABC that in the early 1990s, he saw smoke coming from Wohlschlaeger's medical office in Chipley, Florida.

Rather than calling police to report an 
alleged crime- as he claimed that someone attacked him inside his office
and set the place on fire during the altercation- the officer saw 
Wohlschlaeger just standing across the street watching the fire.

Caring: Seitz, who had inherited $1million when her fourth husband died, was an evangelist and a 'giver'

The women that came before: His first wife (Lynn) died from choking on a cough drop, his second (Paula) got a divorce after three years; Gloria said he hit her with a mallet while she was sleeping. His fourth (Diana) said she thought he was poisoning her

Wohlschlaeger also smelled of diesel fuel, which was later discovered to be the cause of the fire.

Wohlschlaeger was charged with arson and put on 15 years probation, in addition to having his license revoked. After the guilty verdict was handed down, he allegedly threatened the officer.

Now, two of his other ex wives say that he also showed violent behavior during their marriages- facts that they did not disclose during the investigation into Seitz's death.

His third wife, Gloria Potts, was married to him from 1981 to 1995. When contacted by Seitz's daughter, she said that he once hit her with a mallet in the back of her head and then tried to smother her in their bed.

Potts said that she was hospitalized after the incident and told doctors that she fell in the shower.

Scary: Wohlschlaeger's third wife Gloria Potts told ABC that even though he attacked her in her sleep one night- which he said was a side effect of being stung by jellyfish in China- she stayed married to him for another decade before getting divorced

Different stories: Wohlschlaeger had previously told Seitz's family that he was holding his first wife Lynn's (pictured) hand when she died of leukemia. They later found out she died from choking on a throat losange

When she later asked what he was doing, Potts said that he gave an unbelievable reason: ‘He told me he had gotten stung by jellyfish when he was in China and that it was a reaction to the toxins.’

She did not leave him until a decade later- a move that she cannot rationally explain now, but when she did finally divorce him, she told police about the mallet incident and now has a restraining order against him.

Wohlschlaeger's fourth wife, Diana Yohn, was the woman he divorced just months before marrying Seitz.

She told police that while she did not have firm proof, she felt that her regular migranes got significantly worse during her marriage to Wohlschlaeger and she felt he played a role in her pain.

'I think that the man's dangerous, personally,' she told police.

'I get migraine headaches, okay? And it's documented that I do. But they were so bad when I lived with him, I, I couldn't even work, I could hardly function.

'And I'll be honest with you...if something happens to me, he needs to be investigated.'

Mrs Yohn's complaint resonated even more strongly with Seitz's relatives because they were the same symptoms she complained of before her death.

During the investigation, Wohlschlaeger told police that in the days leading up to her death, Seitz had been feeling ill and having one of her bi-annual bouts of migranes.

Odd symptoms: In the days leading up to her death, Shirley Seitz had been suffering from severe migraines. Her autopsy reported she had multiple blunt force head injuries

Suspicions: Shirley's daughter Sharon Yeoman suspects that Wohlschlaeger killed her mother- and that he was having an affair with his current (sixth) wife at the time of Seitz's death

Her mother and brother made a surprise visit to the home that Seitz and Wohlschlaeger shared in Loxley to check in on her.

They said that she felt so ill that she could not even get out of bed to greet them.

When they arrived, Wohlschlaeger said that he had been out of town but when he got back he saw that a potted plant had been broken and he believed Seitz had possibly fallen down the stairs. She denied falling down the stairs.

Seitz’s symptoms had improved by the time she said goodnight to her relatives on Sunday February 28, 2010. The next morning, they awoke to Wohlschlaeger screaming that his wife was unconscious.

Wohlschlaeger had been sleeping on the couch, and on that Monday morning he said he went into the bedroom and found his wife lying on the floor, unconscious, and her lips were already blue when he saw her.

This was not his first wife who died under unusual circumstances either. Throughout his marriage to Seitz, he had told her and her relatives that his first wife, Lynn, died of leukemia. He added that he was holding her hand when she succumbed to the cancer.

Out and about: Wohlschlaeger now lives with his sixth wife Maggie in Pensacola, Florida and has never been charged in connection to Seitz's death, but the case has now been reopened

Following her mother’s death, Mrs Yeoman found an old newspaper clipping that reported that Lynn Mary Wohlschlaeger died after choking on a cough drop at the age of 25.

The cause of death for Seitz was not as clear, however, as an autopsy listed the cause of death was inconclusive but that she had a series of blunt force head injuries.

‘Man, I hate to say this, but I think someone murdered my sister,’ Seitz’s brother Chester told 20/20.

The Alabama Attorney General has now reopened the investigation into Seitz’s death, though the former chiropractor no longer lives in the state.

Wohlschlaeger now lives in Pensacola, Florida with his sixth wife, Maggie- the woman who Mrs Yeoman now believes Wohlschlaeger was having an affair with at the end of his marriage to her mother. 

‘There’s no question in my mind that Michael killed this woman,’ his third wife Gloria Potts told ABC.

‘Michael killed Shirley.’
