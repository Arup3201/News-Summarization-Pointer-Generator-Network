Its $310 tasting menu makes Per Se one of New York City's most expensive restaurants, but its C grade from health inspectors puts it near the bottom of the heap when it comes to sanitary violations.

Three Michelin-starred Per Se got 42 violation points when it was inspected February 19, city health department records showed. Infractions included failure to hold hot food at 140 degrees and a lack of a hand-washing facility near the food preparation area.

Per Se representatives did not immediately return a call seeking comment about the lowest possible grade, but the restaurant will have a chance to argue its case at a hearing. Until then it must post a sign saying its grade is pending.

The violations also also included failure to hold cold food below 41 degrees, eating or drinking in the food-prep area and tobacco use, according to the New York Post.

City records indicate that Per Se has received more than 40 violations in the past.

The 10-year-old Per Se is the East Coast outlet of Thomas Keller's French Laundry in Yountville, California.

Per Se is one of only seven New York City restaurants to earn three Michelin stars, and The New York Times called it the city's best restaurant in 2011.

Far to fall: C is the lowest possible grade a restaurant can receive in the system first implemented by Mayor Bloomberg in 2010. Until now, the restaurant--where the prix fixe meal costs $620--had only ever received A's

The chef's tasting menu for Sunday included Hudson Valley duck foie gras and Nova Scotia lobster a la Bordelaise. There was a $100 surcharge for Wagyu beef.

New York City health officials began issuing letter grades to restaurants in 2011, and about 87 percent of city restaurants have "A'' grades, a Health Department spokesman said.

Late last year, Mayor Bloomberg called for a boycott all 4,500 restaurants with a B, C, or Grade Pending rating in an effort to force the eateries to shape up or get out.

In 2012, the Post reported that the vaunted eatery avoided having to post the B grade it received with a 'well-placed call' to the Health Department.

The city reportedly 'accepted Per Seâ€™s explanation' at the time that the inspector was in error with his grading and they were given in A.
