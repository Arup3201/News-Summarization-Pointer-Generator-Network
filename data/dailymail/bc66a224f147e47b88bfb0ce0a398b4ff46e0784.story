A passenger jet flying from London to Dubai has been forced to divert to Munich this morning after a 'medical emergency' on board.

Emirates flight EK8, which departed from Heathrow Airport this morning, was due to arrive in the United Arab Emirates at 8pm local time - but was instructed instead to land in the German city.

Data from the flight monitoring website flightradar24 appeared to show that the aircraft changed course over Germany.
