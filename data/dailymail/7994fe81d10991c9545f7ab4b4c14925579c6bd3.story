A town mayor became so fed up with residents' bad manners he has introduced new rules forcing them to be polite.

Mayor Gerard Plée brought in regulations requiring all visitors to speak politely to staff at the town hall in Lhéraule, situated a little north of Paris.

And if anyone forgets their Ps and Qs or fails to say 'thank you' they will promptly be told to leave.

Mind your Ps and Qs: Visitors to the Lheraule town hall can now be forced to leave if they are rude after the mayor brought in new rules demanding politeness

Mayor Plee said: 'Being polite is the basic gesture of respect towards others which is needed for people to live together in harmony.

'I believe that when people enter the town hall they should comply with certain common courtesies, such as wishing people good morning, saying goodbye when they leave, and please and thank you when they are being served.

'If I don’t introduce this rule I have no power to take action against these people because there is no law in France that forces people to say hello, and there’s no judge who will condemn someone for not saying it.'

He added he felt compelled to introduce the rule after an incident at the town hall where a visitor was rude.

A smile costs nothing: Mayor Gerard Plee said the rule is aimed at the 'eternally dissatisfied, the rancorous and grumpy people'

The decree, which comes after a poll found 'lack of manners' was the number one cause of stress for 60 per cent of French population, is aimed at 'the eternally dissatisfied, the rancorous and any other grumpy people'.

The mayor of the northern Oise town, which has just 185 residents, hopes the measure will improve the 'social standards in the municipality'.

A notice has now been pinned up outside the door of the town hall warning visitors of the consequences of any rudeness.

The only exceptions to the rule are on election day and during weddings.

It read: 'Visitors to the Lhéraule municipal offices are required to comply with and observe the social norms of politeness and courtesy...especially by greeting municipal staff upon entering the premises.

'In the case of manifest failure to comply voluntarily with these norms the person concerned will be requested to leave the premises.'
