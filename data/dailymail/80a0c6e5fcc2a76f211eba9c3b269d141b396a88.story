Only 10 days ago, Froch was reported to have been nearing an agreement for a money-spinning bout in Las Vegas against Julio Cesar Chavez Jr.

‘Professional boxing is a business first and foremost, let’s not forget that,’ said Froch. 

'After knocking out (George) Groves I was talking about the Chavez fight happening. It’s nearly there and I’m very optimistic that Eddie Hearn will make an announcement very soon.

‘This fight will take me to Las Vegas. Between beating Mikkel Kessler and speaking about Chavez, I’ve had the two epic fights with George Groves.'
