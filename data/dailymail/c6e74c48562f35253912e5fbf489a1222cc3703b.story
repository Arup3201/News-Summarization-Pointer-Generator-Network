Controversy: The father of 14-year-old Jade Anderson, pictured, who was mauled to death by four dogs earlier this year, has said the decision is 'disgraceful' and 'ludicrous'

Tory ministers sparked outrage last night over plans to cut short a House of Commons law and order debate on dangerous dogs – so MPs can meet the Queen.

They have been accused of changing the Commons timetable to stop it clashing with a reception at Buckingham Palace, hosted by the Queen and Prince Philip.

MPs were preparing for lengthy debates on Tuesday on a crackdown on dangerous dogs and revising Britain’s extradition laws.

But last night, it emerged that the debate has been cut to allow backbench MPs to get to a coveted evening reception at Buckingham Palace.

Instead of finishing at 7pm as expected, discussion is now due to be curtailed at 5.30pm.

It means MPs will be able to get to the Palace according to strict instructions on the gold-embossed invitation by 6.20pm at the latest. 

The change was ordered after  some MPs complained that if the debate went on until 7pm, they would be unable to attend the royal party – a 25-minute walk or 10-minute taxi ride in the rush hour from the Commons.

Coalition sources insisted there is still enough time to debate the Government’s Anti-Social Behaviour, Crime and Policing Bill, which includes new penalties for out-of-control dangerous dogs.

But the decision to cut short the debate was condemned by Michael Anderson, whose 14-year-old step-daughter Jade was killed by four dogs in Atherton, Lancashire.

Out-of-control: One of the dogs who killed the schoolgirl in April. The debate on how to deal with these dangerous animals has been cut by 90 minutes so MPs can go to an event hosted by the Queen and Prince Philip

Mr Anderson, who this week is taking part in a cycle ride to Westminster to highlight calls for tougher laws on dangerous dogs, said  shortening the debate so MPs could attend a royal reception was  ‘disgraceful’ and ‘ludicrous’.

He said: ‘It’s just ridiculous that something so important, that concerns saving lives and affects thousands of people – especially us who lost a daughter – is being changed for some party.

‘I am sure if the Queen was aware of this, she would not approve.

'She mentioned Jade in a speech 
earlier this year.’ The timetable was also attacked by MPs who dispute 
Government claims that the Bill strengthens the rules on UK  subjects 
being extradited to face charges overseas.

Tory MP Dominic Raab, who is seeking 
to amend the legislation, said: ‘Parliament shouldn’t be cut off from 
considering how we stop UK citizens from suffering as a result of our 
extradition regime, just so MPs can glad-hand at the Palace.’

Labour has also criticised the early finish. However, last night, one Minister insisted it had been agreed with Labour Whips to ensure MPs invited to Buckingham Palace got there on time.

He said: ‘It’s a bit rich for them to start whingeing about this now. There are Labour MPs as well as Tories going to the Buckingham Palace party.’
