Kicked out: University of Oklahoma wide receiver Trey Metoyer has been charged with two counts of indecent exposure and suspended indefinitely from the team after two separate incidents

University of Oklahoma wide receiver Trey Metoyer has been charged with two counts of indecent exposure and suspended indefinitely from the team after getting caught masturbating in public.

Cleveland County prosecutors filed the charges Tuesday against Metoyer, 20, a sophomore who is accused of exposing himself to two women in Norman, according to an affidavit filed in the case.

Coach Bob Stoops said Metoyer has not been with the 18th-ranked Sooners since before its game against TCU October 5.

He then added, ‘I do not anticipate that he will return to the team in the future.’

According to the affidavit, the first incident occurred August 29. The victim told a Norman police detective she was smoking on a balcony when she spotted a Grand Am driven by a man in the apartment building's parking lot.

The car ‘pulled into a parking spot’ and the woman noticed that the man was touching his exposed genitals while sitting in the car.

The second incident took place September 17 when Metoyer allegedly approached a woman walking her dog and asked her if he could borrow a pen.

She went into her apartment to get an ink pen and when she came back, Metoyer was masturbating, it says.

The 20-year-old ‘then asked the victim if she would want the pen back,’ the affidavit states.

Earlier this month, the second victim picked Metoyer out of a photo lineup as the man who had exposed himself to her, according to NewsOK.

When questioned by police, the sophomore initially denied the allegations. He later acknowledged them and told police ‘that the incidents were a mistake and he was not thinking clearly at the time.’

Receivers coach Jay Norvell said earlier this month that Metoyer was 'going through some things right now.'

'He's trying to get his hands around it. And so we just wish him the best as he works his way through that,' he told the site SoonerScoop October 1.

A promising five-star recruit from Texas, Metoyer started four of the 11 games he played in last year and played in four games this year, catching two passes for 18 yards with a touchdown, according to the OU sports website.

The 20-year-old initially signed with Oklahoma in 2011, but was forced to spent a semester at Hargrave Military Academy in Virginia due to his lackluster academic performance.
