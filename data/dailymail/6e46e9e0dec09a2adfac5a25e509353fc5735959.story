Biopics have a gruesome obsession with the decay of stardom.

We’ve seen it too many times in recent dramas — Meryl Streep in The Iron Lady, for example, depicting an aged Margaret Thatcher wracked by dementia.

The love affair between Elizabeth Taylor and Richard Burton was the romance of the century. They burned like phosphorus together, with an intensity that made other lives seem feeble glimmers.

With the release last year of Burton’s candid, vivid diaries, it’s a story that was begging to be told on screen.

So why did Burton And Taylor (BBC4) focus on the final sputterings of their great passion, when they met to play Noel Coward’s Private Lives on Broadway?

Elizabeth, the Hollywood child star from Hampstead Garden Suburb, was a bloated wreck in 1983, addicted to pills and booze. Richard, the son of a Port Talbot miner, was less than a year from death, crippled by pain and hollowed out by alcoholism.

There’s a story here — how Taylor, insecure at 50 and yearning for past glories, engineered a reunion with Burton on stage, in the hope their love would be rekindled and they could marry each other for a third time.

But it’s a footnote, an epilogue to the epic feature of their love. The parties, the screaming rows, the  jewellery, the breakdowns — we saw none of it, until the closing minutes of this drama.

And that scene, with the couple doing a drunken keep fit  routine to the strains of Frank Sinatra before falling into bed, outshone everything that had come before.

This production looked lavish. And Helena Bonham Carter did her considerable best — there’s a seam of insanity that glitters in her acting, whether she’s playing a villainess in Harry Potter or a heartless swindler in Les Miserables.

As Liz Taylor, she seemed to make the madness external, to wrap herself in it. At the core was a lonely,  middle-aged woman, swaddled in the trappings of stardom: the venomous personal assistants, the packs of  lap-dogs, the parrot called Alvin that travelled everywhere with her.

Bonham Carter caught the husky drawl and the bored manner to perfection. She looked more like Courteney Cox but that didn’t matter: this was a performance, not an impression.

Dominic West fell far short, however. He looked like a much younger Burton — in 1983, the great actor was jowly and raddled, ripe for the stroke that killed him.

But West sounded like John Humphrys, and he exuded none of the menace, thunder or charisma that had bewitched audiences.

At times he looked more like an accountant than a Shakespearean. The script, by William Ivory, had strong lines that conjured up the aggressive banter between the couple.

Burton, trying to sleep off a hangover while his ex-wife flirted girlishly with him, growled: ‘Elizabeth, I swear to God, if you don’t stop talking, I’m going to climb out of this bed and drive back to the Dorchester in my bloody underpants.’

Homage of the week: In his TV sitcom more than 50 years ago, Tony Hancock did a send-up of the radio series The Archers where he spent five minutes pretending to die — noisily, hammily and shamelessly.

Count Arthur Strong (BBC2) had the sheer chutzpah to reprise the gag. That took some nerve!

But there was a time in their lives when
he would have done exactly what he threatened.

That’s what this drama 
lacked: the colossal flamboyance of Burton and Taylor when they were 
gods.

At least they’re still stars.  Everyone knows who they are. By contrast,
ITV’s new quiz show, Take On The Twisters, didn’t have a clue what it 
was or how it wanted to be.

The set looked like The Weakest Link, the music sounded like a cross 
between Millionaire and Dr Who, the contestants seemed to think they 
were playing Blockbusters and the final round was stolen straight from 
Deal Or No Deal.

The central concept was good: players have to answer general knowledge 
questions fast enough to keep six egg timers from running out. Every 
correct answer means they can turn one timer over: hence the Twisters in
the title.

It might evolve to be good viewing, if the faults are ironed out. But in
this opening edition, much of the format didn’t work, and the show had a
runaway winner before it was halfway through.

It’s hard to keep watching  a long, gruelling ending . . . and that’s as true of quizzes as  of biopics.
