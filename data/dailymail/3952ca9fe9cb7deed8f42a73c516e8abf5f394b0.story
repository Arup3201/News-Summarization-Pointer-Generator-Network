Vicky Torres and Juanita Salas have been camping outside of the Best Buy in Beaumont, California since November 5 in order to be the first ones to snag Thanksgiving deals.

Torres and Salas have set up camp with chairs, sleeping bags and pillows for the Thanksgiving sale beginning Thursday November 27 at 5 p.m.

Big sales: Two women are camping out in front of Best Buy so that they can be the first ones in line for the store's Thanksgiving sales starting at 5pm on Thanksgiving day

The weather is generally in the 70s during the day and in the 40s at night, perfect camping weather that isn't too hot or too cold, say the women.

'The employees like me,' Torres told the Star Tribune.

'Some say that’s dedication and others say that’s stupid,' she said of reaction from customers.

Torres says she's been passing the time by, 'sitting here and watching people.'

'My daughter checks in on me all the time,' she added.

The women have said they want to get a good deal on a television this year and don't mind waiting weeks for one.

'We could have started later, but then we wouldn't be sure to get first in line,' Torres told the Beaumont Patch.

'They only get a few items at the cheaper prices and it’s first come, first served.'

Some have criticized stores like Best Buy for opening on Thanksgiving for fear that their employees will not be able to spend quality time with their families.

Passing the time: The women pass the time by people watching and take turns going home to take showers 

'While we recognize the decision to open on Thanksgiving affects Best Buy employees, customers have made it clear that many of them want to begin shopping on Thanksgiving evening, ' Best Buy said in a statement.

'In recent years, millions of Americans have shopped on Thanksgiving, and our store associates are excited and prepared to help customers fulfill their holiday wish lists,' the statement continued

'Most Thanksgiving evening shifts are filled by employees who volunteer to work.'

In states like Maine, Massachusetts and Rhode Island, stores in those states will not open until Black Friday due to their individual state laws forbidding stores to be open.

Other stores open on Thanksgiving are Target, Macy’s, Kohl’s, Staples, Wal-Mart, Sears, J.C. Penney ,Toys ‘R’ Us, and Radio Shack.

More and more bargain hunters will begin lining up outside stores in order to get the best deal but unlike Torres and Salas, they may not begin lining up for a few more weeks. 

Open of Thanksgiving: Best Buy is one of the stores opening there doors before Black Friday on Thanksgiving day at 5pm despite some complaints from the public calling the holiday work hours unfair for employees
