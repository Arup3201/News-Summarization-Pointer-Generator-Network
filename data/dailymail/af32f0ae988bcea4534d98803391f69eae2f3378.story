An emotional father who lost his six-year-old son in the Newtown school shooting has been heckled by pro-gun activists as he testified at a local hearing on firearm control.Â 

Neil
 Heslin, whose son Jesse was killed in last month's massacre at Sandy 
Hook Elementary, questioned the need for any civilian to own 
semiautomatic, military-style weapon at the state legislative subcommittee hearing in Hartford Connecticut on Monday.

But he was shouted down by members of the audience who shouted 'The Second Amendment' as he spoke.

Victim: Neil Heslin, whose 6-year-old son Jesse Lewis was one of the 20 first-graders killed in the Dec. 14 massacre at Sandy Hook Elementary School, told a legislative subcommittee reviewing gun laws that there is no need for such weapons in homes or on the streets

He said: 'It's 
not a good feeling. Not a good feeling to look at your child laying in a
 casket or looking at your child with a bullet wound to the forehead. 
It's a real sad thing,' said Heslin, who held up a large framed 
photograph of himself and his son.

A handful 
of people at the packed legislative hearing then shouted about their 
Second Amendment rights when Heslin asked if anyone could provide a 
reason for a civilian to own an assault-style weapon.

'We're
 all entitled to our own opinions and I respect their opinions and their
 thoughts,' Heslin said. 'But I wish they'd respect mine and give it a 
little bit of thought.'

The hearing by a 
legislative subcommittee reviewing gun laws offered the first public 
testimony by family members of those killed at Sandy Hook Elementary, 
where a gunman slaughtered 20 first-grade children and six women.

Parents of children 
killed in the Newtown school shooting called for better enforcement of 
gun laws and tougher penalties for violators.

Adam 
Lanza had killed his mother in their home across town and then drove to 
the school to carry out the shooting before committing suicide. The 
testimony was expected to continue late into the night.

Members
 of the Connecticut State Police firearms training unit brought weapons 
to the hearing to provide state lawmakers with a short tutorial on 
what's legal and illegal under the state's current assault weapons ban, 
passed in 1993.

Mattson of the Connecticut State Police holds up a Bushmaster AR-15 rifle, the same make and model of gun used by Adam Lanza in the Sandy Hook School shooting, for a demonstration during a hearing of a legislative subcommittee reviewing gun laws

The group included an AR-15, the same type of rifle that
 was used in the Sandy Hook shooting.

Many gun
 rights advocates, wearing yellow stickers that read: 'Another 
Responsible Gun Owner,' were among the estimated 2,000 people at the 
hearing.

Metal detectors were installed at the entrance to the 
Legislative Office Building, and some people waited as long as two hours
 to get into the building in Hartford.

Many spoke about the need to protect their rights and their families' safety.

'The
 Second Amendment does not protect our right to hunt deer,' said Andrew 
Hesse of Middletown. 'It protects our right to self-preservation and 
preservation of our family. The right to bear arms.'

Elizabeth
 Drysdale, a single mother from Waterbury, spoke of three recent 
incidents that caused her to fear for her safety. She said she should be
 able to choose the size of magazine and type of firearm to defend 
herself.

'Don't my children and I deserve your support and consideration to be safe,' she asked lawmakers.

Judy
 Aron of West Hartford said bills such as those requiring gun owners to 
have liability insurance and ammunition taxes only harm lawful gun 
owners.

Every gun owner did not pull the trigger that was pulled by Adam Lanza, she said.

The
 state's gun manufacturers, meanwhile, urged the subcommittee to not 
support legislation that could put the state's historic gun 
manufacturing industry at risk.

Mourning: Mark Mattioli and his wife Cindy, right, lost their son, James, in the Sandy Hook massacre. The problem is not guns, but rather a lack of civility, Mattioli said

Mark Mattioli,
 whose 6-year-old son James was killed at Sandy Hook, got a standing 
ovation when he said there are plenty of gun laws but they're not 
properly enforced.

He urged lawmakers to address the culture of 
violence.

'It's a simple concept. We need 
civility across our nation,' he said. 'What we're seeing are symptoms of
 a bigger problem. This is a symptom. The problem is not gun laws. The 
problem is a lack of civility.'

Two Southbury 
natives who survived a mass shooting last year at a movie theater in 
Aurora, Colo., urged lawmakers to address online, private guns sales 
that don't require background checks.

Stephen Barton and Ethan 
Rodriguez-Torrent also want to require background checks for purchases 
of so-called long guns and not just handguns.

State
 Rep. Arthur O'Neill, R-Southbury, who has known Rodriguez-Torrent since
 he was a child, predicted state lawmakers will reach a compromise on 
guns.

He said lawmakers' minds have changed since the Dec. 14 school massacre.

'Dec. 13 was one way of looking at the world, and Dec. 15 is a different way of looking at the world,' he said.
