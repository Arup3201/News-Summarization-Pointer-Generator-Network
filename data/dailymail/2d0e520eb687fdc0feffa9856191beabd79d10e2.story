It has been described as 'the poster child' for shoddy British manufacturing and ridiculed for its 'dreadful' handling - but the Austin Allegro has somehow escaped the label of 'worst car ever'.

The vehicle came in at number ten on a list voted for by readers of motor magazine Auto Express - with the South Korean-made SsangYong Rodius taking the undesirable top spot.  

One critic likened its appearance to a 'melted hearse' and said: 'If it were human, not even its mother could love it.'

Number one: The South Korean-made SsangYong Rodius was voted the worst car of all time

Number two: G-Wiz, pictured being test driven by David Cameron, came in at number two for being 'ugly as sin - a tiny, uncomfortable box'

A Top Gear review of the car said: 'Designed by a Brit, the Rodius is a vehicle of such cosmic ineptitude that it must surely have been done via pre-Skype in the days of glitching dial-up modems by a team of visually impaired misanthropes.

'The only thing worse than looking at the Rodius is driving it.'

Second on the list of embarrassing motors was the Reva G-Wiz electric car which was described as 'ugly as sin'.

Cheap foreign imports have also earned strong places in the list of shambolic vehicles. 

Bronze medal went to 'ugly duckling' the Chrysler PT Cruiser Cabriolet while fourth on the list was the Polish-made FSO Polonez.

Number three: The Chrysler PT Cruiser Cabriolet was slammed by one reader as 'a novelty car that was no fun at all'

Number four: The Polish-made FSO Polonez came in at fourth on the list with reader saying it 'lacked any desirability at all'

Number five: Rover's City Rover was 'poorly received from the off, with its build quality coming in for particular criticism'

Coming in at five on the shameful list was the Rover City Rover which was heavily criticised after being released in 2003.

Japan, known for its manufacturing prowess, will no doubt want to forget number six and seven on the list- the Mitsubishi Mirage and Suzuki X-90 - which one reader said had 'zero off-road ability'.

Ranked number eight in the worst cars of all time was the Morris Marina, which one reader said had 'terrible handling and poor build quality'.

Number nine, the Lada Riva, was also condemned by motor fans with one saying it was 'poor to drive, uncomfortable and basic in the extreme.

And last but not least was the Austin Allegro, manufactured by British Leyland from 1973 until 1982.

Jeremy Clarkson once candidly said: 'Deciding which one is worse (the Austin Allegro or Morris Marina), is like deciding which leg you'd rather have amputated.' 

The Allegro was named 'the worst British car ever made' in a 2008 poll by The Sun but Auto Express readers have been kinder to the 1970s model, putting it last in their list. 

Number six: The Mitsubishi Mirage, another Japanese flop, was said to be overpriced with poor handling

Number seven: The Suzuki X-90 is not a car Japan will be proud of, with readers saying it had 'awful handling'

Number eight: The Morris Marina was condemned by Auto Express readers as 'an utterly awful car'

Number nine: The Lada Riva, produced in the Eastern Bloc, was said to be 'uncomfortable and basic in the extreme'

Number 10: The Austin Allegro was described as 'everything bad about British car manufacturing in the seventies'

Below are the top ten worst cars as voted for by Auto Express readers with their comments:

1) SsangYong Rodius: 'It's time these were taken away and destroyed.'  

2) Reva G-Wiz electric car: 'Slow, not very safe and ugly as sin. A tiny, uncomfortable box.'

 3) Chrysler PT Cruiser Cabriolet: 'A real ugly duckling. A lack of refinement and driver enjoyment plus poor quality cabin. A novelty car that was no fun at all.'

4) FSO Polonez: 'Cheap, performed poorly and lacked any desirability at all.'

5) Rover City Rover: 'Poorly received from off, with build quality coming in for particular criticism.'

6) Mitsubishi Mirage: 'Poor handling and a very low-rent feel and it doesn't even have a super-cheap price to reflect that.'

7) Suzuki X-90: 'Who wanted a two-seater convertible mini-SUV? Nobody, especially when it had awful handling and zero off-road ability.'

8) Morris Marina: 'Terrible handling and poor build quality meant it was an utterly awful car,' said one reader.

9) Lada Riva: 'Poor to drive, uncomfortable and basic in the extreme. Virtually any car of the same age will trump this in any category.'

10) Austin Allegro: 'The poster child for everything bad about British car manufacturing in the seventies. Looked awful and handled dreadfully.'
