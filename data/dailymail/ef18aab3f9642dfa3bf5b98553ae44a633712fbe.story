A funeral director's wife, whose husband was yesterday jailed for life for her murder, left a diary detailing his infidelity and her concerns over their marriage.

John Taylor, 61, was told he must serve at least 17 years behind bars after a jury unanimously found him guilty of killing Alethea, 63, his wife of 16 years, despite her body never having been found.

He had callously ‘spun a web of lies’ to cover his tracks, telling friends his wife had developed ‘some form of dementia’ and vanished without warning.

In fact, he had fallen in love with 
widow Alison Dearden, 53, after organising her husband’s funeral, and 
murdered his wife and hid her body so they could be together.

After a month-long trial at Worcester Crown Court, a jury yesterday saw through his ‘blatant lies’ and convicted him of her murder.

They had earlier heard how the funeral director’s relationship with his wife had become strained after he she discovered he had embarked on an affair with Mrs Dearden in the summer of 2011.

In a diary discovered by officers, she had written of her concerns that her husband had become 'besotted with a certain widow'.

Michael Burrows, prosecuting, said Taylor had used the couple's joint bank account to buy a 'love nest', which he was renovating so he could eventually move in with his mistress.

Diary: Mrs Taylor wrote in this document of her suspicions that her husband was having an affair

Jailing him, Justice Julian Flaux told him: 'Since her body has never been found, only you know what became of her.

'The jury has rejected your defence that you were not responsible.

'You clearly perceived her as an obstacle to happiness with Alison.  She had discovered the affair and as her notebooks bear out you were scared she might reveal it.

'There is a dark and violent side to your personality, which perhaps only Alethea knew. Your anger and frustration boiled over.

'You attacked her either in the bedroom where her blood was found or elsewhere and put her, bleeding, on the bed then smothered her with a pillow. You then drove her body away in your car.

Alethea Taylor helped solve her own murder from beyond the grave - by writing diaries where she branded her evil husband 'Mr Nasty'

'You have lived all your life in rural Herefordshire and were well able to find an isolated place where she has not been found.

'A particularly serious aggravating feature is the concealment. You have even now failed to disclose her whereabouts with all the agony that causes her family and friends.

'You have shown no remorse because you continue to deny you murdered her.'

Mrs Taylor went missing in January last year and her disappearance was reported to police by her husband.

Officers found her blood on bedding at the couple's home and on the rear seats of Taylor's car.

The
funeral director claimed the blood was from a nose bleed, but a 
forensic scientist said it had not dripped and probably resulted from 
direct contact with the sheets.

Taylor was also seen vacuuming the 
boot of his vehicle outside his home - despite telling police he was 
somewhere else at the time.

Taylor
claimed his wife was still alive when he left their home in Orleton, 
Herefordshire, on the morning of January 19, but that she then 
disappeared.

He claimed
to have tried to contact his wife by telephone several times after she 
went missing but cell site analysis showed that he had only called her 
once and hung up after eight seconds.

Taylor maintained that if his wife was dead, he was not responsible.

Mrs Taylor's nightdress was missing from the house but her glasses, passport, bank cards and a bracelet were all left behind. 

Taylor was 'keen to spread around' 
the idea she was 'in some way losing her mind' to cover up for her 
disappearance, the court heard.

He
told police he had once found his wife 'crying and disorientated' in a 
lane, but never took her to see a doctor despite his professed concerns.

And Mrs Taylor had not confided in friends about any problems with memory loss, the jury was told.

Rita
Tetsill said she had known her for 40 years and was 'gobsmacked' when 
Taylor told her his wife was 'suffering with dementia'.

Mrs Tetsill said she had 'never' seen anything to make her fear for her friend's mental health.

She
added that Alethea 'always sent everyone cards, birthday, anniversary, 
Easter and New Year - she never forgot, but since she went missing I 
haven't received one letter.'

Both
Mrs Tetsill and a second friend, Eve Martin, told the jury they were 
surprised when Taylor told them separately his wife had 'wandered off' 
on occasion.

Search: But despite a major police operation, Mrs Taylor's body has still never been found

The court heard Mrs Taylor's first marriage ended in the 1980s when her then husband had an affair.

After the break-up Mrs Taylor met her future husband.

Taylor left his then wife and later moved to a bungalow in Orleton with Mrs Taylor, whom he married in 1996.

David Elliott, Sector Crown Prosecutor from West Midlands Crown Prosecution Service, said Taylor had ‘spun a web of lies in order to avoid justice’.

‘A jury today has seen through his deceit,’ he added. ‘Taylor was unhappy in his marriage and he was having an affair. His wife found out and in a diary which was recovered from the house, Mrs Taylor highlighted her concerns at her husband’s infidelity and the future of their marriage.

‘We will never know how Mrs Taylor was killed or where her body has been concealed. Only the defendant has the knowledge and answers to these questions.

‘We would encourage him to inform the authorities of where he has hidden the body so that Mrs Taylor can be finally laid to rest and her family and friends can get some form of closure in this tragic case.’
