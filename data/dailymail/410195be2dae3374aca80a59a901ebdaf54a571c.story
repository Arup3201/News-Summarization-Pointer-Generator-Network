A hospital in southern Italy arranged for a pregnant woman to have a miscarriage so that she could claim compensation for the loss of the unborn baby in a fake road traffic accident, it is alleged. 

Investigators say that a doctor deliberately induced the birth of the heavily pregnant 37-year-old woman, as part of a huge road traffic accident insurance scam at the Corigliano Calabro hospital in the southern region of Calabria.

The woman deliberately got pregnant, then at seven months presented herself at the emergency room claiming to have had a car crash, it is alleged.

Nurses told police that the doctor then induced the birth. The foetus was alive when it was born, they claimed, but was denied oxygen and left to die.

The head of road traffic police in the province of Cosenza, Domenico Provenzano, told a press conference, 'All it would have taken was a mouthful of oxygen and the baby would be alive today.'

The 57-year-old doctor and the pregnant woman split the insurance payout, it is alleged. They are now both under house arrest along with two other people accused of infanticide, forgery, fraud, embezzlement and corruption.

The horrific case came to light as part of an investigation into 144 people connected to an insurance scam at the hospital worth millions of euros.

According to the investigators doctors at the hospital produced medical certificates for non-existent conditions and details of treatment that never took place, while a radiologist attributed X-rays of injured patients to healthy people.
