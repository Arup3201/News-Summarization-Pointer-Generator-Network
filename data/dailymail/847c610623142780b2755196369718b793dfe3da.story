Danish supermarket workers were shocked when their banana delivery turned out to be 100kg of cocaine mistakenly sent to them by Colombian drug gang

Staff at the Coop chain got a big surprise when they opened crates from Columbia and found the drug inside, which has a street value of £12 million.

The powder was discovered in Aarhus, western Denmark, when workers noticed that some of the boxes were heavier than others.

Mistaken delivery: A consignment of smuggled drugs in banana boxes ended up at a Danish supermarket instead of on the streets

Smuggled: Last year drug smugglers packed hollowed out fruit with 16.5lbs of cocaine worth £750,000 in an attempt to smuggle it into the country by plane

A Coop spokesman said more bags with white powder were found later in a separate shipment from Colombia at a central dispatch depot in Copenhagen.

The company has contacted its Colombian supplier. 

Police are investigating, but have not made any arrests.

Last year drug smugglers packed hollowed out fruit with 16.5lbs of cocaine worth £750,000 in an attempt to smuggle it into the country by plane.

Hidden among a delivery of fruit and vegetables, customs officers discovered the illegal haul when the flight from Ghana landed at Heathrow airport,

The cocaine was discovered inside plantains, a banana-like fruit, which had been filled with packages of the drug and resealed before being packed with other products.

Border staff believe the same gang was responsible for sending 1.5-tonne of cannabis hidden in a shipment of fruit and vegetables from Ghana also intercepted at the airport the previous day.

The contraband was worth £4.3 million when sold by dealers on the street
