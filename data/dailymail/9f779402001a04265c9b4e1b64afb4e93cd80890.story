Ed Miliband has admitted he worries that being Labour leader means his sons think he spends too much time on his phone.

He made a rare appearance on the school run with Daniel and Samuel and invited the TV cameras along as part of efforts to present him as a family man in the run up to the general election, after wife Justine also gave an interview.

But one relative who will not be making an appearance on the campaign trail is his brother David, who will remain in the US where he moved after being beaten in the bruising Labour leadership contest.

As part of his profile interview with ITV's Good Morning Britain, Mr Miliband took his sons to school, but then let slip that he rarely does it.

He said: 'It's a huge pleasure to be able to see them during the day, it's a rare treat for me.'

Mr Miliband also admitted that he worries about the impact of his job on his sons. He said: 'Yeah I do worry about that, I do worry about that. It's a constant battle and it's a constant thing that I've got to just be conscious of to make sure whatever job I'm doing now and in the future, that I make sure that I make sure that there's that time for them.

'I don't want them looking back and thinking, 'well Dad was never around' 'Dad was always on the phone', I think they probably would say Dad is on the phone a lot but I don't want them thinking you know I was just, I was never there.'

The Labour leader said that his brother, David, would not be returning to Britain to take part in the general election campaign

Ed Miliband revealed how he tries to keep romance alive with his wife Justine.

While David and Samantha Cameron regularly have a night out in London, the Milibands prefer to stay closer to home.

'Nothing we like more than a night in, whether it’s watching a box set or just spending some time together,' Mr Miliband said.

'Well the last thing was, not exactly a box set, Broadchurch two which we really enjoyed.'

He revealed he had tried to explain what being a party leader means to the five and four-year-old.

'We've tried, we've sort of had a bit of a discussion about the red team, we're the red team. We've even talked about the debates a bit, what Daniel calls 'the argument about the arguments'.'

Mr Miliband revealed how he has even enlisted Daniel into calling for David Cameron to take part in TV debates: 'They do know who David Cameron is, Daniel thought it was very important he turned up to the debate.'

The Labour leader said that his brother, David, would not be returning to Britain to take part in the general election campaign.

Instead his older sibling - who he defeated for the leadership in 2010 - would be concentrating on his job in New York running the International Rescue Committee charity.

'We had a bruising leadership contest four-and-a-bit years ago, he's moved on from that, I've moved on from that.

'He's got his own thing that he's doing and I think he wants to carry on focusing on that. One of the reasons he left after the leadership contest was because he didn't want the soap opera.'

Mr Miliband dismissed the controversy over the disclosure that he has two kitchens in his north London home.

'This election isn't going to be decided by my kitchen or kitchens, it's going to be decided by what's happening to people in their lives,' he said.

While he said that he was confident that he would win the general election on May 7, he insisted that he was not yet 'measuring the curtains' for No 10.

'I think that we are going to win the election but I'm not measuring the curtains and I think it's really important we don't do that,' he said.
