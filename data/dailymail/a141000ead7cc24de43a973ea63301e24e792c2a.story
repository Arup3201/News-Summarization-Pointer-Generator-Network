A Chinese restaurant once frequented by England captain Steven Gerrard and his wife was closed down after a customer found a cockroach in their food.

The horrified diner was given the disgusting dish at Shangri-La in central Liverpool, and reported the stomach-churning find to the council.

After the authorities were told about 
the cockroach, they launched a surprise inspection in October 2012 and 
immediately closed the restaurant, which was popular with Steven and Alex Gerrard before they married.

Filth: Evidence of the insects was found on floor as well

Location: The restaurant is in central Liverpool, and used to be a favourite of England captain Steven Gerrard

As well as an infestation of cockroaches, investigators found that the food preparation areas had been visited by rodents, and found a pile of droppings inside a spice container.

The eatery was also criticised for using dirty equipment to prepare and store its food.

However, it was allowed to re-open 
after two weeks after a deep clean and a visit from exterminators, and 
is still trading today. Its website displays a 4/5 food hygiene rating.

Shangri-La managing director Mrs Siew Hong Ho has now pleaded guilty to nine breaches of the Food Hygiene Regulations. 

Vermin: Rodent droppings were also found around the kitchen, including in this spice container

Insects: The bugs plaguing the eatery, which now boasts a 4/5 hygiene rating, were collected on this piece of card

Dirty: The general cleanliness of the kitchen was also criticised by inspectors

Grim: The restaurants managing director pleaded guilty to food hygiene offences

She was fined £2,200 and told to pay costs of £2,000 in light of the shocking inspection in October 2012.

District Judge Shaw said that the conditions in Shangri-La were a disgrace.

He added that Mrs Ho could not have 
looked in the kitchen or carried out cleaning and was more concerned 
about profit than ensuring hygiene standards were up to scratch.

Tim
 Moore, a member of Liverpool's council, said: 'This was a well-known 
restaurant in Liverpool which ended up having to be shut down because of
 the appalling conditions.

'That a restaurant should have such little regard for the health of their customers is beyond belief”

After the inspection the restaurant was closed immediately and remained closed for a further two weeks while extensive cleaning to the kitchen was carried out and a pest control contractor came in to treat the infestation.

In 2007 Mrs Gerard - then Miss Curran - was arrested after police were called to a brawl at the restaurant.

She was questioned by officers over an 
alleged assault, during which an 18-year-old was hit by a bottle. She 
was granted bail and the charged were later dropped.
