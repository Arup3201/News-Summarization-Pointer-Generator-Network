A disabled Yazidi boy has been rescued from certain death in the Iraqi desert after his parents were left with no choice but to abandon him as ISIS militants forced them to flee their home.

The unidentified child, who appears to be about three years old, is paralysed down one side of his body and was found by Kurdish fighters in the desert outside the town of Sinjar in northern Iraq.

Doctors believe he was left lying on his back without shelter in 50C temperatures for up to a day, and - due to his paralysis - was unable to move himself to shelter his eyes from the blazing sun.

Helpless: The unidentified child, who appears to be about three years old, is paralysed down one side of his body and was found by Kurdish fighters in the desert outside the town of Sinjar in northern Iraq

Treatment: Doctors say the child's eyes dried out after spending up to 24 hours staring directly into the sun because his disability meant he was unable to turn his body to face in a different direction

The boy's plight was revealed in a video by the BBC's World Affairs correspondent Paul Wood.

The child is now receiving treatment in an unidentified hospital in northern Iraq and is expected to survive - although he may have long-lasting or possibly even permanent damage to his eyesight.

Doctors say his eyes dried out after spending up to 24 hours staring directly into the sun because his disability meant he was unable to turn his body to face in a different direction.

It is not known exactly why the young boy was abandoned, or where his parents are now,

Some at the hospital believe his mother may have had to make the heartbreaking choice of which child to leave behind when she became too weak to carry them as the family escaped ISIS.

One refugee has put forward the view that the boy's mother dropped him and ran off in a panic when ISIS militants began firing at their group.

News of the boy's discovery comes amid increasing concern for up to 1,500 Yazidi women currently being held by ISIS.

There
 are fears that many are being forced to convert to Islam and marry 
their abductors after witnesses in the town of Sinjar said younger women
 had been separated from the main group.

A Japanese man believed to be a mercenary operating in Syria has been filmed being tied up and interrogated at knifepoint by ISIS jihadists speaking in British accents.

Japan says it is investigating claims that one of its citizens has been captured by militants near Aleppo, as evidence emerged that the captured man appeared to be a self-styled security contractor.

A video clip posted on YouTube showed a T-shirt clad man lying on the ground being questioned by unidentified persons and responding that he was Japanese and that his name was Haruna Yukawa.

He told his captives that he was a journalist and doctor, but reports have subsequently emerged that his name matches that of the chief executive of a self-described 'private mercenary' and military firm.

Up to 3,000 women and girls have been kidnapped by the jihadis in the north of Iraq in just a fortnight - and hundreds of men who refuse to convert to Islam are understood to have been massacred.

The kidnappings appear to have happened in villages where residents took up arms against ISIS - and the women are being held separately from the men in IS-controlled Tal Afar, east of Mount Sinjar.

Some 200,000 people escaped to safety in Iraq's Kurdish region, but others remain on the mountain.

Donatella Rovera, Amnesty International's senior crisis response adviser, told the Agence France-Presse news agency: ‘The victims are of all ages, from babies to elderly men and women.’

‘It seems they took away entire families, all those who did not manage to flee. We fear the men may have been executed.’

Two women - Leila Khalaf and Wadhan Khalaf - were among those kidnapped from Mujamma Jazira village, said their relative Dakhil Atto Solo.

He added that the abductions happened after residents tried to resist the IS attack, telling AFP: ‘Of course we tried to defend our villages, but they had much bigger weapons.

‘All we had were our Kalashnikovs. They executed 300 men, and took the women to their prisons.  Only God can save them now.’ Their children, said Mr Solo, were rescued by the family.

But the women were in a house surrounded by IS. We had to escape. Now, the children cry for their mothers all the time. "Mama, mama," they wail. But there is no mama, we tell them.’

His comments on the dire situation came 
as Islamic extremists shot dead scores of Yazidi men, lining them up in 
small groups and opening fire with assault rifles before seizing their 
wives and children.

A Yazidi politician cited the mass 
killing in Kocho as evidence that his people were still at risk after a 
week of US and Iraqi air strikes on the militants.

Meanwhile, warplanes targeted insurgents around a large dam that was captured by the IS extremist group earlier this month.

US Central Command said the strikes 
were launched under the authority to support humanitarian efforts in 
Iraq, as well as to protect US staff and facilities.

Central
 Command says the nine air strikes conducted so far had destroyed or 
damaged four armoured personnel carriers, seven armed vehicles, two 
Humvees and an armoured vehicle.

Iraqi troops and Kurdish fighters have reclaimed control of the country's largest dam from ISIS militants who captured it less than two weeks ago, an army spokesman in Baghdad said.

The development marks the first major victory for Iraqi and Kurdish troops since U.S. airstrikes began earlier this month - and could significantly boost the morale of forces trying to liberate territory that was overrun by the jihadist group in a lightning advance in June.

The Mosul Dam - spanning the Tigris River just north of Iraq's second-largest city - holds great strategic value as the complex supplies electricity and water to a large part of the country.

Alarmed by the ISIS militants' continued advance and the brutal slaughter of anybody who gets in their way, the U.S. and Iraqi airstrikes pounded the area in the past two days.

The U.S. military said its forces conducted nine strikes on Saturday and another 16 yesterday in efforts to help the Iraqis retake the dam.

Army spokesman Lt. Gen. Qassim al-Moussawi said Kurdish peshmerga forces and Iraqi anti-terrorism troops 'fully liberated' the dam this morning and 'hoisted the Iraqi flag over it.'

Al-Mousawi added that the troops were backed by a joint aerial support, but he didn't specify whether there were any U.S. airstrikes in the area of the dam this morning.

The dam is around 30 miles from the city of Mosul, and 280 miles from the Iraqi capital Baghdad

Local residents and others in the area could not immediately be contacted to confirm the security forces' recapture of the dam.

The U.S. launched airstrikes against ISIS in Iraq more than a week ago in a bid to halt its advance across the north.

But the Sunni militants remain in control of vast swaths of northern and western Iraq, including the city of Mosul, as well as much of northeastern Syria.

Some 1.5 million people have been displaced by fighting in Iraq since the Islamic State's rapid advance began in June.

The scale of the humanitarian crisis prompted the U.N. to declare its highest level of emergency lasts week.

The decision to launch airstrikes marked the first direct U.S. military intervention in Iraq since the last American troops withdrew in 2011.

They are widely considered to reflect growing international concern about ISIS' activities.
