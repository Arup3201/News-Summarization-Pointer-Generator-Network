MPs are calling for VAT to be scrapped on flights for children in order to save the average family around £200 on their summer holiday.

More than 30 MPs of all parties are backing a motion to stop charging Air Passenger Duty on flights for children who are between the ages of two and 11.

They say that families with school-age children already pay a premium for having to travel in the school holidays, and should not have to pay extra punitive taxes.

Travelling in economy class on a long-haul flight to Florida attracts at least £94 in tax per person, so scrapping the tax would save a family with two children nearly £200.

For a short-haul flight to Spain, the tax adds £13 to the cost for every passenger.

Nearly four out of five British adults (78 per cent) say that an annual family holiday should be part of every child’s life, according to a poll by ComRes out today.

And three-quarters of UK adults believe that it is unfair that British families pay a flight tax while families from other countries do not get charged.

The poll was commissioned by a campaign group called Scrap the Tax on Family Flights, which has pointed out that the Air Passenger Duty paid by British families is the highest in the world.

Only four other European countries levy a similar tax, and UK passengers pay the most, more than double the next highest country, Germany.

Even families who are planning a ‘staycation’ can be hit by the tax if they decide to take a domestic flight. Two-thirds of those polled said that children under 12 should be exempt from Air Passenger Duty in the same way that children are exempt from other taxes, such as VAT on clothing and some food.

Dale Keller, a spokesman for the campaign, said: ‘The tax on children’s flights is a strain on family budgets.

‘Given that the tax is levied at the highest rates in the world, this tax surely fails to meet the Government’s own “family test”.

‘Scrapping Air Passenger Duty on children’s flights will help to make an annual holiday more affordable for hard-working and hard-pressed families, at a minimal cost to the Government.’

Tory MP Andrew Bridgen, the sponsor of the Early Day Motion which has been signed by MPs, said: ‘It’s important that hard-working families across the UK have the opportunity to enjoy a family holiday once a year.

‘Scrapping the tax on children’s flights is a great way for the Government to help by making holidays more affordable. I am calling on the Government to scrap the tax on children’s flights and help families enjoy the well-earned break they deserve.’

Jonathan Isaby, chief executive of the TaxPayers’ Alliance, said: ‘It is wrong that a week in the sun comes with such a huge tax bill, as the taxman chases holidaymakers all the way to the departure gate.

‘These taxes are not only too high but hit those on lower incomes the hardest.

‘Stealth taxes are unfair and must be abolished. It is time for the Chancellor to give families a break.’
