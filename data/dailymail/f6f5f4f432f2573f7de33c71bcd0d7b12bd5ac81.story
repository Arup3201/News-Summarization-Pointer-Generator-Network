Professor Sir Rory Collins said studies had created 'misleading uncertainty' over statins

Doctors are putting lives at risk by exaggerating the side effects of statins, an expert warns.

Professor Sir Rory Collins said recent studies had created 'misleading uncertainty' about the drugs.

He claimed unjustified concerns about side effects meant statins were not being prescribed enough, possibly causing more deaths than the MMR scandal.

But critics accused him of 'fear-mongering', and said it was important for patients to be warned about the potential dangers.

More than seven million Britons with 
high cholesterol take statins to cut the risk of heart attacks and 
strokes. The NHS says the drugs save 7,000 lives a year.

Proposed changes to prescription guidelines mean they could soon be prescribed to 12million patients.

But
 two recent articles in the British Medical Journal have claimed statins
 cause harmful side effects, and do not necessarily reduce mortality.

Professor
 Collins, of Oxford University, said the papers by John Abramson, from 
Harvard Medical School, and British cardiologist Aseem Malhotra were 
misleading.

He added: 'Statins are given to people at elevated risk of heart attacks and strokes.

'If
 people at elevated risk stop taking their statins – or don't start 
taking their statins – then they will have unnecessary heart attacks and
 strokes, there will be unnecessary deaths from vascular causes. This is
 a serious disservice to medicine.'

He said the uncertainty over statins 
was more serious than the MMR scare, when a researcher claimed the jabs 
could cause autism, leading to many parents refusing to have their 
children vaccinated.

He added: 'The papers are far worse in
 terms of the harm they have done, and [the uncertainty] is probably 
killing more people... than that on the MMR vaccine.'

BMJ editor Dr 
Fiona Godlee said the articles were well referenced and peer reviewed, 
and insisted that significant medical issues deserved to be debated 
openly.

She added: 'It's 
important that the public understand when we're talking about extending 
statins to people at low risk, that the balance between benefits and 
harms becomes much more important.'

Statins are offered to those with a 20 per cent risk of a heart attack or stroke in the next ten years.

But following a study by Professor Collins, health chiefs recommended in February that they should be given to those with a 10 per cent risk.

But critics say over-prescribing to low-risk patients could lead to muscle weakness, kidney problems, diabetes and depression.

Dr Abramson said his study showed statins did not cut deaths by much, adding: 'Dr Collins is fear-mongering when he says lives will be lost as a result of our calculations.'

Aseem Malhotra, of Croydon University Hospital in South London, said pills were a poor substitute for a good diet and more exercise.

But analysis at Imperial College London of 29 trials of statins involving more than 80,000 people said the drugs had almost no side effects.

Statins could ease the symptoms of lung- disease patients, researchers said last night.

They found the drugs could be an alternative to long-term antibiotic treatment for those with chronic lung problems.

Although statins are prescribed for people at risk of heart attack, they also have anti-inflammatory properties. Researchers at the University of Edinburgh gave the drugs to patients with a lung condition known as bronchiectasis.

The life-threatening and disabling disease affects one in 1,000 adults, leading to inflammation in the lungs and airways that causes debilitating coughing fits and chest infections.

The team found a high daily dose of statins over six months reduced the amount of coughing for 12 out of the 30 patients in the study.

Patients could also better tolerate gentle exercise and walk further than before, and had fewer flare-ups of the disease and less inflammation in their airways.

Six stopped taking statins before the study ended because of side effects such as headaches, but there were no serious adverse reactions.

The findings, published today in the journal Lancet Respiratory Medicine, suggest statins could offer an alternative to long-term antibiotic treatment, which raises the risk of infection from antibiotic-resistant strains of bacteria such as MRSA or clostridium difficile.

The cause of bronchiectasis is not known for most patients, but it has been linked to infections such as whooping cough and pneumonia.

Study leader Dr Pallavi Mandal said: 'There are few effective treatments for bronchiectasis, so these are encouraging findings. Larger studies are needed to find out whether statins could be useful as a long-term treatment for patients.'
