Apology: David Duckenfield says he never had the chance to say sorry over the Hillsborough disaster

The police chief on duty during the Hillsborough disaster today said that he had never previously apologised for lying to officials because he had 'never found an opportunity' to do so.

David Duckenfield told the inquest into the deaths of 96 Liverpool fans during the FA Cup semi-final in April 1989 that he had not spoken out because was worried about being misrepresented.

The former officer also admitted he was 'possibly in denial' over his misleading statement that a gate had been forced open by fans, leading to a deadly crush on the terraces of the Sheffield stadium.

He told the jury he was a Freemason at the time of the accident, but said he hoped that was not a factor in his promotion to the position of chief superintendent.

And he denied taking part in a 'cover-up' designed to divert blame from the police by ascribing the disaster to Liverpool fans' bad behaviour.

Yesterday, Mr Duckenfield said he 'apologised unreservedly' to the families of the victims who were killed in the opening minutes of the game between Liverpool and Nottingham Forest.

Shortly before kick-off the officer - who had never previously overseen a major football match - ordered a gate to be opened in order to ease overcrowding outside the ground, but this allowed fans to rush into to already packed terraces.

When fans started dying, Mr Duckenfield told Football Association officials that 'some fans have got in through a gate', which he now admits was a 'terrible lie'.

Rajiv Menon QC, lawyer for the victims' families, asked him why it took him 26 years to 'come clean' over his 'critical mistakes'.

Mr Duckenfield, 70, replied: 'I was possibly in denial and I never found a venue or an opportunity where I could meet with someone and speak to them honestly and openly and ensure that my thought and my feelings would be reported fairly.

'Yesterday this court gave me the opportunity to sit here and apologise fully for the first time without fear of anybody misrepresenting what I was saying.'

He denied saying anything inaccurate to FA officials Graham Kelly and Glen Kirton, but confessed he had told a 'lie by omission' for failing to mention that he gave the order to open the gate, and added that it was his family who told him what he had done.

He said: 'I have spoken to my family, who are genuine people, and I have said I am troubled by this situation and they said to me, "Well you obviously lied because you didn't tell the whole truth."'

Mr Duckenfield, who was promoted to be an area commander at South Yorkshire Police two weeks before the semi-final, told the jury that he was not a 'reasonably competent match commander' due to his lack of experience.

Asked if he was a member of the Freemasons at the time of the disaster, Mr Duckenfield said, 'I was,' adding that he had joined the organisation in 1975 and was made Worshipful Master of his local lodge in 1990.

He said he did not know whether the chief constable of his force or other senior officers were in the Masons because it was not seen as 'acceptable' to be a senior policeman and a Freemason.

Mr Menon asked if Mr Duckenfield's promotion to chief superintendent in March 1989 was anything to do with his membership of the Masons. He replied: 'I would not know but I would hope not. Nobody ever spoke to me about it.'

At one point Mr Menon put it to Mr Duckenfield that there had been a 'false narrative' after the disaster which sought to blame Liverpool fans for what had happened and conceal the truth about police failings.

After pausing to consider his answer, Mr Duckenfield replied: 'I disagree. There was no conspiracy as far as I am concerned.'

Rejecting claims that he suspected there were fatalities by the time he spoke to Mr Kelly, Mr Duckenfield added: 'I don't think I was involved in any cover-up whatsoever.

'My main objective was a rescue operation and to do the very best I could for all concerned. It was chaotic, hectic, stressful.'

After claiming that no one in the court room would understand the position he found himself in, Mr Duckenfield was asked why he had concealed the truth from Mr Kelly.

'Sir, I said yesterday, I don't know,' Mr Duckenfield responded.

Mr Menon then said to the former officer: 'That's not the way that a competent match commander behaves, is it Mr Duckenfield, lying to the chief executive of the Football Association when people are dying on the pitch feet away?'

Mr Duckenfield answered: 'Sir, under normal circumstances, as I have said, outside in the street or in an office, it is not the normal way you would expect.

'But we are not talking about normal circumstances, we are talking about a massive tragedy and me doing my best under very difficult circumstances.'

Asked if he had always been consistent in his account of what he said in the control box, the former chief superintendent said: 'It may be that my recollections over 26 years, or what I have said about Mr Kelly, may vary, and, dare I say it, understandably.'

Mr Menon later asked: 'Your negligence caused disaster and the deaths of 96 Liverpool fans, didn't it?'

Mr Duckenfield replied: 'I would not use the word negligence. Mistake, oversight. Sir, I did not foresee the consequence.'

Mr Menon said that the former officer's failure to close the tunnel before opening the gates was a, 'blunder of the first magnitude.'

Mr Duckenfield said, 'I can't deny it,' adding: 'I'm not making excuses, I have nothing to cover up, I have put my hands up and admitted my failings and I will continue to do so.'

The officer told jurors he 'came clean' about giving the order to open the gate at about 4pm after returning to the control box from a visit to Hillsborough's boardroom.

Whilst in the boardroom - in the presence of directors from Sheffield Wednesday, Nottingham Forest and Liverpool - Mr Duckenfield again failed to mention that he had authorised the gate to be opened.

After leaving the ground and travelling to South Yorkshire Police headquarters on the evening of April 15, Mr Duckenfield said he was summoned to brief Chief Constable Peter Wright.

Mr Menon asked Mr Duckenfield how the chief constable had reacted when he was informed that the head of the FA had been lied to.

Mr Duckenfield said: 'Sir, I think the best answer to that is that he was very unhappy overall. I remember walking into his office.

'He was sat behind his desk and he wasn't best pleased about the events. I just remember having related my story to him and being dismissed like a schoolboy out of the headmaster's office.'

Asked about the testimony he gave to the initial Taylor Inquiry into the disaster, a few months after the match, Mr Duckenfield said he 'should not have been giving evidence' because he was traumatised.

He also suggested that post-traumatic stress disorder had affected his memory of events.

The hearing continues tomorrow.
