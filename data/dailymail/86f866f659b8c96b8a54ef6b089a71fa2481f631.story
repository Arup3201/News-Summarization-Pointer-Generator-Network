DNA tests have confirmed a prominent Al-Qaeda leader was killed by French and Chadian troops in northern Mali, the French President confirmed today.

Abdelhamid Abou Zeid, senior commander in Al-Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb (AQIM), was killed among 40 other Islamist fighters last month in the foothills of the Adrar des Ifoghas mountains.

In a statement the office of French 
president Francois Hollande said the death was 'definitively confirmed' 
and that Abou Zeid's death 'marks an important step in the fight against
terrorism in the Sahel'.

Serious blow: Abou Zeid, one of the leaders of Al-Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb (AQIM), was killed by French and Chadian troops in the mountains in northern Mali

Chad's president had said earlier this month that Chadian troops had 
killed Abou Zeid while fighting to dislodge an al-Qaida affiliate in 
northern Mali.

French officials have maintained for weeks that Abou Zeid
was 'probably' dead but waited to conduct DNA tests to verify.

Abdelhamid Abou Zeid, thought to be 47, was a pillar of the southern 
realm of al Qaida in the Islamic Maghreb, or AQIM, responsible for the 
death of at least two European hostages and a leader of the extremist 
takeover of northern Mali.

He was killed in operations in the Adrar des Ifoghas mountains in 
northern Mali in late February, the statement from Hollande's office 
said.

The French military moved into Mali on January 11 to push back militants
linked to Abou Zeid and other extremist groups who had imposed harsh 
Islamic rule and who are seen as an international terrorist threat.

Abou Zeid led one of the most violent brigades of al Qaida's North 
African franchise. He was believed to be holding four French nationals 
kidnapped two years ago at a uranium mine in Niger. The fate of those 
hostages, working for French company Areva, was unclear.

Alleged murder: Abou Zeid is said to have been the one to execute British hostage Edwin Dyer in 2009

Abou Zeid held a Frenchman released in February 2010, and another who 
was executed that July. He's also been linked to the execution of a 
British hostage in 2009.

A powerful and shadowy figure, mystery surrounds even his real name. 
Along with his nom de guerre, Abou Zeid had an alias, Mosab 
Abdelouadoud, and nicknames, the emir of the south and the little emir, 
due to his diminutive size.

But the Algerian press has raised questions 
about his legal identity - Abid Hamadou or Mohamed Ghedir.

He was viewed as a disciplined radical with close ties to the overall 
AQIM boss, Abdelmalek Droukdel, who oversees operations from his post in
northern Algeria.

Abou Zeid fought with a succession of Islamist insurgency movements 
trying to topple the Algerian state since 1992. He reportedly joined the
brutal, and now defunct, Armed Islamic Group that massacred whole 
villages in northern Algeria, then joined the Salafist Group for Call 
and Combat that morphed into al Qaida in the Islamic Maghreb in 2006.

An Algerian court tried him in absentia in January 2012, convicting him 
of belonging to an international terrorist group and sentencing him to 
life in prison.

After a loose alliance of Islamist 
groups seized northern Mali from April last year, Abou Zeid took control
of the ancient desert trading town of Timbuktu, employing a violently 
extreme form of sharia, including amputations and the destruction of 
ancient Sufi shrines.

Timbuktu
elders who dealt directly with him during the Islamist occupation 
described a short man with a grey beard and a quiet, severe manner who 
was never seen without an AK-47 rifle.

Locals
said that when he fled Timbuktu, before the town fell to the French-led
military advance, he took several blindfolded Western hostages in his 
convoy.

Born in 1965 in the Debdab region of Algeria's Illizi province, close to the Libyan border, Abou Zeid joined the Salafist Group for Preaching and Combat (GSPC) during the 1990s civil war, which later transformed itself into AQIM.

Abou Zeid is regarded by some as one of AQIM's radicals, unwilling to negotiate or make concessions.

Canadian diplomat Robert Fowler, in an 
account of his kidnapping by another Islamist cell in the Sahara, 
recounted how Abou Zeid refused to give medication to two hostages 
suffering from dysentery, one of whom had been stung by a scorpion.

Abou Zeid is reported to have a strong rivalry with Mokhtar Belmokhtar, the mastermind of the mass hostage taking at the In Amenas gas plant in Algeria last month, due to the latter's decision to found his own brigade last year.Â
