Deborah Bay, a photographer from Texas recorded the grisly, dazzling effect of a bullet strike on plexiglass

Ms Bay said the photos made her think about the grisly effect that bullets can have if they hit muscle and bone.

'It's difficult to look at the images without giving some thought to what happens when bullets hit muscle and bone,' she said

'As I was researching this topic, I found it very difficult to read ballistics studies about a bullet's stopping power without having a pit in my stomach.

'There's a dissonance in the images as the eye is seduced by the imagery, while the brain is processing the potential for horror.'

'It was incredibly nerve-wracking to hear the gunfire all around, and it also was quickly apparent that I had no aptitude for hitting the target, so I knew someone else would have to do the firing,' she said.

'Anytime you're handling weapons, there is always the possibility of a ricochet or an accidental discharge. I was glad to be able to work with professionals who are experts at handling firearms.'

The photographer said the images have made her think about the impact of gun culture in her home state of Texas.

She said: 'I started thinking about the pervasiveness of guns as cultural symbols, and their enduring role as part of the American heritage.

'This seems particularly relevant in Texas, where I live. There are an estimated 51 million firearms - two guns for every man, woman and child in the state.'

A bullet will destroy or damage any tissues which it penetrates, creating a wound channel.

It will also cause nearby tissue to stretch and expand as it passes through tissue, causing a permanent cavity.
