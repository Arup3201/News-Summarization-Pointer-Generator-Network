He’s had the fanfare welcome now for the future. Sportsmail looks at what awaits Martin Odegaard after his first day of training as a Real Madrid player on Friday....

1. The dream team team-mates

Real Madrid are building a youth side that will take them to 2020 and beyond. 

Norwegian wonderkid Martin Odegaard has completed a £2.3million move to Real Madrid

Odegaard admitted the chance of working under Zinedine Zidane influenced his decision to join Real

Los Blancos are planning a 2020 dream team with the likes of Marcus Asensio and Scotland's Jack Harper

They signed Marcus Asensio from Mallorca last year beating Barcelona to the punch. They have Scoltand’s finest Jack Harper scoring goals for them in the Uefa Youth League. 

And they have Zinedine Zidane leading the B-team with the idea that he could do as Pep Guardiola did before him and become first team coach eventually replacing Ancelotti and then training the same players for the senior team.

2. Daddy’s home

Odegaard comes with his father Erik who has taken a coaching job at the club.

Having a father close by does not always help a player’s development. Bojan had his father with him at Barcelona but Pep Guardiola never took too kindly to what he felt was pressure from Bojan senior to speed his kid's progress and it played its part in the player having to leave the club to further his career.

3. Dedication

He has already picked out Cristiano Ronaldo as his role model. 

The Ronaldoesque dedication will not be problem because according to his father Eric he has trained 20-hours a week since the age of seven.

4. Nerve

If he does get to make his full debut sooner rather than later then he’ll be able to handle the pressure. He was given his full Norweigan league debut by current Celtic manager Ronny Deila just 15.

5. Friends in high places

Iker Casillas was called out of school aged 16 and told to report to the headmaster's office where he was then given the news that Real Madrid wanted him to join the squad for the Champions League trip to Rosenborg. 

He went to Norway aged 16 as Real's third keeper, Martin has made the journey the other way at the same age – they should have plenty to discuss when he trains with the first team.

Legend goalkeeper Iker Casillas also arrived at Real Madrid as a 16-year-old

6. Fans favourite

He should have no problem becoming a fan with the club’s supporters known as Vikings because, to quote the fans themselves: ‘We’ve always lauded it over Europe’.

7. Role model

He might want to follow the likes of Gareth Bale and Ronaldo but the last great Scandinavian through the doors at the Bernabeu was Thomas Gravesen. 

The midfielder they signed from Everton might not have won anything in his time in Spain but he is now living the life in Las Vegas.

8. Loan star

If Real do have to loan him out to get him game time it wont be the end of the world. 

Dani Carvajal went to Bayer Leverkusen when Jose Mourinho felt he was too raw for La Liga. After one great season he returned and is now first choice for club and country.
