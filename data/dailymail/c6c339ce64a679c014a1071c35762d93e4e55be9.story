Coronation Street star Chris Fountain has been axed from the show after video clips of him rapping about rape and violence while disguised in a Halloween mask emerged online.

The 25-year-old actor and former Dancing on Ice contestant was suspended from the show last week after the videos - posted on YouTube under the name of his rap alter-ego The Phantom - came to light.

Last night ITV confirmed that the actor had been sacked from the soap, stating: 'Chris Fountain's contract with ITV has been terminated as a result of the unacceptable comments he made in a number of online clips.'

Axed: Coronation Street actor Chris Fountain has been sacked by ITV after he was unmasked as controversial YouTube rapper The Phantom 

'Mortified' Fountain has issued an apology and said he is 'deeply ashamed' of the YouTube videos, which show the actor spouting lyrics about raping women, bombing houses and stabbing people in the face with syringes.

In one distasteful clip, he raps 
about dragging a girl upstairs, adding: ‘I will **** anybody up in the
worst way, rape a b***h on her birthday.’

The actor has said the explicit lyrics were 'blurted out in a moment of madness'.

He said in a statement: 'I would like to 
sincerely apologise for any offence I have caused. I am deeply ashamed 
by the lyrics and very much regret my behaviour.

'The videos were made 
over a year ago when I was experimenting with music and I’ve not done 
anything like it since and nor will I,' said the actor, who said he accepted ITV had 'no choice' but to end his contract.

Show bosses have decided not to edit 
Chris out of episodes he has already filmed so his character,  mechanic Tommy Duckworth, will appear on TV this week.

Over the weekend Coronation Street bosses reportedly urged Fountain to speak out on a television show such as Daybreak or This Morning in a bid to appease fans.

'The lyrics that appeared online were influenced by a style of hiphop that I was experimenting with at a private freestyle session and blurted out in a moment of madness.

There is absolutely no excuse - I take complete responsibility for my actions - but they were in no way thought out or represent at all my attitude towards women, rape and violence.

I just want to apologise from the bottom of my heart to everyone who I have offended or upset.

I completely understand that ITV had no choice but to terminate my contract today.

I have had two wonderful years playing Tommy Duckworth with only happy memories of my time on Coronation Street.

I am mortified that I have brought so much embarrassment to my colleagues and employers these last few days.

My biggest regret however is not to do with losing my job, but that I have hurt and let down so many people including those in a vulnerable situation and I am so very deeply ashamed of this.

I am also mortified to have put my mother, grandad and girlfriend through the last few days which they are hurt and bewildered by and so do not deserve. I am so sorry. Once again to everyone who I have let down and hurt. I am deeply sorry.'

A source told the Sunday Mirror: 'These videos are disgusting and bosses now need to work out exactly how to handle the situation.

'But while they are furious, they need to make sure his future is dealt with fairly... He is hoping the fact that they are suggesting he might go on TV to make a grovelling apology is a sign that they could see a future for him.'

The source suggested Fountain could appear on several TV shows in order to ensure his apology reached the broadest audience possible, or possibly hold a press conference about the scandal.

But the broadcaster confirmed last night that there was no longer a place for Fountain at Coronation Street.

In one of the shocking video clips the actor performs a 
stabbing action while he raps: ‘I’m a nasty ****, I will punch you in 
the face and you look like you’ve been having some acupuncture ’cos my 
fist is lethal.

‘I’m a ******* hero, you’ve got ******* zero. I’m a mother******* demon, I’ll stab you in the face with a needle.’

Fountain,
who finished runner-up in the third series of celebrity skating show 
Dancing On Ice in 2008, also raps about being fed up with fame as he 
lounges on a sofa with local rap group the West Yorkshire Cypher.

‘****
with me and you don’t want to risk it, I’ll play you like a board game.
I’m bored of fame so I’m taking the rap game, remember the name, it’s 
******* Phantom,’ he raps.

Last
night a spokesman for support service Rape Crisis said: ‘This is yet 
another shocking example of the hatred directed towards women by some 
men.

‘To dignify this with 
the name “music” does music an injustice, but the far greater injustice 
is that our young people are subjected to lyrics which encourage sexual 
violence against women.

‘If 
these violent and hate-filled lyrics were directed against other groups 
in society, they would be counted as incitement to violence and treated 
as a crime.’

Faye Maxted, 
chief executive of The Survivors Trust, said: ‘He is a high-profile 
character. It shows a complete lack of any kind of respect for women at 
all.’ 

Fountain has insisted the controversial lyrics 'in no way' represent his attitude towards women, rape or violence.

Coronation Street producers immediately suspended him from the show, in which he has played mechanic Tommy Duckworth since 2011, when news of his rap alter-ego broke.

An
ITV spokesman said when the videos first emerged: ‘ITV finds the language used and the views 
expressed in this video totally unacceptable. Chris Fountain has been 
suspended pending further inquiries into this matter.’

The
former Hollyoaks star has changed his YouTube privacy settings to try 
to ensure the series of five videos – already seen by thousands – can no longer be
viewed.

However, other versions had been uploaded yesterday, meaning they were still widely available for viewing.

An
official Twitter account belonging to The Phantom, which reportedly 
contained a tweet in which he boasts about killing a rap rival, has also
been hastily removed.

But there were still pictures of the actor on the West Yorkshire Cypher 
website yesterday, among images of members of the group smoking what 
appear to be cannabis spliffs.

Soap star: Fountain got his big break when he was cast as teen tearaway Justin Burton in Hollyoaks

Fountain first rose to fame as Justin Burton in Channel 4 teen drama Hollyoaks, before taking part in Dancing On Ice.

In
Coronation Street this year his character featured in a prominent 
storyline when his on-screen girlfriend became a surrogate mother in 
order to pay her debts.
