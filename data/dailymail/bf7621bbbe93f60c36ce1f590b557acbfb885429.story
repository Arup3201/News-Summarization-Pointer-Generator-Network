The Australian Open is in full swing with home-grown talent getting off to a great start but it’s not just the game that everyone’s eyes have been fixed on – the fluorescent fashion is simply unavoidable.

The world’s top players are making the most of the tournament’s relaxed dress regulations and donning bright yellow, greens, oranges, pinks and purples on the court as the year’s first grand slam gets under way.

When playing at Wimbledon  players are required to wear all-white, a rule that was initially introduced in 1890 and updated in 1995 to clarify that players must wear ‘almost entirely white’ but are allowed a coloured trim of 1cm width. But at the Australian Open pros can ‘express themselves’ in any colour they - or their sponsors - choose.

Rules simply stipulate that players can only have two commercial logos on their clothing which must be 'clean and customarily acceptable tennis attire'.

Pros view the fun summer tournament as a chance to stand out on the court. But are they also donning the brightest colours as some kind of distraction technique against their opponents? Or are they purely making fashion statements?

Roger Rasheed, a former Australian tennis player turned coach,  ruled out the colours had anything to do with stunning opponents. He told Daily Mail Australia ‘coaches don’t get involved’ in what players wear.

Meanwhile, former model and fashion expert Kate Peck said the stars ‘look great’ and their outfits are all about ‘adding another dimension to the game’.

‘It’s hard to be in a bad mood or get too serious when you are wearing outfits such as those, it’s a nice thing to have at the Australian Open to add some flair and fun and that vibe in such a serious environment,’ Peck told Daily Mail Australia.

Spanish player Rafeal Nadal dazzled in a bright pink t-shirt and fluoro yellow sweatbands when he won his first match at a Grand Slam since Wimbledon following injury and illness on Monday.

While Swiss star Roger Federer stood out in a high-vis t-shirt, along with Andy Murray in a fetching lime green top.

But the prize for the brightest outfit of all went to Australia’s rising star Thanasi Kokkinaki who sealed an astonishing win against the world’s No.13 Latvian Ernests Gulbis while wearing eye-popping, head- to-toe fluoro.

The 18-year-old from Adelaide, who is ranked 147th in the world, stunned the crowd and served his way out of an early exit of the tennis tournament in a pink and yellow outfit.

Peck advised that while neon colours are on trend in sports fashion at the moment, ‘too much colour blocking can be a little heavy on the eye… but some of their details and patterns are pretty cool.’

Fellow Aussie star Nick Kyrgios wore a fluoro yellow and white kit at Melbourne Park on Monday, as he beat off his opponent, Argentina's Federico Delbonis in a gruelling five-set test that lasted three hours and eight minutes. 

And it wasn’t just the men who illuminated the courts, Lucie Hradecka of the Czech Republic and Croatia's Petra Martic stood out in pink, while Eugenie Bouchard of Canada also added a touch of yellow to a very bold but feminine outfit.

Russia's Maria Sharapova – always one to lead the way in the tennis fashion stakes – opted for a slightly more subtle burnt orange dress and sun visor on the first day of the Australian Open.

‘Sharapova was my favourite design definitely. It’s wearable not just for tennis players and not too intimidating for a normal person,’ Peck said.

Celeb stylist and style expert Kai Aiyub added that the clothes they are wearing are ‘very full on fashion wise’.

‘With all these bright colours, I think players are trying to be bold and… it’s a great brand extension for them.

‘Depending on their skin tone, I think it all comes down to white being pretty boring and a very neutral colour. There’s not much you can do to stand out with it,’ Aiyub said.

‘The bright yellow makes you feel good and is quite pleasing to watch in general…Good on the guys for doing it too – Aussies have finally embraced fashion in sport,’ he added.
