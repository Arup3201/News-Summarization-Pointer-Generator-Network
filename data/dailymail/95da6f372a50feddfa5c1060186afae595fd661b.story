Michael Gove called him stupid for suggesting pupils needn’t bother at school.

Now Simon Cowell has thrown the same insult back at the Education Secretary, claiming he failed to see he was making a ‘positive’ statement about giving people without qualifications a chance.

The music mogul said his shows such as X Factor demonstrate that you can be successful without getting good grades or going to university, and called Mr Gove’s response ‘unbelievable’.

He said: ‘He didn’t bother to call, he didn’t want to hear my side of the story and, stupidly, he didn’t see the positive side of what I was trying to say which is that not everybody who leaves school is going to get great qualifications, or maybe they just don’t have that kind of brain.

‘But, that doesn’t mean that they should be ruled out, or not given a chance... so, if anything, I thought he was irresponsible, because he was basically saying, if you’re not qualified we’re not going to back you, and it’s like, how crazy are you for saying that?’

The row began last month when Cowell, 54, who is worth more than £200million from his record labels and hit shows such as X Factor, said he was ‘useless’ at school but claimed it did not matter.

He attended private Dover College in Kent and then Windsor Technical College and reportedly left with two ‘O’ Levels.

His father helped him find a post in the mail room at the record company EMI, where he went on to sign successful bands such as Five and Westlife before launching the X factor in 2004 with his own production company SyCo.

In an interview with a US radio station he said: ‘I didn’t work hard when I was at school. I left at 16 and I didn’t have any qualifications. I was useless. The secret is to be useless at school and then get lucky.’

The Education Secretary responded angrily, saying Cowell should use his fame to champion hard work at school ‘not rubbish it’. He said: ‘This is an irresponsible and stupid thing to say.

‘Teachers strive every day to ensure children understand the importance of learning, hard work and discipline. Simon Cowell’s comments undermine their efforts.

‘The truth is that only a tiny fraction of people get lucky. For everybody else, it’s all about hard work and that starts with hard work at school. Celebrities like Mr Cowell should encourage education, not rubbish it.’

Programmes such as X Factor and Britain’s Got Talent have been attacked by politicians for leading a generation of children to believe fame and fortune comes easily.

But Cowell, who is shortly expecting his first child with girlfriend Lauren Silverman, said yesterday that he had been ‘kidding around’ and ‘not trying to make some kind of political statement.’

Speaking on London radio station LBC 97.3, he added: ‘I don’t run a company where I hire people based on their qualifications, or have they gone to university. We hire people from the age of 16 up, 17, whatever it is, who want to work hard and want to make a career for themselves.’

He added: ‘Look, I never made these shows to make statements, but I think the one thing I can say about shows like the X Factor and Got Talent, is that even though people knock them, it is actually giving people a shot who’ve had doors slammed in their faces.

‘And, Susan Boyle I think is a good example of that. I mean the idea that Susan Boyle at 47 could have got a record deal, the odds would have been 10billion-to-one she wouldn’t. So, the show was the only platform for her, and she’s gone on to sell something like 30million records.

Education Secretary Michael Gove

‘I’ve always been someone who slightly backs the underdog a little bit, that goes back to that point I just made about qualifications, and on the show, I kind of like those moments when someone like that gets supported by the public and goes on to do well.’

Tory MP Chris Skidmore, a member of the Commons Education Select Committee, said after Cowell’s original comments: ‘For every Simon Cowell and brilliant entrepreneur like Richard Branson who leave school without qualifications, there are hundreds or thousands of young people who are not achieving good English and Maths GSCEs who are condemning themselves to a life of low aspirations and low wages.

‘X Factor has already sent the wrong message to many young people that it is all too easy to get rich quick on the back of couple of hours’ worth of performance.

‘The reality of life is that careers take years of graft and that includes having a strong education, particularly for those from deprived backgrounds.’
