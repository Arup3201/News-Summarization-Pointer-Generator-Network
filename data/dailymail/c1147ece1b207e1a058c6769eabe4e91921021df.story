The parents of a dying baby girl watched in anguish as a doctor broke off from trying to resuscitate her to answer his phone.

As 33-day-old Isabellina fought for life, consultant Dr Nigel Kennea took the call about another patient and left the baby in the care of a nurse.

Isabellina, who was born prematurely and had developed severe complications, died a few minutes later.

Fighter: Joanna Brewerton cuddles her baby daughter Isabellina at eight days old. Isabellina arrived 13 weeks prematurely at East Surrey Hospital on September 28 last year. Weighing just 2lb 2oz, she was transferred to the neonatal unit at St George’s Hospital in south London

Yesterday her grief-stricken parents described their shock at seeing the neonatologist answer his phone during the desperate battle to save their baby.

Mother Joanna Brewerton, a marketing executive, said: ‘We were standing there watching in panic and horror as our daughter’s life ebbed away. It is a moment so awful it is hard to describe.

‘Then his phone went. It wasn’t ringing, it was vibrating. It was buzzing in his pocket for quite a long time and then he pulled it out and was looking at it while it was still buzzing. He turned to the nurse and said, “Oh, I’ve got to take this”.

‘And he did. He put down the “tom thumb” [a device used to help resuscitate babies]. He was the only doctor in the room and he turned his back. He walked to the back of the room.’

Dr Kennea has apologised to the couple for being insensitive, and the hospital said the phone call he took was ‘vital’ to save the life of another baby under his care.

Isabellina arrived 13 weeks prematurely at East Surrey Hospital on September 28 last year. Weighing just 2lb 2oz, she was transferred to the neonatal unit at St George’s Hospital in South London.

Miss Brewerton and her partner, accountant Kevin Bennett, both 43 and from Bexhill-on-Sea, East Sussex, kept a cot-side vigil. But their baby, whose heart was no bigger than a five pence piece, developed a condition called necrotising enterocolitis and suddenly deteriorated on October 30.

Medical staff tried to save her for more than an hour, before Dr Kennea’s phone rang. Isabellina died soon afterwards, having suffered multiple organ failure.

Later the couple, who have two other children, Isaias, five, and two-year-old Isadora, held a meeting with a panel of doctors including Dr Kennea.

Miss Brewerton said: ‘He initially did not remember taking the phone call. He went white as soon as I accused him of it.

A St George’s Healthcare NHS Trust spokesman said: 'Staff are permitted to take urgent patient-related calls whilst treating other patients'

‘He swiped through the calls on his phone and said, “Oh, I did take a call”. I just lost it. I kept saying the same thing, “Who was more important than my daughter’s life?” and “Why could you not have handed that phone to another member of staff?”

‘I badgered him. He apologised and then he couldn’t stop apologising and he was still apologising as we left the room.’

The hospital carried out an investigation and concluded that the taking of the phone call ‘would not have made any difference’ to Isabellina’s death.

Dr Andy Rhodes, who chaired the inquiry, said: ‘Dr Kennea was coordinating the care of many sick patients that night and thus having clear lines of communication were of the utmost priority.

‘By the time Dr Kennea took the phone call, the severity of her condition was so poor that Isabellina was not going to survive. Dr Kennea was not alone in the room that night and handed over the ongoing resuscitation to other appropriately skilled and competent members of staff.’

In a letter to Isabellina’s family, hospital chief executive Miles Scott wrote: ‘The panel considered this carefully and concluded it had no bearing on her death. However they fully recognise it appeared insensitive and gave the wrong impression ... an impression that upset you both greatly, and for which Dr Kennea has offered his sincere apologies.’

Cambridge-educated Dr Kennea is a renowned neonatal specialist whose research has won him awards. 

In a statement to the Mail, Mr Scott added: ‘Dr Kennea and his team did all they could for Isabellina. We repeat our sympathies to her family and are continuing our dialogue.’

A St George’s Healthcare NHS Trust spokesman said: ‘Staff are permitted to take urgent patient-related calls whilst treating other patients.

‘In the case of Baby I [Isabellina], one of the medical team treating her took such a call from another doctor about the urgent care of another sick baby. It was brief and, as an independent expert review has concluded, taking the call had no bearing on the outcome.’
