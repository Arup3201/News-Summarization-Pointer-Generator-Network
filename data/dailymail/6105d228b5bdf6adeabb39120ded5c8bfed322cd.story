Chris Christie today announced he will not run for president - despite huge Republican support.

The 49-year-old New Jersey Governor confirmed his decision at a press conference today, after weeks of speculation that he might reverse his long-held stance of staying out of the 2012 race.

'This is not the time to leave unfinished business,' Governor Christie said. 'The stakes are too high. New Jersey - whether you like it or not, you're stuck with me'.

Not running: New Jersey Governor Chris Christie confirmed his decision at a press conference today, after weeks of speculation that he might reverse his long-held stance of staying out of the 2012 race

His decision will prompt a sigh of 
relief from GOP presidential frontrunners Texas Governor Rick Perry and 
former Massachusetts Governor Mitt Romney, as well as President Barack 
Obama.

'Over the last few weeks I've thought long and hard about this decision,' he said. 'I’ve explored the options and listened to so many people... but now is not my time.'

Governor Christie said he is proud of all he has accomplished in New Jersey, but there is 'plenty more to do' and he is 'not prepared to walk away'. 'It just didn't feel right to me to leave,' he added.

However he took the chance as the nation watched his speech to hit out at Barack Obama, saying the President has 'failed the leadership test' and that 'there's no substitute for knowing how to lead'.

Many Republican donors, fans and luminaries are unhappy with the current crop of contenders to challenge President Obama and saw Governor Christie as the strongest challenge they had.

But Governor Christie’s decision to stay out of the race means that three months before voting is set to begin, the Republican race remains focused on Mr Romney and Governor Perry.

His decision was finally confirmed at 
the New Jersey statehouse on Tuesday afternoon, but it was revealed 
beforehand by sources who spoke anonymously to avoid pre-empting his 
announcement.

Governor 
Christie, the famously blunt, budget-cutting governor in office not even
two years, had spent the past few days reconsidering his long-time 
refusals to run for the presidential nomination.

He stoked the speculation with a high-profile speech last week at the Ronald Reagan presidential library in Simi Valley, California, where he reiterated that he wasn't running for president.

He also held a tour to help raise money for Republicans in Missouri, California and Louisiana.

Encouragement from high-profile figures such as Henry Kissinger, Nancy Reagan and Barbara Bush led him to reconsider a bid and he spent the weekend thinking over his options.

Governor Christie's announcement comes 
as a new poll shows Governor Perry's support dropping and businessman 
Herman Cain rising following a much-praised debate performance.

The Washington Post-ABC survey shows Mr Romney regaining the lead, though his support remains in the same place it's been for months - the mid-20s.

The push for new candidates and the quick rise and fall of others such as Donald Trump, who also flirted with a presidential bid, reflect continued discomfort in the GOP with Mr Romney.

The former Massachusetts Governor has been steadily campaigning since he lost in the 2008 primary but hasn't been able to sway sceptical conservatives who make up the party base.

'With the field clarified and the two front-runners either frozen or sinking, Herman Cain has a unique opportunity that six months ago, no pundit, professional or politician would have given him.'Douglas Schoen, Fox News

'Christie’s decision not to run for the Republican presidential nomination is hardly a surprise. That a few dreamers thought his candidacy a possibility at all says more about their dissatisfaction with the current field of candidates than anything else.'Konrad Yakabuski, Globe and Mail

'Christie would have been a potent fundraiser with strong support on Wall Street. His potential candidacy had complicated the money-raising efforts of both Romney and Perry. Now that he’s decided, the other candidates will redouble their efforts.'Richard Dunham, Houston Chronicle

'Christie's decision not to run for president almost certainly means that the 2012 Republican presidential field is set, news that some donors and party activists may greet grimly.'Chris Cillizza, Washington Post
