American Pike, The Codfather and The Prawn Identity.

These are just a few of the films which have been given a ‘fishy’ makeover by one creative design company.

London-based Fishfinger has taken dozens of well-known film posters and created brilliant mock-ups of how they may have looked had the film focused a bit more on seafood and a bit less on A-list actors.

From the likes of The Prawn Identity and Eel-T, to Jurassic Carp and Forrest Guppy, the designers have trawled through some of their favourite movies to come up with their own take.

All of the original Hollywood posters have been made-over to include at least one type of fish whether it be cod, hake, pike, ling or prawns.

Fishfinger's creative director Jeff Salmon, who is also the star of Channel 4's Four Rooms, said he set his team the quirky task after being inspired by watching A Fish Called Wanda.

He said: ‘Quite simply, fish puns are Cod's gift to the British language. There is probably no better topic in our dictionary for word-play lovers - because you can have some Eel fun with them.

‘Not long ago I was sat on the beach in Barbados watching the tropical flying fish. Having just watched the classic movie A Fish Called Wanda on the plane over, and being a huge cinema fan, my mind started going.

‘So we set our loyal school of Fishfingerettes on Facebook and Twitter a challenge to come up with as many fishy film titles as they could.

‘And, after receiving such a Skate response, we decided to turn them into film posters - just for the Halibut, really.’
