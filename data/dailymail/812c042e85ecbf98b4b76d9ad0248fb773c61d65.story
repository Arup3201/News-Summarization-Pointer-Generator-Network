Forget Twiglets or cheese and pineapple on a stick, the oyster is fast becoming the party food of choice for hosts who want to surprise and indulge their guests.

Waitrose is reporting a 78 per cent increase in sales of fresh oysters this December compared to a year ago, while it is also possible to buy them in tins or at budget chains like Lidl.

The slippery canapés are best served with chilled fizz, which is also seeing something of a boom as we approach the New Year’s Eve parties.

Waitrose has reported a 78 per cent increase in the sales of Oysters charging just 79 pence each

At one time, they were the exclusive preserve of the millionaire classes, however supermarkets are bringing them to the high street with Waitrose charging 79p each.

They are even cheaper at Lidl with a pack of six fresh Pacific oysters coming in at £2.49 – 42p each.

Oysters feature on the menus in some of the country’s finest restaurants, including Richard Corrigan’s, J Sheekey’s and the Soho stalwart Randall and Aubin, but they are now being incorporated into the festive season.

Sales of the shellfish at Christmas come only second to Valentine’s Day, where there claimed aphrodisiac qualities are the key selling point.

As well as being associated as a food of romance, oysters are also rich in minerals and vitamins, and a good source of Omega-3.

Oysters are something of an acquired taste, however they promise to give any party spread an impressive focal point if only because of the confusion about how best to eat them.

Traditionally, oysters have been seen as a luxury item found it in class restaurants such as celebrity chef Richard Corrigan's, pictured who is renowned for the quality of his shellfish

The cognoscenti seem to favour swallowing them down whole, while others favour chewing on them.

Waitrose buyer, Andy Boulton, said: ‘Some insist on swallowing oysters in one but oysters have a lovely texture and chewing them as you would a piece of meat releases the full flavour – but each to their own.

‘The juice from the shell complements their natural flavour and a touch of lemon juice or Tabasco can complete the experience.’

He added: ‘One of the most appealing things about oysters for festive entertaining is that they’re completely self-contained and self-serve which means they make the perfect starter or canapé.’

Reared and hand-picked in the clean waters of remote sea lochs on the west coast of Scotland, the oysters grow naturally by feeding from the nutrient-rich tidal flows of the clean seas around Scotland.

They reach maturity at three to three-and-a-half years when they are carefully harvested by hand from the growing trestles, each one individually checked for quality and then purified in holding tanks.
