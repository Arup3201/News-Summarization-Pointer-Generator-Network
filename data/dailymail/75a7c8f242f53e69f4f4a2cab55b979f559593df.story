Working hours cut: A report shows businesses will lose more and more staff who need to care for relatives with Alzheimer's

Thousands of people with dementia and their carers will be forced to give up their jobs, costing employers more than £3billion, warn campaigners.

There will be a mounting toll on business from all forms of dementia including Alzheimer’s as the number affected is set to rise to over one million in England by 2030.

A new report shows the cost of staff hours that will be lost due to caring for someone suffering from dementia, as well as the loss of skills and experience from the workforce.

It says there will be a huge impact on businesses as increasing numbers of workers are obliged to reduce hours, change work patterns or even quit their jobs due to the demands of caring.

The number of people leaving paid employment to care for people with dementia will rise from 50,000 in 2014 to 83,100 in 2030, says the report from the Centre for Economics and Business Research.

The cost of lost hours of workers with dementia forced to retire will go up from £628 million to reach £1.2 billion by 2030, it says.

This will be dwarfed by the £2.2billion cost of carers forced to quit, while £763 million will be lost by carers’ curtailing their hours.

Companies must adapt the working environment to help sufferers and their carers in order to minimise the financial burden, and provide support to their workforce, says the report.

For example, if companies used flexible working to increase their employment rate of dementia carers by just over two per cent   the retention of these skilled and experienced staff would deliver a saving of £415 million by 2030.

The report was released by Public Health England and Alzheimer’s Society, who recently joined forces to launch the Dementia Friends campaign which aims to support people with dementia and their carers.

It says businesses have started to recognise this issue, with one in 12 of 1,000 companies surveyed having made attempts to accommodate the needs of a member of staff with dementia.

More than half are considering taking such action in the future.

So far more than 20 major businesses are committed to supporting staff and customers with dementia.

Over 100,000 employees from businesses including LloydsPharmacy and M&S are now Dementia Friends, while other companies such as Barclays, Lloyds Banking Group, Argos, BT and Bourne Leisure (Butlins, Haven and Warner Leisure Hotels) have also pledged for their staff to become Dementia Friends.

The report says businesses that are not ‘dementia friendly’ will lose out because the spending power of households affected by dementia, is set to double to £22.7 billion by 2030, from £11 billion in 2014.

Growing problem: With an ageing population, the number of workers leaving to help family members with dementia will rise from the current 50,000 to 83,100 in 2030, the report reveals

Jeremy Hughes, Chief Executive of Alzheimer’s Society, said ‘Thousands of people affected by dementia are forced to give up work and are denied a lifeline because of the failure of organisations to change the way they do business.

‘From the shop floor to boardrooms, dementia affects every workplace; from people struggling with the early symptoms of memory loss at work, to those juggling a job whilst caring for a loved one.

‘As the condition touches the lives of more people, businesses must gear up to support all people with dementia; staff and customers alike.

‘With dementia affecting millions of people, businesses who ignore the dementia pound do so at their own peril.’

Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt said ‘Dementia is one of the biggest challenges we face, and our ambition is to become one of the best countries in the world for dementia care.

‘We can only do this with the help and support of every part of society.

‘It’s great that businesses, communities and individuals are showing such willingness to help and support those living with dementia – demonstrated by nearly 350,000 people who have already signed up to become Dementia Friends.’

Matt Hammerstein, Managing Director for Barclays, said ‘Barclays is committed to supporting vulnerable customers and we have the ambition to be the most accessible and inclusive bank for all customers and clients.

‘Becoming a dementia friendly company is something that we feel is important to support our colleagues, customers and wider society. It is also crucial to us as a business to help us make all our customers’ lives easier.

‘We urge other businesses to sign up and help make all those affected by dementia continue to feel valued.’
