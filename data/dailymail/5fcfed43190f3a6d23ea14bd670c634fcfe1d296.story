It's a competition run by radio stations the world over... calling in to win a cash prize - but you have to be a particular numbered caller in the line before you can play.

Three workers at a Canadian phone company thought they could beat the system as they developed a system to ensure they were guaranteed to be the 25th caller to C100's 'Beat the Bank' contest.

The competition airs on the Halifax radio station five times each weekday during which time successful callers push their luck with a chance of winning up to $50,000.

Contest: The competition allows specific callers to try and win money their time runs out

Ongoing: The competition runs several times throughout the morning as callers try their luck

Now, an internal investigation is underway at Bell Aliant to determine if they jumped ahead in C100’s call queue for its Beat the Bank contest.

Once the DJ announces that the contest is in progress C100 picks the 25th caller to compete live on-air.

Bell Aliant are not saying exactly what kind of technology was used to ensure they callers landed in the right place, but as the company also control the phone lines that the radio station uses, it wouldn't take a genius to come up with some sort of method.

Bell Aliant are also the sister company of Bell Media who own the C100 radio station.

Suspicions: Three workers at Bel Aliant have been suspended whist the radio station and phone company discover if there was any foul play

Theory: The suggestion is that somehow the workers at the phone company were able to secure their places in line on the radio station switchboard in order to qualify

Bell Aliant have released a statement regarding the issue:

'It was brought to our attention by concerned employees that three employees were jumping ahead in the call queue for the Beat the Bank Contest on C100.

We moved very quickly to alert C100 and to put a fix in place to avoid this happening for their contests in the future.'

The company said it is taking the issue very seriously and an internal investigation is underway.

Three employees – a man and two women –  have been suspended with pay and sent home.

The statement continued: 'We take a lot of pride in the integrity of our people and our network and we are thankful that our employees were concerned enough to bring this to our attention.'

'Once brought to our attention, our contest call-in system was reviewed immediately. We remain confident in the security of the system and can ensure our listeners 'Beat the Bank' and similar contests are completely fair for all,' said the radio station.

'We hold the integrity of our contests to the highest degree. As a result, we are withholding the final winnings of these individuals pending the outcome of the investigation by Bell Aliant.'

One of the employees is believed to have won $750 towards the end of August.

Conflict of interest: Both the radio station, C100 and the phone company, Bell Aliant are owned by the same telecommunications group
