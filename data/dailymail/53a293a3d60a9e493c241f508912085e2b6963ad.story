A wealthy former yacht dealer has snapped up every foreclosed home in Michigan's Macomb County, paying the cut price of $4.9million for a whopping 645 properties.

Bill McMachen handed over a measly $7,500 on average for each of the properties, of which 403 are family homes, and he's now being bombarded with emails from prospective buyers.

'It's overwhelming,' McMachen told the Detroit News after Tuesday's transaction. 'I'm having a hard time keeping up with them all.'

In an arrangement with the Macomb County, McMachen agreed to take all the foreclosed homes authorities didn't want off their hands in exchange for paying back all taxes owed.

'By packaging the good with the bad, it's in the center for somebody to come in and buy it all,' Macomb County Treasurer Ted Wahby told Fox 2 in Detroit.

McMachen expects to make $2million from his investment after fixing up the dilapidated properties.

But some investors were less happy about the mass-scale house-flogging deal.

Crunching numbers: Even after covering the $4.9million he spent purchasing all of the homes, Mr McMachen plans to make approximately $2million in profit by selling off the homes

Around 300 people waited hours at the auction but were turned away, having forked out $500 to register.

One would-be buyer told the TV station he was prepared to bid up the four times what McMachen actually paid for some of the homes.

'I feel bad that it went that way,' he said. 'If we knew it was going to happen like this we wouldn't have wasted any time.'

But Wahby said the county's job was to collect taxes, which is what they did.

'People who are going to buy five or ten houses weren't buying them because they wanted to move in,' he told Fox 2.

Angry investors: Would-be buyers were disappointed with the fire sale

'They wanted to make money on them, and God bless them, I wish they could have, but that's not my mission. I have a job to do. I have to collect the taxes, and that's what we did.'

McMachen and his investment partner plan to sell the homes, perhaps to the investors who missed out at auction.

'They can still buy the property from me, probably for about the same price they would have bought it at the auctions,' McMachen said.
