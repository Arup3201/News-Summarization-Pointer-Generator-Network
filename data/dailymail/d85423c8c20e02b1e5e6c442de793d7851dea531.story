Britain is 'a nation of porkers' eating themselves into an early grave, a leading diabetes expert has claimed.

Speaking on BBC Radio 5 live this morning, Professor Craig Currie from the Cardiff University said that Britons are refusing to take responsibility for their weight and the health consequences that go with it.

He said: 'Essentially we are nation of lazy 
porkers. At a very young age we are getting a disease which could lead 
to a number of very severe complications.

Fat Britain: Dr Craig Currie believes that despite knowing the risks, Britons are continuing to gain weight and refusing to take measures to prevent the complications

The Professor believes the number of people under 40 diagnosed with type 2 diabetes over the last 20 years has almost trebled.

'For every hundred cases 20 years ago there now would be 300 cases. In people under 40 years old for every 100 cases 20 years ago you'd get 600 cases.'

Dr Currie believes that despite knowing the risks, Britons are continuing to gain weight and refusing to take measures to prevent the resulting complications.

'You've got to have lived on Mars if you don't realise that being fat is going to cause you a few problems,' he said.

'There are things people won't discuss, such as if you're overweight your body won't work.'

'If you get diabetes at a young age you are going to get a lot of vascular problems, you'll be popping pills for a long time if you're not careful.'

It is possible to develop type 2 diabetes and not be obese, but says Dr Currie, 'the vast majority of people are what is called insulin resistant which develops because we are eating too much.

'The body's natural reaction is to defend itself to become insulin resistant and we become fatter and fatter.'

If you're obese when you're young, it can lead to severe complications later on, says Professor Craig Currie

'Normally when people get type 2 diabetes they are an older age and it can lead to large vessel disease, heart attacks, strokes and cancer.

'But when you have sugar problems for many years you get micro vascular complications: diseases of the eye, kidney and peripheral neuropathy, so essentially you can get renal failure and blindness.'

'People who are getting it much younger will have sugar problems for a much longer period, so are more likely to get these types of problems - and considerable premature mortality.'

'They're going to lose quite a few years off their life expectancy.'

The professor added that young people with type 2 diabetes are a heavy burden on the NHS.

'If you get diabetes, you cost a fortune. You're double or treble your average cost per year.

'You look at the US and a lot of Western countries and we're all just getting fatter and fatter.

'If you are a porker when you're young and you get diabetes, you're storing up bother.

'It seems so futile that we know about these things but we don't do anything about it.'

The number diagnosed with diabetes has risen by more than a third since 2006. One in 20 Britons now suffer from diabetes as a result of soaring obesity rates, a recent study found.

Nine
 out of ten people with diabetes have type 2, which occurs when the body
 gradually loses the ability to process blood sugar, which can damage 
the organs and lead to years of ill health.

It
 is strongly linked to lifestyle factors such as being overweight or 
obese, leading a sedentary lifestyle and eating an unhealthy diet.

Barbara
 Young, chief executive of Diabetes UK, said: â€˜We are hugely concerned 
that the number of people diagnosed with diabetes has reached three 
million for the first time and there is no reason to think this will 
mark the end of what has been a rapid rise.'
