Three teenagers were killed after their pickup truck crashed down an embankment in a remote canyon in California yesterday morning.

The teenagers from Burbank California died after their truck went over the side of the road near Sierra Highway and Rush Canyon Road in Santa Clarita  according to police.

An incident report named driver Ian Bulbenko along with two passengers Jake Gnasso and April Townshend as those who were killed.

Crash site: The teenagers from Burbank died after their truck went over the side of the road near Sierra Highway and Rush Canyon Road according to police

Rescue: A Los Angeles County Fire Department helicopter airlifted two of the teenagers to hospital after the fatal crash which claimed three lives

Two other passengers - Zachary Main and Timothy Gorman - survived the deadly crash and were airlifted from the scene.

Both were wearing seatbelts, according to police.

However, it was not clear if those killed were wearing seatbelts.

Police said the teenagers’ 2001 Chevrolet pickup truck had been traveling southbound.

It was found on its left side 200 feet down an embankment at the bottom of Rush Canyon in the Angeles National Forest.

Lt. Rob Hahnlein of the Los Angeles County Sheriff’s Department said that someone who had been riding in the truck called 911 at about 7:15 a.m. but it was unclear when the truck had crashed.

The California Highway Patrol said that preliminary findings suggest that the crash occurred around 2 a.m. But a 911 call was not received from an ‘injured and distressed’ survivor until about 7:35 a.m.

All of the teenagers in the truck were aged 19-years-old. 

All three of the teenagers who died were 2013 graduates of Burroughs High School in Burbank.

Hundreds of students from their high school paid tribute to them during a candlelight vigil on Friday evening.

‘I’m glad Tim and Zach are OK, but I’m really hurt because my friends that I grew up with are gone,' Michael Viaguez told KTLA 5.

Police have not confirmed whether alcohol or drugs played any part in the crash but an investigation will take place.

The crash comes almost a year after five graduates of Burbank and Burroughs high schools were killed in a crash near the 5 Freeway.
