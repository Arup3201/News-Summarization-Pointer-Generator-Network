Former Nottingham Forest striker Dougie Freedman has been named the club's new manager in place of Stuart Pearce who was sacked on Sunday night after a 1-0 home defeat against Millwall.

Freedman, 40, was the preferred candidate of Kuwaiti owner Fawaz Al Hasawi because of his experience of working in The Championship with clubs on limited budgets.

The pair held amicable discussions on Sunday night before Freedman was appointed on an 18-month contract.

Age: 40 (D.O.B. 25/05/1974)

Born: Glasgow, Scotland

Clubs managed: Crystal Palace (2011-12), Bolton Wanderers (2012-14)

Clubs played for: Barnet (1994-95), Crystal Palace (1995-97), Wolverhampton Wanderers (1997-98), Nottingham Forest (1998-2000), Leeds United (loan, 2008), Southend United (2008-2010)

Scotland caps: 2 

Pearce, a legendary Forest player under Brian Clough and a former England Under 21 and Manchester City manager, was sacked after seven months in charge following a run of three wins in 23 matches.

Scot Freedman built the Crystal Palace team that won promotion to the Premier League in 2012-13 but left midway through the season to join Bolton Wanderers.

With Bolton £170million in debt, he was unable to turn their fortunes around and was sacked  in October, nearly two years into the job and with the team 23rd in the table.

Importantly for Al Hasawi, both of Freedman's previous chairmen Steve Parrish of Crystal Palace and Phil Gartside at Bolton gave the Glaswegian excellent references as someone who cares about the future of the football club as well as the present.

Forest also face financial restrictions and are currently one of three Championship teams alongside Leeds United and Blackburn Rovers who are banned from buying players because of breaches of Financial Fairplay regulations.

Freedman also spent time as a player at Forest and represented the club alongside John Terry, who was a young loanee from Chelsea at the time.

In total he scored 23 goals in 83 appearances for the club between 1998 and 2000 spending his first season there in the Premier League.

Forest are now 12th in the Championship. Because of the transfer embargo, they are not allowed to sign players but have space in their squad for one more loan signing provided there is no loan fee attached.
