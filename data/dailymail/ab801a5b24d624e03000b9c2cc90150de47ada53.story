Chelsea have re-opened talks with Atletico Madrid over their move to sign Filipe Luis.

The left-back is viewed as a priority signing by boss Jose Mourinho but the Blues have so far been frustrated in their attempts to sign Luis.

Target: Filipe Luis impressed for Atletico last season and is keen to make the move to Chelsea

Almost: Luis, not picked in Brazil's World Cup squad, is closing in on a switch to Stamford Bridge

The 28-year-old has a release clause, understood to be in the region of £20million, that Chelsea have been reluctant to trigger.

But Stamford Bridge chiefs are back in talks with their Spanish counterparts with a view to concluding the protracted transfer in the coming days.

Strengthening at left-back is a major concern for Mourinho going into the new season.

Long-term left-back Ashley Cole has left the club for Roma after his contract expired.

Cole was kept out of the side last season by Cesar Azpilicueta, but the Spaniard is a right-back by trade.

On his way: the full-back could follow striker Diego Costa (above) to Stamford Bridge next season
