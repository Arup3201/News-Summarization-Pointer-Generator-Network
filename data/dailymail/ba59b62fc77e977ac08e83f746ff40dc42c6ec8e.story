Michael Clarke will take his place in the Australian line-up for the first cricket Test against India in Adelaide starting on Tuesday.

The confirmation came from bowling spearhead Mitchell Johnson that Clarke has overcome his hamstring injury and will lead the side in the opening match of the four Test series.

'He's a huge part and we're glad that he's back,' said Johnson.

So it's settled. Australia's captain Michael Clarke is cleared to play in the first cricket Test at Adelaide Oval beginning on Tuesday. He's pictured here with the chairman of selectors, Rod Marsh (l) and coach Darren Lehmann (r) 

It's been a stressful time for all involved with the Australian cricket team. Michael Clarke is pictured with team physio Alex Kountouris after a net session at Adelaide Oval on Monday which confirmed the skipper's availability for the first test of the summer

The shirt Michael Clarke is expected to wear on Tuesday when he leads Australia out against India. The whites worn by the Test team carry Phillip Hughes Test player number of 408 as a tribute to the late cricketer

Australia will also pay further tribute to the late Phillip Hughes.

He has been named as Australia's 13th man, the team will wear his Test number 408 on their shirts and there will be a ceremony to honour the fallen batsman prior to the first session.

Johnson says it's pivotal to Australia's hopes for success to have their skipper out on the field.

'He's a strong leader, he's been an aggressive leader, he's just grown as a capatain,' he added.

Michael Clarke delivers his emotional eulogy to his 'little brother' at Phillip Hughes' funeral last week. The skipper will take his place in the Australian line-up after overcoming injury

'To have him in the batting order as well, he's really keen to get out there and he just has something about him as a captain, everyone listens.

'He's a huge boost for us in our line-up and I really hope he can go out there and score a lot of runs for us.'
