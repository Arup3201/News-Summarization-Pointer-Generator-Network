The stunning ice caves of Iceland's Vatnajokull glacier appear in a kaleidoscope of colours as the light and conditions change in these remarkable photographs by local guide Einar Runar Sigurdsson.

About 200 British tourists annually brave the network of caves in Europe's largest glacier mass found in the south of Iceland where Einar runs tours for keen photographers throughout the winter, the only time visitors can go inside.

The ice takes on the form of giant teeth or huge waves trapped in suspended animation in the maze of interconnected frozen chambers and they can be a luminous blue or near fluorescent oranges and reds when a fire is lit inside or when the sun outside is rising or setting.

Sigurdsson shot these images on the south side of Vatnajokull glacier, which covers more than 8,100 square kilometres or more than eight per cent of Iceland and is estimated to have a volume of 3300 cubic km.

'In autumn each year we start looking for the ice caves for the winter,' he says on his company website. 'Normally we find caves in several different locations on the south side of Vatnajokull. Sometimes they are very special, sometimes not as special but become special in the right light and conditions.'  

Einar comes from a long line of Icelandic adventurers, with his grandfather Pall Jonsson in the first group to climb Iceland’s highest peak, Hvannadalshnukur, 1891 when he guided the Britain's Frederick Howell to the top.

His father, Sigurour Bjarnason, packed in sheep farming to give bird watching and history tours in Ingolfshofdi in 1991. Einar then began taking tours of his own to the peak of Hvannadalshnukur in 1994 and say his 275 ascents of the mountain is a record.

He now runs the ice cave tours with his wife Matta and son Aron through their company Local Guide of Vatnajokull, formerly known as From Coast To Mountains.

Einar says while it would seem the ice takes on the blue of the sky, it can in fact appear blue on cloudy day 

A fiery orange-red reflection illuminates the cave. 'The low advent sun that makes this crazy red light when it shines through the ice. I've only seen this this one time,' Einar says.

'Some caves we find are very stable and we can go in there in any weather, but others are less safe and we might not even go there at all, even if they are very beautiful.

'Some caves are only accessible in below zero conditions for example if there is water in the floor that needs to be frozen over to walk into the cave.'

While some glacial caves are created by geothermal springs, Einar says the caves on the south side of Vatnajokull 'simply form because in the summer the surface of the big glaciers meld due to warm weather and sun and the water falls into thousunds of mullions (sink holes) and finally come out of the glacier tongue as a river.'

He adds: 'When winter is cold enough we can enter many of those tunnels that formed the previous summer. When the sun is lower, the glacier doesn’t meld much and the tunnels are dry.'
