One senior colleague said Dominic Grieve was on a mission to be the 'most unpopular man in the world'

Cabinet ministers are plotting to oust Attorney General Dominic Grieve after a series of political blunders.

Senior government figures are furious at ‘ridiculous Europhile Grieve’ for his refusal to back colleagues in the battle to stop the European Court of Human Rights demanding Britain give prisoners the vote.

Downing Street was also dismayed this week when Mr Grieve took just 40 minutes to dismiss a call from Defence Secretary Philip Hammond for a review of the case of SAS solider Sgt Danny Nightingale, who was jailed for 18 months for keeping a souvenir Iraq pistol.

Mr Hammond let slip his fury, when he went on live TV and took a swipe at ‘tremendously pompous lawyers’.

Now it has emerged that ministers are so fed up they want Mr Grieve removed from his job.

One senior Cabinet minister said: ‘It’s high time we got rid of him - he never seems to be on our side.’

Another senior colleague said he was determined to make himself the 'most unpopular man in the world'.

Mr Grieve survived the last reshuffle, but his deputy Edward Garnier was sacked and replaced by Oliver Heald.

Some Tories believe Tory MP Mr Grieve could decide to quit on his own terms, after clashes with Cabinet colleagues.

Cabinet colleagues were dumbfounded this week when he moved quickly to pour cold water on efforts by Mr Hammond to help Sgt Nightingale's appeal against his jail sentence.

Mr Hammond wrote to Mr Grieve asking him to look at the case and see if Sgt Nightingale's prosecution had been in the public interest.

But barely 40 minutes after news of Mr Hammond's letter emerged, the Attorney General's office said it would be 'inappropriate' to intervene.

The rebuttal was especially embarrassing as Sgt Nightingale's wife Sally was due at Number 10 that afternoon to meet aides to David Cameron, after she wrote to the Prime Minister about the case.

Ministers are also furious that the 
Attorney General this week banned them from expressing a view on whether
prisoners should be able to take part in elections.

Mr Grieve said minister must abstain when the crucial vote takes place in the House of Commons next year.

The law officer has also ruled that the Government must not ‘take a position’ in the debate by expressing support for a ban.

Justice Secretary Chris Grayling told the Commons Britain could ignore fines from the European Court of Human Rights

Yesterday Justice Secretary Chris 
Grayling made clear in the Commons his opposition to the EHCR ruling 
that prisoners should have the vote.

He
repeatedly stressed that the UK Parliament is ‘sovereign’ and floated 
the prospect of Britain refusing to pay any fines which could be imposed
if the ruling is ignored.

'Ultimately if this Parliament decides not to agree to rulings from the ECHR it has no sanction,' Mr Grayling said.

'It can apply fines in absentia but it will be for Parliament to decide whether it wishes to recognise those decisions, as it is with all decisions.'

Mr Grayling replaced Ken Clarke as Justice Secretary, who was seen as too pro-European on criminal justice matters.

But colleagues now think Mr Grieve is a road block to taking a tougher line on law and order.

‘He seems to be trying to make himself the most unpopular man in the world, filling a niche previously occupied by Kenneth Clarke,’ said one.

However, allies insist he is just fulfilling his role as the government's chief lawyer.

'He has a lot of support and respect on the Conservative benches,' said a friend.
