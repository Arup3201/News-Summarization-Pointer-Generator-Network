The government's planning reforms have spectacularly failed to stimulate a new wave of house building across the country.

Figures showed that the number of new homes started last year in England was a massive 11 per cent lower than the year before - exacerbating the chronic shortages at a time when the population is on the rise.

Work was started on just 98,280 properties in 2012 - one of the lowest totals in recent years and less than half of the country's estimated need.

Declining: the number of new builds is declining despite government efforts to boost the industry

The disappointing figures come despite former planning minister Grant Shapps' high-profile reforms to free up public land for building, to enable communities to identify parcels of land for building, and to help people get a foot on the housing ladder through new state-backed mortgage schemes.

Last night Jack Dromey, Labour's housing spokesman, said thousands of young people would be denied the chance to own their own home unless more houses were built.

'David Cameron's failed housing policies are making the biggest housing crisis in a generation worse, not better,' he said.

'Nearly 18 months on from David Cameron's promise to "get Britain building", it's clear he is failing.

'We started to build 11 per cent fewer homes in 2012 than the previous year, less than 100,000 homes in the whole of England and only two fifths of what is needed to meet housing need.

Tough times: Jack Dromey said that the government is failing new buyers who want to get onto the property market

'This Government's failing housing and economic policies are depriving millions of people of a decent home. Young families are locked out of home ownership. Too many are struggling with the choice between paying rent and feeding their families because rents have soared.

'Too many people presenting as homeless, staying in bed and breakfast and sleeping on our streets. And too many building workers on the dole and young people out of work desperate for an apprenticeship.'

Figures show that in 2012, annual housing starts totalled 98,280 - 11 per cent down from the 2011 figure.

Locked out: The number of homes that are available to new buyers is lower than before

This compares to a recent high of 183,000 housing starts in 2006, but numbers have fallen since the credit crunch to a low of 75,000 in 2009. The numbers recovered slightly but have now fallen back again.

However, the number of homes completed rose slightly over the past year - up 1 per cent to 115,620 in 2012.

A spokesman for the Department for Communities and Local Government said: 'The Government is far from complacent, which is why despite the need to tackle the deficit we're investing £19.5billion public and private funding in an affordable housing programme set to deliver 170,000 homes, putting £1.3billion into unlocking stalled sites and building the infrastructure we need and making enough formerly used, surplus public sector land available to deliver 33,000 new homes.

'And to help aspiring homeowners get their foot on the housing ladder, the Funding for Lending scheme is helping improve the access to and availability of mortgages, while our FirstBuy and NewBuy schemes are helping thousands of people buy newly-built homes with a fraction of the deposit they would normally require.'

The British Property Federation said the country needs to end its obsession with owner occupation and consider a range of housing options, including build to let.

Ian Fletcher, the organisation's director of policy, said: 'Against the backdrop of these figures we need to seriously think about how we're going to build the homes this country needs to meet growing demand.

'As things stand the owner occupied model just isn't delivering the required numbers, and we need to focus on a range of options.

'To improve overall housing supply it needs to be affordable, does not require access to mortgage finance and not put undue strain on tight public finances. An institutional-funded professional rented sector, building to let, ticks all these boxes.'
