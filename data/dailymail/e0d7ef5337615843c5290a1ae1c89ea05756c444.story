Uruguay have landed in Brazil ahead of the World Cup, and Luis Suarez is with them looking fit and ready to fire.

The South Americans landed in Belo Horizonte on Monday, as their World Cup preparations clicked into full gear.

Uruguay are set to play their first game of the tournament against Costa Rica on Saturday, before facing England and Italy in their remaining Group D games. VIDEO: Scroll down for Suarez leaves hospital before promising he'll play at World Cup

There had been fitness doubts surrounding Suarez, who is Uruguay's top scorer in history, but it's looking more and more likely that he'll be ready to take the World Cup by storm from the start.

The Liverpool striker has been in superb form all year, and has been linked with a summer move to Real Madrid - rumours that were further fuelled after Carlo Ancelotti calling Suarez a 'fantastic' player, and his refusal to rule out a move for him.

The Champions League winners have been linked with a big-money move for the Uruguay hitman 
and Ancelotti says that Madrid will wait until after the World Cup to do any prospective business.

Options: Uruguay coach Oscar Tabarez will hope to have Suarez available for his team's opening game

Last hurrah: Diego Forlan will bring a wealth of experience to Brazil

Karim
 Benzema impressed this season for Madrid but there is a clamour in 
Spain's capital for Real to improve by purchasing the 27-year-old 
Premier League Golden Boot winner.

'It is 
difficult to improve what we have,' said Ancelotti. 'Luis Suarez is a 
fantastic player, but it is disrespectful to talk about a transfer now.'

He added: 'We're in no rush and we don't need to bring in a lot of players. We have until August 31.'

England's Group D opponents Costa Rica also touched down in Brazil on Monday evening.

The Central Americans face Uruguay this weekend, before games with Italy and Roy Hodgson's Three Lions.
