Marijuana users in Colorado will soon have to pay more for their recreational drug of choice, while residents of Houston, Texas, will likely see the Astrodome razed to the ground in the aftermath of Tuesday's vote on various ballot measures.Â 

LIGHTING UP: MAINE PUSHES FOR LEGAL POT AND COLORADO WANTS 'WEED TAX'

Voters in Colorado approved a 25 per cent tax on newly legal recreational marijuana to fund school construction. Opponents argued the tax rate would benefit black market sales.

Meanwhile, residents of Portland, Maine, declared victory on a measure to legalize possession of recreational amounts of marijuana.

SELLING BEER UP FOR DEBATE IN ONE OF UTAH'S LAST DRY CITIES

Utah is dealing with their own controversial move as there is a measure to sell beer in the town of Hyde Park.

It is one of the largely-Mormon state's remaining dry cities, as so many of the religious residents observe Mormon law which bans the consumption of alcohol and caffeine.

GAMBLING ON THE VOTE: PROPOSED CASINO CONSTRUCTION

New York voters bet big Tuesday on casino gambling as an economic energy shot, agreeing to let seven Las Vegas-style gaming palaces be built around the state, including eventually in New York City.

In a measure that became a referendum on the job-creating potential and social price of gambling, a constitutional amendment allowing the casinos was approved 57 per cent to 43 per cent, with 60 percent of the vote counted.

The vote was a major win for Gov. Andrew Cuomo, who proposed casinos as a way to aid the long-distressed upstate economy. The first four casinos would be built upstate, at sites to be chosen by developers. A New York City casino would be built in seven years and possibly more could be built in the suburbs, although some casino operators say the law could allow that sooner.

In contrast, residents of Palmer, Massachusetts, rejected Mohegan Sun's plan for a $1billion resort casino and entertainment complex.

And Suffolk Downs says it will reassess plans to build a resort casino at the 78-year-old thoroughbred race track after voters in a Boston neighborhood rejected its proposal and residents of a neighboring community approved it.

PAY RAISE: DEBATE OVER MINIMUM WAGE IN WASHINGTON AND NEW JERSEY

In New Jersey, voters passed a constitutional amendment raising the state's minimum wage by $1, to $8.25 an hour, and to provide for automatic cost-of-living increases, as 10 other states already do.

Washington's increase is much more dramatic as they already have the highest rate in the country at $9.19 an hour. Today's ballot proposal is pushing for the minimum wage at the Seattle airport and the surrounding hotels will be paid $15 an hour.

Early returns Tuesdya night showed the the measure is poised to pass by a narrow margin.

PAVING PARADISE: THE 'EIGHTH WONDER' TO BE DEMOLISHED OVER DEBTS

Voters rejected a plan to authorize bonds to turn the Houston Astrodome, the world's first multipurpose domed stadium, into a giant convention and event center and exhibition space. The outcome means the stadium is likely to be torn down

It hasn't been the home field for any sports team since 1999 and has accrued $217million in bonds over the years.
