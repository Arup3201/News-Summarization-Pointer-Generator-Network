A new form of methamphetamine has been found in a Texas City middle school after a group of eighth-grade girls began behaving strangely and were caught with the drugs.

According authorities, during afternoon classes at Blocker Middle School on Monday the six girls began acting 'zombie-like' and 'delirious'.

School staff found small paper squares on the girls that authorities say had been soaked in liquid methamphetamine and then wrapped in foil.

According to the sheriff's office, the drug is ingested by placing the stamp on the tongue and allowing it to dissolve.

Deputies at Galveston County Sheriffs Office say they have never seen methamphetamine in this form before.

Liquid methamphetamine is typically found in bottles, and has been found being smuggled over the border from Mexico. The meth-soaked paper is new to the district.

School staff immediately called paramedics and the girls were treated at a local hospital before being sent home to their parents.

Spokesperson for Texas City ISD Melissa Tortorici said the girls are currently suspended while police investigate the incident.

'Until the investigation is complete, we will not know the disciplinary action that will be implemented,' she said.

According to a press release, the paper strips are being analyzed to determine exactly what is in them after preliminary tests showed methamphetamine.

Authorities have warned that if this substance is found it should not be touched with bare hands, as it can be absorbed through the skin.

'If it was my child I'd be extremely upset,' Sheriff Henry Trochesset said.

He told reporters that authorities are investigating who gave the drugs to the girls and that the drugs came from 'outside the county.'

The six girls have not been charged with any crime.

A letter was sent home with Blocker Middle School students Thursday afternoon, notifying parents of the situation and encouraging them to talk to their children about the dangers of drugs.

Parents of Blocker Middle School students were shocked to hear about the drugs on campus.

'For eighth grade, yeah. For high school, maybe not so much.Â  But eighth grade... they're little kids. My daughter is only 13,' Jennifer Kincer told Click 2 Houston.
