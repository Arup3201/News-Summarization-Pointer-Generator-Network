When Adam Lallana put pen to paper at Liverpool on Monday, he joined a long list of Everton fans to have signed for the club's fierce local rivals.

The midfielder will wear red instead of blue on his next visit to Goodison Park as he bids to claim victory against the team he grew up supporting as a boy.

But Lallana isn't the only Evertonian to have plied his trade at Anfield. Here Sportsmail takes a look at how six other stars got on after crossing the Stanley Park divide.

ADAM LALLANA

Born in St Albans but choosing to support Everton like his father, Lallana used to go along to Goodison Park with his Dad and watched the likes of Duncan Ferguson and Neville Southall star for the Toffees as the club won the FA Cup in 1995.

However, the England international admits the club's glory days were in the past when he became a fan.

'Dad used to reminisce about the good old days when Everton won the old first division championship and the FA Cup back in the 1970s and 80s but they weren’t quite so good when I started supporting them,' he said.

The former Blue will be hoping for a Liverpool win when his boyhood club visit Anfield in September.

JAMIE CARRAGHER

Having once described himself as 'the biggest Blue in Bootle', Jamie Carragher ended up playing over 500 league games for the red half of Merseyside.

However the former centre back and Sportsmail columnist has freely admitted the love he had for the Toffees growing up.

'I was a total Everton fanatic right through my childhood and teens,' Carragher said in 2008.

'Everton controlled my life and dominated my thoughts 24/7. I went to the away games, followed them across Europe and in the mid-80s went to Wembley so often it began to feel like Alton Towers.

'When I talk about that Everton team I still say 'we'. Even when I was playing for Liverpool reserves I'd want Everton's first team to win the derby every time.'

Following Michael Thomas' last-gasp winner which denied Liverpool the 1989 First Division title, an 11-year-old Carragher applauded lads who scrawled 'Thank You Arsenal' on the wall of a Bootle pub.

During the defender's Liverpool testimonial against the Toffees in 2010, Carragher scored for both sides - the Reds legend hijacking Yakubu's penalty to score an 'own goal' from the spot.

IAN RUSH

Born in St Asaph in Wales, boyhood Everton fan Ian Rush joined Liverpool from Chester City in 1980 and went on to score nearly 250 league goals for the club.

Ask any Blue about the Welshman and they'll probably roll their eyes before admitting most of those strikes probably came against Everton!

Rush, who scored twice in Liverpool's 3-2 triumph in the 1989 FA Cup final over Everton, holds the record for the most Merseyside derby goals having found the net 25 times against the club he supported as a youngster.

However, having spent a combined 15 years during two spells at Anfield, Rush did get the chance to wear the royal blue shirt during his playing days.

The marksman appeared on the front cover of Shoot Magazine in 1989 wearing an Everton top. However, when shocked supporters turned to the story, it was revealed the 'transfer' was all part of an elaborate April Fools' Day hoax!

ROBBIE FOWLER

Given the nickname 'God' by the Anfield faithful, Robbie Fowler grew up as an Everton fan before joining Liverpool's academy at age 11.

The deadly striker, who scored 183 goals for the Reds during two spells at the club, even turned down a move to Goodison Park as a teenager after falling in love with his surroundings.

In an interview with Goal.com in 2009, Fowler said: 'When I was very young I used to watch them (Everton) but I was at Liverpool when I was 11 years old – I’ve been a Liverpool fan from then on.

'Obviously I grew up watching very, very good Everton sides but I always knew deep down Liverpool were a better team.

'Before I was 14 years old I had a chance to sign for Everton but being at Liverpool, I was quite a loyal lad and because they had raised me I just didn’t want to jump ship.

'At that time it would have been easier to get into the Everton first team but I stuck to my guns and am happy with decision I made!'

MICHAEL OWEN

After his father Terry started his career with Everton in the mid-sixties, Michael Owen grew up supporting the Toffees.

As a youngster, when having a kick-about with his Dad, Owen would pretend to be former Everton frontman Gary Lineker.

Shortly after starting high school, Chelsea, Arsenal, Manchester United and Liverpool all showed an interest in Owen, and, despite being a Blue, the striker decided to join the Reds.

The frontman went on to become one of the Premier League's most-lethal finishers and burst onto the scene by scoring on his Liverpool debut against Wimbledon in May 1997.

STEVE McMANAMAN

Steve McManaman was desperate to sign for Everton but ended up starting his career with Liverpool before earning a move to Spanish giants Real Madrid in 1999.

In a 2004 interview with Four Four Two, Mcmanaman said: 'When I was younger I was desperate to sign for Everton but they weren't as forthcoming as Liverpool. For a young player, 15 years old, your chances were so much better at Liverpool.

'I think that when I was about signing age Liverpool's youth policy was much better than Everton's.'

McManaman was such a big Blue that during Liverpool training if he ever found the net with his head the wideman would shout 'Latchford!' after Everton legend Bob, who played up front for the Toffees during the 70s.

STEVE MCMAHON

One of the few players to have represented both Merseyside clubs, Steve McMahon spent four years at Everton between 1979 and 1983 before moving to Liverpool in 1985 after two seasons at Aston Villa.

Born in Halewood, Liverpool, the tough tackling midfielder cited Blues legend Alan Ball as his childhood hero and an FA Cup victory against Liverpool as his favourite moment in an interview with Shoot magazine in the early 1980s.

Despite his connections with the Toffees, McMahon went on to make over 200 appearances for Liverpool during a six-year period, winning three league titles and two FA Cups.

PS - And what about these two...

STEVEN GERRARD

After a photo emerged of Liverpool captain Steven Gerrard wearing a full Everton kit and posing with the club's trophies as a youngster, arguments ensued across Merseyside about whether or not the Reds' talisman actually grew up a Blue.

However, it transpired that after Everton had won the First Division in 1987, Gerrard’s uncle Leslie took Stevie - then
 seven - to Goodison Park to have his photo taken with the trophy and 
the Charity Shield. Leslie even bought his nephew a new Everton kit for 
the photo shoot.

Rather amusingly, Everton fans often joke that the photo is the closest Gerrard has ever got to the title!

WAYNE ROONEY

Rumour has it Liverpool offered a trial to Wayne Rooney before his beloved Blues spotted him.

The staunch Toffee - who was once a mascot at a Merseyside derby - did accept Liverpool's offer but insisted on wearing his full Everton kit.

Eventually ending up at Goodison Park, the frontman went on to live the dream and marked his arrival in an Everton shirt by scoring that goal against Arsenal in 2002 aged just 16.

However, having once famously revealed a shirt which read 'Once a Blue, Always a Blue', Rooney eventually went on to play in red when he joined Manchester United in 2004.
