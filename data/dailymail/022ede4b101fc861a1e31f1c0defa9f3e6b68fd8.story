David Rodgers: The long-term heroin user, 62, stuffed the needle into a loaf on sale in a Tesco store

A heroin-using grandfather who stuffed a used syringe into a supermarket loaf of bread that was later bought by an unsuspecting mother has been jailed for a year.

The woman discovered the needle - which had been stuck through the middle of the loaf by 62-year-old David Rodgers - after she used the bread to make her 10-year-old son a chicken sandwich for his school lunchbox, Manchester Crown Court heard.

Rodgers, from Weaste, who was traced by a speck of his blood left inside the syringe, had contaminated the loaf in a branch of Tesco Extra in Salford last December.

He claimed to be 'deeply remorseful' when he appeared in the dock to answer charges of contaminating or interfering with goods with intent to cause public alarm or anxiety in a rare case.

The needle he concealed in the loaf was found to contain no infectious diseases.

Jailing him, Mr Recorder Stuart Driver QC rejected as 'totally implausible' Rodgers' claim that he put the needle in the bread in a bid to hide his drug 'lapse' from his wife of 39 years.

Rodgers 'intended that syringe should be found by somebody and that person should suffer trauma', the judge said.

The court heard that Rodgers had 114 offences to his name on a criminal record stretching back to 1959, and that he had used heroin on and off for more than 20 years.

The court heard that the mum bought the bread while shopping at Tesco Extra on December 1.

She had already used a couple of slices to make her son's sandwich when she felt 'something hard' in the loaf, which she was 'alarmed and distressed' to discover was an orange hypodermic needle.

She added: 'Even though I was told the chance of any virus or illness surviving in the syringe was minimal, I was still very worried. I also had a three-month-old baby at the time and this caused unnecessary stress.'

Rodgers was revealed as the culprit after the bakery collected the bread and it was sent off by police for testing.Â 

Following his arrest, Rodgers claimed he had a 'relapse' into heroin use in early December, and had gone into Tesco with the needle in his pocket.

'Bizarre and shocking': A judge said Rodgers' claim he put the needle in the loaf at the store in Salford, Greater Manchester, to hide his drug 'relapse' from his wife was 'totally implausible'

Marsha Myers, defending, said it was a 'bizarre' and 'shocking' case, but argued for the defendant to be given a suspended sentence, describing him as 'troubled' by ill-health and depression.

But, the sentencing judge said offences like these called for 'deterrent sentences'.

Locking him up, Mr Recorder Driver QC told him: 'You intended the food to be purchased, you intended that syringe should be found by somebody and that person should suffer trauma, to be shocked and worried by what they found, and you succeeded in exactly that.'
