Louis van Gaal has said he will look to make changes to Manchester United's Carrington training complex because of the amount of wind that reaches the pitches.

The Dutchman, speaking in his first press conference since taking the reigns at Old Trafford, described the facilities as 'fantastic' but said something must be done about how windy it gets.

'The (training ground) needs some more intimacy and I have asked (for that) already,' Van Gaal explained.

‘Because now it is an open field and there is always wind and wind is not always the friend of the players and the football. So we have to do something about that. But the facilities are fantastic.’

Man in charge: Van Gaal says United should change the training complex as it gets too windy

Sir Alex Ferguson ensured major changes were made to United's training facilities towards the end of the nineties, fearing that they would be inadequate for a team looking to dominate the Premier League in the 21st century.

Construction work began to upgrade Carrington in 1999, with £22million spent before the facilities were re-opened in the summer of 2000. Another £8m was spent on the Academy Facility, which opened two years later.

And in 2013, a medical and sports science facility worth £25m was unveiled, taking the club's spending on the overall complex to more than £60m.

Ferguson described the enhanced training headquarters as his 'best signing' and well worth the investment from the club.

'It's given us a training facility where all the players are saying, 'Wow, this is some training ground now'. It's one of the best. And I think if any player were to come here with any doubts about where they should be, they'll soon find out that this is a fantastic set-up.'

Making his point: Van Gaal speaks out during his first-ever press conference as United boss

Van Gaal took time to praise the sense of community he has found since arriving in Manchester on Wednesday.

‘It’s unbelievable how many people are working for the same cause,' he said.

‘It’s also a family and everybody is proud to work for Manchester United.

‘That feeling I have is fantastic.'

The former Bayern Munich boss said he was pleased United's season tickets had already sold out ahead of the start of the 2014-15 Premier League season.

‘I have heard that the season-tickets are already sold out and I am very proud.

‘I hope you support us when we are losing and not only winning, because we will win and lose together.’
