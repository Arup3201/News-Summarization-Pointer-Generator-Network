The ex-wife of Austrian gun maker Gaston Glock has lost a battle to claim a share of her husband's company, Austria’s highest court has ruled.

Helga Glock had launched various legal actions demanding that a 15 per cent share in the company Glock GmbH that she had transferred over to the Glock Privatstiftung, a private family trust, be returned.

The verdict is the latest instance in a bitter feud between 84-year-old Gaston Glock - the Austrian inventor of the handgun used by two-thirds of U.S. police departments - and his wife of 49 years until they divorced in 2011.

Helga Glock also provided a sworn affidavit in support of her motion in which she detailed the circumstances of her break-up with her ex-husband.

According to her testimony, their separation began when Gaston Glock had a stroke in October 2008.

'As he was recovering in the hospital, weak and frail, Mr Glock was being "looked after" by Katrin Tschikof, his 50-year-old younger girlfriend who was downright engrossed with him,' Helga said.

'She totally denied me and other family members any access to Glock Sr. warning us that such contact would threaten another stroke or possibly cause death.'

Soon after, Helga said her former husband began 'breaking off the contact' with her and their children.

She also said Gaston began 'pushing his family out' of the trust which the erstwhile couple had established for their wealth and stake in his company.

She argued she played an integral role in the growth of the company and said he relieved her and their children of their roles at the firm.

Helga Glock’s law firm, Willheim Mueller Rechtsanwaelte, did not immediately respond to calls seeking comment.
