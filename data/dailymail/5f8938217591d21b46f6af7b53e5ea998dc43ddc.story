He is the multi-millionaire who couldn’t get anyone at Rangers to answer his calls. The ambitious bidder who tried, in vain, to block the cut-price sale of Lewis Macleod to mighty Brentford.

A man with a track record in running an elite sports team within budget, Robert Sarver found two attempts to gain control at financially-ruined and forever-endangered Rangers thwarted by those clinging to power — and by rival-shareholder blocks who would rather do things their own way.

Will he be back with a third offer? Well, for a man apparently ruling out a return to the fray, Sarver sounded just a little too upbeat and positive as he took to the airwaves on Monday night. Even as he was delivering some pretty damning criticism of the current Ibrox regime.

US businessman Robert Sarver made two offers for Rangers but his calls to the club's board were ignored

The managing partner of the Phoenix Suns National Basketball Association franchise had clearly invested some degree of thought in how his financial might and major-league expertise could benefit an ailing SPFL club with a huge potential fan base.

That all his optimism and obvious ability to fund a Rangers renaissance should apparently be ignored by the current regime is almost beyond belief.

Yet Sarver insisted: ‘I really never could get them to engage meaningfully in any discussion.

‘At the end of the day, I guess that’s why I formally withdrew my bid — because I couldn’t get them to the table. I never received a counter-offer or any discussion of substance.

‘I knew their issues were short-term funding and that they didn’t want to dilute the current shareholders.

‘But those two things are really hard to do at the same time because the club, as most people know, needs funding.

‘Listen, there are no guarantees of success in sport. All you can do is put your best foot forward, make sure your club is capitalised properly and put the best coaching staff in place to make the best decisions — give it your best shot.

‘That’s what I was prepared to do.

‘My plan was to kind of permanently capitalise the club over the next two to three years — so it had the best chances of being successful and getting back to being one of the top two teams in the Scottish league.’

When any businessman talks about being willing to ‘capitalise’ a company, what he means is invest money in pursuit of growth. That was clearly on the agenda of a man who firmly believed the relative stability of his basketball team could be emulated at Ibrox.

‘Definitely,’ he said, adding: ‘The thing about these sports clubs is you may own them — but they really belong to the community. So you are really more of a custodian.

‘And it’s all about winning. That’s the only reason you get involved in professional sport.

‘I’m a professional guy, my stock trades on the New York Stock Exchange. The banking company and the Phoenix Suns records are in the paper every day.

‘So it’s full transparency — and all about winning, creating sustained success.’ 

The current Rangers board remain in negotiations with the Three Bears consortium, while former director Dave King’s recent acquisition of a large stake in the club further complicates matters.

Rangers went into administration in February 2012 and were later relegated to the Scottish Third Division

Meanwhile, the club do not have the cash to pay off a manager serving his notice, never mind start recruiting for a head coach capable of steering them to promotion. And few would be shocked if more talent was sold off before the month is out.

Sarver insisted that both of his offers would have allowed many of those putting together their own bids to remain part of the project. He also revealed that his initial £18million package had one very interesting condition attached.

‘As part of the condition of that first offer, I had it in there that they couldn’t sell any players,’ he said.

‘The day after I submitted the offer, they sold one of the more promising young players (Macleod). So that deal was kind of crushed.

‘My second offer was intended to provide more flexibility. So what I intended to do was loan £6.5m for the short-term cash flow issues, then give the board the discretion to sell me between £16m and £20m of equity as they saw fit.

‘So they could minimise the dilution if they wanted or they could sell me more shares and put more money in the club.

‘The £6.5m was a loan. That would have been repaid through the share issue. The new capital going into the club would have been between £16m and £20m — and then the additional money that I would offer to pay to buy out any shareholders.

‘But my hope was that most of them would stay in. Under the law of the London Stock Exchange, you have to make that offer to all the shareholders.’

Asked outright if he would be back with a third bid, the 52-year-old said: ‘I have to be careful with all these securities rules you guys have other there.

‘It’s hard to do somewhat of a hostile deal from 5,000 miles away. It’s really not my style.

‘I was just really trying to be helpful to the club and the fans, and say: “Hey, I’ll bring in a bunch of capital. And we do have some pretty good expertise here at the Suns”.

‘There are a lot of areas I thought we could help in. Our strength and conditioning, our experience with fan engagement and interaction, our analytics group and things like that. And let’s combine that with a world-class coach, manager, and executive, and let’s give the team the best possible chance.

‘That was really, simply, my goal.’

As part of his £20m offer, Sarver was willing to hand Rangers an emergency £6.5m loan

Sarver again insisted he hadn’t been acting as a front for other investors unwilling to show their faces, admitting: ‘To be honest, I understand the concerns of the fans because of all the trials and tribulations the club has been through. So they have every right to be sceptical.

‘But everyone kind of over-read my interest. It was really, really simple. It was just my family looking to make an investment in soccer.

‘We had hired a firm and we were going down the path of looking for an investment in either England or Spain. At the time, while some of that information was sitting on our coffee table, my kids’ soccer coach, Davie Robertson, was looking at it and said: “Hey, you’ve got to look at this team I played for. The timing is great: they really need the money, they really need some help. You ought to look at it”.

‘The more I looked at it, the more I liked it. It is as simple as that. There was no other story.

‘I had never met anybody, who had ever had anything to do with the club.

‘I’m a believer in the idea that basketball and soccer are two great long-term investments.

‘Because they’re the only two major sports played internationally, wherever you go, and they’re both played by men and women.

‘So soccer has been of interest for some while. It’s the sport of choice for my three sons. That’s why my interest was piqued.’

He sounds like a man still interested in the game. Still able to put some struggling club back on a sound footing. If only someone would take his call.
