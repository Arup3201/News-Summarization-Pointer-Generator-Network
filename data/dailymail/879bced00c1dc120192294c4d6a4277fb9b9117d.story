Precision Guided Firearms (PGFs) that can automatically aim at targets? Terrifyingly, there’s an app for that.

Known as TagTrackXact (TTX), Texas firm TrackingPoint’s software is used to enable an advanced array of weaponry.

And in a new video, one YouTube user shows how TTX lets him hit a smartphone with a rifle from one kilometre (0.62 miles) away.

TrackingPoint's TagTrackXact software enables a shooter to accurately fire at targets by 'painting' them in the distance before the software helps them align their gun. Others can even follow along with the action on an iOS app on an iPhone or an iPad (pictured)

In the video YouTube user RatedRR is firing the XS1 .338 Lapua Magnum, which he says is the ‘largest-calibre Precision Guided Firearm available today.’

A laser rangefinder is used by the shooter looking through the scope to identify the target that he or she wants to hit.

The
 high-tech sight then takes into account humidity, wind and the typical 
ballistic drop you'd expect from a bullet fired over such a distance.

Once
 the target has been selected, the scope provides cross-hairs which have
 to be lined up with the pin that is dropped on the target.

To ensure accuracy, the shooter can not even squeeze the trigger unless the cross-hairs and pin are alined.

The rifle employs the aforementioned TTX targeting system, which boasts a range of up to 1.1 kilometres (0.68 miles).

Using the system allows for accurate and precise shots of a distant target - even one as small as a smartphone.

To shoot at something, the shooter first 'marks' it using a button near the trigger.

Marking a target illuminates it with the tracking scope's built-in laser, and the target gains a red pin in the scope's display.

The scope then provides cross-hairs that have to be lined up with the pin, with the shooter not able to pull the trigger unless the two are aligned.

In the video YouTube user RatedRR fires several shots at an HTC One (stock image shown), highlighting the impressive level of accuracy of the gun. He mentions, though, that the central dot is quite big so at a distance of one kilometre (0.62 miles) it is hard to know which part of the phone he is shooting at

The US military has been testing out some of the Precision Guided Firearms (pictured) with a view to employing them in the field in the future. Back in January it was reported they acquired six $27,000 (£16,000) smart rifles from Texas-based TrackingPoint

The rifle also offers an iOS app that connects to the scope via a mobile Wi-Fi network and streams the scope's display to the app, allowing someone with an iPad or iPhone to act as a spotter and for videos to be uploaded to the Internet.

This allows hunters to gain instant advice on their aim from experts using the Internet and more interestingly allows shooters to video anything they shoot on an expedition and upload it onto the web as proof.

The makers of the rifle also claim that the gun is safer than a standard bolt action rifle.

This is because a large number of injuries are caused by recoiling guns fired by nervous shooters with twitch fingers.

TrackingPoint’s rifle increases the pull strength of the trigger until the target is aligned.

In this way, the hunter is more likely to hit their target and accidental firings can be largely avoided.

The smart rifles can shoot even if the target is moving as fast as 10 miles (16 kilometres) per hour.

All of TrackingPoint’s firearms use the company’s TTX system – which tracks range, drop, magnus effect, spindrift, coriolis effect, direction, cant, inclination, pressure, temperature, humidity, muzzle velocity, barrel length and twist, lock time, ballistic coefficient and drag coefficient.
