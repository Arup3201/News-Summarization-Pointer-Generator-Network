A mother who took her critically ill son abroad for cancer treatment against the wishes of NHS doctors says the decision saved his life and could do the same for Ashya King.

Ros Barnes raised £130,000 to take her child Alex to America  to have the proton therapy treatment when he was four.

She said British doctors told her that medics offering the treatment were 'only after your money' but they still took Alex abroad because they feared radiotherapy could make their son deaf and blind.

Treatment: Ros Barnes raised £130,000 to take her critically ill child Alex to America to have the proton therapy treatment when he was four - and he has recovered from his brain tumour

Row: Mrs Barnes said NHS doctors had said that medics offering this therapy abroad were after her money

'When we were told that he had to have radiotherapy and that his tumour had come back, we were told that because he was only four, it would cause significant brain damage, he might be in a wheelchair or deaf or blind - if he made it at all,' she told ITV's Good Morning Britain.

'So when I asked the NHS about proton therapy, the oncologist said it's not tried and tested and if you go over there [to the United States], they're only after your money.

'And I said well, they can have my money. If it works, I don't care. We'll get him there and we'll do what we've got to do.

'Most of the doctors I spoke to advised against it. Obviously it saved his life. He's here and he's perfect.'

The difference between proton beam therapy and conventional forms of radiotherapy is that it is thought to cause less damage to the healthy tissue around the tumour. 

Proton therapy is a type of radiation that uses beams of protons - small parts of an atom - rather than high energy X-rays, used in conventional radiotherapy.

Unlike an X-ray, the proton stops after striking the target rather than continuing to travel through the body.

It means therapists to direct the beam at a tumour more precisely. The beam can be more finely controlled, in both its width and its depth, so higher doses of radiation can be more safely delivered to tumours, with less risk to healthy tissues.

The treatment has been shown to be beneficial in the treatment of many different tumours, including those found in the head and neck, eye, central nervous system, lung, prostate and gastrointestinal tract.

The precision of the pencil beam scanning makes it especially beneficial in treating tumours adjacent to critical and sensitive organs, such as the eye, brain and spinal cord.

For that reason it is particularly suited to children, who are more susceptible to harm from radiation because they are still growing.

Conventional radiotherapy uses X-rays to kill cancer cells. But X-rays pass through the tumour and out the other side, damaging tissue. Protons, which are positively charged particles in the centre of any atom, stop when they reach the tumour.

The treatment is popular in Europe because it has a lower risk of side effects, though some have expressed concerns because little is known about the long-term impact of the procedure.

The only proton beam facility in the UK is at the Clatterbridge Centre for Cancer in the Wirral, which delivers ‘low energy’ therapy for rare cancers around the eye. 

The treatment, which costs £100,000 a patient, is not widely available on the NHS, but is commonly used throughout Europe.

A moving video made minutes before he was arrested Mr King, 51, said they had gone overseas to try and get specialist cancer treatment which he said medics in the UK refused to sanction.

Mr King said: ‘We pleaded with (the doctors) for proton beam treatment. They looked at me straight in the face and said with his cancer - which is called medulloblastoma - it would have no benefit whatsoever.’

His son, who is suffering from a stage four brain tumour, is being cared for at the Materno-Infantil hospital in Malaga. The family is banned from seeing him and he is under police guard.
