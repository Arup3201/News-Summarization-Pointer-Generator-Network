A man born with giant feet has finally been given a pair of shoes that fit at the age of 27.

Xu Anyou from Fuzhou, in eastern China's Jiangxi Province, has a form of Elephantiasis.

Elephantiasis results in the enlargement of an area of the body, especially the limbs.

Xu Anyou was born with a condition which made his feet grow but now he finally has pair of shoes that fit (right)

Parasitic worms, spread by mosquitoes, can grow up to four inches long and block the lymphatic system, causing arms, legs, breasts or genitals to swell to huge sizes.

As Xu grew older his feet became so large he was unable to find a suitable pair of shoes.

In the summer he would go barefoot while in the winter he would have to wear a specially made pair constructed by his brother. 

But after hearing about Xu's plight, the manager of a local company has presented him with three pairs of tailor-made shoes which are 28.5cm long and 22.5cm wide.

The kind manager has also said he would provide Xu with free shoes when these pairs needed replacing.

Last year a boy underwent surgery at a hospital in China because his feet grew so big he was unable to walk.

Teenager Xiao Meng was born with a genetic condition that causes the feet to swell abnormally.

Xiao's family were too poor to pay for treatment and, as a result, his feet grew bigger and bigger with age.

His family received thousands of pounds towards his care as a result of a campaign.

In 2007, 546 million people around the world were treated to prevent elephantiasis.

A total of 81 countries are endemic for the disease.

Infection is usually happens in childhood but the painful and profoundly disfiguring visible manifestations of the disease occur later in life.

Lymphatic filariasis leads to permanent disability.

Approximately 65 per cent of those infected live in the South-East Asia Region, 30 per cent in the African Region and the remainder in other tropical areas.

The medical term for elephantiasis is Lymphatic filariasis. 

Infection occurs when filarial parasites are transmitted to humans through mosquitoes. 

When a mosquito with infective stage larvae bites a person, the parasites are deposited on the person's skin from where they enter the body.

The larvae then migrate to the lymphatic vessels where they develop into adult worms in the human lymphatic system.

Patients with chronic disabilities like elephantiasis, lymphoedema, or hydrocele are advised to maintain rigorous hygiene and take necessary precautions to prevent secondary infection and aggravation of the disease condition.
