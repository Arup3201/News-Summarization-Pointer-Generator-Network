Zephyr is a younger brother to Winter, two, who apparently couldn’t wait to be a big sister. 

Mr and Mrs Parker announced that they were expecting in September, telling People: 'We are overjoyed and excited to welcome the new arrival into our family.'

Mr Parker, 35, who served as Facebook's first president and co-founded the music-sharing service Napster in the late Nineties, married Alexandra, a singer-songwriter, in an elaborate Game of Thrones-themed wedding in June 2013, which reportedly cost $10 million.

The nuptials, which took place in Big Sur, California, were attended by celebrity guests including Emma Watson, Metallica's Lars Ulrich, Allison Williams and Olivia Munn.

For the over-the-top ceremony, Mr Parker built fake ruins, waterfalls, a cottage, staircases and a dance floor on an ecologically sensitive campsite, for which he didn't have the proper permits, and was later fined $2.5 million by the state of California.

As part of the settlement, he recently agreed to build a beach-mapping app for the California Coastal Commission.

Mr Parker, who currently serves on Spotify’s board, proposed to his wife in February 2011 after dating for less than a year. He was famously played by Justin Timberlake in the 2010 David Fincher film The Social Network.
