The University of Maine changed their minds this week after originally stating they were not going to allow candy canes in common areas on Campus.

When Executive Director of Auxiliary Services Daniel Stirrup sent out an email on Monday saying that religious themed decorations including candy canes and Christmas trees were going to be banned from public spaces, students were outraged and were able to sway the school administration in their favor.

The school later apologized for banning the decorations and called the whole incident a 'misunderstanding' citing the fact they were merely trying to be inclusive following a student's complaint about Christmas-centric 'religious' decorations. 

Banned decorations: Administrators at the University of Maine banned all Christmas decorations on Monday 

'We are not the Grinches of Maine, Dean of Students Robert Dana told Fox.

'It was a big misunderstanding. The e-mail was in response to an issue a student had raised. His intent was to be inclusive.'

Stirrup originally banned any 'decoration that could be perceived as religious' and listed off items such as ' xmas trees, wreaths, xmas presents, candy canes, etc.'

'What is allowed are winter themes, plain trees without presents underneath, decorative lights, but not on trees, snowflakes, etc. If you are unsure, best to not use or ask me for clarification,' he said in his initial email.

Students at the school were so outraged after Monday's email they started a Facebook group dedicated to bringing back decorations on campus called 'Bring Cheer back to UMaine' that now has almost 1,000 supporters. 

They're back: After students complained about the lack of holiday cheer on campus the school allowed them to decorate with candy canes once again 

'How can we celebrate diversity if we can't even see it?

#bringbackthecheer,' the group posted two days ago following Monday's news.

'They didn't have to say it. They took down items put up by students expressing their 1st amendment rights. That is a violation of the Constitution of the United States of America. Whom ever made that decision has opened himself and the college up to multiple lawsuits,' said Arthur Nickerson.

The students were eventually able to regain their right to put up decorations and the Facebook group still remains to celebrate the holiday.
