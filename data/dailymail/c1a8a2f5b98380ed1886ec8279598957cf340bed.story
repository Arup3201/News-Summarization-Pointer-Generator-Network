Parents have complained after a BBC error showed a musician in a Womble suit remove its head during a live broadcast shattering the illusion that the furry creates exist.

The mistake was made during a live video stream on Simon Mayo's Drivetime radio show on Tuesday when Womble Orinoco whipped off his head as the webcam was still running.

Parents from all over the UK had tuned in with their youngsters to watch The Wombles appear exclusively on the Radio Two website and perform two songs, including Christmas number one hopeful Wombling Merry Christmas.

Whoops! The mistake was made during a live video stream on Simon Mayo's Drivetime radio show on Tuesday when Womble Orinoco whipped off his head as the webcam was still running

But as an interview with Simon Mayo came to a close, Orinico, played by songwriter Mike Batt, removed his head, leaving children 'horrified' that the Wombles were not real.

The BBC have now removed a link to the live feed from its website leaving just two songs and an interview with Simon Mayo left to view.

Mr Batt, who invented The Wombles pop group in the 70s, apologised on Twitter, but blamed BBC staff for telling him he was 'no longer on air' and so could safely remove his costume.

After being told that hundreds of children has seen he was inside the Womble, the 62-year-old musician and Womble tweeted: 'On no - they told us we were off air!!!!'

Not impressed: Peter McFarland, son Dylan and wife Vickie had been looking forward to the show all day and were horrified when Orinoco took his head off

This morning Mr Batt posted an explanation for the incident on his blog, assuring children wombles were 'very real indeed' adding: 'Everybody knows a Womble can't take his head off.'

He told the children he stepped in at the last minute posing as Orinoco who was feeling unwell in the heat of the studio.

Mr Batt, who invented The Wombles pop group in the 70s, apologised on Twitter

He wrote: 'Luckily, I carry a fancy dress Womble costume with me to all Womble appearances, so if the real Orinoco is too puffed out (because he is the fat one, and hardly does any exercise) I can run in, like a substitute in a football match) and take over, - which is what I did.

'We managed to get the real Orinoco off, during a cut in the camera coverage, and he was given oxygen and some nettle tea.'

He also said that he was meant to be 
given a two minute break in-between singing the songs and being 
interviewed by Simon Mayo, saying it was 'very hot' in the costume.

He
 said: 'I told them (the BBC) that I needed a break after the songs (as 
it) was a high heat effort - they were supposed to give me a two minute 
break!'

Parents from around the UK said the 
'damage had already been done' and that they had been forced to come up 
with 'all kinds of explanations' about why there was a human inside a 
Womble.

Father-of-four Peter McFarland, 34, of Shrewsbury, said he and six-year-old son Dylan had been looking forward to the show all day and that his son was horrified when he saw Orinoco take his head off.

Artist Mr McFarland said: 'I'm very very angry - we were watching the Radio Two live footage of the Wombles and at the end of the interview Orinoco pulled his head off before the cameras stopped rolling to reveal Mike Batt instead.

Some idiot at the BBC forgot to switch off the webcam at the end of the show and Dylan was right in front of the computer.

'I
 thought it might have been too brief for Dylan to have noticed as he 
went totally silent and we thought we might have got away with it, but 
then he said 'All Wombles are fake' and asked to go to Wimbledon Common 
to meet the real ones.

Mr Batt addressed children in a blog post telling them Womble were 'very real indeed'

'Now I have an absolutely crushed and distraught six-year-old.'

He added: 'One very angry email getting sent to the BBC now.'

Mother
 Vickie McFarland, 36, said: 'The Wombles have lost my support - 'My six
 year old son is heartbroken and now he doesn't believe the Wombles are 
real.

'Way to go breaking a little boy's heart and ruining Christmas for him.' 

Another
 mother, Christine Furniss, 43, of Stoke, said she had to explain to her
 two boys, Oscar, five, and Toby, seven, that Wombles were 'not real' 
after the error.

She said: 'They both looked at me for an explanation when Orinoco's head came off - what could I tell them?

'I had to tell them the truth and it's fair to say they were devastated.

'All
 of their friends were watching it at home too as it was a chance to see
 the Wombles perform the Christmas song - so a lot of children were left
 very, very upset about what happened.'

Another blogger said: 'Orinoco's eaten 
Mike Batt!  'I saw his head inside the Womble at the end of the video 
just before the feed switched off.'

The full video stream is no longer available to view after BBC chiefs cut it into three segments - none of which show Orinico's head being removed.

A spokesman for the BBC admitted that the Womble was not meant to remove his head until after the cameras had stopped rolling, but blamed Orinoco for the bungle.

She said: 'The Wombles played a festive set for Radio 2 which was filmed for live online streaming.

'The Wombles were aware they were being filmed, but he (Mike Batt) just took his head off.

'The group were fully aware that they were being filmed and had not been given the all clear that they were off air.'
