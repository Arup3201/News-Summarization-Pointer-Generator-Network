Desmond Tutu will be attending Nelson Mandela's funeral tomorrow after all, it has been confirmed.

The old friend of the former South African president previously said he had not been granted the credentials to attend the ceremony.

Mr Tutu said he was 'heartbroken' to be left off the guest list, and added it would have been 'disrespectful to gatecrash' the private event.

However, following an apparent u-turn by organisers, the archbishop is set to travel to the small town of Qunu tomorrow morning for the service.

Desmond Tutu pays tribute to Nelson Mandela at 
the memorial service in Johannesburg on Tuesday: The archbishop has 
announced that he's not been granted the credentials to attend Mr 
Mandela's funeral tomorrow

Mr Tutu's office said in a brief statement: 'Archbishop Emeritus Desmond Tutu will be traveling to Qunu early tomorrow to attend Tata's funeral.'

On social media the cleric's Desmond and Leah Tutu Legacy Foundation posted: 'Archbishop Emeritus Desmond Tutu will be travelling to Qunu early tomorrow to attend Tata's funeral.'

Earlier, it was suggested the cleric was not accredited to attend the event.

The retired 82-year-oldsaid he received 'no indication' he had been invited to the burial service.

Speaking to Sky News, he said: 'Much as I would have loved to attend the service to say a final farewell to someone I loved and treasured, it would have been disrespectful to Tata to gatecrash what was billed as a private family funeral.'

'The
 archbishop is not an accredited clergyperson for the event and thus 
will not be attending,' said Rev Mpho Tutu, the archbishop's daughter, 
in a statement.

She is chief executive of the Desmond and Leah Tutu Foundation.

Mr Tutu worked with the former South 
African president in his long struggle against apartheid.

He also welcomed Mr
 Mandela into his home after his fellow campaigner's release from jail.

The
 Nobel Peace Prize laureate and 
occasional critic of the current government, did speak at an earlier a memorial service in Soweto.

Some 4,000 people have been invited to attend the funeral of the anti-apartheid hero including family members, African leaders and several heads of states.

The Prince of Wales will also attend and is expected to arrive with the British High Commissioner Judith Macgregor in Qunu, the remote village where the South African president grew up.

More
 tributes were this morning paid to Mr Mandela during a ceremony at 
Waterkloof air base, on the southern outskirts of Pretoria, in a 
farewell from the African National Congress (ANC).

The
 military handed over the anti-apartheid icon's flag-draped coffin to 
the ANC at a solemn ceremony, including a multi-faith service and a 
musical tribute, that was broadcast live on South African television.

Current
 South African president Jacob Zuma praised Mr Mandela in a detailed 
recounting of the liberation struggle. He said Mr Mandela had the rare 
ability to put theory into practice.

'He did something that is not easy to do,' said Mr Zuma.

Icon: Mr Mandela was imprisoned for 27 years for
 opposing racist apartheid before emerging in 1990 to forge a new 
multi-racial democratic consensus in South Africa by promoting 
forgiveness and reconciliation

He
 also described Mr Mandela coming to Johannesburg from the countryside 
as a young man and bringing discipline and vision to the long and 
difficult anti-apartheid movement.

Mr
 Mandela was imprisoned for 27 years for opposing racist apartheid 
before emerging in 1990 to forge a new democratic South Africa by 
promoting forgiveness and reconciliation.

He became president in 1994 after South Africa's first all-race democratic elections.

Mr
 Zuma led the group in song after his speech. Mr Mandela's widow, Graca 
Machel, wearing black, wept and wiped tears from under her glasses. Mr 
Mandela's former wife Winnie Madikizela-Mandela, looking stricken, was 
there as well.

Mr Mandela's favourite poem, Invictus, was printed on the back of the programme.

After
 the ceremony, the former president's remains were taken on board a 
military plane and flown to Mthatha in the Eastern Cape, where it was to
 be greeted by a full military ceremony.

Rituals
 will also be performed before a motorcade takes the casket from Mthatha
 to the village of Qunu where Mr Mandela will be buried on tomorrow.

At
 the airport in Mthatha there was a buzz of activity today, with 
military vehicles driving around as anticipation built over the arrival 
of South Africa's most famous figure.

The
 public has been invited to view the cortege as it makes its way and 
residents and people who had travelled for hours thronged a road leading
 to Qunu, singing and dancing as Mandela T-shirts were handed out.

'We
 got up this morning at 2am and drove from Port Elizabeth - it's about 
seven hours - and we got here now. We're waiting to show our last 
respects to Madiba,' said Ebrahim Jeftha, using Mandela's clan name.

Soldiers
 in full gear were stationed on foot on either side of the road from the
 airport in Mthatha. Some civilians were also already lining the route, 
shielding themselves from the sun with umbrellas.

Mr
 Mandela had longed to spend his final months in his beloved rural 
village but instead he had spent them in a hospital in Pretoria and then
 in his home in Johannesburg where he had remained in a critical 
condition, suffering from lung problems and other ailments, until his 
death.

The body will be taken to the Mandela family farm, where more rituals will be performed.

A
 night vigil by the ANC is planned at Walter Sisulu University in 
Mthatha tonight, with party leaders and government officials honouring 
Mr Mandela on the eve of his burial.

The
 late president died last week aged 95. His body lay in state for three 
days this week, drawing huge crowds of South Africans who mourned his 
death and celebrated his successful struggle against apartheid.

Many
 were disappointed when they could not view his remains because long 
lines and traffic problems meant that thousands had to be turned away 
without paying their final respects.

There
 will be further disappointment that Mr Tutu, a well-respected figure in
 South Africa and internationally, will not have the opportunity to pay 
his final respects.

A spokesman for Mr Tutu refused to elaborate and said the retired archbishop himself would not be commenting.

However,
 a spokesman for the South African presidency later said Mr Tutu is 
definitely on the guest list, adding that he hopes a solution will be 
found that allows him to attend.

'Certainly he is invited,' Mac Maharaj said. 'He's an important person.'
