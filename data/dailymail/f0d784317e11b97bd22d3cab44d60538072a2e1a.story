A notorious child killer who raped and murdered a seven-year-old and was suspected to have strangled two other girls has died in prison at the age of 84.  

Raymond Morris was dubbed the 'Monster of Cannock Chase' after he snatched Christine Darby off the street in 1967 and killed her before dumping her on a patch of countryside in Staffordshire.  

He was also the prime suspect in the murders of five-year-old Diane Tift and Margaret Reynolds, six, who disappeared in 1965 and were later found dead near where Christine's body was discovered.  

The killings shocked the country and sparked one of the biggest murder investigations in history - even bigger than the hunt for the Moors murderers - leading to Morris being jailed in 1969.

Today the Ministry of Justice announced that Morris had died of natural causes at HMP Preston, after 45 years in prison.  

The Independent Prisons and Probation Ombudsman has launched an investigation into Morris' death, as is required by law.  

Jean Buttery, the sister of Diane Tift, described the killer - believed to have snatched Diane as she was walking to her grandmother's house - as 'evil'.  

'I'm glad he is dead but it will never bring my sister back,' she said today. 'It does bring some closure but you never forget. I think he was low-life scum. He was evil. Pure evil.'  

Dead: Morris has died at HMP Preston from natural causes at the age of 84

Investigation: Morris covered by a coat as he was escorted by police following his arrest in 1968 

The Cannock Chase murders appalled the countries after Diane and Margaret's bodies were found buried in a ditch in the beauty spot next to the A34.  

Diane had gone missing from her home in Bloxwich two weeks earlier, while Margaret Reynolds disappeared while walking to school in Aston the previous September.  

Police said the girls had been sexually abused before being strangled and having their bodies dumped in the countryside.  

A year later, the body of Christine Darby was discovered by a soldier on Cannock Chase - just a mile from the first grim discovery.  

She had also been taken from the street near her home before being strangled and raped.  

The hunt for the Cannock Chase killer saw 150 detectives visit 39,000 homes, interview 80,000 people and check more than a million car records, as well as issuing the first ever 'e-fit' composite picture of the suspect.  

Sensation: The news of Christine's death as it was reported on the front page of the Daily Mail in 1967 

Conviction: Morris' alibi fell apart after his wife Carol revoked her statement that they had been shopping

Morris was interviewed after another attempted abduction, when 10-year-old Margaret Aulton managed to escape from a man who tried to force her into his car.  

He was spoken to four times but slipped through the net when his wife Carol gave him an alibi - however, she later changed her story and became a key prosecution witness.  

Morris was found guilty of raping and murdering Christine and sentenced to life in prison, but he was never chaged with the death of Diane and Margaret.  

In 2011, Morris broke his silence insisting he was an innocent man.  

He said: 'No acquisitions of guilt can ever compensate the loss that the families involved must feel.  

'But I will always maintain that I am not responsible for the murder of Christine Darby and hopefully my fight for justice will uncover the truth.  

'I can only say over and over again, I didn't do it, and hope that someone will listen.'  

He was granted a judicial review in a bid to prove his innocence, but the review was later rejected.
