A family of six children who were torn apart by the death of their mother following a devastating house fire where they lost everything finally have something to smile about.

Larissa Monahan, 21, and her five brothers live separately since their mother, Marelle, lost her battle with pancreatic cancer last year.

Her death meant Ms Monahan now has to care for her 12-year-old brother, Siauosi, and the rest of brothers live with two different grandparents in Penrith - west of Sydney in New South Wales - and New Zealand.

The 21-year-old's other brothers are 22-year-old Lachlan, 17-year-old Keenann and 15-year-old Solomon.

The Monahan family, seen here at Christmas in 2010, lost their family home to a fire in 2011 before their mum Marelle lost her battle with pancreatic cancer last year 

Recently, the family were selected by Fiji Airways to take part in their Welcome To Our Home campaign to showcase the warm nature of Fijian hospitality, offering them their first trip overseas together.

Ms Monahan said she was grateful for the opportunity as they would not be able to afford a holiday like that for at least 10 years.

'It was just amazing to spend some quality time with each other that was uninterrupted because we only seen each other once since my mother passed,' she told Daily Mail Australia.

'It was nice to be with the boys…and to have quality time.

'The opportunity was astounding I've never expected anyone to do that for us, you just do not expect for people to do that.'

Ms Monahan said it had been very tough since her mother's death because she was their role model.

'She was all of our best friend basically. She taught us to be who were and to be who we wanted to be and not let anything to stand in our way of what we truly wanted,' she said.

'It formed us into individual people rather than worry about what people would say... and love ourselves for who we are.'

But losing their mother to cancer is not the only hardship they have faced in the past few years.

In 2011, the family lost everything in a house fire - just one street away from where she lives now in Penrith - while Ms Monahan's mother and three brothers were asleep inside.

'I had gone down to the shops and came back 15 minutes later and the roof and garage was on fire,' Ms Monahan said.

'The garage was converted into a room for Solomon and it started in that garage.

'My first thought was he was in there. I didn't get the keys out or anything, I just started banging on the door... I just couldn't think. 

'My first and only thought was Solomon was in there and I needed to get him out.

'[Firefighters] said if it had been five minutes or so later, my family would not have got out.'
