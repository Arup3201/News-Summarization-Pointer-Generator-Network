Police have released stomach-turning video taken from inside the disgusting home of accused North Carolina 'Satanist killer' Pazuza Algarad.

Inside the Clemmons house, behind which police uncovered two long-dead bodies from a shallow grave last month, is a virtual sea of trash, animal feces and other putrescence within walls utterly covered in pentagrams and depictions of the Devil.

The squalid scene lay behind a door covered in skulls and arcane symbols. Otherwise, the ranch-style brick home suggests none of the horrors police say took place inside and which date back as far as 2009.

Squalor: Police have released stomach-turning video taken from inside the disgusting home of accused North Carolina 'Satanist killer' Pazuza Algarad

'Satanist killers': Police charged Pazuza Algarad, 35 (right) with murder, along with 24-year-old Amber Burch (left), after they dug two bodies out of their back yard in early October

Early this past October, police dug two bodies out from the yard behind the home 35-year-old Algarad shared with his Satanist mother Cynthia Lawson and his self-proclaimed wife Amber Burch, 24.

The first victim has been identified as 37-year-old Joshua Fredrick Wetzler while the second victim has been named as Tommy Dean Welch, 36. 

Police say they wound up dead and buried in the yard in 2009.

Algarad was arrested and charged with murder October 5 after the two bodies were discovered at the house in Clemmons where neighbors say he has performed animal sacrifices and satanic rituals.

A friend claims that he had 'told everyone' about the bodies, but nobody believed him, and he described how he killed them, ate part of them and then burned the rest in a fire pit.

Burch was also charged with murder, while 28-year-old Krystal Nicole Matlock has been charged as an accessory with police alleging that she helped bury the bodies. 

Police have said they also found animal bones in the property and that more arrests as part of the investigation are possible.

After the trio were detained, Forsyth District Judge Gordon Miller assigned capital defenders to represent them.

Miller told them that if convicted, they could receive life in prison without the possibility of parole or the death penalty. They are set to appear in court on October 23.

Pentagrams: Pentagrams adorn most every wall of the Clemmons, North Carolina home the couple shared with Algarad's mom, fellow Satanist Cynthia Lawson

Filth: Trash was stacked so high in one hallway that investigators had to ascend the garbage mountain to get through

Sad: A pet lizard was dead in its tank and was among other dead critters found throughout the disgusting home

What's in there? Animal feces was scattered throughout the home. A cage (pictured) was filled with what animal droppings -- and possibly animal remains

Creepy: The home was adorned top to bottom in unsettling imagery in addition to the filth

Purtid: A bathroom was also completely trashed and featured a road safety cone

Accessory? Krystal Nicole Matlock has been charged as an accessory with police alleging that she helped bury the bodies

On the front door of the house where the skeletal remains were found was a sign warning law-enforcement not to enter.

It reads: 'No gang members allowed: anyone that dresses the same, has the same badge and call themselves the authority of the land they did not create. Below and to the right is a picture of a skull and cross bones.

Under that picture are the words, 'Evil will triumph'.

According to the Winston-Salem Journal, Algarad was born in San Francisco, California, as John Lawson, but dropped out of high school, became a drug dealer.

His mother Cynthia Lawson, who is also a Satanist, changed his name to Pazuzu - after the devil that possessed the girl in the film The Exorcis - and claimed it was of Iraqi descent.

His tongue was split down the middle like a snake and he allegedly filed down his teeth to sharpen them.

In 2010, Algarad was convicted on a charge of accessory after the fact in the shooting death of 30-year-old Joseph Chandler.

Chandler's body was found near a river by police after his mother reported him missing that morning.

According to state records, Algarad was on probation at the time the bodies were found.

Bianca Heath claimed she lived with Algarad for a month in 2005, and that he had spoken of the bones in his back yard.

She told The Huffington Post: 'Paz told everyone. But I never believed him. I'm sure no one else believed him either. He laughed about the skeletal remains when telling the story on why he did what he did.'

Heath said Algarad told her he picked up two prostitutes at two separate locations before he killed and ate them, burning the remains in a fire pit before burying the rest.

In 2011, Burch was accused of slapping Algarad's mother in the face and attempting to choke her.

She is described as Algarad's wife on Facebook, but authorities have said there is no legal document to suggest they are together.
