Busted: Leo Sharp was a drug courier and known as 'grandad' to the Sinaloa cartel

An 89-year-old drug mule for the notorious Sinaloa cartel known as 'old man' who hauled cocaine across the country should be spared prison because of his dementia his attorney said on Tuesday.

World War II veteran Leo Sharp, is due back in Detroit federal court on his 90th birthday on May 7 for sentencing after being caught in 2011 with $3 million of drugs belonging to the Mexican cartel on Interstate 94.

His attorney filed an 18-page sentencing memo, hoping to persuade a judge that home confinement would be appropriate for the Michigan City, Indiana resident.

'He is a colorful, self-made, charitable man who has worked hard throughout this entire admirable, extraordinary, and long life,' Darryl Goldberg wrote.

'Mr. Sharp made a monumental mistake at a moment of perceived financial weakness, and was exploited and threatened, but his conduct in this case was truly an aberration from a law-abiding life.'

He admitted he was responsible for transporting more than 1,400 pounds of drugs that originated in Arizona. The government said it has evidence that Sharp was transporting marijuana and cocaine from the West Coast back in 2000.

'Mr. Sharp is dreadfully sorry,' Goldberg said.

In preparation for the sentencing hearing, Sharp told court officials that he needed money. He said he was threatened when he tried to stop transporting drugs.

Sharp was diagnosed with dementia and other health problems and would be an expensive burden on the government if sent to prison, Goldberg said.

He is a World War II veteran who fought in Italy and was awarded the Bronze Star, the fourth-highest honor, for his service, Goldberg said.

Sharp was arrested in October 2011 following a routine traffic stop.

When the trooper asked Sharp if he could search the truck, the octogenarian refused. So the trooper requested a backup unit with a dog trained to detect bombs and illegal drugs.

As the animal walked around the rear of Sharp's truck, it alerted to the possible presence of narcotics, the complaint said.

During a subsequent search of the truck bed, troopers found 104 bricks of cocaine stashed in five bags with a wholesale value of $2.9million.

The married father-of-three made a highly amusing appearance at the court hearing, telling the judge he lost his hearing after a cannon fired close to him during the 'war'.

When he was told he would have to take a drug test, he said: 'I've never used a drug in my life. Ever.'

Sharp was charged with conspiracy and possession with intent to distribute cocaine. If convicted, he faces at least ten years in prison.
