A fifth of Britons would sacrifice a finger to achieve the perfect body shape, a survey says.

As many prepare for New Year's fad diets, the research found a fifth of adults have skipped meals to try to lose weight and a quarter admit they struggle to keep up exercise and diet regimens.

And our fixation is growing, with the word ‘diet’ mentioned more than 1,200 times in the Press in the first five days of January 2014 - 43 per cent up on 2013 and 66 per cent more than 2012.

There's got to be an easier way... A fifth of Britons would cut off their finger for a body like this, a survey says

The national body confidence campaign, Be Real, which commissioned the survey of 2,000 adults, said Britons are 'bombarded' with idealised images of celebrities and models, driving many into depression and despair.

It is urging people to avoid fad diets this New Year and focus on living healthier lives instead.

Conservative MP Caroline Nokes, chairwoman of Be Real, said: 'People are increasingly obsessed with diets.

'But actually, at the same time as a nation we are getting bigger. It is obviously a fixation that doesn’t work.

'The sad reality is that somebody of any age can become fixated about dieting to achieve the perfect body.

'But young women are likely to be more affected by it and feel greater pressure than other sectors of the population.'

Sales of bread are falling faster than those of any other supermarket product, as more and more shoppers move towards low-carbohydrate diets.

Supermarket bread sales fell by 8.9 per cent last year, with the traditional staple food increasingly being seen as fuelling weight gain.

Yesterday the Mail reported that this same trend for high-protein, low-carb diets has triggered a fall in pasta sales.

The typical white-sliced loaf, popular since the Sixties, has also been losing out to more exotic alternatives such as soft flatbread wraps.

At the same time, TV shows such as the Great British Bake-Off have encouraged people to make their own.

Bread has always had a special appeal to the British, initially as a staple food of the poor, through to the sandwich.

Ms Nokes, who is also chairwoman of the All Party Parliamentary Group on Body Image, said a fixation with how we look is also affecting young children.

'It is incredibly sad. The obsession we have with achieving the perfect body is affecting children, not just teenagers but pre-teens,' she said.

'I realise there is a real problem with obesity. But I am far from convinced that fat shaming and demonising people and promoting fad diets is the right way of countering that.

'We need to increase people’s self esteem.'

The research found that in many cases attempts to lose weight proved fruitless: a third say they have returned to their previous weight after dieting.

Charlotte Dickens, a GP and chairwoman of the campaign’s health committee, said people are risking their health striving for unachievable perfection.

She said some university students are getting so depressed because of body confidence issues they do not want to go to lectures.

'Many of my patients are young people at a London university, and we are seeing increasing levels of dissatisfaction about how people look and the importance they place on it,' she said.

'There are eating disorders, but also anxiety and depression which is stopping people going out to lectures because they are unhappy with the way they look.

'It is having a big impact on their ability to live and work and be happy.'

Holli Rubin, a psychotherapist specialising in body image, said: 'Dieting and losing weight top the New Year’s resolutions lists every year and the pressure this causes often means we’re setting ourselves up to fail.

'The cycle of dieting is very hard to break and very bad for our general health and well being. '

Be Real is a campaign to change attitudes to body image, and includes schools, businesses and charities.
