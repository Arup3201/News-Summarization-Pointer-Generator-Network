Risk: The head of the Inspired Gaming Group was one of 20 business leaders handpicked to join Mr Osborne on the trip

Chancellor George Osborne is facing questions over why he took a betting firm tycoon on a trip to China.

Luke Alvarez, a boss of one of the world’s biggest makers of betting machines, was taken on a trade mission to the superpower.

The head of the Inspired Gaming Group was one of 20 business leaders handpicked to join Mr Osborne on the trip.

His firm supplies nearly half of Britain’s 34,000 Fixed Odds Betting Terminals (FOBTs).

But campaigners against the machines - known as the ‘crack cocaine’ of the casino industry - condemned the invitation.

Matt Zarb-Cousins of the Campaign for Fairer Gambling said: ‘Mr Cameron might say he’s concerned about FOBTs but he appears to care more about the profits of the firm that makes them.

‘The Government should protect people from addictive gambling products rather than the interest of the betting industry.’

Labour MP Tom Watson said: ‘Everyone was surprised when the government was unresponsive to call for reform of FOBTs. Now we know why - they were too busy jet-setting with the makers of the machines.

‘We used to be famed around the world for our manufacturing but now George Osborne takes the makes of digital roulette machines on international trade missions.’

There was no answer to the Daily Mail’s phone calls to the Inspired Gaming Group yesterday.

The trade visit to China in October was designed to ‘showcase the best of Britain’s digital technology industry, strengthen ties between British and Chinese companies and help British companies gain access to the fast-expanding Chinese market’.

Mr Alvarez has won two deals to supply fixed odds football and lottery games to China, according to the Sunday People.

The rise of FOBTs across British high streets has alarmed residents and anti-gambling campaigners.

While the industry has denied that it is targeting poorer communities, there is concern that punters can lose up to £300 a minute in the machines.

The Prime Minister recently admitted FOBTs were ‘a problem’ and called for cross party support for action when a review of the dangers reports back in the Spring.

Labour leader Ed Miliband has proposed handing new powers to local authorities to reduce the number of FOBTs in betting shops.

There is a current limit to four, though critics have said that bookies are getting away with more in a community by simply opening up new shops.

Mr Miliband also wants to increase the time between bets as he warned that the machines were ‘spreading like an epidemic’.

Labour forced a vote in the Commons last week on the plans to give councils more powers over the machines.

But the government voted down the plans by 314 to 232, majority 82.

Culture Minster Helen Grant has said the UK’s five largest bookmakers will make changes to the way the machines operate from March.

The Minister has said bookmakers must take immediate action to increase protection for players.

She said the government was waiting for the findings of a study into how the machines are used and their impact on players before deciding what further action needed to be taken.

According to the Gambling Commission, there are close to 34,000 fixed odds terminals making over £1.2 billion every year.

Mr Cameron has blamed Labour for the rise of the machines, noting they were ‘introduced in 2001 after the [last] Government had relaxed gambling regulations’.
