A grieving mother who went missing for more than a week after she went walking on the anniversary of her daughter's death has come home after her devastated family appealed for her.

Sylvia Britton-Prior, 50, and son Adam Britton-Prior Junior, 21, had a tearful reunion following his frantic appeal for her whereabouts.

Mrs Britton-Prior, who lost her daughter Amber, 29, in a tragic road crash three years ago, got in touch after reading how concerned her family were.

She rang her brother, who then shared the good news that she was safe and well with the rest of the family.

Mrs Britton-Prior had been staying 
with an old friend in Botley, Hampshire, who then drove her to see 
relatives for an emotional catch-up.

Mr Britton-Prior Jnr, who is staying 
with his paternal grandad in Portswood, Southampton, said: 'I'm over the
moon to have Mum back with us - we are all massively relieved.

'She got in touch as soon as she read about how worried we all were, and says she wasn't thinking straight when she went missing.

'When I saw her again I just gave her the biggest bear hug I have ever given in my life and we were both close to tears.

'Once I could speak, I said 'Mum, what on earth were you playing at?' and she replied that she hadn't been thinking properly.

Agitated: Sylvia Britton-Prior's son Adam, 21, and the rest of his family were 'worried sick' about his mother who disappeared for a week

'Mum's been through a lot in the last few years and it's a huge relief to know that she's safe and well.

'She says she was in a bit of a state last week and felt like she needed a break, a breather.'

Mrs Britton-Prior, who had six children including Amber, vanished on March 25.

She says after leaving Mr 
Britton-Prior Jnr's grandad's house she 'just kept walking', hurt her 
ankle and bumped into an old friend.

He took care of her at his home for the week.

Mr Britton-Prior Jnr, who works at a recycling company, added: 'When Mum starts walking she will keep going for miles.

'After I'd seen her, we went round to
visit her six sisters and brother, and some of their children - there's
been an awful lot of hugging going on.

'I rang my dad, brothers and sisters 
to let them know and they were all so glad to hear Mum was safe too. 
It's a huge relief to have her back.'

Amber was killed when she collided with an articulated lorry while cycling to work in the city in March 2010.

Her mother had returned to the city 
to remember her eldest daughter with relatives and friends, but suddenly
disappeared at around 9am on Monday March 25.

Her son Adam Britton-Prior, from 
Nottingham, who had travelled to Southampton along with his mother and 
his father Adam Sr on the annual pilgrimage to Amber's grave, said the 
family were 'worried sick' when his mother went missing.

The 21-year-old, a site operator at a
recycling company, made an emotional appeal for anyone who might 
have seen his mother to come forward.

He had described how Mrs Britton-Prior had laid flowers on her beloved daughter's resting place.

'We all went to put some flowers at Amber's grave, like we do every year,' he said.

'Very often we will stick around and spend ages there, to be close to Amber.

'But
this year Mum didn't seem too well when we went down to the grave - you
could see there was a tear in her eye but she couldn't stick around. I think the grief hit her for some reason.'

The
group returned to a relative's house and Mr Britton-Prior travelled 
back up north without his mother, who said she wanted to stay longer.

He said Ms Mattingley's death had hit their mother badly and that her grief was compounded when she lost her own mother the following year. Her father had died when she was young.

Mrs Britton-Prior, nee Mattingley, grew up in Southampton, and her six sisters and one brother still live in the area.

Her son had put up posters around the city appealing for information on her whereabouts, with the support of a bus company and local taxi firm.

Amber Mattingley was riding to her cleaning job at a fire station in a cycle lane before the fatal crash on March 23 2010, while wearing headphones.

Investigators could not rule out the possibility she was listening to music, something her mother had warned her not to do.
