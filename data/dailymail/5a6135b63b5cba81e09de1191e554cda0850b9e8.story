Suicide attempt: Convicted killer Steven Hayes, 50, overdosed on medication on Monday

Steven Hayes, one of two convicts sentenced to death for the 2007 Connecticut home invasion of the Petit family, sent a local newspaper a suicide note before his failed suicide attempt this week, it has emerged.

Hayes was found unresponsive in his cell at the Northern Correctional Institution in Somers on Monday morning after he apparently saved up prescribed medication and took it all at once.

He was discovered by a guard during a routine check and officials said that he was continuing to recover at the University of Connecticut Health Center in Farmington on Wednesday.

Now it has emerged that the 50-year-old killer, who has attempted to kill himself on previous occasions in the past, sent a suicide note to the Hartford Courant ahead of the suicide attempt detailing his 'intolerable' prison conditions and the guilt he felt over the murders.

He is on death row for the July 
23, 2007, killings of a woman and her two daughters after a night of 
torment inside their suburban Cheshire home. The woman's husband, 
William Petit, escaped.

'I feel genuine guilt and remorse for 
my crime and past behavior,' Hayes wrote in the letter, which was dated March 6. The Courant received it Wednesday, two days after the failed attempt.

'Not a day goes by where I do 
not get emotional and cry when I reflect on what I did.

Steven Hayes' suicide note was dated March 6 and received by the Hartford Courant on March 12, 2 days after he tried to kill himself. See below for excerpts:

'As you know I am dead by suicide. [The Department of Corrections] will attempt to blame unresolved issues and anger due to my crime and past actions. This is NOT why I chose to die.

'Northern [Correctional Institution] is a psychological torture chamber. Not all but many staff enjoy the infliction of torment both physical and mental... It is these conditions that caused me to take my life.

'I feel genuine guilt and remorse for 
my crime and past behavior

'Not a day goes by where I do not get emotional and cry when I reflect on what I did. However I am okay with this because I am suppose to feel this pain. It proves I am human and not a monster. I used to believe I was a monster but a true monster would not feel bad @ causing pain and suffering. I feel bad. I can thank DOC staff for showing me the difference."

'However I am 
okay with this because I am suppose to feel this pain. It proves I am 
human and not a monster I used to believe I was a monster but a true 
monster would not feel bad @causing pain and suffering. I feel bad. I 
can thank DOC staff for showing me the difference.'

He stated that he was miserable at the prison, which he called 'a psychological torture chamber'.

He said that staff would no doubt blame his suicide on 'unresolved issues' rather than on themselves.

In 2012, he filed a civil rights complaint charging harassment, cruelty, unfair punishment and mail tampering by state prison officials - and he said these conditions were the reason for killing himself.

Correction officials denied Hayes' allegations in a court filing in June 2013.

Most recently, Hayes was disciplined in an incident over a towel and the level of discipline was not appropriate, according to his public defender.

Prison officials had cleared out his cell while he was in the shower and put his possessions on a table, and noticed that he had an extra blanket.

Hayes refused to return to the cell until he was given the blanket back.

A supervisor had given him permission to have the extra blanket, Public Defender Thomas Ullman told the Courant.

Shocking: Hayes raped and strangled Jennifer Hawke-Petit. Her daughters, Hayley, 17, and Michaela, 11, died of smoke inhalation after they were doused with gasoline and the house was set on fire

He was placed in 'punitive segregation' for 15 days in January, lost telephone privileges for 45 days and visitation privileges for 30 days.

'They're pushing him into madness,' Ullmann said.

It is not the first time the killer has tried to kill himself. At his trial in 2010, he revealed he had attempted suicide both before and after the killings by slashing his wrists and trying to choke himself.

Hayes also tried to commit suicide during 
his 2010 trial and upon hearing he would face the death penalty, told a 
New Haven court 'Death, to me, will be a welcome relief.'

He also told The Hartford 
Courant in a 2012 interview that he concocted a plan to end his own life
 by obtaining oysters, to which he is deathly allergic.

He
 said he fabricated claims in letters that he killed 17 people in hopes 
that prison authorities would notify police and he could then trade 
information for food, including oysters.

Looking forward: Five years after losing his family, Dr Petit married Christine Paluf last year

Hayes
 and an accomplice, Joshua Komisarjevsky, are both on death row 
following their convictions in the 2007 triple-murder of Jennifer 
Hawke-Petit, 48, and her daughters Hayley Petit, 17, and Michaela Petit,
 11, and the beating of husband and father Dr. William Petit Jr.

The
 pair spotted Hawke-Petit at a supermarket and followed her to her home 
in Cheshire, Connecticut, where they tied up the family.

Hayes raped and
 strangled Hawke-Petit and Komisarjevsky sexually assaulted Michaela. 
Both Michaela and her sister, Hayley, were tied to their beds and died 
of smoke inhalation after the men doused the home with gas and set it on
 fire.

Connecticut
 repealed the death penalty in 2012, but the does law not apply to those
 who had already been sentenced to death. Both men are appealing their 
sentences based on the changed law.
