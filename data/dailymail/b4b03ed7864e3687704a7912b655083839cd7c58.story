This is the story of how I woke Monday to find myself the target of at least ten thousand angry Justin Bieber fans.

The story begins less than 24 hours earlier on Sunday afternoon, when I wrote an article about the online backlash ignited by the 18-year-old pop sensation's overalls, which he wore while accepting an award from Canadian Prime Minister Stephen Harper.

The outfit, along with his backwards cap and neon yellow shoes, ignited outrage on the Internet over whether his outfit was an appropriate presentation for a meeting with the prime minister.

Bieber had earlier tweeted a photo of his outfit and wrote, 'I hope you hate my style.'

Critics said it was disrespectful. Supporters said it was Bieber being Bieber and that he could wear whatever he wanted.

The Associated Press reported that he 'caused a scene' with the outfit, while Gawker.com gave him the moniker 'white trash prince' and The Atlantic called him a 'twit.'

On Monday morning I had just jumped in the shower before work when the bathroom door flung open and in marched my boyfriend, who announced that my name was 'all over the Internet' in reference to Justin Bieber.

He stuck his iPhone through the shower curtain and showed me the texts he had received from friends overnight as well as a Bieber fan page devoted to trashing my name.

I shrugged and finished showering. Then a few minutes later, curiosity got the best of me and I flipped open my laptop to Google 'Hayley Peterson and Justin Bieber.'

My jaw dropped at what I found.

My Twitter account and inbox were littered with threats from strangers, most of whom called me vile names that the Daily Mail won't let me repeat in print.

'You need to think about what you say, b****,' wrote @kidrauhl.

'F*** you,' wrote @_JmLove_.

'Watch out,' wrote another Twitter user.

Others said: 'What a c word,' 'come 
online d*****bag,' 'how do you feel about that article now f****t,' and 
'prepare for the hate you asked for.'

I didn't know whether to laugh or lock my door.

It turns out Justin Bieber had responded directly to the article I wrote in a post on Instagram, prompting his fans to  track me down online and come at me with pitchforks raised.

In Bieber's response to my article, he 
said the photo of him accepting the award from Harper was taken in an 
arena where he would be performing.

'I walked straight from my meet and greet to [the prime minister], if you "Hayley" expect me to have a change of clothes let a loan a suit at that specific time that’s crazy,' he wrote. 'Wow am i ever white trash hayley peterson lol.'

It was Gawker that branded him 'white trash prince,' but that was lost in the fray and not worth clarifying. I had been thrust to the center of the dispute over the appropriateness of Bieber's overalls, whether I liked it or not.

By mid-noon Monday, the strongly-worded 
threats from Bieber's fans continued to multiply. While the messages 
came from seemingly harmless user names such as 'NOTICE ME BIEBER!!!' 
and 'Bieber's Girlfriend,' the vitriol from some still caught me off 
guard.

Beiber's response: 'I walked straight from my meet and greet to [the prime minister], if you "Hayley" expect me to have a change of clothes let a loan a suit at that specific time that¿s crazy,' Bieber wrote. 'Wow am i ever white trash hayley peterson lol'

Before I started working for MailOnline last month, I spent a couple years in Washington as a White House correspondent and presidential campaign reporter. I thought I had grown a pretty thick skin in that job. But nothing I did prepared me for an angry band of so-called 'Bieber Beliebers.'

Perhaps most surprising, however, is that no article I wrote about President Obama or Mitt Romney ever garnered half as much attention as Justin Bieber's overalls.
