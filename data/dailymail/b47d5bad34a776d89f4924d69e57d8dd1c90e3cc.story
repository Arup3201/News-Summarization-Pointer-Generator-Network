A London-based French model who acted in a film about a hostage crisis was gunned down with her mother as they parked up outside the Kenyan mall, it emerged today.

Anne Dechauffour, 27, and her mother Corinne, 54, were shot in their car as Islamic militants stormed the shopping centre in Nairobi.

Their deaths are among a number of heartbreaking stories that are emerging from the terror atrocity that has seen at least 61 innocent shoppers killed since it began on Saturday.

Cut down in her prime: London-based French model Anne Dechauffour who was shot dead by Islamic militants with her mother as they parked outside the Westgate shopping centre in Nairobi

Cruel irony: Anne had appeared in a short film about a hostage crisis before her death

According to reports, Anne had been visiting her mother, an artist who had remarried and settled in Kenya ten years ago.

Her father, Michel, is believed to run a luxury hotel, the Rock Leopard Lodge, in Kenya's Meru National Park.

Anne had appeared in a short film about a hostage-taking before her death, it was reported in The Times.

She was a student in cinema and linguistic sciences and was working part-time as a model.

Francois Hoffman, director of the Cours Florent drama school, told Le Parisien: 'She had potential. She had a fragility that felt like an extension of childhood.' 

The murder of the two women, who were from Nice on the French Riviera, has caused outrage in France.

Operation: Kenyan soldiers move in formation, clearing the top floor balcony and interior of the Nairobi mall

Out in force: Kenyan soldiers comb the rooftop of the Westgate mall on the fourth day of the siege

Evasive action: Kenyan soldiers and policemen crouch down behind a wall near the car park as they prepare for the next stage of the assault on the mall on Tuesday

The
 Paris based anti-terrorism bureau opened an investigation into 'murder 
and attempted murder in association with a terrorist organisation'.

Corinne's
 brother, Gabriel, was reported to have arrived in Nairobi accompanied 
by representatives of the French Foreign Ministry on Sunday.

The two women were among at least 61 civilians killed when Al Shabaab gunmen stormed the Westgate shopping centre and took a number of hostages during a five-day siege that Kenyan officials claimed had finally ended yesterday.

The number of victims, gunmen and hostages has been unclear throughout the crisis as has the progress of the operation to secure the mall.

Kenya's President tonight announced that his country had 'ashamed and defeated' its attackers, but even as he spoke shots were heard inside the mall.

Gunshots also rang out this morning, but government spokesman Manoah Esipisu said they came from Kenyan forces going room to room, firing protectively before entering unknown territory.

Victim: Dr Juan Ortiz-Iruri, whose daughter Juanita survived the mall attack by playing dead next to his body after he was shot by terrorists

A 13-year-old girl survived the mall massacre by pretending to be dead next to her father's corpse.

Dr Juan Jesus Ortiz-Iruri had just pulled up in a basement car park under the shopping centre when he was shot in the chest.

His daughter, Juanita Ortiz, sustained gunshot wounds to her leg and hand, but managed to evade a possible follow-up hit by lying still for up to four hours.

Her brother Luis, who flew to Kenya from Australia, told The Times: 'For a couple of hours, maybe four, she sat in the car until someone came and got her and carried her into an ambulance.

'They left my father because he was dead.'

Dr Ortiz-Iruri had recently been offered a job as a senior technical adviser in the Centre of Maternal and Newborn Health at the Liverpool School of Tropical Medicine.

The family was due to leave Kenya today and Juanita was reportedly excited about moving to England.

A father taken hostage at the mall sent a chilling final text to his nephew asking him to look after his one-year-old daughter.

Lorry driver Thomas Otieno, 29, phoned his parents on Saturday to say his life was in danger.

The next the family heard was a text he sent to Michael Wasonga two days later saying: 'Pray for me, that I will come out alive and meet another day.'

In another message he listed his estate, including 30,000 Kenyan shillings (£214) in his bank account, a motorbike and two cows.

A final text asked Mr Wasonga to care for this daughter.

Mr Wasonga, 30, told The Times: 'After that, I knew he wasn't going to come out.'

Kofi Awoonor was a Ghanaian poet, professor and former ambassador to Brazil, Cuba and the United Nations. 

Ghana's ministry of information said Awoonor's son was injured and is responding to treatment. Awoonor's work drew its inspiration from the traditions of his native Ewe tribe. 

Ghana's poetry foundation said on its website that Awoonor went into exile after Ghana's first president, Kwame Nkrumah, was driven out in a coup in 1966.

He returned to Ghana and was later jailed for his alleged involvement in a coup plot. 

His time in prison was recounted in The House by the Sea (1978), the foundation said.
