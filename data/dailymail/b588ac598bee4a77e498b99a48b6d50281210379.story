Treve's racing career appears to be over after her owner's racing manager said she would probably be at Sheik Joaan Al Thani's French stud in little over three weeks.

Trainer Criquette Head-Maarek had floated the possibility of one final run for the dual Prix de L'Arc de Triomphe winner in either the Breeders' or Melbourne Cup immediately after the filly's dramatic triumph at Longchamp on Sunday.

But the proposal never seemed more than wishful thinking and Harry Herbert, spokesman for the Sheik Al Shaqab racing admitted as much.

Herbert said: 'It is almost certain she will be retired. She has done enough and has nothing to prove. To win the Arc twice is remarkable.

'She has come out of the race well and is 100 per cent this morning. I imagine she will go to the Sheik's (Normandy) stud Bouquetot in about three weeks.'

Treve's Arc win was all the more dramatic coming after what had previously been a winless and disappointing season but Head-Maarek always retained faith in her filly.

Herbert added that although no firm plans for which stallion Treve will visit first had been made, there had been discussions and it will be surprising if the name Frankel didn't feature in those talks.

Treve's success completed a great weekend for Sheik Joaan when the only major disappointment was the last place of his John Quinn-trained The Wow Signal in the Prix Jean Luc Lagardere.

His colours were also carried to success at Newmarket by Osaila at Ascot, by Al Thakira and by Richard Hannon's Olympic Glory in the Prix de La Foret at Longchamp Olympic Glory is also destined for stud and only seems likely to run again if the ground for Champions Day at Ascot turns soft and he has to stand in for stablemate Toronado in the Queen Elizabeth II Stakes.

In the aftermath of Treve's 2013 Arc win, the Sheik broke records by paying £5.25million for a Galileo yearling filly subsequently named Al Naamah at the premier Tattersalls sales in Newmarket.

Those sales start again today and Tattersalls will be hoping the cash will again by flying.

Herbert said: 'The Sheik has no plans to be there but his team will be.'
