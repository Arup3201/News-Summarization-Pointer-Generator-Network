Marco Reus scored one goal and set up another as Borussia Dortmund recovered from going a goal behind in 53 seconds to beat Mainz and climb out of the Bundesliga drop zone. 

Germany international midfielder Reus was cheered by home fans for signing a new deal on Tuesday, but the celebrations were cut short when Elkin Soto opened the scoring in the first minute.

Goalkeeper Roman Weidenfeller failed to clear and Soto lobbed the ball into an empty net from the edge of the box.

Reus almost equalised a minute later in a furious start to the game but his powerful shot rattled the post.

Mainz's reserve keeper Stefanos Kapino, making his first Bundesliga start, did well to deny Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang but Neven Subotic levelled five minutes after the restart.

The Serbian defender beat his marker to head in a corner and spark wild celebrations among the home fans who had whistled the team off at halftime. 

Dortmund, who take on Juventus in the Champions League last 16 later this month, then turned the game around with Reus charging through to beat Kapino after Kevin Kampl's fine assist.

Lebanese Yunus Malli beat Weidenfeller to equalise in the 56th minute and again stun the 80,000 crowd.

Reus, though, came to the rescue for Dortmund as he delivered a superb curling pass to beat the offside trap and send Aubameyang through to make it 3-2 in the 71st minute.

Nuri Sahin's 78th minute goal sealed Dortmund's win and gave coach Juergen Klopp's team their second consecutive victory in the league and lifted them into 14th spot with 22 points.  

'Consistency is important now,' Dortmund coach Juergen Klopp after his side's second consecutive win. 

Dortmund sporting director Michael Zorc added: 'It was difficult after going behind in the first minute to a goal that belongs in a comedy routine.

'When you concede two goals from set pieces you can't win in Dortmund. It shouldn't happen,' said Mainz coach Kasper Hjulmand, whose side has only one win from 13 league games.
