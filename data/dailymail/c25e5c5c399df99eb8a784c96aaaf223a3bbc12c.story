When Frank Cattrall damaged his car driving over a pothole, he decided that the council should foot the repair bill.

But rather than admit fault, officials said they knew nothing of the hole and said his poor driving must have been to blame.

They dismissed the 62-year-old grandfather’s claim that they should pay the £500 bill to fix the wrecked suspension on his Renault Espace.

But Mr Cattrall suspected he was being fobbed off and resolved to find out whether the council was telling him the truth.

Using
 a Freedom of Information request, he found out that a council worker 
had reported the 18in by 6in hole during an inspection three months 
earlier – but the council had ignored it.

The hole was even recorded as a priority case that should be repaired within 28 days, but it was never fixed.

He thought that this evidence should be enough to force the council to soften its stance.

But
 even after Mr Cattrall, a retired BT project manager, told Essex County
 Council of his findings, it still refused to pay up – and the 
disagreement went to the small claims court.

At
 a hearing at Colchester County Court, a judge ruled in favour of Mr 
Cattrall and ordered the council to refund him £500, plus costs of £115.

Mr
 Cattrall, who has been nicknamed ‘Mr Pothole’ by his friends, last 
night told the Mail he hopes his win will inspire other drivers to make 
claims.

His ordeal began when he  struck the unfilled hole around a mile from his home in Colchester one rainy night last April.

‘I
 think the council works on the basis that a lot of drivers will just 
throw their hands up in despair at all the obstacles which are put in 
their way and just forget about it as people just don’t want the 
hassle,’ he said.

‘I have 
had phone calls and texts saying “well done” since I won the court case 
and hopefully more people will now do the same.’

He
 said the council had claimed the road was in a ‘reasonable condition – 
but I knew different and anybody who had driven on the road knew the 
truth’.

Mr Cattrall, who is 
married to Yvonne, 62 and has three grown-up children, said he would now
 try to find out how much money the council spent fighting the case 
instead of just paying up.

‘On
 the night it happened, it was pitch black and it was raining so the 
potholes were full of water – I did not have a chance. I heard the bang 
and realised there might be a problem as the car was not right,’ he 
said.

‘My garage gave me the bad news that I had a broken suspension arm so it was a major repair job.

‘Had it been a cyclist or motorcyclist who went down into that pothole, they could have  been killed.’

An
 Essex County Council spokesman said: ‘We felt we had a valid statutory 
defence to the claim, but the court disagreed and found for the 
claimant.’

In November last
 year, the council faced embarrassment after the councillor responsible 
for highways admitted he himself had applied for compensation three 
years earlier from the authority after his car hit a pothole.

Rodney
 Bass, who took up his role in May last year, paid £250 for repairs 
after the exhaust clamp broke off his Jaguar XK convertible, but his 
claim for compensation was rejected.

There
 are currently thought to be around 200,000 potholes in need of 
attention across British roads but the recent severe wet weather and 
freezing conditions are expected to make the problem worse.

Insurance
 company Warranty Direct this week estimated that the annual repair bill
 for damage caused by potholes has increased by 150 per cent in the past
 three years to £730million.

Essex County Council’s highways chief applied for compensation from his own authority after his Jaguar XK convertible hit a pothole - and was refused.

Rodney Bass, 67, who took over responsibility for highways in May last year, asked the authority for compensation three years ago when the exhaust clamp broke off his Jaguar XK convertible.

He
 said: 'I submitted a claim to Essex County Council, but it was rebutted.

'I can empathise with those who do damage their cars, it is very irritating, but it is something we have to live with.

'These things happen and you have to grin and bear it.

'We have to have our eyes open all the time when we are driving.'

Mr
 Bass has since replaced the car, and said he does not interfere 
with the claims procedure as a cabinet member for highways.

Rules
 state if a road defect has been drawn to the council’s attention, is 
classed as severe and has not been repaired, a claim for compensation 
can be made for any damage caused.

In Mr Bass’s case, the problem had not been reported to County Hall.

He
 said last November: 'The council’s claims record is very good, or very bad if you are
 a driver. Our ability to defend claims is very good, and this means we 
are actually inspecting and taking remedial action on severe potholes 
quickly.

'If someone has 
damaged their vehicle they will know if we have inspected the defect and
 how serious it is by whether it has orange paint, which is a priority 
and should be dealt with within 28 days, or purple paint, which means it
 is less serious.'
