Police are still frantically searching for a five-day-old baby who went missing in the middle of the night from the room where his mother and father lay sleeping.

Brianna Marshall, 18, discovered her newborn son Kayden Powell had vanished from their home in the Town of Beloit, Wisconsin, in the early hours of Thursday.

Officers arrested 'person of interest' Kristen Smith, who is believed to be a stepsister of Miss Marshall, several hours later in the neighboring state of Iowa. The woman is no longer considered as suspect in the case but is being held on separate fraud charges. 

Missing: Kayden Powell, now five-days-old, disappeared from his bassinet in the early hours of Thursday at a home in Beloit, Wisconsin

Birth: Brianna Marshall, 18, gave birth Kayden at Beloit Hospital while his father, Bruce Powell, 23, was present

Forty members of federal, state and local law enforcement agencies have now joined the search for missing Kayden, who is believed to have been snatched from his crib.

They have questioned a number of people, including Miss Powell, 18, Kayden's
 father Bruce Powell, 23, Miss Powell's brother and Kayden's great-grandmother - all of whom who were in the house 
when the baby was discovered missing.

There are currently no suspects in custody and police have few clues as to who could have taken the baby, according to WIFR.

'Obviously you know in this case, a five-day-old baby canâ€™t take care of 
itself,' said police chief Steve 
Kopp. 'We have got frigid temperatures out and it is just a frantic search
 to try to locate this baby.'

Parents: Miss Marshall, pictured with Mr Powell, discovered her newborn baby had vanished from their home in the Town of Beloit, Wisconsin, at 4.30am. The couple had been sleeping in the same room as their son, Kayden

Miss Marshall and Mr Powell, were 
sleeping in the same room as their son when they discovered he was missing at about 4.30am.

Miss Marshall then raised the alarm by calling 911, said Chief Kopp.

Police say there were no signs of forced entry at the house, which is currently being processed as a crime scene.

A 'person of interest' - believed to be a stepsister of Miss Marshall - was 
arrested on Thursday afternoon in Iowa on a warrant issued out of Texas, but police have 
since said she is not a suspect in the child's disappearance. 

Arrest: 'Person of interest' Kristin Smith was arrested in West Branch, Iowa on separate fraud charges on Thursday. She is no longer considered a person of interest in the missing baby case

Scene: Baby Kayden was snatched from his crib at this Wisconsin home yesterday morning. Police say there were no signs of forced entry at the house, which is currently being processed as a crime scene

Kristin
 Smith was arrested in West Branch on fraud charges after a warrant was 
put out for her arrest in Texas.

Alert: Miss Marshall called 911 after awaking at 4.30am and finding her newborn son was missing

She claims to be Miss Marshall's half-sister, with the women sharing the
 same father.

The women had reportedly discussed moving to Colorado, 
along with Mr Powell, after the baby was born.

Chief
 Kopp confirmed that Smith left the home around 1.30am on Thursday - before Miss Marshall reported that Kayden was missing.

Kopp said that Smith was visiting the home on Wednesday evening but left early on Thursday for Colorado where she lives.

Police were able to reach the woman on her cellphone and she pulled off the highway in Iowa.

Authorities took the woman into custody on an unrelated outstanding warrant from Texas.

West Branch, Iowa is 170miles from Beloit - roughly a two and a half hour drive away.

The
 homeowner of the property where Kayden and his parents were staying is listed as 
46-year-old Mark Bennett, who has a history of arrests for battery and 
criminal misdemeanors.

The FBI and Wisconsin Department of Justice are helping local authorities in the search in Rock County.

The Rock County Sheriff's Office had 
provided 16 staff at the scene, including all members of its detective 
bureau and its special investigations unit.

Chief Kopp says the incident is not 
believed to be a custody dispute - adding that an Amber Alert was not 
issued because the disappearance doesn't meet the criteria.

An Amber Alert is only issued if the child is at risk of serious injury
 or death and there is sufficient descriptive information of the child, 
captor or captor's vehicle.

Kayden was born at Beloit Memorial Hospital five days ago.

He is African-American, 20 
inches long, 6 pounds, with brown hair and brown eyes, according to 
police.

The Town of Beloit, home to about 7,700 people, is about 50 miles south of Madison near the Illinois border.
