Tennis player Elena Baltacha has been diagnosed with cancer of the liver aged 30.

The former British number one, who retired from the sport last year, said in a statement: 'I have recently been diagnosed with cancer of the liver.

'I'm currently undergoing treatment and fighting this illness with everything I have.'

Britain's Federation Cup captain Judy Murray said: 'Obviously this is a tough time for Bally, (her husband) Nino
 and her family but she is a such a determined, upbeat person and 
everyone around her is staying positive as well.

'I know she'll be really grateful for all the support that she's getting.'

Ukraine-born, Baltacha won 11 singles titles, reached the third round of Wimbledon in 2002
 and the same stage of the Australian Open in 2005 and 2010.

The 30-year-old from Perth, Scotland, made the announcement via Twitter.

Messages of support for the tennis player began to flood in this afternoon, with former British number one and television presenter Andrew Castle posting on Twitter 'Passing on love and best wishes to Elena'

Liver cancer is one of the deadliest forms of the disease. There are two broad categories - secondary and primary.

Primary liver cancers start in the liver, while secondary develops elsewhere in the body and then spreads to the liver. It is sometimes called metastatic cancer and is the most common type of liver cancer in the Western World.

Primary liver cancer is more common in men than in women, but it's not clear why. The condition is also more likely to affect people over the age of 60 and is rare below the age of 45.

Although primary liver cancer is relatively rare in the UK and US (it is in the top 10 most diagnosed cancers), one type, hepatoma, is the sixth most common cancer worldwide.

It is common in sub-saharan Africa and parts of Asia such as China.

Often there are no symptoms in the early stages of liver cancer. This is because the liver is capable of functioning very well when only part of it is working. Typical symptoms include tiredness, weight loss, nausea/vomiting and itchy skin.

Overall, the outlook is poor - the five-year survival rate of people with liver cancer is 16 per cent. For the 41 per cent of people who are diagnosed at an early stage, the five-year survival rate is 29 per cent.

If the cancer has spread to a distant part of the body, the five-year survival rate is 3 per cent.Many people who develop primary liver cancer are already in poor health with cirrhosis.The best chance of a cure is with surgery when the cancer is small, has not spread from the liver, and the rest of your liver is relatively healthy. However, this situation only occurs in a minority of cases.

Messages of support for the player were posted on social media this afternoon.

Former
 British number one and television presenter Andrew Castle ‏wrote: 
'Passing on love and best wishes to Elena Baltacha for a speedy 
recovery. Shocked by this news.'

Old rival Anne Keothavong, who along with Baltacha headed up the women's game for several years, ‏wrote on Twitter: 'She's one of the people I most admire for her courage and determination. You'll fight through this.'

The official Twitter page for the Lawn Tennis association also wrote a message of support - writing: 'We’re all behind you @ElenaBaltacha. From everyone in British Tennis we send you our very best wishes.'

Helen Grant, the government minister for sport, tourism and equalities, said: 'My thoughts are with Elena Baltacha, her family and friends.'

Today, cancer charities have warned the player may need to have a liver transplant.

Andrew Langford, chief executive of the British Liver Trust, said: 'The chances are she will have known for a while that she was at risk of liver cancer because of her PSC (primary sclerosing cholangitis).

'It's a genetic illness that infects your bile duct. You get a back flow of bile into your liver and that causes scarring in your liver.

'As the liver is more scarred it will be so damaged that you will have cirrhosis.

'Normally when we talk about liver cirrhosis people think about alcohol, but this is definitely not related to alcohol.

'I would imagine she will have a range of treatments.

'It will be a very difficult time for her and it may be that she eventually needs to have a liver transplant.'

According to the British Liver Trust, liver disease is now the fifth biggest cause of death in England and Wales, after heart disease, cancer, stroke and respiratory disease.

Martin Ledwick, head information nurse at Cancer Research UK, said: 'We're very sad to hear Elena has been diagnosed with liver cancer.

'If anyone has questions about the disease, or any other type of cancer, they can visit our website or call our team of cancer nurses free on 0808 800 40 40.'

Born in Kiev, Ukraine, Baltacha comes from a sporting family.

Her father is footballer Sergei Baltacha - who represented the Soviet Union and played in the United Kingdom for Ipswich Town, St. Johnstone and Inverness Caledonian Thistle.

Her brother Sergei is also a footballer - who played for St Mirren and Millwall.

Baltacha was born in Kiev, Ukraine, and moved to Ipswich when her father - footballer Sergei - was transferred to play for Ipswich in 1989

Baltacha greets Queen Elizabeth II as she attends the Wimbledon in 2010. The player was diagnosed with primary sclerosing cholangitis - a chronic liver condition - aged 19

Her mother Olga represented the Soviet Union at Olympic level in both the heptathlon and pentathlon.

She came to Britain with her family aged six when her father was transferred to Ipswich in 1989.

At the age of 19 Baltacha was diagnosed with primary sclerosing cholangitis - a chronic liver condition which affects the immune system.

Despite her illness, she went on to win 11 singles titles - managing the condition throughout her professional career with medication and regular blood tests.

She reached the third round of Wimbledon in 2002. She got to the same stage of the Australian Open twice - in 2005 and 2010.

It was in 2010 she reached a career-high world ranking of 49. She was British number one for 132 weeks between 2009 and 2012.

However, she struggled with injury and illness during her career and retired from the sport in November last year.

Following
 the announcement, she revealed she planned to dedicate herself to 
coaching and developing the academy she founded in 2012 with her coach 
Nino Severino.

She said at the time: 'I
 still absolutely love tennis and I want to take that passion and put it
 into learning to be the best coach I can be so that I can take all my 
experiences as a player and use that to help develop the next generation
 of British tennis players.'

Due to her medical history, she has been a patron of the Children's Liver Disease Foundation since 2010.

Commentators have pointed to Great Britain Davis Cup player Ross Hutchins as the player's inspiration.
