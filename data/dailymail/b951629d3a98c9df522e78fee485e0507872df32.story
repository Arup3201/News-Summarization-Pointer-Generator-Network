Cramps: A Russian MP has proposed a new law giving women two paid days off a month for while they are on their periods

Women's rights activists in Russia have reacted with anger to proposals to give women two days paid leave a month when they are on their periods.

Mikhail Degtyaryov, a member of the nationalist LDPR party, wrote on his website that he had proposed the draft law to increase the protection of women at the workplace.

'During that period, most women experience psychological and physiological discomfort,' said Mr Degtyaryov, 32, who is married with two sons.

'The pain for the fair sex is often so intense that it is necessary to call an ambulance.'

Human rights campaigners have already dismissed Mr Degtyaryov's idea as sexist.

'This argument is obviously improper, unreasonable and nothing close to being serious,' said Anna Sobko, a lawyer at Memorial, Russia's oldest human rights group.

Marina Pisklakova-Parker, head of women's group Anna Center, said the proposal was absurd.

'If we are seriously debating women's efficiency at work during menstruation, we should also consider how fit for work men are after a drinking bout,' she said.

Rights activists said they did not see the Kremlin's hand behind the proposal.

But opponents of the Russian government say there has been a drift towards more conservatism attitudes in Russian politics since Putin returned to the presidency last year and started courting the resurgent Russian Orthodox Church.

Parliament has since then enacted what critics see as a series of repressive laws, including one banning 'homosexual propaganda' which has been widely condemned in the West.
