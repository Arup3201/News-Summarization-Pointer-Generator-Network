A grieving twin has pledged to complete the bucket list her sister never could - and demands on it include going to a gay bar, getting arrested, and 'farting loudly in a lift'.

Cystic fibrosis sufferer Nicole Tennant, 21, had been preparing for a life-changing double lung transplant last month when she took an unexpected turn.

Her twin Melissa was in Marbella when she got the call saying Nicole had just hours to live. She rushed back to Gartnavel Hospital in Glasgow in time to say a final goodbye.

Wicked sense of humour: Nicole Tennant, who died last month aged 21, and wrote a bucket list that her twin sister Melissa is planning on completing for her

Now Melissa is determined to complete her sister's 57 bucket list wishes, which includes getting tattoos, jumping out of a plane and posing naked for a life art class.

She has already bought a pair of shoes worth more than £100 - some pink strappy high-heels from Dune - and named a star Nicole Tennant.

Melissa said: 'Nicole wrote down so many things she wanted to do but her illness didn't allow her to do them.

'It's funny how many of them involved nudity! But that was Nicole - she loved a laugh.

'One thing I don't do is heights so I won't be jumping out of any planes, but I'll do everything else I can.

'I've had friends and family, some overseas in Canada and New Zealand, get in touch to say they want to help, which is just as well.'

Doing it for my sister: Melissa Tennant is planning on carrying out everything on the bucket list of her late sister Nicole

The girls' father Stewart, 59, said: 'I think Nicole was a wee bit fly when making that list.

'It's as if she knew she wouldn't manage to do all of those things herself and that Melissa would end up taking it on. She had a wicked sense of humour.'

When Melissa made it to the hospital Nicole was already unconscious.

Melissa said: 'She could hear me, she definitely could. I said "I love you" and she twitched. She knew better than to die before I got back to see her one more time.

'Nicole was diagnosed with cystic fibrosis as a baby but all the way through primary we were very similar.

'It was in high school that our lives became very different. She was in and out of hospital and taking up to 30 pills a day and on oxygen 24/7. Our parents bought a camcorder to take with us on holiday when we were five and there's footage of Nicole singing Al Jolson songs, flinging back her feeding tube as if it was her hair.

'That's what she was like. She was positive and funny and tried to make us all feel good.'

The family also hope to start a trust fund in Nicole's name to support young cystic fibrosis sufferers and their families.

Their mother Agnes, 56, said: 'There are no respite centres for cystic fibrosis sufferers in Scotland, and I know it would have really helped us when Nicole was unwell.'

Once charitable status has been confirmed, people will be able to donate to the trust and log on to the site to watch Melissa and her friends power through the list.
