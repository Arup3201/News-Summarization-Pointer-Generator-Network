A federal agency charged with preventing the spread of infectious diseases has come under attack for 'serious' airflow problems in one of their buildings that houses anthrax, SARS and monkeypox.

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) works to develop disease prevention and control, with particular focus on infectious diseases.

But despite harbouring lethal airborne gases new documents reveal that their building in Atlanta has a poorly engineered airflow system which could expose unprotected staff and visitors to dangerous pathogens.

Concern: The Centers for Disease Control were accused of having serious airflow problems in one of their buildings housing infectious diseases

On February 16 safety inspector Eddie Jackson sent an email to a top CDC official which said: 'As the door 
closed a very noticeable puff of air could be felt coming through the 
slit in the window out into the "clean corridor".'

ANTHRAX: Caused by the bacterium Bacillus anthracis and transported through spores, anthrax causes respiratory infection in humans. It starts with cold or flu-like symptoms which last for several days, followed by fatal respiratory collapse.

SARS: Severe acute respiratory syndrome is another respiratory disease in humans, caused by the Sars coronavirus. Resembling severe flu the virus killed 916 people between November 2002 and July 2003.

MONKEYPOX:This exotic infectious disease causes symptoms similar to small pox. Monkeypox can be transmitted to humans from infected animals and cases occur primarily in remote villages of Central and West Africa in proximity to tropical rainforests.

Under biosafety regulations imposed by the CDC itself labs housing the most dangerous 'inhalable' infectious gases must be maintained under negative pressure.

Meaning that pressure inside the room should always be less than that on the outside - ensuring that no toxic air will flow out.Â 

Dr Richard Besser, former head of the CDC Coordinating Office for Terrorism Preparedness and Emergency Response, said airflow systems serve as a final safeguard keeping dangerous germs confined to labs.

Worryingly the revelations about inadequate airflow are just the latest in a long history of botched safety procedures at the $214 million infectious diseases laboratory in Atlanta.

In 2007 backup generators failed to keep airflow systems working during a power outage reports ABC News.

While in 2008 the door to the lab housing Coxiella Burnetii - a bacterium which causes the life-threatening Q-fever - was found to be sealed with duct tape.

Nine workers were tested for the bacterium, which causes the fever, but none were infected.

Shocking: In 2008 a door to the lab housing a deadly bacterium was found to be sealed with duct tape (picture posed by model)

Congressman John Dingell said: 'This is yet another incident that calls into question CDC's self-inspection policy.'

And Dr Besser added that the airflow issue and the failure of the CDC to respond quickly highlighted the problems with self-inspection.

The CDC did not immediately respond to requests for comment.
