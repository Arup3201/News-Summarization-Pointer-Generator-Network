His daughter is barely clinging onto life after a suspected drug overdose.

But Bobby Brown appeared on a talk show today selling his barbecue sauce - and saying that Bobbi Kristina was 'doing really well'.

The pre-recorded segment of Queen Latifah was accompanied by a brief on-screen warning that the interview was 'previously recorded'.

But it was not shown throughout the segment, which was broadcast on network affiliate stations around the country. 

Daily Mail Online has reached out to Sony Pictures, which produces the Queen Latifah show to ask why it was aired. 

Warning: Viewers were told briefly when Bobby brown arrived on the Queen Latifah show that it was made before his daughter was found drowned in her bath tub 

In the course of his appearance, Brown said that his daughter was 'great' and busy working on her music.

He joked about how he doesn't like working out and said that Bobbi Kristina had 'the voice of her mother'.

But the decision to air it regardless will be seen by many to be in bad taste.

Bobbi Kristina is currently unconscious in an Atlanta hospital room after she was found unresponsive in her bathtub on January 31 in a chilling echo of how her mother Whitney Houston died.

Her family have said she is 'still fighting' but reports have claimed that she could suffer from serious brain damage if she ever manages to leave the hospital.

Pictures this week showed Brown, 46, looking forlorn with his eyes puffy beneath a beanie as he grappled with the tragedy that has befallen his family.

Promotion: Brown was on the show to push his range of barbecue sauces. But since his daughter's drowning he has been at the hospital where she is fighting for her life

But on the Queen Latifah show he seemed relaxed and in good humor.

With a smile on his face, Brown cooked some shrimp and rice for Latifah to show off his range of barbecue sauces, which he launched last summer.

Brown said: 'Smell it!

'When you smell good food, that's when you go into a place to eat, when you can smell it from outside. Fresh peppers and herbs and garlic.'

Asked how things are going with his family, Brown said: 'Everybody's great.

'Two of my sons are working on LPs. They drive me crazy, but, you know. They do their thing and I just stand to the side.

'My oldest daughter LaPrincia is still in school getting her masters and I'm so proud of her.

'Bobbi Kristina, who everybody knows, she's doing really well.

'Working on her music, I'm so proud of her. I am so proud of her. She has the voice of her mother and the legs of her father.'

Brown added that his late wife's performance album had just come out - it was released in November last year - and that he was thinking of quitting music.

He said: 'I've decided to, I don't know, the music business has gotten so strange that I plan on recording probably the last album and I'm gunna call it.

'I'm 45 years old. Forty five years old! I feel it one good last album and I want to go and sit with my grandchildren and just chill.

'You have to understand, I've been doing this for almost 35 years, my legs are tired. I love dancing and singing, it's just the workout part.

'Alright, alright, two miles is enough, to be on a treadmill and lifting weights. It's all cool to be healthy but, it's not really cool when you don't wanna do it no more.'

Brown added that he was also working on his memoirs so 'people know the truth about my life'.

Latifah's show was cancelled in December last year although new episodes were scheduled to run until the end of March.
