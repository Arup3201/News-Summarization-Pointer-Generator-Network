A British oil executive assassinated in front of his wife as they left a Brussels restaurant may have been targeted by Eastern European hitmen, it emerged last night.

Nicholas Mockford, 60, was shot three times by two men wearing motorbike helmets as he left the Italian restaurant in a suburb of the Belgian capital.

His wife of 15 years, Mary, was beaten before the two attackers escaped on a  motorbike. A local man tried to resuscitate Mr Mockford as he lay in his wife’s arms but he died on the way to hospital.

Mr Mockford, pictured here inside a boat, was reportedly the head of marketing for interim technologies for ExxonMobil Chemicals, Europe, promoting new types of greener fuel

And one line the police are believed to be investigating is whether the oil executive was connected to the world of industrial espionage.

This theory has been looked at especially as ExxonMobil have refused to release details about his work.

Details of the killing, which took place at about 10pm on October 14, were until now shrouded in secrecy because police imposed a news blackout.

One theory being considered by Belgian police is that Mr Mockford was deliberately targeted because of his work at oil giant ExxonMobil.

A source close to the investigation said the ruthless efficiency of the attack bore all the hallmarks of a professional hit by Russian or Eastern European assassins.

‘We are looking into his work dealings to see if he had any enemies or was working on anything sensitive,’ the source said.

‘Officers searched his house straight after his murder while his wife was in hospital to see if there were any clues which may identify a motive for the attack.’

Police are also considering the possibility that Mr Mockford was killed in a failed bid to steal his Lexus 4x4 car, which was parked nearby.

A witness who saw Mrs Mockford after the attack said: ‘She was clearly shocked. She said the men were demanding money and the car.’

However, the ferocity of the attack and the fact that Mr Mockford received a ‘coup de grace’ shot to the upper body as he was bleeding on the floor have prompted detectives to consider other options.

Four bullet casings were later found in the road.

One local, who asked not to be identified, said he heard a ‘Tac, tac’ noise and went out to investigate.

He said: ‘I saw a woman lying on the pavement across the street. She was shouting, “Help, help!”.

There was also a man lying next to a car.’

The witness initially thought the couple had been victims of a hit-and-run because he spotted a white van speeding away from them.

He added: ‘I tried to revive the man twice, but then he stopped breathing. I resuscitated him and he came to. Then he became unconscious again and at that moment the ambulance arrived. As the paramedics cut open the man’s clothing I saw he had a bullet in his chest and a bullet in his shoulder. There was also blood on his head.’

Mr Mockford was a department head promoting greener fuels for ExxonMobil, for whom he had worked for almost 40 years.

A neighbour claimed Mr Mockford and his Belgian wife had sold their large family home in Grimbergen, in the city’s northern suburbs, two days before the murder and were planning to retire to Thailand.

Mr Mockford had three adult children from a previous marriage, all of whom live in Britain. A keen sailor and golfer, he was brought up in Leicestershire and had last lived in this country in Chichester, but had spent several years abroad, mostly in Singapore and Belgium.

When his link to a global oil company
 emerged, police confirmed that a targeted attack on a specific 
individual was one obvious line of inquiry.

But
 a spokeswoman for ExxonMobil said that, although the death was a shock,
 there was nothing to suggest a link with the company.

She
 said: 'Mr Mockford was a department manager at our office close to 
Brussels, but we have no indication that the incident was work-related.'

A dossier has been compiled in the 
days since the execution which is understood to examine several theories
 - from a botched car theft to assassination by 
eco-terrorists angered at ExxonMobil's involvement in Nigeria and 
Afghanistan.

Organised crime linked to the oil industry in Russia has also not been ruled out.

ExxonMobil, parent company of Esso and Mobil, is a favourite villain of green activists around the world.

In June this year US investigative 
journalist Steve Coll published a mammoth 750 page book called 'Private 
Empire' about the company which showed that if it were a country, it 
would rank among the top 30 richest in the world.

Belgian websites are awash with conspiracy theories.

'A topman for an oil company ... if 
you know that oil is the main cause of war in the Middle East (and there
 so many daily deaths), then a leading man of such company is anything 
but innocent," said a blogger on the HLN.be news website.

Another contributor to the same site 
wrote: 'Carjackers don't execute someone with shots to the head, fail to
 steal the car and leave a witness alive. This has to do with the environment.'

Belgium police denied they had put a 
media blackout on the crime because it had been reported in three local 
Dutch language newspapers in the days afterwards.

But it is understood that an official
 silence on possible theories was imposed as lawmen contacted Interpol 
to try to get a possible handle on the two assassins, one of whom 
clutched a motorbike helmet as he fled.

A Belgian police source said; 'It 
could have been a carjacking gone wrong. They panicked and he died. But 
this is not the only avenue we are pursuing.'

The Belgian prosecutor’s office said 
last night a ‘judicial instruction’ had been ordered by the 
investigating judge, Martine Quintin, meaning ‘no explanation’ and 
details about the killing could be released.

Mr Mockford worked for oil company ExxonMobil, an enemy of many green activists, whose headquarters are based in Irving, Texas

A spokesman said: ‘This is usual in such a serious murder investigation.’

A Foreign Office spokeswoman said last
 night: ‘We can confirm the death of a British national on October 14 in
 Brussels and we are providing consular assistance.’

It
 is understood Mr Mockford was the head of marketing for interim 
technologies for ExxonMobil Chemicals, Europe, promoting new types of 
greener fuel.

He had worked for the company since the 1970s and had been married to his second wife, who is Belgian, for 15 years.

Belgium has a higher homicide rate than the UK, according to United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime.

In
 statistics from the year 2009, it shows that Belgium has 1.7 homicides 
per 100,000 people, compared to 1.2 in the United Kingdom.

However, Belgium reported186 homicides, compared to the UK's 722.

restaurant in Rue de Beyseghem at around 10pm

ExxonMobil has become the target of many hate campaigns.

Some environmental organisations have
 criticised the oil company for their approach to the environment, their
 work and their past handling of oil spills.

The Exxon Valdez oil spill happened 
in Prince William Sound, Alaska, on March 24, 1989, when an oil tanker 
struck a reef and spilled 260,000 to 750,000 barrels of crude oil.

The company were criticised for their 'slow response to the disaster'.

The mayor of Valdez, John Devens, is 
reported to have said his community felt betrayed by Exxon's inadequate 
response to the crisis, Wikipedia said.

More than 11,000 Alaska residents, 
along with some Exxon employees, worked throughout the region to try to 
restore the environment.

After a trial, a jury ordered Exxon 
to pay $5 billion in punitive damages, though an appeals court reduced 
that amount by half. Exxon appealed further, and on June 25, 2008, the 
United States Supreme Court lowered the amount to $500 million, The 
Seattle Times reported.

The July 2011 Yellowstone River oil 
spill came from an ExxonMobil pipeline running from Silver Tip to 
Billings, Montana, which ruptured about 10 miles west of Billings.

The devastating spill leaked an 
estimated 750 to 1,000 barrels of oil into the Yellowstone River for 
about 30 minutes before it was shut down, according to Wikipedia.

It is accused of drilling in terrains leased to them by dictatorships, such as those in Chad and Equatorial Guinea.
