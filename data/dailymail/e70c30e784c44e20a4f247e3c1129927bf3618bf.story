It was 1974 when Cilla Black last graced the Top 40 of the hit parade.

The singer who started out working in the Cavern Club in Liverpool in the early 1960s first charted with Love of the Loved, a composition by her friends John Lennon and Paul McCartney.

After 19 Top 40 hits, including a brace of chart-toppers she later moved into television as the host of Blind Date and Surprise Surprise.

Now the Liverpudlian singer has been propelled back up the charts – thanks to the success of the three-part ITV biopic.

Thousands have flocked to buy Cilla’s 1964 Number 1 smash Anyone Who Had A Heart after Sheridan Smith as Cilla, pictured, performed it on the show on Monday.

The classic track was at number 46 in the midweek chart and looks set to climb further, according to sales figures from the Official Charts Company.

The song also reached the top of the Irish charts for Cilla but failed to chart in the United States.

It was written by the legendary song-writing duo Burt Bacharach and Hal David for Dionne Warwick in November 1963. Her original recording made the Top 10 in the United States, Canada, Spain, Holland, South Africa, Belgium and Australia in January 1964.
