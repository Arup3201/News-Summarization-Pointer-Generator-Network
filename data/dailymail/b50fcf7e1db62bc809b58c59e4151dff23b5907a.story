Over his right shoulder an angry man can be seen marching up to the parked vehicle and knocking on the window. 

As the driver lowers the glass the man, who was wearing a grey hat and black jacket, can be heard screaming abuse.

He said: 'I got a kid in my f****** car and you are driving like an a******* and want to video tape me. 

'F*** you.'

Shards of glass were sent flying across the vehicle after the window was shattered 

The driver, who had up to this point remained silent, then asks: 'Is that all?'

This sparks the incensed man to send his fist crashing through the passenger window.

The GTI driver sighs and appears to smile, as the furious man stalks away.
