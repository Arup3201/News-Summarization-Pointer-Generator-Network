Axed: Judeson Peter, 39, claims that Huawei Technologies axed him 'because he was not Chinese'

A telecoms company is accused of race discrimination after axing almost 50 British workers and replacing them with Chinese employees.

Judeson Peter, 39, told an employment 
tribunal that Huawei Technologies made him redundant from their office 
in Basingstoke, Hampshire, because he was British.

The £48,000-per-year customer support engineer, who 
specialised in fibre optics, said there was 'clearly' an increasing 
number of Chinese staff at the firm.

In total, they moved 342 workers to Britain over three years, the tribunal heard.

In the same period, 49 British and non-British staff lost their jobs.

Mr Peter said: 'A large number of Chinese employees were joining the workforce in 2009 at the same time that I was being made redundant.

'I believe I could have done these 
roles. Far more non-Chinese employees have been selected for redundancy 
than Chinese employees.

'With regard to engineers, it should 
be noted that not a single Chinese engineer has been made redundant, 
whereas 30 non-Chinese have been.'

The hearing in Southampton, Hampshire, was told that Mr Peter started working for the Chinese firm in April 2006 but was made redundant in May 2009.

Mr Peter, who was born in Sri Lanka but became a British national after studying at King's College, London, in the 1990s, said no foreign workers were made redundant.

He added: 'The human resources manager sent an email dated April 21, 2009, stating that expat employees are exempt from redundancy.

'This is a clear racial discrimination against non-Chinese employees as most expats are Chinese.

'Home Office guidelines state employers are not to treat migrant workers more or less favourably than resident workers.

'I believe I have been unfairly pre-selected for redundancy and have been selected due to my age and race in that I am not Chinese.'

Mr Peter added: 'Those who were made redundant were local engineers, some British, some of other nationalities.'

Mohamed Kerrouche, a colleague of Mr Peter, said Chinese employees’ poor spoken English made it impossible for them to speak to customers.

He said: 'There were three rounds of redundancies in 2009.

'On each occasion local engineers were made redundant and either expat employees - Chinese migrant workers - or locally employed ethnically Chinese engineers were not.

'One Chinese engineer I worked with spoke very little English, hence it made it extremely difficult for me to liase with him.

Mr Peter was the most senior engineer on his team at Huawei before being made redundant.

Huawei, which has its headquarters in Guandong, China, employs 110,000 staff worldwide and made a profit of $3.64 billion last year.

Tony Cooper, representing Huawei, said the figures quoted by Mr Peter were unreliable.

He also stressed that the Chinese expats were employed by the holding company in their homeland - and not the UK firm.

Mr Cooper said: 'The Chinese expats went through a different redundancy process. They were employed by the holding company in China and seconded to work in the UK.

'They did not work for the UK-based company. The whole company was affected by economic circumstances and changes in the organisation of their competitors.'

In cross-examination, he said to Mr Peter: 'The figures you have given cannot be relied on. The numbers are not reflective of the number of visas granted or the number of people who have come to work in the UK.'

A spokesman for Huawei added: 'Huawei denies all allegations made by Judeson Peter within his employment tribunal. 'In 2009 Huawei unfortunately had to make a series of redundancies, resulting in 25 percent of British workers and 32 percent of Chinese employees losing their jobs. Huawei’s Chinese expat employees are subject to a separate contract and dealt with through a different process. The fact that a higher percentage of Chinese workers than British were made redundant shows that Huawei in no way prioritised Chinese employees.'Mr Peter was employed as an optical customer support engineer at the time of restructuring. Huawei began a fair review, strictly following selection criteria feedback. Mr Peter scored the lowest number of points, so unfortunately he had to be made redundant. Huawei believes that the process followed was fair and in line with the approach other companies operating in the UK would take to restructuring.'

Mr Peter, from Paddington, London, 
alleges unfair dismissal, breach of contract and discrimination on the 
grounds of age and race.

Huawei won the tribunal. A spokesperson for the company said: ‘The tribunal has upheld that Judeson Peter was not unfairly dismissed and that Huawei was found to have followed a fair and legal process.  Huawei as a reputable employer would not tolerate any form of discrimination in the workplace and this has been validated by the tribunal's review of the case.Huawei is a responsible and fair employer and we are committed to the equal treatment of all our employees, providing the same career opportunities to all our employees globally.'
