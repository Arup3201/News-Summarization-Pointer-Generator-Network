Thousands of history fanatics have re-enacted the Battle of Nations that led to the defeat of French emperor Napoleon's army 200 years ago.

Participants from 24 countries descended on Leipzig for the occasion and were watched by up to 30,000 people.

The mock battle featured combat re-enactments between infantrymen, cavalrymen and artillery units.

Six thousands participants donned 19th century military costumes for the commemoration to a battle that was the turning point in the Napoleonic wars.

The battle has been described as the largest seen on European soil before World War I. 

The original battle involved about 500,000 soldiers and pitted the coalition armies of Russia, Prussia, Austria, Sweden and England against the French army outside of Leipzig in 1813.

It ended in a defeat of the French army which sealed the end of Napoleon's hegemony over Europe.

About 90,000 people died on the battlefields outside of Leipzig.

History fans travelled from as far afield as Australia for the reconstruction in a field in the village of  Markkleeberg near Leipzig.

Napoleonic cavalry troops then filed past and they were met by history buffs dressed as the coalition forces.

Cannons and muskets, with fake rounds, were fired between the opposing sides, while pipers and drummers played in the background.

Re-enactor Peter Bach, 59, who played a two star general, told AFP: 'I want to show history for our young people.

'Otherwise they can only read about it in history books.'

The Battle of Nations was the bloodiest of the Napoleonic wars

The Battle of Nations, also known as the Battle of Leipzig, was the turning point in the Napoleonic wars.

It was a decisive defeat for Napoleon and he was exiled to Elba within a year. 

Some 320,000 coalition forces from Russia, Austria, Prussia and Sweden beat Napoleon's 185,000-strong French army in the conflict between October 16 and 19, 1813. 

The battle is the largest and bloodiest of the Napoleonic wars.

Between 80,000 and 110,000 soldiers were either killed, wounded of missing on both sides.

The Allies captured 15,000 Frenchmen, as well as hundreds of cannon. 

The victory marked the end of the French Empire east of the Rhine. 

The defeat was also significant for Napoleon himself as it was the first time he had lost. 

With his army depleted and morale low, coalition forces invaded France in early 1814, within months of the Battle of Nations. 

Napoleon was forced from the throne of France and was then sent in exile to the island of Elba.

The original battle involved about 500,000 soldiers, of which about 100,000 were killed outside Leipzig

The huge re-enactment took years to organise by a specially appointed historical commission.

Parisian lawyer, Frank Samson, was given the pivotal role of Napolean for the re-enactment.

The 46-year-old even taught himself the Corsican language to give extra authenticity to the performance.

The weekend of events in Leipzig began on Friday with an appeal for continued peace in Europe.

During a speech on Friday European Parliament President Martin Schulz said: 'It is with great concern that I have observed the continued spread of a "renationalization" in Europe.

'We must all do our part to prevent the return of old ways of thinking that have only ever brought misery to Europe's people,' according to AFP.
