This is the shocking moment a sea lion is sent spinning 20ft into air after being smacked by a killer whale's tail.

A group of anglers in Ketchikan, Alaska, saw one of the ocean's strongest predators in action when they filmed the sea lion being tossed in the air.

The sea lion tried to escape the 20ft mammal by hiding under a fishing boat on Friday August 15, but moved on after a few minutes.

A group of anglers in Ketchikan, Alaska, captured the moment a sea lion was thrown 20ft in the air after being knocked by a killer whale's tail

One of the anglers is heard saying: 'He's swimming the wrong way.'

As the sea lion starts swimming for his life, a powerful tail knocks him out of the water and tosses him through the air.

The startled mammal spins above the water around a dozen times in little over a second before splashing back down.

It is unknown whether the sea lion survived the ordeal.

The Anglers Adventures of Ketchikan group posted the video and said: 'This morning near Ketchikan, Alaska, a sea lion was hiding under our fishing boat because he was being stalked by a killer whale. When we decided to leave the area the whale attacked the sea lion and tossed him 20 feet into the air.'

The YouTube video has attracted more than 214,390 views.

Killer whales are sophisticated and effective predators of marine mammals and regularly attack sea lions.

Around 32 species have been recorded as killer whale prey, from examining stomach contents, scarring on the prey's body, or feeding activity.

Groups even attack larger members of the cetaceans group, including minke whales, gray whales, and rarely sperm whales or blue whales.

They use a number of clever techniques to catch their prey, including their powerful tails to disable their intended victim.

Data from Icelandic killer whales indicate that an average-size male is about 5.8m to 6.7m, 19 to 22 ft, whereas females average between 4.9m to 5.8m, 16 to 19 ft long.
