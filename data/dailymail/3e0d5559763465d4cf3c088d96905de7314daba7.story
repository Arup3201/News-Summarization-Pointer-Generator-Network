The young homeless man who accompanied Miley Cyrus to the MTV Video Music Awards, got a rebuke from an Oregon judge on Tuesday after he showed up 45 minutes late to a court hearing.

Jesse Helt, 22, made his first court appearance since turning himself in last month on a probation violation.

The aspiring model, who is free on $2500 bail, was admonished by a Polk County judge for showing up nearly an hour late and missing a first call for his name, court officials said.

The judge told Helt to 'bring a toothbrush' if he was tardy to a probation violation hearing next month that will determine whether Miley's VMA companion goes back to jail or continues on probation.

The 21-year-old singer was nowhere to be seen in court, but it looks like Helt could have used her help to get to his hearing on time.

Miley was spotted driving around Beverly Hills on a three-wheeled motorbike on Monday with her 14-year-old sister Noah gripping on to her from behind.

The two enjoyed a spin on the gunmetal-colored Can-Am Spyder motorcycle by BRP as they rode through the streets in the posh neighborhood.

According to People, the Wrecking Ball singer received the motored trike as a present for her 21st birthday last year from her father Billy Ray Cyrus. 

Helt was catapulted into the spotlight after he appeared on stage with Cyrus during the MTV Video Music Awards in Los Angeles in an effort to spread awareness about homeless youth.

Standing next to a teary-eyed Cyrus, the Salem, Oregon native said he was 'accepting this award on behalf of the 1.6 million runaways and homeless youth in the United States who are starving, lost, and scared for their lives right now.'

'I know this because I am one of these people,' he said.

Days after the award ceremony, it emerged that Helt was wanted by authorities in Oregon for violating probation after he pleaded guilty to misdemeanor criminal mischief and criminal trespass charges in 2010 for breaking into the home of a man he believed was selling bad marijuana, according to court records.

Helt was sentenced to 30 days in jail and was given probation but instead of fulfilling the latter half of the court penalty, he moved to Los Angeles where he lived on the streets as he tried to kick-start a career in show business.

Cyrus said she melt Helt while touring the Hollywood homeless center My Friend's Place.

Helt’s next court appearance is set for October 7th.
