A hospital has admitted it was to blame for the death of a baby after a horrified mother was forced to point out to midwives that her baby wasn't breathing because the umbilical cord was wrapped around her neck.

Gemma Peters, 26, was left in agony following a horrific labour at Russells Hall hospital in Dudley, West Midlands, where midwives failed to act despite her baby's head being stuck in the birth canal for 90 minutes.

And when baby Brook was finally delivered, nurses placed her straight onto her mother's chest - where terrified Miss Peters had to beg nurses to help when she noticed her newborn wasn't breathing as the umbilical cord was wrapped around her neck.

Tragic: Gemma Peters' daughter Brook's umbilical cord was wrapped around her neck and she wasn't breathing when she was finally born. Brook suffered severe brain damage and her life support machine was switched off three days after her birth on July 14, 2011

Admitting fault: The Dudley Group of Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust which runs Russells Hall Hospital in Dudley, West Midlands, has admitted full liability for the errors that led to baby Brook's death

Medics then whisked her first born away to be resuscitated - but her daughter suffered huge brain damage.

Her parents Miss Peters and Liam Greenfield, 30, from Dudley, West Midlands, were advised that nothing more could be done and the devastating decision was taken to switch off life support three days after she was born, on July 14, 2011.

This week, the hospital has admitted full liability for the errors and delays which lead to Brook's death.

Miss Peters said: 'I had a healthy 
pregnancy and for everything to go so badly wrong at the end has been 
very difficult to cope with.

Worst nightmare: Doctors managed to resuscitate Brook before telling heartbroken parents Miss Peters and her partner Liam Greenfield there was nothing more they could do to help their daughter

'I went through a long, painful 
labour and was totally exhausted.  i was terrified but the midwife was totally disinterested in me.

'The midwives told me my baby's head 
was crowning and to keep pushing, but I did and nothing was happening.

'I had never had a baby before but I 
pushed for more than an hour and a half and I instinctively knew 
something wasn't right - I was really scared.

'This was my first labour and, like most first time mums, I put my 
complete trust in the midwives who I thought knew best.

'When
we found out the extent of Brook's injuries, we were devastated.

'Agreeing to have her life support switched off was the hardest thing I have ever done.'Â  Mother Gemma Peters

'At one point the midwife admitted 
that she couldn't find the baby's heartbeat any more but just passed it 
off, saying it was probably because my pelvic bone was blocking the 
sound of the heartbeat.

'I had to trust her so I tried not to worry. I had been in labour for hours and was exhausted.

'She
didn't try to reassure me, or tell me what to do - my mum, Debbie, who 
is a care support worker at the same hospital, and Liam, helped me get 
comfortable.

'They were the ones reminding me to breathe and telling me it would be ok, while the midwife just stood there.

'When I finally gave birth, I was so relieved I had finally managed to deliver my baby.

'I
was so excited when they handed her over to me straight away, but when I
looked at her I could tell straight away that she wasn't breathing. I 
felt sick, my emotions were all over the place.

'I could see the cord knotted around her neck - it looked like it had been strangling her. I started screaming: "She's not breathing", and suddenly someone came and took her off me.

Tough decision: Three days after Brook was born, her parents made the heartbreaking decision to turn her life support machine off

'All the midwives went with Brook, and I was left alone, terrified of what was happening.

'Liam
went to try and find out what was going on, and my mum looked after me 
and helped clean me up, because there was no-one else there to do it.

'When
we found out the extent of Brook's injuries, we were devastated. She 
was our first child, and we were so excited about becoming parents.

'Agreeing to have her life support switched off was the hardest thing I have ever done.

Saying goodbye: Gemma Peters holds her baby daughter Brook one last time before doctors switched off life support

'After
it was clear that Brook had substantial brain damage, the midwives all 
avoided us. No-one came to see if we were alright, or look after us.'

Miss Peters, who now
has an eight-month-old daughter with partner Liam, an engineer, says 
she hopes that maternity services have since been improved so no other 
mother has the same experience.

She added: 'I am so angry about what happened. 
This was my first labour and, like most first time mums, I put my 
complete trust in the midwives who I thought knew best.

'Their mistakes led to us being 
robbed of our beautiful baby girl and although the hospital has 
apologised, nothing can turn back the clock.

'If I could give advice to 
any other expectant mum, it would be to make sure the midwife regularly 
checks your baby's heartbeat during labour and insist on a second 
opinion if necessary because things can go wrong at the last minute.

'I wish I'd had someone there to tell
me this.

'My daughter Millie is now eight months old, and it breaks my heart she will never know her big sister.

'I just want to make sure this doesn't happen ever again - no-one deserves to go through what I did.

'I can only hope that the Trust has improved maternity services
so that no other family has to go through the heartache that we have.'

Medical law experts have criticised the midwives' 'wait and see' attitude that lead to Brook's death.

Lawyers from Irwin Mitchell law firm instructed by the couple found that midwives at Russells Hall Hospital failed to correctly monitor Brook's heart rate or call a doctor for help when no heart beat could be found.

Following legal action, the Dudley Group of Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust has admitted full liability for the errors which led to Brook's death.

Jenna Harris from Irwin Mitchell's 
Birmingham office, who specialises in birth claims, said: 'This is a 
tragic case and Gemma and Liam understandably remain completely 
devastated by the death of their first child.

'The trust has admitted that the care
Gemma received from their midwives fell well short of acceptable 
standards. They agreed with our medical expert's view that, as the birth
was taking longer than expected and attempts to listen to the baby's 
heart were unsuccessful, the midwives should have called for urgent 
medical help.

'Had they
done so it would have become apparent that Brook was in distress, 
earlier delivery would have resulted and on balance Brook would have 
survived.

'Although the
trust has now admitted liability they need to now reassure patients 
that the problems identified have been acted upon and that the midwives 
concerned have been retrained so that no other parents suffer such 
unnecessary tragedy.'

Paula
Clark, Chief Executive of the Dudley Group NHS Foundation Trust, said: 
'We would like to offer our most sincere condolences to Gemma Peters on 
the sad loss of her baby, Brook, at three days old.

'We have received a claim which is now in the hands of the Trust's legal team. Unfortunately we are unable to comment further.'
