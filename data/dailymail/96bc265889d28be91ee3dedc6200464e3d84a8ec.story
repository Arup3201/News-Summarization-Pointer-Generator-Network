Nearly seven decades have passed since Sir Patrick Moore’s fiancée was killed by a Nazi bomb.

But the passage of time has clearly done little to quell the eccentric astronomer’s deep-seated feelings towards Germans.

‘The only good Kraut is a dead Kraut,’ the 89-year-old has declared in an interview to mark the 55th anniversary of his star-gazing TV show The Sky At Night.

The comment, apparently delivered with the utmost seriousness, may seem shocking to younger generations but the scars run deep for Sir Patrick.

His fiancée Lorna, a nurse, and he were both 20 when she died in an air raid on London in 1943, three years after they met.

Sir Patrick, who served with the RAF during the war, has previously told how he was so deeply in love that he entered into a life of bachelorhood after the tragedy as ‘there was no question of anyone else’.

In his interview for the latest edition of Radio Times magazine, on sale today, he suggests that Germany still thirsts for world domination, saying: ‘We must take care. There may be another war. The Germans will try again, given another chance. A Kraut is a Kraut is a Kraut. And the only good Kraut is a dead Kraut.

‘A German general said to me at the end of the war, “You won two wars. You won’t win the third. And that’s the economic war.” I hope he’s wrong.’

Outspoken: The presenter of The Sky At Night made his controversial remarks in an interview for the latest edition of Radio Times magazine

He admitted there ‘can be good, free, honourable, decent Germans’ only to add: ‘I haven’t met them myself, but I’m sure they exist.’

He continued: ‘I’m no European. Why? Go to Europe and look around. The Germans tried to conquer us. The French betrayed us. The Belgians did very little and the Italians made us our ice cream.

‘Just look at the world now and look at it when we had a bigger say in it. The English are best. Stand up for England!’

Monocle-wearing Sir Patrick, who began presenting The Sky At Night in 1957 – said he had had ‘a rather interesting war’.

‘Reliable rumours’ of his derring-do include how as a Flight Lieutenant he once climbed over the dead bodies of his pilot and co-pilot to land his Lancaster bomber safely. Then there is talk of a distinguished career in intelligence.

He confessed that he ‘fiddled’ his way into the RAF on the outbreak of war by lying about his age – he was 16 at the time, a year younger than the minimum for air crew volunteers with parental consent – and hiding a childhood heart problem.
