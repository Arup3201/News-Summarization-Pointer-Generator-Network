More than 80 elephants were killed when ivory poachers poisoned their watering holes with cyanide.

The animals were struck down when ‘salt licks’ next to pools where they drink and bathe were contaminated with the deadly chemical.

Elephants need salt to survive and the hunters cynically knew they would be drawn to the poison. Dozens of elephants were found in Zimbabwe’s Hwange National Park with bloody gaps where their tusks had been ripped out.

Zimbabwe is home to some of Africa’s 
largest elephant herds, with half of its estimated 80,000 population 
thought to be in Hwange.

The sprawling 5,657-square mile park
 is one of the few places in Africa to have escaped the rapid decline in
 the continent’s elephant population.

Police said the poachers mixed a 
cocktail of cyanide with salt and water and poured it on to about 35 
salt licks – exposed deposits of minerals that animals use to get 
nutrients vital for their survival.

The poachers also buried containers 
of their deadly mixture on the edge of watering holes, where elephants 
drink and bathe, to contaminate the water supply.

When police arrived at the sites they found the mutilated bodies of elephants strewn around.

However, some of the smaller 
elephants still had tusks in place – apparently because it had not been 
worth taking them. The poachers were said to have been paid £450 for 
every nine large tusks.

The poisonings occurred in July when 
the national park’s security forces, which protect herds from the 
ever-present threat from ivory poachers, were switched to covering the 
Zimbabwe general election and its aftermath.

There had been fears of violent demonstrations amid allegation that President Robert Mugabe’s landslide victory was rigged.

Since discovering the carcasses, 
police and rangers have searched villages close to the park and 
recovered 19 tusks, cyanide and wire snares.

Nine alleged poachers were arrested. A South African businessman has also been accused of being behind the poisonings.

Police claim that he used a Zimbabwean farmer and an ivory buyer to distribute cyanide to villagers. 
Saviour Kasukuwere, Zimbabwe’s environment minister, said the country 
was clamping down on ivory poachers as it tries to revive its tourism 
industry which has suffered years of decline.

‘We are declaring war on the poachers,’ he said.

‘We are responding with all our might
 because our wildlife, including the elephants they are killing, are 
part of the natural resources and wealth that we want to benefit the 
people of Zimbabwe.’

A spokesman for the Zimbabwe Conservation Task Force said hundreds of animals were now at risk as a result of the contamination

Mr Kasukuwere said he would push for 
stiff penalties for convicted poachers, who routinely get less than the 
nine-year jail term imposed for cattle rustling.

A wide range of other animal 
carcasses were also found near the contaminated watering holes, 
including buffalo, lions, vultures, antelopes and jackals.

And last night there were fears that 
more animals could die in coming weeks as anything that feasted on the 
elephants’ toxic carcasses could have also become poisoned.

A spokesman for the Zimbabwe 
Conservation Task Force said: ‘When other animals and birds feed on the 
rotting elephant carcasses, they will also die from the poison. Hundreds
 of animals are now at risk.’

China, which accounts for 40 per cent 
of the world’s trade in elephant tusks, is said to be one of the main 
markets for the Zimbabwean ivory, where it has been regarded as a symbol
 of wealth and status for thousands of years.
