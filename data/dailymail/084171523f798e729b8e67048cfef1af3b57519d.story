A head teacher has resigned allegedly after showing young school pupils a violent Chuck Norris video in assembly.

Simon Norton resigned earlier this month as head of St George’s Junior School in Copthorne, Shrewsbury and parents say it is because he screened a two minute YouTube video of the movie star kicking, punching and shooting people in front of children as young as seven-years-old.

The clip, entitled 5 Rules in every Chuck Norris movie, shows several people killed with bombs and bullets and Norris’ slow-motion, trademark roundhouse kick.

Too violent for children: The clip, called 5 rules in every Chuck Norris movie, which showed clips of the movie star punching, kicking and shooting people was allegedly shown to school pupils by a head teacher who has since resigned

According to The Sun, Mr Norton was suspended by education bosses after parents complained about the inappropriateness of the clip.

One parent said: ‘What did he think he was running – an army camp?

‘He must be on another planet if he thinks it is acceptable.

‘With all the violence going on in the world today, this is very worrying.’

Mr Norton is said to have played the clip in front of 350 pupils, aged between seven and ten-years-old, three weeks ago.

A joint statement from Shropshire Council and the school’s governors said: ‘We wish to announce that Simon Norton has resigned from his position and has left the school with immediate effect.

'Governors will shortly begin the process of appointing a new headteacher for the school, but in the meantime it is very much "business as usual".'

They did not comment on claims about the reason why the clip was screened.

The
YouTube clip has been viewed almost 1.4 million times and is divided 
into five sections which include Chuck Norris never reloads and Chuck 
Norris never misses his targets.

Norris
was born in Oklahoma and became a karate champion until he was urged by
friend and film star Steve McQueen to become an actor. He went on to 
star in movies alongside famous actors such as Bruce Lee.

Crying children fled a cinema after staff mistakenly screened a horror film instead of the cartoon they were expecting.

Twenty-five people bought tickets to watch animated film Madagascar 3: Europe’s Most Wanted at Cineworld, in the Cornerhouse, Nottingham.

But as parents and children settled down to watch the PG-rated film, staff accidently started showing 15-rated Paranormal Activity 4 instead.

Natasha Lewis, 32, and her eight-year-old son, Dylan Lewis-Gray, were among the shocked cinema-goers.

Miss Lewis, 32, of Bulwell, Nottingham, said: 'I’m disgusted about it. Dylan doesn’t want to set foot in there again.

'There were parents and kids in there, including some children who were younger than Dylan.

'We then saw the opening scenes and everyone started to take the kids out. We had to get the kids out fast as some were crying. Everyone was upset.

'Dylan has not liked going to the cinema before but I thought we’d try it out. He doesn’t want to go back.'

A spokeswoman for Cineworld said: 'We have investigated the incident and can confirm that this was a technical error with the projector and apologise sincerely to the families.

'All customers who were affected by the incident were offered refunds and complimentary tickets.

'We also invited customers to watch the screening of Madagascar 3 half an hour later.

'We take matters such as this very seriously and are currently working with technicians to ensure this does not happen again.'
