A woman has been left paralysed from the waist down after contracting tonsillitis so severe that she was hospitalised on her 21st birthday.

Samantha Siddell, 22, has spent months learning to walk again after she was diagnosed with a condition called transverse myelitis, thought to have been triggered by a virus.

The rare reaction caused a severe inflammation of her spinal chord, and her nervous system was attacked - leaving her complete paralysed below the waist. Her condition was so severe that she collapsed and was hospitalised on her 21st birthday.

She
 said: 'I know a lot of people end up in hospital on their 21st 
birthday, but usually it involves alcohol - I was stone cold sober, and 
terrified.

'Two days later I was completely paralysed from the waist down - and it was all thanks to tonsillitis. I never would have thought something as routine as tonsillitis would have stopped me walking.'

'I had never had tonsillitis before in my life,' she said. 'I had been suffering with it for a few weeks, but when I collapsed I knew this was not an average case.'

Miss Siddell, of Rotherham, was treated and discharged, but a week after leaving hospital, Miss Siddell started complaining of strange sensations in her hand.

She said: 'It started in my hands - I couldn’t bend my fingers.

'It was a really hot summer and whenever I picked up a cold can in a shop I found it painful. It felt like electric currant shooting through my hand.

'I went to my doctor and they told me it was probably a trapped nerve and referred me to physiotherapist.

'By the time I saw the physio the sensation had spread to my legs. The physio was shocked and said it was more serious than a trapped nerve.'

The condition baffled experts - who at first diagnosed her with either kidney or liver failure, until tests for both came back negative.

She was then referred to a neurologist as doctors thought the strange sensations could have been brought on by depression.

She said: 'The neurologist saw a large inflammation on my spinal chord but nobody could tell me what it was.'

Then on her 21st birthday, while she was enjoying a celebratory meal, her symptoms took a turn for the worse and she collapsed again.

By the next day, she couldn’t feel anything below her waist.

She said: 'At least when you have the weird sensations you can feel something. I couldn’t feel anything and it was unbelievably scary.

'It's like being on a plane and then suddenly you hear all the loud noises stop - the absence of noise is more terrifying.'

It was only when she became paralysed that she was diagnosed with transverse myelitis - a rare neurological condition which consists of inflammation of the spinal cord.

The condition myelitis causes sensory loss in the upper or lower parts of the body and in rare cases can cause complete paralysis.

It is caused when a patient’s immune system reacts abnormally and attacks tissues and organs in the body.

Doctors said that in Miss Siddell’s case, the shock of her severe tonsillitis effectively reprogrammed her immune system to attack the tissue in her spine.

Miss Siddell said: 'This mystery illness of mine which had been through every diagnosis under the sun had turned out to be this really unusual condition.'

Miss Siddell was hospitalised for the next six months. Ever since then she has been confined to a wheelchair.

She said: 'One in three people with my disease will get completely better and have no lasting symptoms.

Transverse myelitis is a neurological condition that triggers inflammation of the spinal cord.

It is thought to be caused by a virus experts remain unsure of the exact cause.

It is very rare and affects just 300 Britons each year.

Symptoms include weakness, 'heaviness' and numbness of the limbs.

In severe cases this can lead to total paralysis.

It may also cause someone to be more sensitive to touch, cold, and heat.

There may also be tight and painful muscle contractions (known as tonic muscle spasms).

The symptoms and signs depend upon the extent of the spinal cord affected.

Around 70 per cent of sufferers will never recover but intensive physiotherapy can help reduce symptoms.

'Another one in three will have partial recovery and have partial mobility - but still suffer with symptoms.

'The final third don’t make any recovery at all.'

Now approaching the two-year anniversary of her 21st birthday, Mrs Siddell has started to learn to walk again.

She said: 'I can walk very small distances now - I’m trying to slowly build back up.

'At one point I was told I would never get back out of bed again.

'I went to a specialist rehabilitation place. First I worked on being able to sit up, because I couldn’t support myself at all. I was like a ragdoll I kept falling to the side all the time.

'Then I progressed to using a standing hoist. They put a belt round my waist and it takes my weight through my arms.

'Then I started walking while being supported by people.

'I can walk short distances by myself now, but it is very tiring for me to walk around so I have to use the chair out of the house nearly all the time.

'Walking for the first time in nearly two years felt unbelievable - I had been on my back for so long and I never thought I would know what it feels like to stand on two feet again.'

Mrs Siddell won’t know for sure if she’ll be able to lose her wheelchair until three years after her initial paralysis.

She said: 'It is a possibility that I might completely get rid of the chair.

'But doctors said they have to wait another year to determine what the long-term effects of my condition are.'
