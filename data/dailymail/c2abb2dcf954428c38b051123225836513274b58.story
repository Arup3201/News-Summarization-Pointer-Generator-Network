Two bus spotters claim their hobby is being ruined by abusive drivers making rude hand gestures.

Harry Blakeway and Martin Anderson, who have taken 250,000 photographs of buses around Britain, say they get called 'bus perverts'.

Some aggressive drivers around the country who do not appreciate the attention have made obscene signals, while others shouted at them, and another has even threatened to smash their £300 cameras, the pair claim.

They also take issue with other drivers who cover their face to get out of the photo, which the spotters blast as 'dangerous'.

But one company chief executive defended his 
drivers, saying the photographers won’t take notice of polite requests 
not to take pictures.

Angry: Drivers are deliberately ruining their photos, the pair claim, by covering their faces or gesturing

Harry, 19, from Ludlow, Shropshire, said: 'I’ve liked buses all my life and go out every single day, except Sundays, taking photos of them.

'I meet up with other people and we travel all over the country - often by bus - looking at different ones.

'I’ve got around 16,000 photos on my computer and it keeps me busy.

'We’re doing nothing wrong but some of the bus drivers try to stop us and get very angry at what we’re doing.

'We’re careful not to get in their way but we get abuse from some of them, and they swear and make all sorts of hand signs.

'Others cover their faces with papers while they’re driving, which is dangerous.'

Distance: The avid photographers say they are careful not to obstruct the buses

Mr Blakeway, who doesn’t work, added: 'Probably the worst bus station is Hanley in Stoke-on-Trent.

'Most of the bus drivers there don’t like what we’re doing and we always get two fingers from them there.

'But we’re always careful to stand in the right place, on the pavement, and not to get in their way.'

Former bus driver and fellow spotter Mr Anderson, 26, from Telford, who claims to have photographed more than 200,000 buses in 11 years, says the problem is nationwide.

'Abuse': Drivers have called the pair of bus spotters 'bus perverts' and made rude gestures to block their photos

He said: 'They complain that we’re invading their privacy but we’re not interested in them - it’s their buses we are photographing.

'The buses are part of the public and in the public eye and we are entitled to photograph them.'

Mr Blakeway claims the worst offenders are drivers from the Arriva bus company.

He complained to their head office a couple of months ago and emailed a selection of his abusive drivers in action.

He said: 'I’ve reported all this to Arriva but they said there’s nothing they can do about it.'

Both enthusiasts are determined not to let the conflict interfere with their childhood fascination.

Mr Blakeway has been interested in buses since he was a child. His all-time favourites are the old Dennis Dart, followed by the modern Mercedes Setra.

Privacy: 'They complain that we're invading their privacy but we're not interested in them - it's their buses we are photographing. The buses are in the public eye, we are entitled to,' Mr Blakeway said

His hobby has seen him make a day trip as far as Paisley in Scotland - by train - and he added: 'I’m not going to let these drivers stop me.

'They seem to think what I’m doing is sad and they hate having their photos taken, but I will carry on.

'I enjoy taking photos of buses so I can look at them in years to come and remember what they were like when I was younger.'

Mr Anderson has been obsessed with buses since the age of two when his grandad drove them and gave him a lift.

One of the photos shows a bus driver giving a V-sign in Chester on October 12 this year.

The firm is owned by Wrexham-based GHA Coaches and chief executive Stuart Hyslop made no apology for the abusive gesture.

Enthusiast: Harry Blakeway, 19, has taken around 16,000 photos of buses around Britain since he was a child

He said: 'Some of the drivers object to having their photographs taken and these people have been asked not to take them without obtaining their permission.

'If they want to take photographs when our buses are empty, that’s no problem.

'We’ve tried politely to ask them not to take photogaphs and if they ignore them I can’t be responsible for what the drivers do.

'The drivers are making obscene gestures because these people won’t take any notice of politeness.'

Another photograph shows a driver for Wrexham-based Pat’s Coaches making a V-sign gesture in the town in November 2011.

Company spokesman Mark Davies said: 'Unfortunately we can not identify the driver from the picture but all staff have been told that we do not accept this kind of behaviour from our staff.'

A spokesman for Arriva told MailOnline: 'We expect our drivers to act in a responsible and courteous manor at all times.

'If customers have any reason to find that that is not the case we would like to know as soon as possible.

'We can be contacted on 0844 800 4411 where we will be pleased to investigate any incident.'
