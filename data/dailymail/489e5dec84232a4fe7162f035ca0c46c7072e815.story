Arrested: A picture of Garry Handlen taken around the time he allegedly killed two young girls in British Columbia. He is now facing two charges of murder

A 67-year-old man is facing two counts of first-degree murder over the killings of two young girls that shocked Canada more than three decades ago.

Garry Handlen, from Ontario, is accused of killing 11-year-old Kathryn-Mary Herbert in 1975 and 12-year-old Monica Jack in 1978.

Officers from the Royal Canadian Mounted Police arrested him on Friday in Surrey, British Columbia, after a long campaign by the victims' families and a cold-case review.

Kathryn-Mary Herbert disappeared on September 24, 1975, as she made her way home in Abbotsford, a city in the south of BC. Her remains were uncovered two months later. She had suffered a broken jaw and a fractured skull.

Monica Jack vanished on May 6, 1978, while riding her bike north on Highway 5A near Merritt, a small city in BC's Nicola Valley. Her bike was found the next day but her remains were only found 17 years later.

The RCMP said Handlen had been a suspect in the killings shortly after they happened but it's only now that they have enough evidence to charge him, Canadian Broadcasting Corporation (CBC) News reported.

Investigators wouldn't be drawn on what the new evidence is that is alleged to link Handlen to the killings, but they reportedly said advances in forensic science had been a factor.

A man with the same name as Handlen was convicted of the rape of an 18-year-old housewife in 1971 and sentenced to five-and-a-half years in jail. Eight years later, a Garry Taylor Handlen was handed an 18-year prison term for the rape of 21-year-old hitchhiker.

Speaking at a news conference at British Columbia's Mountie HQ, Madeline Lanaro, Monica's mother, stood with tears streaming down her face as she said the 'hurt never goes away'.

'Everybody was at a loss about where she could be,' the Vancouver Sun quoted her as saying. 'We never gave up.'

Kathyn-Mary's mother, Shari Greer, also spoke through tears. 'There is no such thing as a cold case to the families, nor is there ever closure, only resolution surrounding the events,' she said.

Superintendent Ward Lymburner, the officer in charge of the special projects unit whose investigations led to the charges against Handler, said three decades of investigation had pinpointed the same suspect.

'He was brought into the investigation as a suspect or person of interest in the investigation early on,' he was quoted as saying by Canada's Global News.

'It has taken us this long for us to gather the evidence needed to satisfy the courts to bring him forward on charges today.'
