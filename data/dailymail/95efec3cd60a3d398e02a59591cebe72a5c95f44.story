George North recovered from having his spine brutally re-arranged at Franklin’s Gardens to ignite Northampton’s title defence with a sensational hat-trick.

The Wales wing appeared in danger of being forced out of this fiery Aviva Premiership opener after just five minutes, when he was smashed in the back, off the ball, by Gloucester lock Tom Savage.

But he eventually shook off the damaging effects of the dubious hit to score two tries before the break and wrap up his treble in the 50th minute to send Jim Mallinder’s side on their way to an emphatic victory which will leave their rivals in no doubt that the champions mean business.

This was a galling occasion for David Humphreys as he attempts to orchestrate a revival at Gloucester, especially when his men alarmingly unravelled in the latter stages. Up front, the visitors were often abrasive and dogged, yet they were eclipsed by the Saints forwards, who drove their opponents into submission. American No 8 Samu Manoa was outstanding, as was the ring-master behind the scrum, Stephen Myler.

These rival clubs had approached the new season from opposite ends of the preparatory spectrum. For Northampton, on the back of domestic and European success, the buzz-word was ‘stability’.Gloucester, on the other hand, had responded to abject failure in 2013-14 by overhauling their management and squad.

The first points of the season went to the Saints’ prolific sharp-shooter, Stephen Myler, but the first statement of intent came from Calum Clark, who unceremoniously flattened Billy Twelvetrees in the first minute. Gloucester’s captain suffered worse damage later in the first half when he was blasted backwards by the rampaging Manoa.

Tussle: Gloucester's Henry Tinder endured a difficult evening and was on the receiving end 

North also dished out a robust tackle on Henry Trinder early on, but seconds later he was on the receiving end of Savage’s smash from behind. North was treated and appeared to be struggling for some time afterwards, but he soon made light of the pain.

After James Hook briefly levelled the scores from the tee, the champions swept ahead. From an attacking lineout on the left, Courtney Lawes claimed the catch and the home pack rumbled forward, drawing in defenders. Having created space, the ball was transferred left again and Luther Burrell sent North over in the corner.

Myler converted from an acute angle and the Northampton No 10 had a major hand — or foot, to be precise — in his side’s second try on the half-hour. He sent a penalty to touch on the right and after the forwards had repeated their deadly catch-and-drive routine, he chipped diagonally into the 22, where George Pisi took the ball on the full and crashed under the posts.

Score-sheet: James Hook scored a penalty for Gloucester,  Greig Laidlaw scored the other

Try: James Wilson makes a break to set up a try for Northampton centre Luther Burrell

Tackle: Kahn Fotouali'l scores a try for Northampton despite last-gasp tap tackle 

That was a stylish strike but there was even better to come, once another Myler conversion had been followed by a Greig Laidlaw penalty. Right on half-time, Lee Dickson broke from a lineout and Myler released James Wilson, whose brilliant off-load picked out George Pisi, whopassed on to North and, ignoring inside runners, he dummied and stepped outside to touch down himself. Myler’s third conversion made it 24-6 at half-time.

The procession continued in the second half. Wilson was running amok from full back and the Kiwi set up a fourth try for the rampant hosts. After breaking from halfway, he drew the last defender and a sublime, deft pass sent England centre Burrell in at the left corner.

Man of the match: George North goes over for one of his three tries in a hugely impressive performance 

Gloucester: Billy Twelvetrees in action as the visitors shipped eight tries on a terrible night 

Defence: Northampton enjoyed the perfect start to the defence of their Aviva Premiership title 

Again Myler added the extra two points and his personal tour de force went on and on. With an England squad due to be announced next month, this was an ideal time for the Saints playmaker to show peak form. He conjured North’s hat-trick try with a wonderful pass; floated high and long to the left flank where the predatory Lion pounced to bring the house down.

There was no let-up in the punishment for Gloucester. Replacement scrum half Kahn Fotuali’i had been on the field just two minutes when he touched down on the left from another canny kick through by Myler and then Jon Fisher claimed a try on his competitive debut.

The last word — and eighth Saints try — went to Burrell, who latched on to a loose pass by Ross Moriarty for an easy canter to the line. What could have been a close contest had become a massacre. The champions are up and running; the rest have been warned.
