The lawyer who exchanged sexist emails with Premier League chief executive Richard Scudamore is being investigated by his firm.

DLA Piper, a global law firm with headquarters in London, has released a statement after TV rights legal specialist Nick West was named as the person exchanging the emails with Scudamore.

A Premier League committee is to meet on Monday to discuss the case, which will also be the subject of a special meeting of the Football Association's Inclusion Advisory Board on Tuesday.

A statement from DLA Piper said: 'We uphold the highest professional standards as a firm and this matter is being fully investigated.'

The emails, which have been described by FA chairman Greg Dyke as 'totally inappropriate', referred to women in derogatory terms, contained sexual innuendoes, and made jokes about 'female irrationality'.

Scudamore has apologised for the emails, which were sent privately from his Premier League email account but were published in a Sunday newspaper.

The case will go before the Premier League's audit and remuneration committee, chaired by Chelsea chairman Bruce Buck, on Monday.

Sports minister Helen Grant has already branded the content of Scudamore's emails 'completely unacceptable', while Labour's shadow sports minister Clive Efford has written to both the FA and Premier League asking why Scudamore has not faced action.

Scudamore's emails were seen by a 
former temporary PA, who leaked them to the Sunday Mirror.

In a 
statement on Sunday, Scudamore said the exchanges were 'private emails 
exchanged between colleagues and friends of many years' that should not 
have been accessed by the temporary employee, but accepted they were 
inappropriate and added: 'It was an error of judgment that I will not 
make again.'

The Premier League said a formal process was under way dealing with Scudamore's emails.

England and Everton women's goalkeeper Rachel Brown-Finnis said the emails were an 'insult to all women' and that Scudamore should be sanctioned.

She told BBC Sport: 'It's not just about women who are involved in football, it was an insult to all women.

'However jokey he was trying to be with that, it's just totally unacceptable in this day and age.

'It's zero defence for me. Private emails when are you head of the Premier League don't really exist.

'Is a sorry enough? Probably not, but I do think the way to move forward is for the Premier League to follow their protocols just like they would with other employees and I'm sure they have policies which would sanction him appropriately for his misconduct.'
