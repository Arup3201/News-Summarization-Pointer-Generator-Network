One of Silicon Valley’s most valued men could soon become one of the president’s closest business confidants.

Google Chairman Eric Schmidt is reportedly in line for a powerful position within the Obama administration.

Schmidt, 57, the search giant’s former chief executive, may soon become secretary of Treasury or Commerce, or fill a new ‘secretary of business’ slot, the Washington Examiner reports.

From the valley to the capital: Google Executive Chairman Eric Schmidt could be tapped by the Obama Administration to fill a high-power cabinet seat as a business confidant

Schmidt’s big role in the Obama re-election campaign, Google's $1.9 million donation to Democrats during the race, and Washington's efforts to quiet a looming Federal Trade Commission investigation into Google are key signs that the president wants Schmidt in his cabinet, insiders believe.

‘Nobody's better positioned for a Cabinet job, if he wants one,’ an unnamed Democratic strategist told the Examiner.

Since Obama first ran for office five years ago, Google and Schmidt have stayed by his side with financial, political and technological support.

Obama stopped by the company headquarters in Mountain View, California, in 2007 and told Google employees, ‘What we shared is a belief in changing the world from the bottom up, not from the top down.’

Google's political action committee gave $1.6 million to Democrats in 2008 and only $300,000 to GOP candidates, according to the Center for Responsive Politics.

This year the committee has given $2.1 million to Democrats and $715,000 to Republicans.

Google donated more than $700,000 to Obama alone in the November’s election.

When the President began asking Congress for a new round of stimulus spending in 2011, Schmidt helped promote the ‘jobs bill’ intended to help jumpstart the U.S. economy and help Americans hit hardest by the recession.

‘The economy is, today, stuck behind the power curve -- it needs a lot of encouragement,’ he said during a September 2011 interview on ABC’s ‘This Week with Christiane Amanpour.’

Without the jobs bill, he said, ‘We’re set up for years of extraordinarily low growth in the economy and no real solution to the jobless problem.’

As more political insiders and cabinet shakeup watchers forecast predictions of Schmidt taking a high-level cabinet seat, critics are paying close attention to the relationship between Google and the Obama administration, the Examiner reports.

That’s a familiar story.

Schmidt testified before a subcommittee of the Senate Judiciary Committee on September 21, 2001, along with representatives of companies who were saying Google’s power is too great.

Prior to that hearing, Google began ramping up its lobbying presence in the nation's capital.

After that hearing, little changed for the search giant in terms of its daily operations, though an FTC investigation is ongoing.

Obama has made his feelings about Google clear. The President's pick to fill a Republican spot on the FTC co-authored a paper in the Harvard Journal of Law and Public Policy titled ‘Google and the Limits of Antitrust: The Case Against the Case against Google’

Now Obama and Schmidt could take their close ties behind closed doors.

‘Support in 2008, plus support in 2012, plus personal counsel by Schmidt to Messina in 2012, may now equal a plum cabinet post,’ one source told the Examiner.
