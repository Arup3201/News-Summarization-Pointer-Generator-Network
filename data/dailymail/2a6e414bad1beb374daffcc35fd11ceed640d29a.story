Celtic face competition in their efforts to land Stuart Armstrong after Sporting Lisbon emerged as rival bidders for the Dundee United midfielder.

As Sportsmail exclusively revealed last week, Scotland’s reigning champions are poised to reignite their interest in the 22-year-old when the January transfer window opens.

Celtic assistant manager John Collins went on a specific scouting mission to watch Armstrong in action for Dundee United against Motherwell in the Scottish Cup.

The player’s strong running and eye for goal — he showed great composure to find the net at the end of a brilliant counter-attack in Friday night’s league win away to Ross County — have made him an obvious target for Ronny Deila.

But reports in Portugal now suggest that Sporting are keen to land yet another promising Tannadice youngster, having swooped to sign Ryan Gauld on a six-year deal in the summer — and immediately slapping a £48million buy-out clause on the attacker.

It is understood that, while the Lisbon side always intended to ease Gauld into the club by fielding him mainly for their B side, Scotland Under-21 star Armstrong is viewed as a player capable of making an immediate impact.
