While the rest of the government was preparing to shut down this fall, the State Department was preparing to party - buying up nearly $200,000 worth of liquor for its overseas embassies.

According to official records, the department spent about $180,000 in September, the final month of the fiscal year, on wine, whiskey and bourbon for events and presents in cities including Tokyo and Moscow.

This last minute booze spree brought the year's total spend to more than $400,000, which is three times the entire liquor bill for 2008.

The Washington Times unearthed the costly alcohol bill that was split among purchase orders placed at embassies around the world, and some splurges were so last-minute, they occurred just hours before the government shutdown.

According to the Times, $5,625 in 'gratuity wine' was ordered at the U.S. embassy in Rio de Janeiro on September 29, followed by $5,925 in 'gratuity whiskey' on the day the shutdown began.

Meanwhile, $22,416 worth of wine was ordered at the embassy in Tokyo and their Moscow counterparts ordered $15,900 in bourbon and whiskey as the shutdown loomed. The Bucharest embassy bought Jack Daniels for its gratuities.

U.S. embassies have always served alcohol at diplomatic events, irrespective of whether Democrats or Republicans are in power or the state of the economy.

But the Post found the amount spend 
on liquor has shot up starkly in recent years. According to the federal 
government's procurement database, which includes a specific code 
enabling the public to track alcoholic beverage purchase orders, the 
State Department bought $415,000 worth of alcohol in fiscal 2012.

That staggering amount was 25 per cent more than the $331,000 spent in 2011 and more than triple the $118,000 spent in 2008.

The ballooning taxpayer-funded booze bill needs to be more closely scrutinized, particularly with the current debt level, Taxpayers Protection Alliance president Dave Williams told the Post.

The non profit watchdog group said that while it's unsurprising the department went on a buying binge pre-shutdown so as not to risk its budget getting cut in future.

However, spending money on liquor for parties when families are reigning things in if crass, Williams said.

'This is what taxpayers don't understand,' he said. 'You have a looming government shutdown but then you have a "use-it-or-lose-it" mentality where someone is spending tens of thousands of dollars because they have to.

'If you're a family or a business and you're getting ready for a potential loss of revenue, the first thing you do is get rid of the parties,' he said. 'It's symbolic.'

But the State Department told the Times that looking at 'a subset of purchases made by embassies overseas' would be an 'oversimplification' of the department's operation priorities.

They also said throwing parties and giving gifts were important for diplomacy.

'The United States wishes to make the best impression in its dealings with foreign governments and other groups and carries out lawfully its representational activities, including its diplomatic receptions, in as effective and as culturally appropriate a manner as possible,' the statement to the Times read.

'The department also does so fully mindful of its duties as the steward of the public resources entrusted to it.'

Not all embassies opted for alcohol as a diplomatic gesture, th Times found. The Athens embassy spent $7,300 on books by photographer Ansel Adams for Christmas gratuities, while the Tokyo embassy spent more than $50,000 on boxes of chocolates for the holidays.

The Department defended the spending saying it needed throw parties and give gifts in the name of diplomacy

But it said looking a 'subset' of purchases at foreign embassies was misleading
