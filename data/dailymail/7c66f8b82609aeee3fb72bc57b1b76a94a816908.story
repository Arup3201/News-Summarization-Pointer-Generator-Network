'I want to focus on my family and concentrate on my work at Bayern Munich and make way in the national team for the many young and exciting players.'

'One has to know when to stop,' he added. 'I have experienced so much and now is the time for others to come forward. You could see at the World Cup that we should have no concerns about France's future.

'There were highs and lows but now is the time to start a new chapter in my life.'
