A 20-year-old Michigan man who shot dead a cop who caught him driving on a suspended license left a trail of mysterious letters before hanging himself in his prison cell last month.

Eric John Knysz was just one week into serving a life sentence for the first-degree murder of Michigan State Police Trooper Paul K. Butterfield II when he was found hanging by a braided bed sheet with a white towel over his eyes on April 14.

Michigan State Police investigative reports, obtained by MLive Muskegon Chronicle, show the killer left notes asking for God's forgiveness, expressing a need to 'get out of here now' and stating his life was over at 20 while telling someone 'yours doesn’t have to be'.

Knysz confessed to shooting 43-year-old Butterfield in the head on September 9, 2013, at a traffic stop on a rural Mason County road out of ear of going to prison.

Cryptic: Eric Knysz left behind a series of mysterious notes before hanging himself in a Michigan prison last month. He was one week into a life sentence for killing a police officer

Cut short: State Trooper Paul K. Butterfield II was newly engaged to Jennifer Sielski when he was shot dead in September last year

Slain: Trooper Paul Butterfield II was shot dead by Eric Knysz during a routine traffic stop in September

He was driving on a suspended license and had stolen guns concealed in his pickup truck.

Investigators
 say Knysz didn't leave a 'true suicide note' but several handwritten 
letters that show he was contemplating taking his own life.

Knysz had written on his bed: 'I hope you can forgive me Lord.'

He
 had also written on paper: 'My life is over at just 20. Yours doesn’t 
have to be. Stop f---in around an start a family an stop breaking the 
law.'

The report doesn’t 
indicate whom the note was addressed to, but Knysz’s wife, 21-year-old 
Sarah Renee Knysz, is serving a prison sentence of two to five years for
 helping her husband flee after the shooting. 

On December 25, 2013, she gave birth to their son, who is believed to have been placed in the care of family while she returned to prison.

On
 the back of a sheet of 8 ½” by 11” paper containing information for 
incoming prisoners were numerous short, handwritten notes including: 
'Father if you accept my decision I will be with you tommrow evening. I 
(hope?) and prey that you do and have mercy on my soul.'

On
 another sheet of paper titled 'Health care request', Knysz had written 
under problem or symptom: 'I need to get out of here now.'

Knysz
 was sentenced April 8 to life in prison without chance of parole - just
 six days before his suicide - following an emotionally-charged trial.

As well as first degree murder, Knysz was
 also found guilty of vehicle theft, carrying a concealed weapon, felony
 firearm and being an habitual offender.

Speaking at Knysz’s sentencing hearing, Butterfield’s fiancee, Jennifer Sielski said: 'I felt like 
the luckiest woman in the world just to be a part of Paul’s life... He was
 my friend, my inspiration, my hero, my soulmate.'

Cop killer: Eric Knysz was just 19 when he murdered Michigan State Police Trooper Paul K. Butterfield II and was sentenced to life without parole

Paul Butterfield's father (left) spoke at the sentencing. He addressed Knysz directly, comparing his murdered son's many achievements by the age of 19 with the little Eric Knysz has accomplished

Mr Butterfield's father also spoke at the sentencing, addressing Knysz directly.

'At the age of 19 years old you have 
effectively ended the life of freedom for yourself... At 19, Paul was a 
high school graduate, a state class A cross-country champion and 
enrolled at the University of Tennessee for track and country. He ran 
marathons world-wide and participated in several triathalons… what have 
you accomplished by the age of 19?' he said.

'I
 do not know if you’re planning on giving a statement to the court but 
if you say how sorry you are for what happened it’ll be for one reason 
and one reason only and as that is you got caught,' Mr Butterfield added.

During sentencing Knysz did apologize to the Butterfield family 'for everything I’ve done and the pain I’ve put them through'.

'I’m sorry, I never meant to take the life of your son. I never meant for any of this to happen,' he added.

In his closing arguments during the trial, defense 
attorney David Glancy noted that the only witness who could place Knysz 
in the pickup that day was his wife, Sarah, who testified against him.

Glancy
 said she benefited from a plea deal with prosecutors that brought her a
 sentence of two to five years in prison as an accessory after the fact.

Couple convicted: Sarah Knysz, pictured with her husband, gave birth to the couple's child in December, but remains in prison serving a two to five sentence for accessory after testifying against her partner. The baby is with family

Baby-faced criminal: Eric Knysz has a long 
criminal history dating back to his first offense at age 14, when he was
 charged with breaking into a person's home

Sarah Knysz,
 who was in the car at the time of the shooting, had told the court it 
was out of fear for her life and that of her unborn child that she 
protected her husband after the shooting.

'There wasn’t anything that I thought I could have done that day,' she said.

'He
 had a gun and he shot the trooper, and if he did that, what was he 
going to do to a witness that was going to tell on him and was going to 
turn him in? I just wanted to keep me and my baby safe. I was just 
thinking about my baby.'

She added: 'I didn’t mean for any of this to happen, and I didn’t have control over it happening.'
