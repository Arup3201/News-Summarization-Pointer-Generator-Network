A two-year-old boy has been left paralysed from the chest down just hours after walking up the stairs for the first time in his life.

John James Michalowski , known as JJ, will never walk again after suffering severe spinal injuries when Daniel Thrower crashed into his family's car on March 8.

Thrower, 34, from Doncaster, South Yorkshire, pleaded guilty to dangerous driving when he appeared at Leeds Crown Court yesterday.

He also admitted aggravated vehicle taking which involved him driving the Ford Mondeo dangerously on the A628 bypass in Hemsworth, West Yorkshire, and causing the accident which injured the toddler and three others travelling in a Peugeot 407.

The court heard that JJ's father Igor and sisters Llacia Michalowski and Leah Darley all suffered injury in the horror crash.

JJ's mum, Katy Michalowski, said: 'Although JJ had been walking since he was nine-months-old, the morning of the accident he actually walked up and down the stairs for the first time like an adult would. It breaks my heart to know now he will never walk again.

'I just want him to be able to have his own independence and play like all the other children.

'He can't sit up by himself and he gets very frustrated at times that we have to do everything with him. He needs constant care and support for his back and we don't have the equipment we need to be able to give him that.

'I've still got hope for JJ. From the moment he wakes up to the moment he goes to sleep, all he does is smile.'

The youngster, along with his father Igor (pictured together right) and two sisters was injured when Thrower's stolen Ford Mondeo crashed into the family's Peugeot 407 on the A628 bypass in Hemsworth, West Yorkshire

Mrs Michalowski, who is a carer at a nursing home, said she can't remember much about the day of the crash but said it has changed her life completely.

She said: 'The accident has torn our family apart.

'I had no idea what had happened because I was in work. I got a phone call at work and I thought it was just a bump but when I turned up at the hospital I saw a police car and I knew it was worse.'

Doctors thought the toddler had suffered brain damage but later found that he had extensive damage to his spine. 

Thrower, 34, (pictured outside Wakefield Magistrates' Court at an earlier hearing) will be sentenced next month after admitting the offences

He will now be paralysed from the chest down for the rest of his life and needs to use a ventilator to help him breathe when sleeping.

Mrs Michalowski: 'They knew JJ was ill at the crash because he was sick instantly. He was alert until he got to the hospital and then he stopped responding. He didn't respond for five hours and they thought he had brain problems.

'He had a CT scan but that didn't show anything so they then did the MRI scan. It showed that he had back injuries and at that time he didn't have use of his legs or arms.

'We've being doing a lot of rehab and JJ shouldn't have the use of his arms, but can now use them. He is very intelligent and fantastic with his hands which is why we want him to have an electric wheelchair. He likes to do things himself and is very determined. If he can do it, he will.'

Richard Davies, defending, asked for sentencing to be adjourned until September 4 for a pre-sentence report to be prepared.

Judge Guy Kearl QC, bailed Thrower, until his next appearance but warned him: 'It's almost inevitable that you will be sentenced to a custodial sentence and you know that.'

Members of the youngster's family were in court to hear Thrower enter his guilty pleas.

JJ's family are now aiming to raise money to buy specialist equipment, including a joystick-controlled wheelchair to give him back some independence.
