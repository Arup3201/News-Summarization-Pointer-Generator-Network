Two more women have come forward to accused Bill Cosby of drugging and raping them in their youth.

Margie Shapiro and Sunni Welles both claim they were 17-years-old when, after a night out with Cosby, they woke up and realized they had been sexually assaulted. 

What's more, Welles was a lifelong family friend of the embattled comedian.

Over 30 women have come forward since last October claiming they were sexually assaulted by Cosby (above), who has repeatedly denied all their claims

The two women detailed their experiences in a press conference with lawyer Gloria Allred on Friday afternoon that was covered by The Wrap.

Shapiro claims that she and Cosby met in 1975 when she worked at a doughnut shop in Santa Monica that the actor would frequent, and that he invited her to visit him on the set of the film he was working on at the time.

From there he invited her to a dinner, but it was cancelled so he took her to the Playboy Mansion.

Once there she says the two entered a 'game house' and began playing pinball.

She said that she was not drinking at the time, but Cosby said whoever lost the game would have to take a pill, which she admits she agreed to.

After losing and taking the pill, she claims she woke up to find that she was naked and Cosby was inside her.

She says she passed back out but came to once more and that Cosby was touching her sexually.

In the end, he told her she was not dressed well enough to meet Hugh Hefner and she was sent home with a driver.

After that, she remembers 'feeling sick' when she saw Cosby's image in her head.

Welles meanwhile had known Cosby for years as her mother worked in Hollywood, first as a theatrical agent and then a story editor, and that as a teenager studying music she was thrilled when Cosby offered to take her to see some jazz back in the mid-1960s.

Cosby and her mother had a friendship, so neither mother or daughter thought anything of it, and the experience of seeing live music would be good they thought as Welles was auditioning to be a background singer.

Welles, like Shapiro, was not drinking, and ordered a Coke she claims at the club.

After she had a sip she says 'things began to become blurry.'

The next thing she remembers is waking up in an empty apartment feeling as if she had engaged in sexual intercourse. 

Cosby was nowhere to be found, so the young woman went home.

Now Welles, who called Cosby a 'sexual predator,' is seeing if she might still be able to bring a suit against him.

This all comes just days after Chelsea Handler (above with ex Andre Balazs) came forward to reveal that she too believes she might have become one of Cosby's victims

This all comes just days after Chelsea Handler came forward to reveal that she too believes she might have become one of Cosby's victims after he invited her to his hotel room in Atlantic City a few years back.

Feeling uncertain, she decided to bring some male friends along with her, and she believes that is why she was not preyed upon by the actor. 

Over 30 women have come forward since last October claiming they were sexually assaulted by Cosby, who has repeatedly denied all their claims.

In the aftermath however he has seen appearances cancelled as well as a Netflix special and a planned NBC series.
