A diehard Miley Cyrus fan managed to sneak backstage just hours before her performance in Omaha last Wednesday and leave a note in the singer’s dressing room.

Unfortunately for Tucker Salvesen, 18, he couldn’t resist tweeting the singer to tell her what he’d done and in doing so alerted authorities who arrested him the next evening when he was due to see her perform.

Salvesen traveled all the way from Utah to Nebraska with a ticket to see the singer at the CenturyLink Center on Thursday night, but hell-bent on wanting to meet his idol he arrived a day early.

According to the police report, Salvesen managed to procure a VIP pass from a truck driver who told him that he ‘worked for the tour’.

Unbeknownst to Salvesen, VIP passes are only supposed to give access to certain areas of the building which don’t include the restricted area where star's dressing rooms are located. 

Thinking the pass gave him access to the entire building, Salvesen successfully managed to walk past several people on his way to Miley's dressing room without being stopped.

Once inside he left the singer a note asking her to meet with him.

According to the police report, it read:
 ‘I snuck back here I need to meet you. You have helped me so much your 
music has given me all the answers I was looking for when my heart got 
broke ... we went through the same thing @ the same time ... Miley I 
love you!!! Please let me meet you.’

Salvesen also left his phone number and Twitter username for the singer, reports KETV.

The incident happened last Wednesday when Miley played the first of two nights at the CenturyLink Center in Omaha

After the fan left the dressing room he sent a public message on Twitter to Miley Cyrus to tell her that he had left a note in the dressing room for her.

'I snuck in your dressing room today in Omaha there's a note in there for you!!!,’ he tweeted along with a photo of the entrance to the dressing room marked Miley Cyrus.

Unfortunately for Salvesen when he arrived at the venue the next evening he was arrested by cops on suspicion of misdemeanor criminal trespassing at the request of CenturyLink Center officials.

But Salvesen's love for Miley knows no bounds and unperturbed he tweeted: 'I got arrested for going backstage!!! That's true fan dedication right!??!?'

Salvesen has already purchased tickets to another show next month in Kansas City on April 15 and he maintains that he has no regrets.

'I would do it all again, wouldn't change a thing, I can't be tamed,' he tweeted.
