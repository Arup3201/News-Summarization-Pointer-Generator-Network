Devastating: Quaid Thomas Dolan was killed on Tuesday leaving his friends and family heartbroken

An Oklahoma community is in mourning after a four-year-old boy was killed when his father accidentally ran him over during a school drop-off.

Quaid Thomas Dolan had just climbed out of his father Brian's truck at around 8 a.m outside the Christ the King Catholic School in Nichols Hills near Oklahoma City when he somehow 'got hung up' in the vehicle and was pulled under the car as his dad drove away, according to police.

One student described how the death had deeply affected everyone because the school is so close-knit.

Evan told KFor News: ‘It was really emotional. Everyone was sad because at our school everyone is just a big family.’

He added: 'His brothers, they were crying. They were very sad that he was gone.'

Archdiocese spokesperson Tina Dzurisin said that the boy’s parents are ‘absolutely devastated’.

She
 added: ‘Here in this building we all gathered and bowed our heads and 
prayed, and that really is the first reaction we have to something like 
this.'

'It is with a heavy 
heart that I acknowledge the painful tragedy that occurred at Christ the
 King this morning,' The Most Rev. Paul S. Coakley, Archbishop of 
Oklahoma City, said. 'As an archdiocese, we grieve the loss of Quaid 
Thomas Dolan and pray for the peace and comfort of all those who are 
affected by this sad and unexpected occurrence. My sympathy and concern 
go out especially to the Dolan family and to the entire Christ the King 
community in this time of suffering.’

Brian
 Dolan has not been cited for any wrongdoing, Oklahoma City Police Sgt. 
Jennifer Wardlow said, adding that investigators are trying to determine
 exactly how the death happened.

Shocked: The accident has devastated the local community

'Obviously this is a very tragic, unfortunate accident,' Wardlow told NewsOk.com.

It was reported that before paramedics arrived on the scene one teacher had desperately tried to save Quaid's life with CPR.

The Dolans have six other children and it is believed the father was dropping a number of them off at the school on Tuesday when Quaid was struck.

Christ the King pastor the Rev. Rick Stansberry said the parish would 'walk with' the Dolans in their grief and support them through the ordeal.

A steady stream of parents came to the school to pick up their children after the accident occurred. Many were seen hugging their kids tightly.

'I think everybody is just really upset,' one parent, Nicole Bauske, told NewsOK.com.
