Joseph Kennedy III, the grandson of the late U.S. Senator Robert Kennedy, has announced that he is considering taking a run for Congress.

The 31-year-old said last night that he is resigning as a prosecutor at the Middlesex District Attorney's office in Boston, Massachusetts, as he explores a possible candidacy.

His last day there will be in two weeks.

A political future? Joseph Kennedy III, the grandson of Robert Kennedy, has announced that he is considering taking a run for Congress

Should Joseph Kennedy III decide to run for Congress, he will be actively partaking in a political dynasty that many believe is cursed by tragic misfortune.

Most famously, of course, was the assassination of his great-uncle President John F Kennedy in 1963.

His grandfather Robert Kennedy also fell victim to an assassin's bullet in 1968.

The following year Ted Kennedy survived the Chappaquiddick scandal, in which a
car he was driving drove off a bridge and killed passenger Mary Jo
Kopechne.

William Kennedy Smith, son of Jean Kennedy Smith, became famous for
a well-publicised 1991 rape trial in Palm Beach, in which he was
acquitted.

John F Kennedy Jr was killed when he crashed his plane in July 1999.

Bobby Kennedy's son Michael - Joseph III's uncle - died when he skied into a tree in 1997.

In a statement, Mr Kennedy said: 'My decision to look seriously at 
elected office is grounded in a deep commitment to public service and my
experience - both my own and that of my family - in finding just, 
practical, and bipartisan solutions to difficult challenge.'

Kennedy, the son of former Democratic Congressman Joseph Kennedy II, said he will 
make a final decision about entering the race after he has time to talk 
with potential constituents about issues.

As a potential candidate representing 
the Fourth District of Massachusetts, he would be vying for the post held by Barney Frank
since 1980.   

Senator Frank, a Democrat, announced his retirement in late November.

Mr Kennedy would be the latest of many Kennedys to seek public office, although no member of the famous political family is in office at the moment.

His grandfather was Robert Kennedy, who 
served as U.S. Attorney General and as a U.S. Senator from New York. He 
was assassinated in 1968.

His great-uncles were the late U.S. President John F Kennedy and the late Senator Ted Kennedy from Massachusetts.

His father founded the non-profit Citizens Energy Corp in 1979 and later served as a U.S. Congressman from Massachusetts for 12 years.

The Kennedy family has seen its 
influence in Washington fade in recent years as its younger generations 
have largely shunned public office.

The death of Senator Edward Kennedy of Massachusetts in 2009 left a void for the family.

The retirement of his son Rep Patrick Kennedy
of Rhode Island last year marked the first time in 63 years that there 
was not a Kennedy serving in elected office in Washington.

His exit marked a bittersweet turn for one of America's most 
powerful and prominent political families.

Politics was the family 
business, the lifeblood of a dynasty that often dominated the public 
stage with its triumphs, as well as its personal traumas.

JFK arrived as a young congressman in 1947, later capturing the 
White House and leaving an outsized stamp on the nation's history. First
Lady Jackie was equally memorable.

Robert Kennedy's presidential ambitions were snuffed out by an assassin's bullet, but he inspired generations of activists.

Edward Kennedy was seen as one of the most influential senators in U.S. history.

Bobby Shriver is currently the lone family member in politics, serving as a city 
councillor in the seaside Los Angeles suburb of Santa Monica.
