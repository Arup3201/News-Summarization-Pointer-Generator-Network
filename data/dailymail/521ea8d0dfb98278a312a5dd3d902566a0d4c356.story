Influential conservative commentator Charles Krauthammer has praised Republican House Speaker John Boehner for preventing a ‘rape of the Treasury’ by blocking a larger relief bill for the victims of Hurricane Sandy.

Bohener and the GOP leadership have been criticized by New York-area Republicans for failing to pass a $60 billion bill to the floor, with New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie calling it ‘disgusting.’

Instead, the House passed a much smaller bill dealing solely with flood insurance on Friday, with a larger bill set to follow.

Fox News' commentator Charles Krauthammer praised John Boehner, claiming he had prevented a 'rape of the Treasury'

More than two months after Superstorm Sandy struck, the House and Senate Friday approved $9.7 billion to pay flood insurance claims. The vote came days after Republicans erupted over House Speaker John Boehner's decision to delay the vote

Speaking on Fox News’ Special Report on Friday, Krauthammer claimed that Boehner had done the right thing. ‘I think what Boehner did in postponing the vote until today was absolutely right,’ he said.

‘That was a rape of the Treasury. $60 billion, including a ton of pork. The part that was essential that passed today was to replenish the flood insurance. That's right, and the rest ought to be debated in regular order.’

More than two months after Superstorm Sandy struck, the House and Senate Friday approved $9.7 billion to pay flood insurance claims for the many home and business owners flooded out by the storm.

Friday morning, the House voted 354 - 67 for the bill, just days after Republicans erupted over House Speaker John Boehner's decision to delay a vote earlier in the week; all of the no votes were cast by Republicans. The Senate was passed the bill Friday afternoon.

'It's the right step,' said Rep. Rodney Frelinghuysen, R-N.J., a member of the House Appropriations Committee.

The bill gives more borrowing 
authority to the National Flood Insurance Program to pay about 115,000 
pending Sandy-related claims as well as about 5,000 claims unrelated to 
Sandy.

Northeast lawmakers say the money is 
urgently needed for victims of one of the worst storms ever to strike 
the region.

The Federal Emergency Management Agency had warned that the 
National Flood Insurance Program would run out of money next week if 
Congress didn't provide additional borrowing authority to pay out 
claims.

Congress created the FEMA-run program in 1968 because few 
private insurers cover flood damage.

The flood insurance measure is the 
first phase of a proposed Sandy aid package.

Boehner agreed to Friday's 
vote after the controversy over delaying House action on a broader Sandy
aid package.

Under Boehner's new schedule, the House will vote January 15 
on an additional $51 billion in recovery money.

The frustration, however, continued on both sides of the
aisle on Friday, as lawmakers said the flood insurance infusion would 
do little to help the bulk of those suffering more than two months after
the devastating October 29 storm.

FEMA's disaster relief fund still has about $4.3billion, enough to 
pay for recovery efforts into early spring, according to officials.

The 
unspent FEMA money can only be used for emergency services.

New York, New Jersey, Connecticut, 
District of Columbia, West Virginia, Virginia, Maryland, New Hampshire, 
Delaware, Rhode Island, Pennsylvania and Massachusetts are receiving 
federal FEMA aid.

Sandy was blamed for at least 120 
deaths and battered coastline areas from North Carolina to Maine.

New 
York, New Jersey and Connecticut were the hardest hit states and 
suffered high winds, flooding and storm surges.

The storm damaged or destroyed more 
than 72,000 homes and businesses in New Jersey.

In New York, 305,000 
housing units were damaged or destroyed and more than 265,000 businesses
were affected.

'It
took only 10 days after Katrina for President Bush to sign $60 billion 
in Katrina aid,' said New Jersey Democratic Representative Bill 
Pascrell, referring to the 2005 hurricane that devastated the Gulf 
Coast.

'How dare you come to this floor and make people think everything
is OK.'

Senate action on that measure is expected the following week; financially strapped local governments are awaiting the money.

Northeast lawmakers say the money is 
urgently needed for storm victims awaiting claim checks from the late 
October storm, which was one of the worst ever to strike the Northeast, 
ravaging the coast from North Carolina to Maine, with the most severe 
flooding occurring in Atlantic City, N.J., New York City and Long Island
and along the Connecticut coastline.

'People are waiting to be paid,' said
Rep. Frank LoBiondo, R-N.J., whose district includes Atlantic City and 
many other coastal communities hard hit by the storm.

'They're sleeping 
in rented rooms on cots somewhere, and they're not happy. They want to 
get their lives back on track, and it's cold outside. They see no 
prospect of relief.'

As with past natural disasters, the 
Sandy aid proposals do not provide for offsetting spending cuts.

Some 
tea party House Republicans and other fiscal conservatives favor cutting
other federal programs to pay for some or all disaster costs.

The Club For Growth, a conservative 
group, on Friday urged lawmakers to oppose the bill, saying that 
Congress should only approve Sandy aid in installments to make sure the 
money is wisely spent and that any new Sandy aid should be offset with 
spending cuts elsewhere.

'Congress should not allow the 
federal government to be involved in the flood insurance industry in the
first place, let alone expand the national flood insurance program's 
authority,' the group said in a statement.

Rep. Tim Huelskamp, R-Kan., a fiscal 
conservative who voted against the flood bill, said he was among those 
with concerns about the budget deficit. 'We have to talk seriously about
offsets,' Huelskamp said. 'We can't take $60 billion off budget, that's
my problem with it.'

The current debate over Sandy aid 
comes barely a year after Congress and the White House set up a new 
system to budget help for victims of hurricanes, tornadoes and floods 
before they occur.

The new disaster funding scheme permits aid money to 
be added to the budget in line with amounts budgeted in recent years.

The idea was to avoid battling and uncertainty over disaster funding.

Damage from Sandy, however, was so extensive that it's swamping the $12 billion disaster aid budget cap for the current year.

Boehner, of Ohio, had promised a 
House vote on Friday after his decision to delay an action on a broader 
Sandy relief package provoked outrage from Northeast Republicans, 
including New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie, who said he'd lost trust in 
GOP leaders in Congress after being promised a vote earlier this week.

New York Republican lawmakers who met
with Boehner after the uproar said he explained that after the 
contentious vote Tuesday to avoid major tax increases and spending cuts 
called the 'fiscal cliff,' he didn't think it was right to schedule the 
vote before the previous Congress ended on Thursday.

About 140,000 Sandy-related flood 
insurance claims have been filed, FEMA officials said, and there are 
about 115,000 pending claims.

Many flood victims have only received 
partial payments on their claims.

Sandy was the most costly natural 
disaster since Hurricane Katrina in 2005 and was blamed for at least 120
deaths.

Northeast lawmakers have complained that it took just 10 days 
for Congress to approve about $50 billion in aid for Katrina but that it
hasn't provided aid for Sandy relief in more than two months.

The storm damaged or destroyed more 
than 72,000 homes and businesses in New Jersey. In New York, 305,000 
housing units were damaged or destroyed and more than 265,000 businesses
were affected.

'States and local communities need to
know the money will be there before they can give a green light to 
start rebuilding,' said LoBiondo.

More than $2 billion in federal money 
has been spent so far on relief efforts for 11 states and the District 
of Columbia struck by the storm.

New York, New Jersey, Connecticut, West
Virginia, Virginia, Maryland, New Hampshire, Delaware, Rhode Island, 
Pennsylvania, Massachusetts and the District of Columbia are receiving 
FEMA aid.
