At first glance, these stunning artworks look like the real life animals they portray.

But a closer inspection reveals they are paintings made on a somewhat unusual canvas by a talented painter who transforms humans into amazing animals.

From alligators to foxes and even owls, artist Shannon Holt, 39, paints every hair and fleck  on to models to turn them into wildlife.

The incredible paintings, which take anywhere between six to 12.5 hours to complete, are part of her Florida Wildlife Series.

Shannon, from DeLand in Florida, US, previously worked on different surfaces such as glass, metals and wood.

But the animal advocate decided to experiment with human canvasses and incorporate animals in her work.

Shannon, who showcases her work online, said: 'I'm always searching for a new way to present what it is I do.

'The body was the final surface I tried before I decided skin was the key to making my work successful.

'People always gasp or tell me how clever the image is.

'I love it because it happened automatically and beautifully with no planning - it's a perfect creative example of how cool body painting can be.

'It can transform into two different images with the repositioning of the model's arms and hands.'

The incredible creations are the work of American artist Shannon Hol - including this Florida alligator with its baby

Unsurprisingly given the level of detail involved each piece - including these honey bees - takes between six and 12 hours to create 

Shannon, an animal lover, decided to experiment with human canvasses and incorporate animals in her work such as this blue heron

The idea to work on skin rather than canvas came naturally to Shannon as she explored other mediums. Two women join together to create a unicorn, left, and a man posts to make the image of snowy egrets, right
