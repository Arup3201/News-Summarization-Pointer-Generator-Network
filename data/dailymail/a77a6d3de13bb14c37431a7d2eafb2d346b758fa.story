Authorities say the child's body found Friday on the side of a highway in central Massachusetts is Jeremiah Oliver.

Officials said initially that the remains matched the height and weight of the 5-year-old boy who has been missing for seven months, and were able to confirm the ID Saturday after an autopsy was performed.

'It appears to be a homicide,' Worcester County District Attorney Joseph Early Jr said at a Friday news conference. The body's identification was first reported by Boston Globe.

Found dead: A body recovered near a wooded area in Massachusetts on Friday morning is said to be missing five-year-old Fitchburg boy Jeremiah Oliver.

'I don’t feel relief,' Jeremiah’s father Jose Oliver told the paper. 'I’m disappointed.'

He was notified only minutes before officials made the information public and will travel Sudnay to Massachusetts from his Connecticut home.

Early said the body was found at about 9 a.m. by a police search team about 40 feet off U.S. Highway 190 near Sterling, which is about 12 miles from Fitchburg. He said it was wrapped in blanket-like material, and packed in material that resembled a suitcase.

He would not say what led authorities to the location, or how long the body may have been there. He said the site is near an area that is regularly mowed on the side of the highway but would not have been visible to passing cars.

Jeremiah was last seen by relatives in September but wasn't reported missing until December. Authorities have said they feared he was dead.

Jeremiah's mother, Elsa Oliver, pleaded not guilty in March to charges including kidnapping, assault and battery with a dangerous weapon, and reckless endangerment. Her boyfriend pleaded not guilty to similar charges. They have been held since December on lesser charges in the case.

Jeremiah was reported missing in December after his sister told someone at her school that she and her siblings were being abused.

Emotionless: Elsa Oliver reportedly spoke to a relative recently and randomly interjected asking 'Is it the Rapture?'

The girl said the last time she saw Jeremiah his hand was bleeding for unexplained reasons, his mother Elsa was reportedly worried that he would die as a result of the hand wound.

Elsa Oliver and her boyfriend Alberto Sierra, 22, were first brought into court in December.

During the initial investigation a strange clue was offered when it was found that Elsa had a tattoo with a butterfly and the date 'Sept. 25, 2013' written below it.

Police have spoken to local tattoo artists because they want to know whether she told a tattoo artist why that date is significant.

It is not clear why it took three months for authorities to be notified of Jeremiah's disappearance, but an anonymous tip led them to believe that the mother's boyfriend may have had something to do with the alleged abuse.

A source told MailOnline that Sierra, 22, would bully and intimidate those around him, routinely becoming irate and even making death threats on more than one occasion.

Both Elsa Oliver and Alberto Sierra face multiple charges, including assault with a dangerous weapon (a belt), two counts of reckless endangerment of a child and two counts of being an accessory after the fact of a felony and assault and battery with a dangerous weapon.

The family was being monitored by state social workers since 2011. And after Jeremiah's disappearance, their case led to intense scrutiny of the state Department of Children and Families.

Three employees of the agency — a social worker, a supervisor and an area manager — were fired after an internal investigation. Officials said the social worker had not made required monthly visits to the family.

The governor asked the Child Welfare League of America to review DCF but resisted calls from some lawmakers to fire Olga Roche, the agency's commissioner.

In an initial report filed by the league last month, it recommended that Massachusetts take a number of steps to shore up its child welfare system, including boosting staffing levels to reduce social worker caseload.

A separate report from the state's Child Advocate, Gail Garinger, suggested that state social workers missed nearly one in five home visits during a recent 12-month period, though state officials said the figure was likely overstated.

Roche assured state legislators in January that DCF had accounted for the safety of all other young children in its care.

Oliver and Sierra, who were indicted by a Worcester County grand jury, are both being held on bail — $100,000 for Oliver and $250,000 for Sierra.

Three other people have been charged with interfering with a criminal investigation and misleading police in connection with the case.
