Yvette Cooper sparked a  furious row over immigration last night after accusing the Tories of using the ‘language of the National Front’.

The shadow home secretary used her speech to the Labour Party  conference to launch a ferocious attack on the Tories’ crackdown on illegal immigration.

One Conservative MP last night described Miss Cooper’s intervention as ‘despicable’, and said it showed Labour was still not serious about tackling illegal immigrants.

Controversy: The Home Office vans drove through six London boroughs as part of an initiative to reduce illegal immigration

Miss Cooper singled out a Home Office advertising campaign which warned those here illegally to ‘Go home or face arrest’.

The ads, displayed on billboards carried by vans, were trialled in several London boroughs during the summer.

Miss
Cooper also criticised immigration checks at Tube stations, which she 
said were based on racial profiling. She said both measures were 
‘divisive gimmicks’ and ‘an utter disgrace’.

She
added: ‘Unlike the Tories, we will not do checks at Tube stations 
asking British people to prove their immigration status, targeted at 
people for the colour of their skin.

Shadow home secretary Yvette Cooper told the Labour conference the part had to talk about immigration

Labour today promised to make identity theft a specific criminal offence, in a bid to stem the tide of online crime.

Shadow Home Secretary Yvette Cooper told the Labour Party conference that police are struggling to cope with net fraud.

The British Retail Consortium estimates online crime in the retail sector alone costs £200million a year.

Although fraudsters can be convicted of a series of crimes, a Labour source said the lack of an offence specifically relating to identity theft ‘leads to some confusion about how to arrest or charge people’.

Miss Cooper said: 'We live our lives online now – but criminals know that too. It’s a big risk for business. And it’s a big cost for all of us.

‘When the credit card companies and banks write off fraud we all lose out from higher charges. The problem is escalating by the day.

‘The police can’t do this alone. They don’t stand a chance. We need changes in the law to make it easier to prosecute identity theft.’

Labour would also set up a new quango, Fraudwatch, to co-ordinate action against online criminals.

‘And
unlike the Tories, we won’t do ad vans sent to the highest black  and 
ethnic British communities, borrowing the language of the 1970s National
Front.

‘Just consider 
those ad vans were driving past the homes of families whose parents and 
grandparents had to endure those same slogans scrawled high in graffiti 
40 years ago, whose children now run local businesses, work in hospitals
and schools, serve their country in our armed forces.’

Conservative
MP Nick de Bois fiercely rejected Miss Cooper’s claims and warned 
Labour could not be trusted to deal with the legacy of illegal 
immigration it had left behind.

Mr
de Bois said: ‘I am very supportive of the ad vans – we want people who
are here illegally to go home and it is in their interests to offer 
them the option of a voluntary return.

‘Yvette
Cooper’s comments are disgraceful and show just how out of touch Labour
is with public concerns about illegal immigration. They are nothing 
more than an attempt to cover up Labour’s abject failure on the issue. 
It is despicable.’

Nick
Clegg has pledged to veto any repeat of the Home Office initiative. But
polls suggest the tough message is supported by the public. A 
20,000-strong survey by former Tory treasurer Lord Ashcroft showed 79 
per cent of people backed the ‘Go home’ vans.

Vans displaying billboards warning 
overstaying migrants ‘Go home, or you'll be picked up and deported’ 
toured six London boroughs in July.

The Liberal Democrats claim not to have been consulted about the vans, with Nick Clegg insisting he will veto plans to use them nationwide.

UKIP leader Nigel Farage said they were ‘not the British way of doing things’.

Miss Cooper added: ‘It really comes to something when even (UKIP leader) Nigel Farage says you have gone too far.

‘Those ad vans were not about illegal immigration and I say enough of the divisive gimmicks, they are an utter disgrace.’

Labour’s flagship immigration policy unravelled this week, after Ed Miliband vowed to force companies which bring skilled foreign workers into the UK to also hire a ‘local’ apprentice.

But it emerged that the apprenticeships would have to be offered to anyone from within the EU.

Ms Cooper rejected the idea that Labour could not debate immigration.

She added: ‘Some people say Labour shouldn't talk about immigration. That it is pandering to prejudice or to the right. I disagree.

‘We don't have a mature and honest debate about immigration, we leave it to the divisive politics of the right.

‘That's why we have set out practical policies but I will not join an arms race of rhetoric on immigration.

‘And this party will never use immigration to play divide and rule.’

But Conservative Immigration Minister Mark Harper said: 'Conservatives have cut net immigration by a third since 2010 but shamefully Labour have opposed every single step we have taken to achieve that.

Labour let the British people down badly when they were in office with uncontrolled immigration, net migration of more than 2.2 million and abuse of the visa system which was rife.

‘It is clear that the same old Labour Party have learned nothing from their past mistakes. They have no idea how to control immigration so that it works in our national interest. They have no credibility on this issue and the British people will never trust them on it again.’
