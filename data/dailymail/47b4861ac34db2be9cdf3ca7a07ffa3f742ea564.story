A gardener  thought he was going quackers after spotting two tomatoes growing in his greenhouse - in the shape of rubber ducks.

George Wall, 80, picked the bizarrely-shaped fruit forming from a tomato plant in his back garden.

The pensioner said the deformed tomatoes had made him something of a celebrity on his street in Shrewsbury, Shropshire.

Dozens of neighbours have visited to have a look at the little red and yellow 'ducks' - which his wife Mary, 76, kept hidden to stop George eating them.

The couple are now planning to store their prized produce in their fridge - until the tomatoes rot.

The retired lorry driver said he was amazed to find not only one, but two duck-shaped tomatoes staring back up at him.

The grandfather-of-four, who has been gardening for 30 years, said: 'We were very surprised that they looked like ducks.

'We've got about eight plants in the greenhouse and as my wife went down to pick them she saw the shape of them and left them to develop.

'But they were beginning to grow too big and heavy for the plant so we picked them. 

'Mary had to keep them out of my reach while they were growing because fresh tomatoes off the plant are too tempting for me.

'It is a complete freak of nature and I don't think it will ever happen again. To get one is rare enough but to get two little ducks was incredible.'

Mrs Wall added: 'I couldn't get rid of them, they are just too cute.

'I have kept them in the fridge and they are starting to go off, but there's no way we'd use them.

'When I first spotted them I said to my daughter I was growing a duck in the greenhouse and she didn't believe me.

'I went and brought them to

'We've never grown anything like them before and doubt we will again.'

They are not the first people to find strange-shaped fruit and vegetables in their gardens. 

 In 2008, John Owen, of Brownhills, Staffordshire, found a red tomato growing in the shape of a duck - and added white stickers as eyes. 

In the same year, Patricia Bragg from Essex found a mallard-shaped courgette - which bore an uncanny resemblance to Beatrix Potter character Jemima Puddleduck - nestling among leaves in her allotment.
