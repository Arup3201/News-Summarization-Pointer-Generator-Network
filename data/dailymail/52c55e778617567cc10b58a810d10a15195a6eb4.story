Police officers who filmed themselves doing the Harlem Shake in uniform have faced disciplinary action from unimpressed bosses.

The six Metropolitan Police traffic officers were filmed performing the dance craze at the end of a shift in an underground car park.

But it seems the amusing video, which was shared on YouTube, has failed to raise a laugh from Scotland Yard bosses, who launched an investigation into the 'misconduct'.

The video shows one police officer in a motorcycle helmet slowly dancing, surrounded by his five colleagues who appear to ignore him.

But when the beat drops, his co-workers suddenly join in.

It shows the officers gyrating against a police van, cycling in circles, and even donning a road cone as they dance to the beat.

A Met spokesman said it first became aware of the video in February, when the Professional standards unit launched an investigation.

Six of the PCSOs were given written warnings, and one has now resigned, prior to a gross misconduct board relating to the video as well as other matters.

A Scotland Yard spokesman said: 'The Metropolitan Police Service does not condone unprofessionalism in the workplace.

'We expect high standards from all our staff.

'Appropriate misconduct procedures have been taken regarding those involved.'

The Harlem Shake song was originally released in May 2012, but the online phenomenon was born on January 30th, when one video blogger posted a video of himself and three others dressed in colourful latex suits dancing to the song.

Created by Harry Rodrigues, aka DJ Baauer, video tributes to the song have collectively generated 175million views to date.

Unlike 2012's Gangnam Style internet dance craze, the Harlem Shake does not involve any specific dance moves and is instead more of a free-for-all, often leading to hilarious results.

In one video, a troop of Norwegian soldiers is seen lining up in formation.

One of the soldiers begins dancing, and 20 seconds into the video the other soldiers - who are suddenly wearing skis, standing on their heads or wrapped up in sleeping bags on the ground - join in on the dance.

Another video sees the crew and animals of San Antonio Sea World, all bopping their heads and shaking their fins to the beat of the tune.

But Scotland Yard is not the only organisation to fail to see the funny side.

An Oxford University librarian lost her job after students filmed themselves doing the latest dance craze on her watch.

Calypso Nash, 23, was dismissed from St Hilda’s College after a video that shows students noisily performing a ‘Harlem Shake’ in the college library appeared on YouTube.
