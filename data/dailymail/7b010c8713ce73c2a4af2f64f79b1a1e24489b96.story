'I don't deal with stress well,' admitted Spelling, who also spent six days in the hospital for a migraine back in April. 

'My whole life, I would just repress [it] and keep going and no one knew, really. 

'And it would just start coming out. I would be sick all the time - sinus, migraines, everything. 

'I don't want to keep going on like that. 

'I'm at that place where I don't like the way my kids see me. I don't like them seeing me as sick.'
