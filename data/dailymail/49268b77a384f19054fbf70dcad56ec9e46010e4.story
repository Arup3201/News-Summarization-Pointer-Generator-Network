The derby clash between Everton and Liverpool next month will kick-off at 5.30pm as scheduled despite opposition from Merseyside Police and the local council, the Premier League has confirmed.

The fixture on Saturday, February 7 at Goodison Park, was moved to a tea-time start in order to be televised by Sky Sports - leading to objections from the police, who decided to elevate the game to a Category C fixture, with reference to there being a high risk of disorder.

The police, supported by Liverpool City Council's Licensing Committee, wanted the match to kick-off no later than 1.30pm.

The kick-off time of the Merseyside derby between Everton and Liverpool remains unchanged - 5.30pm

Everton informed the Premier League on December 9 of the police's objections and the issue was then discussed by the council's licensing committee, which initially said it would 'take legal advice on all appropriate options to enforce the position' in the event of no change of kick-off time being determined.

However, only if there are concerns over a safety certificate being issued could a change be viable, and that was not a consideration as Everton have confirmed they are in a position to stage the game.

And the Premier League confirmed to Mailonline Sport on Monday that the derby will go ahead at the 5.30pm start.

Merseyside Police's report last month stressed there was no specific intelligence indicating any organised disorder is planned but stated the wider implications of a late kick-off meant they had to take action.
