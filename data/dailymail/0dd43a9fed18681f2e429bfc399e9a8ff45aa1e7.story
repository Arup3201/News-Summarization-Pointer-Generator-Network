A girl aged seven was taped to her chair in class during a humiliating bullying campaign by her teacher and classroom assistant, a court heard yesterday.

The pupil is also said to have been shut in a store room and had Post-it notes attached to her thumbs to prevent her from sucking them.

Other children in the class laughed as the girl was subjected to the supposedly ‘good-humoured’ pranks by teacher Deborah McDonald, 41, and classroom assistant Rachael Regan, 43. 

Teaching assistant Rachael Regan, 43, (right) and teacher Deborah McDonald, 41, (left) are accused of taping a seven-year-old pupil to a chair and shut her in a storeroom during a five-month campaign of bullying

Police investigated the child’s treatment after she ran out of the school crying and her mother complained.

The prosecution said she was ‘singled out and bullied on a regular basis’ over a five-month period by both members of staff at the primary school in Calderdale, West Yorkshire.

The court heard Regan used Sellotape, which was wrapped around the girl more than once, to fasten her to the chair for around ten minutes, with her arms by her sides.

Simon Waley, prosecuting, told the jury: ‘She said that Mrs Regan put it all around the chair and it was hard breathing. She said that she couldn’t get out to reach her things. She said that the whole class were laughing.’

The girl came out of school at home time in a distressed state before telling her mother she had been tied to a chair with tape by a teacher and she could not move. 

She said the other pupils laughed at her and she was the ‘class clown’. The teaching assistant later said that she did it for ‘a bit of fun’ because the girl had been ‘fidgety’ the court heard. 

Bradford Crown Court heard that the girl told the police Regan (right) taped her to a chair, while McDonald (left) made a calendar  which included a number of comments and photographs of the girl

Mr Waley said the girl also told police of an incident in which Regan had bound string to her legs and feet to keep her shoes on. He added: ‘She said it was horrible and that, again, everybody had been laughing.’ Other alleged incidents included Regan and McDonald goading the girl with biscuits. 

Other children had been given biscuits for good homework, the court heard, but she was left out and the defendants told her how delicious they were.

Regan is said to have pulled a photograph of the seven-year-old off the wall and ripped it to pieces in front of her. And McDonald allegedly kicked the girl’s chair when she was swinging on it, causing it to ‘jerk forward’.

The teacher is said to have dropped the victim’s doll into a drawer before kicking it shut. She also made a calendar to give to colleagues, which allegedly included comments and photos of the girl. 

The court was told that both Regan (rightt) and McDonald (left) 'were playing their part in this course of conduct, even if they did not each play a physical role in each of the acts complained of'

McDonald, from Halifax, and Regan, from Illingworth, went on trial at Bradford Crown Court after denying child cruelty.

The alleged bullying took place between September 2012 and January last year. The court heard the women were jointly to blame.

Mr Waley said: ‘The prosecution say that they wilfully ill-treated her, in that they pursued a course of conduct in which their systematic treatment of her amounted to bullying. Both were playing their part in this course of conduct, even if they did not each play a physical role in each of the acts complained of.’ 

Simon Waley, prosecuting, told Bradford Crown Court the defendants gave the children biscuits for good homework but did not include the girl as she had not completed hers 

The women were arrested in February last year after the mother complained to the school and the police were called in.

Mr Waley said that Regan was questioned about the taping incident and told police that in ‘hindsight’ she ‘shouldn’t have done it but thought it was going to be a bit of fun’.

He added: ‘The defendant said that she thought she had a really good relationship with the girl. She said she was a cheeky monkey. She denied that she and McDonald had ever bullied the girl.’

Mr Waley said the defence accepted that some incidents took place, but argued they were fun rather than malicious and the girl ‘had been a participant in the humour’. The prosecutor added: ‘These were not episodes of fun but rather a course of conduct amounting to cruelty.’

The girl, who cannot be identified for legal reasons, is now aged nine.The trial continues.
