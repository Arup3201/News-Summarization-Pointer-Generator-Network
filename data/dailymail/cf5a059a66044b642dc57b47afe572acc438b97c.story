Fresh shame has been heaped on the council at the centre of the Baby P scandal, after a child placed in care by the authority was left behind on a London bus by its foster parent.

Passengers are said to have called police after spotting the child, believed to be aged under two, left alone in its buggy on the single-decker bus in Enfield on Friday.

A spokesperson at Haringey Council - which was slammed for its failings in the care of abused baby Peter Connolly - said the child had been removed from the care of the foster parent and an investigation launched into the incident.

Investigation: The child, who had been placed in care by Haringey Council, was abandoned on a bus by its foster parent on Friday

'Yes there was a foster carer who left a child on a bus and the child was in care of Haringey Council, and there is an investigation in progress into the incident,' the spokesperson said.

'My understanding is the child was left for a short period on the bus and the child has now been removed from the care of the foster parent.'

According to a report in the Sun, the female carer got off the single-decker 491 bus in Enfield on Friday afternoon, leaving the child behind on its own.

When passengers raised the alarm, the child was checked over in hospital before being returned to social services in Haringey, the report said.

The carer, who later got in touch with emergency services, is not thought to have been looking after any other children on behalf of the authority.

David Skelton, from the think tank Policy Exchange, called for an overhaul of the fostering system.

'There are too many cases of the most vulnerable young people being let down,' he told the newspaper.Â 

A Metropolitan Police spokesman 
confirmed police had been called after a baby was left on a bus, and 
said no arrests had been made.

Baby P: Haringey Council was engulfed by scandal in the wake of the death of baby Peter Connolly

Peter Connolly was found dead in his cot in August 2007 after behind subjected to horrific abuse by his mother, Tracey Connolly, her sadistic boyfriend Steven Barker, and his brother Jason Owen.

The 17-month-old died even though he was on Haringey Council's 'at risk' list and in spite of more than 60 visits from social workers, police and health staff over a period of eight months.

Baby Peter's death shocked Britain and led to sweeping reforms to children's services.
