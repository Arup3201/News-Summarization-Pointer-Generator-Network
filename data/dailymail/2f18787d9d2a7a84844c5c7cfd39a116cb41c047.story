Burberry chief executive Angela Ahrendts is one of three women on a board of eight directors

Firms which employ higher numbers of female executives make more money, research suggests.

A new report found companies where women make up a third of board members made on average 42 per cent more profit, while shareholders received 53 per cent higher returns.

Catering services firm Sodexo compiled wide-ranging research on diversity at work and found that hiring more women in senior roles boosted business’s performance.

However, the report found that tokenism did not work and that firms needed to hire multiple female managers in order to benefit.

It pointed to research by Catalyst which showed firms with three or more female directors had a profit margin of 16.8 per cent, compared with 11.5 per cent for the average company.

Debbie White, 51, chief executive of Sodexo UK & Ireland, said: ‘One woman around the table won’t improve company performance.

‘You have to overcome the lone-voice syndrome for diversity to be successful.’

The number of women in Britain’s boardrooms has grown from 6.2 per cent in 1999 to 17.3 per cent this year, among the companies listed on the FTSE 100.

Burberry has the highest proportion of female directors on its board with three out of eight, including chief executive Angela Ahrendts.

Sodexo’s report, which will be published in full next month, said mixed gender boards brought ‘business benefits’, but warned against rigid Government quotas.

It said: ‘What is becoming increasingly important and being mentioned more and more, by both males and females alike, is that this must not become a numbers game.

‘Reaching quotas and targets for the sake of reaching quotas is not beneficial to anyone.

‘Appointing female board members should be about the richness of the board as a whole - the combined contribution of a group of people with different skills and perspectives.’

The report said the increase in female directors had stalled in recent months, however, saying: ‘evidence suggests this could be starting to slow’.

In 2011, the Government told companies to double the number of women on their boards within four years, or face government intervention.

It followed a report by Lord Davies’ which recommended the UK should have 25 per cent women on FTSE 100 boards by 2015.

Business Secretary Vince Cable said earlier this year: ‘The argument for more women in our boardrooms is clear - they bring fresh perspectives and ideas, talent and broader experience which leads to better decision-making.

‘This is not just about equality at the top of our companies. It is about good business sense.’
