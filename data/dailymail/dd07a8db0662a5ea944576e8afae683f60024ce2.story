He lives in Queens, he's neurotic and he lives with his aunt.

Of course Spider-Man is Jewish, says British-raised actor Andrew Garfield.

The 30-year-old, who grew up in Surrey, has revealed he is convinced the Marvel superhero - like him - has Jewish roots.

Garfield was brought up Jewish and has argued that the character traits of Spidey and his alter ego Peter Parker are an undisputable sign that the character is Jewish.

However, it seems he may not take his faith too seriously.

The producers of Garfield's film The Amazing Spider-Man 
2, which opens this week, angered the Hasidic population of the New York
 neighbourhood of Williamsburg, when they shut down streets to film 
during last year's Jewish holiday of Passover.

Garfield told Time Out: 'Peter Parker is not a simple dude. He can't just switch off. He never feels like he's doing enough. And Peter suffers from self-doubt.

'He ums and ahs about his future because he's neurotic. He's Jewish. It's a defining feature. He's an over-thinker. It would be much easier if he was a life-saving robot.'

He added: 'I hope Jewish people won't mind the cliche, because my father's Jewish. I have that in me for sure.

Rabbis in New York have claimed for years that Spidey was part of 'the tribe'

'He is misunderstood, like Jesus. I don't mind the Jesus parallel for Spider-man. Jesus is an awesome guy. When Pontius Pilate said: "They say you're the son of God. If you're the son of God tell me." Jesus was like: "I know who I am, bitch".'

The star, who now lives in Los Angeles, said: 'Peter (Parker) is not that evolved. Peter wants to tell the world he's a good guy: "Like me, I'm nice."

'He's a 19 year-old kid. He's a kid struggling with being misunderstood. We've all been misunderstood. That's universal too. I like being Peter.'

Rabbis in New York have claimed for years that Spidey was part of 'the tribe'. Indeed, the character was created in 1962 by Stan Lee, a Jewish-American.

He even compared the web-slinger to the biblical figure of David. In the Book of Samuel, King Saul sends soldiers to kill David, who finds a cave and weaves a giant web to hide from them.

Lee wrote:  'To me you can wrap all of Judaism up in one sentence, and that is "Do not do unto others…" All I tried to do in my stories was show that there's some innate goodness in the human condition. And there's always going to be evil; we should always be fighting evil.'
