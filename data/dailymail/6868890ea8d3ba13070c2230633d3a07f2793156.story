The British father-of-two facing death at the hands of Islamic State fanatics has spent his career as an aid worker helping to protect innocent civilians across the Third World.

For more than two decades, David Haines has travelled with aid agencies through Syria, Libya, the former Yugoslavia and South Sudan.

He has dedicated his life to promoting peace in places of violent conflict and has overseen projects to save civilians from land mines.

The 44-year-old has been described as a hero by his family, who have been inspired by him to travel the world themselves on aid missions.

Hero: David Haines has travelled with aid agencies through Syria, Libya, former Yugoslavia and South Sudan

Mr Haines was born in Holderness in East Yorkshire, before being brought up in Perth, Scotland, by his parents Herbert, 77, and Mary, 79.

He studied at Perth Academy before, at the age of 17, joining the military where he enjoyed a 12-year career.

Despite getting married to his first wife Louise when he was 22 – and having his first daughter five years later – Mr Haines was determined to continue working across the world to help civilians trapped in war-torn countries.

Between 1999 and 2004, he was at a German NGO helping to revive abandoned villages and to return refugees to their homes after the civil war in the former Yugoslavia. 

The work led to swift promotion and he left a few years later to become an independent consultant, spreading his experience in dealing with security to various charities and organisations.

He worked as a consultant director for manufacturing company Astraea, based in Croatia, and went to Libya three years ago, working with Handicap International on demining programmes.

A year later, the aid worker travelled to South Sudan, where he was a security manager for Nonviolent Peaceforce, a civilian peacekeeping group.

Wanting more freedom and a shorter-term contract, Mr Haines left to join French non-governmental organisation ACTED, or the Agency for Technical Cooperation and Development, which works to support civilians affected by wars, natural disasters and economic and social crises.

He was with the organisation in Syria when he was kidnapped with a colleague in March last year by IS forces near the Atmeh refugee camp, by the Turkish border.

Aid workers desperately tried to secure Mr Haines’s release and his family in Scotland spoke of their devastation at his capture.

The hostage’s 17-year-old daughter in Perth has described her agony in a series of online posts over the past year.

She has planned a gap year doing aid work in the Third World, inspired by her ‘hero’.

‘I miss my dad. I would do anything to have him home,’ she wrote last year.

In an online question-and-answer forum, she was asked what she wanted most in her life. The schoolgirl replied: ‘To have my dad home for good.’

In March, Mr Haines’s daughter uploaded a picture of a Fathers’ Day card she had written him, stating: ‘Hey Daddy, just because you’re not here doesn’t mean you should miss out.’

Alongside the card was a picture of them together when she was a little girl.

She also uploaded a photograph of him cradling his younger daughter from his second marriage to Croatian Dragana Prodanovic in 2010. The child is now four.

Mr Haines’s elder daughter described her father as her ‘biggest influence’ and her ‘idol’, adding: ‘It’s been a really tough year without my dad. I think heroes exist, but they don’t all show off in a stupid cape.

‘This sounds really cheesy, but I think my dad’s a hero.’

Pressure: David Cameron and Barack Obama now face a race against time to recover David Haines and stem the Islamic State's murderous rampage after two US journalists were killed

Mr Haines’s relatives has been informed that he is the hostage featured in the barbaric IS video in which American journalist Steven Sotloff was beheaded.

On Tuesday evening, members of the family travelled to his parents’ home in Ayr to come to terms with the news together.

They are being updated on his fate by Downing Street officials.

Mr Haines’s wife has also posted heart-breaking pictures online – many of their wedding day – and a series of photographs of his toddler wearing T-shirts bearing the words ‘I love my dad’ and ‘Daddy’s girl’.

She has also posted a song called Far Away, with a note reading: ‘For my hubby... far away... miss you darling.’

The couple had been living near Zagreb and running a supplies business. Mr Haines is believed to have been abducted in Syria along with Italian aid worker Federico Motka, 31, who was also doing relief work for ACTED with Syrian civilians affected by conflict.

Mr Motka was released in May. He said he had been tortured and moved six times.

Afterwards, an ACTED spokesman said: ‘Our thoughts go towards all of those, humanitarian workers and journalists among others, still held hostage in Syria and throughout the world.’

Threat: The 44-year-old is now facing murder at the hands of ISIS, who captured him in March 2013

One of Mr Haines’s former colleagues said when she saw the IS video: ‘My heart went into my throat.’ 

Tiffany Easthom, the South Sudan country director for Nonviolent Peaceforce, added: ‘I just felt ill.

‘He was hard working, very caring and had a good sense of humour. He decided, when he finished with the military, he still wanted to contribute, so he did it from a civilian perspective working for NGOs.

‘He decided to contribute to the humanitarian world from the civilian perspective.

‘He was up for the challenge. He was willing to sleep in tents and build compounds in the jungle for our team. A fellow he was abducted with was released a couple of months ago. We were hopeful that he would be released soon.’

She said Mr Haines was ‘very familiar with insecure locations’.

Describing her former colleague’s appearance in the IS video, she said: ‘He looks thinner. I guess that’s not surprising, but it’s a pretty horrible thing.

‘This is a conflict that has taken on a whole new level of brutality that we haven’t seen before.

‘Let’s just hope that there’s a positive outcome for David and everyone else who doesn't have their freedom.’
