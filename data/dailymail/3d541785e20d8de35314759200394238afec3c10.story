It really may be a case of in one ear and out the other.

Research shows we have a poor memory for sound.

As a result, we find it easier to remember things we see or touch than those we hear.

The researchers recommend that we write down things we want to remember – and supplement the words with pictures.

Scientists at the University of Iowa found that teachers should use more visual aids if they want pupils to remember what they are telling them as we find it easier to remember things we see, rather than hear

To make the finding, US scientists asked a group of students to listen to pairs of beeps and say if the two were identical.

The time lag between the beeps in each pair was gradually increased and the accuracy of their answers noted.

Visual memory was measured by doing the task with pictures and to test memory for touch, the students repeatedly a gripped a bar that vibrated at different rates.

In the very short-term, all three types of memory were equally good.

But within just four to eight seconds, the students clearly found it harder to remember the beeps than the pictures or vibrations.

The finding could help explain why it is so hard to remember a phone number if you don’t write it down.

Researcher Amy Poremba, of the University of Iowa, said: ‘If someone gives you a number, and you dial it right away, you are usually fine. But do anything in between, and the odds are you will have forgotten it.’

Dr Poremba then did a second experiment using scenarios more akin to everyday life.

Students listened to recordings of dogs barking, watched silent videos of a basketball game, and picked up coffee mugs and other common objects hidden from view.

The students remembered the videos and mugs and objects equally well. However, they  recordings were more of a struggle.

Writing in the journal PLOS ONE, Dr Poremba said the results suggest that the way the mind processes and stores sound may be different from the way it process and stores other types of memories.

She said: ‘We tend to think that the parts of our brain wired for memory are integrated.

‘But our findings indicate our brain may use separate pathways to process information.

‘Even more, our study suggests the brain may process auditory information differently than visual and tactile information, and alternative strategies - such as increased mental repetition - may be needed when trying to improve memory.

‘As teachers, we want to assume students will remember everything we say. But if you really want something to be memorable you may need to include a visual or hands-on experience, in addition to auditory information.’

With previous work showing that monkeys and chimps also find it harder to recall things they have heard, it is thought the weakness has its roots in the evolution of the primate brain.
