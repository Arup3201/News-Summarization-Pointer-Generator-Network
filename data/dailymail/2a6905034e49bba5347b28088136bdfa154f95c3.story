Controversial: Hertz installed the cameras as part of the in-car NeverLost app in 2014

Car rental company Hertz has been slammed by customers for putting cameras inside their vehicles.

The controversial device was installed as part of the in-car navigation system and guide, NeverLost 6 app, which was introduced in 2014.

Drivers fear the lens is a breach of their privacy, but the firm insist they do not work and have no plans to turn them on.

They also state they do not have the bandwidth capabilities to support video streaming.

The cameras were added so drivers could interact with a member of the customer services team during an emergency or when stationary.

To start a conversation, the motorist or a passenger would have been able to turn on the camera themselves - but because of technical difficulties the feature hasn't been integrated into the system. 

Rich Broome, a spokesman for Hertz, told the Daily Mail Online it would have been completely customer activated and could not have been turned on remotely. 

He added that there is 'nothing behind the lens' and there is no timetable to connect the device. 

However some drivers who regularly rent from Hertz have still expressed their concern at the camera's presence.

One customer wrote on the forum Flyertalk: 'I am a regular renter from Hertz (President's Circle). This week after the usual excessive wait for the Hertz airport shuttle, I got into a rental car at O'Hare airport. 

'I immediately noticed the new NeverLost and I was completely shocked to see a camera built into the device looking at me. The system can't be turned off from what could tell. Further investigation revealed that the camera can see the entire inside of the car. 

'I know rental car companies have been tracking the speed and movements of their vehicles for years but putting a camera inside the cabin of the vehicle is taking their need for information a little too far. 

Breach of privacy? Some drivers have expressed their concern at the presence of the device, but the hire car firm said there is 'nothing behind the lens' and the camera simply doesn't work 

'I find this to be completely unacceptable In fact, if I get another car from Hertz with a camera in it, I will move our business from Hertz completely. I influence car rentals of many others and I don't think anyone would want to be on camera while they are driving around or sitting at a red light. 

'Given what Hertz has invested in this system, I wonder how much consumer pressure will make them to pull the plug on this. Business is built one customer at a time and they will no longer have me as a customer.'

The company told a Twitter user who criticized the use of the lens: 'The camera in the NeverLost device was never activated as we do not have adequate bandwidth capabilities to the car to support streaming video at this time.'

Mr Broome added that if any customer has any concerns with the device, they can simply switch to another car. 

Only 20 per cent of the cars have a camera inside.

It is not the first time in-car recording technology has caused a stir.  

Last year Chevrolette released a new Corvette with a 'nanny cam' inside - aimed at keeping an eye on suspicious valets.

But General Motors were forced to send an advisory to customers warning them not to use the product as it is illegal in some states.
