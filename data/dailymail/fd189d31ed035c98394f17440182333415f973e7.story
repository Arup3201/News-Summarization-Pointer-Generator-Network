A chilling 911 call made from inside the Ohio home where a mother allegedly beheaded her three-month-old daughter has revealed the chaotic scene after the body was found.

Deasia Watkins, 20, had gone to bed after allegedly decapitating her baby, Janiyah, and repeatedly stabbing her body, leaving relatives to find the girl's remains early on Monday.

Watkins' aunt, who had custody of the child, made the 911 call.

'Somebody please send the police!' the aunt can be heard begging in the call, which was obtained by the Washington Post. 'My niece killed our baby! Please! Help me!'

Through sobs, the woman explains she was sleeping when her adult son brought his children over to her house to be picked up for school and discovered the body.

'My son came in here and woke me up and said, "Momma the baby's dead",' she explains.

Overcome with emotion, she is unable to speak and her son takes the phone. The 911 dispatcher presses him for details about what happened. 

'Lady, the baby is on my mom's kitchen counter with its head smashed,' the man says. 'Can you please just send the police as fast as you can.'

He adds that he does not know where his cousin - Watkins - is and pleads with the dispatcher to send police before the young woman is able to hurt herself. 

Trying to piece together what has happened, the dispatcher asks the man if the baby is breathing.

'Listen lady, the baby is deceased,' he says, as his mother wails in the background.

When the dispatcher pushes for more details, he says bluntly: 'Look, lady. I don't want to describe the scene. The [scene] is very, very bad, alright? The little baby's head is open. Like, open open. 

Scene: Watkins was staying at her aunt's College Hill, Ohio home (pictured) when she allegedly murdered the baby. Police found Watkins in bed and covered in blood when they responded to her aunt's 911 call

'I'm not going in there to touch nothing, because I don't want to mess nothing up. I'm not going in there to look, because I've already seen it. But it's very violent. It's a very violent scene.' 

Police arrived at the College Hill home to find the decapitated baby. The child had been stabbed 15 times and had a fractured arm, and the knife had been placed in her hand.

Watkins was found covered in blood and asleep in a bedroom and was arrested for aggravated murder. She was taken to hospital for mental evaluation.

Hamilton County prosecutor Joe Deters said that Watkins, who is under guard at Deaconess Hospital, is not talking to authorities.

'She's like a zombie,' he told WCPO. 'We're hoping to get her some medication so she can begin talking.

'Until she gets in front of some doctors and talks, it's going to be very difficult to know what her motivation was. No matter what the motivation was, no one is going to be able to explain this.' 

The horrific killing came after Watkins had been forbidden to have contact with the child after she was hospitalized for psychiatric problems, authorities said. 

Shock: Janiyah's father, James Brown, said his girlfriend started acting differently a month after the baby's birth. He had also been ordered to keep away from the child, who authorities said was neglected

But the aunt had apparently let Watkins move in with her and the baby a week earlier. Authorities were unaware of this because they could not constantly monitor the home, Deters said.

Watkins gave birth to her daughter in December.

James Brown, who authorities believe to be the baby's father, told WCPO he had been dating Watkins for two years but about a month after the birth of the child, she 'just started acting different'. 

He said she had been 'acting crazy lately, speaking of demons', according to a court document.

She was hospitalized when police responded to a report of her screaming and the baby crying at their apartment on January 24, according to documents.

In a 911 call, a neighbor tells a dispatcher: 'There's an infant screaming and then the mom's yelling at the baby, telling it to shut up... it's been going on for about an hour,' WCPO reported.

Watkins appeared to be under the influence of marijuana and refused to let go of the child, court documents said. But Janiyah was taken by emergency personnel after Watkins passed out.

Friend Chris Gulley was also at the apartment at the time and told WCPO that Watkins was calling him and Brown the devil. 

Victim: Authorities found the mother had placed the knife in baby Janiyah's hand after killing her on Monday

Tragedy: Janiyah also had multiple stab wound to her face and a broken arm, authorities have said

'She kept saying we were sinning so much, we didn't realize we were sinning,' Gulley said. 'We need to come to the light and see what God wanted us to do and all that.'

She was hospitalized briefly and diagnosed with postpartum psychosis. Doctors declared her unsafe around the child unless she took prescribed medication, court documents state. 

On March 6, a juvenile court magistrate the girl to be taken from her mother for the child's protection and placed in the custody of Hamilton County Job and Family Services.

Brown, whose paternity has not been established, was also ordered to stay away from the child when the court found both parents neglectful.

Deters said at the press conference on Tuesday that family services had done their jobs 'but you don't have the resources to be in the house 24/7'.

He added that he wasn't sure anyone else would be charged. The aunt may be needed as a witness, he said.

WCPO reported that Watkin's only previous brush with the law was a fine for disorderly conduct.
