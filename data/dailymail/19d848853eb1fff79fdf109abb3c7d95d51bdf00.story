The distraught son of the teacher killed when a coach full of school children crashed in France has told mourners at his funeral: 'My heart is broken'.

Peter Rippington's family were joined by hundreds wishing to pay their last respects during a public ceremony yesterday.

His wife of 28 years, Sharon - still bearing the signs of the horrific coach crash - daughter Amy and his son Max, were visibly moved as they heard how the popular teacher had ‘touched hundreds, if not thousands, of lives'.

The 59-year-old maths and games 
teacher was killed on February 19 when a coach bringing pupils from 
Alvechurch CE Middle School crashed on its way back from a skiing trip 
in Italy.

In a moving tribute Max said: 'My dad has left a gaping hole in our family that will never be filled.

'My
heart is broken that I am unable to see, speak to and hug my dad again.
My dad’s legacy will continually live on in me and in every life he 
touched.

'He will never be forgotten and will stay in our hearts forever.'

‘I
could talk for hours about stories such as these that made my dad one 
in a million but I'm sure you will agree we wouldn't have changed him 
for the world.’

The picturesque grounds of  Parish Church of St. Laurence in Alvechurch, Worcestershire, could hardly contain the hundreds of people want to pay
tribute to the life of ‘Mr Alvechurch’ - a nickname given to the 
teacher who was born in the village and taught at Alvechurch CE Middle 
School for 31 years. 

Mourners were forced to pack the corridors and or listen to tributes to the teacher from outside.

Promising football player Amy, captain
of West Bromwich Albion’s ladies team, urged the congregation to 
remember her dad in the happy way he would have wanted.

'It’s so hard to try and sum dad up as he simply had too many qualities,' she said.

'Kind, thoughtful, caring, loving and generous are some of the words that spring to mind but one that sticks out is "selfless".

'Our dad always put everyone else’s needs before his own and would not rest until he knew everyone was happy.

'My dad would have wanted things this way as he would never have forgiven himself if anybody else had lost their life.'

Tributes: Mr Rippington was affectionately known as 'Mr Rip' by the countless pupils he taught

Thanksgiving: Friends and family told of their touching memories of Mr Rippington

'My dad took the main impact of that crash to ensure that others were saved and that just sums up the man he is.'

Amy
then concluded their tribute with a poem entitled ‘My father the Hero’ 
that she wrote in hospital following the crash - which also injured her 
mother Sharon.

Before the service, at the the hearse 
passed through the school gates where he taught as pupils and colleagues
paid their respects.

During the service, which was opened 
with ‘Tears in Heaven’ by Eric Clapton, the congregation could often be 
heard bursting into laughter as friends and colleagues recalled stories 
about their experiences with the loveable teacher.

And
it seemed Peter’s brother, Paul Rippington, best captured the mood of 
the service when he said: 'Whenever I spoke to my friends or co-workers I
always and instinctively said the same thing, I don’t know anyone with 
more friends than my brother.

'He
was the one to organise pub quizzes. He was the one who too the 
students on so many trips.

'He was the one who coached the sports teams.

'He was the one who refereed and umpired so kids could play.' As
well the tributes from his brother, and ones from his friends, Stuart 
Baxter, Chris Stock and John Hague, their was also a moving speech by 
the headteacher of Alvechurch CE Middle School, Karen Jordan.

After a public ceremony, Mr Rippington's family went on to a private cremation

'Rip
joined Alvechurch Middle School about a year before I did so we learned
much together. He became much, much more than a colleague over the 30 
years we taught together,' she said.

'I
have lost count over the number of visits that I went on with him and 
the fun we had and the time he so enjoyed with the children.

'He always 
wanted them to have memorable experiences. They were his reason for 
being.

In his address to the congregation, the rector of the village, the Reverend David Martin, said: ‘Some people live just for their own family, but Peter was not of that ilk.

‘His family embraced the 3,000 children whom he had taught over the years, the young people he had refereed and umpired on the sports field, and the enormous number of friends he had.’

'Mr Rippington had truly lived for 
others.

He added: ‘This has been 
shown by the huge outpouring of love and sympathy that has taken place 
over the past two weeks.’

Mr Rip, as he was 
affectionately known by the generations of families he taught over three
decades at the village school, was famous for being the heart and soul 
of the community.

Not only 
did he organise football teams, basketball teams and take children on 
trips to Alton Towers, Waterworld or Italy to ski, he also refereed at 
weekends in six different football leagues and was a qualified mountain 
leader.

Mr Rippington was described as an 'inspirational' teacher the children affectionately called 'Mr Rip'

After hearing the 
closing music The Long and Winding Road by John Lennon and Paul 
McCartney, mourners filed out of their church behind the coffin in their
hundreds - many of them in tears after paying their respects to a 
teacher who dedicated his life to the community.

The funeral was followed by a private family cremation.

Coach driver Derek Thompson, 47, is thought to have nodded off before the crash, which happened as pupils and teachers from Alvechurch Church of England Middle School in Worcestershire were returning from a half-term ski trip to Italy.

Investigators believe his foot slipped off the accelerator, causing the coach to slow down before it flipped over a crash barrier and into a ditch.

They said the vehicle’s tachograph revealed an ‘unjustified’ change in speed from 60mph to 50mph immediately before the crash.

Clues: French gendarmes inspect the damaged bus. A local police spokesman, said they believed the driver fell asleep at the wheel

The bus struck a safety barrier and rolled into a ditch as it travelled on the A26 motorway, near the town of Chalons-en-Champagne, 90 miles east of Paris
