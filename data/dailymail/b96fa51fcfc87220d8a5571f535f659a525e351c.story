Primark showed yesterday that it is not all doom and gloom on the high street as it delivered bumper Christmas sales figures.

The discount fashion chain was the star performer over the festive period as others around it collapsed into administration.

The good news was echoed at Argos while soaring sales of tablet computers helped Currys and PC World to a bumper Christmas.

Primark bosses hinted that the chain had won yet more middle-class customers from troubled rival Marks & Spencer.

Shoes, scarves, Christmas-themed jumpers and ‘onesies’ helped Primark to a 9 per cent rise in sales, excluding recently opened stores.

When the group’s 14 store openings in Europe, including its second shop on Oxford Street in central London, are taken into account the figures are even better.

There was a 25 per cent increase in total sales at the chain over the 16 weeks to January 5, compared with the same period of 2011-2012.

This was a much stronger performance than M&S which disappointed with a 3.8 per cent fall in clothing sales compared with the same period of the year before.

Its boss, Marc Bolland, refused to slash prices in an attempt to boost profit and shoppers flocked to other cheaper chains such as Primark.

John Bason, finance director of Primark’s parent company Associated British Foods, said: ‘It has wide appeal for Middle England and is as popular with young people and across all socio-economic groups.

‘Primark has a wide range of prices and items on offer so to try and pigeon hole our success on one group of customers is missing the point.’

The past seven days has seen an extraordinary rash of retail chains collapse into administration with HMV, Blockbuster and Jessops all failing, placing more than 10,000 jobs at risk.

But Argos, Britain’s biggest household goods retailer, was a surprise success. It launched an enhanced website which allowed its customers to pay for their goods online and pick them up in-store. Internet sales now account for 42 per cent of the total.

Yesterday the chain credited that – as well as the popularity of new tablet and smartphone applications – for its strong Christmas performance.

After a recent spate of profit warnings, Terry Duddy, boss of parent company Home Retail Group, said annual profit would be £10million ahead of the £73million expected.

Rival Dixons, the owner of PC World and Currys, also benefited from the drive to technology.It said it shifted five tablet computers a second in the week before Christmas.

The firm, which benefited from the demise of rivals BestBuy and Comet, saw an 8 per cent increase in sales excluding recently-opened stores for the 12 weeks to January 5.

But it was a different story at struggling Mothercare which said its sales fell over Christmas.

The group has closed 11 loss-making stores – but said that sales in remaining shops were still down 5.9 per cent in the 13 weeks to January 12.
