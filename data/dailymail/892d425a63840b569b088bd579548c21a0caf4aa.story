An unemployed couple left three of their young children, all under four-years-old, home alone while they got married at a local courthouse.

Kymberely Frederick and Daniel Richards now face child neglect charges after they rushed to tie the knot so Richards could avoid paying child support.

Police were called to the house in Casselberry, Florida after a neighbour discovered that three of the couple’s five children were left alone in the family home, sleeping in their cribs.

Frederick, 30, and Richards, 34, had borrowed the neighbour’s car to get to the courthouse and later called and asked her to look out for their two older children, aged seven and eight, who would be walking home from the bus stop.

The neighbour asked about the three other children, aged one, two and four, only to be told they were asleep in their cribs.

She called police who arrested the pair as they arrived home.

All five children were taken into custody with Child Protective Services and are now in foster care.

In court on Wednesday it was revealed that the couple told neighbours that if they did not marry by September 10, Richards would have to pay child support but neither had a job and according to their landlord, were living rent free.

Richards seemed most concerned with getting a lawyer at the hearing.

He said to the judge: ‘When are they coming to see me?’

The judge replied: ‘If you don’t bond out, they’ll come see you when they find the time sir. It’s not like calling a taxi.’

Child neglect charges: Both unemployed, Frederick, pictured, and Richards now face child neglect charges and will have a custody hearing to determine whether they will get custody of their children restored

Another neighbour told WFTV.com that the couple often left their five children by themselves and it was only a matter of time until police were called.

Neighbour Sylvia Galvez said: ‘It's a sad story. Very sad the kids are very sweet.’

The couple will have a custody hearing to determine whether they will get custody of their children restored.

The case comes as a British two-year-old named Scarlet was left abandoned, crying in her buggy on a busy main road in Portuguese tourist town Carcavelos. Her parents were just 100 yards away ‘clearly very drunk’ according to police. Scarlet is now being looked after by social workers.

In America, parents are legally obliged to pay child support even if the couple never marries.
