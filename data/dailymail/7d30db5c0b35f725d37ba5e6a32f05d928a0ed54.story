A dedicated New York elementary school teacher can finally breathe easy after she got her students through some rigorous standardized tests - and herself a new pair of lungs.

Tricia Moses, 38, of Canarsie is suffering from scleroderma, an autoimmune disease that slowly turned her lungs into scar tissue and affects her skin, blood vessels, muscles and organs.

Doctors told Moses she needed a lung transplant - but she delayed the life-saving surgery to prepare her third graders with special needs for state exams.

'I couldn’t leave my students because I loved them so much,' Moses told the New York Daily News.

Moses, 38, is battling scleroderma - an autoimmune disease that was slowly stealing her ability to breathe.

She was diagnosed with the rare disease in 2011, when she noticed that she would get fatigued just writing on the chalkboard, and that her muscles and joints would ache.

A persistant cough that would come on in fits lasting up to seven minutes further confounded doctors.

Then, Moses suffered a miscarriage when she was three months pregnant.

'I coughed my child out. I knew my body couldn’t take it,' Moses told the Daily News. 'It was heartbreaking.'

She was told she needed a lung transplant in 2012, but the gutsy teacher continued to show up for class every day, toting an oxygen tanHer doctors don't know how she did it.

'I was just really surprised that she was still able to work,' Moses' rheumatologist Robyn Domsic told the Daily News. 'She was requiring a lot of oxygen at that point.'

Moses was scheduled for a lifesaving lung transplant last spring, but opted to put off the surgery until her students got through their exams in April 2013.

'She’s an amazing person. A pillar of strength, courage and humanity,' fifth-grade teacher Sandra Boyke told the Daily News. 'She puts others before herself.'

When Moses finally got her transplant on January 29 at Pittsburgh Medical Center, one of only two hospitals in the U.S. that performs the surgery, surgeons had to trim a set of lungs to fit her body because she couldn't afford to wait for a smaller pair.

As she recovered in Pittsburgh, Moses kept up with her students, talking to them on Facetime and Skype and receiving hand-drawn cards from children at Public School 233 in East Flatbush who miss her terribly.

Now, she's heading home to Brooklyn to see her beloved students after months of arduous recovery.

'I thank God I’m coming back,' Moses told the Daily News. 'I just want to get back to my students and family and raise awareness of my disease and the desperate need for donors.'

Moses still faces the risk of her body rejecting the lungs, so she's on huge amounts of medication to keep that risk at bay.

She won't be able to return to teaching a full class until next January, because there are too many germs and too much risk of illness for her, but she'll be tutoring smaller groups when she can.

'I miss her very much, her smile, the way she speaks, everything about her,' Jerell Johnson, 12, a former pupil who is now a fifth-grader at PS 233 told the Daily News. 'She gave people chances, even when we got on her nerves. I love her.'

Moses plans to return to Brooklyn on Wednesday and the first thing she wants to do it visit her class.
