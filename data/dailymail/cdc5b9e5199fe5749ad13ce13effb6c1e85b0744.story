British war veteran Ronnie Jessiman (above) died in a Taliban suicide bomb attack while working as a security guard for a diplomatic convoy in Kabul

A British security guard who died yesterday in a suicide bomb attack on a diplomatic convoy in Afghanistan was today named as a married war veteran.

Former Scottish soldier Ronnie Jessiman was among five killed when the Taliban targeted a UK embassy vehicle in the capital Kabul.

Another Briton was among dozens wounded as the bomber pulled up in a car next to the official four-wheel drive vehicle and detonated his device.

Mr Jessiman, who once served with 5 Scots, the Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders, was believed to be working for private security firm G4S as a bodyguard.

The former Bellahouston Academy pupil had previously enjoyed a successful career in the army, where he was a section commander in 5 SCOTS Fire Support Group.

An Army source told the Daily Record: 'Ronnie was an experienced soldier and really knew his stuff.

'It's just a tragedy. After he left the army, he worked in close protection - his role at the time he died.

'It just shows you that no matter how good your skills and drills are, sometimes your luck just runs out.'

The force of the blast blew the embassy vehicle on to its side on a busy road close to Kabul's diplomatic area.

Many other vehicles were torn apart in the explosion.

A translator working for Britain was among four Afghans killed. More than 30 were wounded, including at least four children.

Witnesses described the scene as a mass of mangled vehicles and bodies.

Foreign Secretary Philip Hammond condemned the attack, believed to have been timed ahead of an international summit in London next week on Afghanistan's future following the Nato-led combat mission.

Taliban insurgents claimed responsibility for the bomb and later attacked a district of Kabul which contains many embassies. 

It is understood that three of the victims in the first blast include members of a family who were heading to nearby Jalalabad for a wedding. 

A sixth body recovered from the scene is believed to belong to the suicide bomber himself, who was travelling in a red Toyota Corolla car packed with explosives.

The explosion left 33 other people injured - many of them civilians who had been going about their business along the busy stretch of road running from Kabul to the city of Jalalabad, which lies 95 miles to the east of the Afghan capital.

Taliban insurgents later released a brief statement claiming responsibility for the attack, saying the group had 'targeted foreign invading forces'. 

A second massive blast followed by exchanges of gunfire rocked Kabul's central Wazir Akbar Khan district, which houses a large number of embassies and foreign compounds.

The dead British national, whose name has not yet been released, has been confirmed as an expatriate employee of private security firm G4S. 

A G4S spokesman said in a statement: 'At 10:20am local time this morning in Kabul, a suicide-vehicle-borne improvised explosive device was detonated targeting a British Embassy vehicle moving through the city.'

'A local member of the Embassy staff and an expatriate G4S security team member were both killed in the explosion. 

'A second British member of the G4S security team was injured. An investigation into the incident is underway and therefore we are unable to comment further at this time'.

'Next of kin have been informed and we will continue to provide them with support. Our thoughts and most heartfelt condolences are with the families, friends and colleagues of those involved in this tragic incident.' 

Afghan Public Health Ministry spokesman Kanishka Bektash Turkistani that at least four children were among the 33 people injured by the massive suicide bomb blast, which he described as 'an inhuman act by the enemies of peace and stability in Afghanistan.'

Eyewitness Mustafa Deveci told MailOnline: 'The explosion happened at around 10am. I saw five or six civilian cars blown up on the road, I couldn't tell which ones belonged to the British embassy.'

'I saw the damage of the smoking cars. The explosion happened on a very busy road.It's the main road going from Kabul to Jalalabad. It's always full of people.'

'All the seriously injured people had already been taken to hospital when I got there, but I saw a guy sitting at the roadside with minor injuries. A woman ran up to him and asked if her relatives were all right, he told her they'd been killed. She just broke down and started crying and cursing.'

'She was pointing at the car in the picture I tweeted. The rest of her relatives were travelling in it. I heard they were going to a wedding in Jalalabad.'

In a statement released yesternoon afternoon, Mr Hammond said: 'I am deeply saddened to confirm that a British national civilian security team member and an Afghan national working for the Embassy were killed in the incident.

'I condemn this appalling attack on innocent civilians supporting our diplomatic activity. The families of the victims have been informed and my thoughts are with them. The Foreign Office will do everything it can to support them.

'This outrage brings home to us once again the courage and perseverance of the people of Afghanistan and members of the international community who support them, who have lived together through decades of conflict.

'We will not allow such inhumanity to deter us from continuing our partnership with the Government of Afghanistan. 

'I have nothing but admiration for the staff of the Embassy, British and Afghan, who work at great personal risk to help build a better future for Afghanistan.

The attack took place in the east of the city, shaking parts of Kabul and sending a huge plume of dust and smoke into the air.

The interior ministry initially reported the blast was caused by a suicide bomber on a motorcycle, but later said attacker was travelling by car. 

The Taliban subsequently claimed responsibility for the attack in a brief statement, saying it had deliberately 'targeted foreign invading forces'.

The area of the blast in eastern Kabul has many foreign compounds and international military installations. The particular stretch or road through which the car was driving is considered one of the most dangerous in the world, with four suicide bomb attacks there in the last two weeks alone.

It is the latest in a wave of attacks to hit Kabul as the majority of foreign combat troops withdraw from Afghanistan by the end of the year.

In recent weeks, insurgents have launched attacks on military convoys and compounds housing foreign service companies and their international employees.

Prime Minister David Cameron yesterday condemned the attack, adding that it would be up to the Foreign Office to decide whether to heighten security at the British embassy.

In recent weeks, insurgents have launched attacks on military convoys in the area and on compounds housing foreign service companies and their international employees.

Kabul has come under almost daily attack as insurgents intensify their war on local security forces and U.S. and NATO troops, who are set to officially conclude their combat role in the country at the end of next month. 

On Tuesday two explosions shook the Afghan capital, leaving seven army officers wounded. 

A remote-controlled bomb exploded in Kabul's outskirts as a bus carrying Afghan army personnel passed by, said Zahir Azimi, a spokesman for the Afghan defence ministry.

A later blast shook houses in the Wazir Akbar Khan area of the city, which is home to embassies, international media offices and aid groups, but there were no casualties, police said.

A day earlier, a magnetic bomb killed two U.S. troops in the Afghan capital. 

British embassies and staff have been targeted in trouble-spots around the world in recent years, with Kabul among them.

In August 2008 a car bomb attack near the embassy in the Afghan capital left four people dead, although none were British personnel.

In November 2011 the embassy in the Iranian capital Tehran was closed after it was stormed by a mob of protesters.

In April 2010 the then British ambassador to Yemen, Tim Torlet, escaped unharmed when a suicide bomber wearing a school uniform detonated an explosives belt as he made his way to work in the capital Sana'a. 

The following October, his deputy, Fionna Gibb, escaped a rocket attack in the city.  

Last year the embassy in the Arab country was closed by the Foreign Office during the Islamic festival Eid, amid 'continuing security concerns'.

On November 2003 the British Consul-General in Turkey, Roger Short, was killed by a suicide car bomb in Istanbul blamed on al Qaida which left 60 others dead and hundreds injured.

This morning Franz-Michael Skjold Mellbin, the European Union's special representative in Kabul, wrote on Twitter: 'Strongly condemn this morning's indiscriminate attack in Kabul that left many Afghans dead and injured UK colleagues.'
