One of the Colombian escorts embattled in the Secret Service scandal in Cartagena broke her silence today and spilled some sordid details of the night several of President Obama’s men became embroiled with scandal.

Dania Suarez, 24, spoke in an exclusive interview to W Radio in Colombia, and told listeners in Spanish that one of the agents, identified as Arthur Huntington, was ‘heavily intoxicated.’

Huntington has since left the Secret Service.

Prostitute Dania Suarez spoke out onW Radio and Caracol TV, in Madrid, Spain on Friday, her first public interview

Secret Service agents paid nine women after they took them back to their Colombian hotel rooms, including Dania, who was almost denied her fee entirely

The young single mother appeared in the studio looking tan, with her long, dark hair tumbling down her back. While she denies being a ‘prostitute,’ she said she requested ‘a little present’ of $800.

She said that the luggage and documents in the suitcase in his hotel room were left out in the open, and could easily have been taken, if she were a spy, according to ABC News.

Suarez also said she never would have complained about not being paid had she known the agent was part of Mr Obama’s security detail.

She said she fled the country after the scandal broke for fear of retribution, and spent time in Dubai with a person she had met in Cartagena.

She said in the interview that she will gladly sell her story and has contracted one of Colombia’s top lawyers, according to the interview.

When asked whether or not she and Huntington had sex, she responded: ‘If I answer this, you will know what happened.’

However, she said that Huntington 
‘did not feel he got what he was being asked to pay for,’ which led to 
the now-infamous feud and the scandal breaking out.

Suarez said she considers herself an escort, because prostitutes ‘are lower class and live in brothels.’

A government report published earlier this week tells how the 
Secret Service agents involved in the Colombian prostitution scandal 
paid nine of the 12 women that they took home from the bar on that wild 
evening.

Hotel: The agent allegedly took the prostitute to his room in Cartagena's Hotel Caribe

The Secret Service submitted a 
detailed report about what exactly happened on the night that a dozen 
agents were partying at a bar in Cartagena while in the country to 
protect the President.

The report confirms that nine of the 
women who went back to the Hotel Caribe with the agents were paid 
thought their identities were not publicly revealed.

The Washington Post says that the 
24-page report was submitted to the relevant congressional committees 
who are investigating the scandal, and those officials will not release 
the full extent of their findings.

Investigators from the Secret Service 
are continuing their hunt for more information about the evening, and so
far they have only spoken with those nine women. They are still looking
to talk to the remaining three women.

So far, they have done background 
checks on the first nine and have reported that none of them have 
connections to terrorist organizations or drug cartels, which was a 
major concern at the beginning of the scandal since they had access to 
the Secret Service agent's hotel rooms.

The women were aged between 20 and 39 years old.

Taking care of business: Suarez said that she is now willing to sell her story

'We’re going to use this as a base to 
operate from, but we’re also waiting for those statements from the 
women,' Congressman Peter King told The Washington Post.

Mr King, one of those in charge of the
congressional investigations, said that speaking to the remaining three
women 'will fill in a lot of the gaps'.

The
embarrassing prostitution scandal has resulted in the Secret Service 
sending about 100 of its agents on an ethics training course.

The agents will take part in two days of training this week from professors at Johns Hopkins University near Washington.

The Secret Service has originally scheduled training for just 20 agents.

But following the scandal, it expanded the course to include about 100.

The university has previously worked with the Secret Service and so was deemed a good choice.

Some of the new guidelines include:

The report also details the staff ranks of some of the dozen agents involved with the women in Cartagena, Colombia.

Two were supervisory criminal investigators, three were snipers, three were part of a counterassault team.

Nine of the 12 agents submitted to polygraph exams, while three chose not to cooperate.

One of the three that did not submit 
to a test was the man who initially caused the whole fiasco by refusing 
to pay his prostitute in full.

That man, identified as Arthur Huntington, would not pay the $800 he initially agreed to pay prostitute Diana Suarez.

Huntington's wife, Jolie, told 
relatives she will ‘make the marriage work’ with Arthur Huntington, her 
husband of nearly 20 years.

Friends and family of the couple say that he would never have intentionally hurt her.

Huntington has left the agency since 
the incident earlier this month, but the circumstances of his departure 
are unclear. His home in Severna Park, Maryland reportedly went on sale 
last week.

Ms Suarez has previously told her side
of the story, saying she met Huntington and the other men in a local 
bar and agreed to go back to their hotel.

In the morning the hotel forced her to leave, but Huntington refused to hand over the $800 she believed she was owed.

Police were called, setting off a 
Secret Service investigation which involved 12 agents and another 12 
members of the military and which overshadowed Barack Obama's visit to 
the Summit of the Americas.

Protectee: The scandal eclipsed the point of the
summit; President Obama has made jokes at the Secret Service's expense 
at last week's White House Correspondents' Dinner

Father: Huntington, who has now left the Secret Service, is said to be married with two children

The revelation came as the Secret 
Service circulated 'enhanced standards of conduct' from director Mark 
Sullivan in response to the prostitution scandal in Colombia.

The document instructed employees to 'consider your conduct through the lens of the past several weeks.'

Highlights of the guidelines included standards of conduct briefings for all protective visits and events.
