Manchester United and Chelsea on alert as target Cavani's agents hold talks in London

Liverpool, Manchester City, United, Arsenal and Chelsea are watching with interest as a contract wrangle unfolds over highly-rated Hamburg centre back Jonathan Tah.

The Germany U17 captain turns 18 next Tuesday but signed a lucrative contract extension in November that is being challenged by his father and FIFA.

Fifa rules dictate that players under 18 can only be tied down for a maximum of three years and any deal running for longer will not be recognised by the governing body.

His father Aquilas, who has been divorced from Jonathan's mother for three years, said: 'The contract is only in the interest of the HSV and the consultant and not in the interest of my son. I should never have him signed with them. I will go to court.

'According to FIFA rules, the contract is invalid because it is more than three years. This is not allowed for a minor. I will make sure that Adewunmi has nothing to do with my son.'

His representative Akeem Adewunmi counters: 'The parents have signed, the boy has signed. Thus, the contract is valid. All this has its accuracy. Jonathan wants to stay until 2018 at HSV. Here people want to challenge something but there is nothing to challenge.'

United and Arsenal have been following Tah since he was 15 and were hoping to bring him to England until Hamburg persuaded the boy to sign a three year contract on January 23, 2013.

However, Hamburg then extended his deal by a further two years on November 27, 2013, which is now being challenged.

Tah, who has played 15 first team games this season, signed a deal that has a release clause set at £20.7million and earns him £2,490 a point this season on top of his basic salary for the first year.

His basic increases each year with bonuses rising to £6,642 a point in his final year as well as increments in his salary and bonuses should he be capped a full international level.

Manchester City have been linked with a £6m bid in recent weeks although Adewunmi said it was without foundation.

Tied down? Tah's scout Sebastian Arnesen insists his future will be in Hamburg

Reports in Germany added to the intrigue, stating that City had been alerted to a possible deal by scout Sebastian Arnesen, who is the son of Frank who was the sporting director at Hamburg last year that tied Tah down to his initial contract.

When he signed a contract last year Frank Arnesen hailed him claiming: 'He is the greatest defensive talent Hamburg has had. Jonathan is extremely strong, very fast, strong in the tackle and technically adept physically for his age. He has everything it takes to be a good defender. All the first division clubs in Spain, Germany and England want him but Tah's future lies in Hamburg.'

It seems that could be put to the test in the coming months.

City looking for low-cost Fares - and youngsters will get New York chance

Manchester City scouts were in the crowd at the Viareggo Cup youth tournament in Italy this week with Hellas Verona midfielder Mohamed Fares reputedly the main object of their attention. The 17-year-old Fares, a French midfielder with Algerian roots impressed against Lazio with Liverpool also having representatives in the stands.

Meanwhile, City's youngsters will have the opportunity to play for New York City FC once the MLS franchise is up and running. The American side will be allowed to loan four players from their parent club in England and head coach Jason Kreis has been over to study potential signings for the 2015 season.

The 41-year-old, who was appointed in January, told City's official website: 'We will have the ability to take four players on loan from the club here. So I'm looking a lot at the younger players and the U18s and the U21s at the moment and also the players that are out on loan. We'll have to get with those guys over the next six months to a year and see whether or not that's something they would like as well.'

United show persistence in chase of Arsenal youngster Willock

Manchester United are continuing their pursuit of Arsenal prodigy Chris Willock. The 16-year-old has been training with the Arsenal first team and is contracted until July but has yet to sign up as a scholar.

That means United could still sign him potentially for £300,000 compensation if the scholar forms remain unsigned. MailOnline revealed how Willock's elder brother Matty is already at United and they hope that can help persuade Chris to make the move north.

English elite chase Marseille's Lopez

Marseille midfielder Maxime Lopez is proving another draw for English scouts. Chelsea, Arsenal, City and Liverpool have again been among the clubs listed as visiting the Stade Velodrome on a frequent basis to study the 16-year-old. He has been playing in Marseille's Under-17 side but also appeared in this season's UEFA Youth League competition.

He featured in all six of the French side's group games, playing against Arsenal, Borussia Dortmund and Napoli. Marseille believe he has already been offered deals to move to England with wages of up to £17,000 a month discussed.

Robben set to extend contract until 2017

Arjen Robben is expected to sign a new contract at Bayern Munich this month as talks begin with his representatives and the club. The Dutchman's current deal expires in 2015, but is largely expected to agree a renewal until 2017.

Boro deal for Mladenovic falls through

Middlesbrough's hopes of signing left-back Filip Mladenovic fell through yesterday as they failed to agree personal terms.

The Serbia international, who had also attracted interest from Reading, had left Red Star Belgrade and was a free agent after they failed to pay his wages. The 22-year-old held talks at Boro and was wanted by Aitor Karanka but terms could not be agreed and he has flown to Poland to discuss terms with Legia Gdansk who offered better salary package.

Gregory may get Football League chance after all

Lee Gregory may have failed to realise his dream of a football league transfer move on deadline day but it may yet happen for the Halifax Town striker.

Electrician Gregory, 25, took a day off work last Friday in the hope of securing a transfer from Conference side Halifax to Championship Blackburn. However, the deal didn't come to fruition as Blackburn manager Gary Bowyer weighed up other options.

After further talks with the Halifax chairman though, they will consider loan deals with a view to a permanent deal as now Doncaster, Burnley and Bolton pick up interest.

Gregory has 21 goals in 25 games this season including a hat-trick against Salisbury on Tuesday night.

Bits and pieces

Norwich City winger Jacob Murphy is looking to join Swindon Town on loan. The 18-year-old made his senior debut in the FA Cup draw with Fulham last month.

Troubled Leeds are ready to send Paul Green to Ipswich on loan next week once the new owners give clearance on the financial breakdown of the deal with Ipswich picking up a percentage of his wages.

League Two strugglers Bristol Rovers have signed striker Steven Gillespie on a deal until the end of the season. The 28-year-old, who was released by Fleetwood Town at the end of January, will help replace Ryan Brunt who suffered a season-ending knee injury.
