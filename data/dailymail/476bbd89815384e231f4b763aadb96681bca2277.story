It was an incredible sight that was witnessed by about 130 whale watchers, who had been spending their Sunday afternoon cruising on Sydney Harbour.

A 40 tonne humpback whale put on a spectacular aerial display as it breached 2km off the entrance of Sydney Harbour at about 3.30pm.

Stunning images of the magnificently mammoth sea creature were captured by cruise director of Whale Watching Sydney Jonas Liebschner, who was ready for the money shot.

'It only jumped once so I was very lucky to see that,' he said.

'And it was a perfect way to finish off the day as the tour was coming to an end.'

Mr Liebschner says the whales are migration north to warmer waters for mating season.

'It's near the end of the migration season but they'll be coming back in a few months time,' he said,

Mr Liebschner says there have been about 20,000 whales migrating past Sydney this year with an annual increase of about 10 per cent.

'I've been doing this job for seven years now and it gets easier every year because we're seeing more and more of them,' he said.

When they return back for the southern migration, Mr Liebschner says there will be about 2000 calves swimming with their mothers through Sydney Harbour around October and November.
