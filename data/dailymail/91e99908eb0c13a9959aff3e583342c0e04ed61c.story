Jose Mourinho called it 'fantastic news' after Wembley was named as the host stadium for the climax to Euro 2020.

The Chelsea manager indicated he has no plans to leave the club game by then to take up a national team job.

But, as a supporter, the Portuguese believes England's national stadium will be an ideal venue for the semi-finals and final of the European Championship in six years' time.

Jose Mourinho said he was delighted Wembley will host the final and semis of Euro 2020

Greg Dyke, chairman of the FA, celebrates the announcement in Geneva on Friday 

Asked about the Football Association's successful bid to stage the three crunch games, Mourinho said: 'Great. I think it has to be a special Euro because it is playing in so many countries, but ending in London and Wembley, I think is fantastic news.

'I'd like to be there as a fan, not as a manager.'

The tournament will be played across 13 European cities: London, Baku, Brussels, Copenhagen, Munich, Budapest, Rome, Amsterdam, Dublin, Bucharest, St Petersburg, Glasgow and Bilbao.

The new Wembley, which opened in 2007, hosted the Champions League finals in 2011 and 2013

Former England striker Gary Lineker warmly welcomed news of Wembley's success, and hopes it can spur the national team.

Lineker was a star for England in two World Cups but could not transfer that form to the European Championship stage, and bowed out of international football after a painful Euro 92 experience.

He is keen to see England, who hosted Euro 96 and reached the semi-finals, put in another strong performance and still be battling for the trophy come the point the tournament reaches Wembley.

The Chelsea manager said he hopes to be at the Wembley matches, but as a fan not as a manager

Lineker wrote on Twitter: 'Terrific news that Wembley will host the semis and final of Euro 2020! Hope we're in it at that stage, and that I'm still alive to enjoy it.'

In an aside, and making reference to Glasgow's trend-bucking verdict in the Scottish referendum, Lineker added: 'Good to see too that Glasgow got another yes vote, and will host a last 16 game.'

London Mayor Boris Johnson pointed to the city's Olympic Games success as he added on Twitter: 'Great news that Wembley Stadium will host both semi-finals and the final of Euro 2020, continuing the lasting legacy of 2012'.

Boris Johnson said Wembley hosting the final and semis would continue the legacy of London 2012

While Scotland had other issues to debate, after the country's overall referendum 'No' vote, there was delight in Ireland at Dublin being handed three group games and one last-16 fixture.

Former Republic of Ireland winger Stephen Hunt said: 'Fair play to @FAIreland for getting four games during the euros 2020! I know irish people will buy into it and the buzz that goes with it.

'It's not just the 2020 tournament. Ireland will get to show people what we are capable of, maybe one day hosting one ourselves is now on'.
