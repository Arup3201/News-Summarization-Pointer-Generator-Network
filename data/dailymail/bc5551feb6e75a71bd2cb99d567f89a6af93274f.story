A couple who made history as the first to 
undergo in vitro fertilization (IVF) on live television eight weeks ago,
were filmed this week as they returned to hospital to hear their baby's
heart beating.

Jessica 
Menkhausen and Derek Manion from St Peters, Missouri, were caught on 
camera by the Today show as they waited for an ultrasound to confirm news of a healthy pregnancy.

'Well that's the heart right there,' a doctor explained during a clip of the event aired this morning, 'and as I scan through I'm seeing . . . one sac with a really good heartbeat.'

Overwhelmed: Jessica Menkhausen and Derek Manion, who made history as the first to undergo IVF on live TV eight weeks ago, were filmed this week as they returned to hospital to hear their baby's heart beating

'I can't say that I'm disappointed,' Ms Menkhausen, 33, responded holding back tears.

She had expressed a desire for twins originally but exclaimed when she saw the scan: 'I'm happy that there's just one.'

Writing about the event afterwards she continued: 'We got to see our baby’s glorious heart beating!

'Being able to actually see our little bundle of joy was an indescribably wonderful feeling.'

She said friends and family have jokingly tried to console her 
by reminding her one baby means 'half the diaper expense, half the clothes
expense, and half the formula expense.'

The ultrasound was performed by Dr. Sherman Silber, director of the Infertility Center of St. Louis, who has been with the couple every step of the way through their IVF experience.

Now that he has confirmed the pregnancy his part is complete and Miss Menkhausen and Mr Manion's next step is to make an appointment with an obstetrics and gynecology doctor.

'Being able to actually see our little bundle of joy was an indescribably wonderful feeling'

The expectant mother said in her first trimester she has been feeling 'extremely tired, more exhausted than I’ve ever felt.'

'For almost eight years now I have been used to a hectic 60-hour work week schedule, whether it was working full-time and going to school at night, or working full-time during the day and teaching part-time at night.

'I used to hate taking naps because I felt like I was wasting time, but now I look forward to my three to four naps every Saturday and Sunday.'

She says that her appetite has also increased and if she doesn't eat every few hours she gets headaches.

IVF process: The 33-year-old is seen in the operating theater as 'good embryos' are transferred into her uterus

Road to motherhood: Dr Sherman Silber shows exactly where he placed the embryos

'I am sure I have gained weight, namely because all my clothes are fitting very snugly,' she added, explaining that she plans to go shopping for maternity wear soon.

Ms Menkhausen previously said that she is 'ecstatic' about the prospect of motherhood, after years of struggling to conceive.

The Today show started following her on September 24 when eggs were harvested from her ovaries by ultrasound guidance at St. Luke's Hospital, Missouri.

'I know that the next three months are a 
very critical time period for the pregnancy, so no more fast food for 
me'

NBC's
Dr. Nancy Snyderman said from inside the operating room: 'Right now Dr 
Sherman Silber is inserting a micro needle with a little suction into 
the ovary and each of these black sacks you see really houses an egg. 
They're being sucked out and being examined behind us.'

Viewers were then told how Ms Menkhausen's eggs would be 
transported to the laboratory where her fiance's sperm would be 
injected into them to start the fertilization process.

Three days later, three 'good embryos' were transferred back into Ms Menkhausen's uterus.

Pre-surgery, Ms Menkhausen said that 
she wanted to share her journey through fertility treatment to 
'enlighten other women who are having the same challenges.'

Success: Dr Silber holds an image of the embryos he created

'It’s also a form of 
self-enlightenment - sharing my story is helping me deal with some of my
own fears, by courageously facing them head on.'

She
had battled fertility issues since a teenager. Every month she would 
experience 'excruciating' menstrual cramps and went on to suffer
two ectopic pregnancies in her twenties.

'It took years to get over,' she said. 'I was really glad when we met Dr Silber, he gave us so much hope.'

'Despite
the roller coaster, I know that the first time I 
hear our baby cry, it will be well worth what we have gone through'

To
pay for the procedure, which can cost up to $17,000 per cycle, she and 
Mr Manion have been forced to put their wedding on hold until next year.

Before getting her eggs harvested Ms Menkhausen went through four weeks of pretreatment at St Luke's Hospital.

This
saw her be injected with drugs to suppress her natural hormonal cycle and 
take daily hits of FSH (Follicle Stimulating Hormone) to stimulate 
the production of eggs.

Throughout the drug treatment, her progress was monitored via ultrasound scans and blood tests.

The
Missouri-based couple said they were determined for their IVF to work 
first time around, as they used their savings to pay for the procedure 
and cannot afford another cycle.

High hopes: Ms Menkhausen originally said she thought she was going to have twins and with red hair

Maintaining a positive attitude 
throughout, Ms Menkhausen, who works as an accountant, said before 
learning she was pregnant: 'I want to be positive and I think we're 
going to have twins and they're going to have red hair and blue eyes. 
That's what we have to keep thinking.'

'Despite
the hormone roller coaster, bruising from injections, and the constant 
"what-if" analysis going on in my head, I know that the first time I 
hear our baby cry, it will be well worth what we have gone through.'

Parents-to-be: Ms Menkhausen and Mr Manion's next step is to make an appointment with an obstetrics and gynecology doctor

She and Mr Manion, received a telephone call from Dr Silber in October telling them their IVF had worked.

Ms
Menkhausen said that she hopes to show her children the televised 
recording of her IVF treatment one day, to show them how much we wanted 
them.'

She added: 'I know that the next three months are a 
very critical time period for the pregnancy, so no more fast food for 
me.

'Ultimately were 
are praying for a safe pregnancy and healthy babies . . . This whole 
process has been an amazing journey for both of us.'
