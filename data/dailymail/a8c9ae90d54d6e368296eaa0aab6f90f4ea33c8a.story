A woman is set to scale one of the world's highest mountains for a second time after she forgot her first climb because of altitude-related amnesia.

Doreen Cree first reached the top of Mount Kilimanjaro in 2012 but suffered altitude sickness during the entire expedition.

The 53-year-old reached the summit of Africa's highest peak but had to be escorted down by a doctor and the illness caused her memory to black out.

Doreen Cree (pictured) reached the summit of Africa's highest peak but had to be escorted down by a doctor and the illness caused her memory to black out

It left the office worker with a five-hour gap in her memory including the moment - she was later told by fellow climbers - she watched the sunrise from the almost 20,000ft-high peak.

She has a series of photographs of her taken at the top but cannot remember ever being on the climb - where she raised money for Alzheimer's Disease.

But she is now determined to get the memories back - by climbing the mountain a second time.

Ms Cree - known as Dee - of Hillingdon, west London, said: 'I was suffering quite badly with altitude sickness during the climb.

'My face swelled up and I looked almost unrecognisable. The last thing I can remember is five or six hours after the summit when we were climbing down.

'The doctor said I'd get my memories of that particular six hours back, but they never came. And now I've got to do it all over again.'

During the first climb Ms Cree and her group of sixteen others camped only a couple of hours away from the peak and raised around £65,000 for The Alzheimer's Society.

She cannot remember the last remaining stretch of the climb but can just about recall being at Stella Point - 200m from the top.

Ms Cree has now jumped at the chance to be part of a 35-strong team attempting to climb the mountain in January, once again for The Alzheimer's Society.

She said: 'I suppose it's a bit ironic that I'm climbing to raise money for Alzheimer's but I cannot remember doing it.

'I love doing things for charity, and I wanted to raise money after the sudden death of my mum at Christmas in 2010.

'I never got to say goodbye, so I wanted to go somewhere high enough to say goodbye to her properly.

'I must have done that when I got to the top, but since I can't remember, I want to do it all over again.'

Best friend Sue Cree, 62, hopes her friend will be able to remember the experience this time around.

She said: 'Dee is the strongest person I know, we're like sisters. On the first day her knee went, but she strapped it up and carried on. That's the type of woman she is.

'And to do all that and go all that way to not remember the final bit, the thing that kept her going up the mountain, is just too cruel.

'That's why she's doing it again. I've got nothing but admiration for her.'

Memory loss is a common symptom of acute mountain sickness, caused by the body struggling to cope with a lack of oxygen at high altitude.

The potentially fatal syndrome can occur at altitudes above 5000ft. Climbers usually spend time adjusting to the high altitude at a specialist camp to prevent the condition.
