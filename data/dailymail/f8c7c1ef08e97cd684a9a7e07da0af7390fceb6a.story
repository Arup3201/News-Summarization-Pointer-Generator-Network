To all of his Instagram followers Keisuki Jinushi has the perfect girlfriend who loves to shower him with kisses.

But not everything is as it seems.

Because Jinushi doesn't actually have a girlfriend.

Pucker up: Keisuki Jinushi appears to have the perfect girlfriend judging by these photos

The 28-year-old, from Tokyo, was fed-up of seeing couples being affectionate in public so decided to start a blog teaching other singletons how to take photographs with imaginary girlfriends. 

His recent collection captures the photographer and writer taking a selfie while holding a wig which looks like the back of a woman's head.

The images can really fool his followers into thinking he has a girlfriend. 

He calls the practice the 'hitori date' or 'one-man date.'

It's not the first time his pictures have become an internet hit.

The photographer from Tokyo used make-up on his right hand and paints his nails shocking pink to make the hand look like his 'girlfriend's'.

He has posted a step-by-step picture tutorial on Instagram showing his followers how they too can create the girlfriend effect.

All you need to turn your hand into a lover's is some thick foundation, nail polish and a girly hair-tie to wear around your wrist.

Other than that, the ingenious snapper advises taking your "selfies" from strategic angles and using a retro-style filter to create a convincing effect.

Several of the pictures seem to show Jinushi's girlfriend 'feeding' him - an act he describes as 'the symbol of happiness' on his Daily Portal Z blog.

In others, 'she' strokes and squeezes his face.

Jinushi believes that having an actual lover is not necessary in today's virtual world to make people on the social-sharing site think you are in a loving relationship, according to Designtaxi.com.

As far as the 'boyfriend' is concerned, Jinushi says, the secret is in the 'shy smile'.

On his blog, he says he wants people to feel happy when they look at what seem to be pictures of a happy couple.
