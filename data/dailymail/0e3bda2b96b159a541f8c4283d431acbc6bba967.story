Expanding her portfolio: Suze Orman reportedly plans to leave CNBC after 14 years next March 

America's most visible personal finance guru Suze Orman is looking to exapnd her portfolio.

Wildly successful television show host and author Suze Orman, 63, plans to trade in her show at CNBC for a new daily series after 14 years.

Orman's is the longest-running show in the network's history. She'll give her final goodbye to CNBC next March.

Sometime not long after that, sources told The Wrap the money whiz will take her talents to Warner Bros. Telepictures, who will produce her new daily series.

Dubbed Suze Orman's Money Wars, the show will reportedly have Orman helping families, couples and friends who are fighting over money issues sort out their differences.

Her current show, which started back in 2002, regularly reaches 3 million viewers per week.

Her departure will no doubt be a blow to the network, but does not appear to be at all acrimonious.

At least not according to CNBC President Mark Hoffman, who wrote in an internal memo obtained by The Wrap:

'Her motto “People first, then money, then things” resonates not only through our hallways but through the universe.

'I want to personally thank Suze for her friendship and for her incredible contributions to CNBC.

'Please join me in wishing Suze the very best in the future.'

In addition to her success on TV, Orman has spent years making it to the new York Times bestsellers list with her financial self-help books.

Orman has written nine such books that made it to the list. PBS has turned eight of them into TV specials.

Suze Orman's Money Wars will likely premier sometime in fall 2015.
