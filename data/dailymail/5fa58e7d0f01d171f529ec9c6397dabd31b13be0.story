Millions of mobile phone users could be at risk of having their private details shared after SIM cards provided to Telstra, Optus and Vodafone had their encryption keys stolen.

The SIM cards were provided to the telco companies by Dutch digital security company Gemalto, who announced a few days ago they believe they had been hacked, according to a statement on their website.

US and British spy agencies are said to have hacked into the chips and secured the encryption keys, giving them access to person information, texts and phone calls.

This could means millions of SIM cards provided to the company may need to be recalled, as this is the only way to deal with the stolen encryption keys. 

Optus and Telstra both confirmed to Daily Mail Australia that Gemalto was one of the vendors they source SIM cards from.

The revelations come after Dutch digital security company Gemalto, who provide SIM cards to the companies, was apparently hacked by spy agencies

'Optus uses a number of SIM vendors including Gemalto,' a spokesperson said.

'We are aware of the security allegation and are awaiting advice from Gemalto.'

Telstra said they take their 'customers privacy and security very seriously', and revealed they too are working with the digital security company to decide their next move.

'Telstra sources SIM cards from multiple suppliers, including Gemalto, the world's biggest manufacturer of SIM cards', a spokesperson from Telstra confirmed.

'We're in contact with Gemalto and they are investigating the claims. We will work with Gemalto to address any issues they might identify.

'SIM card encryption is just one of multiple ways Telstra secures our network and the communications of our customers,' they also said.

Gemalto is said to produce at least two billion SIM cards worldwide each year and their company motto boasts 'security to be free'

Vodafone confirmed to Fairfax they too had  been affected, but none of the telco giants would divulge details on whether they would provide replacement SIMs to their customers.

According to The Intercept, international companies such as AT&T, T-Mobile, Verizon and Sprint have also been impacted by the event.

On Friday the online publication revealed claims that the hack was carried out by a joint unit of operatives from the NSA and its British counterpart Government Communications Headquarters (GCHQ).

This stealing of the encryption keys would allow the agencies to monitor phone calls, text messages and other operations, all without being detected.

'It enables them to bypass wiretapping restrictions, it doesn't require any special tool, you don't have to be very sophisticated to go through this decryption,' Linus Information Security Solutions director Mike Thompson told Fairfax.
