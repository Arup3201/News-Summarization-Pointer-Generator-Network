Plumbers doing maintenance work accidentally started the fire which ripped through a 400-unit luxury New Jersey apartment complex and left more than 1,000 people homeless, officials have claimed.

The blaze at The Avalon at Edgewater, a complex overlooking the Hudson River and across from New York City, was under control but still smoldering Thursday, more than a day after it began on the first floor.

At a news conference with Governor Chris Christie, Edgewater Police Chief William Skidmore said plumbers inadvertently started the fire inside a wall. He called the cause of the fire 'totally accidental.'

'A plumbing repair ignited a fire in the wall which then spread through the building,' he said. 'It was accidental, there was nothing suspicious about it, and we have complete verification and there's no doubt about it. It was just a tragic accident.' 

Authorities said everyone in the four-story building—where a two-bedroom with views of Manhattan would set you back around $3,000 per month—was able to flee to safety. The fire gutted 240 of the 408 units.

Homeless: Over 1,000 residents are now effectively homeless following the blaze, which broke out in the city with sweeping Manhattan views around 4;30opm Wednesday

Gutted: Firefighters continued to douse the smoldering ashes as the sun rose early Thursday morning. The fire gutted 240 of the 408 units

Desperate: Everyone escaped to safety from the 400-unit building but now many residents must scramble to find new homes

State of emergency: Edgewater Mayor Michael McPartland declared a local state of emergency. He said schools would be closed on Thursday and access to roads would be restricted until further notice.

Fire Chief Thomas Jacobson described how the building's sprinklers were working, but the lightweight, wooden structure fuelled the flames and made fighting the fire difficult

Two civilians and two firefighters sustained minor injuries. Christie called the job done by first responders 'extraordinary' and called the lack of fatalities 'an enormous blessing.'

Before speaking, Christie met with town officials, including the mayor and fire and police chiefs in the auditorium of the Edgewater Community Center, where the Red Cross and others had set up tables where displaced residents could get help finding apartments, medicine and other services.

'We'll be here to help,' Christie told one woman as he took a tour shortly after. 'I'm sorry for your loss.'

A GoFundMe page has not been set up for the residents who have been displaced by the fire. 

Mayor Michael McPartland said he watched as firefighters pulled three people out of the burning structure, then saw others go back in and rescue a woman 'while the facade was coming down virtually on top of them.'

Fire Chief Thomas Jacobson described how the building's sprinklers were working, but the lightweight, wooden structure fueled the flames and made fighting the fire difficult.

'It's very difficult because once it's in the walls and floors, we're chasing it,' Jacobson said. 

Engulfed in flames: A fire broke out at an Edgewater, New Jersey, apartment complex Wednesday night, sending flames sky high and creating smoke visible across the Hudson River in Manhattan

The building complied with construction and fire codes, the fire chief said, but he added: 'If it was made out of cinder block and concrete, we wouldn't have this problem.'

Hampered by winds and frigid temperatures, firefighters battled the huge fire Wednesday night at the Avalon apartment complex, home to New York Yankees announcer John Sterling and a thousand others.

The enormous fire sent flames sky high and left smoke still visible from Manhattan in the early hours of Thursday. Residents in parts of New York City could not only see the thick smoke coming from across the Hudson, but they could smell it, as well.

Residents were ordered to evacuate and many were sheltered at a nearby school.

As the fire continued to rage, hundreds who lived at the complex wondered what would be left of their homes. By morning, the true extent of the disaster was revealed as smoke billowed from the once gleaming complex's ashes.

'I was wondering what I was going to do for clothes,' Sterling said in an interview with the New York Daily News. 'But then I started thinking about all the stuff, all the memories, whether it be music, books, and a lot of other stuff. 'You know I was planning on moving to a new apartment complex and felt I was going to throw a lot of that stuff out. Now I hope I haven't lost it.'

The Yankees personality is staying at a hotel, the Daily News reported.

'I don't know what to expect. Now, I have nowhere to go. And I need a toothbrush,' Sterling told the paper.

Plumes of thick, black smoke issued from the blaze and residents in Manhattan and the rest of New Jersey were still overcome with the smell of the fire on Thursday morning.

Edgewater Mayor Michael McPartland declared a local state of emergency, according to NJ.com. He said schools would be closed on Thursday and access to roads would be restricted until further notice.

160 people are being sheltered at a local community center but he said he was just relieved there had been no loss of life.

'To have no loss of life and so many people displaced, we actually feel fortunate and thankful,' he said. 'Everyone got out…You can always rebuild.'

Hours after the fire started, the entire building was engulfed in flames, The Bergen Record reported. Hamza Abdul told the newspaper he was at work when a colleague called to tell him about the fire so he rushed home.

'I can't believe it,' he said. 'It's all ashes now.'

He told the newspaper he planned to stay at a friend's house.

Authorities cordoned off some streets around the burning building, but no major traffic problems were reported.

More than 14 years ago, a fire started at the same location where a five-story condominium complex was under construction and destroyed nine homes and damaged several others. The August 30 2000, fire forced the evacuation of dozens of nearby residents, including patients at a nearby nursing home. The cause was never determined, although investigators ruled out arson.

In a civil lawsuit, a jury found that negligence by the developer of the Avalon River Mews contributed to the 2000 blaze. AvalonBay Communities, a Virginia-based developer, was managing the construction of the $75 million complex at the site of the former Alcoa factory.
