A newly-discovered species of woolly rhino that lived in Tibet more than 3.6million years ago could rewrite theories about the evolution of giant Ice Age mammals.

Scientists suspect that the creature led the way in adapting to the harsh Tibetan climate, which in turn may have helped the animal's descendants survive the big freeze to come.

The same could also be true for ancestors of other Ice Age 'megafauna' such as the woolly mammoth, giant sloth and sabre-toothed cat, the experts believe.

The research suggests that the Tibetan plateau may have been an 'evolutionary cradle' for Ice Age giants.

Much has been written about the extinction of Ice Age mammals, but much less is known about their origins.

The new research focused on the complete skull and lower jaw of a new species of woolly rhino, Coelodonta thibetana, discovered in the foothills of the Himalayas at a site called the Zanda Basin.

One special feature of the animal was a flattened horn, which it is thought was used as a snow shovel to reveal edible vegetation.

At the time the rhino was coping with the Himalayan cold, most of the world was warm. The northern continents were free of the massive ice sheets that advanced across much of the globe during the Pleistocene era.

When the Ice Age finally arrived, around 2.6million years ago, the rhinos are believed to have descended from their high-altitude home and expanded throughout northern Asia and Europe.

The U.S. research, published in the journal Science, speculates that the Arctic and Antarctic could have been other 'springboards' for Ice Age evolution.

Lead author Dr Xiaoming Wang, from the Natural History Museum of Los Angeles, said: 'Cold places, such as Tibet, Arctic, and Antarctic, are where the most unexpected discoveries will be made in the future - these are the remaining frontiers that are still largely unexplored.'

As well as the new woolly rhino, the team also found fossil remains of extinct species of three-toed horse, Tibetan bharal or 'blue sheep', chiru or Tibetan antelope, snow leopard, badger, and 23 other kinds of mammals.

Commenting on the findings, Dr Richard Lane, from the U.S. National Science Foundation, said: 'This discovery clarifies the origin of the woolly rhinoceros - and perhaps much of the now extinct, cold-adapted, Pleistocene Eurasian megafauna - as the high-altitude environments of the Zanda Basin of the primordial Pliocene Himalayas.'
