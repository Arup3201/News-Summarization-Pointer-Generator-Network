Ministers splurged almost £100million a day on foreign aid in December in a frantic bid to hit David Cameron’s controversial spending target, a report claims.

The Commons International Development Committee warns today that vast sums appear to have been ‘rushed out at the end of the year’ to meet the target of spending 0.7 per cent of Britain’s total income on foreign aid.

The committee says it is astonishing that the Department for International Development (DfID) spent a quarter of its total budget in one month and calls on ministers to show that the spending was ‘rational and cost-effective’.

Support: The report also accuses ministers of spending too much on 'middle income' countries such as Nigeria, Pakistan (pictured) and India

The report also accuses ministers of spending too much on ‘middle income’ countries such as Nigeria, Pakistan and India, which have the resources to help themselves, rather than focusing aid on the world’s poorest.

MPs in the committee also warned that Britain is shouldering too much of the burden of cleaning up global humanitarian disasters. Britain’s spending on Syria, for example, has hit £600million, compared to just £10million spent by France.

Aid spending averaged £560million a month for the first ten months of last year. It then doubled in November to more than £1.1billion, before soaring to £2.6billion in December as the deadline for hitting the target neared.

Britain’s foreign aid spend is now more 
than double the G8 average. The US spends 0.19 per cent of its total 
income on foreign aid, for France it is 0.45 per cent and Italy is at 
just 0.13 per cent.

Last night, a DfID spokesman denied it had struggled to spend its budget, saying the high spending in December resulted mainly from ‘several long-planned annual contributions to agencies like the World Bank and EU’. 

The spokesman added: ‘DfID constantly assesses where UK aid has the biggest impact to ensure it helps those who really need it.’

Britain spent £11.4billion on foreign aid last year.
