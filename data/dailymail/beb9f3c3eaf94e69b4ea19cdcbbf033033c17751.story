A Canadian man drank eight beers before swimming across the Detroit river to the U.S. to win a bet with friends.

John Morillo, 47, triggered an international search and rescue effort when friends lost sight of him as he crossed the river on Monday night, with a helicopter and boats deployed from both Canada and the U.S. to scour the water for the intoxicated swimmer.

Mr Morillo, who was eventually picked up swimming on the Canadian side by the Coast Guard, has since said he is sorry for the 'really stupid' stunt - but is adamant he made it all the way to Detroit.

'Sorry': John Morillo swam across the Detroit River to the U.S. from Windsor in Canada, sparking an international incident

Bet: Mr Morillo drank eight cans of beer then jumped into the river to win a bet with his friends

The river is 2.5 miles across at its widest point, and half a mile at its narrowest.

According to a report in the Windsor Star, Mr Morillo said yesterday: 'If I’m going to be in the paper, I’d at least like them to say I actually made it, even though I got in trouble and everything.

'I gotta pay fines and stuff. But I don’t want it to sound like I didn’t make it, because then my buddies are going to say "ha, ha, you didn’t make it".

A woman watching Morillo's swim called police around half an hour after she lost sight of him at 11.30pm on Monday night, according to the Windsor Star.

The coast guards in the U.S. and in Canada were alerted and three boats and a helicopter were deployed to the scene in a joint rescue effort.

Rescue effort: The Detroit River, which separates the city from Windsor, Ontario, is 24 miles long and 2.5 miles across at its widest point

He was picked up swimming on the 
Canadian side of the river by the U.S. Coast Guard and charged with 
being intoxicated in a public place.

The Windsor Port Authority is also 
investigating, and the 47-year-old said he was told he could face a fine
of between $5,000 and $25,000 for swimming a shipping lane.

Furious authorities have pointed out the 'extreme danger' of swimming in the waterway, due to a strong undertow in the shipping channel. Swimming in the Detroit River is forbidden under Port Authority regulations.

Mr Morillo said he had been telling 
sceptical friends that he was going to swim across the river 'for 
years', and finally decided to stick to his word, jumping in close to 
the Hiram Walker distillery in Windsor and heading for the Renaissance 
Center on the Detroit side.

He said people on the far side 
spotted him clambering out of the water asked to have their pictures 
taken with him, before he jumped back in to the river to make his way 
back to Windsor.

It was only when he saw helicopters and boats approaching that the commotion he had caused began to dawn on him.

'As soon I saw the helicopters going by and the boats looking for me, I was like "oh, this is really stupid,"'' Mr Morillo said.
