Zookeepers are to give two rare rhinos animal 'viagra' in a bid to get them to mate. 

The two southern white rhinoceros, Rumbull and Rumba, have become long-term partners after spending more than a decade at Noah's Ark Zoo Farm in Wraxall, North Somerset. 

But despite now reaching sexual maturity, the 14-year-old pair have so far failed to conceive naturally despite encouragement.

Zookeepers are to give two rare rhinos animal 'viagra' in a bid to get them to mate at Noah's Ark Zoo Farm in Wraxall, North Somerset

The two southern white rhinoceros Rumbull and Rumba are reaching sexual maturity but the 14-year-old pair have so far failed to conceive naturally despite encouragement

Keepers at the animal park, are now hoping to speed up the process by giving them an aphrodisiac.

Specialists are considering giving the large mammals a special feed pellet high in b-carotene, a compound thought to help reproductive success in rhinos.

Specialist keeper, Emma Green, is also monitoring dung samples for oestrogen levels, the female sex hormone linked with reproductive cycles, to analyse Rumba's fertility.

Miss Green said: 'I've got to know Rumba and Rumbull's habits well over the past few years as I work so closely with them.

'There's a noticeable change in their behaviour recently, sure signs of reaching sexual maturity - it's interesting in particular watching Rumbull as he becomes more dominant.

'We hope they choose to breed when they're ready, and then we will have another mouth to feed.'

Rhino breeding is a complex process due to the fact they are very difficult to predict and births in captivity are quite rare.

The animals have a gestation period of 15 months - one of the longest pregnancies in the animal kingdom after elephants which take a substantial 22 months.

The zoo will be keeping visitors updated with news on the rhino pair via the parks website and Facebook page this year.

There are two subspecies of white rhinos - southern white rhinoceros and the northern white rhinoceros.

There are an estimated 17,460 southern white rhino in the wild, making them by far the most abundant subspecies of rhino in the world.
