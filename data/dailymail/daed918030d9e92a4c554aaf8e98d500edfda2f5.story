He may have been the leader of the free world and she the US Secretary of State, criss-crossing the globe solving international crises - but they both needed their daughter's help to learn how to text.

Chelsea Clinton has revealed her parents, Bill and Hillary, were far from global pioneers when it came to technology and she even had to teach them how to stop their mobile phone batteries from going flat.

The former First Daughter has told a tech conference what it was like growing up in one of the America's most famous and powerful families - and how she learned to debate them on major issues from the age of six.

'I definitely taught my parents how 
to text and how to charge their phones,' Chelsea, 34, said, adding the 
latter was 'a very mysterious thing' for her parents.

Of the mock debates the family would have at home in Arkansas, she told how she would argue with one of her parents and the other would act as moderator.

After delivering her keynote speech at 
the South by Southwest conference in Austin, Texas on Tuesday, Chelsea 
said she was slowly changing her mind about whether to run for office 
herself in coming years, according to Buzzfeed.

Chelsea Clinton said using - and charging - mobile phones was a mystery to her parents

'I donâ€™t know,' she said. 'For a long time, my answer to that question was no.

'At the moment I find it pretty 
discouraging that almost none of my friends think about running for 
public office as an option.'

When her father 
graduated from Georgetown University about half of his friends were considering 
entering public life.

'His ambition was not unique,' she said.

Chelsea has an increasingly prominent role in the recently renamed Bill, Hillary and Chelsea Clinton Foundation, a job that 'right now' gives her more satisfaction than the prospect of entering politics.
