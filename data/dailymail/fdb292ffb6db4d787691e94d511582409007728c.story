Residents of a Spanish town are to vote on changing its name because it contains the phrase ‘kill Jews’ – which is a local expression used to describe drinking lemonade.

Castrillo de Matajudíos situated in León, Spain, will convene its 60 residents at a town hall meeting to discuss the possibility of changing the name to something less controversial.

In parts of Spain, many residents use the term ‘kill Jews’ (mata judios) to describe the tradition of drinking lemonade spiked with alcohol at city centre festivals over Easter.

The name of Castrillo de Matajudíos currently translates to 'kill Jews' - which is a local expression used to describe lemonade

The town’s name originates from medieval times, when converted Jews would sometimes be publicly executed in show trials over the Easter period.

However, Mayor Lorenzo Rodriguez, who submitted the proposal, has now suggested changing the town’s name to Castrillo de Mota de Judios, which translates to ‘Castrillo of Jews hill’.

In Leon, Spain, ‘kill Jews’ (mata judios) is a slang term which refers to the drinking of lemonade which has been spiked with alcohol.

There are several theories as to when the term was coined although it almost certainly came from medieval times, when converted Jews would sometimes be publicly executed in show trials around Easter.

Some theories suggest it was born out of the relationship in the area between Christian residents and Jewish residents.

It is one belief that the term was related to the charge of Jewish deicide which suggested that Jewish people as a whole were responsible for the death of Jesus Christ.

Castrillo de Matajudíos’ town mayor, Lorenzo Rodriguez, said the town was given its name following the Spanish Inquisition began in 1478.

Today, the legacy of the Spanish Inquisition lives on in the country with the terms ‘matar judíos’ and ‘matajudíos,’ both used in reference to the inquisition.

The term, which means ‘kill Jews’, also appears in colloquial language and place names, as well as some family names.

It is more commonly used by locals in reference to 'drinking lemonade', especially over the Easter period when residents populate city centre squares to drink lemonade spiked with alcohol as part of annual festival celebrations.

He said it was the town’s original name but it was changed during the Spanish Inquisition.

The town has discussed changing the name before but no official move had been taken until the mayor put forward the firm proposal in writing.

Residents will decide on April 19 what the town’s name will be changed to – if at all – and a vote will be taken, with the majority verdict signalling the decision to be taken.

Mayor Rodríguez told Spanish daily newspaper Diario de Burgos: ‘The majority decision will be respected, even if it is only by one vote.’

He also explained that the town changed its name to ‘Matajudíos’ after the Spanish Inquisition began in 1478.

Castrillo is situated adjacent to the larger town of Castrojeriz, which had one of the earliest Jewish communities in Spain.

According to the town’s website, equal rights were given to Jews and Christians in the town in 974.

Rodríguez said after a massacre of Jews in Castrojeriz in 1035, many fled to nearby Castrillo. There was later another massacre in Castillo in 1109.

Maria Royo, a spokesperson for the Federation of Jewish Communities of Spain, told the Jewish Telegraphic Agency that the ‘kill Jews’ (mata judios) phrase comes from medieval times.

It is a term which is widely used in Spanish circles and there is even a ‘Mata Judios’ fiesta to be held on Good Friday where organisers estimate 40,000 gallons of lemonade will be sold.

Ms Royo said: ‘Regrettably, this type of expression exists in Spain in ceremonies and parties.

‘The people saying it are mostly unaware of the history. It is a complicated issue that is ingrained in local culture.’
