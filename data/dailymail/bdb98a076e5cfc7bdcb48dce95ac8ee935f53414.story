A 17-stone pot-bellied pig scared off a gang of burglars who attempted to raid a family's home on New Year's Eve. 

Ludwig the pig faced the raiders inside Mike Maughan and his partner Liane Scholz's home in Derby. 

The couple, who lived in the house for two months before the raid have now pledged never to eat pork again because of the bravery of their pig.

The couple, who are originally from Canada believe that Ludwig, pictured, chased the burglars away 

Mr Maughan said: 'The noise he makes is like a low rumble that sounds like the biggest Rottweiler you can imagine so I think they just ran.

'It was New Year’s Eve and when we came down in the morning, the door was wide open.

'The room was still warm so they can’t have been there for that long.

'They must have woken Ludwig up and when he realised that we weren’t up and would have been disturbed he sprang into action.

'There were things in there they could have taken, like a bike, but they just left.'

The couple, from Canada, adopted Ludwig after he was handed into an animal rescue centre in their native country. However, when they moved to Britain, Ludwig was almost prevented from coming as local authorities did not have the correct paperwork to export a pet pig. 

Mr Maughan, right, said the raiders were probably scared off by Ludwig's incredibly low growl

Ms Scholz said: 'He is actually the first pot-bellied pig to be exported from Canada as a pet.

'The options on the form were fattening, which is a no-no as he is fat enough as it is, slaughter is clearly not going to happen and breeding, which he can’t do because he is fixed.

'So after many phone calls, the Canadian government actually added an extra box to the form that says pet!

'We are the people that buy pets for our pets.

'At the time, we had a little cockatiel who would fly around the house but she was afraid of other birds.

'I didn’t want to get a dog or a cat. I tried to get Mike interested in lots of different exotic animals and we settled on a pig.

'I spent two years doing research. Pigs are a nice pet because they are very intelligent but there is a trade-off.

'A pig is like a two or three-year-old toddler but he is a toddler who will never grow up and they live to around 20.

'When we first got him back and he was only a couple of months old, we put a litter tray down for him. But he got confused and had an accident on the kitchen floor.

'But I showed him where it was and then four hours later he went to his litter box and we have never had an accident since.'

Ms Scholz, right, said there are many misconceptions about the cleanliness of having a pet pig 

Keeping Ludwig clean often only involves brushing him, or on occasion using dog shampoo

The couple said that much of the time Ludwig was too lazy to cause any damage to their home

Ms Scholz said there were many misconceptions concerning having a pig for a pet. 

She said: 'Pigs like to be clean. He doesn’t have much of a coat so when he gets dirty you just give him a brush down with a broom.

'Or if he is particularly unclean, or needs to be extra fancy, then he might have some dry dog shampoo.

'He goes to the toilet in the back yard like a dog would and we just clean up after him.'

Originally the couple moved from Canada and wanted to settle in London but they faced significant problems over their house guest. 

She revealed: 'I moved over a couple of months before and was actually living in London but none of the landlords would allow me to have a pig!

'As a house animal, he is well behaved and isn’t a destructive animal but I could see the potential for it. It’s the same with a dog. They get destructive because they are bored.'

Ms Scholz, left, believes that she is able to communicate with Ludwig, right, using sign language

The couple imported the unusual pet with them when they moved to the UK from Canada 

According to Ms Scholz, Ludwig, pictured, can be quite an emotional animal even though he is tough 

Ms Scholz said it was important that they trained Ludwig and she believes that she is now even able to communicate with the 17-stone animal 

'So we make him little treat boxes that he has to figure out and he has toddler toys and dog toys.

“He never wrecks the yards, though, because he is just too lazy. When you tell him to do something, he wants to know what the outcome will be.

'So he won’t just do things on command but he knows the words for things and I have started using sign language with him now as well, which seems to be working.

'He is also a very emotional animal, as tough as he is physically, if he is really naughty I will shame him and send him outside. Then he cries and he actually sheds tears.

'Our bond is incredible - he only gets up when we get up. Until then he stays pretty quiet.

'The noises he makes are quite a nice low-decibel level generally, unless you are trying to make him do something he doesn’t want to, then it just sounds like he is being slaughtered!'
