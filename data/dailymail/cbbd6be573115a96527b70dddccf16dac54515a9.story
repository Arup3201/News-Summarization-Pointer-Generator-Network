Most women who decide on cosmetic surgery save up for years, take out a loan or even a second job.

But for Gemini Smith, 23, from Cramlington, Northumbria, it was much easier - in fact all she had to do was sign up to MyFreeImplants.com, where users donated a dollar to her operation every time they sent her a message.

After three months, Miss Smith had raised the £4,450 needed to send her from a 34A to a 34DD.

Never been happier: Gemini Smith, 23, plunged into depression before online strangers on MyFreeImplants.com funded her 34DD boob job

Dream come true: Gemini Smith, 23, had been unhappy with her size 34A breasts since her teens which she said made her look like a '12-year-old boy'

Miss Smith, an undertaker, always hated her 34A breasts which, she thought, made her look like a '12-year-old boy'.

She fell into 
depression, but her hopes were boosted when she discovered 
MyFreeImplants.com, an American website where strangers donate towards 
cosmetic surgery.

She made the decision to have them enlarged but struggled to save for the operation and only managed to find a fraction of

The site 
has grown in popularity and Miss Smith is thought to be one of thousands of 
British women now signing up to attract would-be benefactors.

She managed to raise her target in just three months, overtaking most women
 who have been members of the site for three to four years.

She has now undergone the surgery which has seen her grow to a 34DD.

And the operation has boosted her confidence so much she has since got engaged to a man she was previously chatting to on Facebook.

She
 said: 'When I was 16 I just didn't develop at all, whereas all the 
other girls in my class in PE were all developed and had a decent sized 
chest I just looked like a 12-year-old boy.

Sitting pretty: Gemini Smith, 23, from Northumbria says she was 'over the moon' when strangers coughed up enough cash for her boob job which saw her go from 34A to 34DD

'It was having an effect on my social 
life and knocked my confidence, I was always bullied in school and this 
just knocked me even more.

'I was depressed really and it was awful, I used to wear big jumpers to cover everything up, I hated them.

'I
 always said I wanted a boob job but when I got a job I couldn't save up
 the kind of money needed in the time scale I wanted because I was so 
desperate.

'The website MyFreeImplants.com looked really genuine with the possibility to do what I wanted to do, how I wanted to do it.

'When I raised the amount I was absolutely over the moon.'

Happy customer: Gemini, from Cramlington, Northumbria, joined MyFreeImplants.com in July 2013 and spoke to dozens of men and women a week who donated a dollar for every message sent to her

On the website women create a profile with photos detailing why they want a breast augmentation and explain why they cannot afford it.

Men,
 called 'benefactors' then buy 'chat credits' which allow them to talk 
to girls through private messages or face-to-face via webcams.

They also have the option to make larger donations to women of their choice.

Miss Smith joined the site in July 2013, spoke to 
dozens of men and women a week and received a dollar for every message 
sent to her.

She added: 
'It's more like a social network site but because of the nature of what you 
are wanting done people expect you, or want you, to show something or do
 something.

'Personally I 
didn't do anything I didn't want to for money, I just said if you are 
going to help me and talk to me then it is because you like me for me, 
not for what I can do.

'I made quite a few genuine friends on there who I can talk to about anything and everything.'

After
 reaching her total the money was transferred straight to a surgeon of 
Miss Smith's choice and she had her breast enhancement in Manchester on November
 14.

She said: 'If I could do it again I would, it was a great place to meet people and it has just made me so much happier.

'I
 just wanted to look like I was born with them all developed really, I 
wasn't looking for over the top, and the surgeon was so nice.

'I can finally wear low cut tops and feel good about myself, although I still find myself covering up out of habit.

'The
 surgery was just for me, it wasn't for anyone else, it was just to 
raise my confidence, and it has done that so much more than I could have
 hoped.

'If anyone asked me if they should do it I would tell them to straight away, it is the best decision I ever made.'

Mrs Barton is one of thousands of women who make use of MyFreeImplants.com. She has been using the site for four years in a bid to raise $6,980 (£4,174) for surgery to enlarge her breasts from size AA to DD cup.

'I have always been insecure about my breasts,' said Mrs Barton, 34, who lives with her husband Clive and daughter Phoenix, nine. She also has a son, Cheyenne, 17.

She talks to dozens of men a week and receives a dollar for every message she receives.

Men can also give one-off donations to girls of their choice.

'I
 have gained real friendships and use it as an outlet to socialise and 
talk about my problems,' said Mrs Barton.

'The men know everything about me. My husband understands. He loves me the way I am but he knows it is an issue for me.'

Mrs Barton has raised $832 (£497) through the messaging system and $4,535 (£2,711) in one-off donations with one generous donor giving her $1,500 (£896).

'This surgery means the world to me,' she says.
