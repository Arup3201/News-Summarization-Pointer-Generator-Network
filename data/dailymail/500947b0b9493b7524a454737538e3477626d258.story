PetMatch uses photos to search for similar-looking animals in the local area that are up for adoption

If cloning your recently deceased pet is a step too far, an app will now find an almost near replica.

Called PetMatch, it uses images of either an old pet, an animal that belongs to a friend, or just a favourite breed to search for similar ones nearby.

The app only searches for animals that are up for adoption in the user’s local area, and as a result the service is only available in certain areas.

PetMatch was launched by Californian start-up Superfish, which specialises in image search algorithms.

Animals lovers upload a photo to PetMatch, or use a sample image from the gallery, and the app will search a database of pets for animals with similar features.

It uses Superfish’s patented image recognition technology to perform what’s called geometric analysis.

This includes scanning images to plot and match the distance between the animal’s eyes, the angle of its mouth, its face shape and its colour. 

Users can then browse a list of potential matches before clicking through to a profile and learning more about the dog, and the centre where it is up for adoption.

These results can be filtered by similarity or distance, and favourite images can be stored for later.

In April, scientists produced the first cloned dog in Britain after its owner won a competition to have her elderly pet replicated.

Rebecca Smith, 29, from west London, put her elderly dachshund, Winnie, forward to be cloned in a £60,000 competition organised by South Korean tech firm, Sooam Biotech.

She won, and the cloned puppy, called Mini Winnie, was conceived in a test tube and born in Seoul on 30 March.

It isn't designed purely to replace deceased pets. It can be used for anyone looking to adopt a cat or dog.

The service is currently only available in the U.S and only cats and dogs are featured.

It is unclear when it will launch in other regions and whether it will add other animals.

‘PetMatch is a faster, more intuitive way to bring you closer to finding exactly what you’re looking for,’ explained the developers.

‘Behind the scenes, PetMatch uses Superfish’s patented image recognition technology to find similar adoptable pets in your area [and] gives you all the information you need to connect with the adoption agency.’

Superfish was founded in 2006 by Adi Pinhas and Michael Chertok.

The company also has an app called Window Shopping that helps shoppers find similar clothing items to ones they have in their wardrobe, or have seen in a magazine.
