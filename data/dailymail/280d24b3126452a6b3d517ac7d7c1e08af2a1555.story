A man who fatally punched a holidaymaker then danced over him like a boxer was sentenced to prison Thursday for at least six years.

Dylan Closter was 18 when he roundhouse punched David Cassai in an unprovoked attack in the Victorian coastal town of Rye on New Year's Eve 2012.

Mr Cassai suffered a fractured skull when his head struck the pavement, and died hours later.

Justice Elizabeth Hollingworth said David Cassai and his friends took a defensive position and were trying to defuse the situation and retreat when Dylan Closter and two of his friends attacked

Closter, now 20, pleaded guilty to manslaughter and affray in Cassai's killing. Justice Elizabeth Hollingworth sentenced him to nine years and three months in prison, with a non-parole period of six years.

Justice Hollingworth described how Mr Cassai and some friends were confronted by another group, which included Closter. Mr Cassai and his friends took a defensive position and were trying to defuse the situation and retreat when Closter and two of his friends attacked.

After Closter knocked Mr Cassai to the ground, he bounced on the balls of his feet in a boxing stance before fleeing.

As Closter's group fled, witnesses heard laughing and someone yelling out 'that's what we come here for', the Victorian Supreme Court heard.

Justice Hollingworth said Closter handed himself into police out of pragmatism rather than remorse, given the number of witnesses and surveillance video and said that Closter initially claimed he was acting in self-defence.

'What happened that night was entirely of your making,' the judge told the accused.

'The affray involved a violent, frightening and completely unprovoked attack by you and members of your group on another group, in the middle of the night, on a public street, at a busy time of year.

'In the space of less than a minute, multiple punches had been thrown, one man was dead and five others were injured.'

David Cassai's mother Caterina Politi said the sentence highlighted the need for Victoria's mandatory 10-year minimum terms for one-punch deaths

David Cassai was killed on new year's eve 2012 when attacked by Dylan Closter on the streets of Rye. In handing down sentence Justice Hollingworth told his assailant 'this was very much a one-sided attack, you started the affray and remained the principal aggressor throughout'

'They just went out (to) celebrate a birthday and they just wanted to get home. They were ambushed and they had no chance' David Cassai's mother told reporters after his attacker Dylan Closter was jailed

Mr Cassai's mother Caterina Politi said the sentence highlighted the need for Victoria's mandatory 10-year minimum terms for one-punch deaths.

'Six years minimum, it'll never be enough, but it doesn't send a message of deterrence and punishment for a man who took my son's life,' she told reporters outside court.

'People waste their lives on the dole for five years and six years. Ten years is more significant.'

Ms Politi said her son and his friends posed no threat to anyone that night.

'They just went out (to) celebrate a birthday and they just wanted to get home. They were ambushed and they had no chance,' she said.

One of Cassai's friends, Tyrone Steven Russell, 23, from Perth, was jailed for 15 months with an eight-month minimum.

He pleaded guilty to recklessly causing injury, and affray, over the attack on Mr Cassai's friends.

A third man, Thomas McCluskey-Sharpe, 26, of Kilsyth, has indicated he will plead guilty to his involvement in the fight with Mr Cassai's friends.

"Six years minimum, it'll never be enough, but it doesn't send a message of deterrence and punishment for a man who took my son's life' said David Cassai's mother Caterina Politi
