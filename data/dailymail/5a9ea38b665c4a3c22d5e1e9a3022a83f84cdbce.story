Billionaire politician Clive Palmer has been dismissed as a 'flash in the pan' like Pauline Hanson and Bob Katter by acting Prime Minister Warren Truss.

Mr Truss, who is filling in for Tony Abbott while he is overseas, said Mr Palmer could go the way of other political 'saviours' including the former Queensland MP Pauline Hanson.

'We have had plenty of saviours in the past, like Pauline Hanson and Bob Katter,' Mr Truss told reporters at the NSW Nationals conference in Queanbeyan.

'They all made a little bit of an impact for a while.'

The Nationals leader said those who voted for Mr Palmer in protest at last year's federal election were putting their country at risk.

Mr Palmer was the big winner at the 2013 federal election, gaining his own seat and three Senate spots.

Pauline Hanson roared onto the Australian political landscape in 1996 but was only in federal parliament for a single term.

Despite big predictions, the vote for the Katter's Australian Party of long time Queensland MP Bob Katter was disappointing at the last election, and Mr Katter's personal vote slumped.

Mr Truss said there was always a protest vote.

'Sometimes these people will gain support from that element,' he said.

'Those who throw away their vote in some kind of protest are in fact ignoring their obligations to their democracy but also putting their country at risk.'

Mr Truss added that the coalition took its responsibilities seriously and would get on with the job of delivering what was important for Australia.

He said other parties could worry about themselves.
