Carlo Ancelotti will not have to look too far in his search for a starting XI that copes with the absence of Gareth Bale – the team he put out on Saturday without the Welshman won 5-0 and gave Real Madrid's best performance of the season.

Bale's injury now looks certain to rule him out of this weekend's Clasico as well as Wednesday night's Champions League group B game at Anfield. But with £30million Spain Under 21 European Champion and former Manchester City target Isco to come in there is no real concern that Real Madrid, who will also be without central defender Sergio Ramos, will be weakened.

Some Madrid watchers even belive that for all of Bale and Cristiano Ronaldo's brilliance, against better sides who keep the ball well, Real are better with only one of their powerful sprint forwards in the team.

Real Madrid's probable XI against Liverpool

Last season in the Spanish Cup final Ronaldo was missing and Ancelotti played a 4-4-2 with Bale and Karim Benzema up front and it was enough to defeat Barcelona in what was the first of two trophies Real won.

On Wednesday night he will repeat that formula with Benzema pairing up with Ronaldo and James Rodriguez, Luca Modric, Toni Kroos and Isco making up a midfield four. One of Ancelotti's challenges when he arrived was to make Madrid play a little more like Barcelona – with that midfield he can send out a team capable of passing any rival into submission.

Isco has had a difficult time since signing a year ago and soon being overtaken by Bale but now is his chance. 'What we have lost in gallop, we have gained in control' said one Madrid commentator on Tuesday underlining the sense that Isco will keep the ball better than Bale making up for the Welshman's more explosive qualities.

Bale's injury to the pyramidalis muscle located deep with in the Gluteus muscle group could be related to a long term herniated spinal disc problem discovered during his Real Madrid medical according to Spanish specialist Ricardo Garcia Oviedo. He said: 'It could be related because a player can strain other areas in the lumbar region an attempt to over compensate for the hernia,' he said.

Disc hernias are not uncommon in sportsman and Bale finished last season strongly scoring in the European Cup final but he has played 1,319 minutes already so far this season, including 180 minutes for Wales. He could now miss up to five games in a two-week recovery period.
