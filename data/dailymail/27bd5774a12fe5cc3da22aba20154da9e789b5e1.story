Electric cars may help cut down on fossil fuel use, but their limited range has so far been their downfall.

Now, BMW believes it has come up with a solution by using street lighting to charge up cars while they're parked, allowing them to run for longer.

The German car manufacturer said it will run a pilot project in Munich next year that uses existing local authority lighting networks to power their vehicles.

BMW has made two prototype 'Light and Charge' street lights, which combine Light Emitting Diodes (LED) with the company's ChargeNow recharging stations.

'Seamless charging infrastructure is essential if we want to see more electric vehicles on the road in our cities in the future,' Peter Schwarzenbauer, member of the board of management of BMW AG, said.

The Munich pilot will install the first charging lights, which can be grafted straight onto the existing local authority street lighting infrastructure, BMW said.

These additional charging stations can be used by as many drivers as possible, regardless of vehicle model and electricity provider.

The company  has already developed some of the most advanced electric cars, including the i3 city vehicle and i8 hybrid.

But electric cars have struggled to gain widespread popularity due to their limited operating range, the scarcity of charging stations and the time it takes to recharge them.

Motorways are to become ‘electric superhighways’ in an attempt to persuade drivers to switch to battery-powered cars.

‘Supercharging stations’ are to be installed on several major roads by the end of the year, enabling electric cars to travel across the country in one trip for the first time.

Billionaire entrepreneur Elon Musk is fitting the devices, which can charge the Tesla electric cars his company makes, in 20 minutes, giving a range of 130 miles (209km) .

This is significantly faster than most current electric cars, which often require overnight charging and have a range of under 100 miles (160km).

It means electric car owners will be able to drive large distances across Britain without concerns about running out of power, known as ‘range anxiety’.

The first network will stretch from Dover to London along the M20, cover the entire M25 and follow the M4 from London to Bristol and the M1 and M6 to Manchester via Birmingham.

Tesla declined to say which service stations would be used, but installation work was reported to be almost complete on the South Mimms services at the junction of the M25 and the A1 in Hertfordshire. 

In addition to developing street lighting, BMW has already invested in software and applications that aim to help drivers of electric cars find parking spaces and charging stations.

The group also recently met with rival Tesla Motors to discuss the availability of electric vehicle charging stations.

In September, Daimler said it had bought my taxi and RideScout, two smartphone applications that will help the maker of Mercedes-Benz limousines provide services to people who do not own cars.
