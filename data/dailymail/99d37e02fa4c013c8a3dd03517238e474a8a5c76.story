Hormone replacement therapy raises women's risk of getting brain a tumour by 30 per cent, according to researchers.

Women who take medication to relieve the symptoms of the menopause could therefore be putting themselves in danger of cancer and other illnesses.

For those who use HRT over a period of time, the risk of developing a tumour is as high as 70 per cent.

Scientists from the Danish Cancer Research Centre found a link between post-menopausal hormone treatment and meningioma, the most common type of brain tumour, according to The Sun.

'Long-term HRT use, particularly of combined oestrogen-progestogen, may increase the risk of meningioma,' researchers from the centre said.

HRT raises the risk of the tumour by 30 per cent, while women who use the medication for a decade or more have a two-thirds risk of developing meningioma.

While 85 per cent of tumours are benign and do not develop into a cancer, meningioma can cause other damaging symptoms.

Tumour sufferers are prone to headaches, hearing loss and even seizures.

The new research could explain why women are more likely to get brain tumours than men.

It also appears that meningiomas have become more common over the past few years, which could be due to the increasing popularity of HRT.

Hormones such as oestrogen are prescribed to middle-aged women to alleviate symptoms of the menopause such as hot flushes and joint pain.

However, HRT has previously been linked to an increased risk of serious conditions such as cancer, heart attacks and strokes.

Cancer Research UK recommends that women use HRT for as short a time as possible to minimise the possibility of adverse side effects.
