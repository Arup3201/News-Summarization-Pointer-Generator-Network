These fascinating pictures show the hoard of nuts collected by a squirrel who stole them from a bird table before stashing them away under the bonnet of a Honda Civic.

The animal helped itself to food left out for the birds in the garden of a Gloucestershire property before crawling inside the engine of the car and hiding them in the air filter.

The secret stash of nuts was only discovered when the owner of the Honda Civic 1.6 took her vehicle to the garage because she couldn't work out why it wouldn't go above 40mph.

The squirrel is thought to have taken the nuts, which were left out on a bird table in a Gloucestershire garden, before climbing inside the  homeowner's Honda Civic 1.6 and stuffing them in the vehicle's air filter (pictured)

The secret stash of nuts was only discovered when the owner of the Honda Civic 1.6, who does not wish to be named, took her vehicle to the garage because she couldn't work out why it wouldn't go more than 40mph

Mechanic David Evans (pictured with the nuts seized from the Honda) said he had 'never seen anything like it'

Mechanics at DPE Autosport in Poole Keynes, near Kemble, in the Cotswolds, were left baffled as to the cause of the problem until they removed the cover to the air filter and found the nuts.

David Evans, who owns the garage, said he ran a complete set of tests before making the discovery.

He said: 'It was rammed solid with nuts. I've been doing this job for 18 years and I've never seen anything like it. I couldn't believe it'.

He, along with colleague Helen Plaister, spent an hour sucking the nuts out of the air filter with a vacuum cleaner and collected enough to fill half of a supermarket carrier bag.

Mr Evans added: 'I can't be certain, it could have been a mouse, but I think it was more likely a squirrel.

'The owner was as shocked as we were. She'd been leaving nuts on a bird table in the back garden, and somebody had been helping himself to them.

'He'd been getting into the garage, where she parked the car, and had been climbing right inside the engine bay and squeezing himself into the air filter.

'He kept on doing until he couldn't get any more in.'

Mr Evans had initially suspected a problem with the catalytic converter but discovered the nut stash after a series of diagnostic tests failed to reveal what the problem was.

Ms Plaister, who has worked at the firm for five years, said: 'The lady whose car it is had obviously been feeding the birds and a squirrel or a mouse had stashed them in the car.

'It was quite fascinating. When we took the air filter lid off we were just gobsmacked.'

The car's owner declined to comment on the matter.
