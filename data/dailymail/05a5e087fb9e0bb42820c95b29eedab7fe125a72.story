Tragic: Winnie Johnson never stopped her fight to find her son's body

Winnie Johnson, the mother of moors murder victim Keith Bennett never stopped her fight to find her son's body and vowed to keep on searching 'until the end of her days.'

But this morning, after a 48-year campaign, she tragically died in a Manchester hospice after battling cancer.

The last time Winnie Johnson saw her 12-year-old son Keith was when he waved goodbye as he walked to his grandmother’s house in Longsight, Manchester, on June 16, 1964.

But he was snatched off the street by Ian Brady and Myra Hindley – the third of their five known victims.

For 20 years, Mrs Johnson never knew 
what happened to her son until Brady and Hindley confessed to murdering 
him on Saddleworth Moor, Greater Manchester.

He is the only one of their five victims whose body has never been recovered.

Mrs Johnson, who was 78, made several thousand trips to the Moors in search of her son and has written to every prime minister since he disappeared, begging for help.

Even recently, with her health failing, she refused to give up, employing private firms with sniffer dogs to try to locate Keith’s remains.

At the time she said: ‘I’ll never stop searching until he’s found. I’ll go on and on until I bring him home. When he’s found, I’ll know I’ve done my duty as a mother. I’ll be at ease then.’

Mrs Johnson, who was gravely ill in a hospice with terminal cancer, had written ‘hundreds’ of letters to Brady begging him to reveal where Keith’s body is buried before she died, including a heartfelt plea in December revealing the extent of her illness.

But, as had happened countless times before, Brady was unmoved by her dying plea and failed to reply.

‘He’s just playing games. I can’t get over it,’ she said.

Her
death comes just days after revelations that a bombshell letter written
by Ian Brady supposedly reveals where he and Myra Hindley buried her 
12-year-old son in 1964.

Mercifully, perhaps, Mrs Johnson was too ill to be told of the latest claims of Brady’s letter.

Her hopes of finally laying Keith to 
rest were stoked in 2003 after detectives from Greater Manchester Police
launched a special investigation, Operation Maida, in a bid to find the
remains.

Brady coldly refused to help with 
this endeavour, dismissing officers with a wave of his hand from his bed
when they visited him at Ashworth.

At
a memorial service for Keith, held at Manchester Cathedral in February 
2010, Mrs Johnson finally got the chance to remember her eldest son with
a poignant memorial service.

She wept as she told the congregation at Manchester Cathedral 
how her life's wish was to find Keith and bury his remains before she 
died.

A woman whose daughter was murdered and her body never found paid tribute to Winnie Johnson's tireless courage today.

Jean Taylor's daughter Chantel was killed in 2004 in Birkenhead, Merseyside, and Mrs Taylor - the founder of Families Fighting for Justice - was left tortured not being able to provide a proper burial.

Murderer Stephen Wynne used a saw to dismember the mother-of-three's body and her family were only able to bury some bones.

Today she said she believed Mrs Johnson, 78, always thought she would be given some peace by discovering where her 12-year-old son Keith Bennett was buried.

And she said if there is an afterlife, Mrs Johnson will be reunited with Keith.

'It's terrible news, how awful,' she said.

'I had met her through Families Fighting for Justice.

'Being in a similar situation as Winnie, not to find your child's body causes a tangible pain.

'For a child to be murdered is one of the worst things that can happen to a mother and then not to be able to say goodbye, that is all she lived for and she pleaded with Brady.'

Mrs Taylor criticised Brady for tormenting her by refusing to disclose the schoolboy's burial spot.

'Killers like these have to have control,' she said.

'They get off on knowing because they get self-gratification as Brady did.

'I'm Keith's mother,' Mrs Johnson, who
was helped to the cathedral lectern by a young family friend, sobbed. 
'I've lived through this life knowing he is on those Moors. I just want 
him back.

'I'll do anything, go anywhere for him. As long as I know one day, I'll be grateful.

'I hope he's found before I am dead. All I want out of life is to find him and bury him. I just wish he is found before I go.'

During the hour-long service, Mrs Johnson spoke in front of a large painting of her son based on the famous black and white photo of the smiling youngster.

Keith, the congregation heard, was a cheerful child, and, in a time when children's experiences were confined to the neighbourhood where they were born, he enjoyed street games, marbles and cycling.

He was a young boy with a 'happy-go-lucky attitude and a cheeky grin', who kept leaves in a scrapbook, collected coins and loved football.

Mrs Johnson then appealed directly to Brady to reveal the whereabouts of Keith's remains, via a DVD.

On the DVD, recorded in April 2011, she said she was receiving treatment for cancer of the womb, adding: 'I've got cancer and if you've got any decency or respect for yourself and for me, you would tell me where Keith is because that is the last thing I want to happen before I die.'

'I'm doing it in the hope he will respond – that’s if he watches it,' Mrs Johnson, from Longsight, Manchester, told The People.

'The most important thing is to find Keith before the cancer beats me.

'He knows where Keith is but I think he enjoys having that last bit of power – and if I find Keith he’ll have nothing left.

Her marathon quest for justice has been an emotional roller coaster requiring unprecedented courage and determination.

Last year she refused to back the 
return of the death penalty insisting 'hanging is too quick' and child 
murderers must be made to suffer.

She said: 'Hanging is too quick. 
Child killers like Brady must be made to suffer, in the way he hurt my 
Keith and all the other little ones.

'The rope is too simple a solution 
for his sort. Serial killers like him need to be left to rot, for years,
when hopefully they will reflect on their appalling crimes.

'People could be forgiven for 
thinking I would be among the first demanding a return to capital 
punishment, but that is too soft a sentence for Brady.

'I really hope that he has suffered 
over the years and now, maybe in the twilight of his life, he will 
display a single shred of sympathy by telling me where Keith's remains 
are located.

'The gesture would mean so much, especially as all police searches for Keith's body have officially ended.

'If Brady had swung for his crimes 
against my son and the others, there would have been no chance - however
slim it is - of him relenting and putting me out of my misery by 
pinpointing Keith's grave.'

In 1995, Mrs Thompson was outraged when the Royal Academy of Art displayed a portrait of Myra Hindley, made of children's fingerprints was put on display.

She put together a protest group for the duration of the show and urged visitors to boycott it.

When the organisers refused to remove it, protests became even stronger and two visitors managed to throw eggs at Marcus' Harvey’s canvas, forcing it to undergo a quick restoration.

Along with  Sheila Kilbride, mother of moors murder victim John Kilbride, Winnie Johnson went to DowNing Street and delivered a 'Time To Fit The Crime' petition, 
launched by members of Mothers Against Murder And Aggression, calling 
for life sentences to mean 'real life'.
