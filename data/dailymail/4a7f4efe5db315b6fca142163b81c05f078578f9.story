A couple who tried to extort cash from an amateur photographer by threatening to expose his allegedly sleazy lifestyle are facing prison.

Garry Faulds, 21, and his fiancée Laura Colquhoun, 17, hatched a plot to force the 53-year-old to hand over large amounts of money.

The High Court in Edinburgh heard that the man, who cannot be named for legal reasons, spent more than a year taking pictures of Colquhoun, an aspiring model.

He said she repeatedly performed a sex act on him and received £150 per photo session.

The court was told the teenager allowed her boyfriend, dressed in a balaclava and boiler suit, into the local government worker’s Edinburgh home.

Once inside, Faulds bound the man’s arms, legs and mouth together with gaffer tape and threatened him with a gas canister.

He repeatedly struck the man and told him he was a member of an Ulster loyalist terror group who could cause him serious harm.

He also said he would tell the man’s employers that he was taking illegal photographs of underage girls.

The man has never been charged or prosecuted in connection with Faulds’ claims.

The amateur photographer also claimed Faulds held a gun to his head during his ordeal, but the jury concluded there was not enough evidence to prove this.

The pair were only caught after their victim notified his bosses. They brought in the police, who apprehended Faulds and Colquhoun days after the incident last summer.

The story emerged after Faulds and Colquhoun, of Paisley, Renfrewshire, were convicted yesterday of robbing, assaulting and threatening to extort cash from the man at an address in Edinburgh on August 23 last year.

The jury took two hours and 40 minutes to return guilty verdicts.

Colquhoun wept, shook and sucked her thumb as prosecutor David Taylor told the court she had no previous convictions. The court heard that Faulds has convictions for minor offences.

The victim, an amateur photographer, said Laura Colquhoun, 17, pictured, repeatedly performed a sex act on him during their photo shoot sessions

Temporary judge Paul Arthurson, QC, remanded Faulds – described as a prisoner at Low Moss prison in Bishopbriggs, near Glasgow – in custody. Colquhoun was granted bail.

Judge Arthurson deferred sentence on the pair for reports. He told them: ‘You have both been convicted of a serious offence which will almost inevitably result in prison sentences.’

At the start of proceedings on Monday, the jury of nine women and six men listened as prosecutors read the contents of a legal document outlining the pair’s actions.

The document stated that on August 23 last year at an address in Edinburgh, the duo entered the photographer’s house and detained him there against his will.

They assaulted him, repeatedly punching him on the head, causing the man to fall to the ground.

They then tied his wrists and dragged him bodily into another room.

Faulds then menaced the photographer with a blowtorch and forced him to provide them with passwords and access to his computers and bank accounts.

Prosecutors originally stated that a gun was held to the man’s head and that he was forced to contact a bank employee in an attempt to obtain a new access code to an online account.

Faulds and Colquhoun then forced him to hand over a bank card and a PIN number and used the card to withdraw £100 from an ATM machine.

The pair also robbed him of approximately £800 of money, a quantity of photographic equipment, a set of keys, a Royal Bank of Scotland smart card and smart card reader.

Both Faulds and Colquhoun also threatened to disclose details of the man’s personal life and activities to his employers and other persons unless he gave them cash. The pair then tried to extort a further £500 from him.

Faulds and Colquhoun pleaded not guilty to a single charge and did not give evidence to explain their position.

References to a firearm being used during the frightening attack were deleted as there was not enough evidence available to the jury to bring a conviction on the claim.

The two lovers will be sentenced at the High Court in Edinburgh next month.
