A dog walker sparked a major rescue operation involving more than 20 police officers after shouting out the name of her pet Yelp - which was mistaken for cries of 'help!'.

A worried member of the public called police after hearing the muffled shouting coming from near a disused coppermine in woods above the Bridge of Allan, Stirlingshire.

Police sent a specialist dog handler and a team of officers to investigate while mountain rescue teams were also called in.

Search: A team of 20 police officers spent eight-and-a-half hours scouring woodland after a dog walker heard cries of 'help!' - which were actually from a woman shouting for her dog Yelp

Emergency search: Police were told within half an hour that a dog walker had been shouting at her pet in the area - but they carried on searching for a further eight hours anyway

Officers spent eight-and-a-half hours combing a small area of woodland yesterday searching for the 'trapped' woman.

But last night they were forced to call off their search after realising the cries were almost certainly a dog walker shouting the name of her pet.

Officers arrived on the scene at around 8am yesterday, and 'fairly quickly' established that another woman regularly 
exercised her dog in the area.

She was contacted at around 8.30 am, and confirmed that she had been in the area, and had indeed been shouting for her pet.

However, half an hour later, just as this
was beginning to look like the explanation, police received further 
calls from two more people, insisting they had again heard a woman's 
voice shouting 'help'.

Police eventually abandoned the search shortly after 5pm last night after finding no evidence of an emergency.

Hunt: The search went on in in woods above the Bridge of Allan, Stirlingshire, yesterday

A police spokesman said they were confident they had carefully searched the area, and had done all that could be done.

Inspector Pat Scroggie, who led the operation, said the search had been treated as 'precautionary'.

He said: 'We had teams search the hills accompanied with search dogs.

'We are very well versed in this type of thing. We are carried out systematic searches of all sections of the hill.'

The Bridge of Allan coppermine was used intermittently from the 16th century until the early part of the 20th century.

Probe: Three separate members of the public told police they thought they had heard cries of 'help!' yesterday

At one time, copper from the mine was used in the mint at Stirling Castle. No actual shafts exist, because the copper was extracted by drift mining techniques.

The area above Mine Woods, Bridge of Allan, was the focus of extensive searches earlier in the year, after Stirling University mathematics student David O'Halloran, 18, went missing in January.

His body was found in the spring, in open countryside, not far from the woods.

Hamish McArthur, 63, who lives on the hill, said: 'I think perhaps people are more wary now when they hear things after the young student was found in the field not far from here.'
