Shocked onlookers watched in horror as a jumper plunged 876ft after his parachute failed to open properly.

Christopher Brewer, 27, miraculously survived despite hitting the water at between 60 and 80mph in Fayetteville, West Virginia.

The BASE jumper's wingsuit, designed to allow him to glide forward instead of dropping straight down, probably slowed his fall and saved his life.

Jump: Onlookers watched in horror as jumper Christopher Brewer, 27, plunged 876ft after his parachute failed to open properly in Fayetteville, West Virginia

Mr Brewer, from Pensacola, Florida, suffered a pelvic fracture, lung injuries and a spine injury, Jeff West, chief ranger for New River Gorge National River, told the Register-Herald.

The death-defying drop - caught on video - happened at the annual Bridge Day celebration in Fayetteville.

The event drew more than 100,000 visitors on Saturday, including 400 BASE jumpers.

BASE stands for Bridge, Antenna, Span, Earth. Jumpers relish risking their lives with a relatively short amount of time for their parachutes to open.

Hitting the water: Brewer was still conscious when rescue teams rushed to his aid and he was airlifted in critical condition to the Charleston Area Medical Center

Bridge Day is the only time of the year the extreme sports enthusiasts can legally jump from the steel arch New River Gorge Bridge.

Mr Brewer was still conscious when rescue teams rushed to his aid and he was airlifted in critical condition to the Charleston Area Medical Center.

He was said to be in stable condition in hospital last night.

There were several other mishaps, including another jumper who was seriously injured when his leap went awry.
