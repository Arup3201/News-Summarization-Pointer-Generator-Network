It was the worst ordeal of her life.

Warned by doctors that she was most likely suffering from the life-threatening condition preeclampsia, Kim Kardashian was forced to deal with going into premature labour on Friday night to save the life of her baby girl.

With her 'blood pressure skyrocketing' and 'the baby in distress' according to Us Weekly, the pampered doyenne of reality TV was forced to grit her teeth and get on with the delivery.

And the 32-year-old was so brave in 
dealing with the terrifying ordeal that her often absent beau, Kanye 
West, 36, is now desperate to marry her as soon as possible.

'They'll start planning their next project, a wedding, sooner rather than later,' a source told People.

'He definitely wants to marry her, he hasn't left her side.'

And Kim's troubles aren't over, as Radar Online are reporting that she's having trouble breast-feeding, they write: 'Kim is doing it but seems like she’s having trouble.'

'She is planning to keep trying do it for a little while longer but she may end up switching to a bottle.'

Kim's friend Robin Antin, with whom 
she spent the last few days of her pregnancy relaxing in the sunshine, 
offered an insight into how Kim's stoic and tenacious behaviour this 
weekend impressed the often lugubrious rapper.

'This was a lot to go through,' the founder of music group GRL told the magazine.

'This was a lot to go through,' the founder of music group GRL told the magazine.

'I'm sure she was exhausted but she handled it like a pro.'

'Kim was scared but Kanye was more nervous,' Us Weekly reported.

'He asked a lot of questions as he paced about, they were both quite quiet.'

But Kim isn't quite out of the woods 
yet, doctors have warned the beauty - who is desperate to start 
exercising in order to get her body back into shape - that she needs to 
watch her blood pressure as hypertension can be a real issue after these
kinds of emergencies.

A source told Us: 'After discharge she should follow up with blood pressure checks. The condition can cause problems after birth.'

However, Kanye will be by Kim's side 
constantly from now on to monitor the health of his partner and their 
baby: 'For the next two weeks, Kim wants Kanye around 24/7,' the mole 
continued.

The couple will also employ the 
services of a nurse for a year, according to Us who report that the 
helper will wear 'a custom-made black-and-white uniform.'

'Kim is a bit freaked out, but the baby's breathing is fine,' the magazine continued.

And if she's crying, she might just get sampled on one of her daddy's new tracks as Kanye has been 'really inspired by the birth,; an insider shares told Life & Style, adding: 'He's written four songs already.'

West made sure he was front and centre for the birth of his first child.

So close: Last week she was spotted out to lunch with friends in Studio City

The rapper had been scheduled to make
an appearance at a release party in Los Angeles for his new album 
Yeezus, which is due out on Tuesday.

But Kim had started feeling ill 
Friday and, after having contractions, admitted herself to Cedars-Sinai 
Medical Center near Bevely Hills five weeks ahead of her scheduled due 
date, causing Kanye to skip out on his own party.

Several of Kim's close friends, 
including Scott Disick and Jonathan Cheban both attended the event and 
sources said that there were whispers around the room that Kim had 
already gone into labour by the time the party started.

According
to sources the Stronger songwriter stayed by Kim's side through the 
ordeal and refused to leave her side even as she went into full labour 
- five weeks early - and had a natural birth at 1:30 a.m. on Saturday 
morning.

'Of course, Kanye was there with Kim when she went to the hospital and had the baby,' Us Weekly reported, saying that he 'wouldn't have missed the arrival of the couple's bundle of joy for anything.'

Only days earlier the two had been fielding rumours that Kanye had strayed from their relationship.

Canadian model Leyla Ghobadi, 24, 
told Star Magazine that she and the rapper had a fling last July that 
continued for several months, but reps for both Kim and Kanye vigorously
deny the claims.

While the rapper is undoubtedly happy
to be celebrating his first Father's Day, the focus on his latest album
Yeezus prevented the duo from spending much time together.

The couple announced the pregnancy in December and shortly thereafter Kanye sought refuge in France to begin recording.

Kanye and Kim had been dating for eight months at that point, but have been friends for a number of years.

Their lack of time together in recent weeks made headlines, with the couple's last outing together in mid-May.

But
Kanye was seen making a brief appearance at Kim's baby shower, which 
was filmed for her reality show, at the beginning of the month.

In a lengthy interview he gave to the
New York Times to promote his forthcoming album, Kanye spoke about his 
reasons for not participating in Keeping In The Kardashians, his love 
for Kim and becoming a father.

He said: 'I’m the type of rock star 
that likes to have a girlfriend, you know? I’m the type of soul that 
likes to be in love and likes to be able to focus. And that inspires 
me.'

'You know, the 
amount of backlash I got from it is when I decided to not be on the show
anymore. And it’s not that I have an issue with the show; I just have 
an issue with the amount of backlash that I get. Because I just see 
like, an amazing person that I’m in love with that I want to help.'
