The ‘Peru Two’ drug mules are facing a fresh setback to their hopes of a transfer back to the UK after being unexpectedly moved to a remote prison hours outside of Lima in the middle of the desert.

Melissa Reid and Michaella McCollum Connolly, who are serving a seven-year jail term after being caught smuggling £1.5 million worth of cocaine, have been clinging to hopes that they might be sent home to serve the remainder of their sentences.

But the pair, who until now have been housed in Lima’s all-female Virgen de Fatima prison, were bussed out to Ancon 2, where prostitution and drug-taking is rife, on Thursday.

In another blow, the women also face the prospect of being separated for the first time since their arrest and kept in different cells.

The move will dampen hopes that the drug mules, both 20, will be transferred back to the UK anytime in the near future, with authorities making no official comment on the ongoing negotiations.

Last night Melissa Reid’s father, Billy, 54, told The Mail on Sunday: ‘This has come as a real shock. It’s a really worrying time for the family, we’re still waiting to hear something from Melissa.

‘Even if you were moved, you’d still think you’d be allowed a phone call back home to your family to tell them you’re OK. We haven’t heard anything since Wednesday.

‘I got the feeling that the girls had integrated quite well at Virgen de Fatima but the situation they’re in now they’ll have to do that all again. Until we hear from them it’s difficult now how they’re doing. I just hope they’re OK.’

The Scottish Prison Service confirmed last month that they have received ‘a repatriation application’ from Peru for Melissa and it is understood Belfast-born Michaella has made a similar application.

But Melissa’s family, from Lenzies, near Glasgow, have yet to receive any update on the application and are now coming to terms with the fact that it may be a lengthy wait.

‘We were a bit swept up in a wave of emotion thinking the transfer might happen fairly quickly but I think I’m back to reality in realising that it won’t happen as soon as we hoped. It’s like a rollercoaster at the moment – really up and down,’ Mr Reid said.

Ancon is a mixed prison complex housing almost 3,000 inmates, of which around 325 are foreign, more than 100 of them women and most of whom are there on drug charges. It can take almost three hours from the capital to reach its remote location north of Lima.

Janet, a British woman who visited her partner in Ancon last year, gave a first-hand insight into the harsh conditions at the prison in the Prisoners Abroad newsletter.

She wrote: ‘There is a tension within the walls, almost a vacuum, and a timeless void. The nature of the design is to segregate and wear down the spirit.

‘Every surface inside is a seamless shade of grey, even the food served to them is a cold grey mush.

'It feels like the monotony and boredom sucks the life out of the men. You can feel their shame as they hang their heads and shuffle by chain by their hands and feet.’

Chloé Constant, a French academic specialising in female prisons in Peru who has interviewed more than 100 inmates, told The Mail on Sunday: ‘It’s a modern purpose-built prison in the middle of the desert and they seem to be shipping all the foreign prisoners out there.

‘There are no trees or grass. The biggest problem is that it’s in the middle of the desert, so the water sometimes doesn’t work and phone lines cut out. Last time I visited there, the women were complaining that there were insects in the food - it’s not very nice.’

The women were each jailed for six years and eight months in December after trying to smuggle £1.5million worth of cocaine out of Peru in their suitcases at Lima International Airport last August.

This month The Mail on Sunday revealed how One Direction’s tour manager paid the drug mules a surprise visit, bringing them KFC and chocolate Easter eggs.
