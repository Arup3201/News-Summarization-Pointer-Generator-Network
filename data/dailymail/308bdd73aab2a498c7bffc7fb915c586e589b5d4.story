Tragedy: Daniela Ruggiero, 18, and a 17-year-old girl yet to be named died in the accident

A talented dancer was killed when her car exploded after she hit a deer on a  country road.

Daniela Ruggiero, 18, who only passed her driving test in January, was travelling with a female friend when the animal ran in front of them.

As she fought to control her yellow Citroen C1 it veered across the road, struck a Volvo and burst into flames, leaving Daniela and her 17-year-old friend trapped in the inferno.

The identity of the second girl has yet to be formally released because not all of her relatives have been informed.

Last night, friends and family paid tribute to the ‘beautiful and talented’ girls as they tried to come to terms with the shock of the sudden deaths.

Miss Ruggiero, who was training to be a dance teacher at a college in Royston, Hertfordshire, had spoken to friends of her excitement at passing her test earlier this year and tweeted pictures of herself and her new three-door car.

The accident happened on the rural A10 in nearby Puckeridge.

The Volvo driver, a man in his fifties, suffered leg injuries as he desperately tried to rescue the girls from their burning car.

He was later taken to hospital for treatment. Emergency services teams recovered the bodies from the wreckage.

Yesterday, friends spoke of their shock at what had happened after gathering to pay their respects at Miss Ruggiero’s family home in Hoddesdon, Hertfordshire.

One relative said the family were ‘all very distraught’. A woman who asked not to be named said: ‘It is terrible. It is so sad. She was a lovely girl.’

Best friend Bethany Trower paid tribute to Miss Ruggiero online, writing on Twitter: ‘RIP to my beautiful talented best friend who will be missed by so many.’ 

Kerrie Crockford said: ‘Daniela you were an amazing dancer and person. My thoughts are with your family and friends.’
