Despite a vast security clampdown, riot police and army units allowed the peaceful crowds to vent their anger in the biggest rallies the country has seen since the fall of the USSR. 

As many as 50,000 massed at Moscow’s Bolotnaya Square near the Kremlin.

It followed demonstrations in 70 cities 
across the country - many held in freezing snow, where campaigners 
screamed 'Putin's a louse' and demanded he quit - including Siberia and 
the Far East.

Last night, protesters issued an 
ultimatum to Prime Minister Putin to cancel ‘fraudulent’ parliamentary 
elections and stage a rerun – or face an even larger mass protest in two
 weeks.

The authorities deployed more than 
50,000 police and soldiers for yesterday’s rallies but there was no 
repeat of the arrests at smaller spontaneous protests earlier last week.

Armoured vehicles blocked access to 
Red Square and government buildings around the Kremlin and tiny spy 
helicopters monitored the crowds. 

Authoritarian former KGB spy Putin – 
who plans to return to the Kremlin as president in March – now faces his
 most acute political crisis since coming to power.

Yesterday, he kept a low profile, 
monitoring the extraordinary scenes from his official residence near 
Moscow. Last night his spokesman said: ‘The government cannot yet 
formulate its attitude to the many thousands meeting  at Bolotnaya.’ 

There were even calls from the crowd 
for Putin to be jailed over the ‘rigged’ parliamentary poll, which  his 
United Russia party narrowly won last week, and the endemic corruption 
which is rampant at all levels throughout the country.

Independent observers suggest United 
Russia’s vote was inflated from about  25 per cent to 50 per cent of the
 total share, enough to give an overall majority.

Exact estimates on the size of yesterday’s protest varied but there was agreement it is the largest Putin has seen.

‘Maybe 100,000 people were at this 
rally,’ declared Mikhail Kasyanov, Putin’s first prime minister but now a
 bitter enemy. ‘Today is the beginning of the end for these thieving 
authorities.’

And ex-deputy premier Boris Nemtsov, 
briefly jailed for taking part in an earlier protest, said: ‘The current
 regime does not know how to behave with dignity. All they know is 
cynicism.’

Leading Russian novelist Boris Akunin
 said: ‘I haven’t seen such things for 20 years, since 1991. There’s no 
way back from events such as these. Our city has changed.’ 

As the protests unfolded, the 
websites of Russia’s two major state-run channels ignored developments 
in an act of Soviet-style censorship.

In London, protesters chanted slogans 
and displayed banners outside the Houses of Parliament. And Moscow rally
 organiser, opposition politician Vladimir Ryzhkov, has announced there 
will be another protest on December 24, which he says will be twice as 
large.

The protests come three months before
 Putin, who was president from 2000 to 2008 and effectively remained the
 country's leader while prime minister, is to seek a third term in 
office.

The public outpouring challenges his 
image, supported by state-controlled TV channels, as a man who won the 
affection of most Russians.

That image was undercut by last 
Sunday's parliamentary elections, during which his United Party narrowly
 retained a majority of seats.

Ex-pat protest: Russians gathered outside the Houses of Parliament in London to also rally against what they think was a fraudulent election process

But it lost the unassailable 
two-thirds majority it held in the previous parliament.  Even that 
reduced performance was unearned, inflated by massive vote fraud, the 
opposition says, citing reports by local and international monitors of 
widespread violations.

The reports of vote-rigging and the party's loss of seats acted as a catalyst for long-simmering discontent of many Russians.

'The falsifications that authorities 
are doing today have turned the country into a big theater, with clowns 
like in a circus,' said Alexander Trofimov, one of the early arrivals 
for the protest at Bolotnaya Square, on an island in the Moscow River 
adjacent to the Kremlin.

Opposition: Protesters took to the streets of Russia's far eastern city of Vladivostok today to show their anger against the alleged rigged elections

Anger: One of the first protests of the day took part in Vladivostok

Claims: Crowds gathered in Vladivostok to protest against the ruling United Russia party

'I don't think any citizen of the 
country can say he is very happy with anything. We don't have an 
independent judiciary, there is no freedom of expression - all this 
combined creates a situation where people are forced to protest,' said 
demonstrator Albert Yusupov, who was dressed in civilian clothes but 
identified himself as a member of the Russian army.

By the time the rally started, the 
square and adjacent streets were packed shoulder-to-shoulder with 
protesters braving intermittent wind-blown snow.

City authorities have given 
permission for a rally of up to 30,000 people, unusual largesse for an 
opposition that generally is either denied permission to rally or 
limited to small numbers.

It was not clear if police would 
choose to crack down if the crowd clearly exceeded 30,000. But they did 
try to move demonstrators off a footbridge leading to the island, 
claiming it was so packed with people that it could collapse.

Protests took place in at least 15 other cities from the Pacific Coast to the southwest.

In the Pacific city of Vladivostok, 
several hundred protesters rallied along a waterside avenue where some 
of Russia's Pacific Fleet warships are docked. They shouted 'Putin's a 
louse' and some held a banner caricaturing United Russia's emblem, 
reading 'The rats must go'.

And in the eastern city of St Petersburg, observers said more than 10,000 took to the streets.

Police stayed on the fringes of that 
demonstration and made no arrests. But the Interfax news agency reported
 that about 15 people were arrested at a protest in the Siberian city of
 Perm and about 30 in the Far Eastern city of Khabarovsk when a 
flash-mob started an unauthorized protest.

Officials in many cities, including 
Moscow, gave permission for the protests. But in what appeared to be an 
attempt to prevent young people from attending the protest, Moscow's 
school system declared Saturday afternoon a mandatory extra school day 
for grades 9-11. Students were told of the decision only on Friday, news
 reports said.

Hundreds of people, were arrested in 
smaller protests earlier in the week. Some, including prominent 
opposition blogger Alexei Navalny, were sentenced to 15 days in jail.

Another prominent opposition figure, 
Sergei Udaltsov, was hospitalized after his Monday arrest and was 
expected to be released Saturday, but the Interfax news agency said he 
was taken from the hospital to a court to face further charges.

President Dmitry Medvedev conceded this week that election law may have been violated and Putin suggested 'dialogue with the opposition-minded' - breaking from his usual authoritarian image.

The Kremlin has come under strong international pressure, with U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton calling the vote unfair and urging an investigation into fraud.

The opposition predicts at least 30,000 demonstrators will assemble for the Moscow protest. If today's protests are a success, the activists then face the challenge of long-term strategy.

Even though U.S. Sen. John McCain recently tweeted to Putin that 'the Arab Spring is coming to a neighborhood near you', things in Russia are not that simple.

The popular uprisings that brought down governments in Georgia in 2003, in Ukraine the next year and in Egypt last spring all were significantly boosted by demonstrators being able to establish round-the-clock presences, notably in Cairo's Tahrir Square and the massive tent camp on Kiev's main avenue.

Russian police would hardly tolerate anything similar. In Ukraine and Georgia, police were low-profile, staying on the edges of the protests and keeping their numbers small.

It is seen as a far cry from Russian police's usual crowd-controlling method of flooding any protest zone with hundreds of helmeted police who seem to relish violence.

Opposition figures indicated today that the next step would be to call another protest in Moscow for next weekend, with the aim of making it even bigger. But staged events at regular intervals may be less effective than daily spontaneous protests.

The opposition is also vulnerable to attacks on the websites and social media that have nourished the protests. This week, an official of Vkontakte, a Russian social networking site, reported pressure from the FSB, the KGB's main successor, to block access to opposition groups, but said his company refused.

On election day, the websites of a main independent radio station and the country's only independent election-monitoring group fell victim to denial-of-service hacker attacks.
