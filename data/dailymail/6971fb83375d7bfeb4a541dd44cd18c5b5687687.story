A 12th century manor house which comes complete with a secret passageway and was once home to an English aristocrat and heiress has gone on the market for £4.25million.

The grade II listed 11-bedroom property in St Albans, Hertfordshire, was once the home of Lady Katherine Ferrers – also known as the ‘Wicked Lady’ – who led a secret life as a highwaywoman.   

The stately home, which dates back to a monk from St Albans who formed a hermitage in the early 1100s, still has many of its original features, including a Jacobean oak staircase and stone Tudor fireplace.

The 11-bedroom property in St Albans, Hertfordshire, was once the home of Lady Ferrers - also known as the 'Wicked Lady' - who led a secret life as a highwaywoman

However, it’s most intriguing feature is a secret passageway behind the fireplace which leads into a secret chamber.

It is rumoured that - bored by her husband, Sir Thomas Fanshaw, Lady Katherine would climb down through the hidden partition at night and creep down secret stairs in the chamber which led out onto the grounds.

She is then said to have donned breeches, a cloak, mask and tricorn hat before climing onto a black horse, which would be waiting for her.

After setting off for Watling Street, which is now the busy A5 which runs past the house on its way north from London, she would carry out midnight robberies on unsuspecting travellers.

The tale of ‘Wicked Lady Ferrers’ - as she ultimately became known – is so intriguing it has even been the subject of two films and a novel.

The property, which is set in the heart of the estate's 79 acres of land, has been passed on to an array of different families throughout the generations but is now up for sale with Savills Estate Agents for £4.25m

The property, which is set in the heart of the estate’s 79 acres of land, has since been passed on to an array of different families throughout the generations.

Now named Cell Park, after formerly being known as Markyate Cell, the estate comes complete with the main home, a separate attached annex, two detached cottages and various outbuildings.

It is on the market with Savills Estate Agents with a guide price of £4.25million, although offers of £4million are being considered.

Julian David, an associate at Savills, said: ‘It’s a lasting piece of British architecture. It’s steeped in so much history.

'It’s a fabulous piece of English architecture and there’s a lot of history surrounding it.

‘It’s set in fabulous grounds and is ideal for someone who wants something quintessentially British.’

The property was in the ownership of the Ferrers family for several decades until the death of its most famous inhabitant Katherine - The Wicked Lady - Ferrers (above)

Cell Park mansion, formerly known as Markyate Cell, was built in the early 1100s by a monk from St Albans, Hertfordshire, who formed a hermitage at the mansion.

In 1145, Abbot Geoffrey, also of St Albans, took over the estate when he founded a Benedictine priory at the property.

Markyate Cell remained a priory for the next four centuries until confiscated by the Crown in the Dissolution of the Monasteries in 1536.

In 1539, a 21-year lease was granted to Humphrey Bourchier, who converted the monastery into a stately manor house. Many of the original features from this era, including a Jacobean oak staircase and stone Tudor fireplaces, still remain.

In 1547, Edward VI granted the estate to George Ferrers, Lord of the Manor of Flamstead, and the property remained in the ownership of the Ferrers family until the death of its most famous inhabitant Katherine - The Wicked Lady – Ferrers.

It was rumoured that Katherine would leave the house in the guise of a highwayman and rob passengers on Watling Street (now the A5).

According to popular legend, Lady Katherine committed highway robberies with her accomplice and purported lover, Ralph Chaplin. She also stole from her husband Sir Thomas Fanshaw’s dinner guests by using a secret passageway at the property – which remains hidden behind the Tudor fireplace to this day.

In 1660, aged just 26, Lady Katherine died. Although the circumstances surrounding her death have never been confirmed, it is widely thought she was shot during one of her robberies on Nomansland Common in Wheathamstead.

As the legend goes, she died of her wounds while trying to ride back to the secret staircase entry at Markyate Cell. Her body was supposedly discovered wearing men's clothing before her servants recovered it and carried her home to be buried.

Following her death, Thomas Coppin then purchased Cell Park and it remained in his family until 1805 when it was sold to Joseph Howell.

On his death in 1825, Daniel Goodson Adey bought the property and Markyate Cell stayed in his family until 1910. Under his ownership, the house was largely rebuilt in 1825-6 by Robert Lugar to incorporate the remains of the mansion built in 1539-40 and the original priory of 1145.

In 1910, the new owner, Mr MacLeod, set about redesigning the gardens and a major part of this design remains today.

In 1916, the estate passed into the hands of Sir Thomas Beecham and two years later it was sold to Sir John Pennefather.

Since Pennefather's ownership in 1918, it has had a number of different occupants and in 1984 it became known as Cell Park.
