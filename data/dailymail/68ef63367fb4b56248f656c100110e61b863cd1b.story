Popular: Rosie Whitaker, who once performed at London's Royal Opera House, was a 'popular, beautiful girl who brought joy to everyone through her various talents'

A girl of 15 killed herself by lying in front of a train after visiting websites which promote self-harm and suicide, an inquest heard yesterday.

Rosie Whitaker, a talented ballet dancer who had performed at the Royal Opera House, suffered from bulimia.

The inquest was told she had been a happy girl leading a full and normal life until the beginning of the year.

She had become stressed by the ten GCSEs she was taking which exacerbated her eating disorder.

She had admitted to her mother that she had self-harmed and had visited self-harming websites before her death in June close to her home in Beckenham, south-east London.

Campaigners are calling for the Government to act to prevent the vulnerable being influenced by such websites after a second 15-year-old girl died in similar circumstances last month.

Tallulah Wilson, who had said she was a friend of Rosie’s, was hit by a train at St Pancras station in London after visiting a website about self-harm and anorexia.

Rosie’s mother, Vanja Whitaker, said in a statement read to her inquest in Croydon: ‘She was a perfectionist, very particular about her school work. Rosie made those around her laugh. She didn’t judge anybody.

‘She cared for people, and was leaning towards a career as a social worker or in psychology.’

She said her daughter had been referred to the adolescent specialist anorexia unit at King’s College Hospital in south London.

Tributes: Friends of Rosie left flowers and notes at Beckenham Station in tribute to the schoolgirl

You'll never be forgotten: One of Rosie's friends left a note expressing her sadness at the schoolgirl's death

She said: ‘She was treated for her eating disorder, but I thought that rather missed the point. She was still self-harming.

Train driver Andrew Pagram said he saw
a shadow drop on to the tracks but thought it was a plastic bag or a 
piece of discarded advertising, so did not immediately brake.

'She was two to three seconds away. I broke as soon as I realised what had happened'.

Rosie's dancing achievements had included performing at London's prestigious Royal Opera House

After her death, Rosie’s family 
said in a statement in June: It appears she was, unfortunately, heavily 
influenced by websites and online communities promoting self-harm and 
suicide.

‘We hope her tragic death serves as a 
warning to other impressionable youngsters and their parents that such 
sites pose grave risks.’

Coroner Dr Roy Palmer recorded a verdict of suicide.
