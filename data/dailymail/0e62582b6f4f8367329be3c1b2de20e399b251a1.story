Manchester United manager Louis van Gaal has told outspoken Old Trafford legends Gary Neville and Paul Scholes they know nothing about what is happening at their former club.

Van Gaal takes his team’s five-game winning run into Sunday lunchtime’s home game with Liverpool in the Barclays Premier League with Neville claiming United are defending like a pub team and Scholes saying he fears the best young talent in the North West will now head to Manchester City’s new £200million training complex.

But United manager Van Gaal, who hit back at Neville in the week, said in response to Scholes on Friday: ‘That’s another legend, yeah? I think he has to pay attention to his words too. The building and accommodation (at the training ground) is not so important.

‘The philosophy and staff are, and then you have to work with the talents.

‘I don’t have time to compare talents and staff (with City) but when I see what we have I am very happy.’

Neville said after United won at Southampton that Friday’s game would be like watching the ‘Dog and Duck versus the Red Lion’.

Former United assistant boss Mike Phelan has also been critical, suggesting that the club’s injury record may be down to training methods.

Van Gaal dismissed the remarks: ‘I analyse everything but if this talk is based on no facts then I say "No".’

United’s injury list is down to four, with Chris Smalling, Angel di Maria, Daley Blind and Luke Shaw out. Phil Jones and Rafael da Silva are training but not match-ready.
