Lawyers for the captain of the capsized Costa Concordia have made a last-ditch appeal, asking the Italian court trying him for the 2012 shipwreck to consider errors of other crew, not just his conduct.

The court in Grosseto will soon deliberate the fate of Francesco Schettino, who is charged with manslaughter in the deaths of 32 people, abandoning ship before all of the 4,200 passengers and crew were evacuated, and causing the shipwreck.

The Concordia smashed into a reef when sailing too close to Giglio Island, causing the vessel the capsize. Schettino's lawyers have denied that their client acted like a 'reckless idiot'.

Survivors have previously spoken of their shock of seeing the skipper - who has been dubbed 'Captain Coward' - standing on the shore after the disaster without even getting his feet wet.

Plea: Lawyers for Francesco Schettino (pictured arriving in Grosseto this morning) have made a last-ditch appeal for the court trying him for the 2012 shipwreck to consider errors of other crew, not just his conduct

Awaiting his fate: Schettino is pictured arriving at the courthouse in Grosseto, Tuscany this morning

Claim: The Concordia smashed into a reef when sailing too close to Giglio Island. Lawyers for Francesco Schettino (pictured in court earlier in the trial) have denied that their client acted like a 'reckless idiot'

This morning lawyer Donato Laino says prosecutors built their case 'around one person, not the facts', adding that Mr Schettino believes he is being made a scapegoat for wider failings.

Schettino faces up to 26 years in prison on charges of causing the shipwreck, with the Grosseto court handing potentially down a verdict as early as this evening.

Investigators have severely criticised his handling of the disaster, accusing him of bringing the 290 metre-long vessel too close to shore when it struck rocks off the Tuscan island of Giglio, tearing a hole in its side and setting off a chaotic night evacuation of more than 4,000 passengers and crew. 

He has also been accused of delaying evacuation and losing control of the operation during which he abandoned ship before all the 4,200 passengers and crew had been rescued.

Prosecutors have asked for a sentence of 26 years in prison for Schettino, who has admitted some responsibility as captain of the ship but denies blame for deaths that occurred during evacuation.

This morning he was left alone in the dock to answer for the disaster after the ship's owners Costa Cruises, a unit of Carnival Corp, paid a €1 million fine to settle. 

Prosecutors also accepted plea bargains from five other officials, none of whom were jailed.

Disaster: The wreck of the Costa Concordia lying on its side after it smashed into a reef near Giglio Island, with 32 people on board losing their lives

The Costa Concordia wreck was one of the highest-profile shipping disasters of recent years, leaving the massive hulk abandoned on its side for two-and-a-half years before it was towed away in the most expensive maritime wreck recovery in history.

Schettino's defence team argued he prevented an even worse disaster by steering the ship close to the island as it sank. They say the sentence sought by prosecutors goes beyond even sentences sought for mafia killers.

'I believe and hope that the court will be able to establish the fact that the deaths happened after the impact,' his lawyer Domenico Pepe told reporters.

Schettino, a distinctive figure with his sharp suits and pomaded hair, has been a constant presence throughout the trial in a makeshift courtroom set up in a theatre in Grosseto.

Questions have also been asked about the safety procedures and the wider responsibilities of ship operators Carnival.

Giuliano Leuzzi, a lawyer representing consumer organisation Codacons, a civil party in the case said: 'We need to establish the real responsibilities and each party should take responsibility for their share.'
