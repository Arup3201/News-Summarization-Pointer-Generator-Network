The family of Benefits Street star Fungi have turned their backs on him after it emerged he was sleeping rough, saying that he 'used up all his chances' and 'deserves everything he gets'.

Fungi, real name James Clarke, fled his home on the notorious James Turner Street in Winson Green, Birmingham, after the Channel 4 series aired last month.

TV producers had been paying for him to stay in a hotel in Wales, but stopped picking up the tab when the documentary ended.

He was seen in Cardiff begging passers-by for change, and claiming he had been 'exploited' by the makers of the documentary series, who 'made their money out of me'.

Fungi said that he had family but did not want to stay with them as it would be 'disrespectful'. But his 23-year-old daughter Kirsty today said he was banned even from seeing his three grandchildren.

She said: 'It might sound horrible but my dad has ruined his own life, my mum's life and mine.

'He deserves to be living on the streets. He blames everyone but himself for his problems. He has used up all his chances but he's still blaming people for his situation.

'Maybe being homeless will teach him, once and for all, to pull himself together and stop taking drugs and drinking his life away.'

Fungi launched the attack on Channel 4, and co-star White Dee, on Friday while begging outside a Tesco store in the Welsh city.

Fungi, an alcoholic, lived in a taxpayer-funded home on James Turner Street while the series was being filmed last year, but fled afterwards in a bid to beat his drink problem.

The TV station had been paying for him to stay in hotels around Wales while Benefits Street was broadcasting, but stopped picking up the bill after the last episode was shown.

Speaking to the Sun on Sunday, he said: 'I've been exploited, the people who run the show made their money out of me and f***** me off.

'I slept rough last night. I've got no house to go to now. I've got family up here but I couldn't stay with them - it would have been disrespectful.'

He also hit out at fellow star White Dee, who has made numerous television appearances since Benefits Street was broadcast, and is reportedly mulling over a Â£90,000 deal to appear on Celebrity Big Brother.

He said: 'That White Dee is earning money now and doesn't give a f***. I think she's a two-faced f*****.'

Ms Clarke was brought up single-handed by her mum Donna Reilly, 39, after she kicked Fungi out for his drug-taking.

She said: 'My mum was young when she met my dad. They stayed in touch but my dad was always going off with his druggie mates.

'My mum wanted him to be involved in my life but I hardly saw him because he was bad news.

'I was 12 years old and one of my cousins knocked at the door and told us he thought he'd seen my dad in town asleep.

'My mum took me down to town and we saw him curled up next to another tramp in the shop doorway.

'He's let me down my entire life. I haven't had one birthday or Christmas present from him and I'm embarrassed for my kids that they have him as a granddad.

'Benefits Street is the worst thing he has ever done and we have to live with that forever.'

Ms Reilly said: 'He hasn't changed at all. He's hooked on alcohol and whatever else and it'll probably end up killing him.

'He has sold his soul to Channel 4 and has wrecked any chance of having a relationship with his children or grandchildren.'

A spokesman for Channel 4 said 'Fungi decided to spend time away from James Turner Street. 

Since then the team from Love Productions have provided some support for him and are currently helping him find alternative accommodation should he prefer not to return to James Turner Street.

'In the meantime he assured us that he would be staying with relatives.'
