A Florida Walmart shopper has been arrested for using a device hidden in his shoe to photograph up women's skirts.

Paul Senzee, 40, was charged with video voyeurism after allegedly placing a device described in the arrest report as an iPhone or iPod inside his shoe where he had cut a strategic hole.

He then sidled up behind a woman and placed his foot underneath her to film up her skirt.

The alleged victim, Lillie Kent, told officers she was shopping for household items when she noticed a man 'standing relatively close behind her,' according to the arrest report published by The Smoking Gun.

When Kent turned around, Senzee quickly turned and walked away and focused on the merchandise.

She told police she noticed an odd hole in the top of Senzee's shoe at that time but thought nothing of it.

However, when Kent went to the checkout queue, Senzee again appeared behind her - but didn't have any items to purchase.

She told police that she turned around to look at Senzee and again noticed the hole in his shoe, at which point Senzee began walking away from her.

Kent followed him and blocked his path with her shopping cart, demanding to see his shoes.

Senzee refused and Kent began yelling, according to the arrest report.

An unknown man stoppped Senzee and the camera was pulled from his shoe.

Senzee's right shoe had a hole cut out of it to accommodate the device's camera, which was taped in place with black electrical tape.

According to the Orlando Sentinel, store security footage shows Senzee 'walk up behind [Kent] in the check-out line and extend his right foot under her skirt multiple times.'

Police will conduct a search of Senzee's cellphone to determine if there were any additional victims.

According to Senzee's Facebook page, he's a married father of several children.
