Roy Keane has a notorious reputation as one of football's toughest characters but Aston Villa boss Paul Lambert believes that isn't the case.

The pair are currently working together at Villa Park, with Keane hired as the Scot's assistant manager in July.

Keane's appointment was expected to bring an added sternness to Lambert's regime, but the 45-year-old says the Irishman has done the opposite - giving a boost to the club.

'He loves a laugh, he's not just serious,' Lambert told the Daily Star. 'It's been great for me and everyone else at the club. It's been good.

'I think he's given everybody a boost, he's given the whole club a good lift.

As a player Keane's no-nonsense outspoken nature saw him involved him in many on-field spats - most notably when he walked out on the Republic of Ireland's 2002 World Cup campaign.

Since hanging up his boots, the Manchester United legend has carried that over into his coaching career as well as TV punditry but Lambert insists there is a jovial side to his assistant.

'People probably see Roy as this - I don't know - a stern faced guy who doesn't really laugh,' he added.

'But when you get to know him he does like a good laugh.

'You've got to have that, you must have the difference from being serious to really kind of chilling out as such.'
