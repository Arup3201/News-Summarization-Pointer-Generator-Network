The burden of EU regulation  on the NHS and businesses will be laid bare today in the first official audit of the costs of Britain’s membership.

Officials have spent months collecting evidence on a comprehensive assessment of the extent of meddling from Brussels.

The first of their reports will be published tomorrow by William Hague, the Foreign Secretary, and senior Conservatives hope it will help their plans to try to renegotiate looser ties with the EU.

It comes amid alarming evidence that patient care is being put at risk by strict EU rules on working hours.

Doctors’ leaders have warned ministers that the working-time directive, an EU edict which limits the working week to 48 hours, is having a serious impact in the NHS. Hospitals have had to alter traditional shift patterns and hire huge numbers of agency workers to ensure staff do not break the rules.

The heads of the medical royal colleges suggest that thanks to the rules patients in hospital increasingly see a ‘conveyor belt’ of doctors at their bedside, while trainee doctors are unable to gain the hands-on experience they need.

Tory MPs are urging David Cameron to take action to pull Britain out of the working-time directive in a renegotiation ahead of a referendum on EU membership, which the Prime Minister has promised to hold by the end of 2017 if he remains at No 10.

The rules are also seen by many business leaders as uncompetitive when EU countries are up against booming economies such as India and China.

The analysis, ordered by Mr Cameron, is supposed to be a neutral, fact-finding exercise about Britain’s future in the EU.

The first report will look at how the EU and the single market affects UK taxation, health, business, overseas aid, foreign policy, animal welfare and food safety.

A further 26 reports will be  published in coming months.

Open Europe, the Eurosceptic think-tank, described the reports as a ‘useful exercise that will inform the EU debate for years to come’.

But Stephen Booth, one of its researchers, added: ‘Unless this review is complemented by a political strategy to set out the parameters of a future EU renegotiation, it will not be sufficient.’

The Prime Minister insisted other EU members know the UK is ready to leave unless it negotiates a better relationship, and that Britain now rejected the founding principle of the EU. ‘Ever closer union, something that’s in the Treaty of Rome, shouldn’t apply to the UK,’ he added. ‘We’ve never signed up to that, we’ve never liked that. Let’s get Britain out of that.’

The Prime Minister said that in recent months, other EU member states had agreed that reforms were necessary to allow some countries to have looser ties, including Germany, Sweden, Holland and Italy.
