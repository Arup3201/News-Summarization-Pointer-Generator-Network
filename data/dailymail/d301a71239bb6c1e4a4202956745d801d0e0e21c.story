Chelsea Handler had an in-person meeting with Bill Cosby where she believed she narrowly avoided being victimized.

Speaking with Esquire magazine alongside Nick Offerman, the comedian and author described being freaked out by an invitation to Cosby's hotel suite and bringing three male friends for support.

'I was in Atlantic City playing, doing stand-up,' Handler said. 'And he was doing stand-up in Atlantic City in the same hotel.'

A near Cosby: Speaking with Esquire magazine, Chelsea Handler described being invited to Cosby's hotel suite and bringing three male friends

'At like three o’clock in the afternoon, someone from the hotel came down and said, "Oh, you know, Mr. Cosby would really like to meet you up in his hotel suite."'

'I thought, "That’s really weird,"' she continued. 'I don't want to go alone.'

Handler says that three guys who were with her on the trip filming accompanied her up to Cosby's suite and the meeting passed without incident.

The story followed a comment by writer Scott Raab expressing sympathy for the comedian who has faced a long line of women alleging he drugged and sexually assaulted them.

'Not poor guy—he tried to Cosby me,' Handler exclaimed. 

She claimed even after stories of decades of assault came to light, she didn't put her own experience in that context until a friend reminded her.

Backup: Handler said she brought three friends because she felt uncomfortable, one of whom reminded her of the incident years later as accusations began pouring in

'I forgot about it when all the stories about Bill Cosby came out,' Handler said. 'I didn’t even think of it.'

'Then my friend texted me the other day saying, “Do you remember that night we went up to, or that afternoon we went up to Bill Cosby’s and you were so freaked out you made us come with you?”'

'He said, "Hello! You could’ve been one of his victims if we weren’t there."' 

'He’s guilty,' Handler concluded. 'I think it’s pretty obvious now.'
