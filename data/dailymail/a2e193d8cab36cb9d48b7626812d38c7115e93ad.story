Two prison guards had to be taken to hospital after they were attacked by an inmate at Pentonville Prison in North London.

The two guards were attacked after an inmate was not allowed a second helping of food, it has been reported.

The incident came just two days after a report warned of 'realistic concerns' that spending cuts would threaten the safety of staff and inmates at the prison.

In the attack on Thursday a male officer was punched in the face by an inmate, The Mirror has reported.

A female officer was thrown against a wall by a second inmate when she tried to intervene.

According to the paper, both of them were taken to hospital with cuts and bruises.

Scotland Yard has said it is investigating the incident.

A Prison Service spokesman told 
MailOnline: 'Two members of staff from HMP Pentonville were treated in 
hospital following an incident involving two prisoners on August 15. 
This incident has been referred to the police.

'Pentonville has a zero tolerance to 
violence. Any prisoners engaging in violent behaviours will be stripped 
of their privileges and are subject to disciplinary action.'

Steve Gillan, the Prison Officers Association's national secretary, told The Mirror there had been a rise in such attacks, which the association believed was due to Government cuts.

But last month Justice Minister Jeremy Wright said the assault rate in prisons had fallen over the last five years and was at its lowest since 2004.

He said: 'We have a zero tolerance approach to violence in all our prisons.

'We have systems in place to deal with perpetrators quickly and robustly, with serious incidents referred to the police for prosecution.

'The prison assault rate has fallen over the last five years and the current rate of assaults is the lowest since 2004.

'We are committed to open and transparent reporting of data relating to deaths in custody, self-harm and assaults. It remains a priority to reduce the number of deaths and violence in custody. Prisons take the responsibility of keeping prisoners, staff and visitors safe extremely seriously.'

A report by Pentonville Prison's independent monitoring board last week warned conditions at the prison remained unsatisfactory, The Evening Standard reported.

The report said: 'The physical environment of this prison is a reproach to 21st-century Britain.'

In June last year one of Britain's longest serving murderers John Massey escaped from the prison.

He was arrested two days later following an 'intelligence-led operation, the Metropolitan Police said.

Massey, who had broken out of jail twice before, accomplished his most dramatic escape using a makeshift rope to scale the walls of the Victorian-built prison.

Last week's report said the escape was one of a number of problems the prison faced, although there had also been 'many positives' during the previous 12 months.
