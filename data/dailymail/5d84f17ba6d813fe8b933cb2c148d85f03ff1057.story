Non!: French railway's new 'politeness police' will be able to fine passengers for antisocial behaviour, such as putting their feet on seats

France's state-owned railways are hiring hundreds of 'politeness police' to clamp down on bad manners on the nation's trains.

The new employees will be 'conflict specialists' sent in to tackle mounting numbers of rude or unruly passengers.

The main gripes of travellers included smoking on board, putting feet on seats, speaking loudly on mobile phones, playing music, swearing and amorous couples being 'too affectionate' with each other, a spokesman for the SNCF rail operator said.

He added: 'We aim to tackle offensive or irritating everyday behaviour of certain people who make life a misery for other passengers and train employees.

'In certain cases our agents will be able to hand out fines, for smoking, putting feet on seats or damaging property.

'In other cases they will engage people in a conversation about simply having respect for their fellow passengers.'

The scheme comes after a French mayor also brought in regulations to force people to be polite to each other in his town hall.

Mayor Gerard Plee put up a notice warning that anyone who fails to say 'please' and 'thank you' to his staff or say 'hello' and 'goodbye' would be ejected from the building.

He said he hoped the measure would improve 'social standards' in the village of Lheraule, northern France, which has just 185 residents.

He added: 'A smile costs nothing and and in the case of manifest failure to comply voluntarily with these norms the person concerned will be requested to leave the premises.'
