Former Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert smiles as he waits in a court room in Jerusalem's District Court. He was convicted of illicitly receiving money, fraud and breach of trust

Former Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert has been convicted  of unlawfully accepting money from a U.S. supporter in a retrial of corruption charges.

The 69-year-old accepted around £104,000 ($153,950) from Morris Talansky while he was a cabinet minister, Jerusalem District Court heard.

He could now be given five years in prison - in addition to a six-year sentence he received in 2014 for a separate bribery conviction. His lawyers said they are likely to appeal the latest ruling.

Following the verdict Uri Korev, prosecuting, said: 'His behaviour constitutes a breach of trust which harms the public, harms morality and harms the public's trust in how he behaved corruptly.'

Olmert gave former office manager Shula Zaken part of the money in exchange for loyalty as well as using some for personal use without reporting it, the judges concluded.

He was convicted of illicitly receiving money, fraud and breach of trust.

Eyal Rozovsky, Olmert's lawyer, said their legal team was 'of course very disappointed' by the ruling.

Olmert resigned in early 2009 amid corruption allegations. 

He was originally acquitted in 2012 of a series of charges including accepting cash-stuffed envelopes from Talansky while he was mayor of Jerusalem. 

He received around £406,000 ($600,000) from the U.S. businessman but there was no evidence the money had been used for unlawful person reasons or illegal campaign financing, the court said.

At the time Olmert was convicted on a lesser charge of breach of trust after steering job appointments and contracts to clients of a business partner.

Olmert gave former office manager Shula Zaken part of the money in exchange for loyalty as well as using some for personal use, the judges concluded.

A retrial was organised after Zaken became a state witness, offering diary entries and tape recordings of conversations with Olmert about illicitly receiving cash. 

In a separate trial in March 2014 Olmert was convicted of bribery  and was sentenced to six years in prison. He appealed and has been allowed to stay out of jail until a verdict is delivered.

The judges must now decide if Olmert should serve additional prison time for today's conviction or whether his six-year sentence is enough  for both offences, legal expert Emanuel Gross said.

A decision is likely to be made in May.
