San Antonio Mayor Julian Castro will deliver the keynote address at the Democratic National Convention in September, the first Latino given the prime-time speaking slot on the opening night of the political gathering.

Mr Castro, 37, is a rising star among Democrats, with some political insiders predicting he could be the first Hispanic president of the United 
States.

The speech promises to raise Mr Castro's profile on the national political stage, following in the footsteps of Barack Obama, who delivered the keynote speech at the Democratic National Convention in 2004 when he was an Illinois State Senator and candidate for U.S. Senate.

The next big thing: San Antonio Mayor Julian Castro (speaking in June) will offer a rallying cry to Democrats as the keynote speaker at the convention in September

Where it all began: Barack Obama (with wife Michelle) launched his meteoric rise in politics with his keynote speech at the 2004 Democratic National Convention

Mr Obama wowed Democrats with his 2004 remarks, dubbed 'The Speech,' and four years later he returned to the party's convention to accept the Democratic presidential nomination.

'Being the keynote speaker at the convention this year is an honor I don’t take lightly,' Mr Castro said in a three-minute YouTube video, released Tuesday to announce his upcoming speaking gig.

'I know I’ve got some big shoes to fill,' he added.

First Lady Michelle Obama will also speak to delegates on the opening night of the convention,  which kicks off September 4 in Charlotte, North
Carolina.

Striking similarities can be seen between Mr Castro and President Obama -- both came from working 
class homes, ascended to the ranks of The Ivy League and entered 
politics in their mid-thirties.

What a difference four years makes: Barack Obama nabbed the Democratic presidential nomination in 2008

With an undergraduate degree from Stanford and a law degree from 
Harvard, Castro was elected mayor of his native San Antonio in 2009 and 
won a landslide reelection in 2011 with 83 per cent of the vote.

The decision to highlight Mr Castro at 
the convention is a strategic move by Democrats to mobilize Latinos, who 
have traditionally shown lackluster turnout at the polls, for the November presidential election.

Democrats will go head-to-head with Republicans in battleground states like Colorado, Florida and Nevada, where the Latino vote could heavily influence the outcome.

Republican presidential nominee, former Massachusetts Governor Mitt Romney, is also courting Latinos with the help of Senator Marco Rubio (R-Fla.) and George P. Bush, the charismatic son of former Florida Governor  Jeb 
Bush and his wife, Columba, a Mexican-born U.S. citizen.

A recent poll shows that Latino support for Mr Obama has jumped to 70 per cent, with the surge credited to the President's ruling against the deportation of certain young illegal immigrants.

Mr Romney only secured 22 per cent support among Latino voters, according to the poll conducted by Latino Decisions.
