Trabzonspor hope to finalise the £1.5m signing of Liverpool defender Kolo Toure after president Ibrahim Haciosmanoglu said: 'We have agreed terms with Kolo Toure and we will bring him to the club.' 

Toure, 33, has been offered a two year deal worth £40,000 a week after tax. However, he played in a behind closed doors game against Burnley on Monday and is considering his options.

The defender has one year left on contract but Liverpool will consider offers after the Anfield club signed Dejan Lovren from Southampton.
