Tory MP Nadine Dorries has been ordered to apologise to Parliament for refusing to say how much she earned as a contestant on I'm A Celebrity Get Me Out Of Here.

The maverick backbencher failed to inform the Commons authorities about the money she received for eight media appearances, including taking part in the ITV reality show a year ago.

Despite accusing investigators of a 'witch hunt' today in a short personal statement she told MPs she apologised 'fully and unreservedly for what was a genuinely inadvertent breach of the rules'.

She has been censured by the Commons Standards committee, which also complained about her attitude towards the investigation.

The
Mid Bedfordshire MP caused a storm in Westminster when she jetted off 
to Australia without getting permission from Tory party bosses in 
October last year.

She 
claimed she would be able to reach an audience of millions, discussing 
important policy issues like lowering the abortion limit.

Instead she was pictured performing 
jokes with Linda Robson from Birds Of A Feather and eating camel toe and
ostrich anus in a challenge against ex-Coronation Street star Helen 
Flanagan.

She was later suspended from the Tory party, and only allowed to return to the party fold in May this year.

The investigation into her finances was triggered after a complaint by Labour MP John Mann.

Sorry: Tory MP Nadine Dorries has been told to apologise to the Commons over the investigation into her payments for taking part in TV shows

In addition to taking part in I'm A Celebrity, Ms Dorries took part in another seven media appearances, investigators found after examining the website of the MP's agent.

Ms Dorries insisted the money had been paid to her company, Averbrook Ltd, and did not need to be declared.

She said she had 'no obligation to answer for what payments are made by whom to Averbook' and would only register earnings if Averbook paid her anything.

Nadine
Dorries has repeatedly made headlines for her outspoken remarks, including publicly criticising David Cameron and George Osborne.

March 2012:
On Cameron and Osborne's benefits changes: 'The problem is that policy 
is being run by two public schoolboys who don't know what it's like to 
go to the supermarket and have to put things back on the shelves because
they can't afford it for their children's lunchboxes. What's worse, 
they don't care, either.'

April 2012:
'Not only are Cameron and Osborne two posh boys who don't know the 
price of milk, but they are two arrogant posh boys who show no remorse, 
no contrition, and no passion to want to understand the lives of others -
and that is their real crime.'May 2012:
'In order for David Cameron’s position as leader to be challenged, the 
chairman of the committee needs to receive 46 signatures from 
Conservative MPs... I would guess that those signatures are already 
coming in and will reach 46 by Christmas.'November 2011: On taking part in I'm A Celeb: 'If that is where 16 million people are, it's where politicians need to be too'December 2012:
'I long for the day Boris Johnson is Prime Minister. He is a good man 
and a hero of mine, and he can reach people other politicians can’t.'January 2013: On talk Tory MP Adam Afriye was gearing up to challenge Mr Cameron: 'He has got leadership potential.' March 2013: 'We
need a change of direction. I think if these polls stay like this and 
we did badly in the May elections I think Cameron and Osborne will be 
forced to change direction.'

But the committee said it was 'hard 
to believe' that she would have been asked to take part in the show if 
she were not an MP, and as a result the earnings were linked to her role
in parliament.

The committee ordered Ms Dorries to 
register the details required by the rules but also took issue with her 
refusal to co-operate properly with the investigation, including her 
'attitude toward the Commissioner's inquiry'. 

She has updated her entry on the register of MPs' interests at the end of October, covering the previous 12 months.

It showed Averbrook's gross income 
was £142,000, giving a profit of £82,000, and that Ms Dorries had taken a
£10,000 dividend on October 30.

The committee said: 'Payments directly made for services should be registered whether or not they are made to a third party.'

But Ms Dorries told them that her contract with ITV meant she could not publicly say how much she had earned for taking part in I'm A Celebrity.

She told the committee: 'If I were ever to disclose and to say, “This is the amount of money that I am paid by ITV”, I would fall foul of that contract and would be at the mercy of ITV.'

She appeared on the show alongside comedian Brian Conley, darts player Eric Bristow, boxer David Hayes and ex-Eastenders actress Charlie Brooks, who eventually won.

Ms Dorries tried to justify her appearance on the show by saying she ‘mostly works seven days a week’ and ministers are often out of the country.

After just 11 days she became the first celebrity to be kicked out of the jungle in the results of a public vote.

She has since landed signed a ‘six-figure’ book deal to write three novels.

Ms Dorries threatened to sue Standards Commissioner Kathryn Hudson for pursuing a 'witch hunt' against her.

In a letter to the commissioner Ms Dorries wrote: 'I should inform you that I feel your report amounts to a witch hunt and I have forwarded it on to legal professionals for further advice regarding my position in relation to the committee and you personally.

'You are choosing to use a vexatious complaint made against me to reinforce your 'on the hoof, make it up as you go' policy.

'I will not tolerate that or any report which invokes libellous negative coverage against me as a result and will not hesitate to pursue you personally should that be the case.'

In a letter to Ms Hudson last month the MP said she had taken on extra media work to meet a £67,000 legal bill.

'As a single parent with financial responsibilities for a disabled ex-husband, an elderly mother and a child in full-time education, I faced the possibility of bankruptcy or finding a way to pay the bill.

'This is the initial impetus that drove me to undertake media work.'

Ms Dorries won a Bushtucker Trial against Coronation Street star Helen Flanagan, which involved eating ostrich anus

The report said: 'The House’s Code of
Conduct and disciplinary system depend on Members being prepared to 
explain their conduct, to submit to public scrutiny and where necessary,
to respond to the Commissioner’s inquiries.

'We
recommend that Ms Dorries register all payments in respect of her 
employment, whether or not they have been channelled through Averbrook 
Ltd or any other third party and apologise to the House by way of a 
Personal Statement.

'We
expect Ms Dorries to consult the Registrar in person about the detail 
of her Register entry within 21 days of publication of this Report. We 
will monitor Ms Dorries’s  compliance and will recommend further action 
if necessary.'
