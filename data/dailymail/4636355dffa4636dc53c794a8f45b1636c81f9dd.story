We've heard of the iPotty but now we've got the iBouncy chair - a special seat for babies complete with iPad holder.

This Christmas mothers and fathers will be treating their toddlers to the contraption created by Fisher-Price which allows children to watch videos and play with different apps from the comfort of their own bouncy chair. 

But parents and child development experts have slammed the device with one describing it as an 'embarrassment for humankind'.

Too early: The bouncy chair which comes complete with an iPad holder

The American Academy of Paediatrics recommends no screen time at all for children under the age of two.

The main reason is that at a time when babies and toddlers are learning to reach, crawl and walk, screen-based activities can be prioritised over those that encourage them to develop skills as well as language.

Some may argue that the recommendation was made in relation to TVs and not tablets. 

It is thought around 38 per cent of households now allow babies to use these devices - this is up 10 per cent from two years ago.

But not everyone is convinced.

Scores of parents and child development experts have been criticising the Newborn-to-Toddler Apptivity Seat for iPad device on Amazon. 

Mama Bee wrote: 'Evil abusive chair. The seat should be banned. Shame on you Fisher-Price. Built for neglect, future learning problems, attachment issues and ADHD. 

While N Marnell said: 'Please, do humanity a favour and DO NOT buy this! This is an embarrassment for humandkind'. 

Parents have posted negative reviews about the chair on Amazon where you can buy the seat for $75

However, there were some positive reviews mainly from parents of children with special needs.

Amanda J said: 'Parents of special needs children have been waiting for something like this for years! Great idea for kids with limited seating options that don't cost thousands of dollars.' 

For $75 the device is described by Fisher-Price as 'Soothing, entertaining and technology all in one great grow-with-me seat for baby! Lock your iPad device inside the case to protect from dribbles and drool.

Many of the positive reviews are from parents with children with special needs

'Play and learning are at baby’s fingertips, with free apps you can download for your iPad.'

In March the iPotty went on sale for children to watch videos and play games while ansewering he call the nature. 

The gadget, which costs $35 on Amazon, was invented after figures showed a huge increase in children as young as three being given iPads for Christmas.

Why a two-year-old may need to check emails, write memos or just stare at the screen while spending a penny is anyone's guess but the firm who invented it, CTA Digital, said it had brilliant feedback from busy parents. 

Fisher-Price told The Huffington Post: 'We can understand how, at first glance, it may appear that the screen is always in front of baby with an iPad in place. 

'We’d like to point out that parents can remove the toy bar that holds the iPad completely or they can choose to use the toy bar with just the mirror.'
