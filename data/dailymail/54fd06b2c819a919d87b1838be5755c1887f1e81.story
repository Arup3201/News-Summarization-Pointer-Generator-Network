It was confirmed today that Bernie Ecclestone has paid the agreed £60million to clear him of bribery charges, but the Formula One boss is showing no signs of adjusting his luxurious lifestyle.

This afternoon he was spotted celebrating the end of the three month trial with his third wife Fabiana Flosi and friends as they toured the Croatian island of Havr.  

The 83-year-old walked around the pretty town centre with his 35-year-old wife before they retreated to his luxury yacht Petara which was anchored in the bay.

The southern Dalmatian is a favourite with Ecclestone and the 176ft vessel, which is named Petara, after Bernie's daughters Petra and Tamara, was also  spotted moored in several ports across Croatia last year.

Not that Ecclestone should have been too concerned about his bank balance in light of recent events - he is worth an estimated £6billion. 

Ecclestone faced charges of bribery and incitement to breach of trust over a payment to a German banker in charge of selling a stake in F1 in 2005. 

Ecclestone denied wrongdoing. 

After the three month trial, on August 5 the Munich state court approved an agreement between Ecclestone's lawyers and prosecutors to end the trial.

It gave the 83-year-old Englishman a week to pay the money and the court said today that the payment was made on time. 

£58.6m will go directly to the German state, with the remainder to a German charity that looks after terminally-ill children. 

Last week's result was not the scenario Ecclestone envisaged as he was determined to prove his innocence, but with the trial exacting a toll, the 83-year-old and his defence team decided to make the offer.
