A dead dog has been found hanging from a metal chain on a residential street just yards from a primary school after suffering a ‘slow and painful death’.

The RSPCA today released the disturbing image of the lifeless Staffordshire Bull Terrier Bull Mastiff cross in a bid to catch the thugs who left him in Dudley, West Midlands.

A passer-by found the dog dangling 15ft from metal railings early Saturday morning - and the scene was so horrendous that he told the RSPCA he thought the lifeless dog had been nailed to the wall.

Both police and the RSPCA - which described it as 'one of the most shocking crimes we have seen in many years' - were called to Bishop Close, near Kates Hill Primary School, where the dog was found.

Disturbing pictures show the dog hanging against a brick wall by a chain fixed to metal railings above. He had no other signs of abuse or neglect and police believe he may have been a pet.

RSCPA Inspector Dave McCartney said: ‘This was a deliberate act. Whoever has done this has lowered the dog over the fence and pulled the chain up and fixed it to the railings above.

‘We won’t know all of the physical details about this dog’s death until after the post-mortem results come in. But there is no doubt in my own mind that this dog would have suffered.

'We want to find the owner, but we also really need to find whoever was responsible for killing this dog in such an horrific way.’

Labour MP for Dudley North Ian Austin
 said: ‘Decent people will be appalled by such a horrendous crime. It is
 utterly barbaric and you have to question the mentality of the people 
responsible. 

‘Someone must
 know who did this and I hope they come forward with any information 
they have so the police and RSPCA can bring the perpetrators to 
justice.’

And Deputy Mayor 
of Dudley Steve Waltho said: ‘I am an animal lover myself. I can't think
 what goes through people's minds to do such a barbaric act as this. 

‘I
 was numb when I heard and I am appalled by it. If you're displeased 
with an animal then shoo it off but to physically and callously strangle
 a dog? I can't imagine what these people were thinking.’

Meanwhile,
 the leader of Dudley Conservative Group, Councillor Patrick Harley, 
added: ‘I hope if they find the person who did this that the same 
punishment could be administered to them. 

‘As
 an owner of two Staffordshire bull terriers I'd be first in the queue 
to give them a taste of their own medicine. They are absolutely low life
 and don't deserve to be breathing the same air as the rest of us.’

An RSPCA spokesman added: ‘There was no signs of any obvious neglect or abuse. The dog was actually in a good physical condition, apart from the obvious, suggesting it may have been a family pet.

'This was a deliberate act. Whoever has done this has lowered the dog over the fence and pulled the chain up and fixed it to the railings above'

Dave McCartney, RSCPA Inspector

‘It had been given a proper diet and had obviously been cared for at some point. It did not deserve to suffer such a slow and painful death.

‘It is obviously a horrendous crime and one of the most shocking we have seen in many years. We just urge anyone who might know anything to get in touch.’

The dog was said to have been aged between one and two and was not micro-chipped. Anyone with any potential details about the dog’s owner or culprit is urged to call the RSPCA on 0300 123 8018.
