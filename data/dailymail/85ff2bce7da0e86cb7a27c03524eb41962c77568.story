Councils have been criticised after it emerged an event they are sending workers to has advised packing ibuprofen and vitamin C - to beat hangovers.

Around 118 public officials are being flown out to the French Riviera to attend the taxpayer-funded four-day event in March.

But organisers of the Marche International Des Professionnels De L’Immobilier (MIPIM) have warned attendees the trip will cause 'exhaustion' thanks to its action-packed party schedule. 

Council workers have been told to pack ibuprofen and vitamin C to beat hangovers at an international property event in Cannes, France. Attendees are pictured above at last year's event enjoying a cool beer in the sun

Workers will be wined and dined at the prestigious Palais Des Festivals, which also hosts the Cannes Film Festival, as they try to secure future investment for their areas. Individual tickets cost £1,160.

A guide to the international property fair, written as part of a blog on the official event's website, said: 'Networking extends into late evening and for some that means the wee hours of morning.

'Yes, it happens to the best of us. And yes, we feel pretty rotten the next day. Magic fix? A good ibuprofen and a heavy dose of Vitamin C usually does the trick. At least until midday...' 

But the flippant advice has sparked outrage.

John O'Connell, director of the TaxPayers' Alliance, said: 'It's stunning to see them blow huge sums on a jolly.'

The largest sole contingent to attend this year is a 22-strong delegation led by Nottingham City Council leader Jon Collins.

Their ticket allocation alone cost more than £25,000.

The Scottish Government has also paid £18,500 for tickets for a 16-strong team under its 'Cities Alliance' banner.

Two employees from Edinburgh City Council have been given a budget of £2,454 for 'travel and accommodation'. The council was unable to estimate the cost of food and drink.

Individual tickets cost £1,160. Delegates are pictured above eating, drinking and enjoying the beautiful view at the 2014 MIPIM show

Glasgow City Council is also sending a team but added that 'it's impossible' to reveal the true cost to the taxpayer until after the event.

Highland Council, which is planning to shed up to 1,000 jobs over the next five years, is sending delegates.

Local politicians and employees are also attending from Aberdeen, Dundee, Newcastle and Perth.

A Cities Alliance spokesman said: 'We can't give final costs.

'Bringing the cities together allows us to showcase investment opportunities.'
