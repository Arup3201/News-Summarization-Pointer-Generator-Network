Hit: Elsa, the Snow Queen (voiced by Idina Menzel) is pictured performing the song in the Disney film, Frozen

Speaking to The Hollywood Reporter, she said: 'A year ago, I'd meet people who, when they found out who I was, they'd say, "Oh, we love the songs! We sing them all the time".

'Now they're like, "Yep, we're still listening to those songs". I've gone from, "Thank you", to, "Sorry!"'

Following Frozen's release in November 2013, the Disney film quickly became the highest-grossing in its genre, netting $1.27 billion worldwide. 

At the same time, the popularity of 'Let It Go' - performed by Idina Menzel - soared.

Over the past year, the song has been covered or parodied by countless fans, singers and other celebrities, including Kristen Wiig, Ellen DeGeneres, Christina Bianco and Rashida Jones.

It has even been performed by TV host Jimmy Fallon, who sung it alongside Menzel in March.

And last month, Demi Lovato - who released a pop version of 'Let It Go' as a single last October - performed a stunning rendition during the Royal Variety Performance in London.

During the interview, Lee, whose daughter, Agatha Lee Mon, 11, sings in the film, said she remains amazed by the movie and song's global impact and their apparent resonance with young girls.

She added that she often uses Frozen's 'strong female lead characters' - sisters Anna and Elsa, the Snow Queen - as inspiration for her daughter, whom she says was bullied at school.

'I was bullied a lot as a kid, too,' says Lee, 'so we try to look at the world like Anna and Elsa do - how they question, "Is who I am OK?" - but always manage to be true to themselves.'

Another in the making? Earlier this month, Menzel (left, who plays Elsa, right, in the hit Disney film), 43, sparked hope of a Frozen sequel when asked if a continuation of the film was in the works by the Today Show

Earlier this month, Menzel, also 43, sparked hope of a Frozen sequel when asked if a continuation of the film was in the works by the Today Show.

In response to the question, the Broadway star said: 'You know, I have no idea - I just assumed that because it's so successful that's what they're up to.' 

And in a separate interview with The Telegraph,  she said a second feature was 'in the works... hopefully'. She added: 'We’ll see. I’m just going along for the ride.'

Over the past 12 months, 'Let It Go' has been performed and parodied online by hundreds of fans.

Last month, in celebration of Movember, Richard Annett and Jesse Hawkins, both from California, created a rousing parody of the song, titled: 'Let It Grow', before posting it on the web.

In their three minute 40 second video, Hawkins sings about how he's ditched his razor and doesn't care what his boss will say, while Annett stars as a backing dancer. 

'Don’t shear, don’t fear, be the burly man every girl will crave!' Hawkins bellows.

Meanwhile in February, a Cincinnati, Ohio, traffic reporter  gained national attention after performing a dramatic on-air parody of the Disney song. 

WKRC's Bob Herzog changed 'Let It Go' to 'Just Don't Go' to reference the winter weather.

As images of cars skidding on ice and traffic conditions play, he sung the lines like: 'I must share what dispatchers say, all the traction's gone. School's closed or at least they're on a delay.' 

A British father and daughter also went viral after filming themselves singing 'Let It Go', with their video gaining nearly 20 million views in just three days.

As she sings at the top of her lungs, little Lily stretches her arms wide in true diva style.

And in March, a Texas university student filmed himself singing 'Let It Go' in the voices of 21 different Disney and Pixar characters from almost every classic film.
