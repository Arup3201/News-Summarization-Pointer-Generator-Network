Dani Vallverdu has played down talk of a rift with Andy Murray insisting the end of their working partnership was 'genuinely mutual'.

Murray made a host of changes to his group last season, hiring Amelie Mauresmo as coach to replace Ivan Lendl who left his post in March and then stopping working with long-time friend Vallverdu and fitness trainer Jez Green.

The exit of Vallverdu raised some eyebrows as the pair met at the Sanchez-Casal Academy in Spain more than a decade ago and the Venezuelan held an increasingly important role in the coaching team under Lendl.

In an interview with The Independent earlier this month, Murray appeared to suggest that the relationship had become strained, saying: 'The most important point in any team is that everyone has the same vision, everyone wants to move forward together. Maybe the last four or five months of last year it wasn't like that.'

But Vallverdu, who is now coaching Tomas Berdych, insists that was not the case and that the relationship had simply run its course.

'We were all pulling in the same direction,' he told the Daily Mail.

'I'm quite proud of how we pulled it around after the US Open. It was pretty hard, him qualifying for (the ATP Tour Finals in) London from his position after New York.

'Of course Andy is the one who played the matches but everyone had the goal of helping him get there. I don't think the last four months are a reason we aren't working together any more, it was genuinely mutual.

'His determination, professionalism and stubbornness, that's what has made him so successful but, because of the way he is, it gets to the point when it is time for both parties to go their own ways.'

He added: 'Andy and I have been friends for nearly 15 years. Our personal relationship is still good, I consider him one of my best friends and I'll always be in his corner, except for when I am coaching against him.'
