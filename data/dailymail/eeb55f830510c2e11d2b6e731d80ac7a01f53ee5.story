American football star Philip Wheeler has condemned the 'boob haters' who lashed out at his model girlfriend when she posted a picture of her breastfeeding his son.

The Miami Dolphins linebacker has defended his partner Ashley Nicole, claiming she is being 'unfairly attacked' over the photograph she uploaded to her Instagram profile last month.

The new mother posted the picture to her 23,000 followers showing her son feeding inside the couple's home.

She wrote: 'Was on the way out the door but then mommy duty called... Everything stops for him! #breastisbest #natureisbeautiful'

Wheeler told TMZ.com: 'I wish everybody would just leave it alone.

'She's a model. She takes pictures for a living.'

He said when supermodel Gisele posted a picture of her breastfeeding her daughter Vivian in December, she received nothing but praise.

The photograph is still post on Ashley's Instagram page and it is understood Miss Nicole has no plans to remove it.

The image has so far attracted more than 2,000 likes from users as well as a raft of comments supporting Miss Nicole.

While reesebutt, added: 'You go mama, I breastfed as well, don't let all this get you down or get to you. It's a beautiful picture and beautiful act.'

Posting her reaction to negative comments, Miss Nicole posted another picture to her Instagram profile, alongside the caption: 'For all the people who had something negative to say about my post feeding my baby... #normalizebreastfeeding #getalife.'

The message said: 'People always want to see your breasts, until you're feeding a baby then it's considered indecent... anyone else see the flaw in this logic?'
