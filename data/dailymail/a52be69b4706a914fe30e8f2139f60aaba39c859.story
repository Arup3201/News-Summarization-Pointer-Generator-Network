Jailed: Janet Chapman abandoned her jury duty to enjoy a week long holiday in Malta

A woman juror who abandoned a four-week robbery trial to jet off on holiday to Malta was jailed last night for 56 days for contempt of court.

Janet Chapman, 51, said she thought it would fine to travel abroad for a week because her doctor had signed her off work due to a bad back.

The next day she phoned the court and left a telephone message saying: ‘Hello, this is Janet Chapman.... I won’t be attending court for a period of up to two weeks.

'I have got to return to the doctor’s next Tuesday. I have got sciatica. Thankyou. Bye.’

She then flew off to enjoy some winter sun on a £669 week-long holiday in Malta with her long-time partner Raymond Pritchard.

But she had a nasty surprise when she touched down at Liverpool Airport as a welcoming party of police officers was waiting to arrest her.

Judge Anthony Russell QC said: ‘It is clear you deliberately deceived the court for your own ends and pleasure.

‘Your assertion that you were unaware that you could not go away on holiday whilst absent from jury duty due to what you maintain was illness is ludicrous.

‘I am satisfied that if you really 
suffered back pain of such severity that that you could not continue 
your jury service you would not have been able to endure the travel to 
Malta.

‘I am driven to the 
conclusion that you pretended to your doctor that you had a back problem
in order that you could take a holiday in Malta.’

Busted: Chapman was caught after an official at Preston Crown court noticed she had called from a foreign number

Preston Crown Court heard potential jurors were told to indicate if they had a holiday or hospital admission which would leave them unable to sit on a serious robbery trial.

At the start of the trial of robbery suspect Raymond Mallen, Chapman did not notify the court why she should not be part of the jury.

He was accused of being part of an organised gang which carried out a 
series of high value cash-in-transit robberies across the North West of 
England.

Evidence had been 
heard and Judge Stuart Baker was about to begin summing up when Chapman 
phoned the courts and left her message.

Yesterday
she told the court the holiday last month had been a birthday surprise 
from her partner and she had only learned about the trip the night 
before they flew out.

Chapman, a deputy manager at a children’s residential home, said that having suffered a back injury and been signed off sick from work she didn’t think she would have to attend the trial.

She said: ‘On the Monday morning I couldn’t get out of bed. I went to the doctor that night. I was signed off for a week. I didn’t think I was doing anything wrong.’

Surprise: Chapman's partner, Raymond Pritchard, told the court he had booked the £669 holiday in January, but had not told her about it until the night before

Her partner, Raymond Pritchard, told the court he booked the £669 holiday in January, but had not told her about it until the night before.

Judge Russell said it had been a serious contempt of court.

He said: ‘You have manifestly failed to perform your public duty. Further, it is clear that you deliberately deceived the court for your own ends and pleasure, namely taking a holiday in Malta.’

The case carried on and Mallen was convicted of conspiracy to rob and jailed 12 years. Various gang members have now been jailed for a total of more than 80 years in all.

Last night Mr Pritchard choked back tears at his semi-detached property on the outskirts of Blackpool and said the mistake would cost them dear..

He said: ‘Obviously we did not know what the consequences would be. I have never stepped into a court of any kind until today. This could well lose my wife her job. She works with children and it is a job she loves.

‘Janet has never done anyone any harm. Then to come home from holiday and get arrested at the airport, it was terrible.

I have not heard from her since she was jailed I don’t know when she will be able to phone me.

‘I think what has happened is like using a jack hammer to crack a nut. I don’t know how she will cope behind bars...I just told her to survive it.’

Last year juror Matthew Banks, 19, was jailed for 14 days after phoning a court and saying he was ill so he could go and watch a West End musical with his mother. He was released four days later on appeal.

Detective Chief Inspector Lee Halstead, said: ‘His Honour Judge Russell QC, the Recorder of Preston, has sent a clear message that as a member of the public, fulfilling your responsibility on jury service is a fundamental cornerstone of the British criminal justice system and is to be taken seriously.'
