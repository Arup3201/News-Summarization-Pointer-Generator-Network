Sales of prosecco have increased by more than 90 per cent, making it nearly twice as popular as champagne.

Experts say wine-lovers are more aware now than at any other time about what they are buying when it comes to bubbly,

The
 Italian fizz market has almost doubled in the past year; while sales 
of champagne are falling flat, taking a nosedive of 16 per cent over the 
same period.

However branded and retailer-exclusive 
champagnes fared better, being up 4 per cent making the champagne market 
worth £280million.

Market research also revealed that the worldwide revenue of own-label Italian sparkling wine grew from £50.2million to £95.4million from January 2013 to January 2014. 

Prosecco's performance is also outshining cava - the UK cava market is currently worth £169million, down from £175million from last year.

The International Wine and Spirit 
Competition announced the Northern Hemisphere results on Monday at the 
start of the London Wine Fair and the highest achievers for own-label prosecco were the following retailers: 

The research comes from Nielson, a key authority in market 
research for all grocery.

The data is taken on take-home sales only and 
it is based on all products sold and scanned through the tills in UK 
supermarkets.

Canti Prosecco Brut, £6, and Freixenet Cordon Negro Cava, £7.99, are two of Bring A Bottle's top sellers

Rosie Davenport, Editor of Off Licence News magazine who published the Nielson research, said: 

'What we are seeing is that the very cheap own label 
champagne is definitely being eroded by prosecco.

'Italian fizz has become a more sophisticated option and moved away from the very sweet styles into an everyday drink that's fashionable; but also a fun and sociable option that you can 
open and enjoy with friends at any time - and certainly isn't only 
reserved for special occasions.

'Consumers are finding it more accessible and are preferring the style, 
however they are still buying into the more established champagne brands.

'This has hit some of the cheaper champagnes, though there are signs that the more well-known names are holding their own, and, if anything, the prosecco effect has helped by opening up the world of sparkling wines and champagnes to a new set of consumers.

The figures show the total Italian sparkling sector is worth £229.3 million.

A spokesperson for supermarket wine, beers and spirits price comparison site, bringabottle.co.uk, said:

'As far as the quality goes it definitely has been improving for the past five or so years, and the sales reflect that.

'Some of the top sparkling recommendations from the wine experts over the Christmas period (traditionally the best selling time) were for prosecco rather than champagne.

'In the battle for the sparkling wines (champagne, prosecco, cava and the New World) prosecco is the closest to champagne; cava being slightly less sweet and having more bubbles.

'Consumers are more aware than at any other time that 'champagne' is just another term for sparkling wine (albeit produced in the champagne region) and that the prices do not necessarily reflect the quality of the product.

'The champagne houses and supermarkets are reacting to the rise in prosecco sales and some of the biggest champagne brands prices were reduced by slightly more than 50 per cent over the Christmas period in order to make champagne more appealing to consumers who would otherwise be buying prosecco and other sparkling wines.'

•    The taste profile of prosecco is 
slightly different to champagne. There are many styles available, however
 typically prosecco is sweeter and lighter, which has helped its broader 
appeal.

•    The production methods in champagne and prosecco are 
different as is the aging process and the length of time it has been 
matured, which effects the taste.
