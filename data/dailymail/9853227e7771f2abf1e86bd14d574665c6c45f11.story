This bungling thief is clearly no bright spark after managing to set himself on fire while trying to steal live high-voltage power cable.

Blundering Richard Howells caused a power cut to 1,000 homes – including his own grandmother’s who found herself stranded on her electric stairlift for several hours until engineers could fix the problem.

The 21-year-old, of Penlan, Swansea, saw sparks fly from his fingers and set himself on fire when he used a screwdriver to try pry out part of the 11,000-watt cable which he hoped to sell to pay his £140 phone bill.

City magistrates were told he almost died and had to roll on the floor to put the flames on his body out after the near fatal theft on April 4.

He was tracked down by police after they checked local hospitals for people who had been admitted with burns.

Howells’s solicitor, Phil Huxtable, said:
'It’s only by luck he is able to face the court today. He came close to
killing himself through his own stupidity.'

Magistrates sentenced him to four months in prison, suspended for 12 months.

He was told to pay costs of £80 and an
£80 victim surcharge but chairwoman of the bench, Jennifer Wright, said
they could not award compensation because Howells would not be able to 
pay them.

'It’s quite horrific what could have happened to you but also to other people who lost their power.

'People have all sorts of life-preserving machinery and they could have died through that stupid act,' she told Howells.

Prosecutor Julie Sullivan said Western Power were called and told a large number of homes had been affected by a power cut and the problem stemmed from an electricity pole between Cadle Mill and Westdale Road, Blaenymaes.

Engineers arrived and found a tough mains cable, which comes out of the ground, had been cut through.

Mrs
Sullivan said: 'The only way it could have been cut through was in a 
deliberate act and would have been extremely dangerous for the person 
carrying out that act. There could have been a fatality.'

The repairs took four hours and cost more than £4,800.

Police
helicopters were deployed to find the culprit, but when that did not 
turn up results, police checked hospitals and found two people had 
checked in with burns injuries.

Howells,
of Penlan, Swansea, had serious injuries and he had been transferred to 
the burns unit, Mrs Sullivan said.

He told staff he had got the injuries
after starting a fire in the woods near his girlfriend’s house and said
they had been caused by a piece of wood.

Warning signs: Howells ignored the signs which warned: 'Danger of death - Keep off' which were on electricity pylons in the Blaenymaes area of Swansea

Police then went to his girlfriend’s address at Penplas Road and found off-cuts of the missing cable in her garden.

Howells, who admitted attempted theft and criminal damage, said he planned to sell the cable.

Mr Huxtable, for Howells, said: 'He’s fully aware this was a stupid offence to have committed and it almost cost him his life. He has had direct knowledge of the impact of this offending on people.

'His own grandmother in fact was stuck on her stairlift for several hours before the power was restored.'

He said Howells decided to steal the cable after failing to find regular work and racking up a £140 phone bill. He had argued with his girlfriend about the phone bill.

He said he went to the pylon and 'didn’t really consider the consequences of his actions.'

He said Howells took himself to the police station, and if he had not done so the police would have struggled to find him.
