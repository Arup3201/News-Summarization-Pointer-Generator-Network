For those looking for romance, a quick trip to the country may just be worth your while.

A recent study has found that Britain's single hotspots are found in some rather unlikely locations.

While you may think that London or Manchester would be brimming with daters, it's actually the little-known towns, such as West Malling, Kent, or Northallerton, North Yorkshire that boast the highest number of active singles by population.

Wouldn't this make a lovely date spot? St Leonard's Tower is in West Malling, Kent, which is one of the UK's singleton hotspots

Looking for love in London? Think again! For the best chances at romance, try a smaller town, like Huntington, Cambridgeshire

In fact, according to match.com, both towns have more than eight times as many daters per 1000 population than the capital.

1. West Malling, Kent

2. Northallerton, North Yorkshire

3. Huntington, Cambridgeshire

4. Aberdeen, Aberdeenshire

5. Prescot, Merseyside

6. Cheadle, Greater Manchester

7. Stockton Heath, Cheshire

8. Epsom, Surrey

9. Leigh-On-Sea, Essex

10. Windsor, Berkshire

11. Truro, Cornwall

12. Malborough, Wiltshire

13. Cambridge, Cambridgeshire

14. Cirencester, Gloucestershire

15. Henley-on-Thames, Oxfordshire

16. Chichester, West Sussex

17. Bridgnorth, Shropshire

18. Banstead, Surrey

19. Stratford-Upon-Avon, Warwickshire

20. Marlow, Buckinghamshire 

Huntingdon in Cambridgeshire and Aberdeen are also home to highly concentrated populations of singles.

Match.com Managing Director, Karl Gregory, says: 'Although big cities have more singles in total, their greater populations mean that they are not as concentrated as in these small hotspots.'

And it may just be worth a trip.

Though West Malling, Kent, is not known for its nightlife, the small market town is famous for its historic buildings, such as St. Leonard's Tower, and its cricketing heritage.

The village, with a population of 2,266, has the highest number of active daters in proportion to its population. 

Keep an eye out for a potential mate while taking in the town's quaint surroundings, which include a 1966 abbey church, used by the Anglican Benedictine nuns.

For those in further North, it may be time to visit Northallerton in North Yorkshire (population 16,832) and Aberdeen in the Scottish Highlands.

Aberdeen, Scotland's third most populous city, offers plenty of first date picks to suit any taste.

From dolphin spotting excursions and scenic fishing village strolls to the contemporary Aberdeen Art Gallery, the city is full of options for young workers who've relocated for work. 

Northallerton in North Yorkshire also has a large percentage of daters. Pictured: Market Cross High Street

In Scotland, Aberdeen is home to many young adults looking for love - especially after so many oil industry workers have re-located to the city

Users in more than 500 towns and cities from across the UK were analysed as part of the project.

Gregory added: 'Some of these [results] are more easily explained than others.

Aberdeen, for example, has a number of workers who have re-located to the city due to its oil industry, and people in a new town may be more likely to use dating sites to find a partner or just meet some new people.

'Places such as West Malling or Northallerton though are a bit more of a mystery.

We can only assume that in smaller towns such as these, good news spreads fast, and that those who have found dates or met a partner through sites like match.com recommend their friends also try the service.'
