The New York Police Department bomb squad shut down the Brooklyn Bridge for two hours on Memorial Day after driver reported a suspicious SUV without a license plate abandoned midway across the span.

After a heavily-armored bomb technician tore through the vehicle and a bomb-sniffing dog gave it a once-over, the NYPD offered the all-clear and re-opened the key East River crossing to traffic about 7pm on Monday.

The suspicious Dodge Durango was parked in a Manhattan-bound lane of the iconic bridge. Police shut down all traffic - both pedestrians and cars - while they ensured that it did not contain explosives.

Abandoned: The Dodge Durango SUV had no license plate. It was abandoned in a Manhattan-bound lane, about midway across the span

Icon: The Brooklyn Bridge is one of the most recognizable landmarks in New York City. It is also a key East River crossing for more than 120,000 vehicles a day

In 2010, an al-Qaeda-trained Pakistani-American parked an SUV full of explosives in Times Square and left. Lucky, the bombs failed to detonate, but the NYPD has been on alert for possible car bombs ever since.

The only threat that Monday's 
abandoned SUV posed, though, was snarled holiday traffic in lower 
Manhattan and downtown Brooklyn.

Motorists called 911 to report the suspicious SUV about 5.15pm on Monday.

Police quickly shut down the entire bridge, clogging holiday traffic in both downtown Brooklyn and downtown Manhattan.

Several NYPD bomb squad vehicles slowly passed by the car, possibly scanning it for explosives.

Then, a heavily-armored bomb technician searched the vehicle. After his inspection, he walked back to waiting bomb squad units and took off his helmet.

Brave: A lone bomb disposal officer was dispatched to inspect the SUV. After several minutes of tearing out floor mats and padding, he found nothing dangerous in the vehicle

On guard: The NYPD has been on the lookout for possible car bombs since the failed bombing attempt of Times Square in 2010

Moments later, an NYPD officer, who was not wearing armor, approached the vehicle with a bomb-sniffing dog.

After the dog inspected the vehicle, that officer returned to the cadre of NYPD trucks parked a few hundred feet away.

Moments later, the NYPD said the vehicle posed no threat.

On May 1, 2010, a Pakistani-born American named Faisal Shahzad parked a Nissan Pathfinder SUV loaded with explosives in Times Square. However, the improvised car bomb failed to detonate.

The VIN on the dashboard, a unique identification number for the vehicle, had been removed.

Just three days later, the RFK Bridge in Manhattan had to be evacuated after a driver abandoned a U-Haul rental truck near the toll plaza.

That vehicle was found to have nothing suspicious inside.

However, that incident snarled New York City traffic for hours, as well.
