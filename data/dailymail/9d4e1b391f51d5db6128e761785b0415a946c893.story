Two adults and a 15-year-old have been arrested after they allegedly posted videos showing them kicking a little boy in the head multiple times on Instagram, with the caption 'the kid loves it.'

Police in Konawa, Oklahoma, said Joshua Whittington, 28, his girlfriend, Tracy Casteel, 33, and Casteel's teenage son are in custody after the disturbing footage was made public Wednesday.

According to KFOR, the first of two disturbing videos shows the 8-year-old, clad in a football-helmet, being violently kicked in the head by the teenager who uses both feet for greater impact. After the second kick, the child starts to cry, The Ada News reports.

Konawa Assistant Police Chief Jason Teel told The Ada News that the victim is Whittington's son while the 15-year-old is Casteel's son.

He said police believe Whittington was filming the shocking game and that a female voice, suspected to be Casteel's, is heard in the background.

A status update on a Facebook page belonging to the couple said Wednesday that the teen was 'teaching' the child  'to defend himself.'

Teel said the child, who along with two other children in the home has been placed in state custody, appears to have no serious injuries, but did suffer bruising to his neck and chest.

The clips were posted Wednesday but by late Thursday both had been pulled from the internet.

All three suspects were arrested on 
suspicion of aggravated assault. Whittington and Casteel were also 
arrested on suspicion of child abuse and enabling child abuse.

'It makes us feel good, with a case like this, we can get after them and get them arrested within a short period of time,' Teel told The Ada News. 'We had them arrested about two hours into the investigation.'
