Trust in the European Union has collapsed in the wake of the Eurozone crisis, according to a major new survey paid for by Brussels.

The poll of more than 32,000 people across Europe found that just 31 per cent of the public now say they trust the EU, with 60 per cent saying they do not.

The figures suggest trust in Brussels has almost halved since the Eurozone crisis. In 2007, before the crisis erupted, some 57 per cent of people said they trusted the EU compared to just 32 per cent who said they did not.

But, although the poll was paid for by the European Commission, the stark findings were not mentioned in a press release it put out on the results. In a release entitled 'A greater dose of optimism', the Commission chose to focus on more positive findings about prospects for the European economy.

Instead, the figures revealing the collapse in trust were buried in 200-page report giving a full breakdown on the poll's findings.

Vincenzo Scarpetta of the think tank Open Europe, said: 'Despite what the Commission suggests, it is clear that trust in the EU is falling.

'This latest survey exposes the extent of the breakdown between citizens and the EU - particularly in crisis-hit southern eurozone countries, which seem to be losing faith in the EU as a positive counter-balance to unpredictable national politics.'

The findings will also bolster David Cameron's drive to reform the EU to reduce meddling by Brussels and make it more accountable to voters.

The regular 'Eurobarometer' poll is conducted twice a year on behalf of the Commission.

It found that the British public view Brussels with greater mistrust than most of Europe. In the UK, just 20 per cent of people said they had trust in the EU, with 68 per cent saying they do not.

But Britain is no longer the most Eurosceptic country in the EU. Greece, Spain and Cyprus, which have suffered the disastrous consequences of being in the single currency, all now report lower levels of trust in the EU than Britain.

In Cyprus just 13 per cent, which was forced to agree crippling terms in return for a bailout this year, said they trusted the EU, with 83 per cent saying they did not.

Across Europe, just 23 per cent of people said they thought things were 'going in right direction' in EU, 49 per cent not.

In another damaging finding, a record number of people said they felt their views were ignored by the EU's elite.

Just 28 per cent of people said they felt their voice was heard in Brussels, with a record 67 per cent saying it was not.

Some 55 per cent of people said they thought the worst of the economic crisis was 'yet to come'. But this was down from a peak of 68 per cent in 2011.

And, despite the crisis, the poll found a narrow majority still saying they supported the single currency, with 51 per cent in favour of the euro and 42 per cent against. In the UK, just 15 per cent of people backed the euro, with 79 per cent against.

Views on the future of the EU were deadlocked, with 49 per cent saying they are optimistic against 46 per cent saying they are pessimistic.
