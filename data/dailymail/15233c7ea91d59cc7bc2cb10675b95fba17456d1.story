New images show the moment Jeremy Kyle was pepper-sprayed by a nightclub bouncer who said he was 'making Magaluf look s***'.

Footage of the incident is due to be broadcast for the first time since the infamous chat show host was attacked while filming an exposé of the island resort.

Today he described his bodyguard-flanked escape from the scene  as 'the longest 100-yard walk of my life' and told how jeering onlookers shouted obscenities at him.

Attack: New images show the moment divisive TV host Jeremy Kyle was left coughing and spluttering on the streets of Magaluf after being pepper-sprayed by a bouncer - who said he was making the resort 'look s***'

The presenter escaped flanked by bodyguards as jeering onlookers shouted at him, he said

The attack features in a new series by the controversial presenter, whose ITV show was described by a judge in 2007 as 'human bear-baiting', which sees him leave the sofa and hit the streets.

Embarking on a half-hour exposé of youth drinking culture, Kyle sent undercover stooges into shops to see if they could buy alcohol underage and visited the Spanish party resort of Magaluf.

It was on the resort's famous strip of bars that the attack happened last July. Until today, images from his own crew's cameras had never been released.

Recalling the incident, Kyle said tension had built when 'thousands' of onlookers started chanting  at him.

'Then all of a sudden I couldn't breathe, my eyes were streaming and my lungs were burning,' he told The Sun.

Exposé: The images are from a new documentary by the chat show host on Britain's binge drinking culture

Speaking to The Sun, Kyle described his escape (pictured) as 'the longest 100-yard walk of my life'

'My security guard grabbed me and marched me through the shouting crowds to the van.

'It was the longest 100-yard walk of my life. I didn't even have time to feel frightened. I just had no idea what was going on.'

The 40-year-old Romanian bouncer named Leon who attacked Kyle stood his ground after the attack last year, saying the ITV show gave his resort bad press.

Leon - who said he would happily spray Kyle again - said at the time: 'He was walking down the strip with camera making it look s***. He wasn't showing the good side of Magaluf. 

'It's actually a nice place to live which is why you find lots of families here with their kids being raised here.'

Asked what he thought of the bouncer's claims, Kyle called him a 'stupid man'.

He added the resort on the island of Majorca is 'obviously dangerous' because of the high number of British teenagers who drink to excess on their first holiday with friends.

The TV host, whose Jeremy Kyle Show will mark its tenth anniversary in July, said the bouncer's approach had backfired because it had prompted far more coverage of Magaluf in the media.

The documentary airing the footage will also see the TV host conduct interviews with police and ambulance services who have to deal with the aftermath of alcohol abuse on British shores.

Named the Kyle Files, it begins with an exposé of legal highs this week before moving on to the topics of knife crime on January 15 and binge drinking on January 22.

Kyle visited Magaluf after a string of shocking stories of binge drinking, including an 18-year-old woman who was filmed performing a sex act on 24 men for a cocktail.

The clip spread online and prompted a national outcry over the resort's culture, as well as complaints that the girl had been used and put in a vulnerable position.

The Kyle Files airs on ITV at 7.30pm on Thursday.
