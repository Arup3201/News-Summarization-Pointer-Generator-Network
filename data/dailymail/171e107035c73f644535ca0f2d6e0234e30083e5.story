Wearing casual white attire, the two sons of former Egyptian president Hosni Mubarak leave court today after a new session of their trial in Cairo.

Gamal, the one-time heir-apparent, and Alaa are accused of complicity in the killing of more than 800 protesters during last year's uprising that toppled Mubarak's 29-year regime.

Earlier, their father, who faces the same charges, was wheeled into the court on a stretcher wearing dark sunglasses and covered in a green blanket.

The 83-year-old, who was brought by helicopter to the courthouse from a hospital where he is being held in custody, is suffering from a heart condition, according to his doctors and lawyers.

The trial has resumed amid speculation that a recent acquittal of policemen tried for killing Egyptian protesters could be a prelude to the dismissal of charges against the ousted leader.

It began on August 3 but has 
since been bogged down in procedural matters, including a demand by 
lawyers for the victims that the presiding judge, Ahmed Rifaat, be 
removed.

That request alone took a separate court about three months to rule on.

Another Cairo court on Thursday 
acquitted five policemen of charges of killing five protesters during 
the uprising in the capital's district of el-Sayedah Zeinab last January
and February.

The
court said three of the defendants were not at the site of the killings
while the other two fired against protesters in self-defence.

The
ruling angered families of the victims. Activists demanded that the 
killers be brought to justice and complained that similar cases are 
languishing in courts in several Egyptian cities.

Also on trial are the ousted leader's former security chief and six top police commanders.

Gamal and Alaa, who also stand accused of corruption, were brought up in the Heliopolis district of Cairo.

Gamal went on to become a banker in London until returning to Egypt in 1995. He climbed up the ranks to lead an influential government committee which instigated liberal economic reforms.

Alaa did not assume such a public role, but was alleged to have used his father's status to become immensely rich through corrupt business enterprises.

The acquittal of the police officers in el-Sayedah Zeinab and the relatively long time the Mubarak trial is taking before even starting to deal with the core of the charges against him have led many activists to brand the proceedings a farce, organised by the generals who took over power when the longtime leader was ousted.

The generals are led by Field Marshal Hussein Tantawi, Mubarak's defence minister for the last 20 years he spent in office.

The activists believe the generals remain beholden to the Mubarak regime, and only placed the former president and his two sons under arrest after mounting pressure by protesters.

The Mubaraks were arrested in April, two months after the ousting of the regime.

Activists believe this was long enough for the three to conceal evidence of their alleged involvement in either the killings or corruption.
