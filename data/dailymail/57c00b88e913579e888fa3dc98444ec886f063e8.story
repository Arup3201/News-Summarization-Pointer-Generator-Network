Portugal find themselves plonked into a genuine Group of Death at the World Cup, but you wouldn't know it.

The pressure appears to be off before they arrive in Brazil, without the expectation of previous tournaments and the squad were grinning from ear-to-ear alongside talisman Cristiano Ronaldo.

Paulo Bento's side face Germany before tricky ties against Ghana and the USA.

All smiles: Portugal posed for a selfie that talisman Cristiano Ronaldo posted online before the World Cup

Holds the key: Ronaldo is Portugal's only world-class performer and needs to set Brazil alight

They scraped through qualification last year after struggling to second place in a group to include Northern Ireland and Luxembourg.

Only Ronaldo's brilliance in a play-off against Sweden saw them progress.

And the Real Madrid star holds the key for the Portuguese if they are to get out of Group G this month.

He has been in consistently stunning form for the Champions League winners over the last two years and needs to carry on if they are to make their mark.

But Ronaldo appeared keen to dismiss any suggestion that they are a one-man team.

'A team representing a country! #ForcaPortugalFollow' he said on his Instagram. At last count the selfie had been liked 525,000 times.Â 

Portugal face Mexico then the Republic of Ireland before kicking off their tournament against Joachim Low's Germans on June 16.

Smile, lads! Paulo Bento's side face Germany, the USA and Ghana in the Group of Death this month
