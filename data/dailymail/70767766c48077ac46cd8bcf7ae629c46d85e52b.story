Wayne Rooney has agreed the fundamental details of his new £300,000-a-week contract at Manchester United but the deal has been held up by haggling over image rights.

It is understood that the United striker and his representatives have declared themselves happy with the fine details of the 28-year-old’s salary and bonus structure.

Making his point: Wayne Rooney should pen a huge £300,000-a-week deal at United in a matter of days

Back: Rooney returned to training on Wednesday after the team's five-day break in Dubai

However, Rooney cannot actually sign the deal until a couple of issues over image rights are ironed out.

United
 chief executive Ed Woodward is confident that can be sorted out over 
the course of Thursday and or Friday and there is still an outside chance
 that confirmation of a new five-and-half-year deal could be made before
 close of play on Friday.

If that doesn’t happen, though, it may have to wait until after United return from Champions League duty in Greece next week.

Keeping up morale: David Moyes has managed to tie Rooney down on a five-year deal

Going nowhere: It looks as though Rooney will see out the remainder of his career at Old Trafford, giving up on his dream of moving to Chelsea

United
 are relaxed about the situation with sources revealing on Wednesday that the 
details of Rooney’s pay and the length of the contact were actually 
sorted out some weeks ago.

They
 want to announce the deal as soon as possible to give the club and its 
manager David Moyes a boost ahead of some important games in the weeks 
to come.

United – seventh in
 the Barclays Premier League and seemingly out of the running for the 
Champions League places – are away at Crystal Palace on Saturday evening
 and then fly to Athens for their Champions League game at Olympiakos.

After that United are away at West Brom, also in the Barclays Premier League.

Break: Rooney's wife Coleen is in Barbados on a holiday with sons Kai and Klay

Say cheese! Coleen and Klay smile for the camera while Wayne finalises his £300k-a-week deal at Old Trafford

Nearly: United executive vice chairman Ed Woodward (left) could complete the deal this week

Turning point? Rooney agreeing to sign a new deal is a major coup for under-fire manager David Moyes
