A family has been reunited with their two missing cocker spaniels after actress and model Liz Hurley lent her support to their Twitter appeal.

Matt and Laura Goodwin feared their beloved pets Ben and Muddles had been taken by dog-nappers after they vanished from their farm.

The couple of St Breward, Cornwall, were terrified the 20-month-old brother and sister had been stolen to order amid a recent surge in thefts of black spaniels.

Cocker spaniels have become a popular choice for families looking for dogs, after the Duchess of Cambridge was seen with her pet dog Lupo.

Mr Goodwin launched a social media campaign to find them and his search got an unexpected boost when celebrity spaniel owner Hurley saw the appeal on Twitter and urged her 376,000 followers to help.

And just six days after their disappearance the puppies were spotted huddling for warmth on the roadside six miles from their home.

Passing motorists recognised them from Liz Hurley's web appeal and reunited the starving pets with their ecstatic owners.

Ms Hurley has several dogs, including Mia, a spaniel.

Mrs Goodwin, 36, an accountant, said she felt 'honoured' that the pet lover urged her huge Twitter following to help find the family's missing puppies.

She said: 'Our children have poured two months of pure love into those two dogs and the thought of them losing their best friends drove us on.

'Frankly, I was prepared to shamelessly exploit any connections we could find. I trawled for celebrities with spaniels and up came Liz Hurley.

'She doesn't do a lot of retweeting, but as soon as Matt messaged her and gave her a link to the website, she could see that this was a genuine, heartfelt campaign.

'We were really honoured and grateful that she retweeted our message.'

The couple had told their children 'white lies' while they searched for the animals, who ran off during a storm on January 28.

After an initial search of the area and an advert in the local paper failed to find the two pets, Matt began spreading the news on Facebook and Twitter.

The search soon went viral when Hurley, 47 - owner of a black spaniel named Mia - saw Mr Goodwin's appeal.

She tweeted: '2 lost Spaniels missing since 28th around stbreward cornwall, please help us find them.'

Their search was also bolstered by dozens of local volunteers - including the police and the Army.

Mr Goodwin said: 'Camelford police kindly started the ball rolling by posting a message on their Facebook site. Twitter then allowed us the opportunity to speak directly with more people.

'We set the dogs up with a website to give more pictures and keep everyone up to date with any news.

Mrs Goodwin, 36, an accountant, said she felt 'honoured' that pet lover Liz urged her huge Twitter following to help find the family's missing puppies because the children had poured 'two months of love into them'

'In the meantime we were searching and visiting places that we thought the dogs could have been and contacting local post offices, schools, pubs, shops and businesses.

'We spoke to anyone we saw, especially dog walkers. We saw the Army training and they agreed to keep an eye out and Bodmin Airfield and their pilots were also looking.

'There is big business in working dogs being stolen. We knew the dogs had run off, as time went on without news there was always the concern they might have been picked up and sold on quickly.

'Our biggest fear was that we would never know what had happened. It was really heart-warming, everybody got involved and people cared enough to share.

'A kind couple had hold of them by the side of the road then another car pulled up. The second couple exchanged all their details and proved their address and ensured our dogs got back to us.'

The dogs have been checked over by vets and are now back home following the ordeal.

Mrs Goodwin added: 'The dogs had lost two kilos, the were very weak and vulnerable. Hadthese people not stopped this story might have had a very different ending.

'The vet has given them a clean bill of health and they are back at home now, totally whacked from their ordeal but making a slow recovery. The children are just thrilled to have them back.'

Pauline Reed, of Kevelek Gundogs in nearby St Austell, Cornwall, said the couple's fears about dog-nappers were well founded.

She said: 'They are being stolen for money but also for breeding and even as bait for dog fighting. There are very well-organised gangs out there.'
