Phony: Elizabeth Hinojosa, 47, is accused of developing a scheme with her daughter in which she pretended to be a dentist and performed procedures on up to 100 unsuspecting patients

Officials in Oklahoma City are searching for two women who they say have been practicing dentistry for several years without a license, targeting mainly Hispanic illegal immigrants. 

Elizabeth Hinojosa, 47, and Monica Salazar Orozco, 28, identified as her daughter, were charged in absentia last Friday with felony practicing dentistry without a license.

Hinojosa also was charged with one count each of forgery, medical battery and embezzlement.Arrest warrants were issued for both women, who remain at large. Hinojosa is believed to be in San Antonio, Texas, where she worked for a dentist until quitting Friday, according to Oklahoma Dentistry Board Executive Director Susan Rogers.

Rogers said on Tuesday that as many as 100 adults and children are believed to have been victimized by Hinojosa and Orozco.

‘This is a Pandora's box,’ Rogers told NewsOK. ‘When we started this, we had no idea how big and bad it was.’

Officials said in a news release that Hinojosa was hired at two Oklahoma City area dental offices owned and operated by Dr Salam Ramadan as a Spanish translator and part-time dental assistant.

Instead, the 47-year-old woman and her daughter, who have no known dental training, had allegedly come up with a scheme in which patients were given follow-up appointments set for times when the dentist offices were closed, according to officials.

Scheme: Hinojosa was hired at two Oklahoma City area dental offices owned and operated by Dr Salam Ramadan as a Spanish translator and part-time dental assistant

The duo would then allegedly tell the patients Hinojosa was a dentist and would do the work at a lower price if they paid cash. It is believed that the women targeted undocumented immigrants since they would be more reluctant to file complaints if something went awry.

Hinojosa allegedly performed dental extractions, fillings, bridges, root canals and other procedures. Investigators have identified 22 adults and children who had used Hinojosa’s services. 

Hinojosa, also known as ‘Dr. Liz’ to the victims, was a dental assistant and her daughter was a receptionist where the alleged crimes took place between September 2010 and May 2011, according to a probable cause affidavit filed with the charges.

Stolen smile: Carroll Jarrett, of Andarako, said the two front teeth that Hinojosa had installed fell out when he bit on a piece of chicken

One of the pair’s alleged victims was Carroll Jarrett, of Andarako, who paid Hinojosa $6,000 in hopes of regaining his smile after he had lost his two front teeth in a bicycle accident years earlier.

But when Jarrett bit into a piece of fried chicken on the Fourth of July, his two new teeth fell out.

‘It was gross,’ Jarrett told NewsOK. ‘I had two little bitty nubs where my smile was.’

The patient also said that Hinojosa installed braces for his teenage daughter, which came apart a short time later. When the Anadarko man returned to the office where he received treatment to complain, Hinojosa was nowhere to be found, and the dentist who was there had no record of his previous visit.

Dr Ramadan, who hired Hinojosa and her daughter, said she was not aware of her employees' alleged crimes until she was contacted by officials.

The director of the Oklahoma Dentistry Board said Ramadan is not suspected of any wrongdoing in the case.

Dangerous ruse: Hinojosa allegedly performed dental extractions, fillings, bridges, root canals and other procedures on patients, one of who contracted hepatitis C

Rogers said the dentist did not speak any Spanish and relied on Hinojosa and/or her daughter to translate for all patients during procedures and to set appointments.

But the two women allegedly went a step further, scheduling appointments after hours and forwarding office calls to their personal numbers.

Rogers said she is concerned about the health of the victims. At least one unidentified patient has contracted hepatitis C following a dental procedure performed by Hinojosa.
