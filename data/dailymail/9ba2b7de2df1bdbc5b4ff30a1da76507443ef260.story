Shocking footage has emerged from inside a Florida classroom showing a girl being paddled by her teacher as three or four male students hold her down.

However the parents of the girl - now 18 -  have limited legal options to pursue after signing a corporal punishment permission form when their daughter started at the institution.

The disturbing incident occurred at Zarephath Academy, a Christian school in Jacksonville.

'Once they got me, they flip me over and grab me by my arms and my legs,' the girl, identified as Roshada Smith, told News4Jax.
