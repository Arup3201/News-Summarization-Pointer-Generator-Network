Fiona Woolf is the second person to be appointed to lead the Government's child abuse inquiry 

Fiona Woolf last night faced renewed pressure to stand down as the head of the Government’s child abuse inquiry after victims said they will no longer participate because of her links to Leon Brittan.

As evidence emerged of yet more undisclosed meetings between Mrs Woolf and Lord Brittan, a key figure in the scandal, child abuse survivors said they had lost confidence in the inquiry.

A lawyer for almost 50 victims said some would now boycott the hearings as they feel they will not be listened to.

Lord Brittan is accused of being at the centre of an Establishment cover-up of sex abuse claims in the 1980s – a charge he strenuously denies. It is alleged that, when he was Home Secretary, he ignored a document – which later went missing – that described a paedophile ring involving high-profile figures.

Mrs Woolf, who was appointed last month to lead the investigation, wrote a letter to the current Home Secretary, Theresa May, to list her possible conflicts of interests, in which she detailed her contact with Lord Brittan and his wife, including five dinner parties.

But yesterday it emerged that Mrs Woolf, who lives in the same street at Lord Brittan, hosted a VIP drinks reception at which he was a guest, which she had not declared in her list.

According to a City of London newsletter, Mrs Woolf and Tory peer Lord Brittan were among only a handful of dignitaries to meet the French prime minister at an intimate event in 2011.

Andi Lavery, a child abuse victim, said the inquiry was now ‘nonsense’ and called for the home affairs select committee to hold a hearing to listen to survivors’ concerns.

He said: ‘This whole process has become an insult and we will not engage with Woolf. Her position is untenable, they have made an absolute mess of this. Survivors who want to be listened to are in despair. This is hurting people. We have a right to a fair hearing, but how can we know we will get this if they [Mrs Woolf and Lord Brittan] go drinking together?’

Mrs Woolf told the home affairs committee she had gone the 'extra distance' to explain her relationship with Lord Brittan - but yesterday it emerged that she hosted a VIP drinks reception at which he was a guest

Last Tuesday, Mrs Woolf, a corporate lawyer, told the home affairs committee: ‘I have gone the extra distance to make sure I have dug out any possible connection [to Lord Brittan].’

Within 24 hours, a photograph emerged that showed Mrs Woolf with Lord Brittan’s wife at an awards ceremony in October 2013, despite Mrs Woolf claiming she had had no social contact with the Brittans since April 2013.

Last night Alison Millar, a partner at Leigh Day law firm who represents nearly 50 of the alleged victims, said: ‘Fiona Woolf is a distinguished figure, but rather than bringing any background in child protection to this inquiry, she brings connections to a key figure, Lord Brittan.

‘Some of my more vocal clients have said they feel the correct thing to do is turn their backs on the inquiry as it is.

In 1983 Lord Brittan, above, was handed a file that allegedly detailed abuse at the highest levels of Westminster

‘When many survivors tried to complain about their abuse they have not been listened to, and now they feel the same is happening again. There was a lot of optimism when the inquiry was announced that the authorities wanted to hear and learn lessons.

‘They now feel with the way it’s been set up the establishment does not want to hear too many inconvenient truths.’

Mrs Woolf is the second person to be appointed to lead the inquiry. The first, Baroness Butler-Sloss, was forced to quit because her late brother was the Attorney General at the time of some of the alleged abuse in the 1980s.

Mrs Woolf, who is also Lord Mayor of London, did not respond to a request to comment last night.
