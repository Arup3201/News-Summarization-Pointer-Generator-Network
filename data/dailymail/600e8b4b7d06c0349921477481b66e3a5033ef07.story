No surprises: Unmarried mothers to be, those on lower incomes and the less well educated were more likely to want to know their baby's sex

Unmarried mothers-to-be, those on a lower income and the less well educated are more likely to want to know the sex of their unborn baby, suggests a new study.

Researchers in the U.S. also found those same women had unrealistically high standards of parenting compared to mothers who were not determined to know the sex before birth.

They believe their findings show women who choose not to know the sex of their baby may be more open to new experiences and have more egalitarian views about gender in society.

Researchers looked at 182 expectant mothers, of whom around two-thirds knew the sex of their child, measuring aspects of their personality, gender role beliefs and expectations related to parenting perfectionism.

Mothers who chose to know the sex of their child tended to be less educated, have lower household incomes and were less likely to be married than women who did not know.

Expectant mothers who scored high in parenting perfectionism, meaning they set unrealistically high standards, were also slightly more likely to find out the sex early.

On the other hand, women who scored high in 'openness to experience', suggesting they were curious and independent, were less inclined to learn their baby's sex.

The strongest effect was a combination of conscientiousness with the belief that women and men should share parenting roles. Participants with this combination of traits were 87 per cent less likely than others to want to know their child's sex before birth.

Co-author Doctor Sarah Schoppe-Sullivan said: 'A conscientious, egalitarian expectant mother may want to wait to find out the sex of the baby because she doesn't want to create an environment that reinforces old gender stereotypes.'

Lead author Letitia Kotila, a graduate student in human sciences at Ohio State University, said: 'An expectant mother who chooses to find out her child's sex before birth may be giving subtle clues about her views on proper gender roles.

'The results suggest women who choose not to learn their baby's sex may not worry about having clothes, toys and colours for their child that match traditional gender expectations.

'We don't know this for sure yet, but expectant mothers' choice on whether to find out their baby's sex may show gender role attitudes that will shape how they raise their children.'

Everything must be perfect: Expectant mothers who scored high in parenting perfectionism, meaning they set unrealistically high standards, were also slightly more likely to find out the sex early

Ms Kotila said: 'These women may be more willing to let their pregnancy unfold naturally and not feel the need for tests to reveal the child's sex.'

Dr Schoppe-Sullivan said this study is just a starting point for larger questions about the implications that knowing a child's sex may have for future parenting.

She said: 'If you know ahead of time that you're having a girl, are you layering on all the pink and purple in a way that is going to push an extremely feminine ideal on your child?

'This may affect what paths a girl thinks is appropriate, all the way to what kind of careers she considers.'
