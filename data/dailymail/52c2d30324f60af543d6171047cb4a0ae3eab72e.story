In a world already full of road hogs this is perhaps the last thing you want to see in the rear view mirror.

Animal experts are teaching dogs how to drive.

Astonishingly, it took three mutts just eight weeks to master the basics in wooden carts.

In just eight weeks, Porter progressed to driving a real car

Monty, who is 18 months old, in one of the specially built training cars

Ginnie, a one year old Beardie Whippet Cross, is the third driver in the group

The three dogs will drive a  modified Mini in which they sit on their haunches in the driver’s seat with their paws on the steering wheel.

Their
 feet go on extension levers which had been attached to the accelerator 
and the brake whilst their paw will rest on the gearstick.

They then graduated to a modified 
Mini in which they sat on their haunches in the driver's seat with their
 paws on the steering wheel. Their feet go on extension levers which are
 attached to the accelerator and the brake while their paw rests on the 
gearstick.

An animal welfare group in New 
Zealand trained the dogs to get behind the wheel in an attempt to show 
the public how intelligent they are.

The Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals will put them to the test in a live broadcast next Monday.

The dogs have been trained in specially made wooden carts which they have been driving around inside an indoor test lab.

Mark Vette, the animal trainer who is schooling the dogs, said in a preview of the show that they treated the training like a ‘film shoot’, in reference to his work in the movies.

He said: ‘We train the dogs to do different actions, touch is the first thing and then we teach them to touch the different objects with the right paw and left paw.

‘They’ve all come through at this point and they’re all going really well’.

The
 dogs that were chosen were Porter, a 10-month old Beardie Cross, Monty,
 an 18-month-old Schnauzer Cross, and Ginny, a one-year-old Beardie 
Whippet Cross.

The dogs were all rescued by the Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals in Auckland, New Zealand

All of them had been rescued by the SPCA.

The organisation hopes that the public will be so impressed with the animals that they will adopt them and others like them.

SPCA Auckland Chief executive Christine Kalin said: ‘I think sometimes people think because they're getting an animal that's been abandoned that somehow it's a second-class animal.

‘The dogs have achieved amazing things in eight short weeks of training, which really shows with the right environment just how much potential all dogs from the SPCA have as family pets.’
