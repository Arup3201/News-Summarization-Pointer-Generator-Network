Soap operas are to blame for encouraging teenagers to drink, warns a report.

Some of the nation’s best-loved programmes including Coronation Street and EastEnders are littered with so many references to alcohol that they are a ‘major source of exposure’ for children and young people.

The study  found 92 per cent of episodes contain some form of alcohol imagery including drinking, bottle branding and scenes in the Rovers Return and Queen Vic.

Research also revealed drink was a recurring theme every nine minutes on terrestrial channels during the evening. Alcohol use was highest in soap operas, closely followed by feature films, says the report published in the Journal of Public Health.

The greatest amount of alcohol content was in the hour immediately before the 9pm watershed. The study, by researchers at Nottingham University and King’s College London, is the first for nearly two decades to document alcohol content during prime time on the five most popular terrestrial TV channels.

The researchers said: ‘Our findings demonstrate that prime-time television is a major source of exposure to alcohol imagery among children, and as such is likely to be contributing to uptake and consumption of alcohol among young people in the UK.

‘Tighter regulation of advertising and promotion of alcoholic drinks, including promotion through sporting events, has been proposed to reduce [such] consumption.

‘We suggest that such measures should include television programme content as well as advertising, particularly before the 9pm watershed.’

They added: ‘Episodes of alcohol branding comprised advertising, such as billboards, branded products such as bottles visible behind a bar or held or used in a scene and branded items such as umbrellas or clothing.’

The study examined more than 400 broadcasting hours between 6pm and 10pm, including adverts.

The researchers said it was ‘surprising’ to see real brands of alcohol alongside fictitious branding in TV pubs. The study found that 92 per cent of soap episodes carried alcohol imagery compared to 86 per cent of feature films, and sport and comedy,  both 63 per cent.

The study led Alcohol Concern to call for the appointment of an alcohol advertising regulator.

But ITV spokesman Alison Sinclair insisted alcohol imagery in programmes is taken seriously.

‘Real advertising brand names never feature and the focus is on the drama in a small community and on the dialogue amongst the characters in the pub as opposed to alcohol intake,’ she said.

BBC spokesman Joanna Allen added: ‘Any alcoholic drink bought or consumed by a character in EastEnders will always be a fictitious brand. Any use of branded alcohol is purely for background dressing.’ 

Last year, the World Health Organisation found that binge drinking among British teenage girls was the worst in Europe. More than half of all 15 and 16-year-olds admit to getting drunk at least once a month.
