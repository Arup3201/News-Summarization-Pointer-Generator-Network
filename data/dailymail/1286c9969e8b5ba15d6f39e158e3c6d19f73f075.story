Despite many of Ashley Taylor Dawson’s fans being devastated at his elimination from Strictly Come Dancing on Sunday, it seems his family may welcome the end of his grueling schedule.

The Hollyoaks star, whose long term partner Karen McKay gave birth to their second child Mason Mac in October, has confessed that combining filming Hollyoaks with his Strictly rehearsals has meant he has been too busy to bond with his new son.

Speaking to Attitude magazine Ashley said being parted from his family was ‘the hardest thing’ about taking part in the intense dancing competition.

He
 said: ‘When I get up at 7am, I get to see my little boy and my new baby
 for a little while, but that’s about it really. I feel really guilty 
about not being there with my family, I hate it. “Daddy go to work now” 
is all I ever hear from my little boy at the moment.'

‘I haven’t really bonded with my baby yet. My fiancée Karen has just been incredible – she’s really holding the fort. It’s an overwhelming time in any parent’s life taking on another child and she’s doing it all on her own at the moment.’

Describing the last few months actor Ashley, who lives in Manchester, said that he has been lucky to get five hours sleep a night: ‘It’s full on. I’m in work [at 
Hollyoaks] at 8am every morning and yesterday I didn’t finish filming 
until 8.30pm. Then I went straight to the dance studio for 9.15pm and 
trained until 1.15am. And
 then I drove home, learned my lines and was back at Hollyoaks again at 
8am. That’s my normal Monday to Thursday at the moment.’

Ashley Taylor Dawson and Ola Jordan were eliminated from Strictly on Sunday night following a dance off with Patrick Robinson and Anya Garnis

Ashley and Ola's conga was not enough to save them

The couple, who have been together for 
nine years, also have a two-year-old son Buddy Mac, who had been 
following his father's progress with interest.

Ashley said: ‘He’s actually getting a bit obsessed with it. He watches my routines over and over on his mum’s phone and then copies the moves himself, it’s hilarious!

'And he calls me Ashley Taylor Dawson now, he won’t call me daddy. He’s like, “Ashley Taylor Dawson! Ashley Taylor Dawson!’ And I’m like, “No, you can’t call me that, I’m your dad.’

The 31-year-old star and his partner Ola Jordan faced Sunday night’s dance-off for the second week in a row after dancing the Salsa to Gloria Estefan’s Conga, but lost out to Patrick Robinson and his partner Anya Garnis.

However, the intensive dancing has obviously paid off when it comes to Ashley’s’ physique.

The soap star strips off for the photoshoot accompanying his interview in Attitude, displaying his defined torso in low slung jeans and boxer shorts.

And despite his recent sleep deprivation Ashley shows no sign of fatigue as he gazes seductively into the camera.

His good looks have in fact caused fellow cast member Kieron Richardson to describe him as the sexiest member of the Hollyoaks troupe.

Kieron was recently quoted as saying : ‘Whenever he comes out of the shower, I’m there thinking, just take the towel off! Just take the towel off!’

And Ashley clearly isn’t phased by such adoration, simply saying: ‘I love Kieron so it makes me feel very, very happy.  If I was ever to turn gay Kieron would be my man.’
