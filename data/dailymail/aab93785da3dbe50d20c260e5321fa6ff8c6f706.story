A leading academic was today told the allegations that she stalked one of the world's top economists would be dismissed - as she vowed to sue him in revenge.

Heleen Mees said that she wanted compensation from Willem Buiter, the chief economist at Citigroup, for the loss of her professional reputation and the stress she had endured.

Her lawyers also vowed to sue Citigroup to demand emails relating to ‘dates’ between them both to see if Mr Buiter may have lied to police. Citigroup declined to comment on the case.

Dropped: Heleen Mees was told in court today that the stalking charges against her will be dropped

Sentence:  Miss Mees was told her case would be dismissed in a year if she attends 14 therapy sessions and stays out of trouble

Not quite the end: Miss Mees said that she wanted compensation from Willem Buiter, the chief economist at Citigroup, for the loss of her professional reputation and the stress she had endured

Today at Manhattan’s Criminal Court Miss Mees was told her case would be dismissed in a year if she attends 14 therapy sessions and stays out of trouble.

Under the deal she does not admit guilt to the five charges of stalking and harassment.

Speaking after the case her lawyer Olav Haazen said that since her arrest, Miss Mees was sacked from her job as Adjunct Associate Professor at New York University’s Robert F. Wagner Graduate School of Public Policy.

Mss Mees was seen with a black leather Chanel purse emblazoned with the fashion house's distinctive label. The exact model of the bag is not clear, but this year's version retails for $3,700.

Compensation: Mees, seen holding a Chanel bag which normally retails for upwards of $3,000, said she will sue Citigroup to demand emails relating to ¿dates¿ between them both to see if Mr Buiter may have lied to police

Subject: The ruling brings an end to a messy case that exposed the personal lives of Miss Mees, 44, and Cambridge-educated Mr Buiter, 64, who used to be on the Bank of England¿s Monetary Policy Committee, which sets interest rates

She has also lost her consulting business and is no longer writing for a number of prestigious newspapers in Holland.

Mr Haazen said: ‘All that was taken away from her on the basis of accusations which turned out to be not viable for a criminal case.

'You can imagine when all that is taken away...the damages both financially and emotionally are significant.’

Mr Haazen added that the lawsuit against Citigroup he would file in the Manhattan Federal Court would force the company to hand over emails relating to meetings between Miss Mees and Mr Buiter.

There was a ‘significant likelihood’ a lawsuit against Mr Buiter himself would follow, he said.

The
 ruling brings an end to a messy case that exposed the personal lives of
 Miss Mees, 44, and Cambridge-educated Mr Buiter, 64, who used to be on 
the Bank of England’s Monetary Policy Committee, which sets interest 
rates.

Dutch-born Miss Mees 
was accused of sending him more than 3,000 sexually explicit and 
threatening emails and Facebook messages over a four-year period.

She also allegedly followed him to China and Amsterdam, where she used a fake name to try and get into his hotel.

Positive outcome: Mees, seen entering court on Monday, maintained that she was not stalking him but their messages and explicit emails went both ways

Thankful: Mees took to Twitter to thank her family, legal team and supporters after the ruling

Among the messages were some relating to sex acts and naked pictures of herself.

Papers filed with the Manhattan court brings to light more details about the intimate relationship that Mees and Buiter shared, revealing that he called himself 'ELB' which stood for Enema Loving Brit.

He also apparently told Mees that he would leave his wife to be with her.

His wife, Anne, is said to have learned about the affair in 2009- prompting them to break it off.

The court documents reveal that Buiter told his wife that it was over but began seeing Mees again shortly after.

Along with their more explicit emails, they also had lighter moments at Anne's expense.

'Can't you send Anne shopping with your Citi credit card so we can have some time alone? Imagine what we can do in under an hour,' Mees wrote in one email.

Looking ahead: Mees is seeking compensation because the court drama resulted in the loss of her consulting business and is no longer writing for a number of prestigious newspapers in Holland

Moving on: Dutch-born Miss Mees was accused of sending him more than 3,000 sexually explicit and threatening emails and Facebook messages over a four-year period

But there were also more sinister messages too such as one which read: ‘I hope you die (read this to your wife)’.

Another was a picture of some dead birds next to which she wrote: 'I hope your plane falls out the sky'.

Threatened: Mees allegedly sent harassing messages' to Buiter's wife, economics professor Anne Sibert (pictured), and the couple's two children

Miss Mees claimed all along that she and 
Mr Buiter, who is married to his second wife, economics professor Anne 
Sibert, were having an affair and that it was a 'bilateral' arrangement.

Her lawyers argued that the relationship was ‘encouraged on social media and in person' as well by Mr Buiter, who was born in Holland but has British and American citizenship.

During one hearing Mr Buiter was even scolded by a judge for contacting Miss Mees on business networking website LinkedIn weeks after she was arrested

Mr Buiter is based in London but has a $4million flat on Manhattan's Upper West Side.

Mr Buiter, who was not in court, said in the criminal complaint: ‘The defendant's actions have caused me severe annoyance and alarm, and to fear for my physical safety and for the safety of my wife and my children.’

Speaking outside court Miss Mees' lawyer Ira London said she was 'delighted' with the verdict.

He said: 'We were always confident that her innocence would prevail and it has.

'The 14 weeks of therapy are mutually agreed upon because of the stress this case has caused Miss Mees.'

He declined to comment on her feelings towards Mr Buiter.
