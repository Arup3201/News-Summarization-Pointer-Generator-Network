Tyson Fury is adamant he will not step foot in the same ring as British heavyweight rival Dereck Chisora in future after the Londoner pulled out of their scheduled fight this Saturday.

The duo were set to settle their differences at the Phones 4 U Arena in Manchester this weekend, but Chisora pulled out of the rematch, which was billed as a final eliminator for the WBO title, on Monday.

Stand in: Tyson Fury (left) will face Alexander Ustinov on Saturday after British rival Dereck Chisora pulled out

While promoter Frank Warren insists Fury is contractually locked in to a rearranged date in October, the 6ft 9in Manchester fighter insists he wants to face WBC champion Bermane Stiverne if he gets past Chisora's stand-in opponent Alexander Ustinov.

'As far as I'm concerned Dereck Chisora is history - finished,' Fury, who also saw David Haye twice pull out of a fight with him last year due to separate injuries, said.

'After I've done with this lummox in front of me (Ustinov) I want Bermane Stiverne for the WBC title.

'I'm not interested in Dereck Chisora, he ain't got enough credibility to lace my boots up, never mind step in the same ring. He's a s***house who dropped his b******s in training.

'Chisora is another David Haye - a wannabe. A wannabe Tyson Fury opponent in hindsight who realises the daunting task ahead and decides I'll live to fight another day rather than get annihilated.

'I want to fight real fighters who want to fight. I started in a career in boxing to be involved in good fights, for people to say "yes (he) fought good fighters and didn't pick and choose".'

Ustinov is a much different proposition to Chisora, standing seven inches taller, at 6ft 8in, and some four stones heavier.

More importantly, he has lost only once in his 29 fights to date, and that came against Kubrat Pulev in September 2012 in an IBF eliminator bout.

However, Fury (22-0, 16KOs) says he had no intention of disappointing the paying fans and is keen to fight on Saturday, even if it comes at a great risk to his unbeaten record.

Dangerous: Ustinov has both the reach and power and has lost just one of his 29 fights

'I'm not about to let people down especially in my home town, I don't care if he (Frank Warren) brought King Kong to me on Saturday night I was going to fight,' said Fury.

'Most people would have got a journeyman to fight, I don't do that. This guy is rated number 10 in the world by two organisations, he's not a pushover.

'I've had no sparring and no preparation. It's a real 50/50 fight, it's about who gets who out of there.

Injury: Dereck Chisora (left) pulled out of the rematch after injuring his hand

'People like Dereck Chisora and David Haye are conning people, they're out to con the public and the British Boxing Board of Control say I'm bad for boxing!

'When I say I'm going to fight, I fight. I would fight with no eyes. There was nothing going to keep me out of that ring on Saturday.

'For him (Chisora) to have another little injury and pull out is absolutely pathetic. It's a disgrace to the world of heavyweight boxing.'
