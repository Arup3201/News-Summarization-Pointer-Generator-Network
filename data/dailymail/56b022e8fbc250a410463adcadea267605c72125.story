Jailed: Peter Ramsey given 12 years in prison for raping and assaulting a woman after he met on the online dating website plentyoffish.com

A rapist who beat a legal secretary and left her ‘unrecognisable’ at the end of their first date was jailed for 12 years yesterday.

Peter Ramsey, 26, punched the woman to the ground, ripped her clothing and raped her when she refused him a goodnight kiss at her front door.

He knocked out one of her front teeth and left her with 21 injuries as he ran off with her underwear as a trophy.

He was caught after using the victim’s Oyster travelcard to board a night bus within minutes of the attack in Clapham, south-west London, Inner London Crown Court heard.

Judge Patricia Lees told Ramsey: ‘The gratuitous violence was wholly unnecessary. It severely aggravates the rape.’

Ramsey and the woman had spent four days chatting on the PlentyofFish.com dating site before they arranged to meet for drinks in Brixton.

Ramsey was using a false name as he was cheating on his girlfriend.

The victim later said: ‘He seemed like a nice guy. I thought we had a lot in common.’

They arrived at her flat in the early hours of August 27 last year but when he lent in for a kiss and she pulled back, he ‘switched’.

In the communal entrance to the block, he pinned her against the wall and rained punches on her face.

Ramsey met his victim on the online dating website plentyoffish.com, which claims to be 'responsible for more relationships than any other dating site', but attacked her when she refused a goodnight kiss on their first date

When she screamed he used one hand to cover her mouth and pinch her nose, while hitting her with the other fist. 'I thought I was going to die,’ she told the court.

Ramsey, of no fixed address, who had been staying with friends in Forest Hill, south-east London, claimed he and the woman had consensual sex and said he did not need to rape because he could get anyone he wanted.

Ramsey denied the charges but was found guilty by a jury at Inner London Crown Court in Southwark

He was convicted of rape, wounding with intent to cause grievous bodily harm and theft.

Lesley Manley, defending, said Ramsey’s girlfriend had decided to stay with him and had been his only visitor in prison.

Detective Constable Richard Huggins said later: ‘I would urge people using dating websites to vet the people they meet before they spend time alone.’
