'Deep feelings': Delta Ferneyhough was jailed for two years for reciprocating the teenager's advances

A teaching assistant who had sex with a 'besotted' 15-year-old pupil has been jailed for two years.

Delta Ferneyhough corrupted the teenager 'with some vigour' by exchanging sexual messages, videos and photos with him, culminating in an illicit meeting at her home in Cleethorpes, Grimsby.

The 28-year-old was discovered when the mother of the boy found a text from Ferneyhough which said 'Hi gorgeous'.

Confronted by his mother with the evidence, he confessed he and his teaching assistant had sex.

The boy's mother threatened to report Ferneyhough to the school where she worked, which cannot be named for legal reasons, unless she resigned her post.

Ferneyhough would not resign, and once alerted the school told police and suspended her from her duties. She was later sacked.

Jeremy Evans, prosecuting, told the court that the boy had a 'crush' on her and suffered serious emotional harm from the relationship.

The teaching assistant admitted one count of sexual activity with a child in breach of a position of trust, and one count of causing or inciting a child to engage in sexual activity.

She was placed on the sex offenders' register for 10 years and handed a 10-year Sexual Offences Prevention Order, which severely restricts her future contact with boys under 16 and her use of the internet.

Judge David Tremberg told Grimsby Crown Court: 'This defendant crossed a red line. She has contributed to corrupting this boy.

'There canâ€™t be a teacher or teaching assistant in England who does not know that engaging in sexual activity with a pupil is a fundamental breach of trust.'

The judge said her conduct was 'profoundly inappropriate' and she 'led this young man on'.

'You were fully aware of your responsibilities and the procedures and protocols in place to ensure that children were safeguarded from staff,' he told her.

Jailed: Grimsby Crown Court heard the boy may have been 'enthusiastic' to have sex with the teaching assistant but she committed a profound breach of trust. She said she was 'utterly ashamed' of her behaviour

'You were the adult. You were in a position of authority and responsibility. What you did was wholly wrong and you well knew it from first to last.

'You were content to use him to fulfil needs in you.'

'Wholly wrong': A police mugshot of Ferneyhough

Katya Saudek, defending, told the court Ferneyhough had developed 'deep feelings' for the boy but was now 'utterly ashamed of her behaviour' and had paid a heavy price, losing her career.

The court was told Ferneyhough had suffered abuse in previous relationships and the boy had been the 'first person who had been nice to her'.

The judge conceded the boy may have been 'not just willing but enthusiastic' to have sex with her, but added: 'These laws exist to protect young people from themselves as much as they exist to protect them from predatory adults.

'This offending is so serious that only an immediate custodial sentence is appropriate for it.'

PC Jayne Horsfall from Humberside 
Police said: 'This sentence sends a clear message out that Humberside 
Police will always take this type of allegation seriously and with 
specially trained officers, we will seek to support victims and their 
families throughout the investigation process and through to the court 
appearance.

'This has 
been a difficult time for the victim and his family and I would like to 
thank them for their cooperation. As a parent, you should be able to 
expect your children to obtain their education without fear of being 
manipulated and taken advantage of.

'It
 should be noted that the school acted most appropriately in suspending 
and later dismissing Ferneyhough as soon as this allegation came to 
light.

'Throughout this investigation, Ferneyhough refused to answer any questions regarding the victim or the allegations in question.

'The victim in this case is now moving on with his life, with the support of his family.'
