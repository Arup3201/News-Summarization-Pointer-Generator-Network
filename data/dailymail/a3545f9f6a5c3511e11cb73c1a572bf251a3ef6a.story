The man being investigated following the death of a female tourist who fell from his apartment balcony reportedly sent another young woman a 'creepy' message that 'insinuated violence' after they brushed paths on dating app Tinder last year.

Gable Tostee, 28, made contact with Stephanie Angus  on Tinder and sent her the alarming message 10 months ago.

'The first message was "Roses are red, violets are blue. I have a gun. Now get in my van" and I thought looking back it was quite creepy,' Ms Angus told A Current Affair.

Ms Angus, who works as a producer in Sydney for the Channel Nine program, said she stopped messaging Mr Tostee soon after receiving this message

'It was quite a scary thing for him to have written to me. It was quite a strange thing and it insinuated violence and that's quite a worry.'

Ms Angus, who works as a producer in Sydney for the Channel Nine program, said she stopped messaging Mr Tostee soon after.

'I found him to be a bit sleazy and he wasn't the type of bloke I was looking to meet. He was on there for one reason and I was on there for another reason,' she said.

Warriena Tagpuno Wright, 26, died on Friday after she was last seen on the balcony of Mr Tostee's 14th floor home at the Avalon Apartment complex on the Gold Coast.

The New Zealand tourist reportedly met him on Tinder during her holiday to Australia.

Mr Tostee has been in the spotlight since police started investigating Ms Wright's death. Witnesses claim to have heard loud screaming and raised voices coming from the 14th floor on Friday.

Ms Angus said her best friend in Brisbane had also made contact with Mr Tostee on Tinder around the same time as her last year.

'When we both realised it was him after seeing his photo, we were both extremely worried. It was quite a scary thing to read about,' she said.

'It does concern me that I was in contact with him because it could have been me. He came across as the sort of guy that's just out there to pick up girls.'

Ms Angus said he has been back on Tinder in the days following Ms Wright's death.

'He must have more things going on in his life, most important issues that checking who he's been matched with on a dating site,' she said.

Mr Tostee so far hasn't provided police with information about what happened when Ms Wright fell to her death, but Detective Superintendent Dave Hutchinson said they have obtained statements from 'a number of women'.

Detetctives have also interviewed his parents Gray and Helene Tostee at their home in a gated community in Carrara, west of the Gold Coast tourist strip.

'He has exercised his right to silence, ' Mr Hutchinson told Daily Mail Australia.

Supt Hutchinson said a 'forensic procedure order' had been carried out against Tostee,  which is believed to have included blood samples and a DNA swab.

Asked whether Mr Tostee was a person of interest in the case, Mr Hutchinson said, 'obviously we are investigating the circumstances of the death of a young lady who fell from the balcony of his unit.

'He is going to be part of that investigation.'

His lawyer, Michael Purcell, said his client would not be making a statement to police in the foreseeable future.

But Mr Tostee took to a body building forum three times on Monday to talk about the investigation.

At 10.21am, he wrote on the forum, 'I've been advised not to go into details but all I will say is that I absolutely did NOT cause this girl to fall and that I am devastated about what happened to her'.

Police were at the 14th floor of the Avalon Apartments on the Gold Coast on Tuesday as part of their investigation

11.18am: 'Fact is I’ve taken home probably about 150 girls from clubs over the last few years. When you go out often to the same places and get drunk and talk to girls you’re bound to get noticed and hated on, and people gossip.

'Eventually it turns into Chinese whispers where people have a completely false impression of you.

'Most people who know me have been completely supportive, it's those who don't know me at all who assume the worst.'

Thirteen minutes later, at 11.31am, he added, 'My reputation has already been destroyed without me saying anything at all. It’s nothing I haven’t already posted in this thread, but that’s all I have to say for now.'
