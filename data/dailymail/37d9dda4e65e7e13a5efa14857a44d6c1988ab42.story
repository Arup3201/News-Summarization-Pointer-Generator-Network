Alan Pardew has called on his Newcastle players to ‘stand up and deliver’ as he prepares for a hostile afternoon at St James’ Park with one protest group having printed 35,000 cards demanding he be sacked.

The Magpies – beaten 4-0 at Southampton last weekend to leave them propping up the Premier League table - face Hull City on Saturday.

Before the match the people behind the website sackpardew.com will attempt to distribute the A4 cards calling for the manager to be dismissed.

They hope the cards – and upwards of 200 anti-Pardew banners – will then be displayed inside the stadium. Tyneside-based firm printnortheast told Sportsmail they were happy to provide the 35,000 cards free of charge in support of the protest. 

However, we understand the demonstration will not force owner Mike Ashley into ending Pardew’s four-year tenure and he will be given time to turn results around, regardless of the outcome against Hull.

The Newcastle boss, though, wants his under-performing players to snap from their early-season slumber and ease the pressure on himself this weekend.

‘I don’t know about patience, this is a time to stand up and deliver really,’ said Pardew when asked if his side – with seven summer signings – needed time to gel.

‘Saturday is an important game for us because we’ve had a difficult start.

‘Even if we’d got a point (at Southampton) it would have been an okay start because I think we’ve had some tough games.

‘But now we have a game at home where the pressure is really going to be on us. We have to deliver.’

Pardew says that he takes responsibility for the start which has seen United pick up just two points from four games, as he reflected on the horror show at St.Mary’s during which fans chanted throughout for him to go.

‘It was a tough day to take,’ he said. ‘As a group and individually we’re better than that, and I take responsibility for that.

‘It was a heavy defeat when we were looking for so much more. It was a tough day for our fans, a tough day for the team and, certainly, a tough day for me.’

Newcastle conceded inside the first minute in their last home game – a 3-3 draw with Crystal Palace – and also fell behind early at Southampton.

A repeat on Saturday would intensify the poisonous atmosphere which is already anticipated.

And Pardew went on: ‘We have spoken about how important making a good start is.

‘But that’s something that we can’t do. We conceded very early against Crystal Palace as well.

‘That will put us on our guard for Saturday to make sure it’s something we do (start well).

‘The worry (also) is how many goals are we going to score? We’re aware of that. We need to find a formula which will get us some goals.’
