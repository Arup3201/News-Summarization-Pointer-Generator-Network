Lollipop lady Karin Williams, 50, has told how she used her body as a human shield 'out of instinct' to protect children being mowed down by a runaway car outside a school in South Wales

Cardiff Magistrates' Court heard that Robert William Bell, 62, who was driving the M-reg Audi A4 convertible, had been coughing at the wheel moments before veering 
across the road. His car flipped over on speed bump outside the primary 
school.

The court heard how 
his car sent young children 'cartwheeling through the air' and inches 
from death at 8.50am during the school run crash.

Bell denies driving without due care and attention.

He said he suddenly blacked out and then the next thing he knew he was upside down inside the vehicle.

However, 50-year-old Mrs Williams - who has been helping youngsters to cross the road safely for the past 10 years - insisted the defendant was conscious moments before the accident.

In a statement read aloud to the court, she said: 'It was a normal morning. I started at 8am to assist the children going to the school’s breakfast club.

'At 8.50am I was opposite the school helping children to cross the road when all of a sudden, I looked to my left, and saw a dark coloured car coming straight in my direction at speed.

'It was coming at an angle and was on the wrong side of the road.

Ms Williams suffered a catalogue of injuries after jumping in front of the vehicle outside Rhws Junior School, in Rhoose, the Vale of Glamorgan, South Wales, last year

'I remember seeing the man behind the steering wheel. His eyes were open and his hands were gripping the steering wheel tight.

'I think I shouted something to warn the kids and jumped in their direction to try and get them out of the way.

'The next thing I remember is being underneath the car.'

District Judge Bodfan Jenkins was told on June 20, last year, Bell’s car had been driving as normal and keeping to the 20mph speed limit before suddenly accelerating.

The 2.6 litre engine car, which had more than 160,000 miles on the clock, then suddenly veered across the road and hit parents and pupils before colliding with a bollard and sliding on its roof - dragging Mrs Williams in the process - before coming to a standstill.

Five children and four adults were injured in the crash outside the primary school in Rhoose, South Wales, last June.

Ms Williams was left with broken legs, elbow, shoulder and ribs in the crash outside the school gates.

She spent ten weeks in hospital recovering from her injuries.

Four
 girls and a boy aged between five and ten were injured - including a 
fractured skull, bleeding on the brain and broken bones.

One
 girl aged ten spent three days on a life support machine and has 
undergone a series of operations - and still doesn’t have use of her 
left arm.

One mother, who had been walking her daughter to school, was flung into bush suffering a fractured pelvis after she was hit by the car.

A woman who was 13 weeks’ pregnant at the time was also hurt, but went on to make a full recovery, the court was told.

One mother, who cannot be identified for legal reasons, later told police her child was dead after he was found unconscious on the ground.

'We were on our way to school and I turned around and heard the sound of a loud car engine,' she said.

'The next thing I knew.... (my children) had been hit by the car. One of them was face down on the floor and unconscious.

Eyewitnesses said they saw the defendant emerge from the crashed car bleeding from his head and looking completely dazed and confused

District Judge Bodfan Jenkins was told on June 20, last year, Bell¿s car had been driving as normal and keeping to the 20mph speed limit before suddenly accelerating

'When my child came around he was crying and in complete shock.'

Another parent described the aftermath of the crash to police as 'complete chaos'.

She said: 'Parents and children were screaming.'

Eyewitnesses said they saw the defendant emerge from the crashed car bleeding from his head and looking completely dazed and confused.

Prosecutor Ms Jones said Bell was overheard saying: 'Did I do anything wrong? Was it my fault?'

Police later found the defendant had been wearing flip-flops at the time, though the court was told the footwear had not caused the crash.

Diabetic Bell had been driving past the school with a passenger in the front seat. The passenger later told him he had been coughing heavily just before the accident.

Prosecutor Lisa Jones said: 'No-one but Mr Bell caused the car to veer across the road.

'A competent driver wouldn’t have driven the car that way. The real issue is whether he is responsible for the manner of the driving.

'He says he had no control because he was unconscious or unaware at the time.'

He later tested negative for alcohol and although his blood sugar was 'higher than normal' it would 'not have caused him to blackout', the court was told.

A court heard the 2.6 litre engine car, which had more than 160,000 miles on the clock, suddenly veered across the road and hit parents and pupils before colliding with a bollard and sliding on its roof

Police later found the Audi was in 'good working order' despite its high mileage.

However, Bell's barrister David James said a severe coughing fit had prompted his client to lose control of the car.

The defendant said he was taken to hospital in 1998 with a severe chest infection.

Bell told the court doctors believed he had suffered 'cough syncope' while on the ward - which can cause a person to faint.

However, he said he had been unaware of this fact until the Crown Prosecution Service requested his medical notes ahead of his trial.

The defendant also spoke of the moment he climbed out his car following the crash.

He said: 'I saw one of the children on the floor...and blood was coming out of their mouth.

'The blood ran from the pavement to the gutter.'

And after seeing lollipop lady Ms Williams at the front of the car and another woman who had been knocked down, he added: 'I thought three people had died.

'I walked to the centre of the road and stood there in shock for sometime.'

Bell said until three months ago he was on medication for high blood pressure called Ramipril. Among its side effects include coughing, the court was told.

The court also heard evidence from a front seat passenger who had been in the vehicle when the defendant lost control of the car.

The witness, who cannot be named for legal reasons, said Bell had been coughing severely while at the wheel.

'I told him to stop because there was a red light, but the car just kept going,' they said.

'I looked across at him and his eyes were shut.

'I shouted at him "stop".... I thought he might have heard me.

'The next thing the car was upside down.'

The trial continues.
