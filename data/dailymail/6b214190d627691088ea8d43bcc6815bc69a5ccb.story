Australian police have seized half a billion dollars' worth of the drug ice and heroin after destroying a Hong Kong-linked international drugs syndicate.

Police seized the record half tonne of drugs hidden in a shipment of 3,200 terracotta pots from Thailand in Botany Bay, Sydney yesterday.

It is the largest haul of ice in Australian history and the third biggest heroin bust and was the culmination of a year-long operation following a tip-off from US authorities.

Seven people, four from Hong Kong and three from Australia, were detained over the huge haul of 674 pounds of crystal methamphetamine and 555 pounds of heroin.

Home Affairs Minister Jason Clare said it was a major breakthrough.

He said: ‘This is more heroin and more amphetamine than we often seize in an entire year.’

Stopped drugs on the street: Deputy Police Commissioner Andrew Colvin said the bust stopped huge amounts of drugs reaching Australian streets

The Australian deputy police commissioner Andrew Colvin said: ‘This has prevented half a billion dollars of drugs reaching Australian streets.

‘This was an 11 month investigation where we've had tight control over a number of people who we suspected of being involved in illicit narcotic importations.'

Those arrested, aged between 29 and 61-years-old, appeared in court today charged with various drug importation and distribution offences and were remanded in custody until October 17.

The charges carry a maximum penalty of life in jail.

The investigations are continuing and further arrests were possible Mr Colvin said.

He said: ‘We're talking about a significant quantity of two separate types of substances which generally have different source countries.

‘At the end of the day, there's a lot of “Mr Mediums” and “Mr Littles” that work with “Mr Big”.

‘I think we've got a good combination of the people responsible for this importation.’

Investigations continue: Further arrests could be made as the Australian Federal Police continue their investigations
