Bobby Fransis Barnes, 19, was born female but has wanted to be male for as long as he can remember.

From the age of four Bobby dressed as a boy, he dated girls as he got older and at the age of 15 he decided to begin hormone treatment to become a fully-fledged man.

He is now living as man while he waits for full sex change surgery and while Bobby has always had the full support of his mother Tracey Wood in his quest to change his sex, in another twist Bobby has fallen in love with Tracey's best friend Donna Price.

Donna knew Bobby as a young girl but lost touch with the family until she met Bobby again last year.

The two of them got together after a chance meeting in a pub and now have Tracey's blessing to get married.

Today the trio from Worcester appeared on This Morning to explain how they are delighted to be part of such a modern romance.

Bobby and Donna met years after Donna had lost touch with his mother Tracey, and fell in love immediately

Mother Tracey, who has four other sons and one daughter, told hosts Holly Willoughby and Phillip Schofield: 'I always knew,. He was always a tomboy.

'He was misbehaving one day when he was little and I said "What do I have to do to make you behave?" he told me that he wanted to have a boy's haircut and a boy's school uniform like his brothers and so that's what I did.'

'It has never been a secret. I always said not to lie about anything, just be honest.'

Bobby, who like the rest of the family spent most of the interview grinning, said: 'From day one I always felt this. It just came naturally.

'It has been a bit of a struggle, but with my mum's support it went quite smoothly.

'I got a bit of gip at school, but the more I have explained to people the better it has been.'

Bobby says that he knew from the age of four that he should have been born a man

Donna, who was understandably nervous about getting back in touch with Tracey after meeting and falling for Bobby, joked: 'I went with Tracey to get his first short back and sides!'

Although the women lost touch Bobby insists that he never forgot the older woman that his younger self had always had a crush on.

In August 2012 Bobby was living as an 18-year-old man and as soon as he saw Donna in a local pub he knew he only had one chance to make something happen.

Donna said: 'I bumped in to him, said 'alright bab', I didn't think I would be walking out of the pub with him because I was there to kiss someone else!

'But then Bobby spun me around and just kissed me.

Donna admitted that she was nervous about seeing Tracey again and admitting that she was in love with Bobby but Tracey said she is delighted that they are together as Donna already knows everything

'I was scared because his mum Tracey was my old friend and I have known him from such a young age ... but I don't need to care about people's feelings now as long as I know I love him, because we are going to spend the rest of our lives together.

'And Tracey said she was glad he was with me.'

Tracey added: 'When he got with Donna, who already knew about everything, I felt a relief because it wasn't just me anymore.'

Host Philip Schofied summed up the complicated but uplifting situation saying with a smile, saying: 'You can't stop true love.'
