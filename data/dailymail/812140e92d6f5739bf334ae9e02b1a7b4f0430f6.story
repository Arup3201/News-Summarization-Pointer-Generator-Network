A small Idaho grocery chain has been dubbed 'Wal-Mart's worst nightmare' after recording huge profits at its 100 stores.

The no frills Western-based chain WinCo offers cheaper prices as well as better employee conditions than its giant rival, according to experts who claim that the small chain could one day be national competitor.

The danger for Wal-Mart is fitting given the company started with a name aping the large chain.

Strength to strength: Rapidly expanding grocery chain WinCo offer lower prices and better pay and conditions for staff than most of their big rivals

WinCo keeps prices low by buying direct from suppliers and asking customers to bag their own groceries

In 1999 Waremart became WinCo and with it started a winning formula which has won it plaudits and profits.

It keeps its costs low by eliminating the middleman and buying direct from suppliers often sending their own trucks to collect produce which means they get a better price.

Customers are also expected to bag their own groceries and credit cards are not accepted, bringing prices down even further.

And unlike WalMart, which tends to offer dozens of different brands' versions of the same item, WinCo normally stocks just one or two and little is spent on advertising or store decoration.

'While many supermarkets strive to keep within a few percentage points of Walmart Stores’ prices, WinCo Foods often undersells the massive discount chain,' Supermarket News says.

And retail analyst Burt Flickinger III described WinCo rise as being 'unstoppable'.

He told the Idaho Statesman: 'They’re Wal-Mart’s worst nightmare.'

WinCo currently has 137 stores in 26 states, employs 15,000 members of staff and had 
sales of $1.33 billion last year. They are planning to open more stores throughout 2014 and 2015

Stores are large but not unwieldy ranging from 18,000 to 23,000 
square feet, less than half the average supermarket.

Running scared? WinCo has been described by business analysts as 'Wal Mart's worst nightmare'

Unlike WalMart which is notorious for offering low pay, WinCo also offers provides staff with health benefits and pensions.

Retail expert Brad Tuttle told Time Magazine: 'Generally speaking, shoppers tolerate Walmart’s empty shelves and subpar customer service because the prices are so good.

'The fact that another retailer—even a small regional one—is able to compete and sometimes beat Walmart on prices, while also operating well-organized stores staffed by workers who enjoy their jobs, like their employer, and genuinely want the company to be successful.'
