Dragons' Den star Duncan Bannatyne's financial director has been arrested as part of a probe into an alleged multi-million pound fraud at the entrepreneur's business.

Christopher Paul Watson, 45, one of Mr Bannatyne's most trusted directors, was arrested on suspicion of fraud by abuse of position and later bailed. 

It came after employees of the Bannatyne Group, which runs hotels, spas and health centres across the country, alerted police investigating the fraud to a 'serious financial matter.'

In a ghost-written autobiography, Riding The Storm, the business mogul said Mr Watson was among his inner trusted circle and his 'senior team'.

He describes Mr Watson as 'fantastic', saying that he helped negotiate the company out of a 'tight spot' during a difficult financial period. 

When describing the breakdown of his marriage to his second wife Joanne, Bannatyne also lists Mr Watson as one of the people who supported him through 'the most tumultuous two years of my life'.

The book tells how Mr Watson helped the entrepreneur assess his options when it came to the divorce settlement. 

Companies House lists Mr Watson, a father-of-three, as both secretary and a director of Bannatyne Fitness Limited.

It says he was appointed to the positions in February 2008 and December 2012 respectively.

A spokesman for Bannatyne's company, which is based in Darlington, said the investigation does not affect the day-to-day operation of the business.

The company thanked police for their professionalism during the investigation so far. 

In a statement, the spokesman for Mr Bannatyne's company added: 'The police are investigating a serious financial matter reported to them by the Bannatyne Group.

'We are grateful for their thoroughness and professionalism. We have no comment to make except to say that it does not affect the current operation of our successful business.' 

The group did not comment on Mr Watson's current employment status. 

A spokesman for Durham Police said: 'We can confirm a 45-year-old man was arrested on suspicion of fraud by abuse of position.

'The investigation involves an alleged multi-million pound fraud on a Darlington-based business.

'The man has been bailed pending further inquiries.'
