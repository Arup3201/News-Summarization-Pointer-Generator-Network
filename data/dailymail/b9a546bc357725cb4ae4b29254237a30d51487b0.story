Israeli forces have boarded aid vessels trying to break its naval blockade of Gaza, the country's military said today.

Two protest boats approached the Gaza coast on Friday with the intent to violate Israel's naval blockade of the territory, but were met by Israeli navy vessels, according to Palestinian activists.

The boats were said to have been towed to the Israeli port of Ashdod, north-east of Gaza, following a 'peaceful' takeover.

The Irish and Canadian boats with 27 activists from America and eight other countries on board had set sail from Turkey on Wednesday.

Activist Amjad Shaww said the Israelis told the boats, whose passengers had intended to carry on to Gaza, that they were entering a closed military zone.

The Israeli military said only that it was 'monitoring' the two ships.

Israel's navy has intercepted similar protest ships in the past, towing them to an Israeli port and detaining participants.

Israel says its naval blockade of Gaza is vital to prevent weapons from reaching militant groups like Hamas, the Iran-backed group that rules the territory.

However, critics call the blockade collective punishment of Gaza's residents.

Israel's government has said the activists can send supplies into Gaza overland.

Last year, nine Turkish pro-Palestinian activists were killed when they resisted an Israeli operation to halt a similar flotilla. Each side blamed the other for the violence.

The incident sparked an international outcry and forced Israel to ease its land blockade on Gaza, which was imposed in 2006 and tightened, with Egyptian cooperation, after Hamas seized control of the territory the following year.

Militants in Gaza have fired thousands of rockets into Israel in the past decade, and now have much of southern Israel in range.

Speaking after prayers at a Gaza City mosque, Ismail Haniyeh, the Hamas prime minister, addressed the passengers aboard the boats, saying, 'Your message has been delivered whether you make it or not.'

'The siege is unjust and must end,' Haniyeh said.
