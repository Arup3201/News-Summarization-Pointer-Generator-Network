An independent autopsy of an unarmed Mexican man killed by police in Washington state has produced different results from what investigators have reported, with at least two of the seven shots that struck him entering from the back, an attorney for the man's family said Thursday.

The independent results were released one day after law enforcement officials said that their autopsy had shown Antonio Zambrano-Montes, 35, was hit five or six times, but none of them from behind.

The special unit investigating the February 10 shooting in Pasco said the three officers involved in the shooting fired a total of 17 bullets at the orchard farm worker.

However today Charles Herrmann, the new lawyer representing the victim's estranged wife and two daughters, said the secondary results showed a disparity with those produced by police.

Shot in the back: The three officers involved in the death of Antonio Zambrano-Montes (pictured) shot him seven times, with two of those bullets hitting him from behind, a new autopsy has revealed 

Officials: Kennewick Police Sgt. Ken Lattin talks to reporters on Wednesday, February 25, 2015. Lattin said the three officers involved in the death fired 17 shots, including several that struck Zambrano-Montes, but no shots hit him in the back

A regional law enforcement task force is investigating the killing of Zambrano-Montes, which has led to protests and calls for a federal probe.

Police said Zambrano-Montes was throwing rocks at the three officers, one of whom was Hispanic, and ignored commands to surrender. 

The Mexican immigrant's death has prompted calls for a federal investigation and two weeks of demonstrations in Pasco, an agricultural center with 68,000 residents.

Herrmann commissioned the second autopsy, which was conducted February 20 by a Seattle pathologist.

Franklin County Prosecutor Shawn Sant didn't immediately return a call seeking comment on its findings.

At a news conference Wednesday, Kennewick police Sgt. Ken Lattin said preliminary results of the official autopsy showed Zambrano-Montes was shot five or six times, but 'there were no shots in the back.'

He said three officers fired a total of 17 shots at the former orchard worker.  

Suit: The family sued the city for $25 million but has since been withdrawn as the family's attorney claims the case needs further investigation photographed is Zambrano-Montes' mother

Lattin, a spokesman for the regional law enforcement task force examining the shooting, said he couldn't be more specific about where on Zambrano-Montes' body he was shot, because full autopsy results are pending.

Zambrano-Montes was throwing rocks at passing vehicles and later at responding officers, authorities say. 

Video taken by a witness shows the man running from Pasco officers. 

As the officers draw closer, he stops and faces them.

Multiple pops are heard, and he falls to the ground.

Lattin said officers fired stun guns at least twice but failed to stop Zambrano-Montes before using their weapons. 

The officers felt threatened, police said.

Zambrano-Montes' death at a busy intersection has sparked two weeks of protests in the city where more than half the residents are Hispanic but few are members of the police force or the power structure. 

Authorities say a stun gun failed to subdue the man .

Moving Away: Authorities say a stung gun failed to subdue the man and the shooting, captured on video, appears to show the man moving away from police when he was shot

Surrender: Police said Zambrano-Montes was throwing rocks at the three officers, one of whom was Hispanic, and ignored commands to surrender 

About one hundred friends and family members attended a funeral for Zambrano-Montes Wednesday.  

Demonstrators have accused Pasco police of using overly aggressive tactics when dealing with those in the Hispanic community.

Protesters have equated the shooting to that of the unarmed black men killed by police in Ferguson, Missouri and New York City.

Civil rights attorney Benjamin Crump, who represented the families of Trayvon Martin, Michael Brown, and Tamir Rice, was representing Zambrano-Montes family but the family has since received new counsel. 

The family's case was taken up by Seattle attorney  Herrmann, theLatin Post reports. 

The family sued the city for $25 million but has since been withdrawn as the family's attorney claims the case needs further investigation into the police department's policies. 

Authorities say the Mexican immigrant was throwing rocks at officers and a stun gun failed to subdue him. 

The Franklin County coroner has ordered an inquest into the death, which is being reviewed by the task force. The investigation is being monitored by federal authorities.

Lattin said the local investigation will be thorough and fair.

'We're not here to cover up for anybody,' he told reporters.

The killing was the fourth by police in less than a year for fast-growing Pasco, a city of 68,000 where more than half the residents are Hispanic but few are members of the police force or the power structure.

Officers were exonerated after similar investigations in the first three cases. Critics of the latest case say the officers should have used less than lethal force to capture Zambrano-Montes.

Police said officers felt threatened. Zambrano-Montes was arrested last year for assault after throwing objects at Pasco officers and trying to grab an officer's pistol, court records show.
