She may be at an age where most slow down, but Britain's oldest mod has refused to give up her beloved Vespa scooter, despite her children begging her to stop.

Grandmother-of-two Maureen Lear, who is 70 next month, has owned around 30 scooters since she passed her test at the age of 18 in 1961 and was part of the mod gang riots in Clacton-on-Sea, Essex.

Maureen, from Colchester in Essex, drove a silver 125 Vespa in the 1960s andÂ  said that she still loves the adrenalin-rush of zipping through rush-hour traffic

She wears a khaki jacket, black Doc Martin boots and listens to The Who and watches cult-film Quadrophenia once a week, more than 50 years after the mod scene disappeared.

The retired creche supervisor and carer said: 'I learnt on a Lambretta but I have always preferred Vespas.

'In the early 60s I drove a Capri and then I got a silver 125 Vespa.

'For the first test I turned up without my paper work so I failed. Then on the second one I lost the examiner.

"They used to stand on a corner, but I could not find him. Then he 
caught me going down a one-way street so I failed. I eventually passed 
the third time.'

A teenage Maureen wanted to learn how to ride a scooter when she saw her 21-year-old boyfriend's red Lambretta, and despite her parents breaking up the relationship.

When she turned 18 she was still determined and became involved in the mod gangs of the time.

Maureen said she will ride her scooter until she is forced to stop (left) and in 2003 at a rally on a Vespa PX 125 (right)

She added: 'I was a mod, but I was friends with some of the rockers, it was friendly rivalry.

'I was there for the Clacton riots. They were not that bad. I was probably on the back of my then boyfriend's red Lambretta.

'After all these years it is just really natural to me riding a scooter.

'I can drive my scooter better than I can walk now because I have arthritis in my knee. It is like having a mobility scooter.

'It is great because I never had to queue in rush hour traffic. My husband could never get the hang on riding a scooter.

Maureen currently owns a bright red Vespa remake PX 125cc - a special edition made for the Olympics - and zips around the streets daily on it.

As she approaches 70 her three terrified children have begged her to quit her mod scooter and get behind the wheel of a much safer car.

But despite her mature years Maureen has refused and says she plans to stay on her scooter until the day she dies - or fails her driving health check.

She added: 'Scooters aren't dangerous. I am still alive after all that time.

'My children do worry about me. My youngest daughter has tried to get me to learn to drive a car, but I am too claustrophobic.

'She says I will be able to carry more stuff in a car, but I can carry enough on my scooter.'I will never get behind the wheel of a car.

'My son Patrick is the only one who used to come on the back of my scooter. He used to hold on for dear life when I took him on the school run in the early 1970s.'

Maureen continued to ride despite getting 20 stitches in her head after an accident 30 years ago

But Patrick, now 44 and a civil servant, wants his mother to be a bit safer on the roads.

He said: 'In her head mum thinks she is about 30 years old.

'She is a bit more careful than she used to be. She used to go out on her bike whatever the weather, but now she doesn't go out if it is icy.

'She is quite a determined lady. We let her get on with it, but we look out for her too.

'We do not think anything of it as she is our mum, but fifty years of scooters is quite amazing.

'Mum knows so much about scooters. I think often when she goes to get it fixed she knows more than the people who are meant to be fixing it for her.'

Maureen had a serious crash 30 years ago when her orange French scooter 
crashed into the back of a car on her way home from work.

Her helmet saved her life and she escaped with 20 stitches in her head, but the accident did not put her off riding

He added: "I must have been about five or six when I was on the back of mum's scooter. All I remember was that the helmet was really big.

"Mum has always loved the fact that she can zip through the traffic. Scooters is all she has ever known so I don't know if she would be good in car.

"My sister in particular is desperate for her to stop riding the scooter. At least she has her independence."

Maureen's husband David, an accountant, died in 2004 at the age of 63 from cancer.
