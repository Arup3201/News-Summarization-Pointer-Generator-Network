It's rare for a referee to become an internet sensation for anything other than a game-changing gaffe or falling over but that can't be said of Fernanda Colombo Uliana.

The 25-year-old assistant ref has been officiating in Brazil for some time but turned heads while making a step up to the Copa do Brasil as Sao Paulo beat CRB 3-0.

And this Sunday she'll run the line in her Brazilian top-flight match when Atletico Mineiro (who boast former Barcelona superstar Ronaldinho) take on Cruzeiro.

Uliana is
 among a host of women to have have recently made their way into 
male-dominated areas of football and is putting in the hard yards to be 
recognised for more than her appearance. 

Just this 
week, Portugese manager Helena Costa became the first female boss of a 
club in one of Europe's top two leagues when appointed at the helm of 
Clermont Foot in France.

Italian
 official and part-time model Elena Tambini, also 25, is also on the 
rise in her home nation and she is predicted to officiate in Serie B, Serie A and internationally in the future.

Despite supporting the progression of women into top refereeing roles, Brazilian 
football hasn't exactly been a bastion of gender equality of late.

In charge: Helena Costa has been appointed manager of Ligue 2 side Clermont Foot

Best of British: Sian Massey ran the line for Manchester United and Sunderland on May 3

Happy with her progress: Uliana smiles for a selfie

Lower
 league side Juventus de Santa Catarina's coach Celso Teixeira found 
himself in trouble recently for calling assistant referee Maira 
Americano Labes 
‘gostoso’ - which means 'tasty' in Portugese - after being sent off 
during a Catarinense championship game.

Labes
 said she took no offence as she was concentrating on the game. Teixeira
 says the comment was made by someone from the crowd.

On
 Instagram, Labes said: ‘Beauty should pass unnoticed. I’d like for the 
day to come for women to be recognised for their work just like men.’

In
 Britain last November, mother-of-two Amy Fearn became the first woman 
to take charge of a first-round FA Cup tie when Corby Town hosted Dover 
Athletic. She was also the first woman to referee in the Football League.

Sian Massey has been officiating Premier League matches since 2011 and found herself at the centre of a sexism storm when she was the target of some derogatory comments from then-Sky Sports pundit Andy Gray.
