An Illinois auction house says it is selling the revolver that almost killed former Alabama Governor George Wallace.

Rock Island Auction Company specializes in rare firearms. It listed the revolver for sale on Friday.

Company vice president Judy Voss says it's the same gun used to shoot Wallace during a 1972 assassination attempt. 

Voss says the serial number on the gun matches that listed on police reports. Voss says a date etched in to the gun also matches law enforcement records.

Arthur Bremer shot Wallace during a Maryland stop as the governor campaigned for president. It left Wallace paralyzed from the waist down.

The auction company gave a presale estimated value of between $15,000 and $30,000. Voss did not say who was selling the gun.

Nine years before his assassination, one of the most iconic moments in the history of America's civil rights movement took place with the infamous 'stand in the schoolhouse door'.

It was on June 11, 1963, when then governor George Wallace tried to stop two black students from registering for classes at the University of Alabama.

He stood in the door at the university's Foster Auditorium and, in defiance of federal law, refused Vivian Malone and James Hood entry.

When federal marshals intervened, he stood firm and delivered an impassioned speech against desegregation. 

Wallace eventually relented when a U.S. general acting under orders issued by President John F Kennedy demanded he make way. Malone and Hood then entered.

The incident brought Wallace into the national spotlight and led to the desegregation of the university as Malone and Hood made history by becoming the first black students to enroll.

George Wallace's symbolic attempt to stop black students enrolling followed his inaugural promise of 'segregation now, segregation tomorrow, segregation forever' and stop the desegregation of schools.

Eleven years earlier, the U.S. Supreme Court handed down its landmark decision in Brown Vs Board of Education of Topeka, Kansas, in which it was argued the education of black children separate from white children was unconstitutional.

The Brown case meant the University of Alabama had to be desegregated. But in the years that followed hundreds of African-Americans applied for admission, but all were denied. 

The university worked with police to find any disqualify them, or when this failed, intimidated the applicants.

But in 1963, three African-Americans with perfect qualifications - Vivian Malone Jones, Dave McGlathery and James Hood - applied, and refused to be intimidated. 

In early June a federal district judge ordered that they be admitted, and forbade Governor Wallace from interfering.

Then on June 11, Malone and Hood arrived to register, with Wallace attempting to uphold his promise. Federal marshals told Wallace to step aside but Wallace cut Katzenbach off and refused, giving a speech on States' rights.

It took General Henry Graham to command Wallace to step aside, saying: 'Sir, it is my sad duty to ask you to step aside under the orders of the President of the United States.'

Wallace, who survived an assassination attempt that left him in a wheelchair, died in 1998 having renounced segregationism.
