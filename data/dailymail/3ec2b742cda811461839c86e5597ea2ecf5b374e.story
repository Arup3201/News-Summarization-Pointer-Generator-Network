Woodstock is not only one of the most famous music festivals of all time, it was also one of the defining moments of the 1960s counter-culture movement.

What started as a free event advertised for 50,000, quickly turned into one of the most important music festival in history, attended by over half a million people, united in a message of peace, love, openness and cultural expression.

Rolling Stone magazine’s first photographer Baron Wolman was sent to Max Yasgur's farm in the Catskills, upstate New York, to cover the festival and now 45 years later he has released a book featuring previously unreleased photographs of the era-defining event.

‘No one could have predicted the enduring influence of the Woodstock experience,’ said Wolman, now 76.

‘Yes, the bands were first rate and there were many of them. And the setting … was picture perfect and tranquil, a bucolic setting for relaxing with friends and listening to music and getting high. But in unexpected ways, Woodstock became more than a concert for all of us.’

Although assigned with a brief to photograph what was happening on stage, Wolman found himself more inspired by the crowds of hippies than the performers.

‘I ended up spending most of my time out in the wild with the crowd because what was happening “out there” was just too interesting not to explore.’

'I ended up spending most of my time out in the wild with the crowd because what was happening "out there" was just too interesting not to explore,' said Wolman

During the sometimes rainy weekend, 32 acts performed outdoors before an audience of over 500,000 young people at Max Yasgur's 600-acre dairy farm in the Catskills

The influx of attendees to the rural concert site in Bethel created a massive traffic jam

More interested in the crowd than the performers, his photographs are hugely evocative and offer an insight into this legendary event that is rarely seen.

‘The thing to remember about the 1960s, even near the end in ‘69 was that everything was totally different, the behavior was new and unexpected.

'Plus, the 1960s were simply wildly photogenic in every way imaginable ... the changes that were taking place in the heads of the people were visually manifested. I mean, how could you not take pictures?’

Released to commemorate the 45th anniversary, Woodstock features Wolman's stunning black and white photographs, the majority of which are published for the first time.

The images perfectly capture the zeitgeist, the music, the drugs, the people, the sheer hedonism; the enduring legacy of the most famous festival ever.

The event was captured in the 1970 documentary movie Woodstock, an accompanying soundtrack album, and Joni Mitchell's song Woodstock, which commemorated the event and became a major hit for Crosby, Stills, Nash & Young

The book also features a foreword by musician Carlos Santana and a Q&A with Wolman and Woodstock creator, Michael Lang, who share their personal experiences of Woodstock.

Also included is Wolman’s contact sheets in their entirety, including outtakes.

‘It is a rare and fascinating treat when photographers allow us to see their contact sheets,’ said contributor Dave Brolan.

‘What is remarkable about this selection of contact sheets is that almost every frame is as good as the next, and we get to see Woodstock exactly as Baron saw it, every single unbelievable moment.’

Wolman began the music phase of his photographic career in 1967, as the very first photographer for the new Rolling Stone magazine.

He went on to capture the 60s pop rock explosion, including: Janis Joplin, the Rolling Stones, the Who, Jimi Hendrix, Pink Floyd, Bob Dylan amongst many more.

‘I see myself as a kind of voyeur … I’m happiest when I’m invisible and watching. … I’m a chameleon and can adapt myself to the situation, and that, to me, is one of the gifts that I was given naturally, and that’s how you get honest pictures.’

Woodstock by Baron Wolman is published by Reel Art Press and includes Wolman’s contact sheets in their entirety, including outtakes
