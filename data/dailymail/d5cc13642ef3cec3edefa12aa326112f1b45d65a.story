Once again Algeria proved a major pain in Fabio Capello's neck.

Four
 years ago England, managed by the Italian, produced one of their most 
abject World Cup performances in recent memory against the African 
nation in South Africa.

And on Thursday night, Algeria frustrated Capello yet again by ending Russia's 
World Cup participation in Curitiba in a pulsating 1-1 draw.

Victory for Russia would have set up a second round clash against Germany and an opportunity for Capello to right the wrongs of England's humiliating defeat against Joachim Low's side four years ago - and, of course, THAT Frank Lampard phantom goal.

Progressing into the knockout stages was easier said than done, though. 

Algeria needed just a point to progress through to the second round for the first time in their history.

For Russia on the other hand, it was win or bust. Only victory would see Capello's men leapfrog last night's opponents into second place.

The Italian manager was under immense pressure to drop Russian football's poster boy Alexander Kokorin for Aleksandr Kerzhakov up front ahead of last night's clash.  Capello bowed to public pressure as Kerzhakov took his place the starting line-up, but Kokorin also kept his shirt.

And the underfire striker repaid his manager's faith in the sixth minute by giving Russia an early lead.

The Dynamo 
Moscow forward planted an unstoppable header, after escaping Essaid 
Belkalem's attentions, from Oleg Shatov's outswinging cross past Adi 
Mbolhi.

The 23-year-old held his finger to his mouth as he celebrated, perhaps a response to critics back in his homeland.

On
 the touchline, Capello was more concerned about building on his side's 
dream start as the Russians threatened to increase their lead inside the
 opening 25 minutes.

Denis
 Glushakov's couldn't quite pull the trigger following a dangerous run 
through the heart of Algeria's back four, while Shatov watched a wicked 
long range effort fly narrowly wide of Mbolhi's goal.

Slowly
 but surely, though, the Algerian's dusted off their early cobwebs, with
 the impressive Yacine Brahimi leading his nation's charge.

And
 Vahid Halilhodzic's side went within inches from equalising in the 29th
 minute when Islam Slimani saw his header from Brahimi's corner 
brilliantly tipped over the bar by Igor Akinfeev.

Three
 minutes from half-time the pair combined again for almost a carbon copy
 of the earlier chance, but Slimani again saw his header saved.

And
 the Algerians were nearly punished for their missed chances just two 
minutes into the second half when Mbolhi produced an excellent point 
blank save from Alexander Samedov after an incisive one-two with 
Kokorin.

The importance of Mbolhi's was amplified on the hour when the Algerian's notched their decisive leveller.

The
 Brahimi/Slimani combination had already caused Russia problems in the 
first half - but Capello's side didn't learn their lesson.

This time Slimani's header from Brahimi's free-kick beat Akinfeev to put the Algerian's back on course for the knockout stages.

Algeria's fanatical supporters went mad, as did the players as the importance of Slimani's goal took hold of the African side.

Abdelmoumene Djabou saw his long-range effort comfortably saved moments later as Algeria went for the jugular.

Kerzakhov threatened to spoil the Algerian party in the 70th minute, but saw his low shot saved by the excellent Mbolhi.

And
 Algerian boss Halilhodzic made the surprising decision to take off 
Brahimi, his side's most potent attacking threat, with 20 minutes left 
to play.

It was a clear statement of intent from Halilhodzic as he looked to protect his side's vital point.

Likewise, Capello knew it was now or never as he urged his side on in search of a decisive second.

But
 for all their late pressure, the Russian's struggled to carve out an 
opportunity that could save their World Cup as Algerian kept the wolves 
from their door.

Capello
 cut a frustrated figure in his technical area, while Halilhodzic tried 
his best to keep cool as the Russians threw the kitchen sink at his 
side.

The
 Algerian manager wasn't as cool, however, as the referee blew the final
 whistle to book his side's place in the knockout stages.
