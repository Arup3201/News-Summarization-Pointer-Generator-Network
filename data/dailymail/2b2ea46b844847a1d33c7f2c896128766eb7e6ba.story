New research has found the prevalence of carrier bags is having a 'significant' impact on towns and cities

The number of plastic bags blighting the streets of Britain after being thrown away by shoppers is at its highest level in a decade, a report has revealed.

A surge in the use of carrier bags, some of which can take hundreds of years to degrade, has seen supermarkets handing out more than one billion more than they did four years ago.

And research has shown that the prevalence of carriers is now having a significant impact on the streets of our towns and cities, with more discarded bags than ever before.

The number of areas with an unacceptable number of plastic bags lying on the ground has more than doubled in the last ten years.

The finding was revealed in a yearly study into the amount of litter on Britain’ s streets by the Keep Britain Tidy campaign group.

It will further reinforce the Government’s decision to levy a 5p charge on plastic carrier bags in England from next year.

The Daily Mail has been running a ‘Banish the Bags’ campaign for six years with huge support from anti-litter campaigners, environmental groups and shoppers.

As well as harming animals and birds, production and transportation of the bags is costly and harmful to the environment.

Despite an overall decline in the amount of litter, the report shows the number of sites polluted with plastic bags is at its highest ever level.

The analysis of 7,200 sites across England found that 11.4 per cent were littered by plastic bags between 2013 and 2014.

In the previous year, 8.9 per cent of sites were shown to be blighted by carriers, while a significant increase has occurred from the 4.4 per cent recorded ten years ago.

As well as being an eyesore, plastic bags have a significant environmental effect on our coastline, with around 70 bags littering every mile, and seas. They can be ingested by marine wildlife.

The seven biggest supermarket chains handed out 8.3 billion bags - used by shoppers for an average of 20 minutes - in 2013.

This was up from the 7.2 billion given to customers in 2009/10 and excludes the millions more bags handed out by smaller retailers.

Carriers have been described by campaigners as ‘plastic poison’.

Environment minister Dan Rogerson confirmed last night that the latest litter survey revealed a rise in dumped carrier bags.

He said: ‘To counter this are preparations are well advanced for the introduction of a 5p charge on single-use plastic bags.’

‘Litter has a huge impact on the quality of our streets and public spaces and we all have a responsibility to keep our communities tidy.’

‘While we have made great progress in recent years, this research shows there is still more to be done.

‘I hope local authorities consider these results as they work to keep our neighbourhoods clean and tidy.’

The annual survey also found an increase in the number of fast-food and soft drinks-related litter on Britain’s streets.

Cigarettes and other smoking material was once again the most littered item, followed by confectionary wrappers.

A 5p charge per carrier bag will be introduced in England next October. Small shops employing fewer than 250 people are exempt.

The plans are expected to raise £100 million for environmental causes a year.

Charges introduced in Wales, which apply regardless of the retailer’s size, and Northern Ireland, have significantly reduced the number of carrier bags used per head of population.

Retailers in Scotland began charging last month, while the Republic of Ireland has seen a staggering 90 per cent reduction in bag use after its introduction of a levy in 2002.

Ministers hope the charge in England will reduce usage by between 75 and 80 per cent.

After a promising reception, the announcement of a plastic bag charge by Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg earlier this year has since been met with cross-party criticism.

MPs have said that caveats attached to the charge will ‘dilute the benefits’.

Earlier this year, the Government rejected calls by the Environmental Audit Committee to make bags sold by all retailers, not just major supermarkets and large retailers, subject to the charge.

The committee said that the decision would lessen the effect of the charge in England compared to Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland, where all bags are covered by the 5p charge.

Bodies representing small retailers, including the Association of Convenience Stores, the National Federation of Retail Newsagents and the British Retail Consortium, have all supported the charge.

But Conservatives insist the exemption is needed to protect small business.

Paper bags will also be excluded from the charge, unlike the rest of the UK, with campaigners claiming that such bags are one of the most littered items and often originate from fast-food establishments.

Wales, which introduced the 5p per bag fee in 2011, has recorded a 79 per cent drop in plastic bag usage in the last four years.

Northern Ireland also had a big fall of 71 per cent since introducing a 5p charge in 2013.

Last year, Italy became the first European country to ban non-biodegradable single-use plastic bags.
