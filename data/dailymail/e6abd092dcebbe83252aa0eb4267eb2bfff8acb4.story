A joke at the expense of the mentally ill, however it was intended, is probably not the most politically correct thing for a police officer to post on Twitter.

The non-PC PC’s tweet included a photograph of an officer, said to be PC Nick Boyce, with ice cream splattered on his uniform.

With the picture was the comment: ‘Warning do not get  to [sic] close to people with  mental health problems when they are eating ice cream.’

Offensive: The tweet which appeared to poke fun at mentally ill was sent out from an account run by he police liaison officers with Bristol University on Bank Holiday Monday

One said: ‘Wow, this is ill-judged at the very least! I can’t get over it. I’m quite angry in fact.’

Another commented: ‘That’s absolutely abhorrent. I’d do more than smash an ice cream into the tw*t’s chest.’

Another reacted: ‘I’m actually appalled. the more I read it, the more I can’t believe how ignorant they can be!’

And Phil Verney said: ‘Yeah, and of course Churchill, Stephen Fry are known for throwing ice cream at people.’

Yesterday Avon and Somerset Police would not confirm what had actually happened ahead of the officer been covered in ice cream and whether or not he had actually engaged with someone suffering from mental health issues.

Appalling: Avon and Somerset police's chief constable apologised for the offensive tweet of PC Nick Boyce (pictured)

But Chief Constable Nick Gargan responded to the original tweet posted on @BristolUniCops, saying: ‘It was very unwise indeed and will be deleted and apologised for as soon as the account holder responds to my [direct message].’

He added of the incident: ‘Removal, contrition & education are precisely right. ‘Just had a call from the Control room: we’re on it.”

The @BristolUniCops account is run by Pc Nick Boyce & PCSO Dudley Rowe who are the police liaison officers with Bristol University.

A tweet on the page later said: “Sorry everyone for that regrettable tweet earlier. ‘I take @MentalHealthCop advice. We’ve now had removal. Contrition & education next.’

Pc Boyce is a serving officer with over 25 years’ experience and a former merchant navy sailor.

Yesterday other Twitter users urged Mr Gargan to punish the officer responsible.

One said: ‘Wow @ngargan_police you really need to have a word with @BristolUniCops about their attitudes towards mental health. Very ill judged tweet.’

Saying sorry: The Twitter profile of Bristol University police liason officers PC Nick Boyce and PCSO Dudley Rowe later had several apologetic tweets posted

The tweet was yesterday removed from Twitter.

The message on the @BristolUniCops page said: ‘Apologies this was not mean to offend sorry if it did it wasn’t meant too [sic].’

Yesterday a second added: ‘Dear all, I now realise that my tweet of yesterday was totally inappropriate. I apologies again if it caused any offence.’

Last month another officer from Avon and Somerset Police was sacked for a Twitter account criticising his force and comparing bosses to ‘slime’.

Tony Ryan, 33, sent more than 800 tweets from @TheBritishCop - including labelling his officials ‘’scum’’.

He always denied the Twitter site was his - but his seniors matched his tweets with his duties and ruled it must have been his.

He was dismissed for gross misconduct after a disciplinary panel decided on the ‘balance of probability’ he was the anonymous officer.

Investigators could not directly attribute the posts to him but decided they matched his ‘intimate knowledge’.
