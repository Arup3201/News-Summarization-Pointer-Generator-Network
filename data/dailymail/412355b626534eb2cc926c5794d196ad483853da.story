As anyone embarking on a New Year's diet will understand, sometimes the allure of chocolate can be almost impossible to resist.

That is what the owner of Lisa's chocolate shop in Stockholm must have been thinking as he lovingly arranged the window display on Monday.

But the treats proved so tempting they attracted a rather unwanted visitor in the form of a rat, who was caught having his very own midnight feast after closing hours.

Midnight feast: The rat was caught helping itself to chocolates after the shop had closed for the night

Fine taste: The cheeky critter was helping itself to luxury Danish Royal Warrant truffles

Trouble: Staff say they have never had problems before, despite the area being known as a home for rodents

The rodent was found chewing its way through several expensive Danish Royal Warrant truffles by shocked members of staff.

Chocolate shop worker Pernilla Lene, said: 'I could see one at a time. We don't know if it was one and the same or more.

She added: 'It wasn't afraid. But you didn't know what was rat droppings or sprinkles.'

Is that what I think it is?: Assistant said it was difficult to differentiate between sprinkles and rat droppings

Reassuring: The owner of the shop insisted the chocolates were for display only and wouldn't be sold

Ratatouille: The scenes are reminiscent of the animated film in which a rat wants to become a chef and so invades the kitchens of Paris in order to cook

Luckily for customers owner Grigori Lifchits said the chocolate in the winder were not for sale, and that everything else was put away at night.

He added : 'I've worked here for six years. It is the first time I hear about rats. I will speak to the landlord tomorrow, it's his responsibility.'

Lisa's is located in Old Town in Stockholm, an area which is known for its problems with rats and other pests, so it is perhaps surprising that even the display chocolates were left out overnight.

Raided: It was Lisa's chocolate shop in Stockholm that was targetted by the hungry late-night thief

Blending in: It may have been hard for staff to spot the rat as it camouflaged itself with the brown chocolates

The scenes are reminiscent of Ratatouille, the animated film in which a rat called Remy with aspirations of becoming a chef infiltrates some of Paris's best kitchens in order to cook.

After impressing the city's toughest restaurant critic Remy is eventually revealed as a rat and is chased out of town.

However it looks as if the rat in Stockholm has managed to cook up nothing other than trouble, and is likely to have had a similar fate awaiting him.
