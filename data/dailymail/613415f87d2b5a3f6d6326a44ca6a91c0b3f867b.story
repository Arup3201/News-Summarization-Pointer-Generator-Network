An incredible video has shown the nail-biting moment a seaplane came within inches of landing on a humpback whale.

The footage taken by witness Thomas Mann last week shows the near-collision in the remote Alaskan village of Angoon, which is only accessible by boat or plane.

On the video, a de Havilland Beaver seaplane from Juneau can be seen trying to land and getting within inches of the surface before suddenly accelerating away from the water.

Landing: A de Havilland Beaver seaplane gets within inches of landing on water - unaware a whale is below

Approach: The seaplane almost lands as the humpback whale forces air through its blowhole, circled right

'All the sudden, the pilot advanced the throttle and I didn't know why. I thought, "Oh something must be wrong",' Hamm told CNN.

But if you watch the video closely you can see water being forced upwards through the whale's blowhole as the plane attempts to land.

After he decides to accelerate again, the pilot soars through a cloud of droplets from the blowhole before eventually landing safely.

'Damn near landed right on that f***ing whale!' one shocked witness can be heard yelling on the video, with another adding: 'He had to go right over it!'

Near miss: Reacting to the commotion from people along the shore, the pilot decides against landing on the water - just as he flies through the droplets forced up by the whale

Relief: Witnesses along the shore exhale with relief as the seaplane makes a safe landing moments later

Scene: The seaplane landed on the Alaska island of Angoon - which is only accessible by plane or boat

Hamm said he showed the video to the pilot, who had no idea he was flying above the humpback whale.

Instead, he had decided to put off his landing after seeing people on the shore pointing and yelling.

After the pilot pulled away, the whale breached, Hamm said - and they all agreed the pilot had had a lucky escape.

But when the pilot saw the footage, he said he hadn't even seen the whale and was instead reacting to the people yelling at him from the shore
