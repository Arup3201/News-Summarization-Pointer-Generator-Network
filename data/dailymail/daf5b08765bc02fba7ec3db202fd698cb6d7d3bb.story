Elouise Keeling, 14, collapsed with breathing problems during an Air Cadets sports day at RAF Brampton near Huntingdon, Cambridgeshire, on June 25

A schoolgirl cried ‘I’m going to die’ after an ambulance went to the wrong address as she had a fatal asthma attack.

Paramedics were called after Elouise Keeling, 14, collapsed with breathing difficulties during an air cadets sports day at an RAF base, but she died after they went to an airfield ten miles away.

Her mother Karen Keeling, 33, told an inquest yesterday of the ‘chaos’ as she waited helplessly, and that when ambulance staff did turn up, they just ‘strolled over’.

Mrs Keeling had rushed to RAF Brampton, near Huntingdon, Cambridgeshire, on June 25 last year after her daughter phoned to say she was unwell.

An ambulance was called at 7.44pm but was sent to RAF Wyton and did not arrive until 8.03pm – more than twice the response for high-priority cases.

Elouise was pronounced dead an hour later. Mrs Keeling said: ‘She rang me and said, “Mum, my asthma is really bad, you need to come now”. She sounded really panicked.

‘When I got to her, her eyes were open but she was unconscious. When they arrived it was quite chaotic.

‘They seemed slow getting out of the vehicle. They just strolled over. Equipment kept failing – oxygen cylinders kept running out.’

Michael Smith, 19, the cadet who made the 999 call, told how he repeatedly asked the call handler to send the ambulance to RAF Brampton, not Wyton.

He said he tried to help Elouise, adding: ‘I was trying to calm her and she was very panicked. She was shouting, “I’m going to die”.’

The inquest at Huntingdon Law Courts heard how Elouise, who had suffered from asthma since she was 18 months old, had not taken part in the sports day but had jogged a short distance.

Wing Commander Anthony Kelly, in charge of the Air Cadets, said ambulances had been unable to find the base twice before.

The inquest heard that one vehicle got 
lost because 'there were too many blue doors' on her street while 
another stopped for petrol while answering the 999 call in March.

An ambulance was immediately called at 7.44pm but was sent to RAF Wyton, 10 miles away, by mistake. The error meant it did not arrive until 8.03pm

In October last year, another inquest heard that Evelyn Heath, 93, from Attleborough, Norfolk, died from an irregular heartbeat in the back of an ambulance after the vehicle took more than four hours to reach her care home.

Wing Commander Anthony Kelly, who is 
in charge of Air Cadets in Huntingdon, told the inquest at Huntingdon 
Law Courts that there had been incidents in 2006 and 2012 when 
ambulances had been unable to find the base because of an issue over the
 postcode.

'My understanding is that the matters were reported to the ambulance service,' he added.

Since Elouise's deaths, both sites have been allocated individual postcodes.

The inquest continues.

Delays: Emergency services were called when Elouise had an asthma attack but paramedics did not reach her in time and she died

Lost: Three-month-old Bella Hellings died when paramedics took 26 minutes to reach her after she had a fit and got lost again on the way to hospital

In December, 79-year-old Barry Edwards died after an 
ambulance took two-and-a-half hours to arrive. Mr Edwards only lived 
just over a mile from Addenbrooke Hospital, Cambridge, where he was 
eventually treated, but it was only after  three calls to 999 that an 
ambulance was sent from 83 miles away in Great Yarmouth to take him to 
hospital. He died the next morning.

In January an 
unannounced inspection by the Care Quality Commission warned the East of
 England Ambulance Service Trust to improve its care of patients after 
receiving several complaints from people who had waited up to three 
hours for an ambulance to take them to hospital.

Later 
that month, police officers complained that they were having to take 
patients to hospital 'on a daily basis' because no EEAST ambulances were
 available, and were regularly having to wait 'an inordinate amount of 
time' for their paramedic colleagues to arrive at the scene of an 
emergency.

A week later, firefighters warned that 
something was 'going seriously wrong with the 999 response' of the 
EEAST. They said they were waiting 'longer and longer' for ambulances to
 arrive and found paramedics often arrived alone on motorbikes or cars 
and were unable to transport patients to hospital. Keith Handscomb, of 
East Anglia FBU, said: 'Fire officers tell us of their desperate 
frustration at being told to 
wait in line when chasing up emergency requests for the attendance of an
 ambulance. Sometimes they are told the ambulance sent to their 
emergency has been 
redirected to another call due to there being no other ambulance 
available.'

In March, three-month-old Bella Hellings died
 after she suffered a fit and the ambulance that was supposed to be 
taking her to hospital got lost twice. The driver had been relying on a 
satnav and took 26 minutes to reach her at home in Bury St Edmunds, more
 than three times the target time of eight minutes. They got lost again 
on the way to hospital, where Bella was pronounced dead.
