Former Ajax midfielder Demy de Zeeuw has been advertising his services via his personal LinkedIn account after becoming a free agent in the summer.

The 31-year-old has been without a club since leaving Belgian side Anderlecht after the club decided not to renew the Dutchman's contract.

De Zeeuw, who has made 27 appearances for Holland, has taken to business-orientated social network site LinkedIn to search for a club in 'Europe, the Middle East or MLS'.

The 31-year-old made 59 appearances for Ajax between 2009 and 2011

As part of his personal statement, the tough tackling midfielder wrote: 'I play 27 international games for the Netherlands also on Euro and World Cup semi-final in 2010 South Africa, 18 Champions League games 3 goals [sic]'. 

De Zeeuw has also posted a four-year-old YouTube compilation (below) showing the very best of his performances throughout the years.

The former Anderlecht man hit the headlines during the 2010 World Cup in South Africa after being on the wrong end of a nasty kick from Uruguay star Martin Caceres.

De Zeeuw had to be hauled off at half-time after being accidentally kicked in the teeth by Caceres. The Dutch managed to win the tie without the midfielder, beating Uruguay 3-2 to advance to the World Cup final where they would be beaten 1-0 by Spain.  

De Zeeuw is looking for a club in Europe, the Middle East or the MLS, according to his LinkedIn page
