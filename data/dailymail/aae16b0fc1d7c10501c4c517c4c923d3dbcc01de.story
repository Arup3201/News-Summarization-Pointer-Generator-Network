Twin boys who were joined at the abdomen when they were born have finally left a Texas hospital today eight months after a complicated operation to separate them.

The playful brothers have made amazing progress since surgeons separated them when they were only one-month-old, but they won't be able to go home just yet.

For now, Owen and Emmett Ezell will continue their treatment at a rehabilitation center until their little bodies have fully recovered from the complicated surgery used to separate them.

While their parents long for them to be able to come home, this latest baby step towards their recovery is an important milestone for the twins.

When they were born in July last year, doctors were unsure if the boys, who shared intestines and a liver, would survive.

At just one-month-old, the twins underwent a nine-hour operation to separate them.

But, as they finally left the Medical City Children's Hospital for the first time since their birth, the doctors who cared for them were delighted at their progress.

'You can never predict what can happen but these little guys are definitely survivors,' Dr Tom Renard, the lead separation surgeon, told ABC News.

His thoughts were echoed by the twins' parents Jenni and David Ezell, who said they felt 'relief, joy and elation' that their boys were leaving hospital.

In their blog about the twins, the Ezells wrote yesterday of their excitement at the babies being allowed to leave.

'I can hardly believe it, but it is true - the babies are being discharged,' the post read yesterday. 'We are very excited, and maybe even a little nervous, but wowie! Definitely thrilled beyond description.'

The family added that the twins' older brothers Ethan and Liam were also looking forward to the day their siblings will come home.

The next stage in Owen and Emmett's healing process will focus as much on teaching mom and dad how to care for the twins, as it will on making sure the boys continue to be happy and healthy.

Homeward bound: It will be a few more weeks before the brothers finally go home, but their parents are delighted they are leaving hospital

'Iâ€™ll finally have my family together 
but we are about to face some serious challenges,' Mr Ezell said.

'The really 
frightening life-or-death stuff is behind us but now we worry how about 
how we are going to pull the rest of it off.'

While Own and Emmett are in the rehabilitation center, their parents will be taught how to manage  feeding tubes and a home ventilator, as well as learning how to carry out rehabilitation exercises.

Mrs Ezell said although it would be a daunting few months, she was looking forward to being able to finally care for her babies herself.

She said that despite the physical obstacles her sons have had to overcome, they acted like regular babies.

They are 'very interactive, very social little boys,' she told AZ Central, adding: 'They flirt with all of the girls that come in, flash smiles and wave.'

Dr Clair Schwendeman agreed, adding: 'They're showing signs that they've developed nicely, despite their long hospitalization.

'They're doing things that are rather appropriate: Owen was pulling on Emmett's ear, and they're playing back and forth.'

The family are raising money to help pay for the boysâ€™ medical care through the sale of T-shirts on the blog and through donations.
