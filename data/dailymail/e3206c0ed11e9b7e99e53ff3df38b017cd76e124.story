He can detect the opening of  a biscuit tin from 100 paces and performs tricks at the click of your fingers. 

But it seems the true display of your dog’s intelligence comes when he interacts with his canine friends.

Researchers have found that, when walking in a pack, dogs adopt a social hierarchy that gives away leadership roles, social rank and personality trait.

Dogs that lead when out for a walk with other canines are more responsive to training, research shows

Using high-resolution GPS harnesses, researchers from Oxford University, Evtvvs University, Budapest and the Hungarian Academy of Sciences tracked the movements of six dogs and their owner across fourteen 30 to 40 minute walks off the lead.

Results showed pooches that take the lead are more responsive to training, more controllable, older and more aggressive than dogs that follow.

Dogs that led more often had higher dominance ranks in everyday situations, the study for PLOS Computational Biology revealed.

The researchers say the technology used in the study could be applied to other dogs used for search and rescue to allow handlers to compare how different dogs work together and pick those with the highest compatibility.

Lead author Dr Mati Nagy, of Oxford University’s Department of Zoology, said: 'We showed that it is possible to determine the social ranking and personality traits of each dog from their GPS movement data.

'On individual walks it is hard to identify one permanent leader, but over longer timescales it soon becomes clear that some dogs are followed by peers more often than others.

'Overall, the collective motion of the pack is strongly influenced by an underlying social network.'

Dr Enik Kubinyi, of the Hungarian Academy of Sciences, said: 'The dominance questionnaire tells us the pecking order of dog groups by quantifying interactions between pairs.

'For example, the dogs that bark first and more when strangers enter the house, eat first at meals and wins fights are judged as more dominant.

'Conversely, dogs that lick other dogs’ mouths more often are less dominant as this is a submissive display.'

The researchers say pack leadership is well-established in wolves, where packs are typically led by a single breeding pair, but it is unclear whether groups of domestic dogs have a social hierarchy.

'These dogs have no breeding pair', said Dr Kubinyi.

'However, there are dogs who take the lead more often than others. On average, an individual took the role of the leader in a given pair in about three-quarters of the time.

'This ratio is of similar magnitude to the case of wild wolf packs with several breeding individuals.

'Using this qualitative data over longer time scales allows us to see the more subtle relationships that might otherwise be missed. Of course, hierarchies are likely to vary across breeds and individual groups, so we hope to use this technology on other animals in future to investigate further.'
