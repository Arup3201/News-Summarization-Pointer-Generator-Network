A distraught widow is begging callous thieves who stole her dead husband's ashes to return them back to her.

Dede Thomason stored her dead husband's ashes inside a white plastic box which she placed into a locked safe in her Marysville, Washington home.

But the widow was horrified when thieves ripped the 400-pound safe up from the ground and made off with the ashes and other valuables last month.

Bolts: Thieves ripped up the 400-pound safe and made off with the ashes and other valuables last month

Death: The thieves stole a box with the ashes of Clint Thomason, seen here, before his death

Thomason  told KOMO-TV in Seattle: ‘I don't think [the thieves] had any idea that's what they were taking. 

'But once they realized it, I think they should've found a way to get those back.’

She added: ‘We just want him back!'

Thieves broke down the large metal door to her garage on October 5, but did not trigger the house's alarm. 

Once inside, they not only stole her husband Clint's ashes but also grabbed precious jewels like Thomason's engagement ring and her grandmother’s engagement ring. 

Thomason and her husband  were married for 27 years and met in high school. 

They brought up two children together and lived in the house on 114th Street NE.

But after Clint died suddenly at the age of 52, she was forced to sell their house. 

She decided to  store her  valuables  - including family heirlooms and documents - in the safe  while people viewed the property.

She was using a simple white box to store  Clint's ashes in until she could find a more suitable urn.

She was convinced that the safe would be a secure location to put all of these things in because it was bolted down to the ground in her locked garage.

She soon realized that she was wrong.

Death: Clint died suddenly at the age of 52, his death forced the mom-of-two to sell their house

Home: Thomason  stored her valuables in the safe while people viewed the property, seen here, 

Thomason said: ‘It's just total devastation. It's just - everything that you had that you deemed precious was in that safe.’ 

Her family photos were gone, so were birth certificates, gift cards, old letters, cameras, a television set and Clint's remains. 

A day after the burglary, detectives identified a person of interest who was seen selling some of the items at an Everett pawn shop.

But when questioned, they denied that the items were stolen.

However, an employee at the store also found Clint's credit cards in the parking lot the same day. 

Garage: She was convinced that the safe was secure  because it was bolted down to the garage floor seen here,

‘I feel like I failed,’ she said. 

‘I failed to keep him safe, because that's my responsibility.’  

The family found large bolt cutters inside the garage, which were likely used to help pry the safe from the floor.    

The value of the stolen items exceeds $40,000. 

An investigation is ongoing. 

In happier times: Thomason said she feels like she failed to keep her husband's ashes safe since the burglary
