Following a botched execution earlier this year, the Oklahoma Department of Corrections announced today it would be renovating the state's death chamber. 

The biggest change is a new vein-finder that would make administering lethal injections easier for staff.

This all comes months after the troubled April 29 execution of Clayton Lockett, who writhed and moaned before he was declared dead 43 minutes after his execution began.

A report issued last week blamed Lockett's flawed lethal injection on poor placement of intravenous lines, as the medical team could not find suitable veins in his arms, legs, neck and feet. 

Botched death: The execution of Clayton Lockett was plagued with problems as a viable vein could not be found. Eventually, a line was inserted into his groin.

Ultimately, it was decided to insert the line into his groin. 

The execution was halted when prison officials noted the lethal injection drugs weren't being administered properly, with the doctor inside the death chamber reporting a single IV in Lockett's groin had became dislodged, and the lethal drugs were going into his tissue and leaking out of his body. 

This new device will make it easier for those administering injections to find viable veins.

'We are working hundreds of hours since that execution on rewriting this protocol,' said Oklahoma Corrections director Robert Patton, according to The Guardian. 

'We’ve reached out to several states around us and we’ve tried to take best practices from all the states that will talk to us. And I’m very confident moving forward in the process of executing inmates in the state of Oklahoma.'

Patton also said that upgrades to the death chamber will include new communication devices so government officials can know what's going on.

A four-time felon, Lockett was convicted of shooting 19-year-old Stephanie Nieman  and then watching as two accomplices buried her alive in Kay County, Oklahoma in 1999.

She and a friend had walked in on the men robbing a home. 

The next execution in the state of Oklahoma is scheduled for November.
