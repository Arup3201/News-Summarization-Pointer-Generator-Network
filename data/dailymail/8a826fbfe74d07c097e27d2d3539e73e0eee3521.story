A millionaire businessman’s family have told of their ordeal at the hands of crowbar-wielding thieves  who made off with valuables worth up to £700,000.

Four men in balaclavas broke into the £3.5million home and threatened to kill housewife Leigh Kempley, 50, and her children Ben, 16, and Abbi, 11.

In fear of his life, Ben was marched around the house by the thieves as they searched for valuables.

Scene: Four men donning balaclavas broke into this £3.5million country home near Harrogate, North Yorkshire

Victims: The gang threatened to kill housewife Leigh Kempley, 50, and her children Ben, 16, and Abbi, 11, before making off with valuables. Above, (clockwise from top left) David, James, Leigh, Ben, Ellie and Abbi Kempley

The gang’s haul included seven shotguns worth around £100,000 – three of which have been recovered.

They
 took a £250,000 diamond ring, a Rolex watch, another watch worth over 
£100,000, as well as earrings and a diamond necklace worn by Mrs 
Kempley.

The robbers then drove off in the family’s white Porsche 911, which was later found abandoned.

The
 family appealed for information to catch the gang on Monday’s BBC 
Crimewatch programme.

Mrs Kempley, whose husband David was away at the 
time, said: ‘For them to walk into my home and think it is OK to torture
 and abuse my kids is sick.

‘For
 me there isn’t a punishment bad enough for them, I want them to be as 
frightened as my kids were. They threatened to shoot Ben, to kill Ben. 
They are animals.’

The family’s ordeal began when the raiders broke in at 5.15pm on December 6.

They
 told Mrs Kempley they would shoot Ben – and told him they would kill 
his mother and sister to frighten them into co-operating. But the brave
 teenager kept calm.

The living room: The gang threatened to kill them all and marched terrified Ben around the house to force him to show them where the family's valuables and weapons were kept

‘I was terrified and kind of froze for a second. My first reaction was to run upstairs and find my younger sister,’ he said.

‘I
 had just got hold of her and then two men in balaclavas came upstairs, 
one armed with a crowbar, and they took us downstairs where my mum was.

‘They were threatening me, they initially said they would kill my mum and sister.’

The
 men collected the haul of guns and jewellery and locked their victims 
in the bathroom before driving off from the country house near 
Harrogate, North Yorkshire.

David
 Kempley, 51, the managing director of family firm Troy Foods, was in 
Wales at the time, the couple’s eldest son James, 20, was at work and 
their eldest daughter Ellie, 15, was out.

Mr
 Kempley said he has now had to make his home into a ‘fortress’ and 
added: ‘I want the people who have done this to go away for a long time. My wife was a happy out-going person who is now a shadow of her former 
self after this.’

Police have been following up ‘encouraging calls’ received after the Crimewatch programme.
