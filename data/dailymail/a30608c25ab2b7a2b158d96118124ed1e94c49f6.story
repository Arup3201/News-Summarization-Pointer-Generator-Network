Greedy: The former president of the Union of Democratic Mineworkers Neil
Greatrex stole £150,000 from a charity care home to do up his house

The former president of a mineworkers' union who stole almost £150,000 from a miners' charity to improve his home has been jailed for his 'calculated and sophisticated greed'.

Neil Greatrex, ex-Union of Democratic Mineworkers (UDM) president, was sentenced to four years for stealing money intended for a home for sick and retired miners.

Judge John Wait said the thefts, from Phoenix Nursing and Residential Home, were 'a breach of the highest degree of trust'.

Greatrex, 61, of Stanley, Nottinghamshire, spent £148,000 of the money on outside paving and new windows and doors for his home, as well as the home of co-director Mick Stevens, Birmingham Crown Court heard.

He was convicted of 14 theft charges earlier this month, while UDM general secretary Mr Stevens, accused of the same charges, was cleared.

Greatrex was a founder of the UDM in the 1984-85 miners' strike. The UDM, which was largely made up of Nottinghamshire miners, split from the National Union of Mineworkers after disagreeing with NUM president Arthur Scargill's leadership.

Trustee Greatrex stole the cash and spent £11,750 alone on a new kitchen, with much more going on new windows, doors and landscaping work at his house in Nottinghamshire.

Sentencing him yesterday Judge Wait said: 'As a trustee of the charity you were not entitled to profit from your role.

'Over the five year period you stole very nearly £150,000 from those you held office to protect.

'You have never accepted you did anything wrong despite the blatant breach of trust and procurement of false invoices.

'I reject as did the jury you had an honest belief that you were entitled to payment for your work at the Home. If you had had any such belief I have no doubt that you would have canvassed with advisors how such payment might be made.

'This was calculated and sophisticated greed. You used your influence with contractors to persuade them to provide false invoices, each of them knowing your position and no doubt hoping for further work.

'After the incorporation of the company you saw an opportunity to make personal profit at the expense of those less fortunate than yourself whose interest you had agreed as a trustee to protect.'

Mr Greatrex, from Stanley, Nottinghamshire, showed no emotion during his sentencing and waved to members of his family in the public gallery as he was led away to to prison.

Greatrex had spent more than 20 years in the National Union of Mineworkers before forming the UDM in 1985.

He became a controversial figure for speaking out against then president Arthur Scargill’s tactics in the 1985 strikes.

He formed the UDM claiming that nobody was speaking out for Nottinghamshire miners, prompting a great split between workers. In 1987 he was earning £67,000 a year in that role.

Christopher Sallon QC, defending Greatrex, said he was 'instrumental' in the sale of the Phoenix Home, which was bought for 1.65 million in 2007.

He said it would have fetched a higher price but Mr Greatrex had insisted that the staff would be kept on as a term of the sale.

Mr Sallon added that Mr Greatrex and his family had been subjected to harassment since the end of his trial earlier this month.

He said: 'Since his conviction he and members of his family have been the victims of sustained harassment, with unsolicited text messages containing threats demanding money for those from whom it was said to have been stolen, namely miners.

'Political animosity is now being channelled into these kinds of communications.'

The court heard that a police investigation into the alleged threats against Mr Greatrex and his family has been launched.

UDM general secretary Mick Stevens, who was accused of the same charges, was cleared by the jury.

A further hearing to decide issues of confiscation, compensation and costs will be held on June 29.
