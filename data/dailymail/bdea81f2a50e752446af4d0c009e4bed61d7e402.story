Letters between James Bond creator Ian Fleming and his friend Denis Hamilton have gone on sale for £160,000

As the creator of James Bond, Ian Fleming was a master of dreaming up death-defying situations from which the super-spy only just manages to escape.

But Fleming himself owed his life to the prompt actions of one of his closest friends who spotted he was having a major heart attack.

In previously unseen letters, published for the first time today, Fleming also admitted his impending marriage would cause a ‘Fleet Street sensation’ – and reveals that he regards the genteel pastime of gardening as a ‘death trap’.

Fleming’s intimate exchanges with his colleague Denis ‘CD’  Hamilton form part of an archive of more than 80 letters now on sale for £160,000.

In one note, dated April 19, 1961, Fleming told Hamilton, who was working alongside him at The Sunday Times, that he is now having to behave like an old man following his brush with death during an editorial meeting.

He writes: ‘Although neither of  us knew it I am afraid I was in the middle of a rather major heart attack this time last week.’

Fleming adds: ‘One never believes these things so I sat stupidly on trying to make intelligent comments about the thrilling new project about which I long to hear more. However, a thousand thanks for noticing my trouble so quickly and for shepherding me away when the time came.’

The two men had been friends for more than a decade by the time of Fleming’s heart attack.

In 1952, Fleming confided to Hamilton his plans to marry Ann Rothermere, the soon-to-be divorced wife of the 2nd Viscount Rothermere, who was then chairman of Associated Newspapers, owner of the Daily Mail.

He writes from his home in Chelsea: ‘CD – just so you won’t see it first in the public print. This is  to tell you that I am getting married to Ann Rothermere, which will cause something of a Fleet Street sensation I fear as the divorce goes into the lists next Wednesday.’

He adds: ‘In fact this has been on the cards for a long time. We have known each other for years. There are no hard feelings anywhere.’

Ann had first met Fleming in 1936, and had thought him, then aged 28, ‘a handsome, moody creature’.

Ann was later one of the most charismatic society hostesses, her house in Victoria Square becoming a renowned salon where  high society, artists and intellectuals mixed.

In his letter, Fleming assures Hamilton that Lord Kemsley, the then owner of The Sunday Times, has no problems with his relationship with the former wife of a rival newspaper magnate.

He writes: ‘So please calm down excitement at levels other than K [Kemsley] who knows and accepts with an apparent good grace.’

Fleming and Ann eventually married in 1952 and remained together until the author’s death from heart disease in August 1964.

Fleming died aged 56 on their son Caspar’s 12th birthday. In a touching letter, Ann tells Hamilton that her son, who later took his own life, was in turmoil. She wrote: ‘I was deeply touched by your letter to Caspar .  .  . Alas he refuses to answer as he says he refuses to owe anything to friends of his parents.

‘His present frame of mind is very distressing to me. I can only pray that it will alter. The only sign of grace is his unhappiness which I am powerless to help.’

Fleming, who joined The Sunday Times after serving as a wartime naval intelligence officer, continued as a journalist even when his career as a novelist took off.

By the time he formally quit the paper in 1961, he had written nine of his Bond novels, including Casino Royale and Live And Let Die.

The letters show also the dividing line between Fleming’s roles of  journalist and thriller writer could become obscured. On July 17, 1960, Harry Hodson, the then Sunday Times editor, criticised his profile of the German city of Hamburg because he thought it was too obsessed with its red-light district. He writes: ‘We have to remember that for a great many of our readers .  .  . prostitution is not even a necessary evil, but something entirely immoral and degrading.

‘Again striptease acts may be alright for callow youths, and frustrated middle-aged men, but are a vulgar .  .  . sort of entertainment for balanced people.’ Fleming’s journalist colleagues were keen to capitalise on the success of the Bond characters, and several letters deal with how the spy may be included in the paper.

On September 5, 1961, Fleming lobbies for an article on ‘the guns of James Bond’ even though he accepts it may bore female readers.

He refuses Hamilton’s request for a 1,000-word article about 007 himself which the editor feels would be more ‘bonne bouche’ to readers.

Just two months before his death, Fleming chastises Hamilton for wasting time in his garden.

A letter dated June 15, 1964, says: ‘I am sorry you have been playing the fool in the garden. You must know that all forms  of gardening are tantamount to suicide for the normal sedentary male. For heaven’s sake leave the whole business alone.’

The correspondence also shows that the friends could sometimes fall out. In one undated letter, Fleming criticises his friend for a particularly ‘harsh’ exchange of words.

He writes: ‘You were under great pressure so your wrath is excusable. But you should not use such words to a friend. They were unforgivable so I shall forget them.’

The correspondence has been acquired from Hamilton’s family by independent booksellers Bertram Rota. Owner Julian Rota said: ‘We are asking £160,000 for the letters which we do not consider an unreasonable amount. They show that the relationship between the two men became more relaxed and more intimate with the passing of time.’

Andrew Lycett, Fleming’s official biographer, said of the letters to Hamilton: ‘I think it was very much a mutual admiration society.

‘Ian Fleming was certainly a great fan of Hamilton’s and liked the fact that he had served with distinction during the war.’
