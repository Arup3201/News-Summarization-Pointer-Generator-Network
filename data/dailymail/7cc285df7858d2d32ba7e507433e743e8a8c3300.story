A woman whose genitals were mutilated by rogue doctor Graeme Reeves says he has been let 'off the hook', with a NSW court ruling he will not serve more time.

The gynaecologist was behind bars for just 18 months for maliciously inflicting grievous bodily harm on Carolyn DeWaegeneire with intent in 2002.

The former doctor, who worked in Bega on the state's south coast, surgically removed her clitoris and labia without consent during an operation on a pre-cancerous lesion.

Initially he was sentenced in the District Court to a minimum of two years for this and other offences, including aggravated indecent assault.

But in February last year the NSW Court of Criminal Appeal (CCA) found the sentence was 'manifestly inadequate' and jailed him for a further 18 months.

Reeves then appealed to the High Court and was released on parole on December 20.

In a further blow to Ms DeWaegeneire, the appeals court on Monday said although Reeves' original sentence was 'manifestly inadequate', his ill health meant it was not appropriate to intervene further with his sentence.

Reeves has chronic kidney disease and is on dialysis, the court heard.

In the months after he was released by the High Court, psychiatrist Dr Olav Nielssen found the former doctor had also experienced a relapse into a chronic depressive illness.

This was due to his 'disappointment at the lack of support from his family after his release, the progression of his kidney disease, the current circumstances of his detention and his anxiety about his future,' Dr Nielssen found.

Taking this into account, the CCA resentenced him to a minimum of three and a half years.

Reeves will remain on parole until his full sentence of five and a half years expires in May 2016.

Ms DeWaegeneire told reporters that when the CCA initially increased his sentence she thought 'maybe somebody is thinking about what he actually did'.

'Now I'm absolutely back to where I was before ... He's free, he's off the hook.'

In February last year it emerged that police had sifted through more than 100 complaints against Reeves.

However, months later, then NSW attorney-general Greg Smith said the allegations were not pursued because of 'insufficient evidence'.

Since he was jailed Reeves, who was struck off in 2004, has completed a Masters degree in medicine and human genetics.

Graeme Stephen Reeves first appointed as a visiting medical officer at Hornsby Ku-ring-gai Hospital in 1985, according to NSW Health Department documents

About 35 complaints were made over 20 different incidents about Mr Reevesâ€™s behaviour and clinical practice, starting on June 1986

Mr Reeves was banned from obstetrics in July 1997

Psychiatric reports, dating from 1996 to 2004, diagnosed him with a personality disorder and also said he prominent narcissistic features and was at times severely depressed

Reeves continued to practice obstetrics  in hospitals around NSW's south coast region hospitals from April 2002 to January 2003  and gynaecology until the termination of his contract in July 2003

There were complaints made at the end of 2002 about difficult working relationships between Reeves and staff at Pambula Hospital and by November 14, the hospital did not provide obstetric services

Then in 2003 similar complaints were received about Bega Hospital staff and Reeves, as well as obstetric services he provided to a patient at the hospital in January

He was found guilty by the District Court jury in 2011 for maliciously inflicting grievous bodily harm with intent on patient Carolyn DeWaegeneire after he mutilated her clitoris and labia without her consent during an operation to take out a pre-cancerous lesion in 2002. He was released from jail last December after serving just 18-months of his three-and-a-half year sentence.
