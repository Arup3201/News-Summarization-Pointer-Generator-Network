A resolution to Egypt’s ‘pharaoh president’ crisis is imminent, the justice minister said today.

President Mohammed Mursi’s decision to grant himself sweeping powers and place himself above the courts has triggered days of violent street protests.

In the Nile Delta city of Damanhoor, a 
teenager was killed when anti-Mursi protesters stormed the offices of 
the president’s fundamentalist Muslim Brotherhood party, Egypt’s most 
powerful political force.

Opposition activists have denounced Mursi's 
decrees as a blatant power grab, likening him to a ‘pharaoh’ and 
refusing to enter into dialogue with him.

But justice minister Ahmed Mekki, who
has been mediating between the courts and the presidency and was due to
meet members of the Supreme Judiciary Council today, said there was
hope of a breakthrough.

Mursi says his new powers are necessary to implement badly needed reforms and protect the transition to democracy.

The crisis has played out in 
street protests in cities, with the Health Ministry saying 444 people 
have been wounded nationwide since clashes erupted on Friday.

The decree was announced last week, fueling the violent nationwide protests and 
leading to a 9 percent drop in Egypt's stock market.

Both Mursi's supporters and his opponents have grown more entrenched in their potentially destabilising battle over the Islamist leader's decision with neither side appearing willing to back down.

Clashes between the two sides spilled
on to the streets yesterday for a third day since the president issued 
edicts that make him immune to oversight of any kind, including that of 
the courts.

The teenager 
was killed and at least 40 people were wounded when a group of 
anti-Mursi protesters tried to storm the local offices of the political 
arm of the president's Muslim Brotherhood in the Nile Delta city of 
Damanhoor, according to security officials.

It was the first reported death from the street battles that erupted across much of the nation on Friday - the day after President Mursi's announcement.

Officials identified the boy as 15-year-old Islam Hamdi Abdel-Maqsood.

The tensions also dealt a fresh blow to the economy, which has suffered due to the problems plaguing the Arab world's most populous nation since Mubarak's ousting.

Egypt's benchmark EGX30 stock index dropped 9.59 percentage points today in the first trading session since Mr Morsi issued his decrees.

The losses were among the biggest since the turbulent days and weeks immediately after Mubarak's demise in a popular uprising last year.

The loss in the value of shares was estimated at close to £3 billion.

The judiciary, the main target of the edicts, has pushed back, calling the decrees a power grab and an 'assault' on the branch's independence. Judges and prosecutors stayed away from many courts in Cairo and other cities yesterday.

But the nation's highest judicial body, the Supreme Judiciary Council, watered down its opposition to the decrees.

It told judges and prosecutors to return to work and announced that its members would meet Mr Mursi today to try to persuade him to restrict immunity to major state decisions like declaring war or martial law or breaking diplomatic relations with foreign nations.

Mursi supporters insist that the measures were necessary to prevent the courts, which already dissolved the elected lower house of parliament, from further holding up moves to stability by disbanding the assembly writing the new constitution, as judges were considering doing.

Both the parliament and the constitutional assembly are dominated by Islamists. Mr Mursi accuses Mubarak loyalists in the judiciary of seeking to thwart the revolution's goals and barred the judiciary from disbanding the constitutional assembly or parliament's upper house.

Opposition activists however, have been adamant since the crisis first erupted that they would not enter a dialogue with Mr Mursi's regime before the decrees are rescinded.

Protesters also clashed with police at Cairo's Tahrir Square, the birthplace of the mass protests that toppled Mubarak, and in the side streets and avenues leading off the plaza.

The Interior Ministry, which is in charge of the police, said 267 protesters had been arrested and 164 policemen injured since the unrest began a week ago, initially to mark the anniversary of street protests a year ago against the nation's then-military rulers. Forty-two protesters were killed in those demonstrations.

The ministry did not say how many protesters were injured in the latest clashes in Tahrir, but security officials put the figure at 260.

Hundreds of protesters staging a sit-in in Tahrir have vowed not to leave before Mr Mursi rescinds his decrees.

The two sides also have called for massive rival protests on Tuesday in Cairo, signalling a protracted struggle.

Mr Mursi's office issued an English-language statement last night, defending his decrees and repeating the argument he used when addressing supporters on Friday outside his Cairo palace - that they were designed to bolster the country's transition to democratic rule and dismantle Mubarak's old regime.

'The presidency reiterates the temporary nature of the said measures, which are not meant to concentrate powers,' it said.

The statement also pledged Mr Mursi's commitment to engaging all political forces on the drafting of a new constitution. Secular and Christian members withdrew from the panel drafting the document, alleging that the Islamists who dominate the body had hijacked the process to produce a charter with an Islamist slant.

Nader Omran, of the Brotherhood's Freedom and Justice party, said any changes to the decrees were 'out of the question'but Mr Mursi might 'make pledges, vows or addendums explaining his position to clarify the decrees'.

He said Mursi would hand over his legislative powers to parliament's upper chamber once a new constitution was adopted in a nationwide referendum and ahead of parliamentary elections.

The presidency did not confirm the claim, but doing so would leave the Egyptian leader with the state's executive and legislative powers until around April.

The move also has caused some internal discord among the Mursi camp, with one aide, Samer Marqous, already resigning to protest at the 'undemocratic' decree.

Leading Egyptian democracy advocate Mohammed ElBaradei, a Nobel Peace Laureate and a former director of the United Nations nuclear agency, warned yesterday of increasing turmoil that could potentially lead to the military stepping in unless Mr Mursi rescinded his new powers.
