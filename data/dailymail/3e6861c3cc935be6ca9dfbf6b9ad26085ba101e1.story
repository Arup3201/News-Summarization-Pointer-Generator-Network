Do you hate the thought of ever being parted from your beloved dog?

You may never have to thanks to a UK competition organised in South Korea that will clone your dog for free.

The winner of the contest will be flown to Seoul in South Korea to watch the process as part of a Channel 4 documentary to be aired next year.

Imagine never having to say goodbye to your pet dog. That is what is in store for one lucky British dog owner as a team of top scientists from Seoul, South Korea, are offering a once in a lifetime opportunity to clone 'man's best friend' for free

Taking just one microscopic skin cell, the team from Sooam Biotech claim they can recreate an exact clone of a dog canine in just two months.

Dr Woo Suk Hwang, the chief technical officer at Sooam Biotech, pioneered the technique in 2005. His group is currently the only company in the world that offers dog cloning commercially.

He has now successfully cloned at least 400 dogs - thought to be one of the most difficult animals to clone.

The process involves obtaining live cells from a living dog or a dog five days after it has died.

Dogs that have similar ovulation time are selected as egg donors and surrogate mothers.

Eggs
 are collected from the egg donor through a procedure called ‘flushing’ 
and the nuclei of the eggs, which contain DNA of the egg donor, is 
removed.

Then donor cell is then injected into the enucleated egg and the two cells are ‘fused’ together.

This fusion procedure produces a cloned embryo that is transferred into a surrogate dog.

The whole process takes less than a day but comes with a hefty price tag, at around $100,000 or £63,000 to clone one dog. 

Sooam Biotech has cloned highly trained rescue and police dogs for the South Korean government, as well as a number of highly prized pets in the US.

But the cloning of animals has been a source of controversy since the technique was pioneered in Scotland in 1996 with the birth of Dolly the sheep, the first mammal to be cloned.

John Woestendiek, the author of 'Dog, Inc.', a book about the dog cloning industry, says that the practice is centred in South Korea because there are much lower ethical standards for the treatment of dogs than in Europe and the United States.

'You can rent [dogs] from farmers for the laboratory and, hopefully, everything goes OK, return them to the farmer, but everything's not going to go OK.'

The author says that some of the dogs used in the cloning process as egg donors or surrogate mothers are later sent back to the farms where they are killed and eaten.

Dr Hwang, who is also the director of the UK Dog Cloning Competition said: ‘We can clone any breed, size or shape of canine and are coming to the UK to offer this process to the owner of one very special dog.

‘We welcome entries from any UK-based dog owner who wants to benefit from this exciting new advance in biotechnology.’

New Yorker Danielle Tarantola, who paid an incredible $50,000 for the procedure using pet Trouble's DNA last year, will also feature on the show. Pictured here is her cloned pup 'Double Trouble'

Ms Tarantola said: 'I really can see no difference between them. So many of their gestures and the way they play is identical'

The whole process will be filmed for a documentary by CB Films to be screened on Channel 4 next year.

New Yorker Danielle Tarantola, who paid an incredible $50,000 for the procedure using pet Trouble's DNA last year, will also feature on the show.

Ms Tarantola had been so upset by the death of her constant companion four years ago that she shelled out the massive fee so that she could have an identical replacement.

She said: 'He was like the child I never had - and I probably did treat him better than most people treat their children.'

Ms Tarantola, who named the new pup Double Trouble, added: ‘I really can see no difference between them. So many of their gestures and the way they play is identical.'

Applications to this unique competition are open now and close on 25th November 2013.
