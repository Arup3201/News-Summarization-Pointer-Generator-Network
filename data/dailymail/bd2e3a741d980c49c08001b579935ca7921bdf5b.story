Neil Hunt sent 'inappropriate' messages to the 16-year-old schoolgirl while teaching at the school in Wales 

A teacher who bombarded a 16-year-old pupil with drunken text messages was reported to school bosses when the teenager learned he had started an affair with a colleague.

Among the sordid messages exchanged by 46-year-old Neil Hunt and Pupil A was one in which he asked the girl: 'Have you ever been really turned on?'. 

The girl reported him to school bosses in May 2012, but he was allowed to keep his job at Queen Elizabeth High School in Carmarthen, Wales, for six months after telling police there had only been a 'handful' of messages.

When officers checked his phone again, they realised he had in fact sent hundreds of suggestive messages to the teenager late at night when he was drunk.

The hearing was told how he had a 'profound' effect on the girl whose exams suffered as a result of their relationship. Mr Neil was not her teacher, but is thought to have coached her at a local cycling club.

When the teenager was told he was having an affair with a female colleague, she told other staff at the school of their text messages. 

But when questioned, Mr Hunt told police and school staff there had only been a 'handful' of messages which he regretted sending. 

He was allowed to keep his job and was given a formal written warning. 

Headteacher Peter Spencer told the hearing: 'Had the true extent of text messages been known to me I would have dealt with the matter entirely differently.'  

The Professional Conduct Committee Hearing of the General Teaching Council for Wales heard how there was a 'sexual overtone' to the text messages. 

'The text messages had a sexual overtone,' Mr Spencer added. 

'I was concerned about the volume and content of them. They were not what you would expect from a pupil teacher relationship.' 

'There were 350 text messages sent between them and a number were inappropriate.' 

'He accepted full responsibility for sending the text messages, he said he had been drinking and he sent them in the early hours of the morning.

'He said he should never of send them but he had not sent other messages. He admitted it was a poor error of judgement and he accepted a final written warning."

'Police said that no further action would be taken.' 

The 46-year-old was able to keep his job after first telling investigators he had only sent one message while he was drunk 

'As the year went on Pupil A's emotional and mental health deteriorated.

'She said she had received significantly more text messages than originally reported.

'I believe she found it difficult to come to terms with what had happened because she couldn't understand why the police hadn’t discovered the number of text messages received.

'It became apparent that the police hadn't forensically examined her phone.'

'The effect on pupil A was profound, she did not know how to deal with the situation.  

'The issue with Mr Hunt severely affected her performance and her exam results suffered as a result.' 

The hearing heard Mr Hunt felt the girl was 'infatuated' with him while she believed the man was 'stalking her'. 

After hearing the teacher, with whom she was 'infatuated', was seeing a colleague, the teenager reported him to school bosses 

In one exchange, the teacher said he could not sleep as text messages had become 'interesting'. 

'Couldn’t sleep if I tried. Since the texts got interesting,' he wrote, before sending her another message the following day apologising for his behaviour. 

'My apologies for the texts last night. Too much Stella.'

In another text he said: 'You shouldn’t text me when I’m p***ed. Might say the wrong thing.' 

A statement read on behalf of the teacher said: 'I am now ashamed of my behaviour but I was not in control of my faculties.

'I have no recollection of this period in my life.

'Everything I can remember is mainly due to the help of my family and friends filling in the gaps.'

'I always conduct myself with the utmost integrity.' 

Mr Hunt admits unacceptable professional conduct by the number and content of the text messages, but denied acting dishonestly by failing to disclose the full extent of their contact. 

The hearing continues.
