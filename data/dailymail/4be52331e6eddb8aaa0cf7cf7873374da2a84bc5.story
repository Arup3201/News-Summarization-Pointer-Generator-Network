Most people are taught from a young age not to play with their food but one woman has turned the naughty habit into art.

Vanessa Dualib, 32, has spent four years crafting a range of animals out of various vegetables and fruits in her Sao Paulo studio in Brazil.

They include a friendly elephant carved out of potatoes and a red snake shaped out of a chillies.

Other creations are a breaching killer whale made from aubergine, fish crafted from pineapple and a pepper scorpion.

Vanessa, a photographer, has made over 120 images to date, with the project still ongoing.

She said: 'I see a fruit or vegetable that reminds me of an animal.

'After that I carve some of the details, add the googly eyes and take the shot.

Gold fish bowls: 'My proposal is always to try to challenge the perception of whoever is looking at my creations', Vanessa Dualib says

'I then sometimes create a backdrop scene in Photoshop to go better with the story I am trying to tell.

'I keep adding more almost on a weekly basis. Whenever I have the some spare time, I am working on this.'

Vanessa set upon the idea after deciding to combine her three favourite things - photography, food and humour.

She added: 'It can be quite challenging sometimes, but always in a good way.

'I work with a raw, perishable "media". And my proposal is always to try to challenge the perception of whoever is looking at my creations.

'The reaction has always been very, very positive. At the beginning this was a great surprise and one of the things that kept me working on this project.

'Somehow, I felt my work and my humour where able to lighten up the day of people I never met and probably never will.'

Vanessa has since created a book titled Brincando com a Comida - 'Playing with Food' - showcasing 52 of my creations.
