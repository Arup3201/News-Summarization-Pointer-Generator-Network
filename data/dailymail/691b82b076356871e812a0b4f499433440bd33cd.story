Found: Escaped prisoner Michal David Elliot was captured last night after a chase

A convicted murderer who escaped a maximum security prison by peeling two fences with his hands before kidnapping a woman at knife point and hijacking her Jeep has been captured.

Michael David Elliot, 40, was serving life for four killings committed when he escaped from the Ionia Correctional Facility in Michigan on Sunday night.

Authorities found Elliot in Indiana last night following a major manhunt. 

Officials were stunned by the killer's brazen escape, as he had a record of good behavior during his 20 years in custody.

He wore a white civilian kitchen uniform to evade security and blend in with snow at the western Michigan facility, prisons spokesman Russ Marlan said.

Prison fences were equipped with motion sensors to alert guards.

The fences also carry electric current to shock anyone that touches them.

'It appears that did not happen. ... He was not zapped with electricity, and he was not picked up by the motion sensors,' Marlan said.

Once outside the prison, Elliot, abducted a woman and stole her Jeep.

She escaped late Sunday when he stopped for gas in Middlebury, Indiana, some 100 miles to the south.

The woman told police that Elliot was 
armed with a box cutter and a hammer and had said he wanted to get as 
far from the Michigan prison as possible.

The woman's red Jeep was found abandoned nearby in Shipshewana yesterday.

Elliot attempted to buy water and medicine at the gas station, and then paid for $10 worth of gas almost entirely with change, WoodTV reported.

The
 woman, who is in her 50s, locked herself in the gas station bathroom 
and refused to come out, so Elliot took her vehicle and drove off 
without her.

It is understood she was not injured during the ordeal. Authorities put Ionia on lockdown as they searched for the fugitive.

'We had dog teams. We had a helicopter from the state police,' said Michigan Corrections Department Director Dan Heyns.

'The response was good, but he'd left the area by the time we were mobilized totally 100 percent. It didn't take him long to get down to Indiana.'

Elliot was serving life in prison without parole for fatally shooting four people and burning down their Gladwin County house on August 8, 1993 when he was 20 years old, according to court records.

Elliot and his accomplices were trying to steal money from a drug dealer, police said.

Vickie Currie, her boyfriend Michael Tuffnell, his brother Bruce 
Squires Tuffnell Jr. and Kathy Lane were killed.

He was arrested a few days later and had a gun that tied him to the slayings.

One of Elliot's co-defendants testified against him, saying he laughed about shooting the victims in the head.

Elliot was convicted of first-degree murder in 1994.
