They have taken very different routes to get there but Ernests Gulbis and Novak Djokovic will meet in the semi-finals of the French Open.

Gulbis followed up his victory over Roger Federer by thumping sixth seed Tomas Berdych 6-3 6-2 6-4 while Djokovic saw off Milos Raonic 7-5 7-6 (7/5) 6-4.

The pair have known each other for more than a decade dating back to their days at Niki Pilic’s academy in Munich.

Defeat: Gulbis beat sixth seed Tomas Berdych 6-3 6-2 6-4

Both had obvious talent but, while this will be Djokovic’s 15th semi-final from the last 16 grand slams, Gulbis will be playing in his first.

Had the 25-year-old Latvian followed his friend’s advice, it might have been a very different story.

'He was really professional already at that time,' Gulbis recalled of their time together in Germany.

'I remember we had a friend, a Croatian guy, who was all about the girls at that age already. He was dressing up. He was looking good, putting on perfume, sunglasses, going to talk to the girls.

'I see Novak, he’s going to stretch. And Novak told me that, ‘Yeah, you can have anybody, you can have all the girls in the world. But to be really successful in tennis, you need to (be professional)’.

'I remember it still. That’s a kid who is 15 years old. I didn’t forget. But I didn’t listen.'

Djokovic grinned as he remembered Gulbis as a teenager.

He said: 'He was always somebody that was very enthusiastic about everything in life and you could see he wanted to enjoy it with open arms, if I can say that (being) politically correct.

'He was always very talented. I remember he came out in the practices swinging fully through the ball. He didn’t really care too much. He respected his coach. He respected the players that he liked.

'The others, he just crushed on the court in practice and the tournaments as well. He always had this confidence about him that you could say that, even though he was 14, 15 at the time, he was going to become something big.'

Gulbis made the quarter-finals of the French Open in 2008 as a teenager and was already ranked in the top 100.

But until this tournament he had made it past the second round at a grand slam just once since and in 2012 he dropped back out of the top 100.

That was the nadir and over the past 18 months he has climbed rapidly, reaching a career-high of 17th in the rankings, which could well become single figures after this tournament.

Gulbis’ resurgence has come under Austrian coach Gunter Bresnik, who also looks after 20-year-old rising star Dominic Thiem.

Gulbis said of Bresnik: 'He didn’t deal with those kind of problems which my other coaches were dealing with three or four years ago.

'I missed a practice once with Gunter because I had a long night. I called him at 7am, and I said, "Gun, I cannot come to practice". He understood it. It was once.

'With other coaches, the first time when Hernan Gumy came to Latvia to prepare for Davis Cup; eight days of preparation, I missed five days of practice.

'And then you evolve, you start to understand, Okay, first, make one step. Don’t miss five days of practice. Just miss three days of practice and then two days and then one and then nothing. It’s a process.'

Impressive: No 18 seed Gulbis has already beaten Roger Federer and will be looking for another big scalp

Many players have a let down after a big win such as the Federer one, but Gulbis came out and played even better against Berdych.

He said: 'Today everything was good. I felt physically so good. I felt that I can run forever. I felt that he cannot make a winner. If I feel so confident from the baseline, then everything just comes together.'

Djokovic had a tougher time against Raonic, who took a set off him in Rome last month, and was delighted to complete the victory in straight sets.

'It’s never smooth against Milos or against any server of his calibre,” he said. “There are few guys that are serving this well.

'When he’s on, it’s very difficult to do anything except be mentally strong and consistent and try to wait for the opportunities. When they are presented, you better use them.'
