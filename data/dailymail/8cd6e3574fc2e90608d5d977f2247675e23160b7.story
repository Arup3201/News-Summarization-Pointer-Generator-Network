British taxpayers are donating thousands of pounds to pay Kenyan graffiti artists to spray murals.

Around £8,000 of public money is funding the Mtaani Initiative - part of a £6.7million aid project called Making All Voices Count.

Many of the artworks criticising politicians ahead of elections in Nairobi were sprayed over by officials in a matter of hours.

Organisers of the project claim the scheme aims to ‘engage with artists to spread data-based information in slums in order to empower citizens to make data-driven arguments’.

Andy Silvester of the Taxpayers’ Alliance said: ‘This is an utter waste of cash.

‘Foreign aid is supposed to help the world’s poorest - not subsidise graffiti artists. It’s unbelievalbe that the Government thinks hard pressed Brits should foot the bill for these ridiculous projects.’

A committee of MPs recently found that Britain spent £3.75billion of aid in the last two months of 2013 in a bid to meet spending targets.

The government has pledged to spend 0.7 perc cent of national income on aid - and will spend £12.6billion on aid this year.

The Department for International Development defended the graffiti scheme and the project, Making All Voices Count, which covers other projects including tackling police corruption in Liberia and improving maternity care in Nigeria.

It said the scheme helps ‘young people living in slums hold their government to account and have a say in the future of aid.’

The Mail has highlighted previous controversial aid projects, including the government funding a version of the Spice Girls in Ethiopia.
