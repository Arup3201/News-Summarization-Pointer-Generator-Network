Killer: Simon Tarry, 27, landed a devastating punch on John Millett, 34, outside a Manchester nightclub

A boxer who killed a man with a single punch during a brawl outside a nightclub has been jailed for five years.

Simon Tarry, 27, was 'spoiling for a fight' when he thumped John Millett in the face after an early-morning row about they way he had approached two women.

Mr Millett, a father of two, suffered catastrophic head injuries and died in hospital of his wounds a week after the attack in front of South, a night club in Manchester city centre.

A jury was told how, moments before the attack, Tarry threw a right hook at another man but missed, before throwing a bag of rubbish at a group of Mr Millett's friends.

At Manchester Crown Court Tarry, from Stretford, Greater Manchester, denied manslaughter but was convicted after a trial.

Judge David Stockdale QC told him: 'You were plainly spoiling for a fight - bouncing on your toes like a boxer. It is perhaps no coincidence that you are a former boxer.

'You knew how to move in a fight and knew how to punch and punch hard... You had the opportunity to move away but you chose not to do so. 

'In my judgement John Millett was intending to hit you - but that was what you wanted him to do. With the skill you learnt in the boxing ring, as he moved towards you you moved quickly forward towards him and threw a hard, well-aimed punch to the left-hand side of his head.

'You wanted a fight. You goaded John Millett into trying to hit you and he was no match for you. You ended his life. That is an event from which his family and friends will never recover.'

Tarry threw the fatal punch on January 24 this year. Mr Millett, who was known as Salford John on Manchester's nightclub scene, was celebrating a friend's birthday at the club.

Victim: Mr Millett, a father of two, was a well-known figure on the Manchester club scene, and had been telling Tarry to 'chill out' before he was struck

Tarry was seen approaching a group of women outside the club, which led to him being approached by an unnamed man. The court heard that he then threw a bag of rubbish at the man, prompting one of Mr Millett's friends to confront him about his behaviour.

When Mr Millett saw this he tried to intervene, which led to Tarry throwing the punch at his jaw.

John Wheeler, the friend whose birthday was being celebrated, said Mr Millett intervened because Mr Wheeler's sister was near Tarry, who was 'jumping around' aggressively.

He said the yob was walking backwards in front of him, 'ready to fight anyone who came towards him', saying 'come on then' as he urged him to 'chill out'.

Describing the fatal blow, he said: 'John kind of came alongside me, then I just heard this loud sort of slapping sound...I saw John go down.

'It happened really quickly. In hindsight it would've been ideal for me to get everyone together and say "there's going to be trouble, it's time to go home", and get everybody home safely.' 

When Tarry was approached by a PCSO he said 'I f*****d up. I hoped the kid's OK', and added: 'He was going to rush me'. The following day he told police he was acting in self-defence.

The court heard he had previous convictions for public order offences, criminal damage, assault and GBH, in which he punched a 28-year-old man and fractured his cheekbone. 

Mr Millett's sister Charlotte said: '100 years in jail wouldn't have been enough for Tarry. It's never going to bring John back. People need to think of their actions and the consequences that one punch can have. A lot of people don't realise when you punch someone you can kill them.'
