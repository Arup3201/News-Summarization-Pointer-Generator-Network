Burnley manager Sean Dyche believes that facing Chelsea in their Premier League opener is a 'double-edged sword' as he laughs off his 'Ginger Mourinho' nickname.

The sides meet at Turf Moor on Monday, with Dyche lining up opposite Jose Mourinho for the very first time.

It is a baptism of fire for Burnley in their first game back in the big time since 2010 following promotion from the Championship last season.

When asked about the nickname, Dyche said: 'I buzz off it! No, it's a bit of fun. They've called me some other names, too! It's a nice connection I have with the fans.

'They know the players are totally committed to the shirt and the cause. There is a great belief in the group, we are relentless in how we work and deliver.

When asked about facing Chelsea first up, however, he revealed that it was both a blessing and a curse.

He said: 'It's a double-edged sword playing Chelsea first but you play every team home and away. They have brilliant players and amazing power in the market. We know the challenge.

When asked about having a glass of wine with the man who inspired his nickname, he said: 'I'm sure I could interest Jose in a claret's claret.'

Dyche has made six summer signings as he looks to forge a squad capable of staying up this season. 

Lukas Jutkiewitcz arrived from Middlesbrough, Michael Kightly from Stoke, Marvin Sordell from Bolton, Matt Gilks from Blackpool, Matt Taylor from West Ham and Steven Reid from West Brom. 

Ahead of the opener, centre-back Jason Shackell said: 'We are looking forward to it. It's a big challenge and we are getting ready.' 

'It only feels like yesterday we were celebrating promotion. It's a chance to ply against the best players in the world.'

'You always hope to play at the top level, I was here when we were in the Premier League before and I am fortunate it's come again at Burnley'

'Our aim like all promoted sides is to stay up. It's a tough start but why not? You have to play everyone at some point and Turf Moor will be bouncing on Monday night. We are organised, we work hard and we ate looking forward to it.'
