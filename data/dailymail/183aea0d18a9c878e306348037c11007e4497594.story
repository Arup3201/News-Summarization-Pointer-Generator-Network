A cold spring storm is making it way eastward today after dumping heavy snow and freezing rain on several Western states canceling hundreds of flights, stranding motorists and knocking out power to thousands.

Officials in South Dakota warned residents to prepare for the absolute worst by staying home and keeping off roads as the system moved through the eastern part of the state after walloping other parts on Tuesday.

'We need to hunker down,' Sioux Falls Mayor Mike Huether said on Tuesday. 'This one is going to last a while.'

Aftermath: Icy branches partially block a city street and fall amid parked cars in Sioux Falls, South Dakota on Wednesday

Electricity remains out to thousands of people in the Sioux Falls area, and many schools and local government offices across the state remaining closed for another day today.

The weather service says 20 inches of snow fell in Rapid City on Tuesday â€” the city's snowiest day of all time. Other records also were set, including 1.42 inches of precipitation in Sioux Falls, a record for the date in that city.

The storm crawled eastward on Tuesday night from Colorado and Wyoming, with moderate snowfall forecast overnight from the Dakotas to Wisconsin.

In Nebraska, where strong winds caused a train derailment in the eastern part of the state earlier in the day, also was expecting more snow.

At the University of Nebraska Kearney, approximately 5,500 of books were seen propped open to dry after parts of their library's entire roof tore off from high winds, causing the books to get wet.

Freezing process: In all an estimated 5,500 books are said to have been soaked, requiring them to be sent to a refrigeration company to be frozen for drying purposes

Interestingly the books were sent to a
local refrigeration company to be frozen for the next few months, a 
process recommended by experts in helping them safely dry, according to 
University spokesperson Kelly Bartling.

'We're hopeful that we can let 
students in starting tomorrow to at least some portions of the 
building,' Ms Bartling told MailOnline.

Freezing rain, low temperatures and strong thunderstorms were forecast elsewhere in the Midwest.

Officials in Wyoming and South Dakota closed portions of major highways as blowing snow decreased visibility and freezing rain made roads treacherous. Up to a foot of snow fell in southwestern North Dakota on Monday, causing several vehicle accidents.

'Spring storms are not unusual, but they 
can be very dangerous,' said Greg Fuller, operations director for the 
Transportation Department.

April snowstorms aren't unusual in 
Wyoming and the Rocky Mountain West, but the storm comes after a rather 
tame winter in many areas.

The National Weather Service said Cheyenne's high of 12 degrees Tuesday was the coldest on record for April 9. The previous record was 23 degrees set in 1997.

'I'm pretty confident that this particular storm is more widespread and has caused more travel problems and closures than any storm we've had this calendar year certainly,' said Bruce Burrows, spokesman for the Wyoming Department of Transportation.

The storm hit California and Arizona on 
Monday with strong wind and rain, knocking out power to thousands and 
kicking up a dusty haze in the metropolitan Phoenix area.

It moved into Colorado, where two unconfirmed tornadoes were reported near Akron and strong gusts felled trees and power lines. More than six inches of snow fell at Denver International Airport, where hundreds of flights were cancelled and others were delayed.

Wind rolled a trailer home onto its top 
and a roof blew off a barn, Washington County undersheriff Jon Stivers 
said. A motorcycle dealership partially collapsed in Pueblo, Colo.,

In Wyoming's Sweetwater County, gusts up to 71 mph damaged a marina at Flaming Gorge Reservoir and broke windows at the Western Wyoming Community College in Rock Springs, according to the National Weather Service.

In parts of the Dakotas, officials cancelled classes and many local governments closed offices. In South Dakota, Secretary of State Jason Gant said more than two dozen cities and school districts informed him they were delaying elections for a week.

Up to a foot of snow fell in southwestern
North Dakota, along with freezing rain and sleet. An oil tanker crashed

Interstate 90 was closed between Rapid City and Sioux Falls, and transportation officials will determine which, if any, stretches can reopen.

Weather Service meteorologist Todd Heitkamp in Sioux Falls said that office had reports of ice accumulations from one-quarter of an inch up to nearly half an inch, leading to power outages and widespread tree damage. As much as 10 to 16 inches of snow was expected north and west of the city.

'That's going to add to the weight of the trees, to the power lines,' Heitkamp said. 'Then we get the wind on top of that and then we get the snow on top of that. You can envision what can possibly occur.'
