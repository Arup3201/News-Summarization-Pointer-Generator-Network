A toddler suffers from a rare genetic condition which means he cannot stop smiling.

Ollie Petherick, two, from Devizes, Wiltshire, was born with Angelman syndrome - a chromosome disorder which causes severe learning difficulties – and puts a permanent smile on his face.

Sufferers present a happy demeanour, so are often smiling or laughing, and tend to be easily excited.

Ollie Petherick (pictured with his mother, Annie Campbell) has Angelman syndrome - a rare genetic condition that means he has severe learning disabilities but that he is also always smiling

The condition is so rare that less than 1,000 cases have been reported in the UK.

Ollie’s mother, Annie Campbell, said: ‘Ollie’s smile and happy personality just makes everything worthwhile.

‘I can be seriously sleep deprived but his smile never fails to cheer me up - he has a knack of really making you feel his excitement and his giggle is just amazing.

‘The only thing any parent wants is for their child to be happy, and I know that with Ollie, I will always have that.’

Ms Campbell, 24, often receives compliments about her little boy’s beaming smile.

She said: ‘We get a lot of comments about his smile when we’re out which his lovely - it really does make you happy when you see his grin.

Ollie (pictured with his mother, Annie Campbell, and father, Iain) was diagnosed with Angelman syndrome after his mother noticed that he was not able to focus properly. There are only 1,000 known cases in the UK

‘He was a very relaxed and placid baby too - he’d always babble away to himself without a care in the world.’

Ms Campbell, who is now a full time carer for her son, only discovered Ollie’s condition when she noticed he couldn’t focus on things properly.

She said: ‘Ollie was six-months-old when I started to notice that his development was delayed - his older brother was much more advanced at his age.

‘Then, one evening, I spent hours trying to get him to follow my finger with his eyes, and he just couldn’t do it.

‘I really started to worry, so the next morning I went to the GP to be on the safe side.

Ollie's mother, Ms Campbell, says that people often comment on how lovely Ollie's smile is. She said: 'It really does make you happy when you see his grin'

Ms Campbell says that she knew Ollie had Angelman syndrome before he was officially diagnosed as she had read about the condition and all of his symptoms matched those she read about

‘We were referred to the hospital where they did eye tests, but we were eventually told that Ollie suffered from something neurological, but they weren’t quite sure what.’

Ms Campbell was then transferred to a second hospital where her little boy underwent more tests.

Meanwhile, she had come across Angelman syndrome in a magazine, and was convinced it was what her son suffered from.

She said: ‘I’d read an article in the magazine and the symptoms they were described were exactly the same as Ollie’s.

Ms Campbell said: 'It was a relief to finally get a diagnosis. I just wanted to learn as much as I could about it so I knew how to help Ollie'

‘I rang his dad straight away and told him that Ollie had Angelman - I was certain of it.

‘I just knew that’s what he had, and then two days later - six weeks after our first appointment - it was confirmed by the doctors.

‘By this point, I’d already convinced myself he had Angelman, so it was a relief to finally get a diagnosis. I just wanted to learn as much as I could about it so I knew how to help Ollie.

‘I went online and tried to find out as much as possible. I read that Angelman was to do with a deletion of a chromosome – it’s funny how such a tiny thing like that can affect someone so much.

Ms Campbell says that she worries about Ollie's future as he will not be able to walk or talk easily. However, she says that for now she just enjoys him as he is

‘I found support groups and other mum’s who had children with Angelman too, that’s how I got the most help and information.’

Ms Campbell added: ‘Ollie won’t be able to speak or walk with ease when he grows up which is upsetting.

‘I do worry about him in the future - I wonder how I’ll know if he is ever upset or sad, when the Angelman makes him so happy all the time.

‘But at the moment I just enjoy the lovely little boy that I have.’

Angelman syndrome is a rare genetic condition first identified in 1965 by a British doctor, Harry Angelman.

Dr Angelman had noticed similarities between a small number of previously undiagnosed children that seemed to indicate they had a common problem.

After seeing a painting in the Castelvecchio museum in Verona, Italy, entitled A Boy with a Puppet, he was inspired to write a medical paper titled Puppet Children.

The syndrome - originally called 'Happy Puppet Syndrome' because of the characteristic happy demeanour and stiff jerky movements of the children - was renamed Angelman syndrome in 1982.

Although at first little was known and indeed few other cases identified, in recent years much more has been learned.

During the 1980s advances in genetic medicine made it possible to diagnose increasing numbers of cases and also to start identifying the cause.

Most AS children are diagnosed between the ages of three and seven when the characteristic physical and behavioural features become evident.
