Arsene Wenger says his team will improve in 2015 after claiming that it is 'nearly impossible' that they will have as many injury problems in the next 12 months.

The Gunners have been struck with crisis after crisis this season, as key players in all positions have suffered injuries, something that Wenger puts down to so many of his stars taking part in the World Cup.

But the Arsenal boss is adamant that, with a full squad, his side will be better in the coming year.

Arsene Wenger claims his team will be better in 2015 if they avoid as many injuries as in the previous year

Mesut Ozil has been out since October, but should return in the new year as Arsenal's crisis begins to lift

Thirteen members of the Arsenal first team squad have had significant injuries this season:

Wojciech Szczesny (hip), David Ospina (thigh), Mathieu Debuchy (ankle), Kieran Gibbs (thigh), Laurent Koscielny (Achilles). Mikel Arteta (calf), Jack Wilshere (ankle), Mesut Ozil (knee), Theo Walcott (knee/groin), Aaron Ramsey (hamstring), Abou Diaby (various), Olivier Giroud (foot), Yaya Sanogo (calf)

'I feel it is nearly impossible that we will have the same bad luck on the injury front that we had in 2014,' said Wenger 

'What is explainable in 2014 is that it was after the World Cup and we had many players injured because they played in the World Cup.'

Three members of the Arsenal squad won the World Cup with Germany, but of that trio only Per Mertesacker has been able to hold down a first-team place.

Mesut Ozil suffered a dip in form before picking up a serious injury in October, while Lukas Podolski has failed to break into the first team this season.

'I feel we were very, very unlucky with the injuries we got,' continued Wenger. 'With the number of injuries we’ve had, we survived quite well. 

'But I believe, hopefully in the second part of the season, we’ll have more stability, especially defensively, to be more consistent.' 

Arsenal's injury problems are beginning to ease, with Theo Walcott and Tomas Rosicky fit again, while Laurent Koscielny returned against West Ham on Sunday.

Walcott could feature against Southampton on New Year's Day having been on the bench following his recovery from a groin problem, although striker Danny Welbeck, who scored against West Ham, will need to be assessed before the game.

Midfielder Aaron Ramsey is not just match fit as he continues to recover from a hamstring injury, but Czech playmaker Rosicky should return having been rested.

'Ramsey is not available yet, there is no setback, but it is a bit slower than I expected it to be,' added Wenger.

'Because he had a setback last year, we have to be very cautious with his thigh - he was out for three months, so we have to be a bit more cautious than we would like to be.'

Wenger accepts it is a difficult balance to keep all of his players fresh over the hectic Christmas schedule and also not lose the dynamic of the team.

'Rotation is a sensitive subject because you can destabilise your team with too much rotation, so you have to find the right numbers of rotating the team,' said Wenger.

'Overall, you want to keep the balance of your team and as well refresh sometimes in the positions where players are a bit tired.'

Arsenal could move back into the top four above Southampton with victory on Friday, and could close up on Manchester United, whom they now trail by only three points.

Wenger said: 'You give your best and if there is a weakness in front of you, you want to take advantage of it.

'I don't know if there will be any weakness in front of us, but what I know is that we can give our best until the end of the season to have a chance to do it.'
