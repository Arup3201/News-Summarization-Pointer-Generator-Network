The mother of the four-year-old boy who weighed just 8.3kg when he was discovered by police was 'too busy having sex' to properly care for her son, a court heard.

The 24-year-old woman told police she was preoccupied with her partner and put him before her toddler, who was discovered just days from death.

'I've messed up, I've done the wrong thing. I know I shouldn't have thought about my man before my son," she said, Channel 9 reported.

'I didn't associate with my child like I should have, instead I was too busy having sex with (her partner).'

Police sift through the squalor of the Adelaide home last year

An Adelaide court also hear the mother posted pictures to social media of her meals and dishes she had just cooked as her son starved in his bedroom.

While the boy, who cannot be named for legal reasons, was fed under his locked door and lived in a small room full of soiled nappies, pictures were posted on Facebook of her first attempt at cooking a roast lamb and a melted chocolate dessert, according to Channel 9.

The fact police even learned of the appalling conditions the boy, from Adelaide, was living in was 'completely fortuitous' because his mother only called them when her partner was assaulting her, the prosecution told the court. 

Doctors said the boy’s dehydration level was at 10 percent and was two days away from reaching a critical level of 15 percent. Prosecutors have called for a lengthy jail sentence after the 28-year-old father and the 24-year-old mother pleaded guilty to an aggravated charge of endangering their son's life. They will be sentenced in December.

Police had to wade through rubbish when they were called to the home last year to deal with a domestic incident

Earlier, the District Court in Adelaide heard the young victim, who is now in foster care, still hides food in his pockets, hates doors being closed and is not yet toilet trained.

Since being removed from his parents a year ago, the boy has had a significant number of decayed teeth removed and has limited language skills.

He cannot tolerate doors being closed and cannot control his emotions, sometimes punching himself in the head or running into walls.

A victim impact statement, compiled by authorities and the boy's foster parents, was read out in the District Court in Adelaide at the sentence hearing for his parents on Tuesday.

The victim impact statement said normal family outings were obviously new to the boy, who would not come out of his room for the first six months after his removal. 

When he woke up, he would lie in his bed waiting for someone to come into his room. 

In an earlier police interview, the father said the boy was kept in his bedroom for 12 days and fed under the door.

'We actually fed him pretty much every day, in that room, by sliding the plates under there, so far as we could hear, he was happy,' the boy's father said.
