It was bought by the King after he married Priscilla in 1967 and became one of his favourite cars to cruise around Memphis in - but Elvis Presley's red Cadillac  has sold for just £55,000.

The famous 1967 Coupe de Ville took the singer and his new wife from Las Vegas back to his Graceland mansion in Tennessee after their wedding.

The iconic couple regularly took the car to Elvis's 163-acre Circle G ranch in Mississippi where they spent some of their honeymoon. 

The 1967 Cadillac 1967 Coupe de Ville, owned by Elvis Presley was bought by a private collector at a sale in Las Vegas for just £55,000

It was bought by a private collector at a sale in Las Vegas held by classic car auctioneers Barrett Jackson on Thursday.

Elvis, who by that point was earning $1 million a movie, became known for his love of Cadillacs and would often splash out on the chrome-covered cars as gifts for friends and family.

He once even bought a Cadillac for a total stranger who he had spotted admiring his own car.

The red 1967 Coupe de Ville is said to have some of the best documentation of any of Elvis' cars, with registration papers clearly showing it listed as belonging to him and giving his address as Graceland, Memphis.

It was owned by American collector Mike Moon since 1979 and had been on display at The Elvis Museum in Pigeon Forge, Tennessee.

The mint condition motor boasts a huge 8-cylinder engine, a three-speed automatic gearbox and black leather interior.

Craig Jackson, director of Barrett Jackson, said: 'Elvis and Cadillacs go hand in hand - he was famous for the amount of Cadillacs he bought. 

'He bought a lot of Cadillacs for other people and gave a lot of them away too but this was one he kept for himself.

'People would see Elvis driving this car around Memphis. It was an important part of his life.

'It is pretty significant because it's the one he drove on his honeymoon with Priscilla. It's another piece of rock and roll history.

'It's got more documentation signed by Elvis than pretty much any other car he owned.

'This car has been in several museums over the years. It is unique because it hasn't been passed through private collectors until now.' 

The Las Vegas auction also featured the 1970 Rolls Royce given to Johnny Cash by ABC studios.
