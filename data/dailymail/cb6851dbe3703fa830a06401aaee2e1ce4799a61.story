Two young mums punched, spat at and pulled the hair of another mother in a fight over a ‘fat’ jibe outside their children's school.

Their victim, Kelly Giles, 35, was waiting to pick up her child from Merton Abbey Primary School in south London when she was confronted by Keyleigh Gore who claimed Miss Giles had called her ‘fat’ and insulted her daughter.

Gore, 25, shoved Miss Giles who fell back on to a low level wall, and then started punching her repeatedly.

Sasha Fisher, 21, first tried to break up the pair but ended up also assaulting Miss Giles by pushing her in the shoulder and hitting her in the face.

Gore and Fisher were found guilty of assault by beating after their claims of 'self-defence' were rejected by Wimbledon Magistrates' Court following the spat outside the school on March 12 this year.

Both women were made subject to a one year community order with six months supervision, and also ordered to complete 40 hours of unpaid work when they appeared at Lavender Hill Magistrates’ Court for sentencing.

Gore, wearing a tight flowery dress, was also told to pay £150 court costs and £150 compensation, while Fisher, sporting large silver hoop earrings, was ordered to cough up £150 costs and £50 compensation.

Claudius Taylor-Sonke, prosecuting, said: 'Ms Fisher and Ms Gore were walking along the road in the victim’s direction.

'Ms Gore pushed her and said "what are you looking at? You have nothing to say now".

'She pushed her over a low wall before starting to punch her.

'Ms Fisher approached and tried to get Ms Gore off her, but she continued to punch her. Ms Fisher then became involved and hit her. The two then walked away laughing.'

Following the attack, Ms Giles entered the school and reported the incident to the headteacher, before visiting her GP.

The court was told how the victim was left with extensive bruising to her lower back, arms and above her left eye as a result of the spat.

Gore, of Wimbledon, south London, admitted she had pushed Miss Giles to ‘get her off her’ after she claimed they became embroiled in a hair-pulling tussle.

Fisher, who lives in the same area, said she had broken up the two women and that she later hit Miss Giles in the face with her palm only because she had feared for her safety.

Both women have 'expressed remorse' over the attack and are sorry it took place outside the school, the court heard.

Hayley Brickell, in mitigation, said: 'Ms Gore is of a previous good character.

Sasha Fisher claimed she initially tried to break up the fight but later hit Miss Giles in the face in 'self defence'

'She has expressed remorse and accepts causing significant harm.

'She expresses she is sorry and admits it never should’ve occurred in front of a school and wouldn’t have wanted her child to see it.

'She has undertaken charity work in the past and is due to take a diploma in graphic and web design.

'Ms Fisher has a previous conviction from when she was a juvenile at 14 years of age.

'She felt bad for the victim, particularly when she saw photos of her. 

'She accepts it wasn’t right that she hit her and feels shame and embarrassment that it took place at the school her daughter attends.

Keyleigh Gore and Sasha Fisher were sentenced at Lavender Hill Magistrates' Court in south London

'She hasn’t had the best start in life with an unpleasant childhood. The factors she dealt with when growing up puts a different stance on how mature she is.

'It is not easy to be raised by a parent with alcohol dependency and have siblings with special needs.

'They are both mothers of young children who would be greatly affected by immediate imprisonment.'

Magistrates accepted the assault was a less severe offence which meant the women avoided a custodial sentence.
