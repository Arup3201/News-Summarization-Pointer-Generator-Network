Fellow NFL stars Tim Tebow and Tom Brady worried about Aaron Hernandez's behavior as early as 2011, according to a newly surfaced video.

Brady went as far as to describe the former New England Patriorts star, who was arrested last month for murder, as 'a lot to handle,' in the footage from NFL Films.

As well as lamenting Hernandez, Brady also refers to former Florida Gator Brandon Spikes with concern.

'And I'm trying to watch over Aaron and Brandon,' he says, to which Tebow responds: 'I appreciate that, too, man. They're good guys.' And Brady adds: '(Yeah) they're a lot to handle.'

Early fears: Fellow NFL stars Tim Tebow and Tom Brady worried about Aaron Hernandez's behavior as early as 2011, according to a newly surfaced video, pictured

The December 18, 2011, video, dug up by The Courant, is from Week 15 of the NFL season in Denver, when Brady's New England Patriots defeated the Tebow-led Denver Broncos 41-23.

Tebow and Brady are seen shaking hands after the game and talking briefly about Hernandez in the video, which also includes game highlights.

The two quarterbacks are very friendly in the footage, and it's clear they have had contact with each other off the field.

After some play, the video cuts to Tebow and Brady at midfield surrounded by press. The two shake hands and Brady compliments Tebow on his performance before discussing Hernandez.

'Good game, Tim. You're having a great year,' the elder man says. 'Thanks. I appreciate it,' Tebow responds and Brady adds: 'Keep it up. Good things happen to good people.'

The news of the long-forgotten about video comes as it emerged Hernandez has swapped his $1.3m mansion for a 7ft by 10ft grim prison cell where the other inmates think he is a 'punk'.

The former New England Patriots star, who was arrested last month for murder, is adjusting to life in the Bristol County House of Correction in Massachusetts, where he has less space than a bathroom in his old house.

He is locked down in solitary for 21 hours a day and is only allowed one hour of exercise a day in a cage-like pen with a guard watching him at all times.

His 6ft by 1inch frame is so large that he does not even fit on his standard issue metal bed.

And gone are his Patriots nutritional consultants to ensure he is eating the right food - in their place are unhealthy muffins, grits for breakfast and burritos for dinner.

Inside his prison cell - which he has
to keep neat at all times - is the metal bed with thin mattress, a 
pillow and a blanket, a combined toilet and sink with a seat that 
doesn’t fit and a small metal desk with a stool attached to it.

Each
day begins with breakfast at 6am for Inmate No. 174594, formerly No. 81
for the Patriots, said Bristol County Sheriff Thomas Hodgson.

He said: 'He'll get an egg - one egg, and a portion of grits.'

Nobody is asking Hernandez, 23, for autographs as prison guards have been told to treat him like anybody else.

Exercise cages: There are several exercise cages in the courtyard of the Bristol County House of Correction - this is where Hernandez gets to spend one hour a day outside to do pushups

‘He’d likely get a small muffin square and a choice between milk or juice. We actually serve Tang now to cut costs.

‘But believe it or not, it actually has a higher nutritional value than orange juice and it’s cheaper.’

For an extra refreshment Hernandez has to bend his head down and slurp out of the tap in the sink.

Other meals include a cheese burrito with bread and rice or rice and beans with green beans.

Each day Hernandez is allowed to leave his cell three times for an hour each time.

The
morning hour is to take a shower in a small stall and make some collect
phone calls. He also makes phone calls in his afternoon hour.

His exercise hour is at 5pm where he is led to the pen which is big enough for one inmate to do sit ups and press ups.

Meals: A recent lunch consisted of a burrito, bread, rice, and vegetables at the Bristol County House of Correction, where former New England Patriots player Aaron Hernandez is awaiting trial for first degree murder

Inside the facility: Hernandez spends 21 hours a day in a solitary 7ft by 10ft cell at Bristol County House of Correction (a common area pictured in the jail)

When he is in his cell he reads a lot
and was recently given a copy of Tuesdays With Morrie, the bestselling 
memoirs of writer Mitch Albom which has the words: ‘An old man, a young 
man, and life’s great lesson’ on the front cover.

In
jail Hernandez’s former $40m contract is worth nothing - the maximum 
amount of money he is allowed to have in his commissary account is $80.

And
because of fears he will be murdered by a gang member looking to make a
name for themselves, Hernandez has to be kept in a ‘special management 
unit’ - which is effectively solitary.

Hodgson said that so far Hernandez has been a model prisoner and seemed ‘very comfortable’ even on the day he arrived.

Nevertheless, the difference between his life then and his life now is stark.

Hodgson said: ‘Every Sunday he went into a stadium where thousands of people cheered him and revered him.

‘In an instant he walks through our door, gets a new uniform, a longer number, and nobody’s cheering for him.’

Hernandez
was arrested for the murder of his friend Odin Lloyd, 27, who was shot 
dead on June 17 at an industrial area near Hernandez’s home in North 
Attleboro, MA.

Prosecutors
have not revealed the motive for the killing other than say that Lloyd 
was associating with people Hernandez did not like.

Within 90 minutes of him being arrested he was dropped by the Patriots.

Hernandez
is also being investigated for having possible links to a separate 
double murder in Boston that left a third man wounded.

His
fall from grace has been all the more astonishing because he had been 
set for a bright future - Hernandez’ $12.5m signing bonus to extend his 
contract to five years was the largest ever that an NFL tight end had 
received.

The
Boston Globe reported that life inside the Bristol County House of 
Correction is about as far removed from such privilege as you can get.

One inmate told the newspaper: ‘He’s a punk’ whilst another called Hernandez a ‘bum’

He said: ‘I don’t care about him. I’m worried about myself.’
