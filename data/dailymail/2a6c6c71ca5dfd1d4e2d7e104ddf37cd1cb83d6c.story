The job description for the next FA chief executive surprisingly puts as the major priority winning the World Cups in 2022 and 2023.

This aim, detailed in the first paragraph of the recruitment advertisement, elevates women’s football, which has its flagship tournament a year after the men, to unprecedented heights.

It comes at a time when the women’s game is the fastest-growing team sport in the UK. The Wembley crowd for last month’s England v Germany women’s game — 55,000 — far surpassed the attendance of 40,181 when Roy Hodgson’s side played Norway in September.

FA chairman Greg Dyke is behind the focus on women's football, according to an FA spokesman

But such belated gender parity at the FA comes after it took their board 148 years to appoint their first female board member.

It is also puzzling the FA nominations panel should put such emphasis on Qatar 2022 when Euro 2020, with semi-finals and finals at Wembley, is widely regarded as England’s best opportunity to win a major tournament.

An FA spokesman said the stated ambitions reflect those of FA chairman Greg Dyke and the huge growth in women’s football.

The nine-month battle between Lord Coe and Sergey Bubka for the IAAF presidency began at the Olympic Congress in Monaco, with Bubka saying: ‘I do all my work only in athletics.’ This was a clear dig at Coe’s varied roles, but Bubka’s strong anti-drugs offensive has come late in his career while Coe has been campaigning on that subject since the 1980s.

Meanwhile, a notable face on Coe’s team is the respected Jan Paterson, director of Olympic relations at the BOA who was England chef de mission at the Commonwealth Games.

lAAF president Lamine Diack will not stand in the way of the ethics committee investigating the Russian doping scandal that has embroiled his son Papa Massata. Diack junior was exposed in a German TV documentary as having links with Singapore based company Black Tidings that was used as a slush fund to cover up payments to ensure serial positive drugs tests in Russia were not reported.

Papa Massata told German broadcasters ARD that he was involved commercially with the Chinese controller of Black Tidings. IAAF vice-president Lord Coe said: ‘Lamine will wait for the investigation and if names are in the fray then clearly those names are going to be subject of that investigation. Lamine’s not curtailing the work of the ethics committee.’

Lewis Hamilton, who no longer has a management team advising him, should have been told that staying for only 20 minutes at the Autosport awards evening partly sponsored by the world champion’s Mercedes outfit was a PR own goal. Former team-mate Jenson Button received a far more rapturous reception than Hamilton at the Grosvenor House Hotel.

Swimming, athletics and shooting are in danger of losing disciplines at Tokyo’s 2020 Olympics to make way for host city flexibility that might see the addition of baseball, softball, squash and karate.

However, the suggestion of Dick Pound, Canada’s IOC representative, that the triple jump and race walking were under threat didn’t impress Lord Coe, who described the former as ‘sacrosanct’ and race walking as being hugely popular in parts of the world

The 40 Olympic recommendations rubber-stamped at the IOC Congress were a triumph for new president Thomas Bach, who ensured all consultation and approval for the reforms were in place before the unanimous support he received on Monday. The way the IOC go about their business is the polar opposite of FIFA. Ironically, FIFA president and IOC member Sepp Blatter did not oppose the age limits introduced. Blatter said: ‘I am a team player with the IOC, but FIFA is a different team.’

The Premier League TV rights auction is not expected to be delayed by the Ofcom inquiry into Virgin Media’s complaint about the selling process. But any postponement might suit the Premier League with talk of gigantic mergers between Sky and Vodafone as well as BT Sport and O2 that would greatly add to the billion-pound bidding war chests.
