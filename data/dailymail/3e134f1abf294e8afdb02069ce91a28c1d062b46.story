Michael Karkoc, 94, pictured here in Minnesota in 1990, was a commander in a Nazi unit blamed for atrocities in the war, it emerged today

German prosecutors said Monday that they opened a formal preliminary investigation of a Minnesota man who was a commander of a Nazi-led unit during World War II, to determine whether there is enough evidence to bring charges and seek his extradition.

The Associated Press found that 94-year-old Michael Karkoc entered the U.S. in 1949 by lying to American authorities about his role in the SS-led Ukrainian Self Defense Legion, which is accused of torching villages and killing civilians in Poland.

Evidence indicates that Karkoc was in the area of the massacres, although no records link him directly to atrocities.

Kurt Schrimm, the head of the special German prosecutors' office responsible for investigating Nazi-era crimes, said prosecutors 'have opened a preliminary investigation procedure to examine the matter (and) seek documentation.'

Schrimm's office is responsible for determining whether there is enough evidence against alleged Nazi war criminals for state prosecutors to proceed with a full investigation and possible charges.

The only charges that can be brought in such cases are murder and accessory to murder, as all other offenses fall under the statute of limitations under German law.

Germany has taken the position that people involved in Nazi crimes must be prosecuted, no matter how old or infirm, as it did in the case of retired Ohio autoworker John Demjanjuk, who died last year at age 91 while appealing his conviction as a guard at the Sobibor death camp.

Poland's National Remembrance Institute, which investigates Nazi and Soviet crimes, has said prosecutors are reviewing files on Karkoc's unit for any evidence that would justify charges and an extradition request.

It says the files were gathered during separate investigations into the killings of civilians in the village of Chlaniow, in southeastern Poland, and into Nazi suppression of the 1944 Warsaw Uprising against German occupation.

Documentation shows that Karkoc's unit was involved in both.

Karkoc's son, Andriy Karkos, has said that his father 'was never a Nazi,' and pointed to the portion of the AP story that said records don't show Karkoc had a direct hand in war crimes.

He has said the family won't comment further until it has obtained its own documents and reviewed witnesses and sources.

A woman who answered the phone at Karkoc's Minneapolis home Monday refused to comment when a reporter from the Associated Press made contact.

One of the children who was at the scene of the 1944 massacre spoke to the Associated Press about her close call.

Henryka Jablonska's eyes well up as she recalls the moment more than six decades ago when a man in a dark uniform aimed a submachine gun at her. He pulled the trigger but the weapon wouldn't fire.

She lived, but 44 fellow villagers were killed when troops of the Nazi SS-led Ukrainian Self Defense Legion marched into this Polish farming community in July 1944 to exact revenge for an attack by resistance fighters that killed their German commander.

Survivors like Jablonska expressed bitterness that Karkoc had a quiet life in Minnesota for all these years.

'What good is it now?' she said of the
revelations. 'He is 94 and has spent so many years in peace and 
surrounded by his family.'

Jablonska's voice wavered as she 
recounted that day. The soldiers fanned out across the village, she 
said, shooting villagers, throwing grenades into buildings and torching 
homes filled with women and children.

A terrified 6-year-old, Jablonska 
stood in the dirt road with her parents and sister amid burning houses 
as the man in the dark uniform aimed at her a second time. Again, the 
submachine gun did not fire.

She watched, frozen with fear, as the soldier checked his gun and tried to shoot again.

'It was something so absolutely terrible,' Jablonska told AP at her modest farm house in southeastern Poland.

Poland's National Remembrance Institute, which prosecutes World War II crimes, had been aware of a commander named Karkoc from old records, but until the AP investigation had not known he was alive.

Following the AP report, the institute issued a statement quoting a 2005 article by one of its historians, Marcin Majewski, stating that Karkoc was 'the commander of the 2nd Company of Ukrainian Self-Defence Legion which participated, along with the entire Legion, in the pacification of Chlaniow and (the neighboring village of) Wladyslawin.'

One of Karkoc's subordinates, Teodozy Dak, was handed a 25-year prison term in Poland for his role in the Chlaniow massacre, and died in prison.
