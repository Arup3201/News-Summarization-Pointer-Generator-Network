Unnecessary: Valerie George shows a strand of cotton similar to the one which she dropped on the floor, landing her with a £75 fine

When a strand of cotton fell from one of her gloves as she was out shopping, Valerie George didn’t even notice.

So the 71-year-old grandmother was astonished when a council warden pointed out the thread on the pavement – and handed her a £75 spot fine for dropping litter.

‘I couldn’t believe my eyes,’ she said yesterday.

‘I’m just an ordinary grandmother out shopping, not a litter lout throwing rubbish around.’

Mrs George said that when the environmental enforcement officer first stopped her, she had protested her innocence.

But then he took her to the scene of the crime, showed her the curled-up strand of cotton, and issued the fine.

Yesterday, council officials continued to insist that an offence had been committed, but said they would no longer be demanding that Mrs George paid the penalty, which would have had to come out of her £105 weekly pension.

The pensioner said: ‘I wouldn’t have paid it anyway – I would rather have gone to court. It is ridiculous.’

Mrs George, the wife of a retired factory worker, was shopping in her home town of Brynmawr, near Ebbw Vale, South Wales, when she was stopped.

‘I had caught my watch on my glove and a piece of cotton had come off and fallen to the ground,’ she said.

Fine: Mrs George was handed the penalty by an over-zealous official

‘I didn’t notice. If I had I would have picked it up. I told the man it was a complete accident but he said it was still litter and to take the matter up in court.

‘It was a strand of cotton, not a cigarette butt. I can’t believe they would fine a pensioner for dropping something like that.

‘I asked the enforcement officer, who was burly and rude, “Are you really going to take £75 off an old age pensioner?”

‘I am a pensioner, I’ve worked all my life and I’ve never claimed anything. I live on my £105 pension – £75 is a big chunk of that for dropping a tiny piece of cotton.’

Her husband Les, 72, said: ‘My wife was very shaken by the whole thing.’

Blaenau Gwent Council yesterday confirmed that a fixed penalty fine had been issued for the piece of cotton but said it had withdrawn it after an investigation.

A spokesman said: ‘While we are satisfied an offence was committed, it is not in line with our priority of tackling litter more associated with affecting street cleanliness.’

In 2009, Kerrie-Anne Hickin, 30, was given a £75 fine after a tissue she was using to wipe her nose blew away in strong winds as she ran to catch a bus in Oldbury, West Midlands.

Last year, Nicola Bayston was threatened with a fine of up to £75,000 after putting up 1,000 posters around her home in South Hiendley, South Yorkshire, when her Patterdale terriers, Jess, five, and Bramble, three, disappeared.
