Alleged misconduct: Mary Gilles, 28, was arrested at her apartment in Austin, Minnesota, after allegedly engaging in a sexual relationship with an underage male student at Pacelli High School

A 28-year-old Catholic school teacher was fired this week after allegedly engaging in a sexual relationship with a 17-year-old male student.

According to court filings, police reviewed emails exchanged between math teacher Mary Gilles and the teenager and say several refer to her possibly carrying his child. 

Gilles was arrested Monday afternoon at her home in Austin on suspicion of third-degree criminal sexual conduct.

An assistant principal at Pacelli was the first to discover the student was having a sexual relationship with his teacher according to the Star Tribune.

When another staff member told Laura Marreel she saw Gilles and the student together in the auditorium 'at a late hour,' Marreel began looking into the teenager's emails.

Saying she had 'a gut feeling,' the school administrator combed through the student's school email account, where she says she found the password to his personal email account.

There she found emails with 'sexual relationship content' and a recent exchange of messages that 'referred to the defendant possibly being pregnant,' according to the criminal filing.

In court filings, Gilles admits to engaging in sexual activity with the student beginning in February. 

The two cut things off during the summer before starting again in September.

Gilles admitted to police in an interview that she knew her student was only 17 at the time of their relationship and said they had sex about once a month. 

Teacher: Gilles and her student were caught after a school staffer noticed they were spending time together at a late hour and the assistant principal searched through the student's personal email

The boy also spoke with police, telling investigators that he used a condom every time the two had sex from February to June, which he estimated was four or five times.

The relationship stopped when he left for summer break, only to continue once he returned in late August. 

Leaders at the diocese say it is their policy to try and identify any misconduct and immediately report it to authorities.

'Our prayers go out to those who have suffered child sexual abuse and who have been harmed,' the Diocese of Winona told KMSP in a statement.

Terminated: Gilles taught math at Pacelli High School. It was the school that reportedly tipped police off. Gilles was then fired following her arrest

'We encourage anyone with information regarding child sexual abuse to immediately report that information to law enforcement and we remain committed to protect all God's children.'

If convicted of criminal sexual conduct in the third degree, Gilles would face a maximum of 15 years prison or a fine of $30,000, or both.

An unrelated investigation is currently underway at Pacelli, as the board of trustees have suspended President Jim Humberge and Principal Mary Holtorf 'pending the results of an internal investigation related to their administrative functions.'

Allegations: Tennis coach Daniel Erik Hubbard-Wilson, 27 is said to have sexually assaulted a 16-year-old player on the team at Visitation School in Mendota Heights, Minnesota

Gilles's case was not even the first this week in which a Catholic school teacher in Minnesota was accused of having a sexual relationship with a student.

Dan Erik Hubbard-Wilson, the tennis coach at Visitation School in Mendota Heights, was charged with criminal sexual conduct after he admitted to a sexual relationship with a 16-year-old student.

Visitation is an all-girls school.

Hubbard Wilson allegedly told police he was 25 when the relationship began.
