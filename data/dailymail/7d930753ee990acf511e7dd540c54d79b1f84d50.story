JK Rowling officially opened The Anne Rowling Regenerative Neurology 
Clinic at the University of Edinburgh today.

The author of the Harry Potter series, who lost her 45-year-old mother to multiple sclerosis, was joined by Her Royal Highness, 
The Princess Royal at the event.

The centre will help patients with MS and other neurological diseases by looking to find treatments to slow their progression.

The centre - to which JK Rowling donated £10m - will deal with conditions such as multiple sclerosis, motor neurone disease, Huntington's disease and Parkinson's disease, as well as autism and early-onset Alzheimer's disease.

Speaking in a statement Ms Rowling, who wore a flattering red dress and dazzling jewellery, said: 'I 
am moved and elated to see the Anne Rowling Clinic formally opened today
by HRH The Princess Royal.

'Having
observed the plans for the clinic develop and expand to fulfil the 
needs of patients, clinicians and researchers, I am now very proud to 
see the building finished and operating as the beating heart of this 
centre for excellence.

'Thank you to everyone who has been involved in its creation and operation.'

The best-selling author was supported by The Princess Royal, who is Chancellor of Edinburgh University.

The Royal, who wore a smart brown suit, was given a tour of the clinic while 
both staff and students demonstrated the facilities and told her about 
current research projects at the University.

The Princess Royal, in her role as chancellor of the university, unveiled a plaque to mark the occasion and paid tribute to the 'exceptional support' Rowling has given to this field of research.

Anne told the gathering: 'It’s always a pleasure to see developments happening because this is a particular area of interest, as far as I’m concerned.

The facility, which was established with a £10 million donation from the Harry Potter author JK Rowling, was opened by Princess Anne

The multiple sclerosis research clinic is named after her late mother, who she tragically lost to the disease

'To be able to come (to the 
university) every now and again and really see what I consider to be 
step changes happening in an area which I think, to a degree, has been 
slightly below the horizon in the past is a huge encouragement.

'It’s
a huge encouragement for people like us but I hope it’s more 
encouraging to those who are patients now, for whom it is very much part
of their work. It’s their involvement which is making those step 
changes possible.'

She added: 'None of this happens 
without support and to have the exceptional support that we’ve had from 
Jo Rowling is quite astonishing.

'We’ve got to make the best use of that and I hope she will make sure that we do that.'

When
Rowling’s donation was announced three years ago, the writer said she 
believed the clinic would become a world centre for excellence in its 
field.

She said in 2010: 'I
have supported research into the cause and treatment of multiple 
sclerosis for many years now, but when I first saw the proposal for this
clinic, I knew that I had found a project more exciting, more 
innovative, and, I believe, more likely to succeed in unravelling the 
mysteries of MS than any other I had read about or been asked to fund.'

The
purpose-built facility is housed in the university’s Chancellor’s 
Building, next to Edinburgh Royal Infirmary at Little France.

JK Rowling was joined by University Principle Sir Timothy O'Shea at the centre, which will help patients with multiple sclerosis and other neurological diseases

Professor Siddharthan Chandran, 
professor of neurology and co-director of the clinic, said: 'We are 
delighted to officially open this clinic.

'All patients with these tough diseases need treatments that will slow, stop and ideally reverse damage.

'The
Anne Rowling Clinic will pioneer discovery science and innovative 
clinical research through strong partnerships with the NHS, academia and
industry around the world.

'Only
by better understanding the biological processes behind these 
devastating diseases can we identify new targets for potential therapies
and take them into clinical trials.'

Miss Rowling's mother Anne died six months after she started sketching the first tales of Harry Potter.

Her daughter never told her that she had started writing the stories that would eventually become a global phenomenon.

The children's writer told a BBC Scotland documentary which was screened in 2008 of her regrets over her mother's death in 1990, at just 45.

The 48-year-old
said: 'I started writing Harry six months before she died. That's 
obviously a real regret, because I never told her I was even writing it.

She knew I wanted to write - I'm not sure how seriously she took it.

She never knew anything about Harry Potter at all.'

Miss Rowling -  who is patron of the Multiple Sclerosis Society Scotland - witnessed her mother's gradual decline from the disease.

She explained: 'She had me very young. She had me when she was 20, so I was 25 when she died.

When I left home, she was walking unaided. By the time I graduated, she was in a wheelchair and in the house she needed a walking frame. It was awful to watch.'

Miss Rowling's mother was diagnosed in 1980 after numbness in her right arm made her visit a GP.

She is thought to have suffered from the disease for a further six or seven years beforehand.
