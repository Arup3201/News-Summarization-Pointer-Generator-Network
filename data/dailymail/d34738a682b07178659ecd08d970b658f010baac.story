A man who beat his partner for two hours until she was lying unconscious in a pool of blood has been spared jail.

Gary Parker, 26, dragged his 37-year-old girlfriend Melanie Adams around their home while her children cowered in fear upstairs.

The vicious attack was only stopped when Ms Adams' 12-year-old son managed to find a phone to call the police.

'Injustice': Melanie Adams, 37, has blasted the legal system after her partner was spared jail. She was left unconscious and covered in bruises when Gary Parker, 26, dragged and beat her around their home

Together: Gary Parker, 26, moved in with Ms Adams and her three children two months into their relationship

Parker was arrested at the property in Stoke-on-Trent, Staffordshire, after Ms Adams was found unconscious, covered in bruises with a suspected fractured wrist on the living room floor.

But today, the mother-of-three has hit out at the justice system as a court handed her attacker a 22-week sentence, suspended for 12 months.

Speaking outside court, Ms Adams said she has been denied justice.

She said: 'He thumped me and dragged me around. I was bruised from head-to-toe.

'Before the attack I was a happy, outgoing mother with a successful business and I was a very loving and loyal girlfriend to Gary.

'But there are no words to describe the pain and suffering I have gone through, physically, and emotionally since the assault.

'Gary Parker has broken me completely and some days I can't even string together a sentence.

'I truly believe anything less than jail is just not justice after what he put me and my children through.

'I just don't know what the future holds for me. My life will never be the same again.'

Parker, a chef, had been seeing Ms Adams for two months when he moved into the home she shares with her sons, aged 17 and 12, and daughter, six.

But on June 15 this year, they saw a different side to him when he accused Ms Adams of being in love with her ex.

Spared jail: Parker, a chef, was handed a 22-week sentence, suspended for 12 months under supervision

Melanie explained: 'He started accusing me of being in love with my ex.

'We were arguing about it for hours.

'Eventually he went to bed, but he stole my phone without me knowing and found something he didn't like.

'It was completely innocent but he just went mad.

'He beat me and knocked me unconscious. I was sick and there was blood everywhere.

'When the police came Gary stole my car keys and drove off to try and get away.

'I just couldn't believe what had just happened.

'I was so battered and in complete shock that the person I loved beyond words had done this to me.

'If it wasn't for my son who knows what could have happened.'

Defending Parker at North Staffordshire Justice Centre, John Kidney said: 'He's a young man of 26. He has no history of violence at all.

'He accepts the court ruling although he is disappointed. He is working extremely hard at his job as a chef.

'His relationship has gone and he's now been convicted of an offence of violence. His job is his only anchor to the future.

'He's aware he could be sent into custody and for him that would be catastrophic.'

He was ordered to complete a domestic violence workbook, carry out 120 hours of unpaid work and pay his victim £500 in compensation.

Shock: Ms Adams said she was so shocked she couldn't do anything until her 12-year-old son called the police

Sandra Horley CBE, chief executive of charity Refuge, said domestic violence was as serious as any other violent crime.

She added: 'My thoughts go out to Melanie as she starts to rebuild her life in the wake of this horrific assault.

'It takes a huge amount of courage to testify against a violent partner or ex-partner, and it is crucial that victims feel protected by having the full weight of the law behind them when they find the strength to take their abuser to court.

'Domestic violence must be treated just as seriously as any other violent crime.

'Gary Parker now needs to accept responsibility for his violence and take steps to change his behaviour. Using violence is a choice - there is no excuse.'

Polly Neate, chief executive of domestic abuse charity Women's Aid added: 'Domestic violence has a significant impact on the women who experience it: often leaving significant mental or physical health problems.

'This is because domestic violence is rarely a one-off incident of violence, and is usually part of a pattern of ongoing coercive and controlling behaviour.

'An abusive relationship can totally destroy a woman's self-confidence and sense of independence.

'Sentences for domestic violence must take into account this context of ongoing abuse, and should send the message that this kind of violence is never acceptable or a trivial thing.'
