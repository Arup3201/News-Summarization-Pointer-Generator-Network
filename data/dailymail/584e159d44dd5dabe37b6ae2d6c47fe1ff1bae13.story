German doctor Daniel Ubani caused the death of patient David Gray in Cambridgeshire in 2008 after he administered 10 times the normal dose of diamorphine. A new test is being introduced to make sure foreign doctors have a good grasp of English

Foreign doctors who want to work in the NHS will have to prove they speak good English before treating patients.

New checks have been announced by the Government after a string of cases in which overseas doctors were blamed for poor care.

The worst proved fatal, after a German doctor gave a lethal overdose to a pensioner on his first shift.

He had earlier been refused work due to his sub-standard English.

Doctors coming to Britain from outside Europe already face strict  language tests.

But at present, GPs and hospital doctors from countries in the European Union can work here without any national checks on their competence or language skills.

From April, new bodies of  GPs called clinical commissioning groups will have a legal duty to ensure that a doctor’s English is up to scratch before they are employed.

Practitioners will have to prove that they have a ‘necessary level’ of English before treating patients in GPs’ surgeries or hospitals, the Department of Health has said.

The General Medical Council has been pushing for tougher testing in the wake of the death of David Gray in Cambridgeshire in 2008. The 70-year-old was killed when Dr Daniel Ubani gave him 20 times the legal dose of morphine.

Health minister Dr Daniel Poulter says the stricter language tests for doctors will protect patients

The German doctor – on his first 
out-of-hours shift – had not had to prove his competence or ability with
English before being employed by the Cambridgeshire NHS trust. Dr Ubani
said he was confused by differences between drugs used here and in 
Germany.

He had previously been denied NHS work in Leeds because of his poor English.

Ministers plan to hand the GMC powers to stop doctors being given UK licences if  their communication skills are  a problem.

The Government will also introduce a 
national list which all GPs must be on to stop those rejected in one 
area from working elsewhere. Health minister Dr Dan Poulter said the 
measures were to protect patients who ‘should be able to understand and 
be understood by their doctor’.

He said: ‘These new checks will ensure all doctors who want to work in the NHS speak proficient English.

‘There are lots of excellent doctors from around the world in the NHS – this is simply about protecting patients.’

Niall Dickson, chief executive of the 
GMC, said the move will ‘strengthen patient safety’. He added: ‘Patients
must be confident their doctor has the right communications skills.

‘If doctors cannot speak  English to a safe standard  then the GMC must be able to protect patients.’

Katherine Murphy of the Patients 
Association said the changes are ‘welcome, and long overdue’. She added:
‘Lessons from the past serve to highlight the tragic consequences of 
poor language skills.’

Dean Royles of the NHS Employers 
organisation said that foreign doctors had made an ‘invaluable 
contribution’ but safety needed to be the ‘top priority’.
