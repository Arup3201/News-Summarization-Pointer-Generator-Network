North Korea's new leader gave his first public speech Sunday since taking power, portraying himself as a strong military chief unafraid of foreign powers as the army showed off what appeared to be a new long-range missile.

Kim Jong Un's lengthy speech - two days after North Korea launched a long-range rocket in defiance of international warnings - took North Koreans gathered at Kim Il Sung Square and before televisions across the country by surprise. His father, late leader Kim Jong Il, addressed the public only once during his lifetime.

Calm and measured, Kim Jong Un covered a wide range of topics, from foreign policy to the economy, as he spoke during choreographed festivities honoring the 100th birthday of his late grandfather, North Korea founder Kim Il Sung.

The rocket unveiled on Sunday, which appeared to have several stages, was similar to the one that broke into pieces over the Yellow Sea shortly after liftoff Friday, but was of a more overtly military design.

While it's not clear how powerful or 
significant this addition to the North Korean arsenal is - or whether it
was a mock-up - it signaled that North Korea will continue to build up 
its military despite the failed launch.

Although that launch was a huge, 
costly embarrassment, Kim's address Sunday was seen by analysts as an 
expression of confidence by the young leader meant to show that he is 
firmly in control.

Kim Jong Un's words often mirrored 
what North Korea regularly says in its state media, but there was 
symbolism in the images of the new leader, who is believed to be in his 
late 20s, addressing the country on state TV and then watching - and 
often laughing and gesturing in relaxed conversation with senior 
officials - as a parade of North Korean military troops and hardware 
marched by.

Outside analysts have raised worries 
about how the new leader, who has been seen but not publicly heard since
taking over after Kim Jong Il's December death, would govern a country 
that is building a nuclear weapons program and has previously threatened
Seoul and Washington with war.

The speech was a good 'first 
impression for his people and for the world,' said Hajime Izumi, a North
Korea expert at Japan's Shizuoka University. 'He demonstrated that he 
can speak in public fairly well, and at this stage that in itself - more
than what he actually said - is important. I think we might be seeing 
him speak in public more often, and show a different style than his 
father.'

Kim emphasized in his speech the 
importance of strengthening North Korea's defenses by placing the 
country's 'first, second and third' priorities on military might. 
However, he also made clear he is open to working with foreign countries
that do not have hostile policies toward his nation, and said he would 
strive to reunify Korea.

'It's a heartbreaking fact that our 
nation has been divided for more than 70 years,' he said. 'I will make 
painstaking efforts toward reunification.'

Kim also stressed the importance of 
national unity, calling his country 'Kim Il Sung's Korea' rather than 
North Korea. In recent days, the square bearing his grandfather's name 
has been redecorated, with the Marx and Lenin portraits that adorned key
buildings taken down and replaced with long red banners vowing to 
defend the new leader 'to the death.' At the front are portraits of the 
two late leaders, Kim Il Sung and Kim Jong Il.

'That suggests to me that they want to
let the country, and the world, know that this is a ''new'' country,' 
Han S. Park, a University of Georgia professor who works frequently with
top U.S. and North Korean officials, after watching the events in 
Pyongyang. 'In his speech today, he said ''we have a second century of 
Kim Il Sung Korea''.'

The young leader also underlined his 
commitment to aggressively building the economy and improving the 
people's daily lives, an approach backed up by a decision to promote two
economists to key Workers' Party posts earlier in the week.

North Korea has suffered decades of 
economic hardship following a famine in the mid-1990s and the loss of 
aid from the Soviet Union. Kim Jong Un's formal three-year succession 
has coincided with a push to improve the economy by employing modern 
technology.

North Korea is in the midst of two 
weeks of celebrations marking Kim Il Sung's birthday and the upcoming 
80th anniversary of the Korean People's Army. But it has also become a 
showcase of Kim Jong Un's new era of leadership, with Kim giving the 
world a taste of his foreign policy by firing the rocket Friday in 
defiance of outside criticism.

In a surprise admission, North Korea's
state media announced hours later that the bid to send a satellite into
space was a failure.

Condemnation abroad was swift, and the
launch - using the same type of rocket technology used for firing a 
long-range missile - raised concerns that a nuclear test might be next.

The finale in Sunday's military parade was the new long-range missile.

Military analysts in Japan and South 
Korea said further examination is needed to determine whether it was a 
new intercontinental ballistic missile that North Korea reportedly has 
been building.

The exact design could not immediately be confirmed by North Korean military officials.

Narushige Michishita, a North Korea 
military expert at Japan's National Graduate Institute for Policy 
Studies, said the missile appeared to be new but strongly resembled the 
rocket used on Friday and also the long-range Taepodong-2, which North 
Korea first launched, unsuccessfully, in 2006.

He said it probably has three stages 
but did not appear to be big enough to have the 15,000-kilometer 
(9,000-mile) range needed to effectively attack the United States, which
would be the goal of an ICBM for the North. Judging from the size of 
the soldiers in the background, its length appeared to be more than 30 
meters (100 feet), which would also be about the same or possibly a bit 
bigger than the rocket used on Friday.

'I don't think this is a serious 
ICBM,' Michishita said. 'Putting it on display has a psychological 
impact, and that would have been greater if Friday's launch had worked. 
But North Korea has a very bad record with long-range missiles. It think
this is more a propaganda ploy than a military advance.'

A number of North Koreans at the parade said it was the first time they had seen the new missile.

Kim Jong Un said in his speech that 
the era when nuclear arms could be used to threaten and blackmail his 
country was 'forever over.'

'Superiority in military technology is no longer monopolized by imperialists,' he said.

Kim Jong Un's speech was 'an 
expression of confidence,' said Kim Yeon-su of Korea National Defense 
University in South Korea. 'Kim Jong Un is trying to dispel lingering 
doubts about his grip on power.'
