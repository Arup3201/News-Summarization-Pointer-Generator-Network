David Cameron is to face the questions that MailOnline readers really want answered.

With the general election now just three months, the Prime Minister is to give his first interview to the world’s biggest newspaper website, and our readers get to choose the questions.

The Prime Minister, a regular reader of MailOnline, has agreed no subject is off limits as he sets out the Tory pitch to voters.

Ongoing wrangling between the party leaders mean the TV debates might not happen, or could become overwhelmed by the minor parties.

Mr Cameron has made clear he would rather get out across the country and address voters’ concerns directly.

MailOnline readers are now being asked to submit questions to the Conservative leader, and they will be put to him direct in an interview later this week.

Readers might want to ask him about education standards, NHS waiting times, Europe, welfare, foreign aid or the future of defence.

Or does he watch Benefits Street from his flat in Downing Street, would he have a pint with Nigel Farage and what did he think of Nick Clegg claiming he has wanted to ‘slap’ the Prime Minister 20 times?

Post your questions in the comments section and the best will be put to Mr Cameron in an exclusive interview with MailOnline later this week.
