The dramatic moment two planes almost collided on a runway in Barcelona has been captured on camera.

The footage reveals the near-miss between a Boeing 767 from Russian airline Utair and an Aerolineas Argentinas Airbus A340 at El Prat Airport in Spain.

It shows the Boeing coming in to land on the runway, making its final approach, as the Airbus, getting ready for a flight to Buenos Aires, taxis across its path.

Dramatic footage: The video shows the moment a aircraft was forced to abort its landing after another plane taxis across its path at Barcelona airport

The Boeing is forced to abort the landing, with the pilot carrying out an emergency 'go-around' procedure.

The jet, which had travelled from Russia, landed safely shortly afterwards.

The heart-stopping incident, which occurred on Saturday, was caught on camera by Miguel Angel, who posted the video to YouTube, where it has already been viewed more than one million times.

Angel, who has posted hundreds of plane videos online, said seeing the near-miss was 'one of the worst experiences I have ever had'. 

'Worst experiences ever': The Boeing 767 comes into land at the airport as the Airbus taxis across the runway

'Go-around': The Boeing pilot is forced to abort the landing, pulling up and going around the other plane

He explained: 'An Utair Boeing 767-300 (VQ-BSX) incoming from Moscow as UT5187 and Aerolíneas Argentinas Airbus A340-300 (LV-FPV) were involved into what could be the bigger disaster of Barcelona Airport.

'The Utair 767 was about to land on Runway 02 while the Argentinas was crossing the runway.

'By the time russian pilots sight Argentinas (they were taxiing to Holding point of RW25R for take-off) on runway while they were on final approach, they did their best making an impressive and close go around.

'After that incidence the plane landed safely on runway 02, and the Argentinas took-off heading Buenos Aires.' [sic]

Captain John Holmes, flight training manager at Ansett Aviation Training told www.smh.com.au there were three possible explanations for the error.

'The instructions to the A340 possibly were misunderstood by the captain, or they might not have heard or acknowledged the instructions, or there may have been no instruction issued from the control tower,' he said.

Spanish Airports and Air Navigation (AENA), the public body responsible for airports in Spain, released a statement saying there was never any danger of a collision as there was sufficient space to carry out a landing between the two planes. 

It comes just days after two planes narrowly averted a midair crash near the Bush Intercontinental Airport in Houston.

A Singapore Airlines Boeing 777 aircraft takes off from Changi airport in Singapore in 2011. A similar passenger plane nearly collided with another aircraft on Thursday in the skies over Houston

A Singapore Airlines jumbo 777 flew within 200 feet vertically and about a half-mile horizontally - about eight football fields - of a Delta Air Lines A320 just before 7pm on Thursday.

Air traffic controllers caught the error and corrected the planes' courses before they got any closer.

The incident took place about 10 miles northeast of the airport.

The Federal Aviation Administration, which requires aircraft to remain separated at least a half-mile vertically and three miles horizontally, is investigating the incident, the Houston Chronicle reported.
