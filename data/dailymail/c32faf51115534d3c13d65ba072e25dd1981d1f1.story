Either she was daydreaming or in a real hurry to pick up her prescription: This is the extraordinary moment an 84-year-old woman ploughed her car into a CVS pharmacy in Florida.

Margaret Underwood stunned clerks and shoppers when she inexplicably smashed her dark grey sedan through the Winter Haven store's automatic glass doors before narrowly missing an 80-year-old woman at the front counter.

When the car eventually came to a stop about 25 feet inside, according to a shop assistant, the wheels were still spinning.
