For many of us, a few simple images of our last holiday will suffice as mementos.

Perhaps we take a few quick snaps on our camera-phone and upload them to Instagram, perhaps we make a short video to capture a special moment – or perhaps we reel off an enormous range of photos, then leave them to capture digital dust on a memory card.

Standing at the edge of America: 'Riceman 2011' visits the USA's southernmost point at Key West

But for one particular tourist on a sight-seeing mission around the United States, such little travel fragments are not enough. Nowhere near enough.

Identified as ‘Riceman 2011’, this young trail-blazer has spent considerable time and effort on visiting all 50 states of the USA – and proving his arrival by standing in front of a recognisable landmark or backdrop, and filming a short burst of footage that captures him waving the American flag with a broad grin on his face.

Patriotic stuff, we can agree.

The trip was completed last month, with ‘Riceman 2011’ announcing that it was ‘shown in the spirit of Independence Day’.

His journey seems to have been all-encompassing, making sure to venture to the furthest corners of American territory – including the sun-kissed confines of Oahu, in Hawaii, and the frozen contours of Alaska, in the height of winter.

He is also pictured standing at the monument which marks the southernmost point of the USA – at the lowest edge of Key West in Florida.

The Alaska leg of the odyssey was clearly the most demanding, the footage showing ‘Riceman 2011’ grimacing in sub-zero temperatures as snow billows around him.

Although the extent of his travels is apparent, he gives away little about himself except to reveal that he hails from Texas.

‘The stars at night are big and bright, deep in the heart of TEXAS!’ he says of his home patch – before adding: ‘But I love all the states.’
