A killer who boasted of being 'judge, jury and executioner' after knifing a friend of his girlfriend in a jealous rage has been jailed for life.

Wesley Isherwood beat and stabbed former insurance agent Brian Gavigan, 48, at his home in Prestwich, Manchester.

Mr Gavigan had been volunteering as a 'Good Samaritan' at a hostel where Isherwood was staying, when he struck up an entirely innocent friendship with the thug's girlfriend Adele Eckersley.

But the relationship sparked a murderous rage in Isherwood - a man 'driven by obsessive sexual 
jealousy' - who had a history of violent offending.

Hours before killing vulnerable Mr Gavigan, Isherwood, 28, told him to stay away from his girlfriend.

He then stole a phone and a set of knives from his victim before returning to his home later that night in September, last year, with one of the blades.

He savagely beat his defenceless victim, then attempted to strangle him, before cutting his throat and stabbing him in the abdomen.

While awaiting trial for murder, Isherwood made a chilling boast in a letter to Miss Eckersley from his prison cell.

He wrote: ‘I don't feel a damn thing for him or his family... The truth is I'm glad he's dead. He committed a crime that was punishable by death.

'I live my life by my own rules, my own laws. When people break them, I become judge, jury and once again in this case I became executioner as well.

‘I haven't lost a minute's sleep since it happened... you know me, I'm a highly violent and volatile person.’

Isherwood, of Prestwich, looked stunned and he was told he must serve 24 years and 192 days behind bars, after pleading guilty to the murder.

Sentencing, Judge Andrew Gilbart QC 
said the crime was aggravated by Isherwood's record for violence, the 
planning that went into it and the fact he had regarded his victim as 
vulnerable.

He said: ‘It 
was a sustained savage attack by a man driven by obsessive sexual 
jealousy.

'You inflicted a terrible and savage beating upon (Mr Gavigan),
which left him screaming before you finished him off.’

Mark Ford, mitigating, told the court that his client's behaviour in the immediate aftermath of the crime showed remorse.

He said the murderer had difficulty coming to terms with what he had done and had been 'seeking to disguise' his feelings in the damning letter.

Following sentencing, senior investigating officer Andy Tattersall, said: ‘I hope this sentencing provides the victim's family and friends with some sense of justice although they will never be able to fill the hole in their hearts that has been left following his untimely death.’

At the time of his murder, his family said: ‘His untimely death will leave a big hole in the hearts of all his family and friends. Brian should not have died in these circumstances and he will be greatly missed.’
