Under-fire Tottenham manager Andre Villas-Boas survived a crisis meeting with chairman Daniel Levy and technical director Franco Baldini after Spursâ€™ 5-0 humbling at home to Liverpool.

Despite backing from Levy in the highly-charged meeting, they are short-term guarantees and Villas-Boas knows he could be sacked at a moment's notice. The Spurs chairman is already sounding out potential replacements.

Villas-Boas plummeted in the betting markets for next Premier League manager to be shown the door after the defeat, which came just three weeks after the 6-0 thrashing at Manchester City.

Levy is already lining up a successor 
to Villas-Boas - possibly in the form of a temporary manager - and will 
axe the former Chelsea boss if he can secure his man.

The Spurs chairman is understood to be 
sounding out potential replacements and Sportsmail has learnt that the 
Tottenham chairman favours an experienced coach with World Cup pedigree.
 Fabio Capello, who was at White Hart Lane on Sunday performing TV 
duties, out-of-work Gus Hiddink and Glenn Hoddle and three high-profile 
names in the frame.

However, Villas-Boas pledged not to resign, despite admitting he has never faced a 
worse home loss in his career than the drubbing at the hands of Brendan Rodgers' rampant Reds.

Liverpool captain Luis Suarez ran wild at White Hart Lane, scoring twice and having a hand in the goals for Jordan Henderson, John Flanagan and Raheem Sterling.

And the Portuguese refused to give up on a top-four Premier League finish.

Asked how much time he would be given at Spurs, Villas-Boas said: 'That's the only thing I can't control, it's not my call so I can't say anything else.

'I have to get down to work, that's the only thing I can focus on.

'The call to make that decision is not mine, because obviously I won't resign and I'm not a quitter.

'The only thing I can do is work hard with the players to get them back on track.

'This is a top-four squad but in our Premier League form we are not there.

'It's not the points tally that's the problem, it's the expression of the results.

'It's
 the second expressive scoreline that we've suffered in the season, and 
we admit that in the Premier League things aren't going in any shape or 
form the way we want.

'All of us had high expectations for this season, we still have them. Again I repeat that we are not far off, but the distance is increasing for those Champions League spots.

'And because of the expressive result it makes it even more difficult for us to bounce back.'

Villas-Boas 
offered no argument with defeat, but felt Paulinho's second-half red 
card allowed Liverpool to pile on the goals, and the misery.

Confirming he would try to appeal that red card, Villas-Boas labelled the decision 'an extremely poor call'.

He said: 'I think it was a bit harsh because I don't think there was intention to hurt Suarez.

'His
 foot was high, definitely a yellow card, but a straight red I think is a
 bit too much, because Paulinho is not that type of player.

'I think it was an extremely poor call that has an influence, not on the victory of Liverpool but on the expressive result.

'I will try (to appeal the red card), hopefully there can be some sensitivity into it.'

Liverpool
 manager Rodgers heaped praised on striker Luis Suarez, hinting that 
captaincy can bring the best out of the prolific Uruguay forward.

Suarez's
 brace took his Premier League goals tally to 17 for the season, but 
Rodgers was most concerned with his leadership skills.

Rodgers said: 'This is a guy who has captained one of the most iconic clubs in 
European football in Ajax, so it's nothing new to him.

'I wanted to have someone who could represent me and the club in that tunnel, before even stepping on the pitch.

'When Luis Suarez has the armband on ready to go out, everyone knows this is a team ready to fight.

'He was great in the changing room, I told him a few days back I wanted him to lead this club and that it was an honour for him.

'I think he enjoyed it and today you've seen his performance level.'

Hailing his side's dominance in every area, Rodgers said: 'I loved their arrogance with the ball today.

'They were a real threat with the ball all day.

'In winning teams everyone supports each other, and this was a result achieved without our captain Steven Gerrard.

'When we have that focus and concentration we're a very good side.'
