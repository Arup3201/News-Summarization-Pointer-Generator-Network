A New York rapper was arrested Thursday for allegedly attacking and robbing two vendors who were selling trademarked T-Shirts outside a California concert venue where he was headlining.

Felipe Coronel, 37, known as Harlem rapper 'Immortal Technique,' and his tour manager Steven McDaniel, 40, were arrested after the sold-out show at The Observatory in Orange County Thursday and charged with robbery and attempting to prevent/dissuade a victim from reporting a crime.

The two were identified as two of 10 to 12 men who beat the two vendors and stole their cash, T-shirts, and cell phones, according to the Santa Ana Police department.

Confronted: The vendors were reportedly selling the T-shirts outside of the venue when they were confronted by the rapper's entourage over a dispute that Coronel was not receiving any profits from the T-shirt sales

The vendors were reportedly selling the T-shirts outside of the venue  where Coronel was performing with rapper Talib Kweli when they were confronted by the rapper and his entourage over a dispute that Coronel was not receiving any profits from the T-shirt sales.

Santa Ana police told NBC that the two were arrested after the show because officers did not want to 'go in there, shut the concert down and then have additional issues.'

Coronel was released Friday after posting $50,000 bail. McDaniel was released a few minutes earlier, NBC reports. The two were back on tour that night.

Coronel took to Twitter after the incident tweeting that he would make an official statement soon.

He tweeted that the 'convoluted' media coverage of the incident 'was instrumental' in uniting him with loved ones with whom he had lost touch with. He also posted the message to his Facebook page.

Kweli also voiced his opinion about the Santa Ana PD calling the department 'incompetent' claiming officers arrested McDaniel for a crime he did not commit. 

The rapper boasts millions of followers on social media sites and became a Harlem favorite in the early 2000's with his debut album Revolutionary Vol. 1. 

He reportedly has a lengthy rap sheet including multiple assault charges, according to Viper records.
