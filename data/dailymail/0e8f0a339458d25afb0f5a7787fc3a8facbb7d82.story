Council bosses were forced to apologise today after a mother-of-two was handed a parking ticket while breastfeeding her baby daughter in her car.

Antonia Charlesworth, 27, was driving home from a shopping trip in Queen Street, Blackpool, when her five-month-old daughter started screaming to be fed.

She pulled over and began to breastfeed her baby - without realising she had actually parked in a taxi rank.

However, she then spotted a parking warden approach her car, before checking her tax disc and taking photographs of the vehicle. 

Realising she had pulled into a taxi rank, Ms Charlesworth quickly apologised and offered to move her car - but she was then handed a £35 ticket.

Today, the mother, whose two-year-old daughter was also in the vehicle, said the incident had left her feeling 'humiliated'.

'I asked him if he could do the decent thing and allow me to finish feeding my baby or at least allow me to move my car,' she said.

'But he refused and instead started taking photographs of my vehicle, which I think would have included me.

Response: Bosses at Blackpool Council (pictured) apologised today and agreed to revoke the parking ticket

Ms Charlesworth's five-month-old daughter was 'screaming because her feed had been interrupted.' 'All with my breast exposed and in front of passers-by,' Ms Charlesworth said. 

Blackpool Council, which runs a Breatfeeding Welcome scheme to encourage new mothers to feel confident about breastfeeding in public, apologised today and agreed to revoke the ticket.

'We are very sorry this unfortunate situation has arisen,' said a council spokesman.

'We strongly support breastfeeding and as a gesture of goodwill agree to waive the penalty notice.'

But the spokesman added that the ticket had been issued correctly - and the warden had behaved in a 'professional' and 'courteous' manner.

Meanwhile, a spokesman for the Breastfeeding Network, which offers support and information for new mothers, said: 'Breastfeeding is a normal part of life.

'We hope that breastfeeding mothers and their babies will be treated with the same respect as everyone else.'
