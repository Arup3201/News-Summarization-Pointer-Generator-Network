The artistic director of the Bolshoi Ballet is now almost completely blind after 18 operations failed to save his sight following an acid attack earlier this year.

Sergei Filin, 42,  was left with severe burns to his eyes and face when a masked attacker threw a jar of sulphuric acid in his face as he was returning home late on January 17.

He flew to Germany from Moscow for treatment in March, but despite initial optimistic reports, he has now lost 95 per cent of his vision and is totally blind in his right eye.

A spokeswoman for the Bolshoi told The Times yesterday: 'He is now blind in his right eye. The problem is that it is acid and it continues to cause damage. He has had 18 operations and I understand that some of them were very difficult.'

She said that his facial burns had almost completely healed and his hair had grown back.

The spokeswoman also said that he continues to speak regularly on company business to Galina Stepanenko, who has been standing in for him.

The dancer: Pavel Dmitrichenko, 29, - known as 'Ivan the Terrible' for his talent for playing ballet villains - was remanded in custody until at least June 18 as the probe goes on into the scandal

The Bolshoi, one of Russia's best-known 
cultural symbols, filed two reprimands against Tsiskaridze for giving 
unauthorised interviews after the attack on Mr Filin.

When he arrived at Aachen University Clinic, Mr Filin said he was 'full of strength and faith' that he will eventually see well enough to return to work at the famed Moscow theatre.

But it appears his progress has now stalled and the prognosis for his sight is now bleak.

Pavel Dmitrichenko, 29, - known as 'Ivan
the Terrible' for his talent for playing ballet villains - is accused 
of paying a 'hitman' £1,080 to attack Sergei Filin after his girlfriend was snubbed for a role.

But
while Dmitrichenko has admitted ordering the attack, he argues he only 
wanted Filin 'beaten up' and did not sanction the use of sulphuric
acid.

An alleged accomplice, Yuri Zarutsky, is 
accused of accepting 50,000 roubles, around £1,080, from Dmitrichenko to
attack Mr Filin.

In April a judge in Moscow rejected his
plea to be released on bail pending the results of a police 
investigation, deeming him a flight risk.

He was remanded in custody until at least June 18 as the probe goes on into the scandal.

As the biggest scandal in the history of
Russian ballet, the case has gripped Russia as revelations exposing the
internal rifts tearing the classical dance world apart as well as a 
string of murky sub-plots.

Police claim Dmitrichenko  was motivated by fury at Filin for snubbing his girlfriend, 21-year-old Anzhelina Vorontsova.

'The
main reason he gave to the investigator is revenge,' a police source 
told Russian newspaper Izvestia. 'Filin did not let her play leading dancing roles in the 
Bolshoi.'

But Dmitrichenko 
- who faces up to 12 years in jail if found guilty - claimed at an earlier court hearing 
that he was horrified when he realised that acid was used in the 17 
January attack on Filin.

'When I heard what happened to Sergei, I was just in shock,' he said.

'I could not believe that the man who proposed beating him up went ahead and did this thing with acid.

'I did not order harm done to this man.'

However, Dmitrichenko and accomplices
evidently also hacked 16,000 emails of top Bolshoi figures as he sought
to prove that Filin demanded a percentage of fees obtained by troupe 
members in TV or sponsored dancing engagements outside the theatre.

It is unclear exactly when Dmitrichenko's trial will begin as police continue to investigate.

Earlier this month the principal ballet dancer with the Bolshoi Theatre claimed he was being forced out of the troupe over allegations that he was part of the acid attack

Nikolai Tsiskaridze, 39, has been told he must leave at the end of the month amidst claims by Bolshoi director Anatoly Iksanov that he may have been involved.

Mr Tsiskaridze's relationship with Mr Iksanov soured sharply after the Bolshoi director suggested that the Georgia-born dancer might have played a role inciting the attack.

Mr Tsiskaridze, who has been at the Bolshoi since 1992 as principal dancer and teacher, hit back saying the manager was conducting a witch hunt against him.

'This is hounding of the sole and most famous artist of the Bolshoi Theatre,' the dancer said.

The principal dancer has now been told that his contract will not be renewed when it expires at the end of June, Bolshoi spokeswoman Katerina Novikova said, but refused to give the reason for the decision.
