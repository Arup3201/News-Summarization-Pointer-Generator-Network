England's hopes of winning the Grand Slam is over after being comfortably beaten by Ireland in Dublin - who themselves moved to the top of the Six Nations standings and put themselves in pole position.

Robbie Henshaw scored the only try of the game and Jonny Sexton kicked four penalties and a conversion as the Irish dominated Stuart Lancaster's side for most of the game.

But the star was scrum half Conor Murray who terrorised his opponents with his clever kicking and quick thinking passing.

IRELAND

Rob Kearney – 6.5 

Made a couple of important tackles when England threatened out wide, but not a major presence in attack.

Tommy Bowe – 6

Ireland didn’t play expansively so he was quite peripheral. One glaring fumble but largely tidy in defence

Jared Payne – 6

Another who didn’t have much of an opportunity to run with the ball but he tackled and competed at rucks with gusto.

Robbie Henshaw – 8

He had already shown great courage and commitment over the ball, before his brilliant try settled the match.

Simon Zebo – 7

Soon set his stall out with swerving runs. Superb in the air; with one brilliant leaping catch above several opponents.

Jonathan Sexton – 7.5

Eventually withdrew injured but pulled the strings with typical authority and quick off the line in defence.

Conor Murray – 9

Enhanced reputation as one of the world’s best scrum halves. His kicking tormented England and one fine break early in the second half.

Murray's kicking and passing game troubled the English throughout as he showed why he's rated so highly

Jack McGrath – 6.5

He was asked to once again fill Cian Healy’s berth at loosehead prop and he did not disappoint as a physical deputy.

Rory Best – 9

The Ulster hooker is a stalwart of this team and was superb. Efficient at lineout, nearly scored early on and a ruck colossus.

Mike Ross – 7 

England would have hoped to gain an advantage in the scrum, but the Leinster tighthead ensured that didn’t happen.

Devin Toner – 6.5 

One crucial lineout steal in the first half. Eclipsed by his second-row partner around the field but a solid effort.

Paul O’Connell – 8

Another giant display by the veteran Lion. He kept carrying hard throughout and was a towering figurehead.

Jonny Sexton kicked four penalties and a conversion to help the Irish seal their place at the top of table

Peter O’Mahony – 7

The Munster flanker offered his side the abrasive, unglamourous work they needed to gain the edge up front.

Jordi Murphy – 7

Impressive over the ball despite conceding early penalty. Not a prominent ball-carrier, but played his part in momentous win.

Sean O’Brien – 6

Went off before the half-hour and seemed to be concussed after a strong drive out of defence. Good early impact.

Replacements 

S Cronin 6, C Healy 6, M Moore 6.5, I Henderson 6, T O’Donnell 6.5, I Madigan 5, F Jones 6. 

 

ENGLAND

Alex Goode – 7

Composed under high ball, showed intent to run from deep, good escape from behind own line but beaten to kick for Henshaw try.

Anthony Watson – 5

Missed early high kicks and struggled in the air. Made one blistering run from deep but spoiled it with wild off-load.

Jonathan Joseph – 6

After two glorious performances, this wasn't his day. No chances to cut loose but he kept looking for work.

Luther Burrell – 6.5

Prevented Best from scoring a try amid early siege and often carried strongly in midfield to give his side momentum.

Jack Nowell – 7

Energetic and committed, couple of good kick-and-chase efforts and late on he threatened the Irish defence, to no avail.

George Ford – 6

Conceded turnover in the first minute and blew hot and cold from then on. Some nice touches but some lapses too.

Ben Youngs – 6

Looked bright and dangerous for a spell during the first half but couldn’t match Murray’s impact with testing box-kicks.

Joe Marler – 6.5

Heavily involved. Forceful hits, a few effective carries and strong over the ball, to continue his fine Test form.

Dylan Hartley – 6

His lineout throwing went awry a couple of times in the first half but he was full of intensity around the field.

Dan Cole – 6

One barnstorming charge late on, but by and large the Leicester prop was occupied with desperate fire-fighting up front.

Dave Attwood – 7

Prominent with early carries, aggressive in defence and showed staggering work-rate, especially during the first half.

George Kruis – 5.5

Kept trying in vain to pressurise the Irish kickers. Not among the leading carriers and quieter than in previous games.

James Haskell – 6

Strong defensive presence early on and he made the Irish fight for every yard, but a limited breakdown presence.

Dave Attwood (centre) also gave a solid performance and showed terrific tenacity and fight 

Billy Vunipola – 6.5

As with earlier matches, he grew into it as time went on, after a slow start. Was at full throttle in the final quarter.

Chris Robshaw – 6

Not his best game. Conceded penalty in first minute, a fumble later and couldn’t impose order amid hasty chaos.

Replacements

T Youngs 6.5, M Vunipola 7, N Easter 6.5, T Croft 6, R Wigglesworth 7, B Twelvetrees 6.
