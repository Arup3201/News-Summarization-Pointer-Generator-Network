This is the shocking moment South African police handcuffed a taxi driver to the back of their van and dragged him away to his death – over an alleged parking offence.

The mobile phone footage shows officers in blue uniforms chaining  27-year-old Mido Macia to the back  of their vehicle, then brazenly speeding off in front of a crowd  of onlookers.

Two hours later, the immigrant from Mozambique was found dead in a police cell.

Footage posted by a South African newspaper shows Mido Macia, dressed in a red jumper, black trousers and white trainers, being surrounded by police officers in a scuffle

A crowd gathered as at least four officers were seen to be manhandling Mr Macia

The incident heaps yet more shame on a
 force that opened fire on striking workers at the Marikana platinum 
mine in August last year, killing 34 people. 

It also comes as the Oscar Pistorius murder trial puts the country’s criminal justice system in the spotlight.

Mr Macia was arrested in the Daveyton 
township outside Johannesburg on Tuesday evening. An anonymous witness 
told a local newspaper: ‘[Police] argued with Macia and then they beat 
him up.

‘They handcuffed him to the back of the van and slammed the door in his face.

‘With blood running down his face they
 drove off. He was in pain. He cried and asked the cops to stop but they
 continued anyway.’

One onlooker told the South African Daily Sun that Mr Macia was heard begging police to stop the assault

Mr Macia was held with his hands handcuffed above his head before the driver of the police van pulled away

South Africa’s Independent Police 
Investigative Directorate, which has launched an investigation, said the
 probable cause of death was head injuries with internal bleeding.

Spokesman Moses Dlamini said 
investigators had been told Mr Macia was asked to move his minibus taxi 
by two policemen because it was blocking the road.

Mr Macia then allegedly assaulted one 
of the officers and took his gun, before officers managed to put the 
‘resisting suspect’ into the van to go to the cells.

A prisoner who was in the police station said: ‘They killed him. They beat him up so badly in here.’

Despite his plea for police to stop attacking him, officers carried on beating Mr Macia

The incident has prompted a  furious 
backlash in South Africa. Frans Cronje from the South African Institute 
of Race Relations think-tank said: ‘It is a level of  barbarity on a par
 with police behaviour at Marikana.

‘We strongly support the police use of force to meet the criminal onslaught.

‘But this is an ill-disciplined and 
brutal rabble that have lost all respect for themselves, their jobs, the
 societies they work in.’

Officers dropped Mr Macia's legs once more and he was dragged along the ground
