Rio Ferdinand's departure from Old Trafford came at the right time, according to new Manchester United manager Louis van Gaal.

Ferdinand, who left United after 12 years this summer, returns for the first time as a QPR player on Sunday. 

It is understood that the veteran defender was keen to stay on but was informed by United chief Ed Woodward in the away dressing-room at Southampton on the final day of last season that he would not be getting a contract extension.

Rio Ferdinand enjoyed several successful years at Manchester United but left in the summer

But Louis van Gaal said it was the right time for the 'great player' to leave the club

United’s problems at the back after Van Gaal implemented a three-man defence has led to suggestions that Ferdinand would still be a valuable asset.

But the Dutchman said: ‘No, there is a time to stay and time to go and I think he decided to go. He was a great player and maybe he is still a great player, but there is always a time to go for a player in a club.’
