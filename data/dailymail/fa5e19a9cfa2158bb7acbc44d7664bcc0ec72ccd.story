Hellas Verona has been ordered to play its next home match in Serie A with one end of its stadium closed because of fan racism.

The Italian league also fined Verona £39,400  for racist chants directed at AC Milan and Ghana midfielder Sulley Muntari, plus £2,400 for fan insults toward the referee.

Milan won Sunday's match 3-1 - with Japan playmaker Keisuke Honda scoring twice.

Verona's next home match is against Lazio on October 30.

Also, the league fined Inter Milan £24,000  for derogatory territorial chants directed by fans at Napoli supporters during a 2-2 draw.

Meanwhile, Roma fans have been barred from attending a match at Napoli on November 1 following clashes that led to one fan's death from a shooting before the Italian Cup final in May.
