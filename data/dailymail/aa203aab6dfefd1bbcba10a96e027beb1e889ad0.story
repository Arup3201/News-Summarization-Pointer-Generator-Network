Yet another award fell at Cristiano Ronaldo’s twinkling feet on Sunday night, when he was named BBC Overseas Personality of the Year.

On an evening in Glasgow populated by the royalty of Scottish sport - mostly handing out the prizes, though in the case of Sir Chris Hoy awarded one himself - as well as British prince, the glitziest sports star on display was the Portuguese striker with the slicked-back hair.

Ronaldo joined us on the video from Morocco, where Real Madrid are training for the World Club Cup.

Goals: 61

Trophies: Champions League, Copa del Rey 

Team-mate Gareth Bale presented the award to his fellow and greatest Galactico, who this year scored his 200th goal in 178 games.

His 23 hat-tricks are a La Liga record.

The highlight of his and the team’s season was Real’s 10th European Cup triumph, with the help of his 17 goals.

Ronaldo told the BBC upon receiving the award from team-mate Bale: 'Thank you to the BBC for choosing me.

'It is a great honour to receive this award.

Thank you to all my old fans in England, it is an honour.

'Good night!' 

And only this weekend he presented all his team-mates with watches, each worth £6,000, engraved with La Decima in honour of their unparalleled achievement.

There were the inevitable delays on the line as the show crossed to Morocco to chat to Ronaldo, a nostalgic echo of the days when Des Lynam spoke to the likes of Frank Bruno across the Atlantic. You know what I mean?
