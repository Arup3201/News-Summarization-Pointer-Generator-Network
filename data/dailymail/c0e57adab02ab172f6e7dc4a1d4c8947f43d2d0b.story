Keeping pace: At one point Munchkin veers to the back of the running board as she struggles to keep up, but then she determinedly pulls back through

She is seen wagging her tongue and inquisitively looking around as she jogs away.

Munchkin took to the spotlight this Halloween when she debuted her rather unscary bear costume.

Roth crafted the fluffy ensemble for her tiny 14-inch-tall puppy out of a plush toy.

She then posted photographs and a video of Munchkin online, with many fans likening the animal to an 'adorable' version of the Star Wars Ewoks. 

An 11-second film shows Munchkin bounding up to the camera completely unaware of how funny she looks. 

Internet fame: Munchkin's novel antics have secured her a burgeoning fan base and her YouTube channel boasts more than three million hits

Chilling out: Munchkin seen out of her bear costume with a feline companion 

To make the costume, Roth measured Munchkin and selected an appropriately sized toy.

She also picked a teddy with matching sandy-colored fur. She then cut the face, feet and back out of the soft bear and removed all of the stuffing except for the arms.

To finish, Roth inserted Munchkin's front arms into the teddy's legs.  

Munchkin appears to have a penchant for dressing up and another photo shows her modeling a party hat, complete with pink feather trim. 

Her novel antics have secured her a burgeoning fan base and her YouTube channel boasts more than three million hits.
