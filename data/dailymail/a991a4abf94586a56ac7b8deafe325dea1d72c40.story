Police chiefs have handed Leeds United more than £1.2 million after the High Court ruled that the Championship football club had been overcharged for policing at home games, a judge has heard.

But Leeds' bosses claim that they are still owed more than £800,000, Sir David Eady was told.

The figures emerged on Friday after the judge examined the latest stage of the dispute between West Yorkshire Police and Leeds.

Overharged: West Yorkshire Police have been ordered to pay Leeds £1.2m

Two years ago Eady ruled that the force overcharged for 'special police services' over three seasons between 2009 and 2012, following a High Court hearing.

West Yorkshire Police and Leeds are now arguing over how exactly much should be repaid.

The judge on Friday revealed detail of developments in the case in a written analysis following a further High Court hearing in London in June.

'In July 2012, I ruled that Leeds United Football Club had been charged for special police services over the three preceding football seasons, in respect of home matches, on a basis that was in part unlawful,' Eady said.

'It thus became necessary to find a methodology by which to calculate the appropriate rebate. It did not prove possible for the parties to agree a formula. Each ... proposed a distinct methodology.'

The judge said one area of dispute related to how special police service charges should be made for the 2012-13 seasons and 2013-14 seasons.

'West Yorkshire Police has paid Leeds United Football Club £1,238,816.61 which is said to represent the total loss including interest,' he added. 'Leeds United Football Club, on the other hand, seeks a further £844,016.36 plus interest (to include claims in respect of 2012-13 and 2013-14).'

The judge said the force had 'repaid the rebate it thought due' and 'claims now that no more is owed'.

Eady said a 'particular problem' related to the policing of areas of land near the entrance to Elland Road - where a statue of former Leeds captain Billy Bremner was sited.

The judge said that, because of crowd movement, there was no 'definitive method' of identifying how many officers were needed in each area. He said the only practical solution was to attribute a 'fair and reasonable proportion' to each area.

He said Leeds wanted a 'detailed breakdown' of how many officers were deployed on each match day and at 'what rate of remuneration'. But he said that would go beyond what was reasonable and impose unnecessary burdens upon police bosses.

The original litigation had centred on the policing of land near the ground not owned, leased or controlled by Leeds. Eady had ruled that the services rendered fell within the normal police duty to keep the peace.
