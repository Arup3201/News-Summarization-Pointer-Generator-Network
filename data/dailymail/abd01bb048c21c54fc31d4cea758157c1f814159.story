One of Britain’s most senior police officers broke ranks yesterday to admit that crime figures cannot be trusted.

Mick Creedon said officers at every level are ‘inadvertently’ manipulating statistics because of the huge pressure to cut crime.

The Derbyshire chief said an ‘obsession’ with measuring police performance over more than a decade has left a legacy of unwitting corruption.

He was backed by other senior colleagues who said different forces are ‘inconsistent’ in how they log the trail of misery left by criminals.

They said many crimes from rape to bicycle theft and criminal damage are grossly under-reported, sometimes because victims lack confidence in police.

Meanwhile other fast-emerging threats such as child exploitation and abuse, as well as internet fraud and blackmail are left off official figures.

Speaking at a meeting of police chiefs, Mr Creedon said levels of domestic violence and rape would soar if the ‘utter reality’ of crime was revealed.

‘Inadvertently, I think, we are still putting pressure on officers to do all they can to manipulate and create crime reductions,’ he said.

‘The truth is if we really wanted to get to get the position in crime we would see a massive increase in domestic violence.

‘It is whether we have the nerve to step away from crime reductions and the obsession with crime figures and move to a real environment where we do properly record.

‘It is sadly what is told to me by 
many forces still is that everything people do everything they can to 
make sure crime is not going up.

‘The consequence is another threat to integrity. This is inadvertently caused by what we have done over the past decade.

‘I don’t think they do it because they are inherently corrupt, they are doing it because the pressure is on to reduce crime.’

Mr Creedon’s unusually candid comments highlighted a rift between the Government and the highest ranks of police.

They came amid reports that some forces are experiencing a rise in overall crime for the first time in many years.

The Coalition says it has removed all police targets to remove red tape and enable police to be ‘single-minded crime fighters’.

But
forces are still measured by their performance on key offences and 
chiefs said this creates a relentless pressure to record as few crimes 
as possible.

Earlier this 
week a serving Met officer sparked a furore when he told a Parliamentary
committee that crimes are disappearing in a ‘puff of smoke’.

MPs were told official statistics are routinely massaged by officers desperate to show they are making the streets safer.

At yesterday’s meeting of the Association of Chief Police Officers (Acpo), Police Minister Damian Green was told crime figures simply cannot be relied upon.

Sir Peter Fahy, who heads Greater Manchester Police, said the drive to give frontline officer more discretion has led to different interpretations of how crimes are logged.

He said: ‘We all know, essentially, that recorded crime is unreliable statistically because there are so many variations in it.

‘It is not about ‘fiddling’ figures, when you look at the more minimal type of crime there is a large field of interpretation about whether they are crimes or not.’

But Mr Green reacted angrily, telling chief constables that massaging crime figures crosses a ‘thick red line’ and is ‘straight-forwardly unacceptable’.

He said that politicians don’t try and win elections by ‘fiddling the votes’ and that he is ‘surprised and disappointed’ by the claims.

Asked if crime figures are accurate, Mr Green replied: ‘In most cases they are. We will be looking very carefully at what we have heard.’

The police watchdog, HM Inspectorate of Constabulary, is undertaking a review of how all forces record crime.

It is expected to uncover widespread discrepancies in whether specific incidents should be categorised as a crime, and if so, what offence took place.

Gwent Chief Constable Jeff Farrar, who is the national lead on crime figures, admitted performance targets have created ‘perverse incentives’.

But he said in many cases officers do not record offences in the ‘public interest’, for example over a playground dispute or when a child steals from home.

Other reasons for poor or inaccurate recording could ‘lack of awareness’, work pressure and professional discretion, he added.

Mr Farrar said: ‘Nobody joins the police service with the intention of recording crime inaccurately.’
