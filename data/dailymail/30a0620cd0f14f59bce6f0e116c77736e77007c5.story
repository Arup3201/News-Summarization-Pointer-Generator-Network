The son of a First World War soldier has sold his home so he can publish his late father's harrowing memoirs that have recently been unearthed.

John Burder has turned the hundreds of pages of text written by Captain Claud Burder into a book after finding a large number of documents hidden in a dusty trunk in the attic.

The 72-year-old managed to run off a limited edition of 500 hardback copies of his father's horrifying account of life in the trenches, called 'Hell on Earth', which were mostly given to friends and family.

But he believes the memoirs ought to be read by a wider audience and after he started getting requests from more people, he approached several publishing companies with no success.

Now Mr Burder has sold his detached home in Bournemouth, Dorset, and moved into a bungalow to raise £25,000 to fund the publishing project - including having the book professionally designed.

Using the self-publishing house New Generation, he will be printing on demand but is hoping to produce 10,000 copies and wants to supply as many as possible to schools and colleges.

'Hell on Earth' details the grim and bloody experiences Capt Burder endured in the trenches, including seeing a comrade 'blown to pieces' while stood next to him and diving for cover from a shell only to land on the dead body of a comrade.

On another occasion he placed himself between two 'sleeping' soldiers in a darkened shelter under bombardment. It was only when dawn broke he realised they had both been killed.

It also records the moment his life was saved by his fountain pen which deflected a piece of shrapnel aimed for his heart.

Despite completing hundreds of pages, Capt Burder locked the manuscript in a chest and never spoke about the war before his death in 1968 aged 87.

His son inherited his family's belongings but didn't get round to opening the trunk until 2009.

He was stunned when he learned of what his father had gone through at the notorious battlegrounds of Ypres and the Somme.

Mr Burder, a retired TV producer, said: 'It is the most amazing and horrific account of what the war was like. My father described everything like it was yesterday.

'The book is not the work of a journalist or a historian or a general getting reports from people at the front. It is a verbatim, contemporary account written by a man who was there throughout the entire war. A man who suffered with his men and went through it all and somehow survived it.

'It should be read by any young person who has even the slightest interest in the war because it does show how stupid and futile it was.

'I thought it my duty to try and get my father's story in front of as many people as possible.

'The first run of 500 hardbacks cost me £3,000. I sold them for £16 each and I had a job to break even.

'I decided to sell my home and move to a bungalow so I could afford to print more copies.

'I have spent about £25,000 on the project so far but the object isn't to make money, just to get dad's word out to people who want to listen.

'I am just doing what he can't do himself, it would be totally wrong of me if I didn't.'

Capt Burder, an English graduate from Cambridge University, was a vicar before the war broke out in 1914. He tried to join the army as a reverend but, at 32, was told he was too old so enlisted with the Middlesex Regiment as a private.

In the following four years he rose to the rank of captain and was awarded the Military Medal for leading his men with great gallantry and courage.

His war ended in 1918 when he was struck in the head by a piece of shell. A young officer who had been standing next to him was 'blown to pieces' in the explosion. 

He wrote: 'Nothing whatsoever was left of him, not a single button.'

An account of his at the Somme two years earlier reads: 'We passed many dead men, one of whom I remember because he was kneeling on one knee with his rifle still in his two hands as if he had been killed in the act of advancing.'

He described Ypres as 'this devastated hell' and of when the Germans shelled their shelter in the trenches.

He wrote: 'It was so dark that it was impossible even to see who was next to me but I could feel there was someone on my left, I thought he was asleep. 

'As the darkness dwindled...I could see now my campanian and understand his silence. His head had been blown off without otherwise disturbing his position.

'On my right a man who was sitting in the same position as my silent companion on the left had his head removed in exactly the same way.'

There were one or two light-hearted moments during the conflict.

An impromptu game of cricket with a stick and a tennis ball resulted in him smashing the ball through the window of his commanding officer's lodging, prompting him to jump up in panic.

And when his company entered the village of Vimy in April 1917 following a ferocious battle a comrade was astonished to hear one of the German prisoners calling out his name. It transpired that before the war the PoW had been a baker in Twickenham.

After the war Capt Burder returned to the church and became rector of St Mary's Church in Huntingdon, Cambridgeshire, and then chaplain at nearby RAF Wyton.

He married wife Gabrielle in 1921 and they had three children; George, Mary and John.

Tragically, Mary died aged six from whooping cough and George, a lieutenant in the Rifle Brigade, was killed crossing the Rhine towards the end of World War Two.

He was posthumously awarded the Military Cross, which his father received from King George VI.
