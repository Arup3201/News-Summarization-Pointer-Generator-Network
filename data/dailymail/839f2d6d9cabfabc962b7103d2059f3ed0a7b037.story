Caused offence: Stan Collymore described the archipelago as a 'f***ing island with sheep'

Football pundit Stan Collymore was today criticised by a Royal Navy veteran after he claimed Britain had ‘thieved’ the Falklands.

The 43-year-old former Liverpool player, who now works as a Talksport radio commentator, described the archipelago to his 565,000 Twitter followers as a ‘f***ing island with sheep’.

He said: ‘Falklands? Wasn't anyone's. We just thieved it, as we do. What glory, what triumph. A f***ing island with sheep. Rule Britannia.’

The tweet - which was posted on Saturday night - has since been deleted, but there have been calls for Collymore to issue a public apology.

Chris 'Kenny' Swain, 50, who served as Petty Officer Gunner in the Royal Navy from 1980 to 2003, said Collymore should be sacked from Talksport.

Mr Swain, of Plymouth, Devon said: ‘I had a lot of friends that died in the Falklands. I think it's just an absolute outrage. I don't know whether he did it to raise his profile, but it's just an outrage.

‘There are so many upset people. He needs to be sacked from Talksport for a start - you can't have somebody with opinions like that addressing the public. I am just so angry.

‘Everybody fought for what they believed in, whether as a young man or an officer it doesn't matter. You are following orders and you believe in what you're doing.’

And a post of the official Twitter feed of the Falkland Islands Government said: 'Very disappointed to hear Mr Collymore's views on the Falklands - factually incorrect and hurtful.'

Argentina claims it inherited the islands from Spain in the 1800s. But the UK says it has 
carried out long-term administration of the Falklands and almost all of 
the islanders are of British descent.

In response to a request from Falklands Radio on Twitter for Collymore to explain his comments in an interview, he replied: 'The tweets are unambiguous enough for you to use common sense.'

Collymore, who said he had voted Labour 
in every election since his first in 1990, also published an image of a 
tweet he posted in 2012 that encouraged people to wear a poppy on Remembrance Day.

Argentina invaded the Falkland Islands, a remote UK colony, in April 1982. It engaged British and Argentinian forces in the biggest naval conflict since the Second World War.

Argentinian junta leader General Leopoldo Galtieri wanted to reclaim sovereignty of the islands, and sent 600 troops to take them.

But the UK fought back, with Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher saying the 1,800 residents there were ‘of British tradition and stock’.

The battle ended 74 days after the initial invasion, on June 14. Some 655 Argentine and 255 British servicemen lost their lives in the conflict, as well as three Falkland Islanders.

In a referendum in March 2013, which saw a 92 per cent turnout, 1,513 islanders vote to retain their status as British overseas territory, with just three voting against.

In addition, he retweeted supportive messages from current and former servicemen, describing this as 'sanity at last'.

The pundit - a prolific Tweeter who has posted more than 37,000 messages - briefly quit Twitter in January after complaining about receiving abusive tweets.

He reported a barrage of death threats and racist taunts to Staffordshire Police, but he said the social networking website did not go far enough to help police identify the culprits.

The ex-striker said officers were ‘banging their heads against the wall’ because Twitter was dragging its feet over revealing the trolls’ identities.

The former Aston Villa and Nottingham Forest player said he had no problem with ‘honestly held opinion’.

But he pointed out that people would be arrested immediately if they used the same threats and racist language in public that he faced on Twitter.

Collymore, who also complained to police about abusive tweets last December, said officers had been ‘brilliant’, but said it was wrong that they had to go through a laborious process to identify abusive users.
