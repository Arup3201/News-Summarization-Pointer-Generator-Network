Figurehead: High Grant is Hacked Off's most high-profile campaigner

A cynical ploy to use rebel Tory MPs to force through punitive new press laws was exposed last night.

An explosive leaked document reveals how campaigners from the Hacked Off group are secretly targeting Tory MPs ‘who want to bring David Cameron down’ in the hope they will sabotage Mr Cameron’s plan to block state regulation of the media.

It makes it clear Hacked Off despises the Conservative MPs they are wooing, but are under orders to suppress their loathing and exploit divisions within Tory ranks to muzzle the press.

The leaked memo says that supporters must swallow their natural ‘distrust and dislike’ of Right-wing Tory MPs and take advantage of their determination to ‘evict’ Cameron from No 10.

The document also reveals how Hacked Off ruthlessly capitalised on what it calls ‘the Dowler test’, a reference to murdered schoolgirl Millie Dowler, whose phone was hacked.

It says: ‘The expression “the Dowler test” has pushed its way into the popular lexicon, when in fact it doesn’t exist. Not yet that is. We need to define what the Dowler test is and make it binary.’

The claim that News of the World journalists had deleted messages on Millie Dowler’s mobile phone, giving her parents false hope that she was alive, provoked a national outcry and led to the closure of the paper.

It later emerged that the claim was wrong and that the newspaper did not delete the messages.

The leak is the first full account of the inner workings and methods of Hacked Off, set up after the Millie Dowler phone furore.

Launched by the Media Standards Trust, and with actor Hugh Grant as its highly effective frontman, it has demanded full transparency of connections between the press and politicians.

But it refuses to give details of its own funding or contacts with MPs.

The Mail on Sunday can also disclose that the Hacked Off strategy is receiving secret help from a Labour-leaning lobby company in which a former spin doctor to Peter Mandelson and John Prescott is involved.

The document, leaked on the eve of tomorrow’s crucial Commons vote on media ethics, discloses how Hacked Off planned to draw up a list of ‘30-40 hand-picked dissenters’ including those with grudges against Cameron, whether political or personal.

Senior Tory MP David Davis said last night: ‘For an organisation that represents itself as standing for honesty, transparency and high ethical standards, this shows astonishing hypocrisy and cynicism.

‘It is precisely the manipulative tendency we were led to believe that they deplore.’

The document has been leaked to this newspaper by a Hacked Off whistleblower appalled by the group’s manoeuvrings.

Speaking on condition of remaining anonymous, the whistleblower said: ‘I am shocked by their underhand approach.

‘It is time the public knows what they are really like. I feel very uncomfortable about the approach of their campaign.’

The leaked ‘strategy document’ was discussed at a Hacked Off meeting attended by the group’s founder, Brian Cathcart, and its directors, Grant and lawyer Charlotte Harris, who has represented phone hacking victims.

The meeting took place at the London offices of Ms Harris’s law firm, Mishcon de Reya, on September 19. Ms Harris has represented several phone-hacking victims.

Labour leader Ed Miliband and Lib Dem Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg will join forces in the Commons tomorrow to try to force through state regulation of the press in the wake of Lord Justice Leveson’s report into media ethics, set up after the News International phone-hacking scandal.

The outcome could hinge on how many Conservative MPs defy Mr Cameron and back the Lib-Lab alliance.

The leaked memo says it has only ‘one aim – an independent statutory regulator with punitive powers’.

It says: ‘Within the Government there is a cabal of discontents, Right- wing outliers and mavericks unwilling to toe the party line, happy to ignore the Whip and keen to evict the tenants of Downing Street.’

The memo identifies rebel Tory MPs with every kind of grudge against Cameron, and explains how Hacked Off can recruit them as allies.

The document, written by Ella Mason, Hacked Off’s head of campaigns who was a Tory aide in the 2010 Election, was approved at the September meeting.

This newspaper has also established that Hacked Off has also been advised by BBM, a lobbyist firm set up by two of Tony Blair’s former campaign chiefs. 

BBM boss Alan Barnard is helping Hacked Off and BBM director Gez Sagar was present when the Hacked Off plan to target Tory MPs was discussed.

The BBM website says media director Mr Sagar was press secretary to Lord Prescott and ‘campaign writer’ for Mr Blair.

It omits to say he was also spin doctor for ex Labour Minister Lord Mandelson during the Millennium Dome fiasco.

There is no reference on the websites of Hacked Off or BBM to their connections with each other.

The Hacked Off insider said: ‘BBM is kept in the background. People say, “It’s best if Hacked Off stuff is not seen to be coming from them.” ’

In a statement, Hacked Off said last night: ‘Hacked Off was looking to recruit MPs of all political persuasions from an early date.

'It was never our approach to target one group or another: we thought that all sides would see that victims of press abuse had a right to be heard.

'Hacked Off do not employ BBM but we have worked alongside them.’

The spokesman confirmed that Mr Sagar had advised them on an unpaid basis.
