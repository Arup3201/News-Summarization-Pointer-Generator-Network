Nine people who illegally named a woman raped by a footballer were told to pay her just £624 each in compensation yesterday.

The nine, who included a woman teacher, posted messages on Twitter and Facebook accusing the 19 year old of being a ‘money-grabbing slut’ who had made up the attack.

Some are on benefits and will be able to pay the debt off at £6 a week – denying the teenager full compensation for two years.

Last night the former Tory MP who reported the internet bullies to police said the judge’s lenient sentence ‘sickened her’.

‘A teenage rape victim was insulted, 
demeaned and named – and the perpetrators get fined just a few hundred 
quid. The law must change to protect victims,’ said Louise Mensch.

Sandra McNeill from Rape Crisis Leeds 
said: ‘The fine is outrageous. The law, which protects the anonymity of 
rape victims, needs to be adequately applied.

‘If somebody breaks the law they 
should go to jail – and not be given paltry fines. Someone senior needs 
to have a word with that judge.’

Arrested: Dominic Green, 23, was one of the nine held and later convicted over the naming of the victim

The teenager is said to have been 
traumatised by the heated online discussion after Ched Evans was 
convicted in April of raping her the previous May.

The nine posted the messages about her
 with ‘deliberate malice’ after the 23-year-old Wales and Sheffield 
United striker was jailed for five years for the hotel room assault.

The defendants appeared at Prestatyn 
Magistrates' Court in North Wales charged with publishing material likely
 to lead members of the public to identify the complainant in a rape 
case.

They claimed not to know that identifying a rape victim was a criminal offence.

Policing the internet is proving a 
challenge for constabularies and the case involving such a large group 
is believed to be unprecedented.

The offence – in a case which went to 
the Attorney General for consent before charges were laid – carried a 
maximum fine of £5,000.

District judge Andrew Shaw rejected other sentencing options in favour of ordering the payment of compensation.

Technically, this means the nine – 
including a biology teacher, a cousin of the player and football 
supporters – were not even fined.

‘Rape is a taboo in every civilised 
society,’ said the judge. ‘It is viewed in this way because it is a 
crime against women which subjects them to the most intimate personal 
violation.

‘For reasons which I had thought were 
within the common knowledge of most intelligent people in this country 
we offer further protection for the victims of rape by prohibiting the 
publication of their names and personal details.’

But Christopher Hutchins, a lawyer, said: ‘No fine can put back into the box the fact that the victim has been identified.’

Guilty: Benjamin Davies, 27, left, and Craig MacDonald, 26, right, were among the group who passed round comments such as 'money grabbing whore' about the victim

Shamed: Shaun Littler, 22, covers his face outside court, left, while Holly Price, 25, right, faced obscured by umbrella, is also publicity shy

He said the case sent a ‘public health
 warning’ to all those who use social media and treat it ‘as a 
conversation’ when it has a ‘far greater ability to spread virally and 
cause serious harm’.

Last night campaigner Jill Saward, who
 was the victim of the Ealing Vicarage rape in 1986, said the punishment
 should have been stiffer.

Convicted: Footballer Ched Evans was found guilty of rape in April and today nine people admitted revealing the name of the victim online

‘I don’t think it’s enough,’ she said.
 ‘It’s very difficult for victims to come forward when you are dealing 
with celebrity cases.

‘Questions are raised about your 
integrity and people will slag you off because you have made a claim 
against someone who is famous.

‘Sentences need to be a lot stiffer than they currently are. It is not much of a deterrent.’

The judge told the offenders they had identified the victim, some with abusive comments and others with ‘deliberate malice’.

He added: ‘You did so without proper knowledge of the facts and without any heed of the feelings of the victim.

‘Your actions have revictimised this 
woman again. It is not for you to take the law into your own hands as 
you did. In my view you best atone for what you have done by paying 
compensation.’

He ordered them to pay a total of £5,616 in compensation as their only punishment.

Nita Dowell, prosecuting, told the 
court the case attracted a huge amount of interest nationally and 
internationally and there were 6,000 mentions on Twitter.

She said North Wales Police received 
numerous complaints from members of the public and from groups such as 
Rape Crisis about the victim’s treatment online.

Holly Price, 26, a college biology teacher from Prestatyn, retweeted a comment calling the victim a ‘money-grabbing slut’.

Price later told police that she had been an idiot and wanted to apologise to the victim.

Admission: The nine said they didn't realise what they had done was a crime, Prestatyn Magistrates' Court heard

Star: Evans was an established striker with Sheffield United (pictured scoring against Swansea City) - and some of the people involved in naming the rape victim were Blades fans

Gemma Thomas, 18, a pub worker and 
cousin of Evans from Rhyl, described the victim as a ‘money-grabbing 
little tramp’ and ‘dirty slapper’.

The maximum penalty for revealing the identity of a rape victim is just a fine.

But other social media users who have broken different laws online have gone to jail.

After
 the footballer Fabrice Muamba collapsed on the pitch from a heart 
attack during a Bolton Wanderers match, student Liam Stacey, 21, was 
sent to prison for inciting racial hatred over abusive texts.

He was sentenced to 56 days in prison.

Dominic Green, 23, also from the 
player’s home town, named the victim on Facebook in what he accepted was
 ‘an act of utter stupidity’. Jobless Paul Devine, from Sheffield, wrote
 on Facebook: ‘She’s to blame for her downfall. Let’s find her address.’

His lawyer said the 26 year old had no intention of doing so and deleted the post four hours later.

Jobless Benjamin Davies,  a 27 year old from Rhyl who was a friend of the footballer, made an abusive comment on Twitter.

Michael Ashton, 21, of Llanddulas, Colwyn Bay, tweeted she had ‘cried rape’ and she ‘made him sick’.

He removed the post after his law student girlfriend told him it was illegal.

Shaun Littler, a 22-year-old hotel 
receptionist and football fan from Sheffield, suggested on Twitter the 
victim had ‘cried rape before’. He later told police he was ‘devastated’
 that Sheffield United had lost Evans as a result of the trial because 
he was the team’s best player.

Another fan Daniel Cardwell, 25 and from Sheffield, told police he was drunk when he insulted the victim on Twitter.

And jobless Craig MacDonald, 26, from Prestatyn, tweeted the woman was a ‘money-grabbing slut’.

@highlight

As well as naming Ched Evans's rape victim, they also posted vile abuse - calling her a 'money grabbing whore' and a 'poor little victim'

@highlight

Under British law no victim of rape or sexual assaults can be named but the maximum penalty is just a fine

@highlight

Some of the nine did not name her themselves, but 'retweeted' her identity, which was still enough to be convicted
