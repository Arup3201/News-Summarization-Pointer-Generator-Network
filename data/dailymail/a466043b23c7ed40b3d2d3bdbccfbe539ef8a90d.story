A family of three was tragically killed Christmas morning when a drunk driver rammed into their car going the wrong way on a Seminole, Florida road. 

Driver Paul Edward Pulkownik was arrested after testing a .319 for blood-alcohol content an hour and a half after the crash - four times the legal limit under Florida law.

The crash happened early Christmas morning around 12:30am when the Martins family of nearby Largo was returning home from a Christmas Eve celebration.

Arrested: Driver Paul Edward Pulkownik, 51 (pictured), faces charges including DUI manslaughter, DUI property damage and vehicular homicide 

Pulkownik had just left a friends house where he allegedly consumed two or three beers., according to Florida Highway Patrol.  

He was driving his Ford Explorer the wrong way on Park Boulevard when he rammed into the Martins' car - killing 84-year-old Joao Martins, his 82-year-old wife Arminda, and their 58-year-old daughter-in-law Isabel. 

Isabel died at the scene while her in-laws died later after being transported to Bayfront Medical Center. 

Before being taken to the hospital himself, Pulkownik was asked by authorities to show his drivers license and that's when they first noticed he was intoxicated. 

According to a search warrant, Pulkownik fumbled through his wallet trying to find his ID and mistakenly handed officers his credit card first. 

They said Pulkownik slurred his speech, smelled of alcohol and that they found  one empty and one full can of Natural Ice beer in his vehicle.

Pulkownik was treated for minor injuries in the collision and arrested four days later on December 29 with three charges each of DUI-manslaughter and vehicular homicide. He was also charged with one count of misdemeanor DUI-property damage and a handed a citation for driving on the wrong side of the road.
