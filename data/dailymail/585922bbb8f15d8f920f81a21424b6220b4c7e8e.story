Social media users now have the opportunity to name seven of the newest Queensland Police recruits- a litter of puppies destined for official duties.

Queensland Police Minister Jo-Ann Miller announced the name search after the birth of the fluffy recruits, with the condition that the name must start with a 'W'. 

Minister Miller said that the voting system was a way to involve the state's community and highlight the important work that police dogs play in the prevention of crime.

'The Dog Squad is one of the most active and essential frontline services of the Queensland Police Service,' Minister Miller said.

'Giving Queenslanders the opportunity to name seven of our newest crime-fighting canines also gives us a chance to shine a light on the vital role police dogs and their handlers play in keeping Queenslanders safe,' she said.

'Each litter of new puppies is given a letter to distinguish them from the others. These five girls and two boys are the W litter, so their names need to start with W. We want Queenslanders to get creative and put forward their best suggestions.' 

After only a day, the Police blog had been flooded with more than 10,000 votes, and many Queenslanders took to Twitter to highlight their favourite name.

Some of the name suggestions for the seven-week-old pups  included Wendy, Wallace, Wayne,  Wanda, Wilamena, Winifred, and even Witchypoo.

'Submitted a puppy name suggestion... "Walter White",' tweeted one voter

Voters took the call to be creative with their votes seriously, with some suggesting names from movies or television shows. 

'Submitted a puppy name suggestion... "Walter White",' tweeted one voter, while another voted for 'Winter is Coming'.

'You've got a friend in me? Woody was the 10,000th entry for #nameourpuppies- keep them coming,' said a tweet from the official Queensland Police Media twitter account. 

On Saturday, the Queensland Police Media twitter account said that the authority's 'muso fans [were] putting in some great suggestions'. 

The opportunity to submit names will be active until March 25, and voting on a shortlist of the suggested names will be announced on April 2. 

The seven puppies will undergo training over the next few months and could join the 89 dogs currently working

The seven puppies will undergo training over the next few months, and could join the 89 dogs currently working with the police force, which include those working with  drug detection, firearm detection, a specialist cadaver dog and 69 'general purpose' dogs.

'Forget your typical puppy pre-school, these little ones are destined to become general purpose or drug detection dogs – so they need special training,' Minister Miller said.

'Each year our general purpose dogs are responsible for the tracking and apprehension of hundreds of offenders state-wide,' she said.

'Detection dogs are also responsible for keeping significant quantities of illicit drugs off Queensland streets.'
