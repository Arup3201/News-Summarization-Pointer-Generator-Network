A long-time Boston Marathon volunteer inadvertently snapped dozens of pictures of the two ethnic Chechen brothers near the finish line of last Monday’s ill-fated race, getting clear shots of the two men who are accused of bringing death and chaos to what would have been a day of triumph and celebration.

Electrical engineer Bob Leonard, 58, captured 10 to 20 photos a minute with his Nikon camera near the finish line as they finished their grueling 26.2-mile run. After the FBI released images of the two suspects, 26-year-old Tamerlan Tsarnaev, and 19-year-old Dzhokhar Tsarnaev, Leonard realized he had clear shots of the two men, seen wearing baseball caps.

The images are startling in part because they show the Tsarnaev brothers looking calm, relaxed, and even smug, minutes before the two bombs they allegedly planted exploded, injuring more than 180 and killing three.

Leonard's photographs were taken approximately 10-20 minutes before the blast, according to the time stamps

In the photographs, the brothers, who are U.S. citizens but ethnic Chechans, look relaxed ahead of the two explosions; a black back is also seen below the woman in the green coat

Leonard uploaded the photos with the Tsarnaev brothers to the FBI’s website on Thursday, and by Friday morning, saw his images splashed over the morning news, allowing an important breakthrough in the manhunt. 

'That finally gave them a good facial picture,' Leonard told the Associated Press. 'It was a pretty good breakthrough.'

The two men were later identified as brothers, 26-year-old Tamerlan Tsarnaev, who was killed in shootout with police overnight Friday, and 19-year-old Dzhokhar Tsarnaev, distinctive in his backward white baseball cap and dark curly hair poking out from under it.

The younger man was captured Friday night after a daylong siege of a Boston suburb, seriously injured following Thursday night’s shootout.  

Also on Friday, President Barack Obama condemned Monday’s attack as an act of terrorism, saying it was the worst of its kind to occur on American soil since 9/11. 

After combing the digital images, he was sure he had something the FBI could use. He tried to upload them to an FBI site that it had asked the public to use.

On Thursday evening, the FBI showed pictures of the brothers, identifying them as Suspect Number 1 and Suspect Number 2

The brothers are seen looking on as runners near the finish line, with Tamerlan with his hands shoved in his pockets

Then he called the hotline number and
was on hold for about 40 minutes, the response was so overwhelming. He 
finally got an FBI spokesman, who told him to upload them to another 
site. Within 20 minutes, someone from the Department of Homeland 
Security called him back.

'They
were on the news ... clear pictures of the two subjects and those were 
the pictures that I sent in,' said Leonard, who started photography as a
hobby when his sons played high school sports.He was not the only picture-taker to help with images of the suspects.

Seconds
after the bombs exploded, David Green pulled out his smartphone and 
took a photo of the chaos developing a couple hundred yards in front of 
him - the smoke, the people running in panic.

The brothers slowly moved their way closer to the finish line in these sequence of photos

Looking east on Boylston Street, toward the finish line of the Boston Marathon, the first bomb detonated near the finish line, and the second happened in front of a Lord & Taylor store

The
Jacksonville businessman then put his phone back in his pocket and went
to help the injured. It wasn't until Thursday, when officials released 
surveillance video of the two suspects, that Green realized what he had -
a picture of Dzhokhar Tsarnaev walking away from the scene.

Leonard, from Taunton, Massachusetts, said that the two suspects stood in a specific corner for ‘quite a bit of time.’

Government officials have said that 
the brothers had not been under surveillance as possible terrorists. The
FBI said Friday, however, that they had interviewed Tamerlan two years 
ago at the request of an unspecified foreign government.

The
brothers spent their early years in a small community of Chechens in 
the central Asian country of Kyrgyzstan, a mainly Muslim nation of 5.5 
million. The family moved to Dagestan in in 2001, a southern Russian 
province that lies at the heart of a violent Islamist insurgency and 
where their parents now live.

In
separate interviews, the parents of the Tsarnaev brothers said they 
believed their sons were incapable of carrying out the bombings. Others 
remembered the brothers as friendly and respectful youths who never 
stood out or caused alarm.

'Somebody clearly framed them. I don't know who exactly framed them, but they did. They framed them. And they were so cowardly that they shot the boy dead,' father Anzor Tsarnaev said in an interview with Reuters in Dagestan's provincial capital, Makhachkala, clasping his head in despair.

The mother, Zubeidat Tsarnaeva, told Russia Today state television: 'It's impossible, impossible, for both of them to do such things, so I am really, really, really telling that this is a setup.'

The Russian-installed leader of Chechnya criticized police in Boston for killing an ethnic Chechen and blamed the violence on his upbringing in the United States.

The Islamic Society of Boston Cultural Center, the biggest mosque in the area, said in a statement that it was shutting its doors until further notice.

The bombings prompted contact between the United States and Russia on terrorism and the Kremlin said on Saturday that the presidents of both had agreed by telephone to increase cooperation on counter-terrorism.
