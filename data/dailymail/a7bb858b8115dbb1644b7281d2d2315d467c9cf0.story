Britain is preparing for two days of Spring like weather this week, as milder conditions sweep across the UK from the Atlantic.

But after the country sees temperatures spike at 15C, they will again drop to freezing on Friday as cold air from Iceland moves in, bringing with it blustery winds and showers.

After a spell of balmy weather this week, Met Office forecasters expect it to become progressively colder towards the end of the week.

They predict the south will enjoy the best of the warmth with temperatures predicted to climb to 15C on Wednesday and Thursday.

Meanwhile the north will be much cooler with daytime temperatures around 7C (45F).

But, come Friday, cold air from polar areas, such as Iceland and Greenland, will bring a noticeable drop in temperatures, with the cold snap set to last into next week.

Met Office forecaster Mark Wilson said colder airflow would see daytime temperatures of about 6C on Friday and into the weekend, and night-time temperatures of freezing or just below.

Eastern areas of Scotland and England should stay largely dry with sunny spells developing, but with the chance of patchy drizzle again by the end of the day, whereas Western Scotland will be quite cloudy with patchy light rain or drizzle turning to showers after midday.

Thursday will be breezy, mainly on the south coast of England, Wales and northern England, before wintry showers hit on Friday in Scotland, spreading into the north-west of England and Wales with the risk of thunder. 

The highest temperature in the UK on 18th December on record is 18C in Aber, Gwynedd back in 1972. 

Chris Burton, forecaster for The Weather Network, said: 'The changeable conditions will continue right up to Christmas Day and there are signs that at least some of us could get a white one this year, with northern high ground at the moment most likely to see some snow.

'Temperatures are briefly on the rise over the next couple of days as westerly winds draw much milder air off the Atlantic.

'By Wednesday, temperatures will reach double figures across much of the country with only the far north of Scotland seeing something a touch cooler.

'On Thursday, highs of 13-15C are possible across southern and eastern England. That's around 5-7C above what would usually be expected at this time of year.

'However, the mild weather won't last with colder air sweeping down from the north-west through Friday, with wintry showers returning to north-west Britain.'

Although the Met Office has not yet issued its forecast for the Christmas period, bookmakers are becoming increasingly convinced that snow will fall on Christmas Day.

One company, Coral, has cut the odds on a white Christmas to 4/7 anywhere in Britain, with Aberdeen the favourite at 3/1.

A final forecast by the Met Office is usually made about five days before Christmas, but spokesman Nicola McGeady said: 'The Christmas spirit is alive in punters, who are queuing up to bet on a white Christmas in their local city. As December 25 nears, the odds on it actually happening continue to fall.'

While snow could still be on the cards for the festive period in Britain, thousands of families due to leave the UK for an Alpine skiing break next weekend are facing the prospect of a green Christmas.

Many resorts across the Alps and Pyrenees had already pushed back their opening weekends from December 6 to December 13 after warm temperatures caused early snowfall in November to melt across resorts in France, Austria and Italy.

But yesterday skiers at the French resort of Les Arcs, which makes up half of the giant Paradiski skiing domain, found green meadows or slopes dusted with just a light covering where inches of snow would usually have fallen by now.

The resort's daily ski report said the nearest fresh snow was 77 miles away.
