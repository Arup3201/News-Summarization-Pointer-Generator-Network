Former Juventus midfielder Emerson has warned Paul Pogba to avoid making the same mistake he did by moving to Real Madrid.

The Brazilian midfielder left Turin for Madrid in 2006 and endured a torrid year there before leaving the following summer.

Pogba is being linked with the current European champions but Emerson claimed the prospect may not be as a attractive as it seems.

'Pogba should not make the same mistake that I made,' Emerson told Tuttosport .

'You have to start all over again when you join a new team. Pogba has a special status at Juventus and has a phenomenon like Andrea Pirlo at his side. I would think twice before making the decision to leave Juventus for Madrid.

'It is not all gold that glitters at Real Madrid. Their fans are very demanding. They always expect a new player to make the difference, even more so if a transfer fee of about 100 million euros has been paid.

'Cristiano Ronaldo will always have the backing of the fans after everything he has achieved, but it can be hard for new players who don't impress right away.'
