Bailed: Davidson, pictured with his fifth wife Michelle Cotton, was arrested as part of Operation Yewtree

Jim Davidson has pulled out of Celebrity Big Brother after he was arrested on suspicion of sexual offences yesterday by police investigating the Jimmy Savile child abuse scandal.

The 59-year-old comedian was detained at Heathrow after returning to the UK from Dubai ahead of a planned appearance on the reality TV show, which starts tonight.

Davidson was taken to a London police station and questioned for hours on suspicion of committing sexual offences before being released on bail until March.

And now MailOnline understands that Channel 5 has agreed to re-jig its line-up at the last minute after talks with the comedian.

'Everyone has agreed that it's for the best,' a source from the TV station said, but it is not yet known who will replace him.

Last night his solicitor said in a 
statement that the comedian ‘vigorously denies’ the allegations, which 
he said dated back about 25 years.

In October Davison, who formerly 
hosted BBC shows Big Break and The Generation Game, publicly labelled 
the Savile investigation a ‘witch hunt’.

On his blog he wrote: ‘The Savile 
witch hunt is going a bit silly now. We all are starting to speculate 
and accuse ... even in jest. So no, I don’t know who’s next.

‘Everyone has had the nod. Everyone is
 an expert.

'Just pick someone you don’t like and say it’s them.

'As odd 
as he was, Savile can’t defend himself.

'The bloke’s dead for God’s sake.
 Let’s move on.’

Missing: With the show now in full swing, the Big Brother House is without Jim Davidson after he pulled out

Davidson had flown to London yesterday
 to give a series of interviews in advance of his appearance on 
Celebrity Big Brother on Channel 5. 

Several plain-clothed police officers 
spent more than four hours searching Davidson’s £1million Georgian home 
in the picturesque village of Stockbridge in Hampshire.

They left the property at 7pm carrying boxes which appeared to contain plastic evidence bags and brown envelopes.

Police also arrested a 53-year-old man
 at his home in Hampshire at 8am yesterday on suspicion of committing 
sexual offences.

The suspect, who is thought to be a DJ who has worked 
with Davidson, was taken to a nearby police station for questioning.

Davidson has often courted controversy by telling offensive jokes about ethnic minorities, homosexuals and the disabled.

He has divorced four times and in 2011
 married his fifth wife, Michelle Cotton, 17 years his junior.

Last 
night his solicitor Henri Brandman said: ‘Two women have made 
allegations in respect of Jim that date back approximately 25 years. The
 complainants were then in their mid-twenties.

‘Jim vigorously denies the allegations. He answered police questions as fully as he was able after this passage of time.

‘He has not been charged with any offence. Neither he nor I will be making any further comment.’

Davidson and the 53-year-old man are 
the ninth and tenth arrests made in the Savile investigation, called 
Operation Yewtree.

Detectives are working through an arrest list of 
people who could be questioned about allegations made by victims of 
Savile or others associated with him.

A Scotland Yard spokesman said: ‘A 
53-year-old man was arrested at approximately 8am at an address in 
Hampshire and taken into custody locally.

‘A 59-year-old man was arrested at approximately midday in West London and taken into custody at a London police station.’

Arrests: Davidson and an unnamed 53-year-old were on the same day  as police investigate accusations made in the wake of revelations about disgraced Jimmy Savile

Scotland Yard said a total of 31 allegations of rape have been made against Savile so far.

And 589 people have come forward with 
information relating to the scandal, with a total of 450 complaints 
against the BBC presenter and DJ himself, mainly alleging sexual abuse, 
police said.

Held: Ted Beston was arrested by police and bailed

Ten weeks after the launch of 
Operation Yewtree, police recorded 199 crimes in 17 force areas in which
 Savile is a suspect, with 31 allegations of rape.

Others who have been arrested include 
former pop star Gary Glitter, comedian Freddie Starr and publicist Max 
Clifford. Those three are on police bail.

The
 investigation has three strands, one dealing with allegations directly 
involving Jimmy Savile, the second involving allegations against 
associates of the disgraced DJ and the third involving 'others'.

Operation Yewtree has already cost around £2million and involves a team of 30 officers.

In December a man from London in his 60s was arrested on suspicion of sexual offences.

PR guru Max Clifford was then arrested on suspicion of sexual offences but was later bailed as part of the probe.

A man aged in his 80s from Berkshire was interviewed by detectives three weeks ago.

Gary
 Glitter, comedian Freddie Starr, DJ Dave Lee Travis and a man in his 
70s, reported to be former television producer Wilfred De'Ath, have been
 arrested and bailed as part of the probe.

On Monday, Starr and Clifford were re-bailed to return on dates in February and March pending further inquiries.
