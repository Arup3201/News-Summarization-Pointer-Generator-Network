The Only Way Is Essex star Jessica Wright has already success with her autumn and spring dress collections.

Now the 27-year-old has launched her summer range and declared 'it's the sexiest one I've ever done.'

The collection includes a floral print dress cut away at the midriff, maxi dresses slashed to the hip and lacy mini dresses.

Style: Jessica Wright said she prefers backless dresses like coral one, £55, to low-cut tops

Brightening up: Her popular Alexia dress, £75, shown here in navy, also comes in bright pink for the summer

Jessica Wright told the Daily Star her boyfriend Ricky Rayment's love of lace inspired some of the designs but she added: 'I would never let a boyfriend tell me what to wear, though. It has to be my choice.'

She describes her latest collection, which includes skirts and crop tops as well as dresses, as perfect for the summer because of the bright colours and different textures.

Summery: Maya top and shorts £28 each, left, while the monochrome style also comes as a pencil skirt, £35

Fitting: The Ella dress, left, and pale pink Kristina, both £80, showcase Jessica's love of figure-hugging clothing

She added that while Essex girls are known for their 'over the top' style, she doesn't 'fit the mould' because she prefers 'classy' and 'elegant' backless dresses.

She said: 'None of my designs are particularly short or low-cut, they are super skin-tight so they show off your figure. That, to me, is sexy.'

Jessica's dresses are on sale in sizes 8 to 16 at Lipstick Boutique where her fellow TOWIE star's Amy Childs, Lauren Pope and Lydia Bright also sell their own collections.

Colourful: The Kyra, £55, left, and the Olivia, £60, which also comes in black and blue

Showing off her figure: Jessica models the Ivy, £70, left, and wears the Dixie, £65, on a recent night out

Jessica, from Brentwood, Essex, shot to fame on the reality TV show along with her brother Mark, who has since left the programme to pursue work as a presenter. She made a stab at a pop career and also has her own lingerie range.
