The owner of the meat processing plant in Wales which was shut down over its alleged role in the horse meat scandal has been revealed as a millionaire who enjoys a jet-set lifestyle.

Dafydd Raw-Rees, 64, is from a wealthy family which is well-known in the village of Llandre, near Aberystwyth.

He has been pictured holidaying on a yacht and attended a star-studded ball in Abu Dhabi, where he once attended the local Grand Prix.

His firm, Farmbox Meats, is under investigation over claims it was involved in the fraudulent production of horse meat.

The company is accused of handling meat from Peter Boddy slaughterhouse in West Yorkshire and using it to contaminate processed beef products.

Mr Raw-Rees strenuously denies any wrongdoing, and his facility has apparently remained open despite being ordered to suspend operations by the Food Standards Agency on Tuesday.

The businessman lives in a large country house near the plant with his 56-year-old wife Sarah-Jane.

The couple have been pictured making the most of their wealth - one photograph shows Mr Raw-Rees on a yacht in the Persian Gulf, while he was a guest at the Abu Dhabi Grand Prix in 2010.

Last November, they were on the red carpet with their daughter Rhian at the Abu Dhabi Chequered Flag Ball, a VIP event also attended by the likes of Leona Lewis and Jessica Ennis.

Mr Raw-Rees admitted to the Sun that he had bought meat from Mr Boddy, but said he had done the deal in good faith.

Still open: The facility appears to have carried on operating despite being shut down on Tuesday

'We tried 15 pallets, but didn't like it, that was the end of that,' he said. 'I get paid to do the cutting up, that's it.

'We don't do kebabs, mincemeat or beef burgers. This is not a processing plant.'

He said that the horse meat processed by Farmbox was exported to Belgium and did not enter the food supply in the UK.

Mr Raw-Rees insisted he could not understand the origins of the FSA's allegations against him and described them as 'baffling and ruinous'.
