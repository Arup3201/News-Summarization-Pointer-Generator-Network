A terrorist group who kidnapped nearly 300 schoolgirls in Nigeria has slaughtered hundreds of people after storming a town in the north of the country.

Boko Haram are said to have gunned down groups of unarmed civilians and set fire to a number of buildings, including a police station, during the rampage in the lawless Borno State.

The atrocity emerged as Britain announced it was sending a team of team of experts to join the hunt for the missing schoolgirls.

Downing Street revealed British security experts would be joining teams from France and the US in trying to find the girls.

The team has been drawn from Whitehall departments including Defence, International Development and the Foreign Office.

It is likely to include military officers but will concentrate on planning, co-ordination and advice to local authorities, rather than getting involved in operations on the ground to free the girls. 

In the Commons, David Cameron condemned the kidnapping as 'pure evil'. 

Speaking at Prime Minister's Questions he said: 'I'm the father of two young daughters and my reaction is the same as every father or mother in this land or the world.

'This is an act of pure evil, it has united people across the planet to stand with Nigeria to help find these children and return them to their parents.'

'The Foreign Secretary and the British Government have made repeated offers of help to the Nigerian government since the girls were seized.

Earlier a local politician described how 'hoodlums' arrived in armoured cars and threw explosives throughout the deadly 12-hour attack on Gamboru Ngala.

They are also said to have burnt 17 trailers loaded with cows and grain in a public market.

The attack happened after security personnel deployed in the town were moved to another area as part of the operation to find the abducted schoolgirls, according to the International Business Times.

A witness described how dead bodies were littered around the town while most of the buildings were destroyed.

Many residents were asleep in their houses at the time of the ambush.

Last month 273 schoolgirls aged between 12 and 16 were abducted from their boarding school in the town of Chibok.

The militant group were said to have taken the girls away in trucks after they were called back to sit an exam, but about 50 pupils managed to escape.

It has also emerged that the group had 
kidnapped another 11 girls from the village of Warabe in Borno yesterday, 
increasing the international pressure for the extremist group to be stopped and the girls returned.

Nigerian Police are now offering a £300,000 reward to anyone who can help them find the missing children.

Militant: The leader of Boko Haram, Abubakar Shekau, vows to sell the hundreds of schoolgirls kidnapped in northern Nigeria for as little as £7 during a video message

Explosion: The group have been behind a number of deadly attacks, including the bombing of Nyanya bus station in Abuja last week

Boko Haram translates into English as 'Western education is sinful'.

They heavily oppose the Westernisation of Nigeria and want to impose Sharia law.

Violence linked to the group and their insurgency is said to have led to an estimated 10,000 deaths between 2002 and 2013.

Their recent attacks include a car bomb that killed 19 people and two bus blasts which caused 70 fatalities in the capital Abuja.

On March 16, 100 people in villages across the country were killed in a series of gun attacks.

The militants are currently led by Abubakr Shekau. He is known for targeting Christians as well as politicians who oppose the Islamisation of Nigeria.

Shekau is the most wanted man in Nigeria. The US has offered a reward of £7m for information about his whereabouts.

Hundreds have been killed in a crackdown on the group by Nigerian Police, including the group's founder, Mohammed Yusuf, who died in custody.

Abubakar Shekau, the leader of Boko Haram said he would sell the remaining captives as slaves for as little as £7.

In a video, Shekau declares: 'I abducted your girls. I will sell them in the market, by Allah.'

With outrage growing over the failure to rescue the girls, thousands of Nigerians took to the streets of the country’s largest city Lagos last week to protest at their government’s inability to find the victims.

Nigerian President Goodluck Jonathan has said 
security forces are doing all they can to find the girls

It has been reported that his government is in negotiations 
with the terrorists who are demanding an unspecified ransom for the 
students' release.

The White House has branded the kidnapping an
 ‘outrage and tragedy’.

The State Department said the US are sending a
 ‘co-ordination cell’ including military personnel and law experts to 
Nigeria.

Pledging his support, President Obama said: 'We're going to do everything we can to provide assistance to them.

'In the short term our goal is obviously to help the international community, and the Nigerian government, as a team to do everything we can to recover these young ladies.'

British Special Forces have also been put on standby after Foreign Secretary William Hague described the abduction as 'disgusting and immoral'.

Military chiefs in London are 
considering sending in the Special Air Service and the Special Boat 
Service to help search for the schoolgirls.

However, Mr Hague has become frustrated with the situation, after he first offered his assistance nearly three weeks ago.

He told Sky News: 'It's difficult of course because this is primarily a matter for Nigeria and Britain can't just walk in there... and do as we like.

'It's very frustrating when the world can't act to deal with these things promptly because the trail goes cold of course after several weeks.'

A social media campaign to raise awareness globally about the kidnapping is gaining momentum with celebrities including Mary J Blige adding their support.

The mass kidnapping occurred the same day 
as a bomb blast, also blamed on Boko Haram, that killed 75 people on the
edge of Abuja and marked the first attack on the capital in two years.

The
militants repeated that bomb attack more than two weeks later in almost
exactly the same spot, killing 19 people and wounding 34 in the suburb 
of Nyanya.
