NHS managers responsible for poor care or guilty of covering it up should be banned from working in a hospital ever again, Jeremy Hunt said yesterday.

The Health Secretary unveiled a new blacklisting system under which failed hospital directors would be effectively ‘struck off’ and prevented from moving to another job in the Health Service.

He indicated that the barring regime would prevent Martin Yeates, the chief executive of Mid Staffordshire trust at the time when up to 1,200 died needlessly, from ever running an NHS trust again.

But, despite conceding that his failings as a manager contributed to the scandal, Mr Hunt yet again rode to the defence of current NHS chief executive David Nicholson.

Mr Hunt said Mr Nicholson, who headed up the local strategic health authority for nine months at the height of the scandal, could not be held solely responsible because he was in charge of too many hospitals at the time.

And, controversially, he praised the under-fire NHS chief executive for having implemented Labour’s drive to slash waiting times so effectively - despite the fact that the target culture has been blamed for the ‘culture of bullying’ which undermined care at Mid Staffs.

The Francis inquiry into poor care at the hospital, which reported last month, recommended that poor managers should be blacklisted and barred from further NHS work. Mr Hunt said yesterday that he would accept this recommendation.

He said he wanted to introduce a barring 
system to ensure that ‘there is a mechanism in place which prevents 
unsuitable board level executives and non-executives from moving to new 
senior positions elsewhere in the system’.

Ministers are considering whether the 
barring system could be extended to managers below board level, in a bid
to end the ‘revolving door’ scandal whereby poor adm

The changes announced by Health 
Secretary Jeremy Hunt do not go far enough, a leading campaigner for 
changes in the NHS said today.

Julie
Bailey, who set up the Cure The NHS group after her mother Bella died 
at Stafford Hospital in 2007, said the leadership and the "command and 
control type management" of the organisation had to change.

She
told the BBC: 'I really don't feel the changes go far enough... This 
was a failing from ward to Whitehall, we lost hundreds of people here.

'I
sat through every day of that public inquiry, all the bodies failed, 
all the bodies had to apologise, and I really don't think that's been 
addressed in this statement.

'How
many more reviews do we need to tell us the one thing that needs to 
change is the culture that needs to change, the very top, the people 
that rule the NHS, the leadership, that's what needs to change, and it 
works all the way down to the front line.

'We need safe staffing levels and the correct skill mix, that's the start that's needed, then we need to look at the training.

'We need a new leader at the top of the NHS, we need a leader that galvanises and inspires the workforce.

'We've
got staff who don't want to work for the NHS, we've got patients 
frightened, older people frightened to go into NHS hospitals.

'This
has got to change, and it's not going to change with this style 
leadership, command and control, we need much more emphasis on the 
culture and behaviours of the people within the NHS, and that starts at 
the top.'

inistrators are 
given pay-offs to leave but then take on new jobs elsewhere in the NHS.

Last week the Mail revealed that up to
2,200 managers had found another job in the NHS after having made 
redundant since the election.

Most got to keep their pay-offs - many of whom were six figures.

It also emerged that the head of a 
health trust which had the highest mortality rate in England received 
almost a quarter of a million pounds in severance pay.

Tony Halsall was paid the sum despite 
leaving his post at University Hospitals of Morecambe Bay NHS Foundation
Trust in disgrace. A police probe has now been launched into up to 16 
needless baby deaths as well as the deaths of two mothers at its 
hospitals.

Asked whether the former chief 
executive of the Mis Staffordshire trust, Martin Yeates, would be barred
under the new regime, the Health Secretary indicated that he would.

Mr Yeates was forced to resign after a damning Healthcare Commission study into death rates at his trust.

Mr Hunt said: ‘It’s a bit difficult to answer speculatively about an individual.

‘But let me say this. If you’re asking
me: “Should someone who is responsible for the appalling things at Mid 
Staffs be prevented from ever running a hospital again?” - Yes.’

However, despite his criticisms of Mr Yeates, the Health Secretary continued to stand by Mr Nicholson.

He said: ‘I have an honest difference 
of opinion with a number of people about David Nicholson’s level of 
personal responsibility for what happened, but I accept that he was a 
manager of a system that failed to stop this happening and he shares 
some responsibility for that.

‘The key point in there is that he was
in charge of 50 hospitals for a nine-month period when some of the 
awful things at Mid-Staffs were happening, and nothing in the system 
brought that to the surface; nothing in the system forced the managers -
not just him but all the managers outside the hospital - to do 
something about it.

‘What today is about is creating the structure to make it impossible for those kinds of problems to happen without being seen.’

The Health Secretary went on to praise
Mr Nicholson, saying: ‘I have looked at the evidence very carefully, 
and I think it is important to say that this is somebody who brought 
down waiting times very significantly, which has a very positive impact 
on people’s care, and has led the charge against MRSA and C. diff which 
is now at its lowest level ever since we started taking records.’

In the Commons, another Conservative MP called on Mr Nicholson to go over his Mid Staffs failings.

Bill Cash, MP for Stone, told Mr Hunt that one thing missing from yesterday’s announcement was ‘accountability’.

‘That must include the resignation of 
Sir David Nicholson and also apportion responsibility to those former 
secretaries of state who were not called to give evidence and who bear a
heavy responsibility for not having done the right thing at the right 
time,’ he said.
