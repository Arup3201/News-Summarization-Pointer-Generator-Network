Eliot Spitzer's ex-wife finally has something to smile about after the details of her multimillion-dollar divorce settlement from the disgraced 'Luv Guv' were revealed today.

Silda Wall Spitzer gets a $7.5million payout and to keep her luxury Fifth Avenue apartment overlooking Central Park in Manhattan as part of the deal.

The ex-New York governor's former wife, who grimly stood by him when his predilection for expensive call girls came to light in 2008, will also receive $240,000-a-year maintenance for life.

Three months after ending their 26-year marriage, details of Silda's massive 'post-nuptial' agreement have been revealed at RadarOnline.

Other perks of the 56-year-old's deal include a new car 'no more than every five years', a housekeeper, accountant, unspecified 'entertainment and activities expenses', a $100,000-per-year charity donation and a part-time assistant.

Mr Spitzer will also take care of his former wife's medical insurance and health care.

Although the multimillionaire does not have to pay child support to Silda for their daughters - Elyssa, 24, Sarabeth, 21, and Jenna, 19 - he must take care of 100 per cent of their medical, dental and college expenses.

The former couple agreed to shared use of their $5million upstate New York farm. However the divorce agreement states that the 'choice of visitors' cannot cause their daughters any emotional distress or embarrassment.

The Spitzers divorce was finalized in February this year and it was agreed that Silda would receive the first $1million within 180 days.

Another $1million will follow on the service of their divorce judgement and then at least $500,000 ever year unless the former politician decides to pay his ex a lump sum.

The annual $240,000 maintenance payment will come to Silda after her former husband has paid the taxes. It will continue until she either remarries or dies.

New York Governor Eliot Spitzer addresses the media with his wife Silda Wall Spitzer on March 10, 2008 following revelations that he spent $100,000 on prostitutes

Division of assets: Silda and Eliot Spitzer lived in an apartment on Manhattan's Fifth Avenue that belonged to his father, real estate mogul Bernard Spitzer. The divorce settlement gives her exclusive use of the luxury home which overlooks Central Park

As part of her divorce from disgraced governor Eliot Spitzer, his ex-wife Silda will receive:

Silda stood by her disgraced Democrat 
husband when he admitted he was the infamous 'Client No.9' and had spent $100,000 on prostitutes in March 
2008, including call girl Ashley Dupre.

The couple announced their divorce with 'regret' in a joint public
 statement on Christmas Eve last year, after photos emerged of Spitzer, 
54, sneaking into the Soho apartment of his 31-year-old publicist girlfriend 
Lis Smith. 

Eliot Spitzer, who is worth an estimated $46million, comes from a real estate fortune built by his father Bernard Spitzer.

He had earnings of $4.2million for 2012 while Silda Wall Spitzer brought home $112,000 as an executive at NewWorld Capital Group, a private equity firm investing in new energy.

If
 his ex-wife is forced to move from her Fifth Avenue home at any point, 
Spitzer has agreed to set her up in a 'replacement residence of similar 
size, quality and location', according to the documents also seen by the
 New York Post. 

Spitzer
 had a failed political 'comeback'
 campaign to become New York City's new comptroller last year, 
masterminded by current girlfriend Lis Smith. Silda Spitzer was never seen on the campaign trail with her husband.

She then joined Bill 
de Blasio's team and was widely considered to be the likely candidate 
for the mayor's press secretary.

Just as the final staffing decision was due to be made, photos were released that showed the former governor, who resigned years ago after admitting to soliciting prostitutes, sneaking in and out of Smith's Soho apartment in December.

Now after spending the past few months under the radar, Smith is actively trying to restart her consulting career. She is now working for the Democratic Governor's Association, paying close attention to Governor Martin O'Malley of Maryland who is considered a possible 2016 candidate should Hillary Clinton choose not to run for president.

Ashley Dupre was the call girl at the center of former New York Governor Eliot Spitzer's sex scandal in 2008

Spitzer was introduced to his new girlfriend's family over Christmas and the couple took a romantic trip to Jamaica over the New Year - which reportedly included an amorous session inside an outdoor hot-tub.

Spitzer, who was once considered a future presidential candidate, met his wife Silda at Harvard Law School in 1987.

The couple had three daughters as Spitzer rose the ranks from successful lawyer to prosecutor in the Manhattan District Attorney's office. He became state Attorney General in 1998 and found fame as the 'Sheriff of Wall Street' - going after corrupt financiers.

His moral authority and intellect helped catapult him into the governor's office in 2007 - however he resigned in disgrace just a year later after being revealed to have used prostitutes.

Infamous as Client 9 of the Emporers Club VIP call-girl ring, he resigned at a public press conference with his wife by his side.

He then attempted to rehabilitate his public image with a stint presenting a CNN news show which failed and then eventually made his way back to work for his father.
