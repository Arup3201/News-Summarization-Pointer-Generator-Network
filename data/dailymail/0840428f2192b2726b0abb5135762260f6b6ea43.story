James Bond star Daniel Craig and his wife Rachel Weisz have denied claims that they offered a homeowner around £5million for his Grade II listed converted mill. 

The A-list couple were said to be in negotiations to buy an 18th century converted mill in Warwickshire, but Craig's spokeswoman said this was incorrect.

It was also reported that the pair have been house-hunting in the area for more than a year, but it has been confirmed that the couple are not looking to buy another property.

Daniel Craig and Rachel Weisz have denied claims that they are interested in buying a converted mill in Warwickshire for around £5million

The converted 18th century mill in question has eight-bedrooms and is valued at £5,209,656.

It was listed to rent on Rightmove for £807 per week or £3,495 per month back in September 2010.

Owner, Matt Sutherland, 38, confirmed negotiations are underway with an 'A-list' buyer and said he is prepared to sell if the price is right.

He added: 'While it wouldn't be right to name the person, I can confirm we had an approach through an agent from an A-list celebrity.

The 18th century rural property has spacious living areas with low ceilings and wooden beams 

'The person in question was shown pictures of my house and later came down to look around for himself with his assistant.

'The house wasn't on the market but I am willing to sell if the figure is right.'

Asked if a £5million offer would swing it, Mr Sutherland, who works as an investment and business adviser in films and technology, said: 'That's around the ballpark price.'

Stunning pictures show the property still has its original 18th century chimney as well as a large wooden water wheel in the back garden.

Interior images show rooms - including one featuring a piano - with stone floors and low ceilings complete with wooden beams.  

The couple – who met on the set of movie Dream House in 2011 - tied the knot in a secret ceremony attended by just four people in New York State in June 2011.
