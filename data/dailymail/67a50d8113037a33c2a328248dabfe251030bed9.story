Despite the best efforts of Cristiano Ronaldo and co, style, says photographer Giuseppe Santamaria, is about much more than owning the latest trainers or an expensive suit.

Instead, he says, it's all about expression and staying true to yourself. If that sounds baffling, then the street style specialist's new book, Men In This Town, ought to help.

Packed with glossy photos of Sydney, London, Milan and New York's most stylish men, the dapper gents pictured have little in common with Ronaldo and his wardrobe of garish Gucci.

Instead, there's the New York businessman in grey tweed, a brown fedora, stylish sunnies and a natty pocket square, and the East London hipster who manages to make an eye-wateringly bright pair of mustard cords and a patterned shirt look achingly cool.

Others are dapper in classic homburg hats and trench coats, neat striped blazers and cream chinos and even, in one case, manage to breathe new life into the well-worn pale blue shirt and jeans combo.

There's little to tie the men together, apart, that is, from confidence. 'The main thing that catches my eye when 
I’m out taking photos is confidence,' adds Santamaria.

'It’s in how someone holds 
themselves when they think nobody is looking. If you got that, you’ll 
stand out on the street, even if you’re not trying to.'

But style, of the fashionable kind, is something that Santamaria knows well. Born in Toronto, the photographer and art director lived in New York before moving to Sydney and has worked on campaigns for Nespresso and Peroni, as well as on editorial features for GQ Australia and many more.

As a result, he's got a few style ideas of his own although they do boil down into one key commandment: wear what you love.

'Don’t follow the trends too much,' he adds, wisely. 'If you
 do, have fun with them but add something unique to the look that 
express’ something about you. Keep it individual.'

With such emphasis on individuality, it's no surprise that one of his favourite cities to snap is London, where, in trendy areas such as Shoreditch, locals can be seen wearing anything from silver skirts to skinny jeans.

'I loved shooting the streets of London,' he enthuses. 'I
 love the sense of tradition yet done with such a modern spin. London men
 are very much into what’s going on in fashion and stay on top of it.'

That doesn't mean, however, that he doesn't love the scene in Sydney and New York. 'Men’s style is Sydney is very eclectic,' he muses.

'It’s a city where men on the mainstream are finally starting to 
experiment with fashion. It’s a time of experimentation and trying new 
things, which is leading to some flamboyant looks.'

And New York? New York, he says, is both fun and trend focused. 'The men of New York have the most fun 
with fashion I think.

'It’s where trends appear on the 
streets, resulting in a more urban and cool look. New York is the land 
of big box stores but the guys know how to make their style unique.'
