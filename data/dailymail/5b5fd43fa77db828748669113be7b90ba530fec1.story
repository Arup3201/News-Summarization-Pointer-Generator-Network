Frightening: John Whittingdale, Tory chairman of the Commons culture, media and sport select committee, said Britain is losing the information war

Russia and China are winning a propaganda war because of cuts to the BBC World Service, a senior MP has warned.

As a result Britain is failing to counter the biased information put out by the two superpowers, said John Whittingdale, Tory chairman of the Commons culture, media and sport select committee.

‘We are being outgunned massively by the Russians and Chinese. It is frightening the extent to which we are losing the information war,’ he said.

And Peter Horrocks, who stepped down as head of the World Service this month, claims cuts to its budget could put UK national interests at risk. ‘Medium to long term there has to be an anxiety about the spending of others compared to what the BBC are putting into it.

'You can take a view of the overall national interest and things we spend on international influence, like military spending. When you look at that it would take it in a certain direction.’ 

Funding for the World Service switched this year from the Foreign Office to the BBC and now comes out of the licence fee. 

Although in June 2013, the BBC Trust announced that the World Service budget would rise from £238.5million to £245million, it follows years of cuts. 

In 2010, the Foreign Office cut the World Service budget by 16 per cent.

Kremlin-backed news channel Russia Today, which David Cameron accused of ‘pumping out a distorted picture’ of events in Ukraine, will see its budget increased by 40 per cent next year to £220million.

It has opened a UK-focused channel and claims a global audience of 644million in 100 countries, compared with the World Service’s 191.4million.

However, since the troubles ignited in Ukraine, with Russian troops moving into the east of the country, demand for the World Service has soared. The corporation’s Russian-language service has more than doubled to 6.9 million listeners, while in Ukraine its audience has trebled to more than 600,000 since last year.

Whittingdale has said he will seek assurances from James Harding, the head of BBC News, that the World Service will be maintained as a counterweight broadcasters such as Russia Today. 

He said: ‘The clear commitment that has been given by Russia and China [to expand state-run news channels in Europe] strengthens the case why we should be backing the World Service.’
