The elite University of California, Berkeley has seen a blow to its uber-serious reputation with a controversial article from a student boasting about her marathon campus sex sessions.

Nadia Cho's detailed account was part of her weekly column in The Daily Californian, Berkeley’s independent, student-run newspaper.

Cho writes
 that she and an unnamed male student started their romp in Berkeley’s 
library, Main Stacks, the day before Thanksgiving, when the campus was 
‘marvellously empty’.

Berkeley Student Nadia Cho's Twitter Profile reads: 'i like coffee, cats, and ice cream. and being the sex on tuesday columnist at the @dailycal :)'

But other students were in the library studying while the two performed and more than one student walked by them in mid-act, Cho writes.

She and her partner then moved into one of Berkeley’s classrooms, as she graphically describes.

‘Sex isn’t always about c****** and having orgasms. Sometimes it’s for s**** and giggles,’ she writes.

‘Having expectations and goals can 
ruin the fun of it. Besides, it’s probably not a good idea to ejaculate 
in public places - just saying. Keep this in mind should you ever 
attempt sex on campus.’

Not so private: The Main Stacks library at Berkeley University, where Cho says she and an unnamed male student had sex

Cho writes that her experience was inspired by a spring 2012 column for the paper, ‘Sex on campus: actually doable?’

Her response: ‘yes - having sex on campus is actually very doable, and it’s lots of fun. It’s also surprisingly easy.’

The Daily Californian has a history of publishing controversial editorials, and in some cases issues containing brash statements have led to newspaper theft - a form of censorship where free newspapers are stolen in bulk to cut down on readership.

In 2002, former Berkeley mayor Tom Bates pleaded guilty to stealing and trashing 1,000 copies of an issue of The Daily Californian that carried an endorsement of his opponent Shirley Dean, who was mayor at the time.

Bates beat Dean two days later and took over office.

After Bates’ admittance a year later, stealing free newspapers in Berkeley became punishable.

Bates paid a $100 fine for his infraction and promised to support a local ordinance against newspaper theft.

The
 Daily Californian published its first issue in 1871 and is one of the 
oldest college newspapers in the U.S. It became independent from UC
Berkeley in 1971.

The paper, which is now published by the Independent Berkeley Students Publishing Company, has a circulation of about 10,000 and a readership of about 42,000, according to its advertising information.

A spokeswoman for the university said: 'The Daily Cal is not an official university newspaper, it is a student-run, public newspaper and they do not have our backing.

'We have known about that column for a long time but there is nothing we can do about it. The students have a right to free speech.'

Cho could not be reached about her story.
