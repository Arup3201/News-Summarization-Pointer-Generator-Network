Cardinals fans hurled racist comments at a group protesting on behalf of black teenager Michael Brown following a game on Monday night, startling video has revealed.

Footage taken by Argus Streaming News shows a large group of sports fans gathered outside Busch Stadium in St Louis, Missouri as protesters wave placards nearby.

The protesters, all of whom appear to be black, were there to call for justice for Michael Brown, the unarmed 18-year-old who was shot dead by Officer Darren Wilson in Ferguson on August 9.

Just seconds into the video, a white fan can be seen yelling at the group: 'Get a job!'

Clash: Cardinals fans can be seen yelling at a group protesting for justice for Michael Brown, the black teenager who was shot dead by a white police officer in August. The groups clashed after Monday's game

Protest: The Ferguson protesters, pictured, yelled that the sports fans were looking at democracy - but the fans responded by telling them to get a job and pull up their pants. Police officers did not intervene

The man turns to the camera and says: 'That's right! If they'd be working, we wouldn't have this problem!' 

As the protesters shout 'Justice for Mike Brown', the fans drown them out with cries of 'Let's go Cardinals' which quickly become 'Let's go Darren' - referring to the cop who killed the teenager.

Later in the video, a white woman yells at the protesters, 'We're the ones who gave all y'all the freedoms that you have!' before other fans yell 'Africa!' and 'USA! USA! USA!' 

Soon after, another fan tells a protester to take off his hat and 'pull up your pants'. 

One protester even sticks a piece of paper to the back of his jersey reading: 'I am Darren Wilson'.

Still, the protesters refuse to give up, with one man telling the sports fans that they are watching democracy. The group continues to shout: 'We young, we strong, we marching all night long.'

At one point, a woman confronted the man filming the video, Argus News' Mustafa Hussein, a former Marine.

'Why are you here?' she says. 'I don't believe you're a veteran. What are you?'

'What do you mean what am I?' Hussein says. 'What race am I? I'm a f***ing Marine.'

'OK - from what level? How far did you get?' she asks, before walking away.

Hussein later spoke with the Riverfront Times about the video, and said not a single fan tried to have a rational conversation with the protesters.

'That's sad that it gives our city a really bad look,' he said. 'The sad part about it is the fans that were there, you have no idea if they came in for the playoff game from outside the St. Louis area. 

'It really portrays St. Louis as super racist... but there's no way to prove those fans were from here.'

Killed: Officer Darren Wilson, left, shot dead 18-year-old Michael Brown in broad daylight on August 9

A grand jury is expected to decide next month whether to bring criminal charges against police officer Wilson.

In differing accounts, police have said Brown struggled with Wilson, 28, before the fatal shots were fired, but some witnesses say Brown held up his hands and was surrendering when he was shot multiple times in the head and chest.

If charges are not brought against Wilson, police fear an outbreak of violence not just in the St. Louis suburb of Ferguson, but across the greater metropolitan area and even in other U.S. cities, according to St. Louis County Police Chief Jon Belmar and others involved in the planning meetings.

Police officers in Missouri are meeting almost daily leading up to that decision to ready themselves for all possible scenarios, while also talking with other major police departments around the country.
