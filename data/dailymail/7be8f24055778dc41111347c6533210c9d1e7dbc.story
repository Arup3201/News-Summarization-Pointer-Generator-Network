It's Christmas time and it isn't just a season of good will and cheer, it's also the most likely time to conceive.

National Birth Records for the UK indicate the most birthdays fall in September - making December a prime baby-making month.

Some parents may plot a December conception on purpose to achieve an all-important September birthday, making their child one of the oldest in their class at school which has been proven to give them an academic advantage.

Love is in the air: The festive spirit helps many couples conceive in December

But other couples struggling with fertility issues aren't as lucky as to be able to plan a conception.

So Jo Hemmings, relationship expert for We-Vibe, said December can also be an excellent opportunity for those who have been trying for a baby to finally get lucky.

She explains: 'If you are trying for a baby, Christmas 
is a great opportunity to make the most of your time off together. And the cold weather also means that your partner's sperm quality is higher too.

'Trying to conceive puts pressure and stress on couples, but remember to 
enjoy the experience.'

Jo recommends women keen to conceive should make the most of the cosy nights in the winter months provide and have some fun rather than stressing about getting pregnant.

She said: 'It's important to enjoy the simple 
pleasures of sex and not just save it for when you're at your most 
fertile,’ says Jo. ‘Conceiving a baby should be a joyous affair, however
 long it takes. If you get stuck in the routine of only having sex on 
your fertile days, it can be difficult to see making love as anything 
more than a baby-making process.'

She added: ‘December is the ideal time to reconnect
 sexually with your partner - it's what cosy winter nights were meant 
for! Watch a sexy movie together or dress up
 and role-play in some seductive kit. Many outfits include props like 
gloves, feather boas or corsets. They always feel appropriate in the 
winter.

'Get out those stockings and suspenders, which 
probably haven't seen the light of day during the summer months.'

Be safe: Christmas festivities can also lead to some unplanned pregnancies if contraception is forgotten in a drunken fling

But while some couples may be hoping December will bring them a much-longed for baby, others might find it an unwelcome consequence of the festive season.

Jo explained: 'The lead up to Christmas is becoming ever longer. It's party season, we're in a good mood and the drink is flowing. It's easy to be forgetful in all the merriment. It's not only a time of celebration, it's also the month when we're likely to forget to use our contraception.'

For those who don't want to end up with a baby in 2014 thanks to a drunken festive fling, she has the following advice.

'If you're on the pill, try and take it at a regular time each morning in December, perhaps leaving the packet on your bedside table as a reminder for you, if you're tempted to forget. 

'If you use a barrier method of contraception, such as a cap, pop it in before you go out for the evening. Alternatively, invest in a few festive condoms - there are loads of fun varieties available - and keep those in your bag or again, on the bedside table. That way you'll be making seasonal merriment without making a baby!'
