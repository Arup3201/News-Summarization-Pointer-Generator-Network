A puffer fish that developed cataracts has undergone surgery to have its eye removed, in what is thought to be one of the first operations of its kind in Britain.

Vets at Bristol Zoo operated on Mini the puffer fish when its right eye became painfully swollen.

The fish had to be kept out of the water for the duration of the painstaking hour-long operation, so the team constantly passed medicated water over Mini's gills to keep its skin wet.

After: Staff at Bristol Zoo removed Mini's right eye after the puffer fish developed cataracts

The operation was a success and vets in Bristol said Mini was now back 'swimming happily in her tank' - albeit minus one eye.

Jonny
 Rudd, assistant curator at Bristol Zoo, said: 'We had to move quickly to help. The eye
 was very swollen so it became apparent she was going to need an 
operation.

'The intricacy of the area meant it was also apparent it would need to be done out of the water.

'Maintaining
 anaesthesia in a fish out of water can be challenging, as it involves 
constantly passing medicated water over the gills of the fish and 
keeping the skin wet.

'The vet
 team managed to remove the eye in an operation that lasted one hour. 
Once the anaesthetic had worn off Mini was returned to a tank behind the
 scenes where she was given antibiotics and lots of treats, including 
mussels in shells or her favourite, shore crabs, over the course of a 
month.

'It took a little while
 to prepare Mini for surgery by adjusting the concentration of 
anaesthetic in the water but the procedure itself went very well. Mini 
is now back where she belongs, swimming happily in her tank.'
