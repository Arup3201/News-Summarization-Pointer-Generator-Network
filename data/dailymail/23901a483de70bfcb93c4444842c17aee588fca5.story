Real Madrid scored became the first team to score 1,000 goals in European football when Karim Benzema found the net against Basle on Tuesday night.

The French striker brought up the club's landmark after a delightful interchange with Cristiano Ronaldo gave him time in the visitors box to drill home via the crossbar.

Earlier an own goal by Marek Suchy, as well as strikes from Gareth Bale, Ronaldo and James Rodriguez had put Madrid 4-1 up, and taken them to the brink of one thousand goals.

VIDEO Ancelotti pleased with Real reaction

It is no surprise that Real, the most successful side in European football with ten European titles to their name, were the first to reach the figure, and they did it in style, beating Basle 5-1 at the Bernabeu.

But manager Carlo Ancelotti was not getting carried away after the victory, which came on the back of successive domestic defeats. 

'It's clear that not everything has been solved but I liked the reaction of the team,' he told a news conference.

'It's normal that people get nervous if you lose two games at the start of the season.'
