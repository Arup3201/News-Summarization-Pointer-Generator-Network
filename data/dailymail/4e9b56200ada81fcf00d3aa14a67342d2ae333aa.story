Everyone knows an estate agent’s claims should always be treated with caution.

But one firm really stretched the limits of imagination – by claiming Luton was a suburb of London.

RE/MAX Property Centre’s advert said its luxury flats in the Bedfordshire town were ‘close to one of the world’s leading financial districts and in one of the most cosmopolitan areas of London’. 

In the heart of London? An advert for these £500,000 flats in Luton boasted that they have the 'City's famous landmarks  right on your doorstep' - despite a season ticket to the capital costing almost £4,000

Salubrious: The site of the flats, which will overlook a dual carriageway, court, pub and shopping centre

Generous: The advert which prompted bemusement from councillors... and clarified the distance further down

It went on: ‘Many of the city’s famous landmarks, extensive transport routes, social and cultural attractions right on your doorstep . . . it’s the way you’ve always imagined city living to be.’

That seems unlikely, because Luton is 35 miles from London – or a 23-minute train journey, for which a season ticket costs all of £3,924. Going by car takes far longer, partly thanks to M1 traffic. 

The 130 flats and 359 student rooms overlook a busy dual carriageway, a casino, a pub and the crown court – but a two-bed penthouse costs £534,751, while one-bedroom flats are £354,000.

RE/MAX Property Centre is selling the flats for Sloane International Developers. Last night, it altered the advert text after MailOnline highlighted the disparity.

One Luton local, who asked not to be named, said yesterday: ‘I’m proud of where I’m from, but there aren’t many social and cultural attractions near my doorstep. 

'They must be hoping rich foreign students will buy the flats without checking the details.’

Visitor Rachel Watts, 28, said: ‘I know London’s expensive but you could buy a two-bed apartment for half a million quid couldn’t you? Why spend it here?’

Tom Shaw, the local councillor responsible for housing, said high prices in London meant people were moving to Luton, pushing the cost of ex-council houses to £170,000. 

But he said £500,000 even for high-end flats required ‘a bit of imagination’.

‘For a property on a flyover opposite student accommodation, I don’t know who would list it for that,’ he said. 

The flats, complete with gym and 24-hour concierge, have not yet been built, but are due to be completed in 2016. 

A condition of planning permission was that the project would include affordable housing, and student rooms will be available from £56,000.

The development is not the only thing in the area to lean rather heavily on its link to the capital – for years, London Luton Airport has been confusing tourists, who arrive in the UK only to find they still have a long journey ahead.

Luton topped a list of Britain’s worst places to live in the book Crap Towns II in 2004.

Some 1,800 people voted it the grimmest place in the UK. Despite it having 185,000 residents at the time, just five wrote in to defend it.

RE/MAX said the market for the flats was typically investors in China and Malaysia.

Owner Tim Marshall said he would modify the description in the ad. 

He said: ‘We apologise for the error, and trust that this typographical error can be treated as such and was not a deliberate attempt to mislead.’

LONDON OXFORD AIRPORT 

Also known as Kidlington Airport, it was controversially rebranded in 2009 despite being 60 miles from the capital.

LONDON ASHFORD AIRPORT

It was renamed in a bid to turn it into a thriving regional hub, despite being in Lydd, Kent - half an hour's drive from Ashford. Ashford is then 38 minutes by high-speed train, or well over an hour normally, from London.

LONDON STANSTED AIRPORT

Aside from being 40 miles from the capital, the airport's Stansted Express was rapped by the advertising watchdog in 2010 when it claimed trains took just 35 minutes to reach London. The destination was actually Tottenham Hale, eight miles from the West End.

MK DONS

There was a row over the team relocating in 2003 to Milton Keynes from Wimbledon, the origin of the 'Dons' in its name. The name remained, but the club relinquished all claim to its history and returned old trophies to London.

...AND 'LONDON PRESTWICK' AIRPORT

Ryanair sparked a wee controversy in 2006 when it advertised flights from Norway to 'London Prestwick Airport'... in Scotland, around 400 miles from the capital.
