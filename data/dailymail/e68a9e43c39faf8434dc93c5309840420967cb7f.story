A 13-year-old girl who underwent gastric sleeve surgery after gaining more than 150lbs and barely being able to move her body has completed her first 5K race a year after the life-saving weight loss procedure.

Alexis Shapiro, from Cibolo, Texas, who suffers from hypothalamic obesity, a condition that leaves her constantly hungry and unable to lose weight, weighed 203lbs in 2014 despite being only 4'7. After she was denied weight loss surgery by her health insurer because she was 'too young', her parents started an online crowdfunding campaign and raised more than $86,000 to cover the medical costs. 

'I still really believe the surgery saved her life,' her 35-year-old mom Jenny Shapiro told People. 'I don't even know if we would be here. Seeing her do a 5K was just icing on the cake.'

Making strides: Alexis Shapiro completed her first 5K race this month (pictured). Last year, the 13-year-old underwent gastric sleeve surgery to help her lose more than 50lbs 

Last year, competing in a race would have been impossible for Alexis, who was almost always in pain because of her size.

She began rapidly gaining weight after she sought treatment for her rare brain tumor in 2011; the surgery to remove the benign tumor caused damage to her hypothalamus and led to the development of hypothalamic obesity.

After gaining 150lbs over the course of two years she developed type 2 diabetes and other obesity-related problems.

Alexis had the life-saving surgery last March, but due to complications doctors were forced to perform a gastric sleeve surgery instead of the scheduled gastric bypass.

Puppy love: Alexis can be seen cuddling on the couch with her dog last month 

She returned to school six months later after she lost more than 60lbs.

But managing Alexis' weight is still a constant struggle.

Her mom, who said 'hypothalamic obesity is a beast', admitted to the outlet that her daughter had since put eight to 10lbs back on her frame.

Alexis continues to take steroids and growth hormones every day because her brain tumor surgery also left her with panhypopituitarism, a syndrome marked by decreased secretion of most pituitary hormones.

Although the treatments make her feel ill and cause her to miss school at least once a week, Alexis is happier than she has been in a long time. 

'Alexis has a confidence about her that she didn’t have before,' Jenny said. 'She's gaining independence little by little and becoming her own person.'

Jenny also noted that her daughter, who was once home-schooled, now has friends in her class.

She maintained that, despite the ongoing complications Alexis is forced to deal with, the surgery was 'really good' for her.

'I'm baffled by how well she does, especially at her age,' Jenny said. 'She's such a tough girl.'
