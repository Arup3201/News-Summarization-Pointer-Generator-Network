With her drooping whiskers and doleful eyes, Pixie certainly looks like the cat that got the sour cream.

Now the two-year-old pedigree Persian is being touted as Britain’s saddest-looking feline and a worthy challenger to US internet sensation Grumpy Cat.

Grumpy, who was born with dwarfism and an underbite, giving her a disgruntled expression, has built a £60million empire thanks to her unfortunate looks.

If Grumpy could smile, it would surely be wiped from her whiskers were she to learn of her rival in the miserable moggy stakes. 

And it seems Pixie could well surpass Grumpy’s success because of her bubbly personality – in contrast to her mournful looks. 

Owner Sophie Batt, 24, said: ‘People always say how sad Pixie looks, but she’s so cute and cuddly, and has a huge personality.

‘She does have her glum moments and goes off in lots of sulks, but she’s anything but sad.’

The hairdresser, who lives in Bristol with her boyfriend Jason Brown, 34, bought Pixie as a kitten for £350. 

‘When we saw her miserable face we just fell in love immediately,’ said Miss Batt, who has previously only posted a handful of photographs of Pixie as a kitten on her Facebook page.

‘We’ve dedicated our lives to making her first two years the happiest they can possibly be. Even if her sourpuss face doesn’t show it, her personality shows how happy she really is.’

Grumpy became an internet sensation in 2012 when owner Tabatha Bundesen’s brother posted a photo of her online which went viral. 

Grumpy’s fame led to her becoming the spokescat for Friskies, a popular U.S. catfood brand, and her first book, Grumpy Cat: A Grumpy Book, made the prestigious New York Times bestseller list.

Even the prospect of stardom can't seem to lift Pixie's frown after she is touted as the next Grumpy Cat

This month she has been on tour in America promoting her second book, The Grumpy Guide to Life. 

A recent post on her official website shows her looking as grumpy as ever alongside the words: ‘I went on a book tour once. It was awful.’

Some 6.3 million people like her official Facebook page and she has 232,000 Twitter followers.
