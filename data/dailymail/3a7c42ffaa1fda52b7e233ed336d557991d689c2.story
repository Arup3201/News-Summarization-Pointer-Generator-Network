When Patti and David Bailey appeared on Dragons’ Den seeking investment for Motormouse, the company  they ran from their 17th Century manor house in the Warwickshire countryside, the business took off.

With the profits from selling their computer mice  in the shape of classic cars, they were able to transform the four-bedroom house and complete a renovation they started in 2002.

The money enabled them to add a steam room, hot tub, one-bedroom apartment over the triple garage, a vast conservatory and a helipad that doubles as a putting green and croquet lawn.

The four-bedroom 17th Century Wheetley Manor House in Warwickshire, also comes with a one-bedroom flat above the triple garage

‘It had originally been three farmworkers’ cottages, apparently housing 28 people, but  in the 19th Century the Earl of Evesham claimed it, kicked them out, turned it into a single home and called it the Manor House,’ says Patti, 56, who runs her own business as a consultant to the building industry.

‘On the night Dragons’ Den went out, our website received 3,500 hits per second, and the company that hosted the site thought we were under cyber attack and shut it down – until they realised they were real customers,’ says David, 57.

The firm was born after a party for which Patti baked a cake topped with a Corgi  model of a Bentley Continental GT – David’s dream car.

‘A couple of days later I was sitting at my desk rolling the car up and down and it struck me that it was just like moving a mouse,’  said David.

He tried to find a firm that made car-shaped mice, but when he couldn’t, he started Motormouse.

Spacious: The £1.25million property's summer house overlooks the garden lake

Modern interior: The current owners, entrepreneurial couple Patti and David Bailay, have made sure the house is in shipshape

Paying off: Since their success with Motormouse, the Baileys have been able to add  a hot tub, one-bedroom apartment over the triple garage, a vast conservatory and a helipad/putting green

That was five years ago. The business quickly outgrew the Manor House in Wheethley, near Alcester, in the middle of the 3,000-acre Ragley Estate close  to the Worcestershire border. Now the house has outgrown Patti and David, and they want to move.

‘We want to downsize,’ says David, who is not a man to sit still for long, and did much of the work on the house himself. ‘We’ve always bought and renovated houses, and now I’d like to build one from scratch  and project manage it myself.’

Moving on: David and Patti Bailey are selling to downsize

Selling the house, which is on the market with Fine & Country for £1.25 million, should not be too difficult.

As well as the immaculate accommodation, it has delightful gardens and spectacular views. Its two acres of land include a summer house in the style  of a Bajan rum shack and a vast lake, which is home to the couple’s pets – two ducks and two geese – and is stocked with fish.

Jonathan Handford, of Fine & Country,  says the local market has performed steadily and he is confident of finding a buyer.

‘House prices have gone up 4.8 per cent in Warwickshire in the past 12 months,’ he adds.

He adds that there is interest from people  in Stratford-upon-Avon, which is 12 miles away, who want to be further out ‘in the sticks’, as well as people moving from London who want to hide away in the country but still need good commuter access  to Birmingham (20 minutes by car) and  to airports.

While the house is for sale, so is the business, and the couple are in talks with several buyers.

‘We only ever intended  to run it for five years and  I now have another idea  that I’m discussing  with big retailers,’  says David.

The couple say for the past five years they have been helping former dragon James Caan sift through hundreds of entrepreneurs who approach him every week.  ‘We became mini dragons,’ says Patti.
