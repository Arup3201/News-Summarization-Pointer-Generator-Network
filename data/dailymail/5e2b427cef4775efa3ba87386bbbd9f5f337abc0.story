Recovery: Anthony Margrave, 40, spent three days in a ditch after crashing his motorcycle

A motorcyclist who lay severely 
injured in a ditch for almost three days before miraculously being found alive has 
spoken for the first time about his terrifying ordeal.

Anthony
Margrave, 40, sparked a huge police search of rivers, reservoirs 
fields, ditches, houses and gardens when he went missing after setting 
off from his home in Rawcliffe Bridge, East Yorks., to test out his new 
Yamaha motorcycle.

He had crashed and tumbled into a 6ft-deep ditch during the accident on September 11.

His
cries for help went unheard but he couldn’t save himself due to the 
extent of his injuries and was forced to wait until he was found. 
Incredibly, in the early hours of the third search day a small amount of
debris was found at the side of a road by Humberside Police officers, 
who launched a search of the immediate area.

Anthony
was found alongside the busy A614 later the same day, between East 
Cowick and Thorne, lying in the water-filled ditch, conscious and 
breathing.

Mr Margrave was rushed to Doncaster Royal Infirmary where he was sedated and placed on a ventilator in intensive care.

He was suffering from hypothermia, a fractured spine, broken ribs and needed surgery to clear his airway.

Lucky Anthony, who suffered 
hypothermia, dehydration and severe injuries including a fractured 
spine, has now spoken out from Sheffield’s Northern General Hospital 
about how lucky he is to be alive - and how he hopes to be back home 
within six months.

Rescue: Anthony Margrave crashed while out testing his new motorcycle on this A-road in South Yorkshire and was not discovered for three days

'It’s a miracle how they ever found me,' he said.

'I
have a spinal cord injury which means I am going to be in a wheelchair 
for quite a while but I am here and that’s the main thing.

'I
couldn’t even move my arms at first, I’ve got a lot of movement back 
but it’s not brilliant. I still can’t bend my fingers but time will 
tell, I’m just taking every day as it comes.

'It could be six months or a year before I get out of hospital but I have been progressing really well so I am hoping for six months.'

It
is thought Anthony collided with a metal signpost on the off-side of 
the carriageway and travelled approximately 200 metres further along the
carriageway before coming to rest in the ditch where he was hidden from
view.

According to his sister Sharon 
Margrave, 42, his first concerns were for his bike and he was devastated
to learn it was a complete write-off.

Anthony spent Christmas Day in hospital where he was visited by his sister Sharon and her two children.

Speaking
after Anthony was found, Sharon, 42, said: 'Relief isn’t the word, he 
went missing on the Tuesday night and he was found on Friday morning.

'When
you think your brother’s dead, it’s an horrendous ordeal. We couldn’t 
eat or sleep, our niece and family were searching fields, they were 
looking in fields and could hear the police helicopter.

'It’s
a miracle he was found alive, he doesn’t know what happened, he 
remembers heading towards the field and then the ditch. He couldn’t move
to get to his phone'.
