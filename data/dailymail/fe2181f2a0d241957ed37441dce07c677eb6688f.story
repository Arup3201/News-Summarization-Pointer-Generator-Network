An Oscar winner admitted that he tried to kill himself when he was 16 and urged kids who feel different to 'stay weird' as he accepted the award.

Graham Moore took the opportunity to raise awareness about depression and suicide when he collected the Academy Award for Best Adapted Screenplay for the Imitation Game.

The Columbia University graduate first paid tribute to Alan Turing, the subject of the film who solved the Enigma code, as he had never received recognition for his achievements while he was alive.

Moving: Graham Moore, who won the Oscar for Best Adapted Screenplay said: 'I tried to commit suicide at 16 and now I'm standing here'

The writer then said: 'I tried to commit suicide at 16 and now I'm standing here. I would like for this moment to be for that kid out there who feels like she doesn't fit in anywhere. 

'You do. Stay weird. Stay different, and then when it's your turn and you are standing on this stage please pass the same message along.' 

After the war Turing was prosecuted for homosexuality. He killed himself at the age of 41 in 1954.  

Since his death, his discovery of the code has been credited as one of the main reason's Allied forces were able to defeat Hitler's army. 

He was never recognized for his achievements while he was alive and was pardoned posthumously for his crime. 

Earlier in the evening, another reference to suicide was included in an acceptance speech when Dana Perry mentioned that her son had killed himself. 

Perry made her comments in accepting the Oscar for best documentary for 'Crisis Hotline: Veterans Press 1.'

'We should talk about suicide out loud,' she said.

Reaching out: The screenwriter urged children who felt left out: 'Stay weird. Stay different, and then when it's your turn and you are standing on this stage please pass the same message along'

According to BuzzFeed, Moore grew up on the north side of Chicago, the son of two lawyers who divorced and then married two other lawyers. 

In an interview with the site he described how he started writing at the end of college and came up the an idea for a screenplay while out drinking with his friend Ben Epstein, who was at New York University film school at the time. 

He said: 'It was one of those nights where you tell a joke, and you tell it again, and the joke gets funnier as the night goes along, even though it might never have been that funny to start with. But it was an idea for a comedy. 

'I hadn’t written fiction since a couple short stories in high school, but he was in film school so he wanted to write movies.'

Moore's debut novel, The Sherlockian, was a New York Times best seller in 2010.
