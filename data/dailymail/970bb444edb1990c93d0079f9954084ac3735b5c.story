Taxpayers had to stump up the $600,000 legal bill for a workers' compensation claim by a public servant who was injured during a motel sex romp it was revealed on Wednesday.

The infamous ‘sex-in-a-motel claim’ rumbled on for six years after the woman suffered cuts to her nose and mouth as well as ‘psychological injuries’. 

This all came about when a glass light fitting was pulled from the wall of the motel room as she had ‘vigorous’ sex with a local man in Nowra in November 2007.

Public Service Minister Eric Abetz is making changes to the federal workplace insurer aimed at cracking down on ‘rorting and malingering'

Public Service Minister Eric Abetz revealed the cost of the claim as he engineered changes to the federal workplace insurer aimed at cracking down on ‘rorting and malingering’, by Commonwealth bureaucrats.

The unidentified 'libidinous' bureaucrat eventually lost her case in the High Court but left the Commonwealth with a legal bill topping $600,000, including the costs of the bureaucrat's own lawyers and barristers.

‘The flaws in the system were highlighted in lurid terms by the infamous "hotel room sex case", where a Commonwealth public servant successfully sought workers compensation for an injury sustained on a work trip, after hours, while engaging in sexual activity,’ the minister says in The Canberra Times.

‘Thankfully the decision was ultimately overturned by the High Court, but at significant cost to the scheme, which had to pay more than $600,000 in legal costs to defend the spurious claim, including for the legal costs of the libidinous claimant.’

Legislation introduced to the Parliament on Wednesday can save federal government agencies up to $50 million in their insurance premiums each year by making sweeping reforms to the much-maligned public service compensation scheme.

Senator Abetz said that, rather than paying them to stay at home, his reforms would help turn Comcare into an insurer that helped get injured public servants back to work.
