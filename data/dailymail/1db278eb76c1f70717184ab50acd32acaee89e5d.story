This baby orangutan already seems to be getting to grips with the world as he clings to his mother at Singapore Zoo.

The playful Bornean orangutan, named Veera, appears to pull a face at the camera as his mother Dam sits down for a bite to eat.

Veera, who was born in January at the zoo - which has the largest social colony of endangered Sumatran and Bornean orangutans in the world.Â

Bornean orangutans, which are native to the island of Borneo, are an endangered 
species, due to deforestation and deliberate killing by hunters.

The species, together with the Sumatran orangutan, belongs to the only genus of great apes native to Asia.

Orangutans are very intelligent animals, and can use tools. They share around 97 per cent of their DNA with humans.

Bornean orangutans live in tropical and subtropical forests in lowland and mountainous areas of Borneo. The species lives in the tree canopy and moves large distances in search of food.

Around 55,000 Bornean orangutans live in the wild. As well as the destruction of their natural habitat, they are also killed for the 'bushmeat trade,' while young orangutans are even caught to be sold as pets.
