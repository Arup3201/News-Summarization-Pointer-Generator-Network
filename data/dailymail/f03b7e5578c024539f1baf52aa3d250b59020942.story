Detectives in the great Wollongong CCTV camera heist have a prime lead in the their investigation - an image of a man caught by the CCTV camera in the act of removing it from a photographic studio this week.

Too busy stealing the camera to disguise his face - or to even remove the cigarette in his mouth - the man is dressed in a light-coloured cap and dark hoodie and captured with his arms stretched out to the camera he is stealing.

The ultimate caught in the act photograph - which could be termed a 'shelfie' because with the camera's aid he is shelfing himself, or giving himself up - was taken by the camera inside Cole Studios  in West Wollongong, 80km south of Sydney, from where two cameras were stolen.

Some mothers do 'ave 'em: CCTV thief, cigarette in mouth, captured in the act of stealing a CCTV camera by the very camera he is pulling off the wall of a photography studio in Wollongong, south of Sydney

It is being widely shared on Facebook along with witty remarks about the thief, who was also filmed wheeling up his bicycle to the camera to commit the burglary.

'Quick, going to steal a camera better slip the hoodie on so no one sees me ....stares right on into the camera for a close up shot ..... Some mothers do have them,' wrote Nicole Abrahams after officers from Wollongong Local Area Command posted the image.

'Please find him, arrest him and take away his ability to reproduce,' posted Rob Fletcher. And from 

 Leanne Hunter-Knight: 'But first, let me take a selfie!' 

The ultimate 'shelfie': Social media posters on Facebook have been quick to take the mickey out of the apparently oblivious thief who has 'shelfed' himself (dobbed himself in) with the aid of the camera he is stealing

Wollongong detectives know exactly what time the robbery took place, at 4.36am and five seconds last Sunday, recorded and time stamped on the footage.

'This video MUST be sent to some form of 'world's dumbest criminals' TV show,' wrote Dawso Dawson, whereas Warren Spriggs said 'He should have just worn a name tag. No mistaking that head',

According to Jason Cole, who owns the  photography studio where the robbery took place, the CCTV footage shows the thief may have thought he had got away scot free because CCTV footage just cuts out when he manages to disconnect the camera from the wall.

Mr Cole said the cameras were worth  just $90 each, Fairfax reports.

Police say the Facebook post is proving popular and anyone with information about the man's identity should contact Crime Stoppers on 1800333000.

Not everyone is sure of the man's guilt.

Rachel Keen Lidden posted on the Wollongong Police Facebook page,  'he may not have stolen [it]. May have just been tampering with it minutes before someone else stole it. I'm sure there is a lawyer out there somewhere who would argue that lesser charge. Not that I'm saying he is guilty of anything other than stupidity'

Jenny Mitchelson wrote, 'Right, Rachel! He could been cleaning a spot or using it to see his reflection!'.
