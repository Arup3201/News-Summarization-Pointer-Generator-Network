The couple accused of keeping three women as slaves for 30 years ran a Maoist sect in the 1970s that recruited young female foreign students.

Aravindan Balakrishnan and his wife Chanda were said to have put their followers under a ‘spell’.

The pair were arrested last week after three women, who had allegedly suffered years of abuse, were rescued from a flat in Brixton.

They called him Comrade Bala and their revolutionary cry was ‘Death to the British fascist state!’

Their base was a converted bookshop in Brixton, South London, where he and his followers would spread their Leftist poison and hatch plots against the Establishment.

The Communist sect that Comrade Bala and his wife Comrade Chanda ran was called The Workers’ Institute of Marxism-Leninism-Mao Tsetung Thought, an obscure political faction formed in the 1970s.

Only a handful of people ever belonged to it – but the band of like-minded activists and fanatics proudly proclaimed the world would soon be liberated from capitalist oppression by the Chinese People’s Liberation Army.

If it sounds like an episode of the classic TV series Citizen Smith, in which Robert Lindsay played the leader of the Tooting Popular Front, it is not a coincidence.

Bala’s group was the inspiration for the comedy series that featured Wolfie Smith and his Marxist dream, penned by the writer of Only Fools and Horses and screened for three years from 1977.

Reality, however, may have been far more sinister.

For Comrade Bala and his wife Comrade Chanda are currently at the centre of police investigations into allegations that three women had been held captive as slaves for the last 30 years.

Bala – a short, bald 73-year-old called Aravindan Balakrishnan, and his 67-year-old wife Chanda, apparently known as ‘Mrs Busy Bee’, were arrested last week after it was alleged the women suffered years of physical and mental abuse at the couple’s succession of addresses around Brixton.

A 57-year-old Irish woman and a 69-year-old Malaysian woman were said to have suffered years of ‘physical and mental abuse’.

Another, Rosie, 30, was adopted as a baby by the couple after her real parents died in a fire.

This site in Brixton was once the headquarters of the Mao Zedong Memorial Centre - which housed a communist collective run by the slavery case suspects - reportedly Aravindan Balakrishnan, 73, and his wife Chanda, 67

It emerged at the weekend she had been sending love letters to her neighbour, Marius Feneck, 26, describing her suffering and despair at being held captive in the Brixton council flat for more than 30 years.

Bala and Chanda have now been bailed but are currently unable to return to their home.

The pair, of Indian and Tanzanian origin, came to Britain in the 1960s.

The Maoist inspired ‘collective’ they ran in the 1970s is understood now to be under investigation to establish any bearing it might have on the current case.

The sect's idol - China's Chairman Mao

It was formed in 1974 after Bala, who studied economics and became deeply immersed in radical politics, broke away from an English branch of the Communist Party to form his ultra-Left group.

The executive threw him out for ‘conspiratorial activities’, according to a party report at the time. His faction members had ‘attempted to put themselves above the discipline of the party’.

The so-called Workers’ Institute he went on to create was based at the Mao Zedong Memorial Centre in Acre Lane, Brixton, a bookshop that is now an (unconnected) Algerian restaurant.

The centre, named in memory of ‘our beloved chairman’, operated as a commune, reportedly with 13 of its 25 members living there.

At least six were engaged in what was described as full-time revolutionary work.

The centre had its own library and published a weekly journal, The South London Workers’ Bulletin.

The group is said to have encouraged women to take a leading role in political organisation and structure.

Described as a ‘guru’, Bala was clearly a powerful figure at the head of a band of devoted female followers effectively under his spell, or at least in his awe.

Many were persuaded to give up their studies in order to ‘integrate with the working class’ and carry out ‘revolutionary work’.

By day the centre was the group’s administrative head office.

Most evenings the Institute ran lecture sessions and political film presentations.

Bala would educate followers in his politics and tell them regularly what was wrong with the capitalist society of his adopted country.

Printed leaflets called for the working classes to unite to bring down capitalism in Britain.

Such were the bizarre outpourings of what was labelled a ‘lunatic fringe’ that The Times – viewed by the group as the Establishment tool of the bourgeoisie – reprinted some of its material in waspish diary items.

Had the newspaper not done so, perhaps, the commune might never have come to public attention.

But it was already under scrutiny by Scotland Yard and MI5 – and shortly after dawn on March 22, 1978, police swooped on the Institute to make 14 arrests, among them Comrades Bala and Chanda.

Critics branded it the oppression of the fascist police state, and complained that some of the 200 officers with dogs and riot shields had assaulted the occupants and racially abused them.

The centre was subsequently shut down, the organisation went underground and of course, the Chinese People’s Liberation Army never invaded.

It is understood some of the women who were part of the original commune later moved with the couple to various addresses in South London.

However, the sect may have helped to spread the message.

A year before Bala formalised his organisation – at a time when he was already plotting his breakaway movement – extremists who identified themselves as a Marxist-Leninist-Maoist group stormed a London School of Economics lecture and attacked the speaker.

Professor Hans Eysenck, author of a controversial paperback entitled ‘Race, Intelligence and Education’ was punched and bundled off the stage by around 20 people, some of whom snatched the microphone and gave a lecture instead on the evils of fascism.

It is not clear whether the 20 were connected to Bala – but it was perhaps an indication of the ideals held by those who shared his views.

A speech he later delivered gives a flavour. He talks about ‘upholding the revolutionary traditions of our martyrs’ to ‘defeat revisionism and counter the attacks of the British fascist state’.

He added: ‘Dare to think, dare to speak, dare to act. It is right to rebel against reactionaries. Only thus can you be genuine soldiers of beloved Chairman Mao and undertake revolutionary work which has never been done before.’

Oxford University professor Steve Rayner described the Brixton sect yesterday as ‘a tiny, very tight knit group’ that was ‘clearly under the spell’ of Comrade Bala.

In his research for a 1979 thesis, Professor Rayner said Bala was able to exercise control by ‘his superior ability to manipulate the oracles’, disciplining those who challenged his power.

His group of mainly young overseas female students – including two from Malaysia, four from China, one from the West Indies and three Europeans – seemed to have ‘difficulty adjusting to life in the UK’ and maintained a ‘hostile attitude’ towards the Establishment.

He said the group’s ideology was ‘profoundly detached from reality’ – a description, perhaps, that might easily have been applied to Citizen Smith and his ‘power to the people’ plans for Tooting.

But there was an important difference. Bala’s group was scathing of ‘so-called revolutionaries who spend their time talking in pubs’ – which is precisely what Wolfie Smith did.

And its ambition to bring ‘death to the British fascist state’ was fact, not fiction.

Sorry we are unable to accept comments for legal reasons.
