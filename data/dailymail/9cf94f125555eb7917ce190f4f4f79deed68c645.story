A Sydney councillor is pushing for the drug 'ice' to be legalised, claiming it will be safer for those that use it.

Manly councillor Hugh Burns would like to see local GPs prescribe the potent drug, which is a type of meth-amphetamine, to 'confirmed drug addicts' because he believes it would be much safer than getting it off the streets.

'I think it would be safer to have a branded product with a standard dose even if it's morally repugnant,' he told the Manly Daily.

But for those who have been affected by the deadly drug, they consider Mr Burns' plans to be ridiculous, saying the drug is banned for a reason, because it is dangerous.

Tony Wood lost his daughter Anna after she took an ecstasy tablet in 1995 and he has labelled the idea 'insane'. 

'Horrible drug that's destroyed so many young lives,' he said.

Mr Burns was also scorned by a fellow councillor and policeman Alan Le Surf who said the drug is 'like crack' and a 'slow way to die'.

Drug experts also weren't quick to warm to the idea, Rebecca McKetin, a researcher at ANU in Canberra said ice' users would still face health problems, without the risk of organised crime.

Although Dr. Alex Wodak at St Vincent's hospital entertained the idea of debating the legislation of the drug, although favours controlled laws on less-powerful drugs.
