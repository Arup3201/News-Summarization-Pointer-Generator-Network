Tiffany Maydew, 40, is accused of having sex numerous times with a 15-year-old boy, who was friends with her daughter

A mother is accused of having sex with a 15-year-old friend of her daughter.

Police arrested Tiffany Maydew, 40, after high school officers were passed information about the alleged relationship with the teenage boy.Â 

Maydew, from Troutdale, Oregon, faces third-degree rape, sodomy and sex abuse charges.

Investigators accuse Maydew of having sex with the boy throughout the city, according to KPTV.

The age of consent in the state is 18 years old.

The
allegations were made when staff from the Department of Human Services 
contacted a Sam Barlow High School resource officer from the Gresham 
Police Department.

When the teenager was contacted by the officer, he initially refused to discuss the allegations.

The boy's mother was then contacted.

Police told KPTV that he then admitted having sex with his friend's mother in her car and at his home.

Maydew was arrested on Wednesday and later released.

Local media report that the boy admitted having sex with Maydew at various locations in Troutdale, pictured
