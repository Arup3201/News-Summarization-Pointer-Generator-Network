Broadcast television will die off within the next 16 years, the CEO of Netflix has said.

Reed Hastings, whose streaming media firm boasts more than 53million users, declared that the continuous rise of on-demand content will cause traditional TV to become obsolete by 2030.

Speaking at an industry event in Mexico City, he said: 'It’s kind of like the horse, you know, the horse was good until we had the car. The age of broadcast TV will probably last until 2030.'

Prediction: Broadcast television will die off by 2030, the CEO of Netflix, Reed Hastings (pictured), has claimed

With its impressive audience, rapid growth and exclusive content such as Orange Is The New Black, Netflix continues to transform how consumers watch TV shows and movies. 

And with  TV viewership having dropped  50 per cent between 2002 and 2012, according to the Observer, Mr Hasting's prediction could end up being correct. 

The businessman, who has an estimated net worth of $860million, was appearing at the event to discuss Nielsen's plans to start measuring Netflix's viewership next month - a novel proposal.

But downplaying the significance of the plans - which will not include the measurement of content on mobile devices, he told The Hollywood Reporter: 'It's not very relevant.

'There's so much viewing that happens on a mobile phone or an iPad that [Nielsen won't] capture.'

He added that the company was growing rapidly in Latin America, saying: 'It is one of the fastest growth areas in the world in terms of broadband households and Internet connectivity.'

Earlier this year, Netflix, which will also shortly become available in Australia and New Zealand, announced plans to disrupt how movies make their official debut.

In a move which 'breaks the stranglehold that movie theaters have' on film releases, it will debut the sequel to 'Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon' on the same day as it hits IMAX theaters.

To keep up with its progression and production of exclusive content, Netflix, co-founded by Mr Hastings and Marc Randolph in 1997, also announced a price hike for new customers in May.

The increase of $1  a month raised the cost of a subscription to $8.99 per month.
