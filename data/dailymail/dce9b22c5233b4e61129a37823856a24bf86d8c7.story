Drug mules Melissa Reid and Michaella 
McCollum Connolly suffered a dramatic setback tonight to their hopes of 
an early return to Britain.

The pair had been expecting to be sentenced next Tuesday after pleading guilty to drugs trafficking.

But
 the case took a dramatic twist last night after prosecutors said they 
wanted more information from the women about the drugs gang that sent 
them to Peru to pick up £1.5million of cocaine.

Accused: Melissa Reid, right, and Michaella McCollum were yesterday escorted from a truck by police at Sarita Colonia prison ahead of their court appearance

Police escort: The pair were handcuffed as they were taken from Virgen de Fatima Prison on the outskirts of the capital, to a court in the city centre wearing their own clothes

Behind bars: After the pair arrived at the court, they were detained in a holding cell, surrounded by guards, as they awaited their appearance in front of a judge

Instead of being sentenced next week, the women are now expected to be asked to make new statements in court.

Prosecutors
 said they would be submitting a formal request on Friday to the court 
for the new statements to be taken - and insisted Reid and Connoly could not benefit from a sentence reduction without their agreement.

The
 pair decided to plead guilty yesterday after weeks of protesting their 
innocence so they could benefit from an early termination procedure 
under Peruvian law - guaranteeing them an eighth off the minimum eight 
year prison sentence for drugs trafficking.

Court officials were still claiming today the women would be sentenced next week.

But
 Juan Mendoza Abarca, head of the anti-drugs state prosecutor's office 
which is prosecuting the women, said: ‘What the girls have said so far 
is not enough.

‘We want to 
get to the men behind them and we want more information off them to do 
that. It's not enough to say you've killed someone and not say how or 
why.

‘All these girls have 
said is “We're guilty” and very little else. They've given a four-line 
statement to the court which doesn't help us track down the gang that 
sent them to Peru in the first place.

‘For
 the women to benefit from the early termination procedure and receive a
 reduced prison sentence, all sides including state prosecutors have to 
be in agreement.

‘As things 
stand at the moment with the information the women have given the court,
 we don't agree to them benefitting from the early termination 
procedure.

Home clothes: Melissa Reid, right, and McCollum Connolly both wore black leggings as they were escorted from a truck by police at Sarita Colonia prison in Callao, Peru

‘We are writing 
to the court to demand the women give new and fuller evidence in another
 court hearing. It's not an appeal and it's not something the judge has 
any control over.

‘All he has control over is the date of the new hearing. What I can say for sure is there will be no sentencing next Tuesday.

‘It's
 likely now that what will take place Tuesday will be the hearing where 
the women will be asked to expand on the court statements they've 
already made.’

The 
prosecution demand will put back the women’s hopes of starting their 
jail sentences as soon as possible so they can get back to their 
families in Britain.

Without
 agreement on all sides on the early termination process, they will have
 to stand trial and face between eight and 15 years in jail if 
convicted.

Prosecutors said 
before the women made their dramatic guilty plea yesterday they did not 
believe their claims they had been forced into trying to smuggle drugs 
by armed Colombian mafia.

The women claimed they had been kidnapped by criminals in Ibiza where they had been working over the summer.

Reid,
 from Lenzie near Edinburgh and Connoly, from Dungannon, Co Tyrone, 
both 20, were arrested at Lima's Jorge Chavez airport on August 6 as 
they tried to fly to Spain with more than 11 kilos of cocaine in their 
suitcases.

They are being 
held on remand at Virgen de Fatima women's prison in Lima. It is thought
 they are unaware of the latest setback to their case.
