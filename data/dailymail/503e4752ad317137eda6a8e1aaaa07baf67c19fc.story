Ruth Madoff has said that she blames herself for her son Mark's suicide.

Mark Madoff hanged himself with a dog leash on the second anniversary of his father Bernie Madoff's arrest for running the biggest financial fraud in history. He had wanted his mother to cut off all contact with his father.

Speaking for the first time since her disgraced financier husband's sensational arrest three years ago, Ruth Madoff now says she wishes she had severed ties with her husband as Mark wanted.

Guilt: Ruth Madoff has said that she blames herself for her son Marks' suicide.

Previously she was reported to have held Bernie, now serving a 150-year prison 
sentence for his record-breaking scam, responsible for her son's death.

In an interview with CBS broadcast tonight, Ruth said: 'I just wish, until my dying day, that I had done what he wanted.

'I don't know if it would have made a difference or not, but if I could change things, at least if I had tried, I would have felt a little better. I don't know if it would have mattered.

She added: 'It's the most awful thing that can happen to anybody- the suicide of a child.'

The Madoffs' other son, Andrew, also appears in the interview with '60 Minutes' 

Disgraced: Bernie Madoff is serving a 150-year prison sentence

Ruth and her sons barely spoke in the two years after his father's arrest because, Andrew Madoff said, he and his brother could not understand her decision to stay by their father's side.

'I never thought of leaving,' Ruth Madoff said. 'I didn't know what else to do but stay there.'

'I think he got stuck, that's what he said. And he didn't have the courage to face things when they might have been able to be faced on a much smaller scale,' she said.

After Mark killed himself in his Soho loft, aged 46, Ruth Madoff cut off contact with her husband and now lives in a three-room apartment in South Florida.

That decision led to a reconciliation with her other son Andrew.

When the interviewer asked why she hadn't filed for divorce, she said: 'It doesn't matter to me -- he's going to die in prison.'

The devastated mother claims she 
understood Mark's decision, as the family fell spectacularly from grace,
'going through those agonies of shame.'

In
a segment of the interview revealed earlier this week Ruth claimed that
she and Bernie themselves attempted suicide on Christmas Eve.

Despite taking all the sleeping pills they had in the house (Bernie took more she said) the couple simply woke up the next day.

Describing the decision in tonight's programme, she claimed it hadn't been a difficult one. But ultimately she said she was glad the couple woke up the next day none the worse.

Meanwhile Madoff has cast some doubt on this story by denying from his prison cell that he ever attempted suicide.

Anger: Andrew Madoff said he had also been angered by his mother Ruth's decision to stand by his father Bernie Madoff

In tonight's interview, Ruth broke 
down as she looked at a picture of her two sons with their father in 
what she called 'happier times'.

The programme is being aired the night before 
'Truth and Consequences: Life Inside the Madoff Family', the latest 
tell-all on the infamous saga goes on sale.

The account is written by author Laurie Sandell, 
who says she was approached by Andrew Madoff and his fiancee, Catherine Hooper, 
to write about the family's painful experience.

The book also showcases never-seen-before family pictures of the Madoffs.

Younger son Andrew also used the programme to speak out about his brother's suicide.

Childhood: In the interview Ruth Madoff broke down as she looked at a picture of her two sons in what she called 'happier times'.

Describing Mark's final months he said: 'I had tried to talk to him, to understand what he was going through.

'It was very painful for me and very difficult for me, but I was making it through.To see him struggling and not making it was terrible.

'We were very close. He was my best friend. And I wanted to help him.

The other Madoffs have always claimed to have known nothing about Bernie's Ponzi scheme.

But defrauded Madoff investors have 
long viewed the convicted swindler's sons, wife and other family member 
suspiciously, arguing it is impossible that they did not know about his 
lies. No family members have been criminally charged.

The Madoffs used tonight's interview to reiterate that position.

'I
can't explain it, I mean I trusted him,' Ruth Madoff said when asked 
how she could not have known of her husband's crime. 'Why would it ever 
occur to me that it wasn't legal?'

Brothers: Andrew Madoff told CBS that he wanted to help his brother Mark and hated seeing him unable to cope with the family crisis

'There was nothing that would ever make me suspect anything,' she said.

In
tonight's broadcast Andrew claimed his mother Ruth's first question 
when her husband confessed, sobbing, to the massive fraud was 'What's a 
Ponzi scheme?'

'She didn't 
even understand that. I think it was me who answered and said that 'It 
means that it's all fake,'' Andrew Madoff said. '(My father) followed 
that up and said 'Yes, I've been lying to all of you - all of these 
years. I've been lying to everybody. I've been lying to myself.''

Madoff's
younger son said his father's investment advisory business, the Ponzi 
scheme, was 'a completely separate business' to the trading business 
where he and his brother worked.

'We
were executing hundreds of thousands of transactions a day. And that 
kept all of us incredibly busy. And it just -- it just didn't occur to 
me that he could be involved in any kind of criminal activity,' he said.

Letdown: Andrew Madoff said one of the hardest things for him to come to terms with was the feeling that he and his brother were used by his father, who shielded his Ponzi scheme with their legitimate trading business.

One of the hardest things for Andrew to come to terms with was the feeling that he and his brother were used by his father, who shielded his Ponzi scheme with their legitimate trading business.

'It's unforgivable,' he said. 'No father should do that to their sons.'

'What he did to me, to my brother, and to my family is unforgivable,' Andrew Madoff said. 'What he did to thousands of other people, destroyed their lives -- I'll never understand it. And I'll never forgive him for it.'

The interview coincides with a series of interviews by Mark's widow Stephanie Madoff Mack, who earlier this month released her own damning account of the family, The End Of Normal: A Wife's Anguish, A Widow's New Life.
