The wife of a disabled Afghanistan veteran who was injured while searching for Sgt. Bowe Bergdahl has posted a scathing message against him this week, adding a personal account to the rising protests against the negotiations with the Taliban that lead to Bergdahl's freedom.

In a message she posted via Facebook, Shannon Allen, wife of Sgt. 1st Class Mark Allen, wrote 'Meet my husband, injuries directly brought to
 you by the actions of this traitor.  He can't give an account of what 
went down, because he can no longer speak. Now, which guy is a "hero" 
again?!? Sick.'

In addition to the message, Allen posted a family picture, showing husband and wife in addition to their daughter. Mark Allen was posed in his wheelchair wearing his dress blues, while their daughter was wearing a graduation cap and gown.

Mark Allen, who is from Loganville, Georgia, was injured when a sniper bullet pierced the armor in his helmet in Kabul, Afghanistan. The bullet entered through his frontal lobe, rendering him paralyzed.

The injury occurred only one month after he arrived to Afghanistan.

Shannon Allen's comments add to the growing surge of public outcry over the circumstances surrounding Bergdahl's capture by Taliban forces, as well as his release.

Five Taliban fighters were let out of detention in Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, in exchange for Bergdahl's freedom last week.

According to critics, Bergdahl deserted his post at a U.S. Army base in the Paktika province of Afghanistan on June 30, 2009. Soliders that served at the same time and were deployed to search for him accuse him of deserting the U.S. Military that night.

'We all served together and we were all in it together over there and he
 broke that bond by leaving us,' Army Sgt. Josh Korder said on the Today Show on June 3.

The outcry is also gathering online. The Facebook group 'Bowe Bergdahl is a Traitor' currently has over 69,000 likes. The banner on the top of the page shows the pictures of six soliders who died while searching for Bergdahl.

The Facebook page posted Shannon Allen's message, which received nearly 60,000 likes and more than 5,000 comments.

Bergdahl is currently in Germany, where he is recovering from the five-year ordeal. According to the family's pastor, his parents Bob and Jani Bergdahl have yet to speak to their son.
