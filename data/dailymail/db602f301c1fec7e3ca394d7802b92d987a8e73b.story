A fiercely loyal dog was found in the searing Oklahoma heat Saturday steadfastly refusing to leave the side of his deceased owner.

Animal control officers in Oklahoma City were called to the scene as the bull terrier fought hard to stay in the 100 degree Fahrenheit heat.

Now at the local shelter, the dog's defiance has turned to sorrow as he displays behaviors strongly associated with mourning: he refuses to eat, to drink or even lift his head.

Loyal: Oklahoma City officials are seen here struggling to get a fiercely loyal bull terrier away from his deceased owner in the searing summer heat

Sad: Even with temperatures nearing 100F, the dog stayed with his dead owner and fought hard to stay with him as officials dragged him away

'The dog kept wanting to pull back to go back to where the remains of where the deceased owner was,' Oklahoma City Animal Shelter supervisor Sheridan Lowery told KFOR.

Officials said the dog had remained at the body of his likely transient owner, who died from natural causes, despite having every opportunity to go find water and shelter from the relentless sun.

After authorities arrived and eventually pried the pooch away, he was taken to the animal shelter, where he remained Monday.

Mourning: The pooch is now exhibiting classic signs of grief: he won't eat, sleep or even lift his head

'Their owner is deceased. They don¿t know what is going on. They don¿t know how to act. They don¿t know how to react,' said Oklahoma City Animal shelter supervisor Sheridan Lowery

Footage of the dog shows him unable at times to even muster the will to lift his head.

They're the classic signs of grief, from which even dogs can suffer.

'Their owner is deceased. They don’t know what is going on. They don’t know how to act. They don’t know how to react,' said Lowery.

The pup will hopefully next be placed with a family that can help lift his broken spirit.

'If he’s shown this kind of attachment, this kind of dedication to family he could make a really good family pet,' says Lowery.

Looking up? The dog will hopefully soon find a new family if officials fail to find any living relatives of the deceased owner
