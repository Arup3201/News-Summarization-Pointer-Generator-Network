He's seen his daughter transformed from an outgoing movie star into a troubled young woman feared to be suffering from a severe mental illness.

And the concern was etched on the face of Amanda Bynes' father Rick as he stood outside a Los Angeles court house on Friday.

His anxious appearance came as papers filed at the court revealed shocking new details of the extent of his daughter's apparent mental illness.

Amongst
the examples given of Amanda's disturbed state include the fact that she 
hailed a taxi cab in New York in order to visit LA - a 
journey of some 2,778 miles.

Anxious: Concern shows on the face of Rick Bynes ahead of his court appearance to talk about the future of his daughter Amanda in LA on Thursday morning

The
details come from papers filed in support of Amanda's mother Lynn's 
application for conservatorship of her daughter's affairs - both 
personal and financial.

The 
cab journey is just one case of financial extravagance from the starlet -
who is said to have burned through $1.4m of her $4m fortune in just a 
few months.

The papers state that Amanda withdrew $100,000 on June 4, then the same 
amount on July 2.

She has also written checks for a total of $63,000 during the same period.

Her parents state 
they believe a substantial amount was spent on illegal drugs.

'We have received large doctor bills for purported services to Amanda from doctors that we do not know for unspecified services,' they say in the filing, reports the New York Daily News.

'We are informed and believe that a substantial amount of this money is being used to pay for marijuana.'

Concerned: The Bynes family head to court to discuss the future of their troubled daughter

The papers also state that  Amanda has become 'extremely paranoid about being watched,' and covers smoke alarms with towels and tapes windows shut to prevent herself being photographed.

Her parents also claim that she has 'profound issues with her body image' and is 'obsessed with the fact that she (and others) are ugly,' according to TMZ.

While her parents case may seem compelling, the judge decided there was no need to rush the application, as 
Amanda is currently undergoing psychiatric treatment in a medical centre
under involuntary hold.

Judge Glen Reiser said: 'This is not a case where there's an emergency right now, and because conservatorships of the person and estate involve liberty and property interests, there are a lot of t's we need to cross and i's we need to dot.'

Before ruling on the application Judge Reiser set a number of requirements which must be met at a full hearing on August 9.

Among other things he wants to speak to Amanda and to the doctors treating her.

He also wishes to see the police file on the recent incident in which she started a fire on a stranger's driveway, and for her court-appointed lawyer to offer a recommendation.

However
the judge said if Bynes is released before the end of her current two-week 
hold, either side could ask for an emergency hearing.

Meanwhile Amanda herself is expected to attend a hearing at her treatment facility in a bid to have her enforced treatment ended after it was extended from 72-hours to two weeks on Thursday.

While Bynes had her own lawyer argued the extension should be denied, doctors insisted they needed two weeks to properly diagnose her condition.

They felt that releasing her could pose a danger to herself and others.

It had earlier been claimed doctors had made an initial assessment that the actress is suffering from 
'schizophrenic tendencies.'

Bynes, 27, was admitted to the psychiatric centre following an incident where she allegedly started a fire in an elderly woman's driveway - an incident referred to in the request for conservatorship.

According to reports, Bynes can act normally for up to ten hours at a time, but then becomes irrational and incoherent.

Despite her strange behaviour Bynes has reportedly tested negative for all illegal drugs except marijuana.

With the former Hairspray star receiving treatment, friends have started to come forward to offer more details about her recent troubles.

These include the allegation by her close friend Ana Rivera that Amanda's last dog died due to her neglect.

'Her last Pomeranian... she left just wander away and it fell off the cliffs in Hollywood Hills,' Rivera told Radar. 'She told me about it and started crying when talking about it.'

Rivera, who revealed text messages from Amanda, also talked about her habit of smoking marijuana.

'She would smoke five [joints] in an hour,' Rivera said. 'One time she had me roll ten joints and then smoked them all at once.'

And
distubingly she also shared text messages with the wesbite in which 
Amanda claimed she had been given the date rape drug GHB by a man.

'She
thought he was giving her coke, but when she sniffed it, it made her 
feel like she was dying, and ended up in hospital,' Rivera explained. 'I
was like you can’t see that guy again.'
