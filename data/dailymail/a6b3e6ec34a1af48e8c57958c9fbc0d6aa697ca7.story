An online video game allowing players to become Australian Prime Minister Tony Abbott and 'stop the boats' has gone viral on social media.

'Stop the Boats' the game lets players try their hand at preventing refugee boats from landing on Australian shores - as a Tony Abbott head bobbing in the water.

The mission? To keep as many vessels from the mainland as possible, while avoiding obstacles like politician Clive Palmer's Titanic and former One National leader Pauline Hanson 'at all costs'.

The satirical game, set to Nintendo's Super Mario Brothers theme song, takes aim at the Coalition's divisive asylum seeker policy by greeting players with the teaser:

'Oh no! Australia's refugee intake per capita is 68th in the world! Help Tony stop the boats and win over voter approval!'

Gamers can also use their keyboards to 'Teleport Tony', 'Excercise humility with those $12 Billion F-35 jets, Straya'  or to help Australian Treasurer Joe Hockey  buy cigars.

'Stop the Boats' creator, Fraser Hemphill, said he was surprised to see the game received 100,000 hits within its first 36 hours online.

'It's gotten a lot bigger than I would ever have expected,' said Fraser. 'I needed to learn the language that the game's written in and I thought it would be a fun way to learn - but really, it was just a way of procrastinating for me and Facebook blew it up.'

He said the game had clocked more than 1 million plays as of last night.

Online gamers have called 'Stop the Boats' highly addictive, with one player saying it  'perfectly hits so-bad-it’s-good territory.'

If too many refugees make it to Australia, it's game over.  But winners who bat each boat offshore become 'the Suppository of all wisdom', a reference to a gaffe made by Mr Abbott at a Liberal Party meeting last year when he told the room:

'No one, however smart, however well educated, however experienced, is the suppository of all wisdom.'

The Abbott  government's 'stop the boats' asylum seeker policy, a key pre-election pledge, has been  condemned by the Australian Greens, non-governmental organisations and the United Nations as a breach of the Refugee Convention and human rights.

Gamers are challenged to avoid obstacles like politician Clive Palmer in his Titanic and to collect revenue to help Treasurer Joe Hockey buy more cigars
