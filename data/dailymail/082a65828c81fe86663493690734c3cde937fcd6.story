The University of New Mexico says a psychology professor's tweet that people battling obesity don't have the willpower to finish a doctorate degree wasn't part of any research project as he had previously claimed.

The school's institutional review board found that Geoffrey Miller's tweet was instead 'self-promotional'.

Miller posted on Twitter last month that obese doctoral applicants who don't 'have the will power to stop eating carbs' won't 'have the willpower to do a dissertation'.

Academic slip-up: Visiting NYU professor Geoffrey Miller caused outrage when he tweeted this message last month

The tweet has since been deleted and 
his Twitter account been made private. Miller later apologized and said 
the tweet was part of a research project.

Miller is on leave from UNM while serving as a visiting professor at New York University.

UNM officials say the school is conducting a disciplinary investigation.

Geoffrey Miller, who specializes in evolutionary psychology, tweeted on June 2: 'Dear obese PhD applicants: If you don't 
have the willpower to stop eating carbs, you won't have the willpower to
 do a dissertation. #truth.'

It is understood that he will keep his job as a visiting professor at NYU's Stern School of Business.

Crass: The professor, who has tenure at the University of New Mexico, quickly apologized for his remarks

Professor Miller quickly deleted the message after a 
backlash from students and professors alike.

Jay Rosen, who teaches journalism at the New York school, wrote: 'Astonishing fat-shaming tweet, since deleted, from an academic, @matingmind. The mind boggles.'

Miller's transgression brought into question the academic's impartiality when it came to picking students for highly competitive PhD programs.

Dr Jason DeCaro, a former PhD student who is now a biological anthropologist in Alabama, tweeted: 'Dear rejected UNM psychology applicants: save now-deleted tweet for potential lawsuit. Jerk.'

Miller posted a hasty apology: 'My sincere apologies to all for that idiotic, impulsive, and badly judged tweet. It does not reflect my true views, values, or standards.'

Outrage: Fellow academics and former PhD students including Dr Jason DeCaro in Alabama posted angry responses to Professor Miller

It was quickly followed by the 
remark: 'Obviously my previous tweet does not represent the selection 
policies of any university, or my own selection.'

MailOnline received no response last month from Professor Miller as to what criteria he uses to select PhD students  - and was awaiting a response on UNM's statement today. 

Miller, who is a tenured professor at the University of New Mexico, has joined NYU's Stern School of Business for eight months until this August.

He has been published in a wide range of international academic publications and conducted research at the London School of Economics, the Max Planck Institute for Psychological Research in Munich, Germany and UCLA.

All apologies: The academic quickly retracted his offensive remark on June 2
