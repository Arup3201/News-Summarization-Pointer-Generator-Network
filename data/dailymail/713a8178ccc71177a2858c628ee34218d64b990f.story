You would be forgiven for thinking nobody could have walked away from this horrific crash.

But 21-year-old Ashley Locker only suffered a broken arm and cuts and bruises after his silver MG ZR car ended up wrapped around a tree last Thursday morning in Scarborough, North Yorkshire.

The force of the impact meant Mr Locker was catapulted into the back of the car, still strapped in to his seat. But at 6ft 3in tall and weighing 18st, rescuers said his bulk was one reason he survived.

It was feared that both of his arms were broken and he may have suffered neck and spinal injuries, but his family said he escaped with only one broken arm, a wounded foot and cuts and bruises.

His mother, Gill, 48, said: ‘He broke his right arm in two places and has had plates and screws put in. He also had an open wound on his foot which needed 11 stitches.

‘But other than that it was just cuts and bruises. He was very lucky. The fire service cut him out. The air ambulance was on stand-by in case he had internal injuries.

'He was not trapped for very long. The front seat snapped in half and he was flung into the back seat. He still had his seatbelt on. He is a big strong lad and the ambulance woman said that helped too. He is 6ft 3in and 17 or 18st.

'We did not know anything at first. We just knew he had been taken to hospital. We felt sick when we saw the pictures of the car. We just thought he was very lucky. He is just happy he is still here.’

The accident happened just after 7:15am on Thursday on Cross Lane - a couple of miles from the home of Mr Locker, who has two sisters and has been driving for around two years.

He was released from hospital on Friday night and is recovering at home. ‘It's a big thank you to the emergency services,’ his mother added. ‘We are just so relieved and thankful.’

Mr Locker was still not up to speaking about his ordeal, but said on Facebook, on which he listed himself as working for Scarborough-based McCain Foods: ‘Think I have to be one of - if not the luckiest person alive. Thanks for all the messages and sorry to all you that worried.’
