Kensington strangler: Serial killer Antonio Rodriguez will serve three consecutive life sentences for the murders of three women in Philadelphia, U.S. in 2010

A man dubbed the 'Kensington strangler' will serve three life sentences after being convicted of raping and killing three women.

Antonio Rodriguez, 23, who has a history of mental illness, strangled three prostitutes during sex in what a judge described as 'a horrific case'.

The spate of grisly murders gripped Kensington, Philadelphia, U.S. in late 2010.

'This is just a horrific case,' Common Pleas Judge Jeffrey Minehart said after finding Rodriguez guilty of three counts of first degree murder.

'You not only violated these young women while they were living, but you violated them when they were dead.'

Rodriguez killed Elaine Goldberg, 21, Casey Mahoney, 27 and Nicole Piacentini, 35, during November and December 2010.

The killer said in statements following his arrest in January 2011 that he had met his victims, who were working as prostitutes, while walking the streets of Kensington. He had sex with them in secluded areas where the murders took place.

Leo Michael Keller, the stepfather of Nicole Piacentini - a mother of four - was quoted in the Philadelphia Inquirer as saying: 'When these things occur, it just questions humanity. Why do people do these types of things?

'It's a terrible thing.'

Joseph Goldberg, the father of 21-year-old victim Elaine Goldberg, said: 'It's just like a huge part of me has died. It's not fun to wake up anymore...it's a task to get through the day.'

Casey Mahoney's aunt Mary Kanzenberg said: 'It is our hope that the defendant will spend the rest of his life tortured by the isolation he will be in.'

Assistant District Attorney Carlos Vega said Rodriguez's actions were the embodiment of evil.

'He killed these young ladies not out of anger, but because of evilness, wickedness.

'With great pleasure, he killed them.'

Defence attorney William Bowe had questioned the reliability of DNA evidence and a discrepancy over when Rodriguez was taken into custody to ask that he be acquitted of all charges.

Prosecutors did not seek the death 
penalty as Rodriguez waived his right toÂ  jury and therefore - under an 
agreement reached ahead of the trial - could only face life imprisonment
without parole.
