BBC chairman Lord Patten faced renewed calls to resign yesterday after he accused a parliamentary committee of ‘shabby’ treatment when it criticised ex-director-general George Entwistle’s bumper payoff.

The Tory peer clashed with Labour MP Margaret Hodge, chairman of the Public Accounts Committee, over a report which attacked the ‘cavalier’ use of public money to give Mr Entwistle a ‘reward for failure’ after a mere 54 days in the job.

Lord Patten accused MPs of ‘taking no notice’ of 12 pages of legal advice the BBC Trust had supplied – which he said showed it would have faced a bigger payout had they not agreed the deal.

Defence: BBC Trust chairman Lord Patten has maintained that the package was a good deal for taxpayers

In a scattergun approach, he attacked MPs, the NHS and the Press, and said his hands were tied by the corporation’s lawyers.

He suggested some newspapers, naming the Daily Mail and Daily Telegraph, were overly critical of the payout although he seemed finally to accept that Mr Entwistle was the ‘wrong man’.

On Mr Entwistle’s appointment to the job of Director General, he added: ‘With the benefit of hindsight, we chose the wrong one. But we chose him from a very distinguished field.

'It was the unanimous choice of the whole of the BBC Trust.’

He defended the BBC’s approach to the Jimmy Savile scandal – saying it had acted more swiftly than the National Health Service in response to the revelations about the TV presenter’s sordid past. 

The NHS, which has received allegations from former patients at three trusts, has still to start formal inquiries into what went wrong.

Miss Hodge said the BBC chairman should accept there might be ‘different views’ about his decision to rush through a generous deal with Mr Entwistle, adding: ‘He may not be right.’

She pointed out that there had been a
culture of generous settlements to former executives, including former 
chief operating officer Caroline Thomson who received £670,000 earlier 
this year after she was passed over for the director general’s job.

‘They just don’t get it,’ she said.

Senior Labour backbencher Barry 
Sheerman said he was shocked by Lord Patten’s comments, saying the 
remarks ‘merits his resignation’.

Last month Mr Entwistle was given a 
full year’s salary – £450,000 – double what he was entitled, to ensure a
speedy resignation amid the crisis caused by Newsnight’s dropped Savile
investigation and the botched report which wrongfully linked Lord 
McAlpine to the abuse of children.

His deal also provided a year’s 
private healthcare, fees for lawyers and even £10,000 to pay for Press 
advice.

The PAC said the deal was ‘out of line both with public 
expectations and what is considered acceptable elsewhere in the public 
sector’. MPs also criticised ‘excessive’ severance payments to ten other
senior managers, including Miss Thomson.

On Radio 4’s Today programme, the BBC
chairman said: ‘You are not supposed to criticise the Public Accounts 
Committee ... in politics it is sort of the equivalent of swearing in 
church.

The Public Accounts Committee - ‘I do think the treatment we have had from them is a bit shabby.’ NHS over Savile scandal - ‘It has to be said that the BBC has moved to tackle all this more rapidly than some of the other institutions in the country – hospitals and so on....’ Press speculation that Savile report was pulled to protect tribute programmes - ‘I was quite surprised by the fact that there was newspaper after newspaper making that allegation.’ Caroline Thomson’s £670,000 payoff - ‘She negotiated her departure with the executive. It is not an issue which the trust has the responsibility of dealing with.’ Agreeing Entwistle payoff - ‘The legal advice we had was that if we fought it we would fetch up with a bigger bill.’

‘But I do think the treatment we have
had from them is a bit shabby. I do not think they have been fair 
because they did not look at our legal arguments at all.’

In a question to Commons Leader 
Andrew Lansley, Mr Sheerman said Lord Patten’s accusation of ‘shabby’ 
treatment ‘merits his resignation’.

Lord Patten said legal advice pointed
out if the BBC Trust had not made the settlement to Mr Entwistle ‘there
and then’ it would have probably ended up having to pay out for 
constructive and unfair dismissal claims.

He said he knew and liked Miss
Hodge, ‘but I don’t think this is a fair way of treating us’.

Miss Hodge told the Daily Mail 
yesterday that her committee ‘did give them a fair hearing’ and said the
BBC Trust ‘called it wrong’ by not letting the National Audit Office 
look at the deal.

‘I think they don’t understand that 
the public really do get irate when they see their licence fee being 
used on such big handouts which are rewards for failure.’

The MP said she did still not 
understand the whole package of Mr Entwistle’s deal and did not know if 
his pension was based on what he was earning for the 54 days as BBC 
chief.

She said the committee was ‘gobsmacked’ and ‘astounded’ when it 
was revealed what was in his exit package.

Lord Patten said the BBC has taken 
legal advice on whether it can recoup some of the £450,000 payoff given 
to Mr Entwistle, but was not hopeful.
