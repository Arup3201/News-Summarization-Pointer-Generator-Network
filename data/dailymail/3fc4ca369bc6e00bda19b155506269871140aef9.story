An experiment has shown how easy it is for fraudsters to find out a worrying level of personal information online - using just an email address.

A team of actors set up a mailing list for bar customers, before using their email addresses to research their details online.

Minutes later, they had garnered so much private information on the individuals that they could convince them they had known them for years.

The shocking experiment, captured on video for credit reference agency Experian, shows the dangers of leaving yourself open to online ID fraud.

The set up: Ad agency Abundance targeted five unsuspecting customers at a bar after getting information about them from an email list

The project then searched the internet for information on their victims, before getting ready to approach them

It reveals how easy it is for a stranger to research individuals - and also highlights the worrying amount of personal details that can be found from just an email.

The video starts: 'Could we convince five perfect strangers that we were old friends...using only information anyone could find online?'

It goes on to show the actors asking bar customers to put their emails on a mailing list, before using them to research their personal details on Google, Facebook and other websites.

The researchers are then filmed going 
back into the bar and trying to convince the customers they know them 
based on details they have found out, including their previous holidays,
 names, jobs, birthdays and even where they went to school.

One
 man, called Ziggy, appears initially shocked when a female researcher 
calls his name - but then quickly gives her a hug and says 'Oh my god, 
how are you doing?'

Stunt: The actors then went in to convince their victims that they were old friends

After they found out what had happened, the prank victims were left shocked that the actors knew so much about them

Meanwhile,
 another man called Tom visibly struggles to place his apparent old 
classmate, Richard, but remains polite and shakes his hand.

And
 one woman even apologies to a female researcher who claims she danced 
alongside her at a festival, saying: 'I'm so sorry, that was so rude of 
me.'

The video also features a man who claims his memory is 'coming back' to him, a woman who believes the meeting is 'so weird', and several customers who even agree to hand their mobile number over to researchers. 

When the customers eventually realised they had been fooled, they were all visibly stunned.

The People's ID Bot Project and London agency Abundance conducted the experiment

One woman was captured holding her hands up to her face in shock, while another asked: 'So how did you know about all of that stuff?'

A
 group called The People’s ID Bot Project and London agency Abundance 
conducted the experiment after setting up an email list for drinkers and 
searching the web for information about them.

It was released after it was revealed last week that a cyber attack has compromised the details of 145 million eBay users.

The auction site has been blasted for an
 'inexcusable delay' in taking action after its 
servers were hacked three months ago.

Caroline Thomas, MD Identity, Experian Consumer Services, said: 'The video was produced by Experian as part of our ongoing online identity protection education strategy, with the goal of having Britons sit up and take notice how much of people's personally-identifiable information is freely available online, often without them even realising.

'This same information, in the wrong hands, could be used to commit identity fraud or sold on to other criminals, often without the victim knowing until after a crime has been committed.

'While we enjoy the fantastic value and convenience the web has to offer, it’s important to be vigilant in protecting our online identities, too.

'Cybercrime is becoming increasingly complex and organised so exercising caution and making some simple changes to your online behaviour are key to helping protect yourself from becoming a victim.'
