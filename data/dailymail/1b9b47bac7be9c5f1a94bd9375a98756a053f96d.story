When spaniel-cross Bodie goes for a walk, you can be sure of one thing – best friend Biddy won’t be far away. In fact, the chihuahua-cross usually hitches a lift on the nine-year-old’s back.

But the pair’s special bond has made it hard for charity workers at a Dogs Trust home in Merseyside to find them a new owner because the dogs can’t bear to be apart.

Manager Georgina Lowery said: ‘We hope someone will have room in their home and heart to keep them together and give these fantastic dogs the love they deserve.’

Assistant manager Katherine Stulberg added: ‘Biddy likes to climb on Bodie’s back and at night she even sleeps on top of him.'

The website of the Merseyside Dogs Trust describes Bodie as a 'beautiful boy'.

'This lad is a fantastic all-rounder, good with dogs and kids but he can't be separated from his side-kick, Biddy, as they are something of a double act,' the website says.

'He has very good manners and loves cuddles and fusses. Bodie can live with children over the age of 5, he's a little bulky but very gentle.

'He gets along well with other dogs but does prefer quieter ones. Bodie is fabulous but can be quite strong on the lead so will need a new owner who can manage him.'
