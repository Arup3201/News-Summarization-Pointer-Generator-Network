Locked into wire mesh cages, four men including a former BBC producer are paraded before a court in Cairo.

They were marched from their cells in white prison uniform to face accusations of terror-related offences.

Peter Greste, who worked for the BBC in Afghanistan, Latin America and Africa, is among three journalists and 17 others charged with providing a platform to the outlawed Muslim Brotherhood group of the democratically-elected former president Mohamed Morsi.

Suhaib Saeed, left, a student who is charged with helping three al Jazeera journalists falsify news accounts about Egypt, wore a t-shirt whose Arabic inscription read 'Scorpion Prison in Egypt's Guantanamo'

The three journalists were arrested after the military backed government of Egypt declared the Muslim Brotherhood a terrorist organisation, in their Cairo hotel where they had set up a temporary office

In an unusual move, the judge, Mohammed Nagi Shehata, eventually allowed the defendants to approach the bench to deliver their pleas in a previous hearing

The 45-year-old Australian, who works 
for Arab TV channel Al Jazeera, describes the charges as ‘preposterous’ 
and an international campaign has been launched to secure his 
release.   

Mr Greste and two other defendants asked to be freed on 
bail.

Australian Journalist Peter Greste had only been in the country for two weeks before being arrested

Judge Mohammed Nagi 
Shehata denied the requests, despite international pressure and 
allegations that the charges have been made up because of hostility 
between the Doha-based TV station and Egyptian authorities.

Mr Greste told the judge he had been in Egypt for only two weeks before his arrest.

‘The
 idea that I could have an association with the Muslim Brotherhood is 
frankly preposterous,’ he said.

‘Our only desire at this point is to 
continue to fight and clear our names from outside of prison.’

Al
 Jazeera English bureau chief Mohamed Fahmy, who holds dual 
Canadian-Egyptian citizenship, also denied links to the Muslim 
Brotherhood, saying he was an alcohol-drinking liberal who had lived 
abroad for a long time.

‘Have you ever heard of a Muslim terrorist that drinks alcohol?’ he asked.

Other defendants claimed they had been abused and tortured during interrogation.

Mr
 Greste’s parents had hoped he would be released after Australian Prime 
Minister Tony Abbott took up the case with interim Egyptian President 
Adly Mansour.

The hearing came days after a judge sentenced to death hundreds of Egyptians with alleged links to the Muslim Brotherhood.

Many of the defendants have claimed the conditions in the Egyptian holding cells are akin to Guantanamo Bay, with one defendant asking for bail so that he could attend a private hospital for a broken arm
