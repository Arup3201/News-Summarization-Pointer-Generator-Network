The Nobel Peace Prize has been awarded to the watchdog responsible for preventing the use of chemical weapons. 

The Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW), is working to destroy Syria's massive chemical weapons stockpile after a sarin gas strike in the suburbs of Damascus killed more than 1,400 people in August.

The Pakistan Taliban have said they are 'delighted' that Malala Yousafzai, the 16-year-old schoolgirl they tried to kill, missed out on the award after being widely tipped to win.

Horrific: Damascus agreed to destroy all its chemical weapons after Washington threatened to use force in response to the killing of hundreds of people in a sarin attack on the outskirts of Damascus on August 21

Malala Yousafzai, 16, was shot in the head on a school bus by the Taliban for championing women's right to education and was widely tipped to win the award

Spokesman Shahidullah Shahid said the campaigner for women's education had done nothing to deserve the Nobel.

He said: 'We are delighted that she didn't get it. She did nothing big so it's good that she didn't get it.

'This award should be given to the real Muslims who are struggling for Islam. Malala is against Islam, she is secular.'

The 16-year-old who moved to Birmingham after she was shot in the head by the Taliban for championing girls' right to education.

A petition for Malala to be short-listed attracted more than half a million signatures from across the globe.

On
 Thursday, the teenager was awarded the European Union's highest human 
rights honour, the Sakharov Award, whose previous recipients have 
included past Nobel prize winners the former South African president 
Nelson Mandela and Burmese politician Aung San Suu Kyi.

Malala has earned plaudits across the 
world for her bravery and determination since recovering from a failed 
assassination attempt by the Pakistani Taliban in October last year in 
which she was shot in the head as she travelled with classmates on a 
school bus.

Only because
 of emergency medical treatment in Pakistan, and an airlift to the Queen
 Elizabeth Hospital in Birmingham, did she survive the attack.

Since
 the age of 11, Malala has campaigned for the right to education for 
girls in her country - something the Taliban has strongly opposed.

Despite the attempt on her life, she has continued to champion children's access to the classroom.

She now claims that her ambition is to become Prime Minister after her dreams of winning the Nobel Prize were quashed.

Elsewhere more furious critics have branded the decision an 'award to Assad' saying the prize is supporting the regime accusing the judges of being premature.

One Twitter activist called Shami Witness said: 'They are insulting the martyrs, intentional humiliation of the victims. This is an award to Assad and Putin.'

The OPCW is tasked with upholding the Chemical Weapons Convention which prohibits the production and use of chemical weapons 

Meanwhile human rights workers  
pointed out that the organisation had been given the award in the one 
year during its 16-year existence when chemical weapons had been used on
 a mass scale.

Nadim Houry, director of the Beirut office of Human Rights Watch, said: 'I would have thought 2013 would have been a year for soul searching at OPCW, not accolades.'

In August the world was shocked by images of thousands of pale bodies, many of them children, beamed across the globe following a sarin nerve gas attack in Damascus.

Warheads landed in the suburbs of Ain Tarma, Zamalka and Jobar just before dawn, meaning many of the victims died in their beds.

Since then the Syrian rebels and government have pointed the finger of blame at one another, while Russia and the US have agreed a peace plan which will see the destruction of President Assad's chemical weapons stockpile.

The OPCW have been handed the task, which they say could take months to complete.

It is not the first time in the prize's history that it has courted controversy.

In 2009 the committee drew criticism after deciding to give the award to US President Barack Obama as a calling to make sure his Presidency lived up to the high standards set during his first election campaign.

Since then, much to the ire of activists, Guantanamo Bay prison has remained open, drone strikes in Pakistan have intensified and America has maintained a military presence in Afghanistan.
