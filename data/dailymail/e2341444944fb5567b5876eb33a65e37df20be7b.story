New laws are expected to be introduced today which will allow authorities to shut down notorious Gold Coast 'party houses', which are often used for unruly weekend-long parties that distress and terrify neighbours.

It is believed there are more than 500 of the infamous 'party houses' across the Gold Coast, which are often situated in residential areas.

They regularly attract criticism and complaints from neighbours about noise, public nudity, lewd behaviour and violence.

A blow has been struck to the Gold Coast's notorious 'party houses' as legislation to be introduced today will allow councils to declare some areas 'party house' exclusion zones

The new laws have been prompted by complaints from local residents about the noise and lewd behaviour of party-goers staying in the houses

The new laws, which are part of the changes to the Sustainable Planning Act, will allow local councils to institute 'party house restriction areas' where short-term rental properties will be forbidden from operating.

Under the new laws all short-term rental property operators will also be forced to register with the council.

The legislation is due to be voted on in Queensland state parliament today and is expected to pass due to the Newman government's majority.

The laws have been welcomed by local residents, many of whom have been agitating for tougher laws for years.

Some residents who live near a 'party house' have said they are afraid to leave their homes while a weekend-long party is raging and are tormented by the noise and activities next door.

The parties often terrified the local residents and meant they were afraid to go outside their properties on weekends

Neighbours complained they weren't able to take their children outside because of the nudity on display at the 'party houses'

The 'party houses' are short-term rental accommodations properties that are rented out for weekends to party-goers
