Britain's biggest insurer has called for a ban on whiplash payouts to save motorists £32 a year on their premiums.

Aviva, which insures 2.5million drivers, blamed a ‘compensation culture’ and ‘ambulance-chasing lawyers’ for a flood of bogus insurance claims.

The firm has suggested ending virtually all payments for minor neck injuries – which average around £2,500 each – in a move that has been dismissed as ‘diabolically ludicrous’ by lawyers.

Whiplash insurance claims, which account for 94 per cent of car crash claims, should be banned, say Aviva

Insurers should only cover the cost of ‘rehabilitating’ those who say they were hurt, it says. This would involve firms assessing injuries then paying for any treatment needed.

Those who cannot work would still get compensation but it would root out others who may be trying to make a bogus claim.

Aviva says the move could save £900million and knock £32 off the average annual motor insurance premium of £358.

Whiplash claims accounted for 94 per cent of all its personal injury claims from motor accidents last year.

Maurice Tulloch, from Aviva, said: ‘If the UK is serious about reducing the cost of motor insurance we have to address the way we compensate minor whiplash, using rehabilitation only to treat genuine, minor injuries.’

The firm also suggested raising the claim threshold at which personal injury lawyers can get involved from £1,000 to £5,000.

Craig Budsworth, of the Motor Accident Solicitors Society, told the Financial Times: ‘This can’t happen. It’s diabolically ludicrous. You’re being compensated for the fact you’ve suffered a traumatic event.’

Aviva, which insures 2.5million drivers, say the plans would dramatically reduce the price of insuring a car
