TOWIE star Bobby Cole Norris has revealed his mother needs a life-saving bone marrow transplant after she was diagnosed with leukaemia.

The 27-year-old launched a desperate plea to find a donor - his mother's 'best hope' of beating the vicious disease.

Bobby, an only child, said he is devastated having always been very close to his mother Kym, 54, a dental receptionist.

He said: 'My mum means the world to me and I love her to the moon and back.

TOWIE star Bobby Cole Norris has launched an appeal to find a bone marrow donor for his mother Kym after she was diagnosed with leukaemia

'The last few weeks have felt like I have been living a nightmare, and I can't wake up from it.

'My mum is my best friend, I'm devastated.

'I didn't really know anything about leukaemia at all, I thought it was a cancer only children could get - now everything's just turned upside down for me.

'It's just so much to take in but I'm spending every day at the hospital with mum, and I'm learning as we go.

'I now know that for people who need a transplant, it's usually their last chance.'

The devastating news came in the last few weeks, just a month ago the fashion designer and his mother had no reason to suspect there was anything wrong.

'I was filming for TOWIE and everything was as normal,' said Bobby, who joined the cast in 2012.

'Mum seemed herself and was physically doing everything she has always done on a daily basis, like walking to work and back, keeping the house in order and dog-sitting for my dog Beau.

'A few weeks ago she started feeling a bit run down and tired, but other than that things were still really normal.'

Blood tests revealed she had a form of blood cancer called acute myeloid leukaemia.

Bobby, an only child, said he is devastated at his mother's diagnosis. The 54-year-old is currently in hospital and is receiving intensive chemotherapy twice a day to try and treat the disease

Doctors told Bobby and his family last week that his mother's best hope is a bone marrow transplant to try and treat the disease

'Mum was rushed to hospital that very same day, and hasn't been allowed home since,' Bobby said.

'We're being brave for each other. I know she doesn't want me to see her upset or scared and vice versa.

'So we're both keeping strong for each other when I visit, but as soon as I get outside the hospital and into the car park, that's when I'm breaking down in tears.'

Ms Norris has been receiving intense chemotherapy twice a day, but doctors told the family last week that the treatment alone would not be enough to cure her of the disease.

'We were told that mum has a gene that will prevent the chemotherapy working to its full potential,' said Bobby.

'Her best hope of survival now is a bone marrow transplant.

'I’m an only child and my mum had lost contact with her brother.

'But we have recently managed to track him down to arrange a test to see if he is a potential match for mum, but siblings aren't always guaranteed matches – the vast majority of people have to rely on finding an unrelated donor.

'So it’s now a waiting game to see if we can find a stranger on the Anthony Nolan bone marrow register who is a match for mum and who is willing to donate their stem cells to her.

'It could literally be anyone – I recently found myself passing strangers at Lakeside Shopping Centre or traffic lights, and thinking, you could be a match for my mum or somebody else suffering from this terrible disease.'

Bobby appeared on ITV's This Morning to urge people to sign up to the Anthony Nolan bone marrow register in a bid to help find a donor for his mother

Bobby is now lending his support to blood cancer charity Anthony Nolan, which runs the UK bone marrow register and is marking its fortieth anniversary this week.

He has launched a Twitter appeal #SaveBobbysMum and is urging fans to sign up.

'I know I’m not the only one this is happening to,' he said. 'There are other families being told the same news every single day – today, this evening, tomorrow.

'Two thirds of them will rely on Anthony Nolan to find them their lifesaving donor.

'A stranger to one person is another person's mum... These donors are lifesavers and I'm bowled over by the kindness of strangers who do this'

- Bobby Norris

'I feel completely helpless right now, but all I can do apart from being there for mum is to try to raise awareness of the Anthony Nolan register, particularly to young people who are much more likely to go on to donate and save a life.'

Bobby is now backing an Anthony Nolan campaign which launched this week, calling on people to ‘save a stranger’s life’.

Since appearing on ITV's This Morning to appeal for a donor for his mother, the charity said they have seen a 2050 per cent rise in people signing the donor register online.

So far 817 people have added their names to the database, since yesterday. Up from 38 on August 12 last year.

'A stranger to one person is another person’s mum,' Bobby said.

'For the donor, it’s probably just a case of sitting still for a few hours while the stem cells are taken out of their blood.

'But for me, and for families like mine, it’s the difference between having my mum around or not.

'It’s everything. These donors are lifesavers and I’m bowled over by the kindness of strangers who do this.'

Fashion designer Bobby tweeted his appeal for a bone marrow donor for his mother, launching the #SaveBobbysMum hashtag

After appearing on ITV's This Morning yesterday, Bobby tweeted to reveal the Anthony Nolan website had experienced an influx of visitors

To join the Anthony Nolan register, you must be aged between 16 and 30 and in good health.

Bobby has urged everybody who is eligible to be on the Anthony Nolan register to log their details to  one day potentially save somebody's life. 

'We only ever get one mum, so let's look after them and each other’s, and sign up to be on the Anthony Nolan register,' he added.

Ann O’Leary, Head of Register Development at Anthony Nolan said: 'We can’t thank Bobby enough for helping to spread the word about donating stem cells, particularly at such a difficult time for his family.

'There are still many misconceptions out there about what’s involved.

'For example, most people don’t know that nine times out of ten, the process is very similar to giving blood, and joining the register just involves spitting into a tube.

'Bobby is also absolutely right that we urgently need young people to come forward and join the register, particularly men aged 16 to 30 as they’re currently underrepresented.

'Any one of Bobby’s fans who he inspires to join the register, could one day save a life - but unless they sign up, they’ll never have this chance.'
