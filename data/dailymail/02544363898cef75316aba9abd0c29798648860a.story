Ed Miliband  refused seven times to deny that he wanted to ‘weaponise’ the NHS in the forthcoming election campaign.

At Prime Minister's Questions in the Commons last week, David Cameron accused the Labour leader of using the ‘disgusting’ term in a private conversation, citing it as proof that Mr Miliband intended to make the NHS a ‘political football’ in the upcoming battle for power.

When he was repeatedly asked in a live TV interview if he had indeed used the word, Mr Miliband would say only that he could not recall whether he had done or not.

When he was repeatedly asked in a live TV interview if he had threatened to 'weaponise' the NHS, Labour leader Ed Miliband would say only that he could not recall whether he had done or not

The Labour leader told BBC1's Andrew Marr Show: ‘What I've said is I want to fight for the NHS. I don't recall exactly what I said.

'But we are in a fight for the National Health Service, and I make absolutely no apologies for the fact that I'm really concerned about what's happening to our National Health Service in this country.

‘I don't recall exactly what I said, but what I'm clear about is we are in a fight for the NHS and I think that's really important. The Prime Minister went into the last general election and he said he could be trusted with the National Health Service.'

He added: 'He has betrayed that trust with people. We've seen an NHS where we've seen tents erected in hospital car parks this week.’

Challenged over whether he would disown the word ‘weaponise’, Mr Miliband said: ‘What I don't disown... what I absolutely stand by is that we are in a fight for the future of the National Health Service.

'I don't think this is about the words we use, this is about how we are going to change this country so that we have an NHS that properly works for people again and isn't going backwards, as it is under this Government.’

David Cameron said it was 'disgusting' for Mr Miliband to say he wanted to 'weaponise' the NHS to win votes

At Wednesday's session of PMQs, Mr Cameron said: ‘The Leader of the Opposition apparently said to the political editor of the BBC, “I want to weaponise the NHS”. 

'That is what he said, and I think that is disgraceful.'

‘The NHS is not a weapon, it is a way we care for our families, it is a way we care for the elderly, it is a way we look after the frail. Perhaps when he gets to his feet he will deny that he said he wanted to “weaponise” the NHS – a disgusting thing to say.’

Following Mr Miliband’s interview, BBC political editor Nick Robinson tweeted: ‘If anyone doubted Ed Miliband spoke of "weaponising" NHS I think he cleared that up on Marr just now – repeatedly didn't deny or disown it.’
