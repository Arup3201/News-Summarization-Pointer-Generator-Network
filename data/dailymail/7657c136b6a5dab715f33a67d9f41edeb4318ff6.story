A man who died after falling six storeys from a Darwin apartment balcony is believed to have taken a form of ecstasy before the tragedy.

The 20-year-old man was in cardiac arrest when St John Ambulance arrived at the Zest Apartments on Gardiner St on Tuesday night, but he was later pronounced dead at Royal Darwin Hospital, the NT News reported.

Witnesses told police the man was acting strangely prior to the fall after taking a pill referred to as a 'Quacka' - described as blue in colour with a logo depicting an image similar to rabbit ears or a pair of scissors.

The man plummeted from a ninth-storey balcony and landed on a third-storey balcony at about 6.30pm.

The man's death comes after a 16-year-old girl died at a rural property on Sunday morning who is believed to have ingested illicit drugs at a party.

Superintendent Tony Fuller from the Drug and Organised Crime Division said detectives from the Major Crime Squad and the Drug and Organised Crime Squad have formed a task force and are investigating both cases.

'Police strongly suspect that in both cases the drugs taken were a form of synthetic LSD or MDMA (ecstasy). These drugs are usually manufactured overseas and then sold in a variety of forms such as tablets, powder or tabs.'

Supt Fuller said the drugs were not clinically tested on humans and are produced purely for the financial gain of the suppliers.

'It is tragic that the need to again warn people about the dangers of these drugs follows on from the death of two teenagers,' he said.

'We are asking the parents of teenagers to talk to your kids and warn them of the dangers they face if experimenting with these drugs.'

Department of Health Chief Health Officer, Dr Steven Skov warned that taking these drugs could cause people to completely lose touch with reality.

'The psychotic reaction these drugs might trigger can result in tragic consequences if the person is unable to control their thoughts and actions,' he said.

'On top of psychosis we've seen other life threatening results from taking synthetic drugs including convulsions, dangerously high blood pressure, extreme aggression and panic attacks.'

Dr Skov said people had no way of knowing exactly what they are taking or the strength of the dose. 

'These substances are changing all the time so we can't know what all of the possible side effects are,' he said.

'If you know someone has taken drugs, watch them closely and try to keep them safe. Once someone has started losing touch with reality, dangerous consequences can happen quickly.'
