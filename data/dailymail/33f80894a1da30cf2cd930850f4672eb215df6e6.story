Student halls in Oxford, a budget hotel in central London and a 'vertical pier' in Redcar are all in the running to be named Britain's ugliest new building.

The shortlist for the annual Carbuncle Cup has been revealed, highlighting six new buildings judged to be the latest 'architectural travesties' erected across Britain.

The name of the competition is inspired by Prince Charles's description of Richard Rogers proposed National Gallery extension as a 'monstrous carbuncle on the face of a much-loved friend.'

Controversial: Oxford University's Castle Mill student accommodation by Port Meadow, Oxford, which has the unenviable distinction of being the most-nominated project in the history of the Carbuncle Cup

That extension was never built, but the prince's evocative description lives on thanks to trade magazine Building Design, which launched the competition eight years ago as a comic counterpart to the prestigious Stirling prize.

In a statement the magazine said: 'Even in times of economic turmoil, when few major projects are being built, hundreds of architectural travesties are allowed to pass through our planning system on a weekly basis.

'Few of these are ever truly exposed 
for the awfulness they represent - lazy design, compromised planning 
departments and cynical development.'

The
shortlist has been whittled down from hundreds of nominations sent in 
by readers of Building Design, which caters to an audience of architects
and designers.

Grim: The UCL student accommodation at 465 Caledonian Road was nearly refused planning permission because of a lack of natural light

First on the list is a project that has had the unenviable distinction of being the most-nominated development in the history of the Carbuncle Cup, says Building Design.

Castle Mill housing in Oxford, designed by Frankham Consultancy Group, is comprised of eight very plain blocks of Oxford University student accommodation plonked right next to the picturesque Port Meadow, an area of land beside the Thames that has hardly changed in thousands of years.

The project, described as like building a 'skyscraper next to Stonehenge', has been mired in controversy and it is now at the centre of a judicial review bid to determine if the planning process which led to its approval was properly carried out.

Another block of student accommodation which made the Carbuncle Cup's shortlist was initially refused its planning permission on the grounds that not enough light would enter the building to make it liveable.

The block at number 465 Caledonian Road, near King's Cross, which will house students at University College London was only built after an inspector decided that the student lifestyle meant that rooms would only be used for sleeping - so they didn't need their legal quota of natural light.

Despite its £18milllion pound cost, The Islington Tribune quoted one local resident who described the development as 'so cheap and aesthetically bankrupt it can only be described as an insult to the people of N7, and the architectural profession.'

It is designed by Stephen George & Partners.

'Grossly over-scaled': The Avant Garde building on Bethnal Green Road in Shoreditch, London, a 'characterless lump' which critics have slammed for failing to blend into the Victorian buildings that surround it

Another residential monstrosity in the running for Britain's ugliest building of the year is the 25-storey Avant Garde building on Bethnal Green Road in London's trendy Shoreditch area, which Building Design describe as 'grossly over-scaled'.

The Stock Woolstencroft development has been slammed for its failure to blend in with neighbouring Victorian buildings, with the critic who nominated it calling it a 'hideous monstrosity... a characterless lump that is totally out of scale to the buildings around it.'

The third London newbuild to make the shortlist is the 234-room Premier Inn on York Road in Waterloo, designed by Hamiltons, part of which is housed in a listed former maternity hospital.

'Lumpen': The 234-room Premier Inn on York Road in Waterloo, designed by Hamiltons, is the third London building to make the Carbuncle Cup shortlist, and which building design describes as a 'travesty'

The rest of the building has taken the place of a Thirties red-brick neo-Georgian nurses' home demolished to make was for its tower.

Building Design says: 'The Premier Inn in Lambeth is a travesty in more ways than one - we shudder at its lumpen form and mourn the building demolished to make way for it.'

Elsewhere, the Redcar Beacon by Smeeden Foreman Architects is slammed as 'shape making gone horribly, horribly wrong.'

Vertical pier: The Redcar Beacon was unveiled in March as the centrepiece of a £75million seafront regeneration. Critics said they would have preferred a conventional, horizontal pier instead

'The dumpster': The stark-looking Porth Eirias Watersports Centre in Colwyn Bay, Wales, is also part of a multimillion pound seafront redevelopment, but its skip-like shape has led to an unfortunate nickname

The brightly coloured 80ft tower - reminiscent of the shape of a fun fair helter skelter - was unveiled in March as the centrepiece of a £75million seafront regeneration on the North East seaside town.

It is described as a 'vertical pier', but critics said they would have preferred a normal, horizontal pier instead.

Making up the final place on the Carbuncle Cup shortlist is the Porth Eirias Watersports Centre in Colwyn Bay, Wales, by K2 Architects.

The stark-looking structure is also part of a multimillion pound seafront redevelopment, but its curious skip-like shape has now apparently led locals to dub it 'the dumpster'.

A critic dubbed it 'oppressively bland and totally insensitive to the beautiful surrounding coast.'

A final winner will be selected by a jury including Building Design executive editor Ellis Woodman and critics Owen Hatherley and Gillian Darley and announced on August 30.
