Former Liverpool centre back Jamie Carragher has told Brendan Rodgers that he must continue to select Dejan Lovren despite the Croat's lack of form in recent weeks.

Lovren, who became Liverpool's most expensive defender in the summer after completing a £20million switch from Southampton, has been heavily criticised in recent weeks for failing to perform against the likes of Real Madrid, Newcastle and Chelsea.

However Carragher has jumped to the defence of Lovren by suggesting he has to get used to Liverpool's style of play.

Speaking in an exclusive interview with the Liverpool Echo, Carragher said: 'I thought he was excellent for Southampton last season and that is the reason Liverpool bought him but every manager has a different way of doing things.

'Liverpool's full backs are more offensive and so are going to leave you more exposed, that could be something to look at because Brendan Rodgers likes his full backs to get forward.

'But when you pay that much money for a centre back you have to persist with it and get him through it.

'Get Lovren to learn your values but it is also about getting to know him and playing to his strengths and weaknesses.' 

The 25-year-old has been an ever-present for Rodgers' side in the Premier League since the beginning of the campaign.
