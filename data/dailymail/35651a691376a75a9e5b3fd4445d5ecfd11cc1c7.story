For 45 years, the Charlie Hebdo magazine has unashamedly poked fun at taboo topics the mainstream publications would not dare to.

But one of its founders, Henri Roussel, believes it was the former editor Stephane Charbonnier's 'pig-headed' insistence on satirising Islam that lead to his, and seven of his colleagues' deaths.

The man known as 'Charb was among 17 people killed in a wave of terror attacks in Paris last week, which began with a massacre in his own office.

Writing in this week's Nouvel Obs magazine, Roussel accuses Charbonnier of 'dragging the team' to their deaths by releasing increasingly provocative cartoons such as the images of the Prophet Muhammad.

Murdered: Charlie Hebdo's former editor Stephane Charbonnier (pictured) 'dragged the team' to their death by continuously mocking Islam, according to the magazine's founder Henri Roussel

Six of the Charlie Hebdo staff killed in Wednesday's attack are pictured together in this photo, taken in 2000. Circled top from left is Philippe Honore, Georges Wolinski, Bernard Maris and Jean Cabut. Below them on the stairs, from left, is editor Stephane Charbonnier and cartoonist Bernard ‘Tignous’ Verlhac

He described Charb as a 'brilliant bloke', but says he was foolish to 'over do' it by printing the controversial November 11 edition featuring images of Islam's central figure.

Roussel, asked: 'What made him feel the need to drag the team into overdoing it?'

referring to Charb' s decision to first post a Mohammed character on the magazine's front page in 2011.

He was referring to the first time the Prophet Muhammad featured on Charlie Hebdo's cover in 2011 - sparking furious reactions from the Muslim world, who consider the images blasphemous.

Their headquarters were burned down by an unknown arsonist in a fire-ball attack a short time later.

Even Charb's former partner, Jeanette Bougrab, believed he would some day be 'assassinated'.

In an interview with BMFTV, the 41-year-old said: 'I begged him to leave France but he wouldn't. My companion is dead because he drew in a newspaper.'

Miss Bougrab, who had lived with Charb and her adopted daughter May for three years, added sadly: 'He never had children because he knew he was going to die. He lived without fear, but he knew he would die.'

Mr Roussel, who contributed to the first issue of the satirical weekly in 1970, said: 'He shouldn't have done it, but Charb did it again a year later, in September 2012.'

The magazine's founder claims his friend Georges Wolinski - one of the cartoonists who died in the deadly attack on January 7 - also had reservations about the controversial edition.

'I think we are thoughtless imbeciles who have taken a useless risk, that's all,' Roussel claims that Wolinski told him back in 2011.

'We think we're invulnerable. For years, decades even, we stir things up and then one day all our stirring blows up in our face. We shouldn't have done it.'

Richard Malka, the lawyer who has represented Charlie Hebdo the past 22 years, reacted furiously at Roussel's comments. 

Tragic: A desk is still covered with the day's work, along with empty water bottles and a coffee mug, inside the offices of Charlie Hebdo - while underneath the chair there is a pool of blood

Massacre: Two masked men, Said and Cherif Kouachi, burst into the Charlie Hebdo office (pictured) and began shooting journalists

Remembrance: Jeannette Bougrab (pictured), the partner of deceased Charlie Hebdo editor, Charb, attended a ceremony today as her former boyfriend was made an honorary citizen of Paris

Demand: An early morning queue forms in France, as people try to get their hands on the 'survivors' edition of Charlie Hebdo

Sold out: A sign at a Paris news-stand informs customers that they have already run out of copies

He said: 'Charb has not yet even been buried and Obs (the magazine which printed Roussel's column) finds nothing better to do that to publish a polemical and venomous piece on him.'

Defending his decision to publish the piece, Nouvel Obs' editor Matthieu Croissandeau,  said: 'We received this text and after a debate I decided to publish it in an edition on freedom of expression, it would have seemed to me worrisome to have censored his voice, even if it is discordant.

'Particularly as this is the voice of one of the pioneers of the gang.'

The first issue of the magazine since the attacks again depicts the Prophet Muhammad on the front cover.

Unprecedented demand for the magazine across Europe has meant an extra two million copies of the 'survivors' edition will be printed - adding to the three million which already have been.

The issue sold out instantly around Paris on Wednesday, as people queued around the corner to get their copies.
