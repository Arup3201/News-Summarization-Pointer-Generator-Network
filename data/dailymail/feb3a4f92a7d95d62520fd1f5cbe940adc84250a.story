A computer engineer who admitted causing the death of a woman when he ploughed a £100,000 Audi R8 Spyder into her sister's car was 'showing off', it emerged today.

Saqib Hussain, 24, was speeding in the supercar when he slammed into a Ford Fiesta as Noreen Ryan and her sister Mary returned from a family member's 16th birthday party in Hall Green, Birmingham, last August.

Noreen, 49, was killed in the horrific crash, while driver Mary, 60, suffered a punctured lung, broken pelvis, broken ribs and a chipped spine.

Hussain pleaded guilty to causing death by dangerous driving, but Noreen's relatives revealed that he already had a speeding conviction to his name.

Hussain initially fled the scene but was arrested when he handed himself in at a police station later the same night.

And he pleaded guilty to causing death by dangerous driving and whilst uninsured when he appeared at Birmingham Crown Court yesterday.

Hussain, from Acocks Green, Birmingham, also admitted causing serious injury to two other people, including the passenger of his car, by dangerous driving and failing to stop after a collision.

Judge Melbourne Inman QC bailed Hussain and banned him from driving until his sentencing on September 15.

He told him: 'You must understand that for the gravity of this offence a prison sentence is inevitable.'

Prosecutor Joanne Barker told the court Hussain wouldn't have ploughed into and killed Noreen if he had not been speeding.

She said: 'It is not the prosecution case he was racing with the Mercedes vehicle behind. The prosecution would submit he may well have been showing off.

'He did not adjust his speed despite seeing her. He was going too fast to do anything about it. The collision would not have occurred if he had not been travelling at the speed he was.'

Speaking outside court, Noreen's brother Chris Ryan said: 'It has been a very difficult time for the family and the whole experience in court was awful.

'It has already been revealed in court that he has been convicted of speeding before. It is ludicrous that he has been driving right up until the court appearance this week.

'There will not be any justice whatever happens. It is not going to bring her back.'

Mr Ryan said she had been her 'usual lovely and bubbly self' at the birthday party earlier that night. 

'She and Mary left at around 11.10pm with some birthday cake on Noreen's lap and dropped off my mother on the way back. That was the last time we saw her,' he added. 

Birmingham City football fan Noreen lived on her own in Kings Norton, Birmingham, but was devoted to her grandchildren and her former partner's children. 

Horrific: Reports suggest Noreen was holding a piece of birthday cake on her lap at the time of the crash

A family tribute to Noreen, the youngest of her seven brothers and sisters, described her as the 'heart, spark and soul' of her family.

It said: 'Birmingham City was Noreen's passion in life and she was a season ticket holder who never missed a match.

'But her family was also very important to her and she was a much-loved stepmother, step grandmother, daughter, sister and aunty to her nieces and nephews.

'Noreen was the heart, spark and soul of her family. She was over-generous and loved buying presents at Christmas and birthdays.

'She enjoyed a glass of prosecco with the girls and had a great sense of humour and some fantastic one-liners.

'She had watched all of Birmingham City's home matches with her brother John since they were kids. She always had the last word on football debates.'

Crime scene: Debris was thrown all over the road during the crash which occurred as the sisters returned home from her niece's 16th birthday party

Judge Melbourne Inman QC allowed Hussain bail but told him: 'You must understand that for the gravity of this offence a prison sentence is inevitable.'

He also imposed a driving ban on the defendant. Previously Noreen’s sister-in-law, Maria Ryan, paid tribute to the 49-year-old, from a family of eight.

She said: 'They had been at our home in Solihull on the night of the crash to celebrate our daughter Gemma’s birthday. She had been her usual lovely and bubbly self.

'She and Mary left at around 11.10pm with some birthday cake on Noreen’s lap and dropped off my mother on the way back. That was the last time we saw her.'
