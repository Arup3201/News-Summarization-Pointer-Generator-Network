Iced: Tampa bay Lightning left wing Ryan Malone was booked on DUI and cocaine possession charges early Saturday morning in Tampa, just blocks from the team's arena

Tampa Bay Lightning left wing Ryan Malone was arrested early Saturday morning and charged with DUI and cocaine possession.

Malone, 34, was pulled over only blocks from the teams arena just before 3.30 a.m. after police saw his SUV hit a curb. Cops said they smelled alcohol on his breath and found 1.3 grams of cocaine in one of his back pockets.

The 10-year pro was released only hours later after posting bond, but he did not make the team trip to Washington, D.C., for the team's Sunday game against the Capitals.

Malone refused to take field sobriety tests, but a breath test given at the jail recorded blood alcohol levels of 0.112 and 0.116 percent, a police spokesperson said.

Florida law considers a driver impaired at 0.08.

Malone was released from the Hillsborough County jail on $2,500 bond. Jail records did not list an attorney.

General manager Steve Yzerman said in a Saturday morning statement that Malone was held back from this weekend's game.

'Ryan will not travel with the team to Washington today, but beyond that we cannot comment further at this time.'

NHL deputy commissioner Bill Daly was also cryptic about Malone's future.

'Mr. Malone is subject to mandatory evaluation and, if deemed necessary by the Program Doctors, treatment,' said Daly in a statement. 'His future playing status, both in the near term and during the [Stanley Cup] Playoffs, will be determined in accordance the terms of our [drug treatment program].'

The playoffs are set to start Wednesday. The second place Lightning are slated to tangle with the Montreal Canadiens

The former Pittsburgh Penguin standout joined the Lightning in 2008 after signing a 7-year, $31.5million contract.

He has only five goals and 10 assists this year after tallying 20 goals and 28 assists as recently as the 2011-2012 season.

This season is Malone's least productive in which he did not spend significant time on the disabled list.
