Germany coach Joachim Low is leaving no stone unturned as he prepares for Sunday’s World Cup final against Argentina and he was still hard at work while strolling along the beach on Thursday.

Low was walking at the squad’s training base with scout Urs Siegenthaler, who suddenly stopped, bent down and started drawing lines in the sand.

Siegenthaler, who has been gathering intelligence on Germany’s opponents for a decade, spent a minute sketching out a diagram which Low studied intently before it was washed away by a wave.

Low and Siegenthaler, both barefoot and in shorts, had earlier been engaged in an animated discussion while walking on the beach a few dozen metres away from photographers, autograph seekers and Germany fans.

Meanwhile, defender Benedikt Howedes remains calm ahead of Sunday’s showpiece.

He has been used as left-back by Low during the tournament and the Schalke defender is likely to be the one assigned to Argentina star Lionel Messi.

‘I’ll do my part, but it will be a collective effort. That’s how even a player of such quality can be stopped,’ Howedes said.

Howedes has already had to deal with another scoring sensation, Cristiano Ronaldo of Portugal. The Real Madrid superstar failed to score as Germany won its World Cup opener 4-0.

Usually a centre back, Howedes has defied skeptics with his performances at left back.

‘Since we are in the final, I must have done something right,’ he added,

‘I am playing in a position for which I haven’t trained. But I think I am helping the team with my presence.’

Germany started the tournament with four centre backs in its last line of defence but Philipp Lahm has since returned to right back from the midfield.

Howedes has played right back for Germany and Schalke when necessary but being on the left is a novelty.

‘For me, it’s completely crazy what’s going on. I still can’t believe it,’ he said. ‘It’s huge what’s happening to me and the final will be the highlight. We want the title.’

Hoewedes does not provide much attacking spark on the left flank but says that that’s his not priority anyway.

‘It’s not my job to send sensational crosses with my strong left foot,’ he said.
