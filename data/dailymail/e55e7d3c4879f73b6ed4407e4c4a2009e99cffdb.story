A mother-of-two is so allergic to being pregnant she developed a rash so itchy she was driven to scratch her body until it bled.

Claire Carter, from Preston in Lancashire, was diagnosed with the rare condition intrahepatic cholestasis of pregnancy, also known as ICP, while she was expecting her two daughters.

The 30-year'old's body was tricked into treating her pregnancy as though it was a foreign body, prompting what appeared to be an allergic reaction.

The itching sensation became so intense, Miss Carter would wake in the middle of the night, just to scratch - even resorting to using a fork to relieve the irritation.

The condition - intrahepatic cholestasis of pregnancy (ICP) - caused the now 30-year-old to come out in a rash left, leaving her suffering an unbearbale itching sensation during both pregnancies

But despite her extreme reaction to carrying a baby, Miss Carter recently gave birth to her second daughter, Penny.

She said: 'I was so happy when I found I was pregnant but the nausea became so intense and I was itching more and more.

'I couldn't control the urge to itch and it became so extreme that I would make myself bleed sometimes.

'I threw up hundreds of times during each pregnancy.

'I used to joke that I was supposed to be glowing but instead I was asking my fiancé Richard to hold my hands down to stop me itching.

'Despite the pain and unbearable symptoms I have gone on to have two beautiful little girls Phoebe and Penny.

'They were worth every second of discomfort.'

Miss Carter suffered from a rare condition during her pregnancies called intrahepatic cholestasis of pregnancy, also known as ICP.

ICP is a liver disorder  which affects the flow of bile and in extreme cases can cause still births.

The sales advisor said: 'I'm so lucky both my girls were okay and I count my blessings every day.

'My mum and even the midwife thought my extreme bouts of sickness were completely normal and just my hormones kicking in.

'Luckily by the time I was 20 week pregnant with Phoebe the sickness died down but unfortunately it was replaced with something much worse.'

Miss Carter first noticed the condition when she was 20 weeks pregnant with her first daughter, Phoebe, pictured right. Pictured left is Penny, who was born recently 

The mother-of-two began to feel an itching sensation - it was so uncomfortable that she'd use knives and forks to scratch with.

She said: 'The itch was unbearably intense and the scratching burned. 

Jenny Chambers, Founder of ICP Support said: 'ICP affects around 5,500 women each year in the UK.

'The main symptom is scratching that can be severe or mild and the symptoms may include dark urine and pale stools.

'Sometimes women can also feel unwell but others will feel perfectly healthy, a part from the itch.

'We're delighted that all went for Claire after she got in touch with us and thankfully both her girls were born safely.

'However for other mums this year the outcome has not been so fortunate so it's vital that women report their itching.

'We recommend that if you are pregnant and itching you contact your health professional who can order very simple blood tests to screen for ICP.' 

'When I was 30 week gone I decided enough was enough and my midwife advised I went to hospital. 

'I went to the Royal Preston Hospital and was given a scan and blood test.

'Just a few days later my consultant phoned me and explained that I had ICP.

'Apparently my liver wasn't coping with the rise in pregnancy hormones so it wasn't keeping the bile acids.

'The bile acids are necessary for digestion but which are toxic, at low enough levels in my body.

'I was terrified when I was told ICP can cause premature births and even worse still births.'

Miss Carter was put on medication to ease the itching and try and reduce the bile acid levels.'It was such a scary time, me and Richard worried so much for the baby, every check-up was nerve-racking.

'Three weeks later I went in for a scan and the consultant was worried as the baby has stopped growing,' she said.

'So just one week later on Boxing Day I was induced and 26 hours later our beautiful little girl was finally with us.

'Our little Phoebe weighed a tiny 4lb 8oz but thankfully she was perfectly healthy.

'Incredibly just a week after I'd given birth the ICP symptoms began to fade and my life got back to normal again.

Miss Carter, said her symptoms disappeared after giving birth to both her daughters. She added: 'I know I'm incredibly lucky, I suffered from ICP and many women lose their babies because of it'

'I have since gone on to have another little girl, Penny.

'Even though I had the same symptoms as before, they were even worse and more intense this time and I was induced at 34 weeks.

'I was put on medication at diagnosis at 25 weeks which took the edge off the itching and made the burning sensation bearable though.

'I have also been in touch with ICP Support, an amazing charity who I can't thank enough.

'I know I'm incredibly lucky, I suffered from ICP and many women lose their babies because of it.

'I have the most amazing family and thankfully my two girls are blossoming every day.'
