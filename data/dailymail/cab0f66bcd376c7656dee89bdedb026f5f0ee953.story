A suspected Islamic terrorist was shot dead by French police in front of his veiled wife and their young child today.

The man, in his 30s, was gunned down after firing a .357 Magnum revolver as armed officers swarmed into his house in the eastern city of Strasbourg.

Seven others, including another gunman in Paris, were arrested during a nationwide anti-terrorist operation.

Sting operation: A man, in his 30s, was shot dead as police arrested terror suspects around France

Armed siege: A policeman from the GIPN - French national police intervention groups - stands guard outside a building in Cannes, southeastern France, where me connected with an extremist Islamic group were arrested

Dramatic scenes: All the men arrested are believed to be part of the Salafist group which is waging a holy war in Europe

Organised: The anti-terror operation was carried out in several cities around France - notably in Strasbourg where a suspect was fatally wounded

All were suspected of being involved in an attack on a Jewish shop in which one person was slightly injured last month.

The extreme violence used by the authorities in the face of Muslim extremism was praised by President Francois Hollande who 'saluted the action of the police' and urged Interior Minister Manuel Valls to 'take all measures necessary to ensure vigilance.'

All the men targetted today were said to be linked to a Salafist group which is committed to waging a jihad - or holy war - across Europe.

It follows Mohammed Merah, a 23-year-old French Algerian with similar Salafism connections, shooting seven people, including four Jews, dead in the Toulouse area in March.

At least three policemen were injured 
in today's Strasboug raid, while others received direct hits to their 
bullet proof jackets and helmets.

The anti-terror operation comes after extremist Mohammed Merah killed seven people - including four Jews - in Toulouse in March

The suspect, meanwhile, was hit by a number of bullets and died at the scene, despite being treated by medics for his wounds.

The source said the man's veiled wife 
and child were in the Strasbourg house, and that the woman was one of 
those arrested for questioning.

'He was initially on the sofa, but then started to fire at police with a .357 Magnum,' the source added.

Dawn raid: Police raided the building in the Esplanade suburb of Strasbourg in the early hours on Saturday morning

It was part of a nationwide 
counter-terrorist operation aimed at capturing the gang responsible for 
planting a low explosive device in a kosher food shop in the northern 
Paris suburb of Sarcelles on September 19th.

A judicial source in the French 
capital said all the men targeted today were thought to be members of a 
secretive Salafist group.

Referring to another Paris suburb, the
source said: 'A prosecutor in Pontoise was recently withdrawn from the 
case and replaced with an anti-terrorist prosecutor in Paris. It was him
who sanctioned this morning's raids.

'Armed police visited a number of 
addresses across the country in coordinated raids. The suspect in 
Strasbourg tried to resist arrest by firing at officers who had stormed 
into his home.'

The raids were coordinated by the Central Directorate of Internal Intelligence (DCRI) and the terrorism sub-directorate (SDAT) of the Judicial Police.

The source said that a gunman arrested in Paris had been acting in a 'threatening and dangerous manner' but was quickly disarmed with no injuries.

An Interior Ministry spokesman said raids had today (sat) taken place at addresses in cities all over the country, and notably in Nice, Cannes, and Paris. He said there had been seven arrests in all.

Police have been on heightened alert since the attacks by Merah, who was himself finally shot dead by police.

Merah had strong links to Salafist groups in the Toulouse area, where he was brought up, and there are fears that they may have assisted his murderous crimes.
