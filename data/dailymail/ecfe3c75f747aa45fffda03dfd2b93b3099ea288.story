These pictures show how a drunk father got his seven-year-old son to drive him 15 miles home after a drinking session in China.

Jun Yu was sent to pick up his father after he passed out near his regular drinking den in the city of Yizhou in southern China's Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region.

Officers were alerted to the images after they went viral when they were posted by a stunned motorist who saw the child driving.

The pictures show the youngster driving a three-wheeled vehicle with his father slumped in the trailer behind him. 

It has been reported that the child's mother dispatched him to collect his father after she was told he had passed out.

According to neighbours, it is not the first time Jun Yu has acted as a taxi driver for his father. 

Chinese police have confirmed that the images of the youngster driving are genuine.

Officers confirmed that they had spoken to the parents and were considering charges for allowing the boy to drive the vehicle while under age.

A police spokesman said: 'The child drove a total of 20km to bring his father home. His father was incapacitated after a night of drinking with friends at a bar near his place of work.'

The legal age for driving in China is 18 although in many rural areas it is largely ignored as children help parents with farm work and often drive farm vehicles similar to the three-wheeled truck.

The images sparked widespread criticism of the father, but praise for the seven-year-old boy's driving skills.
