A Buddhist monk is moving to Loch Ness to be closer to the legendary monster after fleeing Tibet with the Dalai Lama.

Lama Yeshe Losal Rinpoche wants to open an inter-faith peace and healing centre, practising yoga, tai chi and Buddhist teachings by the water’s edge at one of Britain’s favourite tourist spots.

Local businesses and tourism groups have welcomed the plan with ‘open arms’ to boost the Highland economy while Lama Yeshe hopes to get a glimpse of Nessie.

Fascinated with Loch Ness legend: Lama Yeshe Losal Rinpoche (right) plans to open an inter-faith peace and healing centre in Loch Ness because he believes there 'could be such a thing or something like' the Loch Ness monster (left, a depiction of the creature on exhibition)

Lama Yeshe runs health centres around the world, including the famous Samye Ling Monastery in Dumfriesshire, Scotland.

He said today: ‘When I first came to Scotland I remember watching these people searching for the Loch Ness monster.

Epic journey: Lama Yeshe fled Tibet with the 14th Dalai Lama (pictured) in 1959 and endured a 15-day journey on foot over Himalayan Mountains to India

‘I always wanted to know if they would find something. For me, I believe there could be such a thing or something like it.’

Lama Yeshe fled Tibet with the 14th 
Dalai Lama in 1959 to escape the Chinese suppression of the national 
uprising and remains close to the iconic spiritual leader.

The
men endured an epic 15-day journey on foot from the Tibetan capital, 
Lhasa, over the Himalayan Mountains to India where the Dalai Lama 
denounced the People's Republic and established a Tibetan government in 
exile.

The new facility will feature a special gift blessed by the Dalai Lama, a 12ft peace pole, made from Lochaber oak, which has the inscription ‘May Peace Prevail on Earth’ in Tibetan, in his handwriting, and in English and Gaelic.

While Lama Yeshe would not disclose the exact location of the planned centre it is believed the centre could be based in Drumnadrochit. He said they were in discussions with owners of a potential site, which had previously been used as a healing centre.

The centre will be open to everyone and aims to build inter-faith relations in Scotland. 

He said: ‘The main reason for the centre is because there is something missing here.’

The lama said his centre on Holy Isle, near Arran, generated new businesses for local shops and guesthouse owners.

Famous teaching: Lama Yeshe runs health centres around the world including the Samye Ling Monastery (pictured is its entrance-way) in Dumfriesshire, Scotland

Blessed gift: Lama Yeshe remains close with the Dalai Lama, who has blessed a special 12ft peace pole that will feature at the new facility

He said: ‘In Arran, we have many 
tourists from all over the world staying there. This helps the people of
Arran, like guesthouses.

‘They don’t just come to the centre and leave, they stay to see Arran.’

Lama Yeshe also said the group was looking for a building in Inverness where they could run classes and have soup runs. 

He said: ‘We are trying to provide a service that, in this financially strained time, the council cannot.

Graham Ambrose, of marketing group Destination Loch Ness, said: ‘If it brings more people from around the world to Loch Ness from different countries that we don’t usually get, that can only be a good thing.

‘And if people stayed on in the local B&Bs, that would benefit everyone. 

‘It would be good particularly in the winter months when the area is at its most peaceful.’

Businessman Willie Cameron, who owns Loch Ness Marketing, said he would welcome the Tibetan group with ‘open arms’. 

He said: ‘I know in other parts of the country this group has blended in very well in the community and have done a lot of good work.’
