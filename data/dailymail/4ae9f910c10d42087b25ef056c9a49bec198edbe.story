A peer jailed for fiddling his expenses has been caught ‘clocking in’ to the House of Lords for barely half an hour a day to claim his £300 daily attendance fee.

But yesterday Lord Hanningfield defended himself saying that ‘at least half’ of all peers were also abusing the allowance system – before going even further and claiming: ‘They all do it.’

During July, Lord Hanningfield was monitored clocking in for as little as 21 minutes a day to register for his fee. On 11 out of 19 days, for which he claimed £5,700, he spent fewer than 40 minutes in Parliament.

The left-hand picture shows Lord Hanningfield arriving at Westminster station at 14.36, ahead of walking to the Palace of Westminster. The right-hand picture shows him getting back on the tube less than half an hour later

And last night, Lord Hanningfield – who was expelled from the Tory Party after being jailed in 2011 over the expenses scandal – faced the prospect of a police investigation after Labour MP John Mann made a formal complaint to Scotland Yard. Mr Mann said: ‘No reasonable person could describe what he is doing as parliamentary work.

‘There are clearly issues here that need investigation by the police.

‘It is potentially not just immoral behaviour. I’m sure the police will want to investigate him.’

But Lord Hanningfield yesterday defended his right to claim his fee for such short spells in Parliament, and tried to draw other members of the House of Lords into the scandal. He said: ‘I could say the whole 600 sometimes just go in to clock in. A lot of the MPs, because they get salaries, don’t go in at all. At least we have to go in.

‘Being a Lord is not just going in to 
the House of Lords. It’s the post you have. I have 15 letters a day. I 
have all sorts of things like that. I can do some of it at home, I can 
do some of it at my office in the Lords.’

Lord
 Hanningfield was caught by undercover reporters from the Daily Mirror, 
who monitored his parliamentary activity during July.

'The whole 600 sometimes just go in to clock in': Lord Hanningfield tried to defend his behaviour by saying it was commonplace among his colleagues

But speaking outside his £700,000 home in Essex yesterday, he said: ‘I’ve done nothing wrong, I’ve been doing my work. I double-check with the finance department all the time. I don’t have this money myself, I give it to other people. I’ve never made a penny out of my public work.’

Yesterday the Prime Minister’s official spokesman said David Cameron had been ‘dismayed’ by the revelation about Lord Hanningfield, and leader of the Lords, Lord Hill, said that peers found to be exploiting the daily allowance system would be banned from Parliament.

Despite being jailed for nine months over the expenses scandal, Lord Hanningfield was allowed back in the House of Lords and has claimed nearly £51,300 in allowances between April 2012 and July 2013. During that time he did not make any speeches in the Lords chamber. Since October, Lord Hanningfield has spoken twice and submitted four written questions.

He told the BBC: ‘Doing work in the Lords is not just working in the chamber, unless you are going to speak. During July I was preparing myself for what I’m doing now, and during this term I’ve been speaking and asking questions. I’m really back to an active life in politics and I don’t appreciate the Mirror following me around in July.’

The former Essex County Council leader claimed he spent half of the £300 daily fee on expenses and so did not really make any profit. He was a full-time peer who needed the money to pay his electricity bills and buy food, he said.

He added: ‘You have to go in to get the allowances but you do most of your work not in the Chamber.’

He also claimed he was writing his 
memoirs to set the record straight about how he was ‘wrongly charged and
 wrongly convicted’ of expenses fraud.

Yesterday,
 Lord Hill told the Lords that party leaders were ‘dismayed about the 
shadow it casts over the whole House’. He told peers that there would be
 a new sanction to withdraw financial support and access to facilities 
for Lords who breach a code of conduct which is expected to be 
introduced in the new year.

Lord Hill also called for the code of conduct to be tightened up to take action against those who ‘bring the House into disrepute’.

A backbench bill brought forward by Tory MP Dan Byles would also allow the permanent expulsion of members of the Lords who commit serious criminal offences.

Lord Oakeshott criticised the system that allowed convicted peers to continue sitting in the Lords.

‘You can stroll out of the prison gates in the morning and into the Lords after lunch and claim your allowances,’ he told Sky News.

‘That is, I think, completely unacceptable that we have a system of convicted criminals sitting in the Lords and voting on our laws. We need the whole place to be cleaned up, we need it elected, we need half the number of people, the whole thing is a mess.’

The Electoral Reform Society, which has campaigned for an elected House of Lords, said: ‘When people look at the House of Lords, they see an outdated institution which bears no relation to their own experiences. It’s no wonder people feel alienated from politics when they see peers clocking on for £300 a day and clocking off shortly after. After all, who’d be able to get away with that in normal life?’

There are currently 779 ‘eligible’ members of the House of Lords. More than 40 other peers have taken a ‘leave of absence’ for health or professional reasons, meaning they cannot attend. A retirement scheme was introduced in 2011 to encourage peers no longer attending to step down voluntarily, but so far only three peers have used it.
