Works: Buttocks, thighs and core

Just imagine going to bed and then waking up in the morning weighing a couple of pounds less. It sounds like the dieting miracle millions have been waiting for but it's one a new book claims is now possible to achieve.

Last week we serialised an exciting new slimming plan by U.S. weight-loss expert, Dr Caroline Apovian. Her Overnight Diet claims you can lose up to 9lb every week by sticking to one non-food day (in which you drink homemade smoothies and drop 2lb as you sleep) and then six days of eating foods which diets usually ban - including potatoes and peanut butter.

The secret to its success lies in doing everything you can to preserve muscle. We all lose muscle mass as we age - at the rate of one per cent a year from the age of 30 - and dieting can make this worse.

When the body detects a significant drop in food intake it looks to your muscles for extra energy. This means you get thinner - but you also get weaker and flabbier when the weight creeps back on as fat  as it does for 95 per cent of dieters.

Last week we showed the smoothie recipes that will keep you feeling full on the no-food day and outlined the eating rules to abide by. If you missed it you can find this first part by searching for 'overnight diet' at dailymail.co.uk.

Today, in the final part of our exclusive serialisation, we explain how a quick and simple exercise regime done just a few days each week is the most effective way to keep your body in the best shape it can be.

The government recommends you find 30 minutes each day for fitness to maintain your weight and 90 minutes a day if you want to start shifting the pounds. But who has the time and inclination - especially if you're on a diet and feeling hungry - to do that?

In fact, Dr Apovian is convinced the exercise recommendations of not just the government but also many popular diets could actually be preventing you from reaching your weight-loss goals.

'For decades, diets have been promoting aerobic exercise as the best way to burn calories and shed pounds,' she says. 'But the combination of very low-calorie diets with hours of cardiovascular exercise may put the body into a catabolic state in which it robs the muscles for fuel.'

Instead, Dr Apovian has devised a short, sharp exercise plan which will not just maintain the muscle you do have but also add more - so speeding up your metabolism - without bulking you up.

This workout plan is based on a growing body of research that shows combining resistance training with short bursts of cardiovascular activity burns far more body fat than doing the two separately. In short you get double the impact in half the time. She recommends doing it four times a week.

The easy-to-follow exercises outlined here strengthen nearly every major muscle group in the body while improving balance and flexibility. And you don't have to join a gym or invest in any special equipment; you can do Dr Apovian's 21 minute workout any time, anywhere - so there are no excuses!

The Overnight Diet Workout

Worls: Calves, thighs, hips, buttocks and abdominals

Start each session with a three-minute 'dynamic warm-up'. The aim is to warm up the muscles all around your body and raise your heart rate.

So, run through various vigorous leg and arm moves - marching on the spot bringing your knees up high; then take your legs behind you, kicking your bottom with your heels as you march; swing your leg from side to side, moving your arms above and around your head as you do so.

Then, with one eye on a stop-watch, start doing the strength-training exercises (outlined in the box to the right) in two-minute blasts interspersed with one-minute bursts of aerobic activity called 'rev-up blasts'.

These 60-second blasts are designed to get your heart pumping - try fast walking, marching on the spot, or sprinting fast (depending on your fitness levels), running up and down steps, star jumps, or, if you are already quite fit, 'toe touch jumps' (raise both arms above your head, then crouch down and touch your toes, then jump as you bring them up over your head again and repeat).

Each strength-training exercise is designed to work on one group of muscles at a time - from the buttocks, legs and tummy, to your chest and arms - concentrating on the biggest muscle groups for maximum impact.

The important thing is to move quickly without taking any breaks, and vary your selection of exercises each time to keep different muscle groups working. Start at the simplest level, but adjust the difficulty as you get fitter and stronger (you'll know as soon as the exercise starts to feel easy and this will be quicker than you think!).

These easy moves can help you tone up forever, according to the Overnight Diet

Works: Buttocks, rear thighs and lower back

Keep the weight off long term

If you follow the Overnight Diet diligently you could lose as much as 9lb in a week, more than a stone in two weeks, and, if you stick to the plan, you could even be 2½st lighter by this time next month.

When you reach your ideal weight - which will be sooner than you think - it is very important not to simply revert to your old, bad dietary habits once you can comfortably get into your skinny jeans again.

Dr Apovian's studies show it is easy to maintain your new shape if you commit to always getting your daily protein allowance (which we explained how to work out last week) and regular muscle-strengthening exercise sessions.

It is then up to you how you choose to modify the once a week smoothie day by either:

You can also tweak your six-day plan to include a variety of foods such as:
