Twelve years ago James Simpson-Daniel lit up Twickenham with a string of dazzling displays which should have seen him running out on Saturday with 100 caps to his name.

But James Simpson-Daniel will never run again. He is not even sure how long he will be able to play with his kids in the garden.

Four shoulder operations, a shattered clavicle and four ankle surgeries since that memorable autumn of 2002 have finally done for the man they call Sinbad.

The former rugby star says his retirement 'was like a bereavement' and he will be unable to run ever again

The last injury - a horrific fracture-dislocation of his left ankle sustained last November - forced him to call time on a brilliant, but ultimately unfulfilled, 13-year professional career.

‘I still haven’t come to terms with it fully,’ the 32-year-old said. ‘I went through so much rehab and got so close but in the end every time I tried to run I got this hot sensation and just had to stop. I think I went to the pub after I was told to call it a day. The tears came randomly in the middle of the night a few days later. It felt like a bereavement.

‘Day-to-day life I’m all right. I can walk my dog. I can hopefully play with the kids in the garden. But in the morning and at night I’ll be hobbling around, stiff and sore. If I have a long journey and haven’t really moved I’ll be limpy. It isn’t ideal. I’m not going to be able to run again.’

The most naturally gifted player of his generation isn’t bitter. He enjoyed 13 years at Kingsholm -playing 272 games - although he has ‘many regrets’ about an international career which eventually yielded only 10 caps.

But he has joined a growing list of professionals forced to retire early through injury, and the severity of his last one is shocking, even by today’s gladiatorial standards.

‘I remember Tins (team-mate and friend Mike Tindall) standing over me - he was probably thinking I should have passed the ball - but the oxygen wasn’t working at the time. I could hear Tins shouting, “Get the f***ing oxygen”.

‘It was like a scene out of the film Any Given Sunday when the quarterback gets wiped out and he’s just tearing pieces of turf out of the ground. It was tough.

‘I didn’t need to look down because I’d felt everything. I’d heard the ligaments pop and the bone snap. I could hear all their players murmuring about how bad it was. The bone had basically shattered and cut like a dagger through the muscle inside my leg.

‘I was so drugged up. I had about five days in hospital. I was transferred from the local Gloucester hospital to London in the back of a Range Rover in a morphine haze. That was awful. Every time the car moved I could feel the bone moving against itself from side to side.’

Desperate for one more season at the top, Simpson-Daniel and Gloucester’s medical team resorted to increasingly extreme measures to try to fix his ruined left ankle.

‘The final treatment I had was called Pamidronate, which is used for cancer patients,’ he said. ‘The idea is that they pump this stuff into your arm and it travels around your body and finds the damaged area of the bone and strengthens it.’

He added: ‘It’s quite an aggressive treatment and one of the side-effects is you can get properly ill. On the train home I started having flu-like sweats. I could handle that. But when I woke up the next day my whole body was throbbing. My bones were aching.

‘Then I needed a month for the treatment to take maximum effect. I waited for a month, and even when I was lacing up my boots I thought I was going to be OK. I went out and ran, wasn’t OK, and came back in a retired rugby player.’

If things had taken a different turn, Simpson-Daniel could have appeared against South Africa at Twickenham on Saturday as a veteran star with a World Cup winner’s medal. The talent was undisputed, but his body failed him too often in rugby’s heavyweight arena.

Barely out of his teens, the former Sedbergh schoolboy was drafted into Clive Woodward’s squad in November 2002 following an eye-catching display in an uncapped international against Jonah Lomu and the Barbarians.

A memorable moment of trickery, allied to searing pace and a magnificent step, left Lomu floundering and Twickenham purring.

A full international debut victory over the All Blacks followed, before a man-of-the-match display against Australia the following week confirmed England had unearthed a gem. A year after leaving school, Simpson-Daniel had hit the big time.

‘A few months earlier I’d been at school playing “Jonah Lomu’s Rugby” on the PlayStation,’ he said. ‘Then Clive told me I was playing against him. I was terrified. Those two games were unbelievable. To beat the All Blacks and Australia in my first two matches for England in a team of legends: it was special.’

But just hours after the final whistle against Australia, it was confirmed the sickness he’d felt in the lead-up to the game was actually glandular fever. He missed the following week’s battle with South Africa before a back injury set in and he failed to make the World Cup cut by the narrowest of margins.

‘I remember watching the final with my in-laws,’ he said. ‘I cheered the boys on but when the final whistle went I had this gut-wrenching feeling. I felt sick. I knew how close I’d come to being part of it.’

Simpson-Daniel does not know what he is going to do with the rest of his life. A part share in racehorse Monbeg Dude with friends and former team-mates Tindall and Nicky Robinson is a fun distraction, but will not provide financial security for his young family.

‘I have to accept that there will never be anything out there that mirrors the sensation you get from rugby,’ he said.

‘I don’t know how I’ll be remembered. People say I could have got more caps for England. But at Gloucester they seem to like me so maybe I’ll go down as one of the good players at Gloucester.

‘Apart from that it won’t be too long until no one knows my name. That’s the point. Unless you’re Jonny Wilkinson people forget you pretty quickly. I’ll be like every other player. Forgotten soon.’
