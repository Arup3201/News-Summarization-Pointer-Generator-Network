These pictures show the dramatic aftermath of a car crash which saw a Renault flip through the air and end up balanced on a garden fence.

No one was seriously hurt in the 70mph smash, which happened early yesterday morning in an area known to be a hotspot for speeding drivers.

The teenager who was driving the car - thought to have been stolen - was arrested in the aftermath of the crash in Milton, outside Stoke-on-Trent in Staffordshire.

Smash: This Renault Clio ended up impaled on a concrete fence post following a crash yesterday morning

Escape: The two teenagers inside the car both managed to get out with only minor injuries

Residents said they saw the black Renault Clio somersault through the air at 5.10 yesterday morning.

It ended up impaled on a 6ft concrete fence post, balanced precariously on its end - but both occupants of the car were able to get out.

Images of the aftermath were captured by Clifford Beeton, a milkman who was on his morning round at the time.

'It was amazing anyone came out of the car alive,' he said. 'I was taking a break from my round and was eating a banana when this car zoomed past me at around 70mph.

'It missed my van by a matter of inches and I could see the driver staring wildly ahead.

'The next thing I head was a screech, a scrape and a bang and as I turned the car double-somersaulted through the air and landed on the fence post.

'It was like a scene out of a James Bond movie - the car seemed to fly through the air in slow motion.

'I was convinced whoever was in the car must be dead but as I approached the car the two lads in the front seats were dangling upside down by their belts.

'They managed to free themselves and stumble away. It was a miracle anyone survived.'

A female passenger was taken to the University Hospital of North Staffordshire to be treated for minor injuries.

The 19-year-old man who was behind the wheel was subsequently arrested on suspicion of stealing the vehicle, according to Staffordshire Police.

'Police were called to a report of a road traffic collision in Caton Crescent / Magnolia Drive, Stoke-on-Trent, at around 5.10am on Monday 26 May,' a spokesman said.

'A Renault Clio had been in collision with a garden wall and overturned.

'A 19-year-old man from Stoke-on-Trent was arrested nearby on suspicion of taking a motor vehicle without the owner's consent. He was released on bail pending further inquiries until a date in June.

'A 19-year-old woman from Stoke-on-Trent, believed to be a passenger, was taken to the University Hospital of North Staffordshire for treatment to minor injuries. '

Inspector Kevin Treacy added: 'A black Renault Clio left the road and ended up on its roof in the garden of a property on that road.

'The car was recovered away from the property. The fire service did go to make the vehicle stable, but there was no fire risk.'

Locals say they frequently see drivers travelling dangerously fast in the area, and have called for lower speed limits and traffic-calming measures.
