A Florida daycare teacher was arrested Thursday and charged with neglect for allegedly allowing a one-year-old child to play outside with any shoes or socks on, causing second-degree burns.

The alleged incident occurred on a 93-degree day in late June 2014.

Police say they reviewed footage from the A Step Above Childcare in Lakewood Ranch after the little boy's mother complained he came home with blisters on the bottom of his feet.

Stephany Gomez-Garrido, 27, a teacher at the center, claimed the infant didn't participate in outside activities at the school's 'waterpark' - a cemented area where sprinklers run -  because he was not wearing the proper shoes.

However the cameras showed otherwise, according to The Herald-Tribune.

Charged: Stephany Gomez-Garrido, 27, has been accused of neglect for letting a one-year-old boy in her care play outside on a hot summer day without shoes or socks on, causing second-degree burns to his feet

The boy can reportedly be seen leaving the classroom without shoes on.

While he doesn't appear to have entered the waterpark area, he was playing on a paved walking that lead to the area.

The footage then shows him returning to the classroom 30 minutes in Gomez-Garrido's arms crying, kicking and grabbing his feet.

Gomez-Garrido can be seen attending to the child, looking at his feet at least twice, before putting shoes and socks on him.

She can then be seen placing him on a seat, where he remained for the rest of the afternoon.

Police say the boy ran from the classroom at 1.42pm and was picked up by his mother at about 4pm.

Gomez-Garrido told detectives a few days later she did not let him play outside.

However she  later admitted that she was unable to tend to the infant because she was supervising other children in the waterpark and was the only teacher assigned to the area that day, according to WTSP.

Scene: The alleged neglect occurred at the A Step Above Childcare in Lakewood Ranch in late June 2014

An investigation however determined that Gomez-Garrido knew the toddler was playing on the hot surfaces outside and did nothing about it.

Police say the child needed medical attention, with his burns determined to be second-degree, and that she failed to noitify his mother.  

Gomez-Garrido is charged with neglect of a child without great bodily harm. 

She is being held without bond at the Sarasota County Jail.
