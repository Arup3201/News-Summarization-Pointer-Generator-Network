Customers normally have to queue for ages for the chance to speak to someone at their local bank.

But one RBS advisor launched her own bank delivery service when she travelled to a war veteran's home during her lunchbreak to help him following a break-in.

Louis Butler, 92, said Victoria Mowbray had restored his 'faith in human nature' by going the extra mile after burglars stole hundreds of pounds in cash from his home.

Louis Butler said his 'faith in human nature' was restored by bank worker Victoria Mowbray who went to his aid when he rang to cancel his cards after his home was burgled

When Mr Butler rang RBS customer services to cancel his stolen bank cards Ms Mowbray was so touched by his tale she drove the two miles to his home and rang bank colleagues and even the police on his behalf.

Mr Butler, who was honoured personally by King George VI for flying Lancaster Bombers during the war, said: 'The lady at the bank was great and she has restored my faith in human nature.

'She cancelled my missing bank cards and phoned the police for me so I could report the crime. She even called my daughter Angela to tell her what happened. She helped me with everything.

'It just shows the bank can help customers where it matters. I was dreading getting through to a call centre in India but to get through to someone working up the road was like a breath of fresh air.

'For her to then come over and help me was above and beyond the call of duty. I just wish more banks could operate like this when their customers need them.'

Widower Mr Butler was asleep when 
burglars broke into his home in Royton, near Oldham, Greater Manchester 
and grabbed £300 in cash, his laptop, his passport and other important 
identification and information.

He woke up to find his desk drawer tipped out and flung to the floor and his back door left wide open.

His
Distinguished Flying Medal, received from King George VI in 1943 for 
his service as a wireless operator who took part in bombing raids over 
Germany, was only saved as he had given it to his daughter for safe 
keeping.

Mr Butler said: 'I was shaken when I woke up and saw everything had been taken.

'My desk was open and the drawers were all out and so was the draw in the table in the hall.

'They took my laptop, my folder with all my phone numbers and important letters and bills, my passport - everything that they could get their hands on. They also took £300 out of a cash jar that I have in the desk.

'I didn't know what to do until I found the phone number for the Royal Bank of Scotland customer services, so I rang them. A nice lady answered and I was very surprised but happy that she was from my local the branch rather than from a call centre in India.

'I'm hard of hearing and knew I wouldn't understand them if I got through to someone there.

'When I told her what had happened the lady just dropped everything and came straight round to my home in her car to help me cancel my cards. I was amazed. She is so helpful. I can't thank her enough.'

Mr Butler's daughter Angela Hobson, 55, said: 'Dad was disorientated when he came downstairs to find all his stuff missing and what Victoria did shows there are some very kind people left in this world who go over and beyond what can be expected.

'Dad is well known and very well liked and people in the locality were disgusted and outraged when they found out what happened.

'It must have been obvious to whoever broke in that an old person lived there. He had his war pictures of Lancaster Bombers on the walls and a stairlift but it still didn't stop them.'

Ms Mowbray, who works in the Shaw branch in Oldham, Greater Manchester, said: 'I don't think I have done anything special.

'When he rang the bank, I didn't even know if he was a customer of ours or not. He was saying he was a 92-year-old man and he had been robbed.

'He said he had gone downstairs and they had taken everything. I was worried there was no-one at home with him and I couldn't have that on my mind, especially if he was in shock.

'I told my manager I needed to go even if it was my lunch. I helped him cancel all his cards and I called the police on the way to the house.

'When I got to his house I recognised him, and realised he had been a customer of the bank for a long time. I was just only too pleased to help - there are some despicable people out there.'
