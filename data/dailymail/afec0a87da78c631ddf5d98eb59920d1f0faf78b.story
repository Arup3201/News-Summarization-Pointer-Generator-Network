A Texas woman whose granddaughter was so severely beaten that she died with her spleen split in two is speaking out about her loss and the horrors endured by the 5-year-old little girl.

Shelley Flatt-Blevins of Amarillo, Texas hasn't until now publicly discussed the unthinkable things she and her son learned about Kati Earnest's gruesome murder at the hands of Tommy Castro in court--evils all perpetrated while Kati's mom Kristina watched silently.

'During the court hearing I learnt that she'd stood by and watched while evil Castro viciously beat Kati black and blue,' said Flatt-Blevins, 48.

Horrific: 5-year-old Kati Earnest was beaten to death by her mother's boyfriend with a wooden airplane she'd made in Sunday school in 2009

Grieving: Kati's grandmother Shelley Flatt-Blevins (here with her son, Kati's father Nelson) has only now revealed the horrors of learning how her little granddaughter was killed. Her pain has only deepened since. Nelson has since died, too. He was shot dead in a gun accident last year

In 2009, Tommy Castro was dating Kristina Earnest. On the night of July 4, Castro beat Kati with a wooden plane she'd made at Sunday school and then with his fists before stomping on her with his full weight.

Little Kati would later complain that she felt sick, vomit and die in the bathtub. After Kristina and Castro brought her to the hospital, they would first claim the girl--daughter to Flatt-Blevins' son Nelson--had drowned.

'I learnt from police that an autopsy on Kati's body indicated she'd died of blunt force trauma and hadn't drowned,' Flatt-Blevins said. 'I then learnt that Kristi had confessed to her own daughter's murder. I felt sick thinking about my precious little granddaughter.'

But this was before the full scope of what had occurred would come to light in Kristina's 2011 trial and this grandmother's shock would not soon subside.

Shocking: Flatt-Blevins and her son would also hear in court that Castro had become enraged with the little girl after she wet herself in the seat of his beloved Mazda sportscar

Kristina, while fingering Castro for the blame, would later recant and claim she was too fearful of the repercussions were she to stop of boyfriend from viciously beating the 5-year-old before forcing her to perform military exercises meant for grown men.

According to Flatt-Blevins, the court accepted a plea of guilty to causing injury to a child by omission from Kristina because 'they felt her first confession was false, suspected she'd been lured into admitting murder by Castro.'

'The judge jailed her for 50 years but the worst was yet to come – Castro's trial,' the grandmother said.

She said: 'I sat in court and watched that monster as he told lie after lie about Kati. He denied killing her, said he was suffering from kidney stones when she died and was 'out of it'.

On the stand, Castro (left) referred to 5-year-old Kati as 'disrespectful' and a 'liar' according to her grandmother

Victim? Kristina Earnest was initially handed a 50-year-sentence, but it was later shortened to 18 years after the court decided she, too, was a victim of Castro's abuse

'He called Kati 'disrespectful,' and a 'liar,' when he took to the stand. This was rubbish. Kati was a lovely little girl, as good as gold.'

On the day of her death, Kati had wet herself in the seat of Castro's beloved Mazda sportscar. He punished the little girl by beating her with her airplane.

He also punched her with his fist and then stood on her. 'The severe beating damaged her internal organs. He then made her carry out military exercises – exercises meant for grown men,' Flatt-Blevins said.

'It was dreadful. She must have suffered. And all the time her mum watched and did nothing.

'The court was told that later that she said, 'I feel sick', before vomiting. She then got in the bath and died.

'She was killed by the people who were meant to care for her.'

After her beating, Kati complained of feeling ill and vomited. She then got into the bathtub, where she died

Kati was found so badly beaten that her spleen had been split in two, according to her grandmother

'She was killed by the people who were meant to care for her' said Kati's grandmother. Kati is seen here as a baby
