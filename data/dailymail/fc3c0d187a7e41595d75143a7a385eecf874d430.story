A 76-year-old man in Texas recently spent nine days in jail for feeding nine strays that are said to have nine lives.

David Parton of Gainesville has been giving stray cats food for almost a decade because God told him to 'keep feeding them'.

He was arrested earlier this month after racking up $900 in fines and opted to spend nine days behind bars instead of paying.

David Parton of Gainesville, Texas, was jailed for nine days after refusing to pay fines for feeding stray cats 

A Gainesville law makes it illegal to 'make convenient food or containers of food' to feed stray animals

Parton, 76, served his time at the Cooke County Justice Center (pictured) earlier this month 

Parton was breaking a city law that makes it illegal to 'make convenient food or containers of food on any property or city street in the City of Gainesville for the purpose of feeding stray animals'. 

He had previously been cited before for failure to vaccinate cats, the Gainesville Daily Register reported. 

The feline fan said he hasn't seen the cats he was feeding since he was released from the Cooke County Justice Center and he fears they may be in trouble.

Parton claimed he wouldn't have paid the fines if he 'had a million dollars', CBS Dallas reported.

He said: 'God told me to keep feeding them and leave the consequences to him.  

'I told them I'd sit it out in jail. 

'I did, that's why I went to jail, I wouldn't pay the fine. 

'That law is not right.'

Parton, who claims God told him to feed the cats, said there is no way he would have ever paid the fines 

Parton has not seen any of the cats he was feeding since his release and he is worried about their welfare

An animal rights group, Alley Cats Allies, has hired an attorney to give legal advice to Parton 

The situation in Gainesville caught the attention of animal rights group Alley Cats Allies. 

The group has offered support to Parton and is 'working to repeal the local feeding ban so that no one in Gainesville who feeds cats will have to fear legal action, fines, or jail time'. 

Becky Robinson, president and founder of Alley Cat Allies, said: 'This is a truly disheartening miscarriage of justice.

'Compassion should not be criminalized, but that is exactly what this man was arrested for—simply providing food for cats. 

'We are proud to offer any assistance to this gentleman who provides a service to the cats and Gainesville.'

The organization hired an attorney from the Tatum Erlandson & Neu law firm for Parton, KX11 reported. 

Despite the added pressure, Gainesville police are standing by their decision to arrest Parton. 

Gainesville Chief of Police Kevin Phillips said: 'I think everyone involved in this process had tried to be as compassionate as possible.

'Our prosecutor met with him on two separate occasions, trying to work with him, really all we're looking for is compliance.'

Authorities blame feral cats in the area for offenses including destroying ceiling tiles at a business, infecting a local yard with fleas and scratching and biting an eight-year-old girl.
