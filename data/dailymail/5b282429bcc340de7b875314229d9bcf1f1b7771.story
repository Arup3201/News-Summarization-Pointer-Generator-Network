A mother brutally murdered by her jealous ex-partner was 'let down' by police who failed to attend a call just hours before she was stabbed to death, a review has found.

Jeanette Goodwin, 47, was stabbed more than 20 times by her former lover Martin Bunch at her home in Southend, Essex, in July 2011.

Bunch had stalked his ex-partner for months and was on bail for harassment when he broke into her back garden in a jealous rage with a kitchen knife.

A domestic homicide review by the Southend Community Safety Partnership has said police failed to attend a call on the day of the murder.

Mrs Goodwin called police at 2.30pm on July 24, 2011, to inform them she was being harassed by Bunch and arranged for officers to check up on her at 4.30pm.

But police failed to attend the arranged meeting and only came hours later when a panic alarm was sounded during the frenzied attack at around 7.30pm.

The report also criticised failings in the justice system after Bunch was handed conditional bail, ahead of a trial for harassment of Mrs Goodwin, just days before the deadly knife attack.

Christine Doorley, who led the review, said lessons needed to be learnt from the tragedy.

She said: 'This case shows the extremely manipulative and controlling power of a domestic violence perpetrator.

'He had an obsessional nature and past history as well as problems with drugs and alcohol. He was a really serious and dangerous perpetrator.

'The most important lesson to be learnt here is to make sure all information is recorded in real time with no backlog and shared with the right people.

'At any one time there were gaps in the transfer of information.

'The problems were in management of the perpetrator in terms of the criminal justice system.

Mrs Goodwin's family today said they hoped the findings would help prevent another tragedy

'Speaking to the family, they felt the justice process had not been right and I agree with them.

'There were mistakes with the technical knowledge and understandings of bail, bail conditions and options around sentencing.

'He did not fulfil any of his sentences and was never brought back to court for those issues.

'The family feel let down. There is evidence that process didn’t work as it should have.'

Bunch was known to police and had 79 previous convictions. He was jailed for 27 years in August 2012 for the brutal murder of the mother-of-three.

Mrs Goodwin’s family today said they hoped the findings would help prevent another tragedy.

In a statement, they said: 'We are satisfied with the findings which were made.

'Even though it will not bring our loved one back, we hope the learning and improvements which have been identified will make a difference for other victims of domestic abuse and help to ensure they will now be treated as they should, as a priority.

'We hope these findings and recommendations will help to prevent such a tragedy occurring again.'

Essex Police has said it would 'like to again extend its sincere condolences to the family and friends' of Mrs Goodwin.

It said it welcomed the recommendations highlighted by the review, adding many had already been implemented and were expected to be completed by the end of this month.

The force said it had also undertaken a range of further steps to improve its response to domestic abuse incidents in association with partner agencies in Southend and beyond.

Police failed to attend the arranged meeting at 4.30pm and only came hours later when a panic alarm was sounded during the frenzied attack at around 7.30pm

Chief Superintendent Luke Collison said: 'Much has changed since the victim's tragic death and work continues to improve the consistency and co-ordination of our response to domestic abuse.

'There is a lot being done, both inside the force, and with partners. Domestic abuse is one of the biggest challenges we face – every day we deal with an average of 80 incidents, each one quite rightly demanding a professional and effective response.

'Essex Police rightly dedicate significant resources to tackling this issue and our commitment to meeting this demand and keeping vulnerable people safe is unequivocal.

'Together with our partners we remain committed to helping victims of domestic abuse and we would urge anyone suffering at the hands of a violent offender to contact us immediately.

'Our pledge is this: "We will listen to you and we will help you".'

The force has said among the improvements made to the way it handles domestic abuse are:

Other changes include a joint initiative between police, Southend Borough Council and other partners to bring a specially trained domestic abuse 
police officer and a social worker together to assess domestic abuse 
incidents as they are reported, as well as a new Domestic Abuse Crime Unit at Southend police station to provide a
 dedicated resource for all domestic abuse investigations and prisoners.

The force said certain higher risk perpetrators are also specifically targeted by Neighbourhood Officers under Operation Shield, which it says provides a relentless attention and enforcement approach to those who pose the greatest risk to victims of domestic abuse.

In 2012 an investigation found a catalogue of police failings allowed sadistic killer David Oakes to murder his ex-partner and daughter

This is not the first time Essex Police has been accused of failing a victim of violent crime.

In 2012 an investigation found a catalogue of police failings allowed sadistic killer David Oakes to murder his ex-partner and daughter.

The police watchdog said officers took 'inadequate action' to arrest the 50-year-old before he shot Christine Chambers, 38, and Shania, two, at their home in Braintree, Essex.

Oakes, of Steeple, near Maldon, was given two whole-life jail terms after being found guilty of the murders, which happened in June 2011.

It emerged during his trial at Chelmsford Crown Court that police had visited either his address or Miss Chambers' home six times in the two years before the murders.

The trial heard that Oakes stormed Ms Chambers’ house and blasted her and their daughter Shania with a shotgun just weeks after the family gained a restraining order against him.

He then shot himself in the face, but survived.

A damning report released by the Independent Police Complaints Commission (IPCC) concluded there was a number of failings by Essex Police, including missed chances to arrest Oakes before the killings.

Responding to the report, Essex Police said it accepted the findings and apologised for the failings which had been identified.

Meanwhile, in May last year, the IPCC published a second highly critical report on the failures by Essex police to protect Maria Stubbings who was strangled by her convicted murderer ex-boyfriend.

Ms Stubbings was killed by Marc Chivers at her home in Chelmsford, Essex, in December 2008.

Chivers had been freed from a German prison less than a year earlier, after serving 15 years for murdering his then girlfriend Sabine Rappold. He was jailed for life in 2009 for Ms Stubbings' murder.

Ms Stubbings was strangled with a dog lead and dumped under coats in the toilet of her house, but police were 'fobbed off' by her killer, who said she was away, even though her car was in the drive.

It was only the next day when they came back they found her body.

Ms Stubbings's 15-year-old son Benji had been left in the house with Chivers after his mother died, unaware that he was in grave danger.

The IPCC report found there were implications for the whole force.

The report said that the force missed 'a large number of opportunities' to protect her and her son.

At the time, Essex Police said it accepted the findings of the report.

Chief Constable Stephen Kavanagh said: 'A combination of factors including missed opportunities and organisational failures led to the brutal murder of Maria Stubbings. As a force we must never lose sight of the impact of her death at the hands of a violent offender and we must respond to the IPCC report in a positive way.

'We fully recognise that this is one of three tragic murders in Essex which has led to an IPCC investigation. We have taken on board the recommendations of those reports, many are already in place and work continues to improve the consistency of our response to domestic abuse.'
