A sports student who took her final physical exam while in the early stages of labour has been awarded a first class degree.

Despite experiencing contractions, Samantha Locke performed a series of six physical exercises before going on to complete a written test.

The 23-year-old had been due to be induced the day after her last exam, a test made up of six gruelling practical exercises at Bournemouth University in Dorset.

The exercise science graduate had begun suffering from pains in her stomach from about 8am on the morning of her exam but initially put it down to nerves and arrived for the final later that day at 2.30pm.

It was not until the end of the physical test that Samantha realised she was in labour. However, she then went on to complete the theoretical section - with excruciating stomach cramps - before finally going to hospital.

Daughter Poppy was born the next day weighing 8lb 8oz following a 13-hour labour.

Graduate Samantha, who lives with partner Chris Ellis, a 28-year-old accountant, said she was delighted with both baby Poppy and her first class degree.

She said: 'I was absolutely determined to finish the exam after all of those three years of hard work.

'On the morning of the exam I did have some twinges but I just put them down to nerves. I did think it might be something to do with the baby but ignored it.

'The final exam was a practical and written exam, so I had to demonstrate how to perform six exercises for people with medical problems.

'It was funny because the problems were high blood pressure and a bad back, which I had because I was in labour. I just tried to do them slowly with no sudden movements.

'When I reached the last station I felt a definite twinge and realised what it was. Then I started to get more regular contractions.

'I just wanted to keep going because otherwise I would have had to have done it in the re-sit period in August, which would have been a nightmare with Poppy.'

The exam was the final part of her three-year course at Bournemouth University on June 7.

When Samantha's mother Angela Locke, a 51-year-old cleaner from Somerton in Somerset, realised her daughter was in labour she rushed to her side once the exam had finished.

Together, the pair waited until the contractions became more regular and drove to hospital at 11pm, once they were happening every four minutes.

Samantha finally gave birth to baby Poppy by natural delivery at 12.44pm on June 8.

She added: 'It was so surreal because I knew all my course mates had been out that night celebrating and they would all be in bed hung-over and I had just had a baby.

'I normally think about exams straight after them and worry about what I could have done better but I just forgot about it.'

Samantha and Poppy were allowed home on June 10 at 5pm and returned back to the university a month later to pick up her results.

She said: 'I was really hoping for a first but wasnâ€™t sure what I was going to get because some parts like the dissertation and final exam were quite heavily weighted.

'It was amazing when I got my results, I was so proud. I brought Poppy with me when I collected them and she slept through the whole thing, completely oblivious.'

Samantha is currently a full-time mum to Poppy but is study occupational therapy at Southampton next year.

She added: 'Hopefully my exams will be a lot less eventful this time round.'

Her mother Angela added: 'I am very proud of her university success but on top of this she has given birth to her beautiful baby girl Poppy.'
