A family has escaped unharmed after the plane they were in had to make an emergency landing on a Texas Beach.

Father Doyle Thibodeaux, his wife and their seven-year-old son were flying to Houston on Saturday when their single-engine aircraft was unable to switch to the last of four fuel tanks.

Their pilot, Brian Himel, tried to land at the nearby Scholes International Airport but was unable to make it.

Instead he was forced to land the Piper Cherokee plane on Stewart Beach, in Galveston, and luckily everyone escaped without injury.

Himel planned to fly the single-engine plane off the beach as soon as he could refuel. Galveston police and parks officials had no immediate information Sunday on plane.

Thibodeaux, his wife and their son planned to continue their trip from Patterson, La., to the Houston area by car.

Elsewhere another Piper PA-28 lost engine power while student pilot Michael Schwartz was taking two women for a tour of the Statue of Liberty on Sunday.

The quick-thinking amateur managed to safely land his plane on the Major Deegan Expressway in the Bronx without hitting any cars, and saving the lives of both passengers.

However, today in Aspen, Colorado, a pilot was killed and two others injured as a private jet flipped over and burst into flames while trying to land.

Co-pilot Sergio Carranza Brabata, from Mexico, died when the Canadair CL- 600 skidded down the right side of runway at Aspen-Pitkin County Airport, flipped and exploded about 12.30pm.

The two injured men are also reportedly Mexican pilots. They were rushed to Aspen Valley Hospital, with one in a critical condition.

The aircraft was reportedly en route to the luxury ski resort town from Toluca, Mexico via Tuscon, Arizona.

The plane is said to have attempted a few approaches before crashing in a ball of fire.

Emergency crews rushed to extinguish the flames and are currently investigating the cause of the crash.

Country singer LeAnn Rimes was among those who saw the explosion.

She tweeted: 'So sad! Horrible plane crash we just saw happen at the Aspen airport.'
