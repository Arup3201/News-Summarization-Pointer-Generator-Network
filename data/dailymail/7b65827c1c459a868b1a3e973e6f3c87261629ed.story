FIFA's credibility cannot be rescued until Sepp Blatter leaves his role as president, a former member of the world governing body's independent governance committee said on Monday.

Speaking at the International Centre for Sport Security's 'Securing Sport' conference in London, Michael Hershman, an expert in transparency, accountability and governance, called for a change of leadership at FIFA.

Blatter has been president since 1998 and last month declared his intention to run for a fifth term.

'I'd rather see more anger (towards FIFA) than cynicism,' Hershman said.

'If we're going to change organisations like FIFA, we're going to have to put pressure on the stakeholders, put pressure on the sponsors, put pressure on the federations to demand change.

'FIFA was the most difficult assignment (of my career) and probably the most unsatisfactory.

'I, at this point, don't believe FIFA will ever have enough credibility unless there is a change in leadership.'

FIFA has no plans at present to publish a report by former United States attorney Michael Garcia into the bidding process for the 2018 and 2022 World Cup tournaments.

Hershman called for it to be made public, with the names of some witness redacted to protect them.

'I would like to see FIFA release the report with appropriate protection for people's privacy,' Hershman added.

'Without the release of a report, FIFA is going to continue to be ridiculed for lack of a commitment to transparency.'

Hershman was surprised that, after a number of FIFA's executive committee spoke of the need to make the report public, a statement followed a recent meeting to declare there had been no such demands made.

'That gives you some idea of the internal pressures people face within FIFA to toe the line,' Hershman added.
