Trick: 'Bogus princess' Sarah Al Amoudi, outside the High Court at a previous hearing, and today she has been accused of faking a foreign accent to influence a judge in her £14m fraud case

A self-styled Saudi princess is being sued for £14million by former associates who say she faked a 'ridiculous' accent to bamboozle a judge in her fraud case, the High Court heard.

Sarah Al Amoudi is accused by developers Amanda Clutterbuck and Ian Paton of being an ex-prostitute who tricked them into transferring six prime London properties into her name.

They claim she posed as the daughter of a billionaire Saudi sheikh to pull off an elaborate scam.

But Al Amoudi claims her wealth and royal status is genuine, with pocket money of £100,000-a-week secretly sent from Saudi Arabia to London in suitcases by her mother.

On one occasion she said she spent £1million on perfume, and told the judge she had the receipts to prove it.

In the latest twist in a long-running legal battle, Barrister Stuart Cakebread, for Ms Clutterbuck and Mr Paton, has accused her of faking her accent in court.

Reminding Mrs Justice Asplin of the 'ridiculous pidgin English which [Miss Al Amoudi] adopted in her evidence', he said: 'I invite a finding that that was an act which she put on for your benefit.'

The so-called 'vamp in the veil' claims the string of Knightsbridge properties, which Mr Paton transferred into her name, are rightly hers in settlement of a massive debt he owed to her.

Miss Al Amoudi, who usually arrives at court in a Rolls Royce Phantom with 'HRH' registration plates, earlier told the court in evidence that she had handed large sums of money to Mr Paton, but not received all of it back.

Expensive: Al Amoudi has regularly turned up to court in a Rolls Royce with a personalised number plate, and says her royal mother sends cash stuffed in suitcases to London

She said she had regular deliveries of cash from rich relatives in Saudi Arabia, which she kept under her bed and some of which she gave to Mr Paton to look after for her.

Shrouded: Al Amoudi leaves the High Court with her retinue

Reading and writing very limited English and without a bank account, she had come to trust Mr Paton, with whom she claims to have had a long-lasting affair, more and more with her money, she said.

But Mr Cakebread told the London court today: 'It is a farrago of lies: lie upon lie upon lie to cover up the truth.'

Miss Al Amoudi, whose age is variously reported as between 30 and the mid-40s, had claimed in court that she could not reveal the name of her husband, because it might put her in danger, he continued.

'This is the most preposterous nonsense,' said the barrister.

'This is a lady who drives around in the most identifiable car in London and with bodyguards to make sure no one makes a mistake about who she is.

'It is all part of this absurd performance where she pretends to be a Saudi princess, pretends to be in danger, and that gives her exemption from answering questions that might unfortunately show she might be a liar.'

In July the mysterious ‘princess’ wept in court as she assured the judge she had never been an impoverished prostitute, that her wealth was genuine and that she had been on the shopping sprees to prove it.

Miss Al Amoudi told judge Sarah Asplin her shopping addiction was so serious she had sought medical help.

In heavily accented English, Miss Al Amoudi said: ‘I have a problem with shopping – I go to doctor. In the last two months my perfume, only the perfume – $1.4million (£912,000). I can show you the pictures.’

Miss Al Amoudi arrived at court in a full burka and five-inch platform heels.

At the suggestion of the judge she removed her veil in the witness box, but still attempted to keep her face hidden from onlookers.

She claims she had an affair with her alleged victim Mr Paton, 45, behind the back of his lover and business partner Ms Clutterbuck, 56, and that he borrowed and stole some £5million of pocket money she received from Saudi Arabia.

Giving evidence in the summer, Mr Paton denied having an affair with Miss Al Amoudi.

The hearing continues.
