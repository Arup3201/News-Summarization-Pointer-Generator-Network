The latest milk crazes have been those such as coconut or maybe even almond milk, but one other new alternative is taking the country by storm and offering significant health benefits, although you will have to fork out a little bit more.

Camel milk is the oldest milk that human beings have been utilising across the globe but here in Australia it's a relatively whole new idea.

A Queensland dairy has just received Safe Food accreditation to sell pasteurised camel milk, referred to as 'white gold' to the public from their farm on the Sunshine coast, one of just two in Australia, the other being in Western Australia.

Q Camel director Lauren Brisbane says they have purchased a number of years in past years and have been putting together the dairy this year, to establish a quality business.

'We just currently got a processor to process the milk,' she said.

'I've been selling milk for about eight years but I took the science approach (for camel milk) because we enjoy doing it and it offers great benefits to the public.'

Camel milk is :

*Higher in vitamin C (x5 of cow milk)

*Higher in iron (x10) potassium, magnesium

*Higher in calcium

*Higher ratio of omega 3 to omega 6

*Contains no beta-lactoglobulin (allergy senstive - lower in lactose)

*Lower cholestrol 

Ms Brisbane embarked on a two year research project to look at selling camel milk in Australia and started studying it's many benefits and why it's so healthy.

'There's been enormous amounts of research on it, 40 years worth. 6,000 years they've (camels) been domesticated and it's been ignored here because it's primarily in North Africa and the Middle East,' she said.

The difficulty in milking camels in Australia is that they're not used to it, the animals have been predominantly wild for the last 100 years.

'Training camels to milk is no mean feat, you have to train them because there's no history of milking and they have to trust you.'

Camel milk has significant health benefits for children with autism, those with diabetes and intestinal problems, as well as allergies

'Not every camel are suitable for milking, it depends on the animal and personality, some animals can be difficult.'

Ms Brisbane says there is a lot of hard work involved in milking camels because you have to make sure they are looked after or they won't produce.

'You've got to spend time looking after the babies as well as the mothers.' 

All those factors, including training for staff and even for vets into the new industry, contribute to extremely high production costs which will see those buying it, have to fork out $25, just for a litre.

And you won't get much milk out of each camel per day, with the average at about 5 Litres or 10 if you're lucky.

'That price is common around the world,' said Ms Brisbane, 'even Dubai where the labor is cheaper, they can't produce it for under $15 a litre.'

'In the states it goes fro anywhere up to $40 a litre.'

Chair of the Australian Camel Industry Association, Ms Brisbane says while these animals have been regarded as feral pests in Australia, they are really quite useful to farming operations.

'Wise farmers use them and co graze them with cattle, wonderful to increase cattle wage, help manage land, they eat weeds.'

And while one wouldn't think the demand for camel milk is very high, in fact there's a waiting list for this special type of milk because it's been proven scientifically to have numerous benefits for a number of conditions.

'There's proven scientific evidence that it can be utilised for children with autism, there's absolutely dramatic results,' she said.

Camel milk has also been proven to have significant changes in controlling diabetes and for intestinal problems.

'There's no comparison to normal milk.'

The Australian Camel Industry Association states that camel milk is capable of healing and it has been proven by nomadic cultures in the Middle East and Africa who use camel milk exclusively

Camel milk is higher in Vitamin C than cows milk, it's also higher in calcium, lower in lactose and cholestrol

The Australian Camel Industry Association states that camel milk is capable of healing and it has been proven by nomadic cultures in the Middle East and Africa who use camel milk exclusively.

It is said to also heal food allergies as well as seasonal allergies because the antibodies that camel milk contains are highly anti viral and anti bacterial.

The association says it's been found to heal ADD and ADHD or other learning challenges that can often be directly related back to gut issues.

But one of the most important things of all when producing a new product for people to consume is undoubtedly the taste and apparently there's not a lot of difference to your usual cow milk, just a little bit saltier.

'(comes down to)What we feed our animals, healthy animals produce a better product, desert animals more watery milk, our milk is creamy , pure pure white, low in fat, no heavy feeling when you drink it, much easier to digest, more compatible with the digestive system,' said Ms Brisbane.

'I think it will become popular with people who are health conscious, just half a cup to a cup a day is all you need and it really makes a difference.'

While Q Camel has only just over 30 camels on its dairy farm now, those numbers are growing with a lot of their animals now pregnant.

The dairy are trying to build up their herd because they don't start milking the mothers until a baby is two months old.

A walking encyclopaedia when it comes to the camel industry, Ms Brisbane says she loves the industry because camels are such a lovely animal.

'We have names for all our camels, every one looks different, and I can tell them all apart.'

As for whether she has a favourite!

'Of course (hahahaha) a couple melt your heart, they're good to walk up to, very gentle, beautiful, highly intelligent, working with them is the easiest.'
