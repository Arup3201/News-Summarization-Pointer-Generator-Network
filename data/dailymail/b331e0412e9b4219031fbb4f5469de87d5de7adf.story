It was fight night at the Charlotte Motor Speedway rally when two drivers began fighting between two trucks after the race.

Tension between drivers Matt Kenseth and Brad Keselowski reached a boiling point in the aftermath of Saturday night's event. 

Kenseth, who struggled for large portions of the race and was penalized by NASCAR before the start for an unapproved adjustment made to his car, was incensed that Keselowski hit his car on pit road after the checkered flag. 

Kenseth had already taken off his seatbelts and lowered his window net, and he felt the contact from Keselowski could have caused injury.

Kenseth quickly approached Keselowski from behind and nearly tackled him. He had Keselowski wrapped in his arms when crew members quickly peeled him off, and Keselowski crew chief Paul Wolfe pulled Kenseth out of the scrum in what appeared to be a choke hold.

There is no room for error in the Chase, and a bad night will put a driver on the brink of elimination.

'If you want to talk about it as a man, try to do that,' Kenseth said.

For his part, Keselowski said the hit on Kenseth was warranted because Kenseth had driven across his nose under a caution with six laps remaining. 

That contact caused front-end damage that Keselowski believed contributed to his 16th-place finish. The two had an earlier incident while racing for the lead when Kenseth was squeezed into the wall while he attempted to pass Keselowski.
