US Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg has been released from the hospital after having a heart stent implanted to clear a blocked artery.

The 81-year-old jurist was sent home Thursday and is expected to be at work when the court hears its next round of oral arguments on Monday, according to a spokeswoman.

Ginsburg was rushed to MedStar Washington Hospital Center late Tuesday after experiencing discomfort during exercise with a personal trainer.

Ginsburg has had a series of health problems, including colorectal cancer in 1999 and pancreatic cancer in 2009.

She has rejected suggestions from some liberals that she should step down and give President Barack Obama a chance to name her successor.

She was appointed to the court by President Bill Clinton in 1993.
