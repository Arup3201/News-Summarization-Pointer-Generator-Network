An ingredient in red wine called resveratrol can lead to developmental abnormalities in the foetal's pancreas if consumed in pregnancy, a study shows

Pregnant women who have the odd drink should avoid red wine, researchers suggest.

They say that an ingredient in the wine that is normally viewed as healthy could harm their unborn child's pancreas.

Resveratrol has been credited with having protective effects against heart disease, cancer, Alzheimer's disease and a number of other conditions.

Naturally present in red wine, red grapes and some berries, it is also available as a supplement.

However, a study now suggests it can lead to developmental abnormalities in the foetal pancreas. 

The study was carried out by the Division of Diabetes, Obesity and Metabolism and the Division of Reproductive and Development Science at Oregon Health and Science University in the United States.

Lead researcher on the study Dr Kevin Gove said: 'This study has direct relevance to human health. 

'Resveratrol is widely used for its recognised health benefits, and is readily available over the counter.

'The important message in this study is that women should be very careful about what they consume while pregnant, and they should not take supplements, like Resveratrol, without consulting with their doctors.

'What might be good for the mother may not be good for the baby.'

As part of the study, Dr Grove and colleagues gave resveratrol supplements every day throughout pregnancy to obese macaque monkeys eating a Western diet. 

A second group of obese monkeys was not given the supplement, and both were compared with lean monkeys fed a healthy diet.

The animals were closely monitored for health complications, and blood flow through the placenta was determined by ultrasound.

The study, which was carried out on monkeys by researchers at the Oregon Health and Science University in the U.S., found that the consumption of resveratrol during pregnancy has 'a direct relevance to human health'

The foetuses were analysed for developmental abnormalities, and findings showed definitive evidence of pancreatic abnormalities.

The study was published in the Federation of American Societies for Experimental Biology Journal.  

Dr Gerald Weissmann, editor-in-chief of the journal, said: 'We've known for a long time that resveratrol is pharmacologically active, and we're just now really beginning to understand the pros and cons of consuming high concentrations of this substance.

'As we begin to establish a safety profile for resveratrol and other dietary supplements, findings like this should come as no surprise. 

'There are always negative side effects when you eat, drink, take or do too much of anything.'
