It’s official, Raheem Sterling is England’s best player. He started with a reputation as a dribbler, but his speed, link-up play and movement makes him such a threat. 

And it was good to see Sterling and Daniel Sturridge doing what they do for Liverpool on a weekly basis.

Sturridge goes at defenders whenever he can, runs off the back of people and if he can’t get past he’ll look for a one-two. Sterling is good at moving into the space Sturridge vacates and the pair linked up well all night.

England start to shape up

I was pleased with the general shape of the team on Wednesday night. On paper it looked like 4-4-2 but Sterling and Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain were given licence to come in off the line. 

It’s so easy for wide men to stick to their wings, and England have been crying out for flexibility. 

On Wednesday night there were promising signs, now they just have to increase the number of shots on goal.

Save energy for Switzerland 

At one stage on Wednesday night I was slightly worried the side might be expending too much energy. 

We are a proud nation trying to make amends after a poor World Cup, but the game that matters this week is the qualifier against Switzerland on Monday. 

With 65 minutes on the clock, we still had a few players charging around and after weeks of intensive club football that can take its toll. Roy made his substitutions in the nick of time. 

Time for a new midfield generation

With England no longer able to call on Steven Gerrard and Frank Lampard, the next generation need to make their mark in the middle. 

Both were exceptional servants for England, but Jack Wilshere and Henderson both looked as if they were playing with a greater freedom in their absence. 

Henderson was hitting his passes with a real punch — he made more in the first half than the entire Norway midfield — and Wilshere was going at and past people in a way we haven’t seen for more than a year.
