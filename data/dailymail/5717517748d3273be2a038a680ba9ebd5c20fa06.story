An estimated 26.5 million U.S. viewers watched Germany defeat Argentina to win the World Cup on Sunday - making it the most-viewed soccer game in American history.

The tournament, which far exceeded expectations for interest across TV networks, had 17.3 million viewers on ABC and 9.2 million on the Spanish-language Univision, the Nielson company said.

In addition, just over 750,000 people 
were watching the game during a typical minute online through services 
provided by each network.

The month-long tournament was also 
responsible for more than three billion interactions on Facebook and 672 
million messages on Twitter, the social media companies said on Monday.

The 2010 finale between Spain and the Netherlands, along with the U.S. team's 2-2 draw against Portugal earlier in this year's tournament, both had 24.7 million viewers.

Given the growing interest in the tournament as it went along, the size of the audience for the final game wasn't that big a surprise, said Scott Guglielmino, ESPN senior vice president of programming.

The tournament as a whole exceeded expectations for ESPN, and surprised Guglielmino in the way it permeated U.S. culture as no World Cup has before.

1. Germany vs. Argentina 2014 World Cup final, Sunday, July 13: 27.280 million viewers on ABC, Univision and online

2. United States vs. Portugal 2014 World Cup group stage, Sunday, June 22: 26.035 million viewers on ESPN, Univision and online

3. Netherlands vs. Spain 2010 World Cup final, Saturday, July 10, 2010: 24.7 million viewers on ABC and Univision

4. United States vs. Belgium 2014 World Cup round of 16, Tuesday July 1: 23.771 million viewers on ESPN, Univision and online

5. United States vs. Ghana 2010 World Cup round of 16, Saturday, June 26, 2010: 19.4 million viewers on ABC and Univision

The average viewership for all 64 
World Cup matches was up 39 per cent over 2010 on ESPN and its sister 
station ABC, and 34 per cent on Univision, Nielsen said.

'We all knew that everything was in 
place to be well-delivered to the audience and we needed a good 
performance by the teams, and that happened,' said Juan Carlos 
Rodriguez, Univision sports president.

At
 least until some cautious games in the knockout round, play was more 
wide-open with increased scoring and that was appealing to viewers, the 
executives said.The event also had stories that transcended the games 
itself, with Uruguay's Luis Suarez suspended for biting another player 
and host Brazil's historic meltdown against Germany.

On ESPN, tournament games averaged 4.56 million television viewers, compared to the 1.04 million viewers for games in the 2002 World Cup that were in Korea and Japan.

World Cup organizers FIFA said that more than a billion fans worldwide accessed information about the tournament through its digital platforms. 'This has been the first truly mobile and social World Cup,' said FIFA President Sepp Blatter.

Facebook said 88 million people made a
 total of 280 million posts or 'likes' about the final game. The most 
social 'moment' of the tournament on Facebook, however, was right after 
Germany scored four goals in seven minutes during its semifinal victory 
against Brazil.

On Twitter, the Brazil-Germany match exceeded the final game for most tweets.

Both
 ESPN and Univision invested heavily to make the tournament an immersive
 experience, signing up former players for hours of discussion between 
match times.

Univision went 
high-tech, with virtual reality displays that pitted famed players from 
different eras against one another. The company also worked with an 
Israeli company to invest in technology that allowed its feed of games 
to appear on the network some five or six seconds before its 
English-speaking rival.

'We're the real home of soccer in America, regardless of language,' Rodriguez said.

He predicted that ratings for the Copa America Centenario tournament in 2016, which will match the best teams in North and South America, will exceed this year's World Cup on his network.

The ratings performance was a little bittersweet for ESPN and Univision, however. Both networks were outbid for the rights to broadcast the 2018 World Cup in Russia.

So there was a little gamesmanship involved. Guglielmino said the intention was to create a 'high bar' for Fox when it broadcasts the 2018 tournament. Given that the games in Russia will take place at inconvenient times in the U.S. market, Fox may be hard-pressed to beat these ratings.

'At the end of the day, a lot of us are just as competitive as some of the people we cover,' Guglielmino said.
