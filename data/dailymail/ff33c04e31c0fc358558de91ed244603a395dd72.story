Anna Soubry said of Ukip supporters: 'Some have prejudices, some are frankly racist, but there are many who just don't know the argument'

A senior Tory sparked a fresh row about immigration yesterday after branding some of her own constituents 'racist' for raising concerns about it.

Defence minister Anna Soubry, who is tipped for promotion to the Cabinet, said many voters were ignorant about its 'hugely important' benefits – while others were 'frankly racist'.

UKIP last night seized on the remarks as evidence that senior Tories still fail to understand public anger over the issue.

Miss Soubry's comments came as Chancellor George Osborne suggested David Cameron would fail to keep his pledge to cut net immigration to the 'tens of thousands' because of the difficulty of controlling the numbers arriving from Europe.

She added to doubts about whether the target would be hit – but called on the Tory leadership to be more positive about the benefits of immigration, claiming migrants come to Britain 'overwhelmingly to work – they do not come here to scrounge'.

Miss Soubry, who is defending a majority of just 389 in her hyper-marginal constituency in Broxtowe, Nottinghamshire, told the BBC's Andrew Marr show: 'When you make the case with people who come and see me in my constituency surgery who say, "I'm really worried about immigration" you say really, why?

'This is Broxtowe. We don't have a problem with immigrants. When you explain that to them, they get it. Not all of them – some people have prejudices, some people are frankly racist, but there are many who just don't know the argument.'

Her comments carry echoes of the row during the last election, when former PM Gordon Brown was forced to apologise to Rochdale pensioner Gillian Duffy after being caught on a microphone branding her a 'bigoted woman'.

Ms Soubry was forced to apologise to Nigel Farage for an attack on live TV

Anna Soubry’s intervention comes just months after she was forced to apologise to Nigel Farage for an attack on live TV.

The former TV presenter said the UKIP leader ‘looks like somebody has put their finger up his bottom and he really rather likes it’ during an appearance on the BBC’s Andrew Marr Show.

Miss Soubry, who was selected for David Cameron’s controversial A-list of  candidates before the last election, is no stranger to controversy.

While campaigning, she said she was ‘ashamed’ to live in Nottingham because of its high crime rate.

Despite this, she seized the marginal seat of Broxtowe, in Nottinghamshire, from Labour with a majority of just 389.

Miss Soubry’s no-nonsense style has won admirers in government and  seen her rise swiftly through the ranks.

But it has also led to a number of controversies. Following her appointment as a health minister in 2012 she indicated she backed assisted suicide for the terminally ill.

And she also hit the headlines for suggesting the poor are more likely to be obese because of an ‘abundance of bad food’ in their homes.

UKIP MEP Louise Bours last night called Miss Soubry's remarks 'appallingly arrogant', adding: 'The political establishment has tried to close down debate about immigration for years by branding people racists for raising legitimate concerns.

'Just when you think a genuine, moderate debate about immigration is getting underway a Tory minister starts calling her own constituents racist.

'It is such a terrible, superior attitude to say to your own voters that if you don't agree with me, you're a racist.'

Labour MP John Mann said Miss Soubry was out of touch with voters' concerns about immigration.

The MP for Bassetlaw, Nottinghamshire, said: 'The vast majority of people in Nottinghamshire who raise concerns about immigration are neither racist nor bigoted.

'Their concern is about jobs, pay and pressure on public services.'

Miss Soubry acknowledged concerns about the impact of mass immigration on public services such as schools and hospitals in some parts of the country, but said the problem was overblown.

'There are far fewer immigrants claiming benefit than there are people who have been born and bred in our country. That's the debate we need to have,' she said.

Mr Osborne yesterday appeared to admit defeat on Mr Cameron's pre-election pledge to cut net immigration to less than 100,000 by next year.

He said the 'ambition' remained in place, but suggested it could only be achieved by negotiating a deal to curb EU immigration after the next election.

Meanwhile, former Liberal Democrat leader Lord Ashdown said the party was likely to block Tory proposals for tightening immigration rules – thought to include restrictions on employing cheaper foreign workers and provision to deport jobless Europeans after six months.
