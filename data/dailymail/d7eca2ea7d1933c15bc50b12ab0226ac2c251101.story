David Cameron was yesterday forced to admit that NHS nurses lack compassion after being confronted by former Strictly Come Dancing judge Arlene Phillips.

The 68-year-old told the Prime Minister how she had witnessed  nurses walking past dementia patients ‘as if they didn’t exist’ when visiting her mother-in-law in hospital over Christmas.

And she revealed how the 84-year-old, who does not suffer from dementia,  had been kept on the same ward in  Hereford Hospital as several Alzheimer’s patients, many of whom were ‘repeatedly calling out for nurses’.

Mrs Phillips, a supporter of the 
Alzheimer’s Society, who has spoken movingly in the past about her 
father’s  battle with dementia, claimed ‘every nurse in that ward walked
up and down as if they didn’t exist’.

Confronting Mr Cameron during a 
question and answer session at a conference in London yesterday, she 
asked: ‘How will you train nurses to care?’

The Tory leader was then forced to admit lack of compassion in the NHS was ‘the biggest problem we have’.

He added: ‘Some hospitals do a 
fantastic job and the level of care and attention from nurses is 
absolutely first class, but frankly in some of our hospitals it is not 
good enough.

‘You are right, you cannot teach 
people compassion – that has to be the vocation that leads you into 
nursing. But I think if you look at the best hospitals and compare them 
with the rest there are some things they are doing, often quite simple 
things, that can be copied.’

Mrs Phillips’s intervention came 
after the Prime Minister delivered a key note speech into how the 
Government intends to tackle the ‘national crisis’ in care.

He pledged to double the research 
budget for dementia to £66million a year by 2015 and also announced 
plans for all over-75s to be screened for dementia when they are 
admitted to hospital.

Mr Cameron said: ‘Dementia is a 
terrible disease. It is a scandal we haven’t kept pace with it.

'The 
level of diagnosis, understanding and awareness of dementia is 
shockingly low. It is as though we’ve been in collective denial.

‘We need an all-out fight-back 
against this disease; one that cuts across society. We did it with  
cancer in the 70s, with HIV in the 80s and 90s. We fought the stigma, 
stepped up to the challenge and made massive in-roads into fighting 
these killers.

‘Now we’ve got to do the same with 
dementia. This is a personal priority of mine, and it’s got an ambition 
to match. Nothing less than for Britain to be a world leader in dementia
research and care.’

Mrs Phillips has previously spoken of
her guilt at not being able to do enough for her late father Abraham 
who succumbed to Alzheimer’s disease.

In the 12 years leading up to his 
death in 2000, she revealed how she juggled caring for him, bringing up 
her two children and trying to keep her career going.

She has said: ‘I look back now and 
feel guilty that I didn’t do more. I think I could have tried to have a 
room for him in my house, or arranged nursing for him.’

Mrs Phillips’s comments came as figures from the Alzheimer’s Society revealed there are 800,000 dementia sufferers in the UK.

Its report found that two-thirds of 
sufferers admitted being lonely,  with half saying they had lost friends
since their diagnosis.

One admitted he had been admonished by a barman at his local pub for repeating himself.

A poll of 300 dementia patients 
carried out by the charity also found nearly half felt they were a 
burden to their family while another four in five felt depressed.

Previously the charity had estimated there were 750,000 dementia sufferers in Britain, with around 60 per cent undiagnosed.
