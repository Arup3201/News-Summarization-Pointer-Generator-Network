All 64 World Cup matches will be broadcast on flights around the world this summer for the first time in history.

The groundbreaking deal, which will see live sports channel Sport 24 show all the action from Brazil, means passengers no longer have to worry about missing their country's games while flying.

A total of nine airlines are signed up with the service, including Lufthansa, Emirates, Etihad and Turkish Airlines.
