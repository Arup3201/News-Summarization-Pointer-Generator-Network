A Connecticut man, 45, was arrested for posing online as member of boy band One Direction Harry Styles in order to entice young girls to perform sex acts for him via webcam.

John Eastman’s charges, reports the Waterbury Republican-American, include first-degree possession of child pornography, employing a minor in an obscene performance, and using a computer to entice a minor.

Eastman’s computer contained more than 500 images of child pornography, including some webcam images of children believed to be as young as 5, according to the arrest warrant.

Police said a search of Eastman’s computer also turned up video footage of several singers, including Styles and Justin Bieber.

According to an arrest warrant, Eastman used the screen name Harry.Styles888 on Skype and had pictures of the One Direction singer on his computer, which were used to convince children he was the 19-year-old Styles.

'My hope is that the girl will show me herself on camera and then pose in a sexual manner, or perform some kind of sex act for me to see,' Eastman told detectives, according to his arrest warrant.

Eastman would sometimes offer concert tickets in exchange for children posing naked or performing sex acts online, authorities said.

Police said they began investigating Eastman after being contacted by a Vermont state trooper, who had been looking into a complaint from a family about a conversation between three girls and a Skype-user posing as Styles.

Happened before: Another man, Simon Hale, also used a young idols to entice young girls to perform online for him and was sentenced to at least 10 years in 2012

Eastman was interviewed by police in late 2012 and willingly gave them his computer, according to his arrest warrant.

He then fled to Virginia, where he was arrested and returned to Connecticut, police said.

He was being held in jail in lieu of $500,000 bond and is due back in court next Thursday. It wasunclear if he had an attorney.

Eastman has a criminal history that includes a conviction for fourth-degree sexual assault. He spent 10 years on the state’s sex offender registry before being taken off of that list in 2009.

And this isn't the first time a grown man has posed as a One Directioner to fool young girls into performing for webcams.

in 2012, a man named Simon Hale was convicted of befriending underage girls and tricking them into performing sexual acts on their webcams by posing as Justin Bieber and One Direction's Niall Horan.

Hale persuaded the girls from Britain, Australia and Denmark into posing naked or topless for him as well as blackmailed the teenaged Bieber and 1D fans into performing sexual acts on Skype.

The 37-year-old was jailed for a minimum of ten years and the judge branded him so dangerous he may never be freed.

How common is it? Simon Hale used Justin Bieber's identity, as Eastman may have also done in addition to using Styles, in order to trick young girls into performing for him. But instead of Harry Styles, Hale posed as One Direction member Niall Horan

Hale tricked the underage girls into believing they would be able to talk to Justin Bieber and 1D’s Horan through a chat-room style website – although the recipient of their messages was in fact Hale, Plymouth Crown Court heard.

He then used sophisticated software to take over the young girls’ computers after which he recorded and used to blackmail some of them into committing on-camera sex acts.

When police tracked him down they found 35 Skype accounts and more than 180 homemade videos, mostly of young girls.
