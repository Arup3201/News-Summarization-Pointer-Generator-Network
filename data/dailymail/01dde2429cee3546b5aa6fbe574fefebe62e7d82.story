When it comes to moving your life abroad, expats should head to Switzerland if they want to improve on their quality of life.

But it's best not to move to the UK or US, both of which ranked near the bottom of the best places in the world for expats to live.

Switzerland, Singapore, China and Germany were voted the best places in the world for what they offer expats, while Egypt was rated the worst place to live abroad in the HSBC expat survey.

Switzerland was ranked as number one by expats looking for a well-balanced, high quality lifestyle, according to the seventh Expat Survey.

And Singapore, China, Germany and Bahrain followed in the rankings in the report commissioned by HSBC Expat.

But the UK and the US ranked in 33rd and 30th place out of 34 for quality of life for expats, with the UK just one spot above the bottom country, Egypt.

The Expat Explorer survey, conducted by YouGov, is one of the largest global surveys of expats. This year, nearly 9,300 expats from around the world shared their views on quality of life, financial wellbeing and the ease of raising a family abroad.

But while Switzerland topped the pile of 34 countries who fulfilled the sufficient criteria to complete the survey.

While life in the UK offers expats careers, property and, interestingly, the potential to ﬁnd a partner, it was not enough to prevent it languishing in penultimate place on the list.

Expats are most likely to head to the United Kingdom in pursuit of better job prospects (31 per cent) or to be with family and partners (31 per cent), but this year's survey reveals that expats there are also among the most likely to fall in love in their new country. 

Half of expats (50 per cent) there say that they have found a life partner since moving – second only to Italy (57 per cent) and higher than the global average of 36 per cent.

There is one country worse off than the UK however, Egypt, which is perhaps hardly surprising considering the civil fighting going on there over the last few years. 

In data obtained by MailOnline, New Zealand ranks on top as the country where the highest number of expats are likely to remain in the country with an incredible 90 per cent. 

The UK fares somewhat better, with 72 per cent of expats living here likely to remain on these shores.

Dean Blackburn, head of HSBC Expat, said: 'There are a great many decisions involved in making the move abroad, ranging from consideration of finances and managing money, right through to integrating into the local community and arranging childcare.

'While Asia continues to excel as a region for those looking for higher salaries, the Middle East draws career minded expats and New Zealand offers a great opportunity for those looking for quality of life and a good place to raise a family.

'This year's Expat Explorer league table shows that there are many countries that offer a good balance, providing expats with a rewarding and exciting experience.'

From a financial wellbeing perspective, Switzerland emerges as a destination to advance career prospects and receive a healthy salary while also maintaining a good work / life balance. One quarter (25 per cent) of expats in Switzerland earn more than USD200,000 p.a., yet over half (51 per cent) report a better work / life balance since moving.

Expats in Switzerland also have a lot of confidence in the local economy, with almost half (47 per cent) saying they are very satisfied with the state of the local economy – the highest proportion for any country included in this year’s survey.

Switzerland topped the pile of the best quality of life for expats - perhaps it's not hard to see why

Expats in Italy - the country was ranked in 31st position out of 34 for overall standard of living

Many expats in Switzerland comment on the country’s high quality of air and pleasant surroundings, with three quarters (75 per cent) agreeing that this is an improvement on their home country.

Expat parents also report that Switzerland offers benefits for families too, believing their offspring are now safer (81 per cent), enjoy a better quality of life (77 per cent) and receive a better education (65 per cent).

Asia: a hotspot for high earning expats 

Asia emerges from this year’s survey as the best region for financial wellbeing, with nearly one fifth (19 per cent) of expats earning over USD200,000 p.a. and 65 per cent saying they have more disposable income since relocating.

China is home to the largest proportion of high-earning expats in the world – nearly two-fifths (38 per cent) earn over USD200,000 p.a and over three quarters (76 per cent) have more disposable income than they did at home.

Elsewhere in Asia, around a quarter of expats in India (24 per cent) and Hong Kong (23 per cent) earn over the USD200,000 p.a. mark, with 56 per cent and 63 per cent respectively saying they have greater disposable income than before.

The Middle East attracts career-minded expats 

Nearly three-quarters (74 per cent) of expats in the Middle East report that they are satisfied with their host country’s current economic outlook - the highest of all regions in this year’s survey.

Countries in the Middle East continue to attract career-minded expats seeking to boost their earning potential, with nearly six in ten (56 per cent) expats who move to the Middle East doing so for better job prospects and over a third (35 per cent) moving to increase their income levels.

But it’s not all hard work – the survey reveals that the majority of expats in Bahrain enjoy a better work / life balance (62 per cent) and more enjoyable commute into work (68 per cent), in comparison to their home countries.

New Zealand: the winner for expat experience and family life 

Expats this year voted New Zealand as the best destination for expat life experience and raising a family abroad. The country ranks as the easiest place for expats to set up a new life, making it a popular option for expats young and old to enjoy a high quality lifestyle.

New Zealand is the destination where expats are most likely to move in order to improve their standard of living (54 per cent), as well as benefiting from the pleasant climate and picturesque scenery (89 per cent), friendly local people (75 per cent) and a good work / life balance (71 per cent).

Expat parents living in New Zealand also commented on the improved health and wellbeing (78 per cent) and safety of their children (87 per cent), as well as saying they are bringing up more confident and well-rounded individuals (58 per cent) since moving.
