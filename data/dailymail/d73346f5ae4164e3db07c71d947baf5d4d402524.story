Former Manchester United captain Bryan Robson claims Louis van Gaal's side have struggled at the start of the season because of Michael Carrick's absence.

The midfielder missed the first three months of the season due to ankle surgery as United laboured to just three wins in their opening nine games.

The 33-year-old was an unused substitute in draws against West Brom and Chelsea as he regains full fitness but Robson thinks the Manchester derby on Sunday could be a game too soon for Carrick.

'Michael's been a big miss to United,' Robson told the Daily Express. 'When he was injured last season he was a big loss to us and again this season.

'He's an intelligent player who gets into the right areas. He's about 6ft 2ins and defensively at set plays is very good. He intercepts things very well. That's why he's important as well.

'The only thing the manager has to be careful of is, if there are a few players coming back from injury, you don't want to play too many who are a little bit rusty because it's a derby game.

'It's going to be a million miles an hour, loads of passion and pace, so the lads who have been playing week in week out are probably more up to speed with the game.'

Robson has backed returning club captain Wayne Rooney to make a big impact at the Etihad Stadium in the Manchester derby on Sunday, also suggesting Robin van Persie's last-gasp equaliser against Chelsea was a perfect confidence boost for United.

'In the first half the lads performed well against a very good Chelsea side, full of pace and power,' he added. 'Chelsea are well established and rightly one of the favourites to win the title.

Captain Wayne Rooney could return for the Manchester derby after serving a three-game suspension

'United are in a transitional period with new players and new manager but after going a goal down they showed good character to come back and get a point.

'That should set them up nicely, going into the derby. Wayne Rooney's coming back, hopefully a few of the other injured players will be fit and ready. That sets it up really nicely for a good derby game.

'In these sort of games you need special players who can do special things and Wayne is one of those players.

'It's not just his ability but also his attitude. If the manager tells him to play in any position he is prepared to sacrifice himself for the team ... that's why he has achieved so much in his career already.'
