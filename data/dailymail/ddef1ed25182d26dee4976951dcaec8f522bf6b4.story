Nearly half a million people are to receive surprise bank refunds averaging £300 on charges and interest rate debts run up on credit cards, loans, HP and store cards.

Seventeen leading banks and building societies have agreed to pay up after making a blunder on the wording of credit agreements and penalty notices, the Office of Fair Trading revealed yesterday.

Some customers who were hit with penalty charges and interest rate fees over a long period could receive more than £1,000.

While the OFT has not named them, the 17 lenders involved are believed to include most, if not all, of the big high street names.

Their £149million bill comes on top of around £370million that Barclays and Northern Rock have agreed to pay, plus an undisclosed sum from the Co-op Bank.

In total, the finance industry faces a bill of more than £600million because executives failed to ensure documents complied with the Consumer Credit Act 1974.

Many people who were hit with the charges, which have now been ruled illegal and unfair, will have suffered real hardship as a result, perhaps struggling to put food on the table or pay the mortgage.

The fact that they were not keeping up with debt repayments means they are likely to have been suffering money troubles that will only have been made worse by the punishing late payment fees and interest charges.

The revelation represents a new blow for the banking industry, which already faces a bill of more than £20billion to refund charges linked to the sale of Payment Protection Insurance (PPI) alongside loans, cards and mortgages.

While the average refund will be some £300, some people who were hit with penalty charges and interest rate fees over a long period could be entitled to payments of more than £1,000.

Since October 2008, lenders have been obliged to send periodic statements to customers containing specific information and wording.

However, a bank or finance company that fails to provide the periodic statement using the correct wording is not entitled to enforce the agreement and the customer is not liable to pay interest or default sums.

The money is to be repaid after the OFT wrote to 50 banks and building societies in November 2013 asking them to confirm that they had fully discharged their obligations to provide post contract information under the Consumer Credit Act. 

'These issues were not deliberate misconduct, but the institutions concerned should have ensured they were complying with the law'

David Fisher, Office of Fair Trading director of consumer credit

David Fisher, the OFT’s director of consumer credit, said: ‘These issues were not deliberate misconduct, but the institutions concerned should have ensured they were complying with the law.

‘The OFT welcomes the proactive steps taken to return money to customers where it was incorrectly charged.’

The OFT said customers do not need to take any action because the banks and building societies involved have agreed to contact all the customers involved.

That raises the question as to whether consumers can trust the banks to do the right thing and take reasonable steps to trace all the people who are out of pocket and due a refund.

There is also a question as to whether the refund will only cover the specific charges and not any additional compensation to hardship and inconvenience.

The OFT said it is up to the bank to decide whether to add interest to the value of any refund of fees and charges.

It said customer who feel aggrieved and would like to pursue additional compensation should contact the bank concerned and then, if necessary, the Financial Ombudsman Service.

The OFT has not named the 17 banks and building societies involved, however the group is believed to include most if not all the major high street names.

'We want regulators to clamp down on excessive fees and charges so that borrowers are treated fairly whatever form of credit they’re using'

Richard Lloyd, Which? executive director

Which? executive director Richard Lloyd said: ‘It’s good to see the OFT taking this action but it should name and shame the 17 lenders involved so that customers are aware that they might be due compensation.

‘We’d also like some assurances about how lenders will contact people who were affected but are no longer their customers.

‘We want regulators to clamp down on excessive fees and charges so that borrowers are treated fairly whatever form of credit they’re using.’

Lloyds confirmed it will be making refunds, but refused to say how many customers are involved.

It said: ‘We are committed to ensuring that we provide our customers with the right information about credit agreements they have with us.

‘We have taken part in the OFT exercise and are now working to address cases where this has not happened. We will contact any affected customers in due course.’
