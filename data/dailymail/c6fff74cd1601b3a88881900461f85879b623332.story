Avoiding parking tickets is what makes British people feel lucky, according to a new study

People who enjoy good health, avoid the traffic warden and have sex more than 120 times a year consider themselves to be the luckiest in the country.Â 

According to new research not receiving parking tickets, never being seriously ill and having sex on average twice a week is what makes British people feel fortunate.

The study also reveals that six in 10 Britons say they are lucky with 83 per cent of them being in a relationship.

It also found that 43 per cent of people believe they have the rub of the green because they have never been seriously ill, while 31 per cent consider themselves fortunate because they have never been ticketed by a traffic warden.

However, two in five people who say they are unlucky have never done anything superstitious to turn around their luck with 61 per cent of them saying they would happily walk under a ladder.

Unlucky people are also twice as likely to be single and will probably not have any children.

Dr Rebecca Spelman, lead psychologist at the Private Therapy Clinic, said: 'Being classed as lucky is a question of perspective.

'It's
 people's thoughts and behaviours that influence their chances of 
success, which impact on how lucky they perceive themselves to be.

'They are more likely to give things a try and make good calculated risks.'

The study 
also found that men who think they are lucky have sex 134 times a year, 
with a partner who is, on average, six months younger than them. Almost 
80 per cent also believe their partner is more attractive than them.

Lucky men are also more likely to be a dog owner and 27 per cent say they are in a better job than they deserve.

For
 women who consider themselves lucky, they have sex an average of 110 
times a year, more than twice a week, with almost a quarter believing 
they are fortunate because they have a younger sexual partner.

Over half of them also have a white front door and 26 per cent own a cat.

The names of those who consider themselves the luckiest are John and Sarah, while Pauls and Sues say they are the least fortunate.

The UK's luckiest city is Edinburgh but the unluckiest is Bristol.

Mark Jones, of Mecca Bingo, who commissioned the research, said: 'It's great to see the nation's habits when it comes to luck and it's very positive that the majority think of themselves as lucky.

'For those that don't, it is evident there is room for improvement.'
