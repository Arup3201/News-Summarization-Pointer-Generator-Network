They came from different worlds â€“ she a former premier's daughter who grew up on Sydney's eastern suburbs and he a long-time drug user living in a halfway home in Sydney's west.

But Harriet Wran, 26, and boyfriend Michael Lee, 35, were united by their abuse of the highly-addictive drug ice.

The pair had reportedly been together for just two weeks when they, along with 29-year-old Lloyd Haines, allegedly entered Daniel McNulty's Redfern unit on Sunday and stabbed him to death in a botched $70 drug deal.

Police will allege Wran knocked on the door of unit B30 at the notorious Walker St housing commission block, as Lee and Haines waited wearing balaclavas and armed with two knives and a stonemason's hammer.

Investigators will claim Lee and Haines had stormed McNulty's apartment once before, and again burst into the unit on Sunday where Haines demanded 'Where is it?'.

Wran, a self-confessed ice addict, told police she was 'numb on ice' desperate for a hit when she went to suspected drug dealer Mr McNulty's unit and was 'frozen' with fear during a fight which saw Mr McNulty killed and a second man, Brett Fitzgerald, wounded on his neck.

In the time leading up to the alleged murder Wran was sleeping rough in Sydney's inner-city Surry Hills and Redfern, a source said.

Lee, who police say has a long history of drug abuse, lived in a halfway house in Fairfield in Sydney's western suburbs.

One neighbour, who did not wish to be named, said she had seen a woman come and go from the house in past month but could not confirm that it was Wran because she only saw her in the dark.

The neighbour, who has lived next door for just over a year, said new people were always moving in and out of the home.

She added that residents of the house had knocked on her door 'covered in blood' after a fight, asking for detergent to wash their clothes and police had also knocked on her door to question them about disturbances.

Other neighbours said men were 'coming and going all the time' and they usually left early in the morning and returned late at night.

Meanwhile Wran, heiress to her late father and former NSW premier Neville Wran's multi-million dollar estate, was living off a Centrelink payment of $560 a fortnight and had been on the dole since as early as 2012.

Following Wran and Lee's arrest at Liverpool train station on Wednesday the fact they came from separate worlds was again made clear.

During a brief court hearing on Thursday, Wran was represented by a team of lawyers including high-profile defence barrister Winston Terracini SC, who has successfully argued the innocence of many defendants in high-profile murder cases.

Mr Terracini appeared in Liverpool Local Court on her behalf on Thursday where he did not apply for bail and said Wran would plead not guilty to the charges of murder, attempted murder and break and enter.

Meanwhile Lee was represented by Legal Aid lawyer Gary Anderson, who also appeared in court on his behalf and did not apply for bail. Both are due to reappear in court on October 8.

Wran started high school at all-girls private school Ascham in Edgecliff in Sydney's eastern suburbs.

In Year 9 she moved to a different private school, Sydney Church of England Girls Grammar School (SCEGGS), in inner-city Darlinghurst and graduated there in 2006.

In 2007 she began a Bachelor of Arts at the University of Sydney.

A friend, who wished to remain anonymous, told Daily Mail Australia she used drugs including cocaine and ecstasy while at university but she became more focussed when she started working as a producer at Foxtel's Weather Channel.

'It really surprised me she had fallen off the rails because she seemed to have herself sorted out when she got a producer job at The Weather Channel,' he said.

'She partied pretty hard at uni but it was just pills and coke.

'But when she got her job she was really career focussed and worked very long hours.'

By 2012 Wran was sharing a rented flat in Hunters Hill with another man. Her landlord said large groups of men would visit the house often during both the day and night, the Sydney Morning Herald reported.

Police came to the property to arrest the man she was living with three months after she moved in.

The landlord said when he inspected the property it was dirty and looked like a 'crack den' with pipes and cigarettes strewn around.

Following her alleged murder charge other friends have described her as a 'good person'.

'Harriet was and still is, to the best of my knowledge, a kind, intelligent, thoughtful, insightful and caring woman,' another friend told Daily Mail Australia.

'I know nothing of her recent involvements and reserve my assumptions till proper proceedings have taken place.'

It is understood Ms Wran had a drug problem for years and was in recovery, but suffered a relapse shortly after her father's death.

At the time she was living in the family home in Woollahra but she ran away.

Her father Neville Wran was one of Australia's most celebrated politicians. The Labor Party icon was the New South Wales Premier from 1976 to 1986 - he died on April 20 this year, aged 87.

Harriet Wran was by her father's side when he died in April. She and younger brother, Hugo, accompanied their mother Jill to the public memorial at Sydney Town Hall.

But his death would spark a bitter family battle over the estate; which included a $10 million mansion in Woollahra, as well as multi-million-dollar properties in Woolloomooloo, Palm Beach and the Yarramalong Valley.
