Danny Welbeck hopes to draw inspiration from his idol Thierry Henry's success at Arsenal after completing a deadline day switch to the Emirates. 

Welbeck will embark on a new career in north London after he signed a five-year deal with the Gunners following a £16million switch from boyhood club Manchester United.

Arsene Wenger moved for the England international after Olivier Giroud was ruled out until the new year with a broken foot.

On the ball: The forward came on as a second-half substitute in England's slender win over Norway 

Star man: Welbeck has revealed he looked up to Arsenal's all-time leading goalscorer Thierry Henry 

And while Welbeck, who came off the bench as a second-half substitute in England’s 1-0 win over Norway on Wednesday night, concedes that competition for places at Arsenal will be intense, he is looking to Henry, the club’s all-time leading goalscorer, as a source for inspiration.

‘I loved watching Thierry Henry since I was a little kid,’ said Welbeck. ‘My two idols are Ryan Giggs and Thierry Henry so to come to the club where he was and had so much success at is something you can look up to and try to stamp your own print on the club.

‘There's definitely competition and I think once you come to a big club, there is always going to be competition.

‘Unfortunately there are a couple of injuries at the moment but I think once everyone is fighting fit, everybody will want to be on the pitch scoring goals and that's healthy competition for the squad.’

Welbeck is expected to make his debut when the Premier League action resumes after the international break.

Arsenal host Manchester City, and Welbeck has promised the club’s fans he’ll give everything in his bid to win over the Emirates faithful.

Speaking to Arsenal’s official website, Welbeck added: ‘I just want them to know that I will give 100 per cent in every single game.

Down and out: Olivier Giroud has been ruled out of action until the new year with a broken foot 

‘I play with my heart on my sleeve and I'm always going to give my best. I'll try to give them so many happy days in the coming future.

‘I know a lot about Arsenal. I don't think there are many people in England who won't know about Arsenal and what a big club this is. The stadium is fantastic and the team has got a legendary manager and magnificent players who have also been brought in.

‘It seems like a family club and that's something that's really enticing. I'm so glad to be here.’
