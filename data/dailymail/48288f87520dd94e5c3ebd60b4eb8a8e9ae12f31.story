CLICK HERE for all the stats from the Cherries' Capital One Cup win over the Baggies on Tuesday night 

It's what you might term an upset, though you suspect Alan Irvine can’t have been too devastated. Not when he made 10 changes to the side he fielded in his most recent Barclays Premier League fixture.

A cheer for the plucky underdog, then? Not quite. Bournemouth made the same number of changes.

What a strange state of affairs, when a last-16 cup tie can’t draw full enthusiasm from either club. More so when each manager would have been entitled to believe they had a good shot at a quarter-final place.

That fate ultimately belongs to Bournemouth, who have reached the last eight of the Capital One Cup for the first time in their history.

Subs not used: Foster, Wisdom, Gardner, Roofe.

Booked: Dawson, Mulumbu.

Man of the match: Eunan O’Kane.

Referee: Paul Tierney 6.5. 

The manner of the finale was suitably dramatic.

Eunan O’Kane had seemingly done enough to put Bournemouth through with a strike early in the second half, only for Georgios Samaras to level with a shot that deflected heavily off Tommy Elphick.

That appeared to be that for a side that has achieved so much in recent years, but then it got a little sweeter when, within seconds of the restart, substitute Callum Wilson scored the winner.

What drama. It might even make this competition attractive to Bournemouth.

Of course, it will need to be balanced against those priorities in the Championship, in which they are currently sitting an impressive fourth after a scarcely believable 8-0 win away at Birmingham at the weekend.

Eddie Howe only retained Tommy Elphick from that team; Irvine kept Craig Dawson from the 11 who started in the draw against Crystal Palace.

As it transpired, the opportunity of game time brought decent performances from players of both sides.

Within two minutes, Yann Kermorgant lashed a shot from distance that Boaz Myhill saved and moments later Craig Dawson was forced to haul down Tokelo Rantie to prevent a breakaway. 

The fact Youssouf Mulumbu committed a similar offence later in the half said plenty about Rantie’s pace on the counter, which was evidently Bournemouth’s main ploy.

At the other end, West Brom threatened without looking dangerous.

Scoring hasn’ t been a problem for them in the Premier League – a tally of 12 that stands up to scrutiny against their rivals in the bottom half - but for a time here they looked ponderous.

Nothing too blatant at set-pieces. C

raig Dawson and Gareth McAuley were both happy to get close at corners for West Brom, but nothing especially untoward.

When Christian Gamboa crossed from the right, Liam O’Neil slipped his marker but barely connected with his header. Victor Anichebe also played in Brown Ideye, but the £10million striker shot straight at Lee Camp. 

They started the second half with a shade more incision, Sebastian Blanco sidestepping a challenge and dipping a shot narrowly over the bar from the edge of the area.

But by the 49th minute they were behind. Considering they came into the fixture with a single away win this season and only one draw, perhaps it should not have been a surprise.

Junior Stanislas made the goal, surging at a backline that kept on retreating. He reached the edge of the area unchallenged and slipped a pass left to O’Kane, who shot across Myhill and inside the far post.

Ryan Fraser then came close to making it 2-0. The winger’s pace caused West Brom problems most of the night but his finishing let him down when Adam Smith found space on the right and drilled a low cross towards the penalty spot. Fraser controlled with his back to goal, but in shooting on the turn miscued horribly.

Samaras levelled after 85 minutes with a heavily deflected shot from the left, but substitute Wilson hit the winner seconds later.

Howe threw his hands in the air. He has overseen a special time at Bournemouth. He took the club into the Championship in his first season at the club and consolidated their status by finishing 10th in the last campaign.

At the weekend, they obliterated Birmingham and sit in the play-off places. Now they are in a hat with only seven other numbers. Not bad for a second string from the second tier.
