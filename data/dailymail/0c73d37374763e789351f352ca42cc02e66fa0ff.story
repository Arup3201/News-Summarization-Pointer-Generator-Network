Workers at a Denver restaurant had no idea that a vagrant had been living in the rafters until on Tuesday night he fell through the ceiling, triggering a flood.

Denver police received an unusual call from the Yard House eatery on Court Street at around 11pm reporting an intruder who had plummeted from the rafters.

When officers arrived on the scene, they spotted the unwelcome guest, later identified as 36-year-old Steven Graves, walking around the scaffolding.

Unwelcome patron: Denver police received an unusual call from the Yard House eatery in Denver reporting an intruder who had plummeted from the rafters

Hideaway: Police found multiple bottle caps from liquor bottles in the ceiling, suggesting that the man had been living there for some time  

Waterworks: Intruder Steven Graves apparently caused a water pipe in the ceiling to rupture, flooding the restaurant and the adjoining lobby of the Sheraton Hotel 

Strange sounds: Officers working on the scene heard moaning coming from near the restaurant's entrance

Trapped: Police pulled back a booth chair and saw Graves’ feet sticking out of the wall

Half naked: Graves, pictured on a stretcher after his extraction from the wall, was only wearing a pair of jeans

Graves then disappeared from view, and while officers could not see him he somehow ruptured a water main, flooding the Yard House and the lobby of the Sheraton hotel next door, according to The Denver Channel.

Police climbed up to the ceiling, where they discovered evidence that the intruder had been living there for quite some time.

James Ballinger, with the Denver Police Department, said that the space was strewn with bottle caps from liquor bottles.

About three hours later, officers working on the scene heard moaning coming from near the restaurant's entrance.

They pulled back some booth chairs and saw Graves’ feet sticking out of the wall. Firefighters had to use a chainsaw to cut him out.

The ceiling dweller was only wearing a pair of jeans and was taken to a hospital to be treated for injuries after taking a 20-foot fall.

The lobby of the Sheraton hotel next door was flooded as a result of the water main rupture 

The Yard House was able to reopen for lunch the day after the dramatic incident 

Graves was later booked into jail on burglary and criminal mischief charges.

The burst pipe caused a lot of damage to both the hotel lobby and the eatery, but the Yard House reopened for lunch the following day.
