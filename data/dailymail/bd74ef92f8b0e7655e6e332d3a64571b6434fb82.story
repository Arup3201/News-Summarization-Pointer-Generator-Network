A man has used a barbell to fracture his seven-year-old son's skull before turning it on his wife and mother-in-law in a frenzied attack in Queens, police say.

The attack on Wednesday evening occurred just a month after the man had moved to the U.S. with his family from China.

And once the brutal attack had subsided, 49-year-old Quan Hui Liang then unsuccessfully attempted to commit suicide.

Following the attack, Liang's seven-year-old son was taken to hospital with multiple fractures to his skull, where he has since undergone emergency surgery.

His mother, 44, and grandmother, 77, were both left with broken eye sockets and cuts.

A resident from the Flushing, Queens area where the incident occurred told NBC New York she saw the three family members being stretchered out of the home. 

'I heard the ambulance at like nine, and I was really surprised because nothing ever happens on this street.'

She added that the young boy 'was so shocked he wasn't even crying or anything, so it was really sad'.

'He was hugging his grandma and they were on a stretcher.'

The New York Post reported that police found a barbell and kitchen knife in the home.

Among other charges, Liang is facing two counts of attempted murder, possession of a weapon and assault, the paper reported.
