A woman who underwent a drastic double mastectomy to reduce her risk of breast cancer was horrified to be told by surgeons she already had the disease. 

Emma Cunliffe was terrified of contracting the disease and so elected for the surgery ahead of her 31st birthday - the age at which both her mother and grandmother were diagnosed.

But she was devastated when doctors revealed they had found cancer in her left breast.

Emma Cunliffe, 30, was terrified of contracting breast cancer, after both her mother (pictured)  and grandmother were diagnosed in their early 30s. After having a preventative mastectomy, she was horrified to be told she already had the disease

Mrs Cunliffe, 30, said: 'I went back after the surgery and was told I had a 6cm-long tumour.

'It was a cotton-wool consistency so hadn't been dense enough to show up on previous MRI scans.

'It hit me like a bus, I was in complete shock that this could have happened.'

Doctors added that had the grade two cancer been found any later, it would have been too late to treat it. 

'If I'd not had the operation, I wouldn't have known about the tumour until it was too late,' said Mrs Cunliffe, from Warrington, Cheshire.

'I felt so lucky and like I had been saved. What if I had left it any longer?

'It scared me that I didn't know it was there.'

She added: 'There's no doubt in my mind that the mastectomy saved my life. It's been a whirlwind three months.'

The shocking news meant she and her fiance Chris, 26, brought their  wedding forward by 18 months and tied the knot in last November.

'We brought the wedding forwards because I'm proof that you never know what's round the corner,' she said.

The civil servant said she felt like a 'ticking time bomb' after being checked for signs of breast cancer from the age of 16.

This was due to her mother and grandmother both falling victim to the disease in their early 30s.

The devastating news that she had a 6cm-long tumour in her left breast prompted Mrs Cunliffe and her now husband Chris to move their forward by 18 months to November last year (pictured)

And Mrs Cunliffe became even more worried about her breast cancer risk when she tested positive for the breast cancer gene.

She said: 'I was always thinking about it. It's always been my biggest fear and the closer I got to my 30s, the more worried I got.

'In my head I was thinking if "I don't have this operation by the time I'm 31, I'm going to get cancer".

'I had always been assumed as high-risk and they assumed I would have the gene. For the medical people to tell you you're high risk is even more worrying.'

For this reason, she had already made the decision to have the mastectomy.

'I didn't want the worry of breast cancer to take over my life,' she said.

'I wanted to have the operation and move on with my life.'

'Now I know that if I hadn't had it things could be so much worse.' 

Mrs Cunliffe underwent a double mastectomy in October 2014 at Royal Liverpool Hospital.

Mrs Cunliffe (pictured left four weeks before her preventative mastectomy) had been worried about her risk of cancer all her life, due to the fact she carried the BRCA gene which increases the risk of disease

Mrs Cunliffe underwent a double mastectomy in October last year at Royal Liverpool Hospital. The procedure involved having her nipples and breast tissue removed and implants inserted beneath her skin

The procedure involved having her nipples and breast tissue removed and implants inserted beneath her skin.

Two weeks later, she returned to hospital to have her breasts drained of fluids - only to receive the awful news she had cancer.

As a result, she began a 10-day course of radiotherapy in January.

She has also started taking hormones to prevent the cancer returning, which she will have to take daily for the rest of her life.

While she is still receiving radiotherapy, medics predict she will make a full recovery - and  the couple are hoping to finally start a family of their own.

Mrs Cunliffe added: 'I felt like a ticking time bomb waiting for cancer to strike, so as soon as I got the go-ahead to have a preventative op, I went for it.

Like Angelina Jolie, who also had a preventative mastectomy and now her ovaries removed, Mrs Cunliffe(with husband Chris) plans to do the same

'Thank heavens I did - or I wouldn't be here today. Instead, the future is looking positive. I've just got married to the man of my dreams, and I'm on my way to being healthy.'

And like Angelina Jolie, who also had a preventative mastectomy and now her ovaries removed, Mrs Cunliffe plans to do the same. 

She said: 'It's a big decision and it's very brave of Angelina. It's a big thing to do as a woman.

'It's taking away all of her female parts. Your breasts and your ovaries are part of being a woman and they make up your identity.

'But it is removing the risks at the same time and that's the most important thing.

'It's the same as when Angelina had her double mastectomy - by having it done while not suffering from cancer, it's just another operation that she will recover from a lot quicker without all the chemotherapy and side effects that come with it.'

She added: 'With the cancer gene, we're 40 per cent more likely to develop ovarian cancer. I will be having my ovaries removed but before I do that I want the chance to have children first.

'It's encouraging to hear of celebrities and big names going through the same things as it makes people who are unaware, aware of it.

'It also gives this type of procedure a more high profile and helps people to understand what we're going through and the reasons for it.'

Martin Ledwick, head information nurse at Cancer Research UK, said: 'For women with the BRCA gene fault, having their ovaries removed can significantly reduce their risk of developing ovarian cancer.

'It also has an added effect of helping to reduce the chances of getting breast cancer, too.

'However, it is important to remember that only a relatively small proportion of breast and ovarian cancers are caused by one of these gene faults, so only a small number of women will be faced with this difficult choice.

'If you're concerned about a family history of breast and ovarian cancer, you can phone our cancer information nurses on 0808 800 4040.'
