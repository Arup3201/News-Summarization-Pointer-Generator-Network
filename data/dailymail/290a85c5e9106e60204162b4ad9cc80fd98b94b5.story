Police are struggling to identify two children found wandering the streets of Long Beach alone without any adult supervision.

California's Long Beach Police Department has now asked for the public's help in identifying the children - thought to be aged one and two - as well as tracking down their parents.

Police said the African American boys appeared to be in good health but were unsure exactly how long they had been without supervision.

Police were called at 8.45am yesterday to check on the children after a concerned passerby spotted them without any noticeable supervision on Atlantic Avenue and 60th Street. 

The older child was found wearing a brightly colored Incredible Hulk themed t-shirt, shorts and sandals, while the younger boy was wearing a stripey t-shirt and diaper.

Police said: 'Witnesses in the immediate area were interviewed but no one was seen with the children or dropping them off.

'The area was searched for any possible video but none was found. A two-block area was also canvassed, however, no one recognizing the children was located.'

However, security camera footage from a nearby liquor did show the two toddlers wandering down the sidewalk, KTLA5 reported.

The footage was taken from a nearby liquor store but the owners were unable to identify the parents

The liquor store owner told the network she knew the family, who were regular customers, but was unable to provide names.

Police added that law enforcement agencies in Los Angeles County, as well as five surrounding counties, had been notified, and the children had been handed over to the Department of Children and Family Services.

Anyone who recognizes the children, has information regarding their identity or the identity of their parents is urged to call Long Beach Police Communications at (562) 435-6711, or 911 if calling from the city of Long Beach.
