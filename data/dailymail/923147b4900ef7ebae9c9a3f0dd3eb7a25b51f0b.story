Steven Higginson, 33, was stabbed outside a primary school in Salford as he waited to collect three of his children

A 30-year-old woman has been arrested on suspicion of attempted murder after a father-of-six was repeatedly stabbed outside a primary school while waiting to collect his children.

The man, named locally as 33-year-old Steven Higginson, was knifed in the chest after a scuffle broke out outside North Walkden Primary School in Salford, Greater Manchester, at 3.30pm yesterday. 

The incident took place in front of shocked family and friends as Mr Higginson was waiting outside the school gates to collect three of his young children.  

Despite being covered in blood, Mr Higginson managed to stagger into the school to get help and was rushed to Manchester Royal Infirmary. He has since been discharged.

Earlier, Greater Manchester Police appealed for a man and woman, who they believed were involved in the attack, to come forward.

They believe the couple, who made off from the scene in a silver Vauxhall Corsa, are known to the victim and that yesterday's attack was part of an 'ongoing dispute'.  

This afternoon, Detective Inspector Ben Hart urged the man to hand himself in to police.

He said: 'We have an arrest but we are still looking for a man in connection with the incident.

'I would appeal directly to this person to hand himself in. You know who you are and you know we are onto you.

'We will not stop looking until you are in custody so I would advise you make it easier on yourself and hand yourself in to the nearest police station.' 

Yesterday, brother-in-law David Quinn, 27, told the Manchester Evening News how the incident broke out when he had gone with Mr Cunningham to pick up the children.

Mr Quinn said the stabbing took place over 'something which had been going on a couple of months'. 

He said: 'I'd gone inside the school and he was waiting in the car round the corner.

'When I came back he was stood there by the car holding his chest and saying "I've been stabbed, I've been stabbed". We went into the school straight away and phoned an ambulance. 

'He looked pale and in a bad way and they took him to MRI. We know who did it. It was over something which had been going on a couple of months, there'd been a lot of talk back and forth. 

Forensic officers were last night investigating after the father-of-six was repeatedly stabbed during the fight

A 30-year-old woman has been arrested on suspicion of attempted murder after the incident yesterday 

'There was a lot of people around and I'd ask anyone who say anything or has any information to speak to the police if they haven't already.'  

One parent who witnessed the incident added that had had seen two men 'wrestling' over a car.

He described how he rushed over to help the victim and dragged the male attacker away. 

Another witness said the attacked had Mr Higginson on the car bonnet and stabbed him 'near his heart'.    

Reports say the injuries were caused using a small lock knife with holes in the blade.

Bernard Pennington, the school's chair of governors, said: 'It makes me very sad and also very sad to think that somebody could do something like this is front of a group of children.

'I hope the school won't be associated with what happened because the school is a good school and the parents are good parents.

'This is a one-off which we hope will never be repeated.'

Detective Inspector Ben Hart, of Greater Manchester Police (GMP) said: 'Obviously at that time of the day, there would have been a number of parents picking up their children.

'A lot of people would have witnessed what happened which would have been very distressing.

'We now understand the victim, the man and woman are all known to each other. We believe there has been an ongoing dispute which has erupted into violence outside the primary school.

'The nature of this attack is appalling and I would like to reassure the children, parents and local residents that this appears to be an incident between people who were known to each other already and not a random attack.

'There is no suggestion from the inquiries undertaken so far that any children were directly at risk during the attack.

'We are now working closely with the school to make sure that all necessary measures are taken to support a return to normality for the children on Monday.

'I would like to appeal for anyone with information to come forward and make contact with us if they have seen any part of these events taking place.

'We are now making extensive inquiries to trace the two parties who attacked the victim and I would like to appeal directly to them to make contact with me as soon as possible.' 

North Walkden Primary School has 200 pupils,  with nursery and reception children and classes up to Year 6.

It was rated 'good' by Ofsted in a report in October 2013, improving from a 'satisfactory' rating from previous inspection. 

Anyone with information is asked to call police in 0161 856 5097 or Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111.
