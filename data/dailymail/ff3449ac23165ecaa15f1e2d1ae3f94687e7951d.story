Shocking figures revealed today that one in 15 people in America is now living in poverty.

The number - a record high - is spread widely across metropolitan areas as the country's economic troubles continue to bite.

And almost 15 per cent of the population are also now on food
 stamps, it emerged yesterday.

The ranks of the poor applying for 
food stamps increased by a worrying 8.1 per cent over the past year to 
make a total of 45.8 million.

Hand out nation: America's economic troubles are continuing to bite with almost 15% of the US population now on food stamps

The increase in poverty is believed to have been caused 
due to the housing bust pushing many inner-city poor into suburbs and 
other outlying places and shriveled jobs and income.

'There now really is no unaffected 
group, except maybe the very top income earners,' said Robert Moffitt, a
 professor of economics at Johns Hopkins University.

'Recessions are 
supposed to be temporary, and when it's over, everything returns to 
where it was before. But the worry now is that the downturn — which will
 end eventually — will have long-lasting effects on families who lose 
jobs, become worse off and can't recover.'

Split societies: The top ten cities where there is the greatest divide between rich and poor

Once-booming Sun Belt metro areas are now seeing some of the biggest jumps in concentrated poverty.

1 Mississippi 21.5%2 New Mexico 20.7%3 Oregon 20.6%4 Tennessee 20.2%5 Louisiana 19.9%

About 20.5 million Americans, or 6.7 
per cent of the U.S. population, make up the poorest poor, defined as 
those at 50 per cent or less of the official poverty level.

Those living in deep poverty represent
 nearly half of the 46.2 million people scraping by below the poverty 
line. In 2010, the poorest poor meant an income of $5,570 or less for an
 individual and $11,157 for a family of four.

That 6.7 percent 
share is the highest in the 35 years that the Census Bureau has 
maintained such records, surpassing previous highs in 2009 and 1993 of 
just over 6 percent.

After declining during the 1990s 
economic boom, the proportion of poor people in large metropolitan areas
 who lived in high-poverty neighborhoods jumped from 11.2 per cent in 
2000 to 15.1 per cent last year, according to a Brookings Institution 
analysis released on Thursday.

As a whole, the number of poor in the 
suburbs who lived in high-poverty neighborhoods rose by 41 per cent 
since 2000, more than double the growth of such city neighborhoods.

Poverty for Americans 65 and older is 
on track to nearly double after factoring in rising out-of-pocket 
medical expenses, from nine per cent to more than 15 per cent.

Poverty increases are also anticipated
 for the working-age population because of commuting and child-care 
costs, while child poverty will dip partly due to the positive effect of
 food stamps.

The number of people seeking unemployment benefits fell to the lowest in five weeks, government data showed on Thursday, in a hopeful sign for the struggling job market.

Initial jobless claims totalled 397,000 in the week ending October 29, down from a revised 406,000 claims the previous week, the Labor Department reported.

The claims number was lower than the average analyst estimate of 401,000, and provided a positive reading on the depressed job market ahead of Friday's October jobs data.

It was the third time in six months that weekly initial jobless claims have fallen below 400,000.

Last week's reading was the lowest since September 24, when claims stood at 395,000.

But applications need to fall consistently below 375,000 to signal sustainable job growth.

They haven't been below that level since February. Applications have been above 400,000 for all but two weeks since March.

The figures come a day before the government releases its October jobs report.

Analysts expect employers added 100,000 net jobs, nearly the same as the 103,000 added in September. The unemployment rate is expected to stay at 9.1 per cent for a fourth straight month.

Employers have added an average of only 72,000 jobs per month in the past five months. That's far below the 100,000 per month needed to keep up with population growth. And it's down from an average of 180,000 in the first four months of this year.

And with one in 15 in poverty, more than one in four of working age are now tapping food stamps.

According to Department of 
Agriculture figures, worst hit were people in Mississippi, where more 
than 21 per cent were recipients.

One
 in five residents in Tennessee, Oregon, New Mexico and Louisiana also 
depended on the hand outs - formally known as the Supplemental Nutrition
 Assistance Program (SNAP) - to eat.

Officials fear the numbers may swell even more in the coming months as people battle financial hardship and record unemployment.

But
 one reason for the rising number of recipients was that many states 
have waived requirements limiting the assets food stamp applicants could
 own, said the Wall Street Journal.

The number of food stamp users
 exploded after the recession hit in late 2007 and has continued growing
 even though the downtown is officially supposed to be over.

Researchers
 from the Carsey Institute at the University of New Hampshire estimated 
that the percentage of Americans receiving food stamps increased by 61.2
 per cent  between 2007 and 2010.

Reliance on the Supplemental Nutritional Assistance Programme was very high among single parents, rising ten per cent.

In
 2010, 42 per cent of single mothers and 25 per cent of single fathers 
relied on the stamps. In rural areas it was ever higher at one in two 
single mothers.

States also
 made changes to make it easier for residents to tap into the program, 
such as waiving requirements that limited the value of assets food stamp
 recipients could own.

This is believed to have been caused 
due to the housing bust pushing many inner-city poor into suburbs and 
other outlying places and shriveled jobs and income.

'There now really is no unaffected 
group, except maybe the very top income earners,' said Robert Moffitt, a
 professor of economics at Johns Hopkins University. 'Recessions are 
supposed to be temporary, and when it's over, everything returns to 
where it was before. But the worry now is that the downturn — which will
 end eventually — will have long-lasting effects on families who lose 
jobs, become worse off and can't recover.'

The institute also found that 14.6 per cent of rural households were relying on the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Programme in 2010.

Suburban households are less likely to receive SNAP benefits, but usage is on the rise. About nine per cent of suburban households received SNAP in 2010, up from 5.4 pe rcent in 2007.

Jessica Bean, a vulnerable families research associate with the Carsey Institute, said she thinks rural residents have traditionally been less likely to collect SNAP benefits because they live in remote areas where it’s hard to access social services and are more concerned with the social stigma.

In a rural area, she said: 'When you go into the grocery store and you pull out your food stamps card, everybody knows you.'

Just one in ten married couples with children are using the government-funded food benefit.
