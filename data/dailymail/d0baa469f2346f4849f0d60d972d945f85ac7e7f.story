Comedian Peter Kay has jokingly quipped that actor Ted Robbins is ‘off his head on morphine’ after telling of his relief after his colleague’s recovery.

The Phoenix Night star suffered a cardiac arrest on the opening night of the show at the Manchester Arena on Saturday January 31.

Two medics rushed from the 10,000 sell-out crowd to tend to him before he was taken to hospital.

He suffered twelve broken ribs and a cracked sternum as medics desperately battled to save his life.

Mr Robbins, 59, will not now need open-heart surgery as originally feared and may leave hospital after a ‘routine’ procedure next week.

In an interview, Mr Kay said how he and cast members of Phoenix Night Live were delighted by their close friend's speedy recovery. 

But he joked: 'We just re-calibrated as they say, moved things around, changed that bit and carried on.

'I’ve spoken to him and he’s making jokes same as ever - he’s off his head on morphine.'

Ted’s sister Kate revealed her brother suffered rheumatic fever as a child, which affected a heart valve.

He was due to have a ‘routine’ heart operation to fix the problem before his on-stage heart scare.

He remains in a stable condition at Wythenshawe Hospital.

Mr Robbins' sister Kate described the moment her brother collapsed: 'We were all hysterically laughing and jumping up and down when he came on in the second half - his daughter Molly, his wife and his son Jack.

'Then he just dropped like a stone and we just said "that's not in the act". We ran and had to barge past, but security wouldn't let us on stage.

'Thank God there was a heart surgeon in the audience and a paramedic who just got there and saved his life. It was a surreal nightmare. But luckily he's doing great. 

'What's been overwhelming has been the thousands and thousands of good wishes from everyone. 

'There has been so many comedians saying such great things about him.

'Ted is known as "the comedian's comedian". He's known for his wit - but more so probably for his caring of other human beings.'
