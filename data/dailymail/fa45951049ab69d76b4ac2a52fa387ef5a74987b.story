A house that was destroyed by fire is set to sell at auction for over $650,000, with the real estate agent describing the home as the 'cheapest' property on the market in Sydney's Inner West.

Owner Tom Noicos, 54, is being forced to sell his St Peters home after his housemate allegedly lit it on fire and his insurance company rejected his claim because the fire was allegedly lit deliberately.

The Block's auctioneer Damien Cooley has signed on to draw more interest to the property, after he heard the 'sad story' and wanted to help.

This fire-damaged house in St Peters in Sydney's Inner West is set to sell for over $650,000 at auction

The house was partially destroyed when owner Tom Noicos's housemate allegedly set fire to his bedroom

The three-bedroom freestanding brick home is being advertised as presenting a 'once-in-a-lifetime opportunity for renovators, builders and savvy investors alike to capitalise on this highly sought after piece of Inner West real estate'.

Mr Noicos, 54, is being forced to sell the home because his insurance claim was rejected

'The entry reveals dramatic fire damage to the hallway and first bedroom with only mostly smoke soot through the remaining rooms of the house,' the ad reads.

Mr Noicos, a former IT worker,  has owned the house for about 12 years and lived there with his former housemate, 55, until a year ago.

In August he let his former friend, who cannot be named, come stay with him for a week because 'he had nowhere else to go'. 

'I lost everything,' Mr Noicos told Daily Mail Australia. 

'I try to do the right thing and I get this.'

Mr Noicos said he had not had any disagreements with his former friend of almost 20 years on the day of the incident.

'Everything was fine, in fact he drove me to the doctor in the morning and said ring me when you finish up and I'll come pick you up,' he said.

'I kept ringing and there was no answer, so I got a taxi home and had to face police, ambulances and fire brigades putting out my house.'

Afterwards his insurance company NRMA Insurance put him up in an apartment in the city but two weeks ago they rejected his claim.

'Their reason being that I gave him permission to be in the house', Mr Noicos said, and the man allegedly lit it deliberately.

'But I'm like, I didn't give him permission to light the fire!

'It's been a very bad experience for me… I'm trying to appeal the decision because I don't think it's fair.'

The Block's auctioneer Damien Cooley has signed on to draw more interest to the property, after he heard the 'sad story' and wanted to help

Real estate agent Santos Sulfaro said since Richardson & Wrench Leichhardt posted the property ad at midday on Monday his phone had been ringing off the hook

Police said a 55-year-old man is due to appear in Central Local Court on December 1, charged with contravening an apprehended violence order and damaging a property by fire.

Mr Noicos can't afford to stay in the apartment, or pay to fix the damage to his St Peters home, so he has decided to sell.

Real estate agency Richardson & Wrench Leichhardt are enlisting Damien Cooley from The Block to conduct the auction on November 22 in order to draw more interest.

Mr Cooley said it was a sad story and he wanted to help Mr Noicos get a good result.

'You don't like these things come to people, and it's by no fault of his own, so I thought it was a good thing to be involved in,' he told Daily Mail Australia.

Mr Cooley said he had been involved in the sale of derelict and damaged homes in the past but this was that worst one he'd seen 'for quite some time'.

Mr Sulfaro said the fire damage was contained to the front four metres of the home, but the rest of the house was covered in soot

'In some respects it looks a lot worse than it really is,' he said.

'The smoke damage gives it the feeling that the whole house is in wrack and ruin.'

Real estate agent Santos Sulfaro said since Richardson & Wrench posted the property ad at midday on Monday his phone had been ringing off the hook.

'It's had quite a lot of interest from people curious about the price range and what the possibilities are,' Mr Sulfaro told Daily Mail Australia.

'We're looking at above $650,000, but prior to the fire it easily would have achieved $950,000.'

Mr Sulfaro said the fire damage was contained to the front four metres of the home.

'If it was someone from a building background they could fix it up easily for $80-$100,000,' he said. 

'For someone else with no building background it could cost up to $150,000, but still even at that price there's a lot of hard work involved that's not going to cost you a lot of money. 

Mr Sulfaro said the air-conditioning ducts and electrical wiring would also need to be replaced

The house also has its original timber floors and high metal press ornate ceilings

'Most of the house is covered in smoke soot and that might just take a few weekends there with a bit of elbow grease to get rid of.'

Mr Sulfaro said the air-conditioning ducts and electrical wiring would also need to be replaced.

He added that the house featured a mix of old and new features, including a renovated kitchen, bathroom and laundry, original timber floors and high metal press ornate ceilings.

Mr Sulfaro said under normal circumstances in St Peters $650,000 would get a homebuyer a modern one-bedroom apartment with a car space.

'I think this is probably the cheapest property on the market in the Inner West,' he said.

'I don't think you can get better value and I haven't seen better value all year.'  

Prior to the fire the house  would have easily sold for $950,000, the real estate agent said

An NRMA Insurance spokeswoman said in a statement: 'Mr. Noicos' home was damaged by a fire that was determined by Police to have been deliberately lit by Mr. Noicos' housemate.

'Because the fire was lit by a person authorised by Mr. Noicos to live in his home, his claim was declined in accordance with a general exclusion in his policy, listed in the product disclosure statement.'

NRMA said it  reviewed his claim and maintained its decision to decline it.

'We have provided him with a further option for the matter to be escalated,' the spokeswoman said.

'Alternatively, he can take the matter to the Financial Ombudsman Service, or seek legal advice.'

NRMA added that it doesn't cover any intentional act or omission by 'you, your family or someone who lives in your home — for example, the tenants' or 'someone who acts with your or your family's consent, or the consent of someone who lives in your home'.
