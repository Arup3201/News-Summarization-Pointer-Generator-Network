A blind stroke victim is suing police for damages after he was shot in the back with a 50,000-volt Taser stun gun by a police officer who mistook his white stick for a samurai sword.

Colin Farmer, 63, has today issued a compensation claim after he collapsed to the ground in shock and believed he might be dying from another stroke.

The blunder happened on October 12 last year after reports were received of a man walking through the town centre in Chorley, Lancashire, with a martial arts weapon.

Victim: Colin Farmer, 63, has issued a compensation claim after he was shot in the back with a Taser stun gun

Mr Farmer, who has suffered two strokes and walks at a 'snail’s pace', was on his way to a pub to meet friends for a drink and did not realise anything was wrong until the officer Tasered him.

He has sent a letter to Lancashire Constabulary today, claiming damages for assault, false imprisonment and a breach of his human rights.

He is also seeking a declaration of incompatibility from the High Court in relation to the use of the Taser.

Mr
Farmer’s ordeal began at 5.45pm when he was walking down an
alleyway to meet friends.

Officers had 
received reports of a man roaming around a town centre armed with a 
large sword. Minutes later, they swooped on Mr Farmer, wrongly assuming 
he was the swordsman.

The 
unnamed officer claimed he shouted for Mr Farmer to stop but when he 
carried on walking, opened fire only to realise his mistake.

Police later arrested a 27-year old man believed to be the real offender but he was released without charge after no weapon was found.

An investigation by the Independent Police Complaints Commission is ongoing.

Lancashire Police were unable to comment.

Innocent: Blind Mr Farmer was walking along Peter Street to meet his friends in a pub when the officer swooped

The real thing: A samurai sword of the type that Mr Farmer's stick was mistaken for by a police officer

In 2011 in the UK, Tasers were fired by police into suspects at least 
1,081 times, compared with 744 in 2010 – a 45 per cent rise.

In
June the Police Federation, which represents rank-and-file officers, 
wrote to the Prime Minister to demand that every front-line officer have
access to a Taser.

There are currently 12,000 Tasers on our streets but under the Federation plans that number would be increased to 36,000.
