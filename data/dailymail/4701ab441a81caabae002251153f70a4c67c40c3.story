Scotland legend Gordon McQueen has launched an astonishing attack on Aiden McGeady and James McCarthy – insisting they deserve ‘a horrible reception’ when they appear for Martin O’Neill’s Republic on Friday night.

The pair, both born and raised in Scotland, used the grandparent ruling to pledge their allegiance to the Republic of Ireland.

McGeady, who was born in Paisley, represented Scotland schools as a teenager before switching while Glasgow-born midfielder McCarthy also spurned numerous approaches to declare for Scotland, telling the SFA it was his Donegal-born grandfather’s dying wish that he represented Ireland.

James McCarthy was born and raised in Scotland but chose to play for the Republic of Ireland

But McQueen insists he has ‘no time’ for players who turn their backs on the country and the former Scotland and Manchester United defender wants the Tartan Army to make it as uncomfortable a night as possible for the Everton duo in Friday’s crunch Euro 2016 qualifier.

‘Will it be hard for them coming back here with Ireland? I really hope so,’ McQueen said. ‘I hope they get a horrible reception because they deserve it.

‘You’re either Scottish or you’re not Scottish - and you should know that by the time you’re 12 years of age. I’m sure somebody must have asked them to play for Scotland at some stage.

‘But, you’re born in Glasgow but then you go and play for somebody else? I hate that! What’s that all about? I’m not having that at all. I’ve got no time for these players.’

McGeady and McCarthy, who is an injury doubt ahead of Friday’s crucial encounter, were often met with a hostile reception at away grounds when they played in the SPL.

But Irish ace Stephen Hunt has warned the Tartan Army that booing McGeady and McCarthy will only motivate Martin O’Neill’s side.

He said: ‘I’ve played in local derbies where there is great hatred but I don’t think Ireland against Scotland qualifies as one of those. The treatment James McCarthy and Aiden McGeady get could turn the atmosphere into something more like a typical derby.

‘If they get the reception that’s expected, it will add to the tension and I know the Ireland players will respond.’

For McQueen, his anger against the pair is solely about his fervent pro-Scottishness and although he is also frustrated by players who use the Saltire as a flag of convenience.

Aiden McGeady also opted to play for the Irish

‘I played alongside the likes of Bob Wilson and Bruce Rioch, who were born in England but they always considered themselves Scottish. That’s all I want. If you feel Scottish then you’re Scottish!

‘I just hate these guys who think “I can’t get a game for England so I’ll play for Scotland”.’

McCarthy however has emerged as a major injury doubt for Friday night’s crunch qualifier.

The midfielder may not be able to feature after complaining of tightness in his hamstring following a 90-minute outing in Everton’s 1-1 draw with Sunderland yesterday.

Everton manager Roberto Martinez has revealed the ex-Hamilton player will undergo tests to determine his readiness for international duty.

‘We are going to assess James,’ said Martinez. ‘He was feeling his hamstring towards the end of the game but he wanted to stay on the pitch because we had used all three subs.

‘It is a bit of a concern because he had the same injury a few weeks back when he missed the game against Manchester United and it is in that area. We are hoping that it is more fatigue than a soft tissue problem.

‘We will assess him in the morning.’

O’Neill will confirm his final squad for the Scotland game today but has further concerns over centre-back Marc Wilson and back-up goalkeeper Kieren Westwood. The loss of Wilson, who limped out of Stoke’s match with Spurs yesterday with a hamstring injury, would be the more serious blow. He has been the regular partner for John O’Shea at the heart of the Irish defence in recent matches.

McQueen, who was capped 30 times and is in the Scottish Football Hall of Fame, believes that with a partisan Tartan Army behind Strachan’s side, the Scots will blow the Irish away on Friday.

But he admitted he will feel ‘ashamed’ if Scotland cannot end their exile from major finals and said: ‘I think we’ll beat Ireland at Celtic Park. There are certain grounds where the crowd just gets to the opposition. Celtic have had some very average sides over the years but European teams coming to Parkhead were always intimidated by the atmosphere.

Gordon McQueen hopes McGeady and McCarthy are given a 'horrible reception' when they take on Scotland

‘As long as I live I’ll never forget playing for Scotland against Wales at Anfield in 1977 in the game that took us to the World Cup finals.

‘That was intimidating. The stadium was literally bouncing, with Scotland fans everywhere you looked, even though it was their home game. We didn’t play well that night but we still won 2-0.

‘I think Gordon Strachan is showing he’s the ideal man for the Scotland job. Right now it looks as though everyone is on his side, regardless of the results. They’ve been all right but what if we end up finishing fourth in this group?

‘Personally, I think we will qualify but I would be ashamed if we didn’t because just about everybody gets to these finals – 24 countries. Surely we can do that?’
