Inexplicable: Friends and family say Celina Cass is the last person they would expect to run away

Police are desperately searching for an 11-year-old girl who disappeared from her bedroom three days ago.

Celina Cass was last seen playing on her computer at about 9pm on Monday. When her parents went to wake her up the next morning, she had vanished.

Her disappearance has shaken the small town of Stewartstown, New Hampshire, just a mile from the Canadian border, as police crews search the Connecticut River for any sign of the little girl.

There was no indication Celina had run away or was kidnapped, and there were no signs of a struggle.

Her
stepfather, Wendell Noyers, described the fifth-grader as a quiet girl 
who would never have left home by herself.

He declined to comment 
further, saying 'I'm not really at liberty to say anything.'

The FBI have now sent a specialist abduction team to join the search, but officials say they are still not treating her disappearance as suspicious and have not issued an Amber Alert.

There was a flurry of activity yesterday at the house she shares with her mother, stepfather and sister. Her father is said to be seriously ill in hospital.

Agents are believed to be trawling through Celina's phone and computer records.

But officials remain tight-lipped about their investigation. Senior Assistant Attorney General Jane Young said it is still being treated as a missing persons case, and added: 'We are still desperately looking for her.'

Yesterday an extensive land search was scaled back, and police trawled the Connecticut River using two boats.

They lowered the waterway 
so helicopters could scour it from the air, while officers desperately 
searching an area within a half-mile radius of her home.

Frantic search: Celina Cass vanished from her home in the small town of Stewartstown, New Hampshire

Around 80 friends and neighbours held a second vigil for Celina last night as they desperately prayed for her safe return. They gathered around a framed photograph of the schoolgirl on a picnic table, surrounded by candles.

They said Celina was the last person they'd expect to run away.

Fighting back tears and holding a lit
candle at the gathering last night, family friend Rebecca Goodrum said:
'She never went anywhere without her mom or sister.'

She said: 'She was beautiful. She was the light of everything.'

Another, Kayla Baglio, said: 'She is 
very shy. If she doesn't know you, she'd look at her sister to see if it
was OK to talk to you.

One of Celina's schoolfriends, 
11-year-old Makayla Riendeau, said she was very athletic and a stickler 
about getting her school work done on time.

She said: 'She's a very good friend, and she never lets anybody down.

Shannon Towles, who owns a mini-mart on Route 3, said her disappearance had shaken the town, which has just 800 residents.

She said: 'It's creepy. Things like this don't happen here. I know that's kind of a tired phrase. I'm an overprotective mom as it is. Now it's going to be way worse.'

Call for help: Family friends hold up missing posters for Celina for passing cars to view outside the family home

Hunt: A New Hampshire Fish and Game officer uses as GPS device as he searches for Celina along a road near her home in Stewartstown. An FBI abduction team has now joined the investigation

Mrs Towles said Celina wasn't the type 
of girl to hitchhike or run away. She said: 'She's just a little girl 
and she's a nice little girl.'

Celina attends Stewartstown Community School, where she is one of just 85 pupils.

The
district superintendent described her as popular and well-liked, and 
said six counsellors were on hand to help students cope with her 
disappearance.

Mrs Towles said her daughter, Echo, 
had asked her whether she thought Celina was still alive.

She said: 'How
do I answer that question? And do I want to? I don't want to think 
about it, but I pray every second that she is.'

Friends
and neighbours have spent the last two days posting flyers showing her 
smiling face on every available lamppost and tree trunk.

Hunt: Residents post flyers on trees in Stewartstown to help find Celina Cass, who disappeared from her home on Monday evening

Yesterday police searched the woods 
behind an apartment building about a mile north of the town. They 
carried bags and boxes, but it was unclear if they collected anything.

Later
officers went into Celina's home, then stretched yellow crime scene 
tape around it before posting a uniformed officer outside.

Then
plain clothes police officers wearing purple rubber gloves surrounded a
red pick-up truck parked across the street from the house, taking 
photographs and looking inside.

Shaken: Celina is one of just 85 pupils at the town's school. Counsellors are on hand to help students cope with her disappearance

Lieutenant Douglas Gralenski, a state
Fish and Game Department official helping to search the river, said: 
'Honestly, we don't know where else we can look. There's so much that's 
unknown.'

He said: 'It's not a deep river. You'd be hard-pressed to find six to eight feet in 
most of it in that area. When we had it drawn down, it was 
exceptionally low.'

The investigation has now been passed on to the New Hampshire Attorney General's Office.
