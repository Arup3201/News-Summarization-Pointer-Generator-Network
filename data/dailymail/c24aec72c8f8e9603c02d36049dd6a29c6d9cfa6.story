A teenage snowboarder is suing board maker Burton after he was paralysed while trialling a snowboard.

Michael Coady, 16, is also suing Wentworth Ski Resort after he fell and broke his neck at the venue in Nova Scotia, Canada..

Mr Coady, who must now use a wheelchair, is suing Burton and the ski resort for negligence claiming that they failed to warn him of the dangers of using the snowboard and failing to verify his age.

Burton was offering free energy drinks and a trial of their new snowboards in February 2008 when Mr Coady signed a waiver and skied into the terrain park to try out the board and crashed.

He claimed that the resort did not supervise boarders testing the Burton boards or warn them of dangers of using the terrain park which included rails, jumps and hills.

The defendants argued there was not sufficient evidence to go to trial but the judge dismissed it, preserving Mr Coady’s right to a trial.

Burton had appealed earlier this year but the resort did not and a trial date has yet to be set.

In January this year Caleb Moore, an 
innovative freestyle snowmobile rider who was hurt in a horrific crash 
at the Winter X Games in Colorado, died aged 25.

Mr Moore was attempting a back-flip last Thursday in the freestyle event when the skis on his 450lb snowmobile caught the lip of the landing area, sending him flying over the handlebars. 

Mr Moore landed face first into the snow with his snowmobile rolling over him.

He stayed down for quite some time, before walking off with help and going to a hospital to treat his concussion.

Mr Moore developed bleeding around his heart and was flown to a hospital in Grand Junction for surgery.

The family later said that Moore, of Krum, Texas, also had a complication involving his brain.

Last year sports teacher Mike Siddall, from Bollington in Cheshire defied doctors' dire predictions by learning to walk, run and board again after he faced life in a wheelchair after a snowboarding accident.

He was 23 and an experienced boarder on an instructor’s course in Sass Fee, Switzerland, when he fell and fractured his spine.

He was flown to a hospital for a major operation to insert metal bars in his spine, where specialists told him he was completely paralysed and unlikely to ever walk again.
