Moving on? TOWIE's Lauren Goodger is rumoured to be taking part in this year's Celebrity Big Brother

Amy Childs and Kirk Norcross both waved goodbye to their cast mates in The Only Way Is Essex when they signed up to star in Celebrity Big Brother.

And now speculation has surfaced that Lauren Goodger is set to do the same thing.

But doing little to rid the rumours, the reality TV star remained coy when she was asked if she'll be entering the house tomorrow.

When asked about the rumours she told OK.co.uk:' I don't know what I can and can not say but at the minute I'm still in TOWIE.'

And addressing other reports about here leaving the ITV show for programmes such as Strictly Come Dancing, she reaffirmed: 'I'm still about of TOWIE so it's not something I can comment on at the moment.'

But questioned about who her ideal housemate would be if she did ever go into the house, she quickly named Magic Mike star Channing Tatum.

'I've been in TOWIE since day one and I think when it's right it's right I'm going to make my decision to what I'm going to do obviously I'm going to plan ahead but we'll have to wait and see.'

During a recent interview with Yahoo OMG, Big Brother host Brian Dowling hinted that Goodger may be taking part in the new series.

'Someone just said to me that they heard Lauren Goodger was going in,' said 34-year-old contestant turned host.

'People will want to see her fall in love - that would be quite nice. She's been quite unlucky in love, with the whole Mark Wright stuff and trying to date on the show.'

If the 25-year-old salon owner did make 
the move and join the line up for this year's CBB, it would make her the
sixth original cast member to leave TOWIE.

And although she has failed to deny or 
confirm whether or not she'll be leaving the show, she has spent the 
past week uploading pictures to her Twitter account documenting the last
few years of her rise to stardom.

11 hours, she retweeted a post on the 
micro-blogging site which read: 'Your past is done, so forget it, your 
future is yet to come, so dream it, but your present is now, so live it 
with no regrets!'

Her decision to move on from the ITV show also wouldn't come as a surprise because in April it was reported that she had been axed after allegedly throwing her weight around.

After
a showdown with bosses as the cast and crew filmed scenes in a nightclub, Lauren was believed to have been told that she would not be 
shooting any more scenes for the show.

According to The Sun,
Lauren, 25, accused producers of treating her badly and said she was 
the real star of the show and threatened to leave and join MTV so she 
and her sister could become the British 'Kardashians'.

Speculation mounting: As rumours heighten she's sett o join this week's Celebrity Big Brother, Lauren was spotted earlier today out with a TOWIE producer to confuse things further

Will she? Lauren even wrote on Twitter today that she had bought a new dress for a 'special occasion' - could it be her entry outfit?

As of yet, producers of Celebrity Big Brother have made sure not to reveal any housemates as it is a close guarded secret and are going to extreme length to keep it that way.

There has however been hearsay that Coleen Nolan, Spandau Ballet's Martin Kemp, Duane Chapman aka Dog the Bounty Hunter, So Solid Crew's MC Harvey, who recently made headlines over his relationship with Cheryl Cole and Simon Cowell's ex Jasmine Lennard will all feature in this year's lineup.

Other potential house mates rumoured to 
be making an appearance include comedian Julian Clary, Coronation Street
legend Julie Goodyear and controversial journalist Samantha Brick.

Yesterday Celebrity Big Brother bosses were 
took no chances when they delivered one of the contestants to a London
hotel ahead of the show's launch night.

But their 'fool proof' disguise of a balaclava and sunglasses left little doubt as to who it could be.

EastEnders actress Cheryl Fergison 
has long been rumoured to be one of those entering the CBB house on 
Wednesday - and this get-up did little to dispel the speculation.

The 48-year-old emerged from a car at the top secret hotel wearing baggy white trousers and a flowing, patterned vest top.

She was also carrying a Co Op plastic bag, thought to contain her cosmetics.

The actress played Heather Trott in the BBC1 soap opera, before her character was killed off earlier this year by Ben Mitchell.

Celebrity Big Brother returns tomorrow at 9pm on Channel 5.
