An iconic quote attributed to Andy Warhol - 'In the future, everyone will be famous for 15 minutes' - may not have actually been said by the influential  pop artist.

The painter, sculptor and film maker, who died in 1987, was first credited with the phrase in a brochure at a 1968 exhibition of his work in Sweden.

But prominent art critic Blake Glopnik has now cast doubt on its origins, citing the 1997 reminisences of fellow art expert and curator Ole Granath who   was an assistant on the Warhol retrospective, held in Stockholm.

Andy Warhol (right) may not have actually said: 'In the future, everyone will be famous for 15 minutes', according to an art critic

The show's curator, Pontus Hulten, had told him to include 'In the future everyone will be world-famous for 15 minutes' in the catalogue's compendium of   Warhol quotes.

Granath found no record of the quote. even after extensive research. 'If he didn't say it, he very well could have. Let's put it in,' Hulten reportedly   said.

Writing in the Warholiana blog, Glopnik said: 'So Andy's phrase was actually Hulten's – not so surprising, given that Hulten later faked some Warhol Brillo   boxes.'

Other accounts throw add further mystery to the origins of the quote.  Philip Pearlstein, who was at art school with Warhol, revealed to Glopnik that he'd said something similar himself in 1946, when the two artists first   met.

Warhol, still a teenager, asked Pearlstein what it was like to be the winner of a national art competition for high school students.

Warhol may have first heard a similar version of the phrase when he was just a teenager

Pearlstein said: 'My spontaneous answer was, 'It only lasted five minutes'.'

In 2005 photographer Nat Finkelstein claimed he was the source of the line.

In 1965, during an outdoor photoshoot with Warhol, some people tried to   push into the shot.

'Andy's looking at them and he says to me, "Gee whiz, Nat, everybody wants to be famous",' said Finkelstein.

'I say back, "Yeah, for about 15 minutes, Andy". He took that line. My quote became Andy Warhol's famous words.'

However, in a book he published in 1989, Finkelstein said the artist had uttered the famous words during the shoot, making no mention of Warhol stealing   his line.

Glopnik says the murkiness of the phrase's origins fit in with the way Warhol took influences from a variety of sources.

'By the late 1970s, Warhol himself was mentioning the line (not always clearly as his) at various times and in various places and in various weird   versions, even saying that he's grown bored with it,' he said.

'But that doesn't tell us much about whether he came up with it in the first place: Warhol, the world's greatest sponge, would hardly have proclaimed   that he hadn't coined his trademark aphorism. Warhol's art and persona were all about the rewards of his sponging.'

This line never appeared in any of Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's written works. In 1893's The Crooked Man, the words appear, but are separated by several lines of dialogue and are in the wrong order.

He actually said the words, but the meaning has been taken out of context. Durocher was asked his opinion of the 1946 New York Giants and replied: 'Take a look at them. All nice guys. They’ll finish last. Nice guys – finish last.'
