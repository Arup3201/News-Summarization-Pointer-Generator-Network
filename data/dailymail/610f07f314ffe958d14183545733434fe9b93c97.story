Manchester City defender Eliaquim Mangala has confessed he was unaware he was part-owned by two investment firms.

Both Doyen Sports Investments (DSI) and Robi Plus Ltd (RPL) owned a percentage of Mangala whilst at Porto before his £32million summer transfer to the Etihad.

Doyen Sports is an investment fund supported by a collection of wealthy but anonymous businessmen speculating on the purchase of footballers to make money.

Clueless: The France international was unaware two investment firms had ownership rights over him at Porto

Instead of buying up players’ economic rights, as with other third-party ownership schemes, Doyen loan money to clubs to assist in transfers of notable targets who would otherwise be unaffordable.

DSI claimed a third of the France international’s transfer fee to Manchester City having assisted Porto with his move in 2011.

Asked about DSI’s involvement, Mangala incredibly revealed to the Sun: ‘I didn’t know about it. I wasn’t in the loop. I learnt about it from the media. I wasn’t consulted before.’

Furthermore, it has been revealed RPL owned an additional 10 per cent and asked whether he knew, Mangala said ‘No, not at all.’

Speaking on France 2’s Cash Investigation Programme, Mangala didn’t seem too concerned and said: ‘In effect, we are financial products. You have to be realistic. We bring value to that enterprise.

‘Each of us has a market value which can go up or go down according to performance.’
