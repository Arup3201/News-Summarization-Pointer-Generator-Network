With its tips on styling the 'wedge' and the 'flick', gentle celebrity gossip and advice on how to snare the boy next door, 70s teen magazine, Jackie, was the lifestyle bible for a generation of girls.

Although the title folded in 1993, it remains one of the most popular teen titles ever made, selling 600,000 copies a week at the peak of its popularity.

Half a century after it first launched, Jackie is back in the news with commentators offering a retrospective look at the title and what it meant to them as the magazine's 50th birthday approaches.

Familiar: Early editions, including this May 1964 copy, featured familiar names such as Paul McCartney

Writing in the Telegraph, journalist Victoria Lambert remembers the 'fabulous mix of fashion, photo stories, pop gossip and beauty tips' offered to teen readers.

She adds: 'Where else could a girl from Middle England learn about the merits of triple denim, especially in waistcoat form, as modelled by Status Quo?'

But as regular readers knew, there was more to Jackie than triple denim and pop gossip. The magazine also broke new ground by including sex and relationship advice - introduced after contraception was made free on the NHS in 1974.

Its 'Dear Doctor' column covered everything from information on periods to how to avoid getting pregnant with much more in between.

Groundbreaking: Jackie, which folded in 1993, was one of the first to include content on sex and relationships

Speaking to the BBC, Maria Welch, who worked on Jackie from 1987 to 1992, explained: 'Jackie was the blueprint for the teenage magazines that we see today.

'When Jackie was selling millions of copies in the 1970s, I think lots of teenagers were feeling a bit disconnected.

'There was no internet, there was no social networking so it was very difficult to find out if your problems were ones you were having alone, or were other girls having them too?'

Although modern teen magazines have struggled, with market leader Sugar going entirely online in 2011, the legacy of Jackie - and nostalgia for its 70s heyday - remains.

As Taylor puts it: 'No wonder the magazineâ€™s nostalgia market survives with annuals and CD compilations still available.

'Who else is yet to be discovered wearing a tight pullover and a winsome expression in its pages? A young Tony Blair?' One can only hope not.

Still popular: Another favourite cover star was Cliff Richard, who remains popular with older ladies today
