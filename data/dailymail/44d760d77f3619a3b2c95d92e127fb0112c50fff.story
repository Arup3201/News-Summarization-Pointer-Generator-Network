Jamie Carragher believes there must be underlying reasons for Alan Pardew to leave Newcastle United for south London as 'Crystal Palace will never be as big as' the Magpies.

Pardew is close to completing a return to Palace, where he spent the best years of his playing career as a midfielder, after Newcastle accepted a £2million compensation package for their manager.

But he is leaving a club safely in mid-table mediocrity - with his former charges sitting ninth in the table - for a side battling for Premier League survival and struggling in the relegation zone.

The curiosity of such a move leads Carragher to believe Pardew is simply fed up with the way he has been treated at St James' Park by owner Mike Ashley and the supporters.

Former Liverpool defender Carragher said on Sky Sports: 'I'm less surprised than Gary (Neville that Pardew would move to Selhurst Park).

'Crystal Palace will never be as big as Newcastle, so why would he move?

'The fans don't particularly like him. Does he get enough support from above? They sold (Yohan) Cabaye, could they lose (Moussa) Sissoko, (Papiss) Cisse?

'He's been there for a long time, how long can you stay? They're a much bigger club, of course they are, but how long can you stay?

'His family still live down there (in London) and he may see this as a big opportunity to make a stamp on a club whereas he can't at Newcastle because of the constraints on him.'

Palace sit 18th in the table and Pardew will find himself thrust straight into a relegation scrap at Selhurst Park.

Ex-Manchester United defender Gary Neville thinks that Pardew's decision is due to the 'survival game' that is being a manager of a Premier League club.

Speaking on Sky Sports, he said: 'Management is all about risk, they're taking risks and gambling all the time.

'I said I would be surprised (when I heard the news) yesterday but I don't know the inside track. Maybe I'm thinking too purely and the long contract isn't there for him to see out. Management is a survival game.

'Newcastle fans will find out now how good Pardew was, or not.

'I know Newcastle fans have massive aspirations and they're a good club but I think the money that has been spent (during his reign), Pardew has delivered par seasons and above-par seasons except the year they were in the Europa League.

'He can see that Palace are a club he knows well and maybe can see an opportunity there.'

Pardew played more than 100 games for Palace during a four-year spell at the south London club
