The trainers of Sire De Grugy and Sprinter Sacre have both issued positive reports on their absent stars ahead of the 888sport Tingle Creek Chase at Sandown.

Nicky Henderson said Sprinter Sacre had successfully worked with 2013 Cheltenham Gold Cup winner Bobs Worth on the Lambourn gallops on Friday.

While Gary Moore said Sire De Grugy will be ridden for the first time in three weeks on Monday.

Speaking at Sandown, where he won the Winter Novices’ Hurdle with Vyta Du Roc and juvenile hurdle with Bivouac, Henderson could not conceal his frustration at suggestions that Sprinter Sacre will never fully recover from the fibrillating heart issue which caused him to be pulled up in the Desert Orchid Chase at Kempton’s 2013 Christmas meeting.

The Lambourn trainer said: ‘He was really good this morning but no-one will believe me. He and Bobs Worth went a mile and a half and I was delighted with both of them.

‘Most people think he doesn’t exist so I just do it own my own to amuse myself.’

Asked if the Desert Orchid Chase remained a possible comeback option, Henderson added: ‘Everything is a possibility but there is no rush.’

Sire De Grugy was ruled out for the rest of the year after scans last month revealed a hip problem.

Moore said: ‘He will start being ridden again on Monday for 10 days. We then re-scan and, hopefully, progress from there.’

Paul Nicholls-trained Saphir Du Rheu is 8-1 (JLT Chase) and 12-1 (RSA Chase) with Coral after a first chase success at Exeter.

However, owner Andy Stewart, at Sandown to welcome winner As De Mee who he co-owns with actress Dame Judy Dench, favours the longer RSA Chase.

Richard Johnson has been banned for 12 days (December 19 to January 2) after taking the wrong course on pulled up Benbane Head in the Devon Marathon at Exeter.

He misses the Christmas programme including the mount on Menorah in the King George VI Chase at Kempton on Boxing Day.
