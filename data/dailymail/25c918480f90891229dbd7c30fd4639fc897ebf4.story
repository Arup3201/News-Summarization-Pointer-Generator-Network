Sweden born photographer Martin Adolfsson traveled to 44 mini-mansions in five different continents to photograph the rise of the upper middle class across the globe and its impact on suburban home design.Adolfsson's photography project, 'Suburbia Gone Wild' documents suburban homes in Bankonk, Shanghai, Bangalore,Cairo, Moscow, Johannesburg, Sao Paolo, and Mexico City. His book, which he self-published this year and can be purchased on Amazon, pays particular attention to these regions because they are the suburbs outside of the world's developing economic hubs. Slate reports that Adolfsson, who is now based in New York City, first had the idea to start the project while traveling to Bankok where he was enrolled in a photography workshop. 'I was stunned to spot a suburban sub development amidst the landscape outside of the city,' he told Slate about looking out of the window of the plane while it was landing.

His website says that the homes in Bankok reminded him of the 'cookie-cutter houses that resembled structures in his home country of Sweden.'

He told Slate he was allowed to go back to the suburb called Parkway Chatlet that he spotted on the plane . 'In spite of the gates, I was allowed access without any question,' he said. The project's website states, 'Suburbia Gone Wild provides a fascinating window into one of the greatest structural changes of the 21st-century, the rise of the upper middle class in the developing world. Exploring the search for identity among this new strata of society, Adolfsson takes us where they live: the shiny, newly-developed suburbs surrounding the new economic centers of the world.'In 2008, Adolfsson received three grants  for his project but was faced with the dilemma of gaining access to the suburban homes. After sending numerous letters asking for permission to photograph, he received some disheartening responses.

'Responses ranged everywhere from no answer at all to "Thank you for your request, we are reviewing it but we want final approval and full supervision," and I realized that those restrictions would set the project in an entirely different and limited direction,' he told Slate.

He decided to visit the homes, not as a photographer, but as an interested buyer. He went as far as to hire local residents to pretend to be his spouse or colleague. He would let his assistants so all the talking while he only had several minutes to shoot a few photos.

'Because the images were captured in this semi-clandestine way, there wasn’t much time reflect as I was working; at most locations, I only had five or 10 minutes to shoot,' he told Slate.

His website says of the project, 'His approach is best described as a combination of positively amusing and awkwardly eerie, as he documents a curious phenomenon that looks more and more like the constructed world of The Truman Show.'

All Adolfsson's photographs were taken with a SLR camera without professional lighting. Adolfsson attributes the quality of the photos to the fact that the homes have a sense of familiarity and are 'made to be easily captured.' 'There is a lot of uncertainty as the global economy expands and cultural borders continue to dissolve. People seek out common experience and comfort, and perhaps these model homes reflect pop culture as a uniting common denominator,' Adolfsson told Slate.

The artist also has an upcoming project called 'Geographic Proximity' which explores the relationship between the ever changing landscape and the society we live in. More Information about Martin Adolfsson and his work can be found on his website.
