The American Ebola victims have said they would not hesitate to treat patients with the virus again.

Dr. Kent Brantly, Nancy Writebol, Dr. Rick Sacra, Amber Vinson, Nina Pham and Ashoka Mukpo appeared on the Today show on Tuesday morning for their first ever joint interview.  

They were not joined by Dr Craig Spencer, a Doctors Without Borders physician who was diagnosed with the virus after returning to New York City from Guinea. He was released earlier this month.

Most of the group had been working with Ebola victims in West Africa or in the U.S. when they contracted Ebola, but when asked if they would do the same again, it was unanimous 'yes'.

'Nursing is a calling and it's such a rewarding career,' said Nina Pham, who contracted the virus while treating a patient in Dallas, Texas. 'It's in our personalities and our nature to help.'

Ashoka Mukpo, an NBC News video journalist who contracted Ebola while working in Liberia, quipped: 'I wish I had used a little bit more chlorine.'

Writebol, who contracted the virus in July while on a missionary trip to Liberia, added that she would even 'possibly' return to carry out further aid work.

Dr Sacra, a married dad-of-three who also contracted the virus in Liberia, agreed he would return.

A few of the former patients - Dr. Rick Sacra,  Nina Pham and Ashoka Mukpo - had fought the virus after getting plasma donations from Dr. Brantly.

Brantly, 33, and Writebol, 59, were both in Liberia when they contracted Ebola and were flown back to Emory Hospital in Atlanta, where they both recovered and were released.

Brantly's blood was then used to cure other patients.

'I just want to say thank you,' Mukpo said to Brantly on Today. 'It's a good opportunity to express my appreciation for what you did. It's just amazing that you gave so much to all of us.'

Pham added: 'He's a selfless man and he's like our angel. He gave us a second chance at life.'

But Brantly responded with characteristic modesty, saying: 'I think God saved my life and I have a responsibility to use my life in a way that is glorifying to Him and helpful to other people.

'It was an honor and a privilege but also just a natural thing to help others.'

His blood had not proved a match with that of Thomas Eric Duncan, the first person in the U.S. to be diagnosed with Ebola and who later died. Pham and Vinson contracted Ebola while treating him.

Another high-profile survivor was Pham's dog Bentley, a King Charles Cavalier Spaniel, who was put in quarantine after concerns he might have contracted Ebola.

But he showed no traces of the virus and has now been reunited with Pham, 26.

'He gets more questions than people ask about me,' she said, laughing. 'He just celebrated his second birthday.'

She and the other survivors said that while some people had been extremely supportive following their diagnoses, they had also been bombarded with abuse from others, who deemed them careless.

'There's been a lot of scrutiny,' Dr. Rick Sacra, 51, said. 'We've all been under a magnifying glass or under a microscope for the past couple of months. There's a lot of criticism on social media that you see.' 

Recovered: They were not joined by Dr Craig Spencer, who was diagnosed with Ebola in NYC

They agreed that they believe some people will always keep their distance from them - with Mukpo quipping that he believes they'll get pretty good seats on future plane journeys. 

Another former patient to receive criticism was Vinson, who contracted the virus while working in Dallas and then - unaware she had it - flew to Ohio to plan her wedding before returning to Texas.

The 29-year-old has previously said she would never have boarded the planes if she felt ill.

Now she is looking forward to marrying her fiance, and shared photographs with the Today show of them together in front of their Christmas tree.

'It gave me hope [that other people had survived],' she said.

'I knew that it was a struggle but.. [medical staff] told me there would be rough days but there are others who have made it through.'

At the conclusion of the interview, the group expressed their thanks to family, friends and strangers who have offered their support over the past few months.

Mukpo added: 'I'm thankful for all the brave men and women in Liberia, Guinea and Sierra Leone who put their lives at risk to deal with this epidemic. They're the real heroes.'
