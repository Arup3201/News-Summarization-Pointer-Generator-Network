Dozens of mourners gathered in Egypt's second largest city Alexandria for the funeral of a female political activist who was allegedly killed by police during a peaceful demonstration in central Cairo on Saturday.

Shaima al-Sabbagh, 32, was hit in the head as police fired birdshot ammunition, a supposedly non-lethal alternative to shot gun pellets, into the crowd to disperse the march.

Ms al-Sabbagh, the mother of a five-year-old boy, was shot while she marched towards the Tahrir Square to lay a commemorative wreath on the eve of the anniversary of the 2011 uprising against Hosni Mubarak.

Life lost: Ms Al-Sabbagh, a member of the Socialist Popular Alliance party was taken to a hospital where she was declared dead

Ms al-Sabbagh, from Alexandria was taken to a hospital where she was declared dead on Saturday. 

Videos posted online show Ms al-Sabbagh in a group of protesters carrying placards and chanting 'bread, freedom and social justice' - the chief slogan of the 2011 uprising.

She and others carried wreaths of roses they intended to place at nearby Tahrir Square, the birthplace of the uprising, in memory of the fallen protesters.

In the videos, two masked, black-clad police officers point their rifles in her direction before gunshots ring out and Ms al-Sabagh falls.

Ms al-Sabbagh, a member of the Socialist Popular Alliance Party who organised the peaceful march on Saturday, was photographed the moment she was hit.

Prime Minister Ibrahim Mahlab said al-Sabbagh's death was being investigated and vowed that 'whoever committed a mistake will be punished, whoever he may be.'

The prominent Hisham Mubarak Law Center said in a Facebook post that five of Ms al-Sabbagh's fellow protesters who had given investigators their account of the incident were charged with assaulting police and taking part in an illegal demonstration.

The interior ministry said it was investigating the death, but suggested Islamist 'infiltrators' were to blame. 

The Socialist Popular Alliance Party released a statement on Sunday, blaming Cairo police for  Ms al-Sabbagh's death.

Today marks the fourth anniversary of the 2011 uprising against Hosni Mubarak as part of the Arab Spring.

By Sunday afternoon, Egyptian security officials said clashes between police and Islamist protesters in an eastern Cairo district have left nine demonstrators dead, taking the total death toll to 11.

They say the Sunday clashes in the Matariyah area also injured 13.

Authorities had tightened security in Cairo and other cities ahead of today's anniversary after Islamists called for protests against the government of President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi, the former army chief who ousted Islamist president Mohamed Morsi in 2013. 

Sunday's anniversary of the uprising against Mubarak is a test of whether Islamists and liberal activists have the resolve to challenge Egypt's U.S.-backed government once again.

As mourners gathered for Ms al-Sabbagh's funeral, police shot and killed 'an armed pro-Muslim Brotherhood protester' in Alexandria.

The man has been 'shooting randomly with an automatic rifle while marching with a number of pro-Muslim Brotherhood supporters in Alexandria's Al-Awayed district,' Egyptian media reports.

Police also arrested another man with an automatic rifle, also in the march, along with two men who had Molotov cocktails,according to an interior ministry statement. 

Security forces have been stamping out dissent since the army ousted president Mohamed Mursi of the Muslim Brotherhood in July 2013 after mass protests against his rule. 

Dozens of protesters were killed during last year's anniversary of the revolt centred in Cairo's Tahrir Square. 

Separately, a bomb targeted policemen stationed outside a Cairo sports club, the sources said.

In the Nile Delta region of Baheira, about 170 km (104 miles) from Cairo, two militants were killed when bombs they were planting exploded, state television reported.

In Cairo, riot police backed by soldiers in armoured vehicles sealed off strategic roads, including ones leading to Tahrir Square.

Mursi supporters gathered near Tahrir and held up photographs of him, a witness said. Security forces rounded them up. They also used teargas to disperse a protest in Cairo's Ramses Square, officials said.

In the Cairo suburb of Matariya, security forces fired teargas as around 900 people protested.

Security forces were also dispatched to Rabaa Square in northeast Cairo, where hundreds of Mursi supporters were killed in August 2013 at a protest camp.

Islamists have been calling for protests today,  to revive what they say was the 'revolution' that overthrew Mubarak.

 It also briefly brought to power Islamist president Mohamed Morsi who was toppled by the then army chief Sisi in July 2013. 

Morsi's supporters often hold small rallies that police quickly disperse.

On Friday, an 18-year-old female protester was killed in clashes in the Mediterranean city of Alexandria. Police had warned they would confront protests 'decisively.'

Authorities have cracked down on the Islamists since the military overthrew Morsi after a year in power, and hundreds have been killed in clashes.

Scores of policemen and soldiers have also been killed in militant attacks.

Bird shot is designed to be used in shotgun shells and consist of spheres of metal, or bb's, that can be packed into a shell and which separate when fired.

It was originally made from lead, but is now made from steel, tungsten and other materials.

The amunintion was designed for shooting birds but it can injure larger animals. In 2006 American Vice-President Dick Cheney accidentally shot a fellow hunter with it. His victim was not severely injured.

Birdshot is used by law enforcement as a non-lethal alternative to shot gun pellets and is often used in riot and protest situations. 

Police also replace the slugs with rubber bullets. 

The crackdown has also extended to leftwing and secular dissidents who initially supported Morsi's overthrow but have since turned against the new authorities, accusing them of being authoritarian. 

Yesterday's central Cairo protest was organised by the Socialist Popular Alliance party.

Party member Adel el-Meligy said: 'The party decided to hold a symbolic protest to commemorate the anniversary of the January 25 revolution.'

He said police fired tear gas, birdshot and arrested the party's secretary general and five other young members.

The 18-day anti-Mubarak revolt had been fuelled by police abuses and the corruption of the strongman's three decade rule, but the police have since regained popularity amid widespread yearning for stability.

Activists, including those who spearheaded the anti-Mubarak revolt, have accused Sisi of reviving aspects of the former autocrat's rule.

Sisi and his supporters deny such allegations, and point to his widespread popularity and support for a firm hand in dealing with protests, which are seen as damaging to an economic recovery.

The anniversary will be marked just days after a court ordered the release of Mubarak's two sons, Gamal and Alaa, pending a corruption retrial along with their father.

Another court had dismissed charges against Hosni Mubarak over the deaths of protesters.
