An 80-year-old woman saved the life of her 2-year-old great-grandson when a tornado ripped through their home and tossed their entwined bodies onto a nearby highway. 

The senior, Betty Stewart, saved young Zane McFarland by wrapping him in a blanket and lying down on top of him. She was babysitting him while his parents were at work when the tornado tore through Northwest Georgia on Wednesday. 

'She said to Zane, "I'm not going to let you go,"' said Stewart's nephew, Kenneth Hayes, to wsbtv.com. 'She doesn't remember anything else, except somebody found her in the road. She remembers somebody talking to her when she was out in the middle of the road, and she didn't let go of him.'

The tornado had lifted the toddler's home in Gordon County, Georgia off its foundation and carried it about 50 feet toward the highway where Stewart was found still clutching baby Zane.

Zane survived the storm with a broken leg while his great-grandmother suffered a broken back in two places and a broken leg.

'The skin is gone from one hand down to her elbow,' Hayes said, describing Stewart's injuries. 'She has bleeding on the brain, cuts all over. She's black and blue all over.'

Both Zane and Stewart underwent surgery at Erlanger Hospital in Chattanooga, Tenn. and are recovering.

Zane's father, Daren McFarland, said he can't even begin to describe how grateful he is to his grandmother for saving his son's life. 

'Words cannot explain what my grandmother did,' he said. 'If it wasn't for God and her, my son wouldn't be here.'

'I love her to death,' he added.

He said Zane, who will be forced to wear a body cast for three months, is recovering well. 

'He's just our happy little boy,' he said. 'He's our miracle boy.'
