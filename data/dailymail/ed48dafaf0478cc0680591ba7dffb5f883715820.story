Alexis Sanchez is ready to throw a spanner in the works of Barcelona's attempts to sign Luis Suarez by refusing to join Liverpool.

Barca are keen to use the Chile international as a makeweight in their pursuit of Suarez - but Sanchez is understood to prefer a move to rivals Arsenal.

And Gunners boss Arsene Wenger is set to grant the South American his wish by launching a move for the attacking midfielder.

No go: Alexis Sanchez says he would rather join Arsenal than Liverpool

Barca officials have arrived in London to start formal talks with Liverpool over their interest in Suarez.

Liverpool, who are interested in Sanchez, want £80million for Suarez this summer.

The Catalan club are prepared to use Sanchez, who is valued at £30m, as a sweetener in their offer for Suarez.

But Sanchez looks likely to snub a move to Anfield, with his heart set on a switch to the Emirates Stadium.

That means only a straight cash deal for Suarez is likely to be enough to persuade Liverpool to sees their prolific striker.

Sources close to Sanchez have indicated that the 25-year-old would prefer a move to London, leaving Arsenal in pole position to land the talented forward.

Barca chiefs yesterday ramped up their interest in Suarez by making the astonishing move of praising the Liverpool striker following his biting controversy.

Barca chiefs are fully aware that the potential capture of Suarez could be viewed as a massive PR own goal given the furore surrounding the South American.

And the Catalan giants' took the unexpected step of praising Suarez for Monday's public apology to bite victim Giorgio Chiellini.

It is understood Barca chiefs encouraged Suarez, who initially denied biting the Italy defender, to make the apology behind the scenes in an attempt to improve his public image in Spain.

And Barca sporting director Andoni Zubizarreta said: 'Suarez has shown he is humble enough to admit an error, which is very important.

'He has been humble enough to apologise to those he has affected, because it happened in the middle of a festival of football.

'In this case it's the best thing a person can do.

'Everyone knows that Luis is an excellent player, everyone knows last season he played in various positions in attack, but everyone also knows that he is a Liverpool player.'

And the praise of Suarez from Catalonia didn't stop there as the club's latest signing, Ivan Rakitic, also patted the striker on the back for his apology.

The Croatian was officially unveiled at the Nou Camp yesterday and he said: 'The fact he has had the character and the strength to go in front of everyone and say sorry says a lot about him as a person.

'Not every person has that strength to admit they have done something stupid. I rarely say that I am wrong so this says a lot about him, he has shown the character and strength he has so he should be commended for that.

'Regardless of whether the club signs him or not, his quality is unquestionable. He has shown a lot of quality with Uruguay and scored more than 30 goals (last season) with Liverpool, so he has the necessary quality to play for Barca.'
