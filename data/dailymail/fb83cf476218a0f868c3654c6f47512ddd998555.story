Britain's ageing House of Lords has just two peers under the age of 40, but 29 members who have turned 90, new analysis reveals.

Amid fresh debate over whether peers should be axed in favour of an elected chamber, new figures show more than half of its members are over 70.

Lib Dem peer Lord Tyler, who is 73, said it was proof Parliament is being used as 'London's best day centre for the elderly' with 'mediocre' people clocking in for £300-a-day, tax free.

There are just two peers in their thirties, but 29 or are 90 years old or older, new analysis shows

Campaigners argue the need for reform has grown as political parties have packed it with more and more members.

The average age for men in the UK is 38 and women 40, according to the 2011 Census. But the average age in the House of Lords is well over 70.

It means that half the population is aged under 40, and not represented in the upper house of Parliament.

Just 16 per cent of people in the UK is aged over 65, but more than half of the Lords are over 70.

The figures were compiled by Lord Tyler, a former Lib Dem MP and supporter for Lords reform.

Writing for MailOnline, he warned: 'The Lords gets bigger, staler and less legitimate with each passing day.'

While some peers worked hard to improve the nation's law-making, 'there are also quite a lot of mediocre people picking up £300 a day (tax-free!) just for turning up and shuffling off,' he claimed.

'No amount of flummery about what 'noble' Lords they are makes up for it and for a century liberals have been attempting to stop the rot.'

The oldest peer is former Labour Chancellor Lord Healey (97) and the youngest is David Cameron's Big Society tsar Lord Wei (37)

Labour leader Ed Miliband this month unveiled his own plans to abolish the upper chamber and replace it with an elected senate.

He said that he wants to ensure the new body properly represents all the towns, cities, regions and nations that make up the United Kingdom.

But the plans drew an angry response from the Liberal Democrats who bitterly accused Labour of joining with Conservative MPs to wreck their plans to reform the Lords two years ago.

The Lib Dems argue the coalition committed to Lords reform when it was formed in 2010, but the Tories failed to deliver.

According to the figures, there are no peers in their twenties and just two in their thirties.

The youngest peer is Conservative Lord Wei, 37, a former adviser to David Cameron who championed the Big Society.

The oldest is Lord Healey, the former Labour Chancellor and deputy leader, who turned 97 in August.

Labour leader Ed Miliband this month called for reform of the Lords, but is accused of blocking a previous attempt to replace it with an elected senate

The largest group are the peers in their seventies, numbering 290 in total, followed by the sixty-somethings (249) and those in their eighties (136).

Labour has said that it would summon a constitutional convention early in the next parliament to consider how an elected senate would be established - including whether it could have specific regional representation functions.

Each region of England, as well as the devolved administrations of Scotland, Wales, and Northern Ireland, would hold meetings before the convention where people would be asked for views on the functions of the new body, as well as the most appropriate form of election.

But Lord Tyler accused Mr Miliband of forgetting that 'it was he who played party games with right-wing Tory MPs to torpedo' plans for reform.

'Without his shameless, spineless partisanship in 2012, British citizens would be preparing to choose the first elected members of the Lords in just seven months' time,' Lord Tyler added. 

Lib Dem peer Lord Tyler warned that the Lords gets bigger, staler and less legitimate with each passing day

Statisticians have discovered one sliver of society in which octogenarians substantially outnumber those in their forties. 

It's one half of Parliament and London's best day centre for the elderly – the House of Lords.

An appointment to the Lords is a job-for-life given disproportionately to those who live long and well. The result: the average age remains stubbornly over 70. 

Even with 183 new appointments since 2010, and a stonking 408 under Brown and Blair, there are only 32 members of the Lords under fifty, but still 165 over eighty. 29 of them are in their nineties while only two are a day under forty!

Plenty of peers seriously decide whether or not to challenge the government in close votes based on whether doing so will affect their plans for dinner. 

Of course there are a lot good people working very hard: I know many of them. 

But there are also quite a lot of mediocre people picking up £300 a day (tax-free!) just for turning up and shuffling off. No amount of flummery about what 'noble' Lords they are makes up for it and for a century liberals have been attempting to stop the rot.

Yet Ed Miliband burst out of his paper bag last week to discover the urgency of reform as though he stood at the very beginning of history, with nothing behind him. He wants the Lords to be 'truly a Senate of the Regions and Nations of our whole country.' 

What a good idea! The Coalition Cabinet proposed exactly that in a Government Bill just two years ago. Ed seems to have forgotten that it was HE who played party games with right-wing Tory MPs to torpedo it.

No more able to lead his party than a rat could herd cats, he decided to take a cheap shot at Nick Clegg – the one thing Labour MPs all agree they like doing. 

Knowing he would sink the best chance of democracy for decades, Ed piously claimed to support reform 'in principle' but refused outright to back ANY timetable motion to get it through the Commons. 

Without his shameless, spineless partisanship in 2012, British citizens would be preparing to choose the first elected members of the Lords in just seven months' time.

Why should anyone believe he is serious now? Labour promised democracy for the Lords again and again in their manifestos in 1997, 2001 and 2005. 

With big red Labour single-party majorities of 179, 167 and 66 – over thirteen long years – all they produced was bookshelves full of committee and commission reports. 

Miliband could list his manifold failings in the dust they all gathered.

The record is clear. The Lords gets bigger, staler and less legitimate with each passing day. 

Yet when it comes to the crunch, Labour leaders always choose their right to plonk pensionable donors and trade unionists into Parliament over the right of the people to choose their legislators. Miliband has already shown that for him, as for his predecessors, patronage trumps principle. Given half a chance, he will again.
