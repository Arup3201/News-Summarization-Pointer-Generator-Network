A world-famous university marching band has been thrown further into chaos after its long-serving director was last night fired after the death of a drum major in a suspected initiation ceremony.

Julian White, of Florida Agricultural and Mechanical University in Tallahassee, was unable to stop the alleged ‘hazing’ events in the band and music department, college president James Ammons said.

Robert Champion, 26, was found unresponsive on a bus parked outside a hotel in Orlando, Florida, on Saturday night after the school's football team lost to Daytona Beach rival Bethune-Cookman.

Mr Champion was vomiting and had complained he couldn't breathe before he collapsed. Mr White meanwhile has been placed on paid administrative leave and has 10 days to respond to his firing.

The incident happened following a popular football and marching band competition between two of the state's historically black universities at the Florida Classic in Orlando.

The school competes every year before a typically sold-out crowd and Mr Champion had been helping conduct the world-famous Florida A&M University's Marching '100' band.

But Mr Champion later said he not breathe in a band bus in the parking lot of a hotel after the game. He was taken to a hospital, where he was pronounced dead.

‘The investigation indicates that “hazing” was involved in the events that occurred prior to the 911 call for assistance,’ Orange County Sheriff Jerry Demings said earlier this week.

Mr Ammons said on Tuesday the school would indefinitely suspend all activities of the band.

He added that the school would also appoint a task force ‘to determine if there are any unauthorized and questionable activities associated with the culture of the Marching “100”.’

‘Our first priority at Florida A&M University is to protect the safety, health and well-being of our students, faculty and staff members,’ Mr Ammons said.

World-famous: The band was invited to perform at both of Bill Clinton's inaugural parades and in Paris in 1989 at France's Bastille Day Parade to celebrate the French Revolution's bicentennial

The Marching ‘100’ is renowned worldwide for its high-stepping, high-energy dance routines.

It was invited to perform at both of former U.S. president Bill Clinton's inaugural parades, and in Paris in 1989 at France's Bastille Day Parade to celebrate the French Revolution’s bicentennial.

Both the prestigious band and the university have faced hazing allegations in the past.

A former FAMU marching band member won a $1.8million verdict in 2001 in a civil battery suit against five members for a hazing incident in which he was beaten so badly his kidneys shut down.

The student also settled out of court with FAMU for an undisclosed sum. Then in 2005 Florida lawmakers bolstered penalties for hazing that resulted in great bodily injury or death.

A year later, five Kappa Alpha Psi fraternity members at FAMU were charged under the new law for a hazing incident that left the victim needing surgery after being caned more than 90 times.

Two of the fraternity members were convicted and sentenced to two-year prison terms.

In the latest case involving the drum major, officials said further tests will be needed after the medical examiner's autopsy of Champion was inconclusive as to the exact cause of death.

Mr Champion's father, who has the same name, told WSB-TV his son had been living his dream.

‘He did what he wanted to do and he reached the plateau that he wanted to be,’ he said. ‘I think he was in pretty good condition. He ate and he trained and had no medical condition that I know of.’

Orange County Sheriff's Captain Angelo Nieves said the sheriff's office was investigating both the death and hazing, and was conducting interviews at the FAMU campus in Tallahassee.

‘I'm very disappointed that we are at this point in the life of this university and we are here in 2011 dealing with an issue that should (have) long, long passed on our campus,’ Mr Ammons said.
