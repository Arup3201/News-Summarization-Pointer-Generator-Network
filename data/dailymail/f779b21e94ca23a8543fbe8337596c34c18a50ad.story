When applying for a job under a fake identity, it is important to make sure that, at the very least, you have a water-tight cover story.

So when dead terrorist 'Osama Bin Laden' answered an advert for a teaching post at an Indian primary school last year, citing Bill Clinton as his father, it did not take long for teachers to unravel his masquerade.

He was one of hundreds of bizarre false names given by chancers apparently hoping to secure jobs in schools in Uttar Pradesh, in northern India.

Perhaps the so-called 'Abcdefgh' thought he would stand a 
better chance of teaching children English when he told India's Ministry of 
Education that his father's name was Xyz.

Most candidates will not make it through to even the final stages of selection for primary school vacancies

Or maybe bow-wielding Hindu deity Jai Sri Ram thought he needed a break from heavenly duties to help boost the state's religious education results.

There was even one aspirant who gave his name as Farji, which translates as 'fake'. His father's name was given as Farji Singh.

And unsurprisingly, all these applicants had spotless academic records to boot, with 100 per cent marks in all exams.

When dead terrorist 'Osama bin Laden', left, applied for a teaching post at an Indian primary school last year, citing Bill Clinton, right, as his father, it did not take long for teachers to unravel his masquerade

But rather than dismiss the applications out of hand, the state's basic education department allotted them all registration numbers and and even issued letters for counselling on their 'fake' addresses.

Such aspirants, shortlisted in the first list of candidates for the primary teachers' job, have made the state's basic education department's recruitment drive a laughing stock.

The candidates have clearly fudged every detail, from name and address to  their exam records.

Incredibly, the screening of the applications, filled online, found over 60 per cent of candidates to be fake.

For 72,825 vacant posts of primary teachers, more than 70 lakh applications were received of which only about 20 are believed to be genuine.

Minister of state for basic education Waseem Ahmad said the department would sort out the errors.

'This system of receiving online applications and sorting it out by software was meant for observing complete transparency.

'Maybe there are some problems but they will be sorted out in coming days,' he was quoted as saying.

Interestingly, many of the candidates have claimed to have consistently
secured more than 95 per cent marks in all exams.

A
senior employee of the department said: 'The problem is that only fake 
candidates can be called for first and second counselling because their 
total marks are shown as between 95 per cent and 100 per cent.

'Obviously
such candidates will not turn up. But who will be answerable for the 
money and resources spent on shortlisting the applicants?

'It would have been better if the department had made it mandatory for the applicants to enclose all their educational certificates.'

However, Sanjay Sinha, secretary of the basic education board, said: 'We are still in the process of making a final merit list.

'The fake names would obviously be deleted during the final counselling of the aspirants. In that case, the next genuine candidate in the merit list will be given the opportunity.'

Since the vacancy for primary teachers was announced district- wise, lakhs of candidates from over 20 districts applied with the hope of being selected for the job.

The application was invited online and the cut off list of each district was supposed to vary according to the marks obtained by the applicants there.

But, the software couldn't detect and cancel many forms with fake details. Also, it could not discard more than one form filled by the same applicant.

As a result of it, the same applicants have been allotted many registrations numbers.
