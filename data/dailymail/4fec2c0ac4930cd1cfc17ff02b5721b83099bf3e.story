A Las Vegas police officer is being investigated by a federal grand jury after he kicked a man in diabetic shock five times in the head during a traffic stop, it was revealed today.

Henderson police sergeant Brett Seekatz was caught on dashboard camera beating Adam Greene after he was dragged from his car in the controversial 2010 incident.

In the video, Greene was stopped by officers who said they thought he was driving drunk. The diabetic was in fact suffering from severe hyperglycemia while on his way to work.

The man is shown to be unresponsive when an officer walks up to him, cursing, and kicks him in the head.

He is then kneed in the ribs by other officers as he screams out in pain.

Paramedics arrived on the scene and Greene was treated for low blood sugar. He was later treated for fractured ribs and bruises all over his body including his face and scalp.

In February, Greene was awarded a $292,500 settlement in the beating case.

Seekatz was 'disciplined' at the time, according to a Henderson police department statement, but was not suspended from duty or demoted.

However, it was revealed Tuesday that a grand jury has been hearing evidence for months about the incident.

Grand jury sessions are secret, and it is unknown what, if any, charges federal prosecutors are seeking against Seekatz, according to the Las Vegas Review-Journal.

The newspaper reported that the federal investigation was referenced in an email from Las Vegas Police Protective Association director Chris Collins to the union's nearly 3,000 members last week.

In the note, Collins outlined recent changes in the department's use-of-force hearings. He also advised officers not to testify if subpoenaed to appear, mentioning a federal investigation stemming from a 'high-profile arrest.'

'It has come to my attention that the local U.S. Attorney working with Department of Justice Civil Rights prosecutors, has been investigating another department's officer for alleged criminal conduct arising out of a high-profile arrest,' Collins wrote, according to the LVRJ.

The federal authorities regularly review officer-related use-of-force incidents for 'potential civil rights violations. The risk that you may be investigated by another law enforcement agency is real and substantial,' Collins wrote.

He told the Review Journal on Monday that he wasn't aware of the grand jury investigation and a spokesman for the U.S. Attorney's office said she could not confirm or deny it.

Greene's former lawyer said the man had not yet been subpoenaed to testify in any grand jury proceedings.
