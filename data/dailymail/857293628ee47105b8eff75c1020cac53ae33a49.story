In an unprecedented legal move, summonses have been issued against Thomas Monson over allegations the church's request that followers pay a 'tithe' - ten per cent of their income - could be in breach of the Fraud Act 2006

The head of the Mormon church has been summoned to appear before British magistrates over claims the organisation’s teachings amount to fraud.

In an unprecedented legal move, summonses have been issued against Thomas Monson over allegations the church’s request that followers pay a ‘tithe’ - ten per cent of their income - could be in breach of the Fraud Act 2006.

Mr Monson, president of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, based in Salt Lake City, Utah, was warned by Westminster Magistrates’ Court that failure to attend a hearing on March 14 ‘may result in a warrant for your arrest’.

The summonses - described by legal experts as among the most unusual documents ever issued by a British court - queries seven Mormon teachings.

They were issued after a private prosecution bid by London-based Tom Phillips, author of Mormonthink, a website highly critical of the church and its teachings.

Virtually identical documents were sent to Mr Monson naming former Mormon Bishop Stephen Bloor and former convert Christopher Denis Ralph as victims of the alleged fraud.

The summonses were brought under little-used legal procedures where people who say they have evidence that someone has committed a crime can ask a magistrate to issue a summons for them to attend court.

District Judge Elizabeth Roscoe, who signed the summonses, accuses Mr Monson of ‘dishonestly’ making a gain for himself or another’ by asking two men to pay tithes on the basis of ‘untrue or misleading’ representations.

Among Mormon teachings queried are that the Book of Mormon was translated from ancient gold plates, that native Americans are descended from an Israelite family which left Jerusalem in 600BC and that all humans are descended from two people who lived 6,000 years ago.

The Mormon Church - also known as the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints - dismissed the summonses as containing ‘bizarre allegations’.

Last night Mormon officials said that Mr Monson had no plans to attend the court case.

Mr Monson, president of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, based in Salt Lake City, Utah, was warned by Westminster Magistrates' Court that failure to attend a hearing on March 14 'may result in a warrant for your arrest'

The district judge would then decide whether or not to proceed with a case.

Palestinian activist used similar powers in 2009 to seek an arrest warrant issued against the Israeli justice minister, Tzipi Livni, leading to an international diplomatic incident. 

Mr Phillips said: ‘The head of the Mormon Church has been summoned to a court to answer allegations of fraud – I don’t think a judge at Westminster Magistrates’ Court would sign off on ‘bizarre allegations’ – I certainly hope they never would.

‘This has been a very serious matter that has been looked at in extreme detail.’

Malcolm Adcock, the Mormon church’s public affairs director for Europe, said: ‘The Church occasionally receives documents like this that seek to draw attention to an individual’s personal grievance or embarrass church leaders.

‘These bizarre allegations fit into that category.’

Phillips’ complaint is based on the Fraud Act of 2006, a British law that prohibits false representations made to secure a profit or to cause someone to lose money.

Conviction may carry a prison sentence of up to 10 years.

Sorry we are unable to accept comments for legal reasons.
