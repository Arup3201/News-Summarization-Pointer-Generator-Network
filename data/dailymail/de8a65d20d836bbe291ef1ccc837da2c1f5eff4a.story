From stiff backs to sore joints, there’s no doubt we are a nation in pain.

But exactly how much we suffer – and the effect it has on our lives – appears to vary dramatically depending on where we live.

New research unveiled today has revealed
that people living in Wales find pain the most distressing, while those
living in the West Country can tolerate it the most.

The survey, of 1,000 people around the 
UK suffering from chronic pain, gives an insight into how the condition 
blights millions of people’s lives.

The survey, of 1,000 people around the UK suffering from chronic pain, gives an insight into how the condition blights millions of lives. The different colours show pain thresholds apparently vary around the country

In Manchester, for example, 50 per cent of respondents said pain affected their mobility, while 61 per cent of Southampton residents said it made them feel depressed.

Joint pain is particularly common in Leeds, affecting 41 per cent of those questioned, while a third of people living in Norfolk suffer from backache.

In the nearby East Midlands, 59 per cent of people reported that back pain affects their ability to do daily chores.

Chronic pain is estimated to affect 10 million Britons.  The research, commissioned by Lloydspharmacy, also found that 77 per cent of those living with chronic pain have suffered for years, yet  many are not seeking professional support from GPs or pain clinics. 

The study also highlighted the huge impact pain has on people’s lives, with nearly half of those questioned admitting to feeling depressed as a result of their condition. Nearly 10 per cent said it had made them feel suicidal at some point. 

Almost half said they were not accessing regular support from their GP and over two thirds had never used a pain clinic or a support group for help.

Overall, regardless of area, almost two thirds said their pain affected their mobility and 55 per cent said it kept them awake at night.  

The same number said they struggled to carry out everyday tasks such as shopping and cleaning. 

Chronic pain has become an increasingly important area for the health sector. A Royal College of General Practitioners’ announcement in 2011 identified the treatment of pain as one of its four priorities for 2011-14 – with a view to improving education, training and the patient experience.

More recently Jeremy Hunt, in one of his first public addresses as Health Secretary, announced that people with long-term conditions were one of his four priorities for the NHS. 

Despite this, just under a fifth of respondents who had not sought support for their chronic pain cited ‘not wanting to bother healthcare professionals’ as the reason.

Meanwhile, more than half said they didn’t feel anything could be done, so it was ‘better to just put up with it’.   

Ian Semmons, chairman of the charity Action on Pain, said: ‘Many people tell me that chronic pain is dominating their life, affecting not only their social life and family time, but even their ability to hold down a job. 

‘I would actively encourage people to seek out help – you may feel that there is little hope but it shouldn’t have to be like that. By asking for support and advice you will be making a positive step towards improving your life.’

The research was commissioned to co-incide with the launch of a free, nationwide pain assessment service at Lloydspharmacy.

Nitin Makadia, pharmacist and pain expert at Lloydspharmacy, said: ‘Nearly one in seven of us suffer with chronic pain in the UK yet a worrying number of people clearly feel that they have nowhere to turn for support. 

‘We know that often there’s no cure for chronic pain but there are ways you can manage it better and with regular ongoing support you can make positive steps to improve your overall wellbeing.’
