'Nasty': NASCAR driver Kasey Kahne tweeted his apparent disgust at a woman's 'nasty' breastfeeding at a grocery store

After an online outcry, NASCAR driver Kasey Kahne apologised publically for his Twitter tirade about a woman’s ‘nasty' breastfeeding in the local supermarket.

The 31-year-old bachelor’s comments sparked uproar in the Twitterverse, eliciting an apology from Kahne via his Facebook page late Wednesday night.

He wrote: 'It was in no way my intention to offend any mother who chooses to breastfeed her child, or, for that matter, anyone who supports breast feeding children.'

'My comments were not directed at the mother’s right to breastfeed. They were just a reaction to the location of that choice, and the fashion in which it was executed on that occasion.'

His NASCAR sponsor Great Clips also released a statement, which read: 'Our apologies for this. Please know that response was uncalled for & does not reflect our organisation.'

Earlier this week, Kahne posted several tweets in rapid succession capturing his apparent disgust at a woman nursing her child in the produce section.

He said he first thought he was imagining things, but once he realised the mother was indeed nursing, he began tweeting his horror.

No offense meant: Kasey Kahne posted an apology on Facebook Wednesday after his Twitter rampage

‘Just walking through supermarket. See a mom breast feeding little kid,’ he tweeted. ‘Took second look because obviously I was seeing things I wasn’t!’

Upon second look, he described the woman’s breastfeeding in detail. ‘One boob put away one boob hanging!’ he tweeted, with the hashtag ‘#nasty ‘ following the post.

He was apparently so repulsed that he then wrote: 'I don’t feel like shopping or eating anymore'.

Later, a woman named Deana P. tweeted to him that she disagreed breastfeeding was 'nasty' and that he was 'kind of a douchebag'.

Tirade timeline: Earlier, Kahne posted several tweets about how grossed out he was to see a woman breastfeeding in public

‘I hope someday you have a kid and someone tells your wife that feeding your child looks nasty,' she wrote. 'Stay classy a**hole.'

Kahne, who currently stars in an Allstate ad campaign that centres around his appeal among women, responded by calling her a 'dumb b***h'.

He tweeted an apology to Deana P., saying his remarks were 'out of line'.

He wrote: '@KnittingRad I wanted to apologize for saying what I said to you yesterday. It was out of line.'

The woman, whose Twitter page indicates she's a mother of three from Minnesota, wrote an apology of her own, saying her comments to the racer were also 'knee-jerk and out of line'.

Kahne's very public qualms came amid 
another breast-feeding controversy, which resulted in hundreds of 
mothers in 35 states staging a nurse-in at their nearby Target stores 
after a Texas mother was told last month that she could not breastfeed 
in public.

Michelle Hickman, a mother of four, 
was trying to do some Christmas shopping last month when Target 
employees asked her to relocate to a more private location, such as a 
family fitting room.

Humiliated by the incident, Mrs Hickman used Facebook to organize the massive 'nurse-in'.

Kahne, who has 12 NASCAR wins to his credit, does a great deal of charity work through his Kasey Kahne foundation, which benefits chronically ill kids and their families.

In 2007, however, he found himself on the wrong side of the law.

In November of that year, Kahne was charged was 
charged with assault for pushing an elderly security guard at the 
Homestead-Miami Speedway in Florida.

The misdemeanour charges were later dropped after Kahne completed 50 hours of community service.

He
was also slapped with a civil suit by the security guard, who claimed 
he suffered a severe back injury as a result of the incident, but that 
suit was settled in 2009.

'Out of line': Kahne later apologised for his comments, which spawned a massive uproar on Twitter
