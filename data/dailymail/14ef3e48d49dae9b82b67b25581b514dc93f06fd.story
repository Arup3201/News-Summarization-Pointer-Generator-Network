Few racing games have generated as much excitement as Grid 2. So, MailOnline has teamed up with developers Codemasters to answer your questions. Fans grilled Iain Smith, producer for the game, set for release on May 28.

Does Codemasters still have the licences for BTCC, DTM and V8 Supercars? If so, what has stopped you from implementing these series into the GRID games, and if not how difficult and expensive would it be to obtain them once again?

Smith: 'We would license those properties on a game by game basis – there’s no reason why not further down the line, but right now our focus is on the GRID franchise and what that means for gamers – a comprehensive racing experience.

'That not only contains licensed touring and super-touring cars, but a vast array of other motorsports, race-modified road cars and supercars for players to get their hands on. By including this eclectic content we created our own series called the World Series Racing championship (WSR) to house them all in in a realistic way. It is all backed up by ESPN coverage to make the organisation live and breathe like a real entity.'

Why is there no Le Mans?

Smith: 'With each new game we want to bring a fresh set of content for players to try out, and maybe throw some iconic stuff from the heritage of the GRID and RaceDriver series in the mix too. Because Le Mans featured in GRID 1, we didn’t necessarily want that to be a first choice in GRID 2 before we locked down on plans for our newer content.

'The new content in GRID 2 includes circuits, street racing tracks and point to point road racing, so it meant the choices for traditional circuits were of poured over all the more clinically, before going for the places we chose in the end.

'We’ve got Brands Hatch, Indianapolis, Portimao Algarve, the Red Bull Ring and Yas Marina in the title, which give a really international feel to the game. But there’s nothing to say pulling the Le Mans track back into the game at some point down the line cannot happen.'

Can any car be picked for any type of race on any track?

Smith: 'Within the Custom Race area of the game that’s pretty much the case yes! Players can choose to drive open-wheel sportscars on point to point tracks if they so wish. You’ll also be able to define the route, the light condition and the rules of the event. However, the Career mode has a more realistic approach of placing appropriate vehicles into events and circuits you’d expect.

'Part of the thrust of what GRID 2 is all about, is that we’re finding the best driver in the world in World Series Racing –it’s mixed discipline, like a decathlon of motorsports. Each driver will try events outside their standard comfort zone.

'So for that reason, the events are set up as realistically as possible – open wheelers on traditional circuits and drift machines on city tracks or weaving point to points.'

I've only seen Liveries, Paint & Wheel Options - what about Body Mods, Engine & Suspension Upgrades and Customizations?

Smith: 'The online side of the game has vehicle upgrades which affect the performance of the car – it’s this side of the game that comes alive as you spend your earned currency on improving your car to compete against the competition.

'But you also have choice there – you can save that currency and ultimately buy a much more powerful vehicle a little down the line if you can hold enough.'

Will you be doing something to stop people 'driving dirty' online?

Smith: 'Griefing was something we were really conscious to tackle in the GRID 2 multiplayer – I think  online there are never going to be complete solutions, but we’ve made some serious steps forward to resolve some of the worst parts.

'A large number of known “bad” behaviours have been added to our list of things to penalise players for – reversing off the start line, intentionally blocking others, staying still on the track – those things that you really don’t want to experience to break up your fun as you race have all been tackled.

'In addition, the way we match-make players in their lobbies online takes this into account their general “Impact Rating” and the degree to which players are in contact with others and generally breaking the rules whilst racing.

'If you’re serious about playing GRID and racing fairly, then you should be getting match-made with like-minded players.'

Will there be splitscreen on PCs like in Dirt 3?

Smith: 'Yes, we’ve included splitscreen for all platforms – it’s always fun to play with your opponent sitting right next to you!'

Formula fun: As well as street-based events, there are races in stadiums using different breeds of car

Is there dynamic music and custom tracks?

Smith: 'The system works based on multiple stems reacting to the player’s actions – if you are ahead, behind or way out in front of competition, if you’re racing in a pack tightly or if you have more space on track.

'In some cases the music is slightly more rigid in order to work with a game mode – for example, checkpoint works with a ticking timer that players need to keep alive, so the timing of the beats in that in-game score needs to work well.

'I think it’s a really fantastic touch, and helps to make the action on-track feel theatrical. With that said, it doesn’t appear in every race, as sometimes it’s not appropriate and can detract. We’ve balanced it very particularly.'

What are the plans for DLC?

Smith: 'Information about our DLC plan will be coming around launch time next week. In the interim, details of our pre-order bonuses are available on the GRID website and facebook page – my particular favourite is the Indycar pack featuring two new routes for the Indianapolis Motor Speedway and the Dallara Indycar and Pacecar.'

Is there day/night time for each location?

Smith: 'We have day, night and dusk settings across most of the tracks and locations.'

Leaving a mark: GRID games encourage you to master the drift, but veering off course can be devastating

What is the number of difficulty settings?

Smith: 'Very Easy, Easy, Medium, Hard, and Very Hard!'

How did you come up with the LiveRoutes idea?

Smith: 'LiveRoutes was a bi-product of wanting to offer more variation in what players see and play in the game. We were inspired a little by open world titles, but actually wanted to retain the sense of a “race” and avoid creating something to explore just for the sake of variety.

'This was a great alternative – really pulling in all the different parts of the cities that we’ve build but linking them in such a variety of ways that players will hardly ever see the same corner combinations come up twice.'

What online features will there be?

Smith: 'Online is a wholly separate part of the game, single player and online are selected separately right at the press start screen, so you’ll head down a completely alternate path and progression system. It has its own currency model and car customisation and upgrades are a key aspect of that.

'In addition, we have a rivals system to take on players across the world and a Global Challenge mode which utilises the RaceNet system. RaceNet really comes into its own with GRID 2 – it works from web to game as well as game to web, which is a big step for us.'

Have the carmakers allowed random breakdowns and realistic damage or have your hands been tied to keep them happy?

Smith: 'We always tread a very careful line with approvals from manufacturers and ultimately have to take their advice, but we have pushed things to be as realistic as possible. The vehicles will react more realistically than most of our competitors out there.

'We have full damage models for each car, have tyre shredding and wheel damage and the AI will occasionally pull up with engine issues – exactly as you’d expect from real life motorsports.'
