A minute's silence will be held tonight in memory of a mother and her newborn baby who were found dead in Bristol, before a ceremony to celebrate 150 years of Clifton Suspension Bridge takes place.

There had been calls for the ceremony to be cancelled after the bodies of Charlotte Bevan and her newborn daughter Zaani Tiana were found in the city last week.

But organisers decided the celebration of the bridge, which was designed in 1829, will go ahead with a silence before hand to allow people to pay their respects to mother and daughter. 

A minute's silence will be held tonight in memory of Bristol mother Charlotte Bevan and her daughter who were found dead last week, before a ceremony to mark the 150th anniversary of Clifton Suspension Bridge begins

Police began an urgent search for Miss Bevan, 30, and her child after she was seen on CCTV walking through the hospital before she left the maternity ward at St Michael's Hospital on Tuesday. She was wearing slippers and her daughter was wrapped in a blanket as temperatures plunged to near freezing in some areas.

Miss Bevan's body was found in Avon Gorge the next day, close to Clifton Suspension Bridge. Zaani Tiana, who was just four days old, was found hours later on a cliff face. 

It has been claimed Miss Bevan, who was suffering from depression and schizophrenia, had stopped taking her medication so she could breastfeed her baby. 

She may also have been concerned that the authorities were going to take away her child as she had been closely monitored during her pregnancy.

Calls had been made to cancel celebrations, which start this evening, to mark the 150th anniversary of Clifton suspension bridge. After the minute's silence there will be a firework display launched from Isambard Kingdom Brunel's bridge. 

On Monday there will be a special procession to stage a re-enactment of the opening ceremony 150 years ago, finishing at the new Suspension Bridge Visitor Centre. 

A ceremony will be held to mark the 150th anniversary of Clifton suspension bridge, which is maintained by painters like Arthur Heal (left) and sees air balloons pass over it (right) for the annual Bristol balloon fiesta 

A statement, issued by the Clifton Suspension Bridge Trust, said: 'Having thought very deeply about this, it is felt that the planned event should go ahead. 

'The loss of Charlotte and Zaani, as well others who have previously died in the Avon Gorge, will be marked by a minute of quiet and reflection prior to the start of the firework display at 7pm.

'We will set up a collection with the proceeds going to a charity, which we hope to discuss with Charlotte's family at an appropriate time.'

The project to build Clifton Suspension Bridge began in 1754 when William Vick, a Bristol wine merchant, left £1,000 in his will to the Society of Merchant Venturers, a guild which managed the port at Bristol. 

Once this investment grew to £10,000 it was to be used to create a stone bridge connecting Bristol to north Somerset 

By 1829 around £8,000 had been raised and a competition was launched to find a designer for the bridge

However no winner was found and after a second round Isambard Kingdom Brunel, 23, was chosen to be project engineer. 

On June 21, 1831, a ceremony was held to commemorate the start of the works - which were not to be completed for almost 30 years.  

By 1843 only the towers of the bridge had been completed and the project was abandoned.

Brunel died in 1859, never able to see the finished work from his design.  

Colleagues of Brunel at the Institution of Civil Engineers decided the bridge would be a fitting memorial to the engineer and they started to fundraise for the project. 

Brunel's Hungerford suspension bridge was being demolished at the time and its chains were brought in to use at Clifton.  

Work was started again and the bridge was eventually completed in 1864. 

It spans 702ft and sits 245ft above the water. 

The bridge was originally designed to carry horse drawn carriages and pedestrians but has remained so strong it is now capable of carrying a million cars a year.

Who was Isambard Kingdom Brunel? 

Isambard Kingdom Brunel was a respected Victorian engineer who transformed public transport

Brunel was a mechanical and civil engineer whose work on bridges and tunnels across Britain helped the development of the railways gather pace. He also built dockyards and steamships, making a huge contribution to the development of public transport. 

Prior to leading the Clifton Suspension Bridge project, Brunel had  been appointed resident engineer on the Thames tunnel but almost died when the roof collapsed and the tunnel flooded in 1827. 

He later held a banquet there to restore people's confidence in the project.

In 1829 he won a competition to become project engineer of Clifton Suspension Bridge and work started two years later.  

Brunel began to be associated with Bristol docks in 1832, which he helped modernise. 

In 1833 he was appointed as chief engineer to Great Western Railway and began work to start modernising Bristol docks. 

Three years later work had restarted on the Thames tunnel and Brunel was appointed engineer at Great Western Steam Ship company. The SS Great Western, proposed by Brunel years earlier, sailed from Bristol to New York in 15 days in 1838. 

As part of his design for the Great Western Railway Brunel needed to organise digging a tunnel through solid stone in Bath. This became known as Box Tunnel and construction began in 1836 and was opened in 1841.  

He was also the engineer for Hungerford's suspension bridge and was appointed engineer of South Devon Railways. Brunel also designed the Royal Albert Bridge in 1855 for the Cornwall Railway.
