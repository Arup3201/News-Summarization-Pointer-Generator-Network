Hundreds of copies of Anne Frank's 'The Diary of a Young Girl' have been defaced at public libraries across Tokyo, it has been revealed.

At least 265 books have been vandalised at 31 municipal libraries in Japan's capital since the end of January.

Most have had dozens of pages ripped out of them - with others having specific extracts torn out.

Defaced: More than 250 copies of Anne Frank's 'The Diary of a Young Girl' have been vandalised at public libraries across Tokyo. Above, damaged copies of the diary and other related books at Shinjuku City Library

Shocking: Kotaro Fujimaki, director of Shinjuk City Library, displays a ripped picture book of Anne Frank's diary. He said copies of the book are now being stored behind the library's reception desk following the vandalism

Vandals have also targeted other books about the young Holocaust victim, who wrote her diary while she and her family hid from the Nazis in occupied Amsterdam during World War Two. 

Japanese police are investigating, but say the motive behind the widespread damage is unclear.

Today, Japan's chief cabinet secretary, Yoshihide Suga, called the vandalism 'shameful' - claiming that the country would not tolerate such acts.

Mitsujiro Ikeda, an official in Nakano, added: 'Books related to Miss Anne Frank are being clearly targeted, and it is happening across Tokyo. It is outrageous.'

Renowned: Anne Frank wrote her diary while she hid in Nazi-occupied Amsterdam during World War Two

Anger: Japanese police are investigating, but say the motive behind the widespread damage is currently unclear. Above, Mr Fujimaki explains his decision to remove Anne Frank-related books from library shelves

He added that vandals had reportedly damaged some of the books while inside reading rooms at Nakano district libraries, but had gone unnoticed.

Many libraries have now decided to move undamaged copies of Anne Frank's diary behind the counter for protection.

Kotaro Fujimaki, director of Shinjuk City Library, said he had taken the decision to store the book behind the library's reception desk after a number of copies were found ripped on its shelves. 

A happier time: The Frank family moved to Amsterdam from Germany in 1933, but were forced to go into hiding in 1942 after the Nazis occupied the country. Above, Anne with her childhood friend Hannah Goslar Pick (right)

Yesterday, a U.S. Jewish rights group spoke out against the vandalism - urging Japanese police to step up 
their efforts to find those responsible.

In a statement, the Simon Wiesenthal Center's associate Dean, Rabbi Abraham Cooper, said: 'The geographic 
scope of these incidents strongly suggest an organised effort to 
denigrate the memory of the most famous of the 1.5million Jewish 
children murdered by the Nazis in the Holocaust.

'I
 know from my many visits to Japan how much Anne Frank is studied and 
revered by millions of Japanese.

Crowded: In 1944, the Frank family was anonymously betrayed and Anne was sent to her death at Bergen-Belsen concentration camp, where she died of typhus in 1945. Above, women and children at the camp

Deadly: It is estimated that 50,000 inmates died in the notorious northwest German camp during the war. Above, female inmates use water to wash for the first time following their liberation by British troops in 1945

'Only people imbued with bigotry and 
hatred would seek to destroy Anne's historic words of courage, hope and 
love in the face of impending doom.'

He added: 'We are calling on Japanese authorities to step up efforts to identify and deal with the perpetrators of this hate campaign.'

Anne Frank wrote her diary over two years while she and her family hid in a concealed apartment in the Nazi-occupied Netherlands.

Posthumous fame: Anne Frank's diary is now part of the syllabus in schools in many countries, including Japan

The Frank family had moved to Amsterdam 
from Germany in 1933, but were forced to go into hiding in 1942 after 
the Nazis occupied the country.

In 1944, the family was anonymously betrayed and Anne was sent to her death at Bergen-Belsen concentration camp, where she died of typhus in 1945.

It is estimated that 50,000 inmates died in the notorious northwest German camp between 1941 and 1945.

Anne's father, Otto Frank, survived the war and later published his daughter's diary, which has since become the most widely read document to emerge from the Holocaust.

The book is now part of the syllabus in schools across many countries, including Japan.
