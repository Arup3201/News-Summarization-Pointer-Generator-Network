Music streaming service Spotify will overtake Apple's iTunes store within two years if it keeps growing at its current rate, claims Sean Parker, Facebook's first president.

The technology billionaire, famous from the film 'The Social Network', where he was played by Justin Timberlake, claims that music companies will earn more from Spotify than from Apple within two years.

He also poked fun at the slow speeds of 
Apple's download store, saying, 'The iTunes store, to this day, is so 
slow. I’m amazed.'

Parker has invested $15 million of his estimated $2 billion in the music-streaming company, which is already the number two music service in Europe after iTunes.

'If Spotify continues growing at its current rate in terms of subscribers and users, we will overtake iTunes in terms of the amount of revenue we contribute to the music labels in under two years,' says Parker.

He was speaking at the SXSW conference in Austin, Texas, this week.

Spotify's songs are available as streams to subscribers, and can also be downloaded to apps on iPhone, Android and PC.

Spotify 
recently hit 10 million users worldwide after a partnership with 
Facebook which allowed web users to access Spotify via their Facebook 
log-in.

Spotify now has 10 million signed-up users and 2.5 million paying subscribers. CEO Daniel Ek points out that subcribers pay £120 a year, whereas customers of iTunes store only pay £60 on average

The site now has 3 
million paying subscribers, paying around £10 per month to access the 
streaming service via phones and desktops.

Artists such as Paul McCartney have refused to offer their music via the site, claiming it offers artists a bad deal.
