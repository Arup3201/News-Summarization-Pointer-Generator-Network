Controversial wannabe model 
Josie Cunningham - who claimed she would abort her unborn baby so she could take part in a TV programme - has come under fire for accusing Peaches Geldof of being a bad mother.

The
 heavily-pregnant single mother, who first shot to notoriety last year when she had a £4,800 NHS-funded breast enlargement, has posted a string of tweets labelling the sympathy for the late Miss Geldof 'pathetic.'

In a flurry of tweets, Ms Cunningham said: 'Really irritates me that the same trolls sending me s**t since the abortion story are STILL defending peaches!! (sic)'

Her comments have sparked a furious 
reaction from fellow Twitter users, who say that Ms Cunningham - who does not know who the father of her child is - is in no position to judge her parenting skills.

Controversial wannabe glamour model Josie Cunningham has taken to Twitter to accuse the late Peaches Geldof being a bad mother

In a flurry of tweets, Ms Cunningham said: 'Really irritates me that the same trolls sending me s**t since the abortion story are STILL defending peaches!! (sic)'

Then, in reference to an incident in which the young mother was pictured as her baby toppled out of its pram while she was on the phone, she posted: 'Her baby fell out the pram when she was to busy on her phone and now it's reported her... baby was left on its own with her dead body for 17 hours'

Finally she added: 'an addiction to drugs is the result of a s**t choice you made whilst being a parent, feeling sorry for her "addiction" is pathetic!'

Charlotte ‏@GreenEyedBarby Tweeted: '@JosieCOnline no matter what anyone else does it's still not as bad as you wanting to abort your baby, sell a pregnancy video to £land'

 Sarah‏@BeesBabe1975 added: '@JosieCOnline At least she wanted her kids and didn't threaten to abort them for fame! You're a great role model'

Miss Nemu_vQ ‏@TippleFishNEMO also tweeted: '@JosieCOnline Who are you to talk about a child's safety, you wanted to f*****g abort your unborn child, you utter cretin.'

An inquest heard that Miss Geldof died of a drugs overdose ten times bigger than the one that killed her mother Paula Yates.

Stashes of heroin, burned spoons and almost 80 syringes were scattered around the 25-year-old’s country home.

Her husband returned from a weekend 
away to find her slumped dead on a bed. She had been looking after their
 baby son Phaedra, who was left alone for up to 17 hours.

Ms Cunningham 
shot to notoriety last year when she had a £4,800 NHS-funded operation 
to increase her bust from size 32A to 36DD, claiming she had been 
bullied since she was 14 for having a flat chest.

She
 has since gone on to make a name for herself over the past 12 months by
 selling a number of stories, including how she received Botox on the 
NHS for her sweat problem and debated aborting her unborn baby for the 
chance to appear on Big Brother.

Talk
 of her latest money-spinner - a possible DVD of her child’s birth - was
 announced in May, when she said: ‘By selling DVDs of the birth, people 
will get to see my maternal side. I love One Born Every Minute - it'll 
be just like that.’

However, it has since been reported that the poundshop chain lined up to sell the video has backed out of the deal.

After
 receiving backlash when seemingly confirming the deal was over, she 
responded by posting: ‘People may laugh, but think about it! 
500 stores x 500 copies each equals a s**t loads of £’s! (sic)’

‘Sadly I can only refer to it as a pound store, if it’s any help.... we can rule out the 99p store.’ 

Glamour model Ms Cunningham, who posted this scan of her baby on her Twitter feed, was apparently in talks to film a DVD of the child's birth and sell it in pound stores across the UK

The wannabe glamour model has previously caused outrage by posting controversial tweets, including this one

Ms
 Cunningham has previously admitted to not knowing who the father of her
 unborn child is, claiming she fell pregnant while working as a 
£1,000-a-night escort.

She has also admitted to considering having her unborn baby aborted so she could appear on Channel 5’s Big Brother.

She
 said she had been on the shortlist to appear on the reality television 
show - but was reluctant to proceed because of her pregnancy.

It was while working as an escort that Ms Cunningham had the breast augmentation which first made her infamous.

The
 operation was funded by the same NHS trust which refused to fund 
surgery that would have enabled a two-year-old girl with a form of 
cerebral palsy to walk.

After
 the enlargement, Ms Cunningham claimed her breasts were ‘so big’ she 
found them embarrassing, and enraged the nation further by claiming the 
NHS should pay for a reduction.

She then tried to placate 
public opinion by promising to pay back the cash but admitted she could 
not uphold her pledge when she fell pregnant.  

She
 now continues to soak up public funds and even receives state-funded 
transport to take her children to school because of the 'negative 
attention' she receives on public transport.

It
 means that since May, she and her children have been driven in taxis 
the two-and-a-half miles to and from the local school, twice a day. The 
journey would cost around £30 a week by bus.
