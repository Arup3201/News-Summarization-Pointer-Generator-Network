Airbnb has defended its controversial new logo, claiming it will become as recognisable as the Nike swoosh.

'It’s just like: Go ahead, laugh all you want, guys,' said Airbnb co-founder and CTO Nathan Blecharczyk at a dinner in San Francisco.

'We wouldn’t want to design a logo that caters to the lowest common denominator.'

Whoops! People across the Internet are saying that Airbnb's new logo looks obscene

Online users pointed out the logo is almost identical to tech firm Automation Anywhere's.

The two firms told VentureBeat 'In early 2014 both Airbnb and Automation Anywhere began use of new logos that, by coincidence, have similar designs.

'Airbnb and Automation Anywhere are working cooperatively to address this issue, and Automation Anywhere is in the process of transitioning to a new logo design that is not similar to the Airbnb logo.'

The new logo, created by U.K. design firm The Design Studio, drew comparisons to various body parts now only because it didn’t have the Airbnb brand attached to it yet, Blecharczyk told a reporter from tech website re/code.

'If you looked at the Nike swoosh, you might say it’s a check mark, but once you understand the context, it means something else,' he said.

'The symbol is not supposed to be a symbol, it’s supposed to be something with meaning.'

The firm has even given a the logo its own name, calling it a bélo - causing more amusement on social media sites.

'The bélo is a vehicle for rich, deep, emotional, human stories,' the firm sad.

Airbnb's CEO Brian Chesky said the logo was inspired by famous logos from around the world, like the Olympic rings and Batman symbol.

'We’ve created a symbol for us as a community,' he said in a blog post announcing the change.

'It’s an iconic mark for our windows, our doors, and our shared values.

The firm has also launched an online tool allowing users to create their own version of the logo, which it says can then be printed on mugs and t-shirts

'It’s a symbol that, like us, can belong wherever it happens to be.'

DesignStudio, the London-based team of graphic designers behind it, says on its website that the goal was to 'design a marque anyone could draw - something that transcended language and formed the foundation of a new brand.'

Airbnb's co-founder Brian Chesky said the new logo represents:

'A symbol for people who want to try a new tea they’ve never heard of from a village they couldn’t find on the map.

'It’s a symbol for going where the locals go—the cafe that doesn’t bother with a menu, the dance club hidden down a long alleyway, the art galleries that don’t show up in the guidebooks.

'It’s a symbol for people who want to welcome into their home new experiences, new cultures, and new conversations.'

Twitter user shaunpendy designed an infographic providing one possible explanation for how the logo came to be. In addition to people, places, and love, he said the final component was 'truck nuts.'

User mbraaten hypothesized what the meeting to decide on the symbol might've been like. In her scenario, one person says they're all out of ideas, and another person responds, 'Balls!'

Finally, aaronpcalvin wonders 'what if the new Airbnb logo is neither a penis or a vagina' as he smokes on a pipe, like Sherlock Holmes.

The
 logo took nearly a year of research to complete, 
and designers traveled to more than a dozen countries to interview Airbnb hosts and guests.

They also performed in-depth analyses of 
competing brands, from Facebook to IBM. 

Eventually,
 their mood boards and research piled up so high that Chesky said it 
looked like 'Russell Crowe's workshop in A Beautiful Mind.'

As part of the reveal, the company launched 'Create Airbnb,' a place on their site where users can make their own symbols that will be on their profiles. 

'Behind each symbol is a story only you can tell, about your home, your guests and your adventures,' the site reads.

Once you've created your symbol, you can put it on 'mugs, thank you cards, and souvenir stickers.'

The logo's launch was part of an overall site reboot, designed to make the it cleaner and splashier.

It all comes at an interesting time for the company, as they face legal troubles in big cities across the world for allegedly disobeying short-term housing laws.
