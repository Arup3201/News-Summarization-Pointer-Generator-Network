These incredible patterned pictures of a salt plain valley look like they could be a giant garden patio.

The bizarre arrangement of salt flats in Badwater Basin, California, covers a vast expanse of 200 square miles.

Vehicles are prohibited from the area so not to spoil the delicate arrangement of crystals and plants and animals struggle to survive.

With no rain for weeks, computer software worker Rob Etzel ventured out to the remote basin to see the patterned basin.

The
 enclosed basin is 282ft below sea level and doesn't drain away so 
leaves behind the salt crystals when water evaporates - leaving cracks 
in the dry surface.

Mr Etzel, 45, spent several hours hiking his way to Badwater Basin to capture these amazing photographs.

He said: 'The hexagon-shaped cracks are formed because of thermodynamics - the heat and the environment is harsh.

'Rare rain events can flood the valley and there are underground springs that can occasionally bring up surface water.

'But when I arrived, there had not been rain for many weeks, nor any significant rain for many months.'

Mr Etzel, from Portland in Oregon, described the formation as a 'multi-sided puzzle' or a chessboard.

He added: 'I travelled to Death Valley, among many other south west US locations, in search of photographic opportunities.

'To the average person driving through Death Valley, one might never see or encounter the unique shapes and patterns.

'You have to hike quite a way into the basins to find them and once I located them I spent several hours capturing photos.

'I think of the layout as a multi-sided puzzle or a chessboard.'
