A leading surgeon befriended a wealthy and vulnerable widow before bleeding her of her £1m fortune, a hearing was told.

Gabriella Adler-Jensen, 64, became an easy target for Dr Ashraf Kamal Elnazir after her elderly husband, Harry, died leaving her a £1.4m estate.

Under the influence of the married father-of-three she ‘invested’ hundreds of thousands of pounds into a bank account to fund business deals.

Large sums of money were then allegedly transferred to other bank accounts across the world and the money gradually disappeared.

A medical tribunal was told Mrs Adler-Jensen also treated Dr Elnazir, 54, to a lavish holiday to Dubai and also paid out for his sons’ private education.

On his suggestion she also bought the flat where he and his family lived in an exclusive block in West Kensington, London for £429,000, although the property had only been valued at £375,000.

Last night the surgeon, a leading colonic specialist who worked at London’s Chelsea and Westminster Hospital, was asked to answer the claims.

If they are found to be proved the doctor, who qualified in Khartoum, Sudan in 1985, could be struck off the medical register.

At a hearing of the Medical Practitioners Tribunal Service (MPTS) the panel was told friendship blossomed between the widow and the surgeon after the death of her husband in 2001.

They were living in the same smart block of flats, in Kensington, West London and grief-stricken by the loss of her 84-year-old husband she put her ‘trust' in Dr Elnazir and turned to him for guidance.

But between 2002 and 2006 the married surgeon is said to have ‘manipulated’ Mrs Adler-Jensen into investing in dubious business and property ventures.

In 2002 he allegedly suggested she buy the flat where he and his family lived but failed to transfer the whole property title to Mrs Adler-Jensen and instead retained joint legal and beneficial ownership of it.

The following April, the surgeon formed a limited company with the widow and opened a joint HSBC account for the purpose of business investments.

Between September 2003 and February 2006, she transferred around £779,000 into the joint account, but the doctor withdrew approximately £82,000 for his personal use.

Ed Morgan, representing the General Medical Council (GMC), claimed there was no evidence that any business investments had taken place.

The hearing was told in June 2004, the doctor and Mrs Adler-Jensen opened a joint HSBC US dollar account for the purpose of currency trading.

Mrs Adler Jensen deposited £645,000 into the account and the doctor is said to have then organised three transfers: one in December 2004 for $20,000 (£12,500) to an account in Egypt, one for $30,000 (£19,000) to an account in Beirut and another for $440,000 (£277,000) purportedly for the purchase of a plot of land in Egypt when no such transaction was intended.

The hearing was told all the money that went through two joint accounts belonged to Mrs Adler-Jensen with the surgeon misappropriating almost £820,000.

Mr Morgan said: ‘All the financial capital came from Mrs A throughout the relevant period as his only income came from his hospital salary.

‘By 2005, her financial resources had been depleted while in complete contrast the doctor’s fortunes had increased.’ The hearing was told that the surgeon, who represented himself at the hearing, believed some of the money had been ‘a gift’ from Mrs Adler-Jensen to his children while he also claimed he had been owed commission on the sale of the widow’s former flat.

The hearing continues. 

Sorry we are unable to accept comments for legal reasons.
