Crisis: 140 out of 323 councils said they have had to invest public money in food banks for the poverty-stricken

More than a third of  councils are subsidising food banks at a cost of £3million to the taxpayer.

An investigation has found that dozens of local authorities have put aside public cash to combat what they claim is a rising tide  of food poverty.

But some critics will question whether councils are using food banks as a political stick to beat the Coalition over its welfare reforms.

BBC Panorama asked all 375 councils in England and Wales about food banks and 323 responded. Of those, 140 said they had provided funding over the past two years.

While most councils paid for support such as management and administration, some were even paying for the food.

The programme found that two councils covering the Chingford and Woodford Green constituency of the Work and Pensions Secretary, Iain Duncan Smith, have between them committed almost £70,000 to food banks.

The Coalition has recently come under fire from Anglican bishops over its welfare reforms, in an open letter describing food poverty as a national crisis.

Vincent Nichols, the Archbishop of Westminster, who joined the attacks on behalf of the Catholic Church, said yesterday that people up and down the country were living in destitution.

In a country as wealthy as Britain, this was a disgrace, he added.

He said it was sometimes suggested that produce from food banks was sold on, but ‘I listen to my priests and they have said that when they put, from the food bank, three days’ food in front of a woman with her children, and she bursts into tears because she hasn’t eaten for three days – that’s not a fantasy, that’s human lives’.

The Bishop of Manchester, David Walker, told Panorama: ‘We need government to be explicit whether food banks are to be part of the system and, if they are, how do we make them work effectively. If they are not part of the system, we need a clear signal from government about that.’

Ministers say food banks increase demand by offering free produce, and insist there is ‘no robust evidence that welfare reforms are linked to increased use of food banks’.

Anglican bishops have blasted the Coalition for its welfare reforms which they claim have led to this crisis

The Department for Work and Pensions told Panorama: ‘Food banks do not form part of the benefit system.

‘Local authorities are now responsible for providing short-term, emergency help to those who need it and additional funding has been devolved to help them do so. Local authorities are better placed to give local support than a central system.’

In Derbyshire, the county council says its most pressing public health concern used to be healthy eating, but this had been overtaken by food poverty. The council has just invested £126,000 from its public health budget into food banks.

Counties like Derbyshire have had to forego healthy eating programmes to help support those without food

‘Some people in the country are not able to eat at all and if people can’t eat at all, what’s the point in trying to get them to eat healthily?’ said Julie Hirst, public health specialist at the council.

Professor Liz Dowler, a food policy expert at the University of Warwick who helped produce a government-commissioned report about food aid, said: ‘Food banks are an inadequate plaster over a gaping wound.

‘They do not solve the problems. And that they should be enshrined as an inadequate solution is  deeply immoral.’

Last night the Policy Exchange think-tank claimed 68,000 people had their welfare payments stopped unfairly each year, heightening demand for food banks.

Dr David Webster, a research fellow at the University of Glasgow, said there was ‘an undeniable link’ between the tougher benefits regime and the increased use of food banks.
