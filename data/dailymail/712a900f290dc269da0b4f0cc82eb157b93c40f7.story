Not long ago you would walk into your local McDonald’s, buy a hamburger and then eat it there or leave. But there’s a bit more to it than that now.

The fast food giant is launching McTV - high definition television in its restaurants, featuring local news, sport and entertainment features.

‘Survivor’ and ‘The Apprentice’ producer Mark Burnett is joining with BBC America and KABC-TV to provide content for 800 California restaurants.

New idea: Customer Steven Price sits at a table near a HDTV screen showing the new McDonald's channel in Norwalk, California, on Monday

‘While they're in line getting their hamburger there is no escape,’ Landor Associates brand expert Allen Adamson told the Los Angeles Times.

‘The podiums where companies can tell their stories have eroded - after the Super Bowl the list gets very short very fast.’

The in-store channel will be launched across restaurants in California by Los Angeles entertainment and technology firm ChannelPort.

Restaurants will be fitted with two high-definition screens of up to 46 inches that can be seen from 70 per cent of areas where food is eaten.

The fast food chain once seemed to want to get its customers in and out as quickly as possible - but now it's inviting them to stay and relax.

Harsh red and yellow tones are being replaced by muted colours. Sticky fibreglass tables are being replaced by wooden ones and harsh fluorescent lighting is going.

Students are encouraged to study using wi-fi facilites and families can enjoy sitting in open booths.

The clown-style red roof on some restaurants is being ditched for a subtle orange version and the iconic golden arches have been transformed into a 'semi-swoosh'.

Audio will be broadcast from the screen or ceiling speakers - but customers not wanting to listen or watch can sit in ‘quiet zones’ instead.

Programmes will be shown on a one-hour cycle and eight minutes of the hour will be for adverts - of which 90 seconds will be used by McDonald’s.

Mr Burnett, who also produced ‘Survivor’, is also involved with the channel, which is being launched over the next few months.

‘We believe there are so many screens in America that people are able to watch on and aggregate,’ he told the Los Angeles Times. ‘And it's more than sitting at home watching TV.

'Our company can do digital content on a national scale but with a local focus.’

McDonald’s is hoping to reach up to 20 million people every month – and there are plans to expand it nationwide if all goes to plan.

ChannelPort founder Leland Edmondson said they want to ‘catch and engage the customer’ and make viewers ‘active and participatory’.

Businesses from petrol stations and grocery stores to Starbucks are beaming more entertainment directly to customers, trying to address a captive audience in a world crawling with options.

‘People today are using our restaurants differently than they have in the past,’ a McDonald's spokesman told the Los Angeles Times.
