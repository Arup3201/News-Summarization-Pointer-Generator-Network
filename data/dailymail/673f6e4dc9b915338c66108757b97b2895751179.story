Recently released transcripts of jailhouse phone calls between murder suspect Curtis Reeves and his family reveal the retired Florida police captain is confident of his acquittal.

Other evidence released by the Pinellas-Pasco attorneys office, including photographs taken from inside the Wesley Chapel movie theater where Reeves shot dead Chad Oulson, 43, and injured his wife Nicole Oulson over a text messaging dispute, sheds light on the case.

Reeves, 71, faces charges of second-degree murder and aggravated battery in the January 13 shooting and is being held without bail.

Refused bail: Reeves, seen here at a February 5 bond hearing, was ordered to remain in prison until his trial

He is accused of gunning down husband and father Oulson and injuring his wife after the two men became involved in an argument over Oulson text messaging on his cell phone during previews for Lone Survivor at Grove Cobb 16 theater.

'When all the facts come out, we all should be in good shape,' Reeves told his family on January 16 - three days after the shooting, reports the Tampa Bay Times.

In the recordings released by the Pasco-Pinellas State Attorney's Office, he tells his wife Vivian and his son and daughter to sell his motorbike or kayak if they are in need of money.

'You all need to know that you're all the love of my life. And if it need be, y'all plan on me not being there so you plan whatever you have to do to make your life easy, okay,' he said.Â  'My life will be easy if your all's is. Plan the future and don't spend all the money on me.'

'We have all of that under control. We're not even going to talk about it,' daughter Jennifer Shaw tells him.

Photographs from the movie theater after the shooting show Curtis Reeves in handcuffs sitting in a theater seat, scattered popcorn, a dropped cell phone and a spent casing from the bullet that killed father-of-one Oulson.

They also show Nicole Oulson's badly injured hand after she was shot trying to deflect the bullet that killed her husband.

Video from the scene appears to show Oulson snatching Reeves' popcorn off his lap and throwing it at him. Reeves responds instantaneously with a single, fatal gunshot.

Reeves is claiming he shot the unarmed Oulson in self-defense because he feared for his life.

He told police that Oulson attacked him and that he feared for his life.

'Like I told everybody, I've spent 71 years doing the right thing and this guy just... anyway,' he said to his family over the phone.

However, in an interview with police after the shooting, Vivian Reeves gave a conflicting story.

A detective asked her, 'Did you see him get hit in the face?'

'No, I didn't,' responded Vivian Reeves.

A statement given by Reeves in the aftermath of the shooting has also been released.

'Suddenly, he jumps up and he turns around and he stands in his seat,' Reeves is said to have told investigators.

'He kept on hollering and I'm not sure what he said to be honest with you. He said something that led me to believe he was going to kick my ass, and I don't know if that's exactly how he phrased it or not,' reports ABC Action News.

Reeves's next hearing is set for July 9.
