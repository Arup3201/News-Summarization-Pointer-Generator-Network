England's campaign at the European Under 21 Championship looks set to be dominated over whether Harry Kane is included - but Gareth Southgate may not need him.

In front of over 30,000 at the Riverside Stadium, England came from behind to defeat Germany 3-2 and record a victory against not just old rivals but the pre-tournament favourites in the Czech Republic this summer.

Southgate is still expected to do everything he can to include the Tottenham striker, but the win over Germany shows that the Young Lions can go toe-to-toe with the cream of Europe.

Here Sportsmail looks at England's three stand-out stars from the win in Middlesbrough.

James Ward-Prowse

The Southampton star has already become an established member of the first team at St Mary's and is set to be a key member of Southgate's side in the Czech Republic.

The 20-year-old scored the winner with a crisp low effort after ghosting into the penalty box to find space. But his attacking play extends to set-pieces.

In Ward-Prowse, England have potentially their best dead-ball specialist since David Beckham with his passing range and accurate shooting already a highlight of his game.

Ward-Prowse was captain for the Germany victory and his rapid progress on the south coast in the last two years suggests he is worth keeping an eye on.

Carl Jenkinson

Named the official Man of the Match, Jenkinson put in a close to perfect performance - albeit he was slightly at fault for Germany's opening goal after allowing the cross for Philipp Hofmann to fire home.

But after a slow start to each half, the West Ham full-back, on loan from Arsenal, imposed himself down the right-hand side.

It was the 23-year-old's cross for Jesse Lingard which helped draw the Three Lions level in the first half, while he also provided the pass for Ward-Prowse to tuck home the winning goal.

With England's senior team lacking depth in the right-back area, Roy Hodgson could do worse than pick Jenkinson. Because if he doesn't, then Finland will as he can still play for the Scandinavian team.

Nathan Redmond

Relished the battle with Germany full-back Christian Gunter, often managing to pull away from his marker to lead an attack down the right wing.

Redmond is not all about pace though as he often tried to cut inside to mix up his approach, with his passing in the final third managing to catch the German back four flat on a number of occasions.

It was a much improved version of the winger who struggled in a poor Norwich side in the Premier League last season, but having struck the equaliser against a talented Germany team he looks to be improving.

Now a veteran of the Under 21 set-up, it will be difficult for Southgate to leave him out of the side in the summer to help make space for Kane as he has often impressed on the right wing for the Young Lions.
