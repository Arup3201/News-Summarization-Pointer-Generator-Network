Ched Evans is currently searching for a new club after serving half his five-year sentence for rape.

He would be by no means the first player to be imprisoned and make a return to the pitch. We chart some of the other convicted footballers who have continued with their careers.

Joey Barton

In May 2008, Barton, then playing for Newcastle United, was sentenced to six months in prison after being found guilty of common assault and affray during a violent attack in Liverpool city centre just after Christmas 2007. He served 74 days of this prison term - less than half - and walked free from Strangeways prison in Manchester on July 28. On July 1, 2008, Barton was handed a four-month sentence suspended for two years after admitting a charge of assault occasioning actual bodily harm on former Manchester City team-mate Ousmane Dabo in May 2007. The incident had ended his Sky Blues career. When Barton left jail in July 2008, he went straight back to Newcastle and returned to Premier League action the following month. He remained with the Tyneside club until 2011 before joining Queens Park Rangers, where he still plays. He spent a season on loan at French club Marseille in 2012-13.

Tony Adams

In December 1990, Adams was imprisoned for four months after being caught drink-driving. He was four times over the legal limit when he crashed his Ford Sierra into a wall in Rayleigh, Essex. Adams was freed in February, having served half his sentence and returned to the Arsenal team. The defender did overcome his alcohol addiction a few years later and founded the Sporting Chance clinic to help sports men and women suffering from addiction to drink, drugs and gambling. On the pitch, Adams was highly successful, leading Arsenal to Premier League and FA Cup Doubles in 1998 and 2002.

Lee Hughes

Striker Hughes was playing for West Bromwich Albion when he was sentenced in August 2004 to six years in prison for causing death by dangerous driving. Hughes lost control of his Mercedes near his Warwickshire home and went on to the wrong side of the road before colliding with a Renault Scenic. One passenger in the Renault was killed and two others severely injured. Hughes was released in August 2007, three years into his sentence. He was immediately sacked by West Brom after his conviction but signed a two-year contract with Oldham Athletic after his release. Hughes tried to draw a line under the affair, saying: ‘After today I do not intend to discuss or make comment about the events which led to my imprisonment. I have made this decision, not out of protection for myself, but with regard to the privacy and respect for the families involved. I made dreadful mistakes and decisions that will live with me for the rest of my life. It also greatly affected my immediate family, including my wife and children, and I will never forgive myself for this.’ He scored 25 goals in two seasons for them before later playing for Notts County, Port Vale and, presently, Forest Green Rovers.

Luke McCormick

Goalkeeper McCormick had his contract terminated by Plymouth Argyle after a car crash in June 2008 that killed two children. McCormick was driving back from the wedding of former team-mate David Norris when his Range Rover collided with a Toyota Previa on the M6 in Staffordshire. He was charged by police with two counts of causing death by dangerous driving, driving with excess alcohol in his blood and driving with no insurance and was sentenced to seven years and four months’ imprisonment in October that year. McCormick was released in June 2012 and later that year signed for Conference South team Truro City. He moved on to Oxford United in 2013 and is now back in goal for Plymouth.

Duncan Ferguson

Ferguson received a three-month prison sentence for his on-field headbutt on Raith Rovers defender John McStay while playing for Rangers in 1994. The Scotland international became the first footballer to be jailed for assaulting a fellow professional on the pitch. Ferguson moved to Everton after serving his time and played there until 1998, becoming a hero with the fans for his uncompromising approach. He spent a season at Newcastle before returning to Everton until his retirement in 2006.

Gary Croft

Croft made an unwanted piece of football history in January 2000 when he became the first player to wear an electronic tag during a game between Ipswich Town and Swindon Town. Croft had just been released from prison after serving just a month of a four-month contract for driving while disqualified and perverting the course of justice. Croft had to wear the tag, clearly visible around his left ankle, for three weeks and couldn’t play evening matches because of a curfew that demanded he be home by 7pm. Croft continued to play for Ipswich despite his prison term and later turned out for Cardiff City, Grimsby Town and Lincoln City.

Marlon King

King has sustained a football career at a fairly high level despite a string of convictions. In May 2002, when at Gillingham, he received an 18-month prison sentence for receiving stolen goods after being caught at the wheel of a stolen BMW convertible worth £32,000. Gillingham continued to pay his salary while behind bars and after he was released on licence after five months, he returned to the Gillingham team within two days. In 2009, King was sentenced to 18 months in prison for sexual assault and assault occasioning actual bodily harm after punching a 20-year-old girl in the face during a night out in Soho. Wigan Athletic cancelled his contract but he returned to football with Coventry City in September 2010 following his release. He moved on to play for Birmingham City and, briefly, for Sheffield United before being sent to prison again in May last year. King received an 18-month sentence for dangerous driving after leaving a man seriously injured following a car crash in April 2013.

Jan Molby

Liverpool star Molby was sentenced to three months inside for dangerous driving in October 1988. He was briefly at Walton Prison in Liverpool before being moved to Kirkham Open Prison. Despite Molby’s concerns, Liverpool stood by him and he returned to the team in January 1989, a month or so after his release. He remained at Anfield for another eight years.

Jermaine Pennant

In March 2005, while on loan at Birmingham from Arsenal, Pennant was handed a three-month prison sentence for drink-driving and driving while disqualified. Pennant, then 22, had crashed his car into a lamppost in Aylesbury, Buckinghamshire. He was released on parole after 30 days and was ordered to wear an electronic tag at all times, including in matches for Birmingham. He remained with the club for another year before signing for Liverpool in a £6.7m deal.

Mickey Thomas

Thomas was playing for Wrexham towards the end of his career in 1993 when he served 18 months in jail for a counterfeit currency scam. He was passing faked £10 and £20 notes to the club’s trainees. Thomas, who also spent time at Chelsea and Manchester United during his career, later said he felt the sentence was unjust. ‘The judge made an example of me. He was enjoying it: a full house, with all the media there. If I’d been anyone else, I probably wouldn’t have gone to jail.’ Still, his time inside resulted in plenty of anecdotes for his after dinner speaking tours, one favourite being: ‘So Roy Keane’s on 50-grand a week. Mind you, I was on 50-grand a week until the police found my printing machine.’ Thomas didn’t return to Wrexham after his release and ended his career at Welsh side Porthmadog.
