A man has been sentenced to 25 years in prison after pleading guilty to murder and conspiracy in the deaths of six people, including a prostitute who featured on an HBO reality show.

Johnathan Allen Cochran's sentence came down after he pleaded guilty in late February as part of a plea deal in which he will testify against others charged in the case, The Oklahoman reported, citing court documents.

One of the victims in the November 9, 2009 attack was Brooke Phillips, who had appeared on the HBO reality show 'Cathouse.' She was pregnant at the time. 

'Cathouse' documents the Moonlite BunnyRanch in Mound House, Nevada, which is a legal brothel.

Also killed  were Jennifer Ermey, Millie Barrera and Casey Mark Barrientos. Additional murder charges were filed because both Phillips and Barrera were pregnant.

In 2013, the Associated Press reported that 'Investigators allege Barrientos ran a drug and prostitution ring out of a south Oklahoma City house where the victims were killed.' 

The wire service reported that Indian Brotherhood gang member Denny Phillips 'and a second man, David Allen Tyner, 31, allegedly were involved in illegal drug sales with Barrientos and plotted to kill him because they weren't happy with the amount of money they were being paid.' 

Tyner claimed that Denny Phillips - who was not related to Brooke Phillips - encouraged him to commit the murders, according to the Oklahoman. The newspaper reported that Tyner 'is serving life sentences without parole in connection with the crime.'

The Oklahoman, which cited an affidavit, reported that on November 9, 2009, Tyner let Cochran and Russell Lee Hogshooter off near the Oklahoma City home where the murders would take place. Tyner then reportedly went to the house by himself.

Tyner claimed to have murdered Barrientos with a gun - after overhearing gunshots take place in a living room while he was inside a bathroom, the newspaper reported. 

Referring to the affidavit, the Oklahoman said Tyner pursued Barrientos out of the home, got back, and saw the bodies of the slain female bystanders. He also claimed to see Cochran and Hogshooter with knives covered in blood.

The house was lit ablaze by Hogshooter - then he, along with Tyner and Cochran, burned the clothes they were wearing, hid their firearms in the ground, then took off, the Oklahoman reported.

Phillips' trial will take place next month, and Hogshooter's preliminary trial will take place in May, according to the news outlet. District Attorney David Prater told The Oklahoman that families of the victims agreed to the plea deal to secure Cochran's testimony. 

Killed:  Brooke Phillips was pregnant at the time of the November 2009 slaying 

Investigators were informed by Tyner that both Hogshooter and Cochran participated in the attacks, leading to the charges against them, according to the newspaper.

News9 reported that US marshals apprehended Cochran in November as he was getting the mail.

Marshals showed up at Hogshooter's trailer in November, and they arrested him after he attempted to flee, according to the television station. 

Shortly after the November 2009 murders, Moonlite Bunny Ranch owner Deninis Hof told CBS News upon learning of Brooke Phillips' death 'That's terrible, terrible, terrible. We're sad.' 

'It's been the saddest few days of the 54 years at the BunnyRanch,' Hof said at the time.
