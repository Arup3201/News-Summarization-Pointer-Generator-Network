A man whose photo went viral earlier this month after he allegedly groped a woman in Seattle has now been charged with assault.

The city attorney's office said Thursday that Daryl R. Sharma, 36, of Kirkland was charged with one count of assault with sexual motivation, a gross misdemeanor, in the October 12 incident in downtown Seattle.

The city is asking that bail be set at $50,000 at his arraignment Friday in a King County Jail courtroom.

Getting his just desserts: Daryl Sharma, 36, a man with a long history of groping, has been charged with assault with sexual motivation in connection to an October 12 incident in Seattle 

Allegations: Julia Marquand, 28, took a handful of photos of known sex-offender Daryl Sharma, who walked up beside her on a sidewalk near Westlake Park in the city and supposedly touched her inappropriately

The groping incident might have gone unreported, but the woman, 28-year-old Julia Marquand, snapped his picture .

She publicized it on Twitter because she felt a police officer didn't take her complaint seriously. 

Marquand took a handful of photos of known sex offender Daryl Sharma, who walked up beside her on a sidewalk near Westlake Park in broad daylight October 12 and supposedly touched her inappropriately.

After he tried to calmly walk away from the scene, Marquand followed him and took a collection of snaps on her cellphone.

In response, he tried to apologize in what she believed was 'damage control'.

She told Q13 Fox: 'I know the difference between being bumped into and being groped. I pulled out my phone and I just started snapping pictures.'

Marquand contacted the police who recognized him as being under Department of Corrections supervision.

However, officers would not take her images as evidence. But when she uploaded the photos, the response changed the course of the investigation. 

According to Seattle police, over the past 10 days, they have been flooded with more than a dozen reports made by women accusing Sharma of touching them inappropriately.

On Thursday, Ms Marquand told The Seattle Times she felt a sense of 'relief' upon learning that Sharma has been charged.

Relieved: Marquand was glad to hear that her alleged assailant has been charged

Frustration: Marquand handed police the photos of Sharma, but they did not want to use them as evidence

'I don't want this to happen anymore,' she told the paper.

The 28-year-old woman said that the takeaway from this incident is that police should not be dismissive of groping complaints going forward.

‘I think they know they are on watch now, they are aware if they don’t perform their duties correctly people are going to do something about it,’ she said. 

The Seattle Police Department acknowledged Marquand's frustration and  confirmed a detective was contacted by DOC officers after they recognized the man in photos the victim circulated on Twitter.

Sharma is said to have a long history of groping and is a Level 3 sex offender - meaning he is most likely to re-offend.  

In 2012, he was sentenced to 20 months in jail for grabbing a woman's breast on a bench at Seattle's University Village.

He was convicted twice in 2003 on assault charges related to rubbing himself against a woman and groping her breast, and later grabbing another woman’s behind. 

A year earlier, the man was accused of approaching a woman and running his hand through her hair and down her face while making kissing sounds and sexual comments.  

After his actions were noticed on Twitter, Sharma was taken back into custody at the King County Jail  October 15 for allegedly violating the conditions of his supervised release.

Unsettling: Sharma, pictured here holding a child in 2010, served 20 months in jail beginning in 2012 for grabbing a woman's breast

Serial offender: Sharma is said to have a history of groping and following Marquand's tweet, she claims 200 people have come forward with allegations the same man has groped them

A statement from Seattle PD read: 'SPD Sexual Assault detectives and Department of Corrections (DOC) officers have identified a person of interest in a weekend assault on a woman in downtown Seattle. 

'This person of interest is currently being held at the King County Jail for a violation of his DOC supervision.

'Police began investigating the incident after a woman contacted an officer at the West Precinct on October 12th to report a man groped the woman as she walked down the street near Westlake Park.

'The victim photographed the man before contacting police at the West Precinct.

'A West Precinct officer documented the incident, including a detailed description of the suspect, but did not collect the victim's photograph of the suspect at the time of the report.

'The victim, understandably frustrated by the incident, pro-actively circulated a photo of the man via social media, along with an account of her experience reporting the incident. 

'DOC officers contacted SPD detectives about the case after recognizing the man in the photo as a level III sex offender on DOC supervision.

'Police are still investigating the case, but are working to confirm a connection between the man identified by DOC officers and the Westlake incident.;
