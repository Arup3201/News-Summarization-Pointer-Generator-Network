A British father and two children have been killed in head-on crash with a truck as they drove through Croatia on holiday.

The driver of the car, a 37-year-old man, was fatally injured along with the two youngsters in the incident in Slano, near Dubrovnik at 7.50am today.

The man's wife, aged 34, and her eight-year-old son are currently in an intensive care ward at City Hospital in Dubrovnik.

Smashed: According to initial reports, the British car struck a concrete verge at the side of the road and bounced into the path of a truck coming in the opposite direction

Crash scene: The truck was apparently a vehicle used by Croatia's road maintenance organisation

Delays: The road, which is a key route for tourists heading to their holidays in the Croatian coastline, remains closed

Long tailbacks: Police were carrying on with the clean-up operation following the crash

Both of them are still undergoing surgery.  The director
 of the hospital, Jerko Ferri Certic, said the situation was 'very 
difficult' and doctors were still fighting for their lives.

He
 said: 'The mother had internal bleeding and a liver injury and we 
needed to do an urgent operation. The boy had serious injuries to his 
chest.'

No ages or names were available but the British Embassy had been informed, said local police.

The crash 
happened on the Adriatic coast road on the way to Dubrovnik and the 
family were travelling in a BMW 3 series with British number plates, 
indicating that they had driven to the region from the UK.

The crash left two children and their father dead, and the man's wife and a third child critically injured

A spokesman for the Foreign Office said it was aware of the incident in Croatia

There has been a steady increase in British tourists
heading to Croatia in recent years and UK government figures estimate that
around 400,000 British nationals currently visit the country every year.

According to figures released by the Croatian National
Tourist Office, more than 300,000 Brits holidayed in Croatia between
January-August 2013, a boost of 24 per cent on the same period in 2012.

The boom is partly thanks to an increase in flight
availability from the UK to Croatia since 2012, with further plans for
development in the near future. The European Investment Bank has approved a
€120 million (£95million) loan for the expansion of the Zagreb Airport, a key link
with the rest of Europe.

Holidaymakers head to the country's many islands for the
Mediterranean climate, warm dry summers, mild winters and an average of 2,600
hours of sunlight a year, which makes it one of the sunniest coastlines in
Europe.

According
 to initial reports, the British car struck a concrete verge at the side
 of the road and bounced into the path of a truck coming in the opposite
 direction.

The truck was apparently a vehicle used by the country's road maintenance organisation.

The driver of the Croatian truck was not harmed in the crash.

The road, which is a key route for tourists heading to their holidays in the Croatian coastline, remains closed  and the queue of cars caused by the accident was 15 kilometres in both directions.

Police are carrying on with the clean-up operation, according to spokesman Marija Gjenero, speaking to Central European News this morning.

Toys belonging to the children could be seen spilling out of the BMW's boot.

A spokesman for the Foreign Office said: 'We are aware of an incident in Dubrovnik, Croatia and we are in contact with the local authorities.

'We stand ready to provide consulate assistance.'

The road, which is a key route for tourists heading to their holidays in the Croatian coastline, remains closed at the moment
