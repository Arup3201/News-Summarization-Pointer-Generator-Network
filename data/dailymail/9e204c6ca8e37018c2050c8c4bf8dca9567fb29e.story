The frontman of Grammy-nominated Christian band As I Lay Dying has admitted to trying to hire a hit man to kill his estranged wife.

Timothy Lambesis, 32, pleaded guilty to one count of solicitation of murder in Vista Superior Court, near San Diego, today.

The father-of-three was arrested in May last year after giving an undercover agent acting as a hit man, money, gate codes and an alibi to kill his estranged wife, Meggan Lambesis.

The Californian allegedly said he wanted his wife dead because she was going to get up to 60 percent of his income and would not allow their three young children to join him on tour.

Tried to hire a hit man: Timothy Lambesis, co-founder of Christian heavy metal band 'As I Lay Dying', has pleaded guilty to hiring someone to kill his estranged wife

Jail time: Lambesis, 32, could spend nine years behind bars as a result of his plea agreement

NBC San Diego reported Lambesis could serve nine years behind bars as a result of his plea deal when he is sentenced on May 2. He is out on $2 million bail.

According to court documents, Meggan Lambesis filed for divorce in September 2012 to end the couple’s eight-year marriage.

In divorce records obtained by the Associated Press, Meggan Lambesis claimed the rocker had become 'obsessed with bodybuilding' and was distracted with the children, even falling asleep once while watching them.

Last year, as their relationship further soured, Lambesis allegedly told a personal trainer at his gym, Brett Kimball, that he wanted to get rid of his wife.

'He wanted to know if maybe I could find someone to do it for him,' Kimball testified at a pretrial hearing.

Police began an investigation in April following a tip-off.

Father: Lambesis complained his estranged wife wouldn't let him see the three children they adopted from Ethiopia, now aged four, eight and 10

Lambesis was recorded telling an undercover agent that he wanted his wife killed, according to prosecutors.

The
 undercover agent, San Diego County Sheriff's Officer Howard Bradley, 
testified last year that Lambesis met him at an Oceanside bookstore in 
May and said he wanted his wife 'gone'.

Bradley said he asked Lambesis directly if he wanted his wife killed, and the singer replied, 'Yes, I do'.

The heavily-tattooed gym junkie allegedly said his wife had restricted his visits with their children aged four, eight and 10, 
adopted from Ethiopia, after they separated in September 2012.

The
 singer also told the agent that he was angry that Meggan Lambesis would
 get a large share of his income in a divorce settlement.

Bradley said Lambesis told him at the end of their meeting, 'Just to clarify, just so you know, I do want her dead.'

Lambesis
 provided the undercover agent with an envelope containing $1,000 cash 
for expenses, his wife’s address and gate codes, pictures of her and 
specific dates when he would have the children and therefore, an alibi.

Pleaded guilty: Lambesis is out on $3 million bail, with sentencing scheduled for May 2

As
 I Lay Dying formed in San Diego in 2000 and has released six albums, 
including 2007's An Ocean Between Us, which reached No. 8 on 
Billboard's charts.

A single from the album, Nothing Left, was 
nominated for a Grammy for top metal performance.

The
 band plays in an aggressive style that features lightning-speed metal 
guitar riffs.

The group's philosophical lyrics have attracted a 
following of Christian rock fans.

Lambesis has in the past openly declared he was Christian.

He allegedly stated during an August 2010 radio interview on The Full Armor of God Broadcast that his writing was inspired by his Christian faith.

'I can only really write about what I'm passionate about in life, so naturally my faith, my belief in the teachings of Jesus and His resurrection come across in our lyrics,' he said.
