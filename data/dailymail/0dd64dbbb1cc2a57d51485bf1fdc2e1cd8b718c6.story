A callous couple are facing jail for allowing a former champion greyhound to reach a 'horrific' emaciated and flea ridden state.

Andrew and Maria Louden, of Plymouth, Devon, failed to feed Tottie and another retired greyhound called Pebbles or treat Tottie's painful sores, Plymouth magistrates heard today.

Julian Jefferson, representing the Loudens, said both his clients were disabled and on benefits and had found it hard to feed the dogs adequately because their payments had been 'suddenly seized'.

Sorry state: Former racing greyhound champion, Bubbly Tottie, was found 
emaciated, flea-ridden and covered in sores after being neglected by his owners

Neglect: An RSPCA inspector said the treatment Tottie and another greyhound, Pebbles suffered was the worst she had seen in 12 years

An experienced RSPCA inspector said 
the treatment of Tottie, who was once worth £50,000, and Pebbles was the
worst she had witnessed in 12 years in the job.

Magistrates heard that both dogs were 'about to die' when Andrew, 48, and Maria, 49, finally took them for treatment.

Andrew Wyatt, prosecuting for the RSPCA, said the couple took Tottie to a PDSA animal hospital on October 4 last year.

Staff said the dog was emaciated, flea-ridden and had sores on its hind quarters.

Pebbles was also examined by a vet and found to be in a similarly poor state and close to death.

Mr
Wyatt said Tottie, known as ‘Bubbly Tottie’, had previously won the 
greyhound St Leger, a famous competition at Wimbledon Stadium, and once 
changed hands for £50,000.

'Callous': Andrew and Maria Louden both admitted two charges of causing unnecessary suffering to the dogs. There are more pictures of Tottie's injuries which are too distressing to show

The Loudens both admitted two charges of causing unnecessary suffering to the dogs.

They today
pleaded guilty at Plymouth Magistrates' Court to failing to adequately feed the pets and get 
veterinary attention for Tottie’s sores between September 20 and October
4 last year.

They also admitted to failing to protect both dogs from pain and suffering in not treating their flea infestations.

Plymouth magistrates adjourned sentencing whilst a probation officer prepares a report on the Louden's backgrounds.

Presiding magistrate Diana Baumer said all options, including custody, should be considered when they are punished on April 23.

Speaking after the case, RSPCA Inspector Sarah Morris, said: 'This was horrifying. It has scarred me I think. It is just so unnecessary. Dog food does not cost very much.'

Both greyhounds have since made full recoveries and have been happily re-homed.
