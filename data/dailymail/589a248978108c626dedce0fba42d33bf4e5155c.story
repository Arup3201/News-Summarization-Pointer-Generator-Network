TV adventurer Bear Grylls - who conquered Everest aged just 23 and has endured some of the most extreme conditions on the planet - has ripped out a steel slide on his private island to avoid a showdown with planning officials.

The UK's chief scout installed the controversial slide on St Tudwal's West off the Welsh coast and posted a picture on his Twitter page.

But Gwynedd Council began investigating to see if the former SAS soldier broke planning rules as the island is an area of outstanding natural beauty.

Safety concerns: Mr Grylls posted this picture of 
the slide on his Twitter account saying: 'New slide attached at home on 
our island! You hit the water very fast!!!!' which sparked the investigation. It has now been removed

And father of three Grylls has now taken it down - and assured a local councillor the slide was never intended to be a permanent fixture.

County councillor Wyn Williams said the slide had been removed for the winter. Mr Williams said: 'He was never going to leave it there.

'He stays there during August and he told me that it's not a permanent fixture. He would not allow it to be a permanent fixture in the winter months.'

Mr Williams said Grylls would speak to the council before putting the slide back up next year in case he needs permission.

St Tudwal West lies around just over half a mile off Gwynedd's Llyn peninsula.

The rocky grass-covered island is about 700m long and 200m wide.

Mr Williams said: 'However, I don't believe you should be allowed to erect a slide in an area of outstanding natural beauty such as St Tudwal's Island before going through correct procedures.'

'I am very concerned that an accident could happen on this slide, since there have been no discussions with planning or the health and safety department of Gwynedd Council.'

Along with the photograph, Mr Grylls, 39, tweeted: 'New slide attached at home on our island! You hit the water very fast!!!!'

Home: St Tudwals Island (pictured in the distance) is just off the Abersoch coastline in North Wales. Councillors feared there could be an accident on the slide and planning permission could be required

Beauty spot: The island, which Mr Grylls bought in 2001, is about 2,000ft long and about 650ft wide

Eton-educated Edward 'Bear' Grylls 
bought the island in 2001 for £95,000. He has submitted an application 
to build a £580,000 harbour at St Tudwal’s West to improve access.

According to the application the current jetty is ‘exposed’ and arrival 
and exit to the island can sometimes be ‘dangerous.’

Along
with his wife Shara, and their three sons, Jesse, Marmaduke and 
Huckleberry, they split their time between the island and their other 
home, a Dutch barge in London.
