In jail for late library books: Jory Enck was locked up after he failed to return a study guide he borrowed in 2010

They take law breaking seriously in the town of Copperas Cove, Texas, where police are regularly arresting people who do not return their library books on time.

The latest to be locked up for the offence had a book checked out for three years.

Jory Enck was booked into jail for overdue library materials.

Court documents show he checked out a study guide in 2010 and didn't respond to attempts from the library to get the book back.

City of Copperas Cove Municipal Judge Bill Price said the patrons are usually released on a £150 ($240) bond after the arrest.

Library policies show the patron must have the overdue book checked out for a minimum of 90 days and not respond to phone calls or emails from the library about the book before the municipal court is notified.

Julie Lehmann with the Copperas Cove Police Department said if an officer makes a routine stop or encounters a patron with an active overdue library materials warrant on a call they will make the arrest.

Judge Price said in situations where library materials are not returned they usually try to let the civil process sort it out and if that doesn't work a warrant is issued, which doesn't result in a pleasant response from patrons.

Judge Price said: 'Universal hatred, nobody wants to get arrested over a library book.

'The other side of that is people that go to our library and can't have these materials, they're put out too.'

The ordinance was adopted by the city almost four years ago and some locals are not happy with the library warrants being regularly issued.

Copperas Cove resident Clyde Glosson said: 'I guess that they have to have some way to enforce the rules at the library to return borrowed material.

'I think that's a little extreme personally and I'll certainly talk to the mayor to maybe get that changed.'

Enck's library card was found inside the book now back at the library with records showing the book was turned in the day after his arrest.
