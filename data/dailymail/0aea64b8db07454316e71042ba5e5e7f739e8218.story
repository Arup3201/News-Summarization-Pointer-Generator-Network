A new parody video takes aim at the wage inequality between genders by introducing a fictional Amazon Prime service that caters to the average woman, who earns just 78 cents for every dollar a man in the same job makes.

Comedian and filmmaker Paul Gale created the satirical ad for 'Amazon Prime for Women', which is marketed as the online retailer's attempt to make itself more appealing to its female members, who make less money than their male counterparts. 

'We realized that some customers can afford more than others, so we are introducing Amazon Prime for Women, a new service that offers 78per cent of each item for 78per cent of the price,' actress Lauren Ireland says in the YouTube clip.

Special deal: The video shows that women can buy more than three quarters a box a cereal for 78per cent of the original price

She continues: 'It's perfect for the average working woman who earns 78per cent as much as a man with the exact same job.'

Cartoon pictures show that women can now buy three quarters of a box of cereal, books, umbrellas and sweaters – all at a special female rate.

'It's the Prime service you love at a price you can afford when you are taking home three quarters of what a man would for being equally as productive,' she says.

Miss Ireland notes that there is also a specific service for black women, who earn 64per cent to every man's dollar, and Hispanic women who make only 54per cent.

And while the video appears to poke fun at the current wage gap, the facts behind the funny side of the clip are brutally correct.

According to the American Association of University Women, the typical white woman working full-time in the United States made 78per cent of men's earnings in 2013, while black women made 64per cent and Hispanic women took home a mere 54per cent.

'Regardless of the exact [wage gap] numbers, there's a systemic inequality embedded in our society, whether it's regarding gender, race, or sexual orientation,' Mr Gale told The Huffington Post. 

He added: 'To have a platform to point at it in my own way and say 'Hey, this! We should talk about this!' is something I'm grateful to be able to do.'

Mr Gale debuted the video on YouTube just days before last Sunday's International Women's Day, which saw the Clinton Foundation's release of We're Not There Yet, a PSA featuring Amy Poehler, Cameron Diaz, Sienna Miller, Padma Lakshmi and Jenny Slate's voices as they discussed issues surrounding gender equality.

The video is a part of the Not There Yet campaign, which removed women from ads on International Women's Day, to call attention to the fact  we still have a long way to go before both sexes are truly equal politically, socially and economically.
