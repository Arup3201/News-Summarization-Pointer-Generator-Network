An American Airlines flight was forced to make an emergency landing when its cabin walls began to break apart as terrified passengers looked on.

Flyer James Wilson said travellers on Monday's flight from San Francisco to Dallas knew something was wrong when they felt the fuselage begin to shake violently and heard popping noises outside the Boeing 757 shortly after take-off.

Astonished travellers feared the plane would crash as interior panels on both sides of the cabin pulled apart from the walls, exposing insulation, and they felt a change in cabin pressure due to a possible blown air duct.

Passenger James Wilson asked his Facebook friends to 'pray for us' after the plane 'started coming apart'

James Wilson said crew members were ‘pulling the panels apart and looking for daylight behind there'

An American Airlines spokesman says a blown air duct is being investigated as the possible cause 

Mr Wilson, from Kyle, Texas, told the Associated Press: ‘It was the whole Row 14 on all sides, from the floor to the ceiling.'

He told ABC7: ‘All of a sudden (we heard) this loud pop, pop, pop … really loud and this ripping sound. It sounded like bowling balls were falling from the overhead bins.

‘It was terrifying. We didn’t know what was going on.

‘We were all shouting for the flight crew, “Come look the walls are caving in!”.’ 

The 32-year-old race car driver, who was seated in Row 16, said crew members were ‘pulling the panels apart and looking for daylight behind there.’

Fearing the worst, he posted photographs and updates during a live-blog on his Facebook page and sent text messages to his wife, who was supposed to meet him in Dallas, so she would know what happened in case of a crash.

He pleaded with his Facebook friends to call his wife just in case his text messages didn't go through, writing: 'American Flight 2293 depressurized and started coming apart mid air. Please pray for us.'

Mr Wilson added: 'My texts may not have made it to my wife please call her asap.'

His anxious friends tracked the aircraft’s flight path online and posted messages of encouragement after the plane aborted its journey.

One friend wrote: 'I can't imagine the thoughts racing through your head right now. Prayers and God Speed for a safe landing!'

Another added: 'Flight aware says you are 8 minutes out. hang on buddy!'

James Wilson kept his family and friends updated with frequent Facebook updates

Despite the tense situation, Mr Wilson tried to remain calm and managed to crack a few jokes while trading messages with his Facebook friends.

The race car driver wrote: ‘Bad form to put my helmet on? Passengers probably don't need the bad vibes.'

Despite concerns from fearful passengers, the captain announced that Flight 2293 would continue to Dallas/Fort Worth International Airport because the cabin pressure was stable.

But he soon changed his mind after exiting the cockpit and seeing the damage for himself. The plane turned around near the California-Nevada boundary and made an emergency landing in San Francisco, where it was met on the tarmac by firefighters.

None of the 184 passengers or six crew was injured.

Mr Wilson alerted his Facebook friends when the plane finally touched down: 'Landed!!!!!!!'

His profile was flooded with messages of relief from family and friends who were gripped by the ordeal.

One friend wrote: 'Glad you and everyone on-board is safe. Good job pilots.'

Another added: 'Glad you are ok. I think it is safe to say you are the most interesting man in the world with all the crazy stuff that happens to you!'

His wife, Allison, soon joined the thread to offer her gratitude: 'Thanks to all of you for reaching out to me with phone calls, voice mails and texts. What an inconvenient time to be driving through an area with no cell phone coverage. James is so blessed to have a wonderful network of friends!'

Panic: Passengers feared the worst after the plane's cabin walls cracked loose shortly after take-off

Mr Wilson was able to board another flight and travel to Austin, Texas, late Monday night, but he complained about American Airlines' customer service because the carrier asked passengers to call a telephone number to organise their own transportation.

American Airlines spokesman Matt Miller said the cause of the incident is being investigated as a possible blown air duct.

He said the cabin did not lose pressure and oxygen masks did not deploy. 

 Passenger James Wilson says he doesn't plan on flying again anytime soon after the harrowing ordeal

Mr Miller added: ‘We had some very professional flight attendants and they did a very good job keeping people calm. They said “It's just cosmetic”.’

Robert Ditchey, an aeronautical engineer, told AP that cabin wall panels are not part of the plane’s structure and have ‘no meaning to the safety of the plane structure.’

The plane has been taken out of service while it undergoes inspections and repairs.

The US Federal Aviation Administration said it will work with American Airlines to identify and correct the problem before the aircraft flies again.
