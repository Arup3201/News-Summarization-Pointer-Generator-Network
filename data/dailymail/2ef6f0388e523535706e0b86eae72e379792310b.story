Around 2.6 million years ago, the first stone tools began appearing in the archaeological record.

But now researchers have found that our early ancestors may have had the ability to use stone tools around half a million years earlier.

Far from being the fumbling creatures we believed, a look at fossils of Australopithecus africanus reveals the species had human-like hands capable of 'squeeze' gripping.

Dr Matthew Skinner and Dr Tracy Kivell from Kent University analysed on the internal spongy structure of bone called trabeculae.

This remodels quickly during a lifetime and can reflect the behaviour of individuals, as well as how they use their hands.

The researchers compared scans of Australopithecus africanus and modern ape hand bones with scans of hand bones from modern species.

This included a 90,000-year-old Homo sapiens, two roughly 60,000-year-old Neandertals, Romans and Egyptian Nubians who lived between about 1,500 and 2,000 years ago.

They found humans and Neanderthals had hands capable of holding items between the thumb and fingertips.

The researchers found that Australopithecus africanus had human-like hands that were capable of precision grips.

This would have helped them squeeze small objects, such a stone tools.

These early members of the human family tree also had an opposable thumb. 

These hand features may have evolved from earlier human ancestors that hadlong fingers and short thumbs, which climbing trees. 

The researchers said it is possible the patterns in the bone were created by handling stone flakes and cutting meat.

It is equally plausible that they could be using it to access various vegetable materials like potatoes, yams, they said. 

The Australopithecus africanus fossils, excavated at South Africa’s Swartkrans Cave, had concentrations of spongy bone at the base of the thumb and in the knuckles of the third and fifth fingers - similar to homo sapiens.

Meanwhile, chimpanzees, gorillas, orangutans and gibbons show a different pattern of spongy bone distribution in their hands, caused by tree climbing.  

This means that even if Australopithecus africanus had not been considered as toolmakers before, they were at least prepared to handle stone tools with a precision grip.

Their findings cast doubt on the long-standing assumption that Homo habilis was the first hominin toolmaker.

It follows research that emerged last week he first conversation between our ancestors was about DIY and likely took place between 2.5 to 1.8 million years ago.

This study found stone tool-making drove the evolution of language among our human ancestors in the African savannah.

Researchers found clear differences between humans, who have the ability for precision gripping between thumb and fingers, and chimpanzees, who are unable to do this. Fossils analysis revealed Australopithecus africanus (second left), also had a human-like trabecular bone pattern

Australopithecus africanus had ape-like face proportions, including a flat nose, a strongly projecting lower jaw

It suggests communication among our earliest ancestors may have been more complex than previously thought, and that tool-making helped drive evolution.

Australopithecus africanus was one of the longest-lived early human species. So far, paleoanthropologists have uncovered remains from more than 300 individuals in Eastern Africa.

The species survived for more than 900,000 years, which is over four times as humans.

Previous studies into Australopithecus africanus has found that they had a mixture of primitive features and of more advanced features typical of later human species.

Their children grew rapidly after birth and reached adulthood earlier than modern humans.

They had ape-like face proportions, including a flat nose, a strongly projecting lower jaw. They are believed to have had small brains, which were a third of the size of a human brain.

Marks (shown in the green boxes) suggest the use of the bone fragment for carved sharpening the cutting edges of stone tools

Neanderthals have a reputation for being lumbering, cavemen with low IQs, but a new discovery suggests they may have been more intelligent than we think.

A 60,000-year-old multi-purpose bone tool unearthed in France suggests Neanderthals understood how to use bones to make useful devices.

This skill was previously attributed to our species, Homo sapiens, and casts a new light on evolution 250,000 to 28,000 years ago.

'This is the first time a multi-purpose bone tool from this period has been discovered,' said Luc Doyon from the University of Montreal.

'It was long thought that before Homo sapiens, other species did not have the cognitive ability to produce this type of artefact.

'This discovery reduces the presumed gap between the two species and prevents us from saying that one was technically superior to the other.' 

The tool was uncovered during annual digs at the Grotte du Bison at Arcy-sur-Cure in Burgundy, France.

Extremely well preserved, the tool comes from the left femur of an adult reindeer and its age is estimated between 55,000 and 60,000 years old.
