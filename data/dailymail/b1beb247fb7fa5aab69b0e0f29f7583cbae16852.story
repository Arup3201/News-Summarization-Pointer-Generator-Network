Wanted: Police are hunting the real-life 'Barbie' girl after she allegedly stole from a man she met in a night club

Police are hunting a real-life 'Barbie' girl who allegedly robbed a man's home after she met him in a nightclub.

The unnamed blonde and her brunette friend went back to the victim's property in Logwood Place, Wigan, after a night out.

But the man woke up the following morning to find the women had left the property and a watch, TV and cash had been stolen.

Police issued a picture of the blonde suspect -
who calls herself Barbie and who speaks with a Liverpool accent - hugging her brunette associate during the night out.

Officers have already traced 
and questioned her 23-year-old friend over the incident.

Greater Manchester Police said the
thefts occurred in the early hours of November 2 when the unnamed man 
returned to his flat in Wigan, Greater Manchester, with the two women he had
met earlier in the evening.

Pc Graeme Pendlebury added: 'The victim opened his home only to find his belongings stolen the following morning.

'We are keen to speak to the women in the picture and I would urge her or anyone who knows who she is to contact us.'
