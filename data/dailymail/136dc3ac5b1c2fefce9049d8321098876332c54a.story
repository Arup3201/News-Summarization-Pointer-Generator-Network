A Briton tonight scooped a mind-boggling £81million by landing the EuroMillions jackpot.

The mystery winner's gargantuan haul is not the largest ever won on the lottery but puts the ticket-holder sixth on the National Lottery Rich List.

Winning £80million would make you the joint 908th richest person in the country, according to The Sunday Times Rich List 2012.

The British winner will enjoy £81million, the sixth biggest jackpot in National Lottery History

The lucky winner is just £10million short of Queen guitar legend Brian May who is worth £90m, but is four times richer than Adele at £20million.

A National Lottery spokesman said: 'We've been giving the rest of Europe a chance to win big this year but Lady Luck is clearly shining back down on the UK once again.

'This new jackpot winning ticket-holder flies into sixth place in the exclusive National Lottery Rich List just behind an anonymous ticket-holder who won £84.4million in May 2010.

The winner will be four times richer than songstress Adele, but still £10m short of music icon Brian May

'The run of luck for UK players doesn't end there - this Friday, EuroMillions Millionaire Raffle guarantees that one lucky ticket-holder will win £1million a month for a whole year.

'To be in with a chance of becoming a millionaire twelve times over, National Lottery players need to buy a ticket for Friday's EuroMillions draw.'

Tuesday's winning numbers were 34,38,13,08,26 and the Lucky Star numbers were 03 and 11.
