Tom Hanks has praised late actor Michael Clarke Duncan for possessing a touch of 'magic'.

The legendary Forrest Gump star has paid tribute to his late Green Mile co-star, paving the way for fellow celebrities showing their support since the tragic passing of the 54-year-old today.

Tom, who shared the screen with Michael back in 1999 for the Frank Darabont-directed film, also affectionately referred to the gentle 6ft 5in, 300-pound giant as 'Big Mike'.

In a statement today, Tom said: 'I am
terribly saddened at the loss of Big Mike. He was the treasure we all 
discovered on the set of The Green Mile. He was magic.'

Hanks added: 'He was a big love of man and his passing leaves us stunned.'

Darabont also released a statement, explaining he was 'devastated'. He said: '[Michael was] one of the finest people I’ve ever had the privilege to work with 
or know. Michael was the gentlest of souls - an exemplar of decency, 
integrity and kindness. The sadness I feel is inexpressible.'

Their film, based on the Stephen King novel of the same name, starred Tom as a corrections officer at a penitentiary in the 1930s, with Michael taking on the role of convicted murderer John Coffey.
