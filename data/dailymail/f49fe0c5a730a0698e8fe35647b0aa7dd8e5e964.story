Taken down: A lingerie advert has been banned from Australian television by censors for being too sexist

Created by Crisp Advertising in North Adelaide, its message was designed to convey that Innerware Lingerie offered free bra fittings.

But the board ruled that the content breached a section of the advertising standards code which stipulates that 'advertising or marketing communications shall treat sex, sexuality and nudity with sensitivity to the relevant audience,' reported The Australian.

'The board considered that the advertisement did have a strong sexual suggestion with the combination of the woman wearing lingerie, her sexualised strutting, the focus on her body and the sexualised conversation,' the case report said.

Innerware Lingerie's owners Evan and Tina Zorba have now altered the advert and it is back on Australian television.

Mr Zorba said: 'The idea was about having fun with it, we didn't want to offend anyone, it was a bit cheeky.'

In June a television commercial starring 
Pamela Anderson and a lesser-known actress exposing their bras and 
cleavages was banned for being sexist and degrading to women.

The
 45-year-old Baywatch star and her assistant Vanessa are shown in an 
office boardroom full of businessmen in the banned advert for  domain and web hosting company Dreamscape Networks. 

While
 the assistant pours coffee and cream, her cleavage is revealed to one 
of the men, Adam, who then fantasises about the pair dancing in bikinis.

Advertising watchdogs upheld complaints from four viewers.

Last year a car advert featuring scantily-clad burlesque dancers was banned after watchdogs branded it sexist.

They were concerned that it featured ‘a number of shots of the women’s breasts and bottoms, in which their heads were obscured’.

The way the women had been presented in the Renault Clio advert ‘invited viewers to see them as sexual objects’, it was ruled.

The Advertising Standards Authority, who were alerted by just one complaint, banned the advert – which appears only on the internet – after rejecting the French car-maker’s contention that it was a parody of a typically French Moulin Rouge-style cabaret scene.

They ruled it was ‘sexually provocative’ and ‘objectified the dancers by portraying them as sexual objects’.
