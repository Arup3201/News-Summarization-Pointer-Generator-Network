Feeling a bit strapped for cash but still want to let your hair down this festive season?

An American company has invented a range of products that will help skint revellers smuggle alcohol into their office party or local nightclub, swerving inflated drinks prices at the bar.  

The website 'Smuggle your Booze' has a selection of products that conceal booze for sale, including fake hand cream bottles, bra stuffing and tampon holders.

A website called Smuggle Your Booze has a range of fake products that help to get contraband alcohol past bouncers. Pictured is the hand sanitiser combo pack, priced at $11.99 (£7.70)

The site says: 'At a concert, festival, beach, fair or sporting event, our product is there with you.

'It's the new and convenient way to bring your beverage of choice to any event, anywhere.'

'Our products have been tested and have gotten in to all events listed above undetected, no hassle.'

It claims one of the best products for passing through security undetected is the tampon holder, priced at $10 (£6.40), because bouncers are generally male and tend to skim over female hygiene-related products. 

The site promises security won't even glance at their fake tampons, priced at $10 (£6.40) 

The site says: 'Guys won't even look at a tampon, much less handle it at security.

'The tampon shot holder will never be questioned at your venue.'

Product users from Amazon are generally happy with the product.

One user of the hand sanitiser combo pack, priced at $11.99 (£7.70), wrote: 'Amazing product. Nobody gives this a second glance in my handbag. Great for concerts and nights where alcohol is very expensive.'

The reviews for the 'boobie bag,' priced at $12 (£7.70) said they were extremely easy to hide 

Another user wrote about the shot tubes and tampon wrappers, saying: 'Took these to a festival and they worked perfectly.'

The reviews for the 'boobie bag,' priced at $12 (£7.70) said: 'I ordered these for a festival and they were great and easy to hide.'

Prices for the products start from £6.40 from the company's official website.
