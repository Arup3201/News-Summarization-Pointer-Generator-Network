Despite Britain being considered a culinary melting pot, the average Brit can only cook four foreign dishes - spaghetti Bolognese, curry, stir fry and risotto, a study revealed

And we are woefully lacking in global gastronomic knowledge, with more than half (60 per cent) unaware that gazpacho is Spanish and more than a quarter (30 per cent) unsure of what a falafel is. 

The findings also showed that there is a staggering £240 million worth of unused herbs and spices going to waste in the kitchen cupboard - with 13 per cent of the nation hoarding spices that are more than four years old.

The average homeowner has ten different types of herbs and spices in their their kitchen

The average homeowner has ten different types of herbs and spices in their kitchen, with basil, chilli and oregano the ones we use most when cooking at home. 

Exotic ingredients including ras el hanout (North African spice mix),  star anise and marjoram are the three Brit cooks use the least.

The research by Kenwood suggests our reluctance to experiment with more adventurous dishes is to blame.

1. Spaghetti Bolognese (70%)

2. Indian Curry (62%)

3. Chinese Stir Fry (60%)

4. Risotto (40%)

5. Mexican Chilli (39%)

6. BBQ Ribs (32%)

7. Thai Curry (30%)

8. Caesar salad (28%)

9. Paella (25%)

10. Lamb tagine (18%)

1. Basil (44%)

2. Chilli (41%)

3. Oregano (30%)

4. Coriander (30%)

5. Ginger (29%)

6. Rosemary (28%)

7. Paprika (22%)

8. Parsley (19%)

9. Cinnamon (19%)

10. Thyme (17%)

Astonishingly, the research revealed 60 per cent don't know that gazpacho comes from Spain, and 30 per cent are not sure what a falafel is, with seven per cent confusing it with baklava, a rich, sweet pastry made of layers of filo, chopped nuts and honey, and a further seven per cent believing it is an unleavened flatbread.

It also found 17 per cent (one in six) can cook no more than one international dish and more than a quarter (27 per cent) use ready-made sauces rather than starting from scratch.

Meanwhile, 25 per cent admit they have to rely on takeaways or restaurants to get their foreign food fix.

Two thirds (62 per cent) have cooked an Indian curry at home, yet just one in seven (15 per cent) have added turmeric to their dishes, 10 per cent have experimented with mustard seeds and a mere two per cent tried cooking with cardamom.

Food historian Seren Evans-Charrington said: 'The British palate has continually embraced new flavours and cuisines through the ages.

Lacking in knowledge: 60% of Brits are unaware that gazpacho (left) comes from Spain more than a quarter (30%) are unsure of what a falafel (right) is, with 7% believing its a sweet dessert rather than a savoury snack 

'But perhaps we are more open to tasting and experiencing 'new' dishes than cooking them.

'In the home kitchen, when a family needs to be fed, it can be easy to stick to a repertoire of tried and tested recipes.'

Seb Goff, Kenwood Trade Marketing Manager, added: 'We were staggered how many millions of pounds worth of herbs and spices are going to waste.

'We know Brits continually embrace new flavours and cuisines, but it seems we're not confident enough to experiment with them in our own homes.'

The company has teamed up with six chefs,  Matt Tebbutt, Andy Bates, Celia Brooks, Shelina Permalloo, Zoe Adjonyoh and Anjum Anand to create downloadable e-booklet Around the World in 80 Plates, designed to encourage home cooks to try creating exotic dishes from scratch.
