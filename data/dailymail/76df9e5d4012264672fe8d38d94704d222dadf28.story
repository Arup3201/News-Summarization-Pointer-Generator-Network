Republican Senatorial candidate Liz Cheney had to pay a fine for incorrectly filing for a resident fishing license and lying about how long she had lived in the state of Wyoming.

The revelation is problematic for the former Vice President's daughter since she already faces claims that she is a 'carpetbagger' for buying a house in Wyoming so close to the election filing deadline.

Liz, the 47-year-old daughter of Dick Cheney, moved from her home state of Virginia and bought a house in Jackson Hole, Wyoming in 2012 and is now trying to oust the sitting Republican Senator Mike Enzi.

Timing trouble: Liz Cheney mistakenly applied for a resident's fishing license even though she hadn't lived in Wyoming long enough to qualify, just adding to her image as a carpetbagger

The Jackson Hole News and Guide reported on Thursday that Cheney had to post a $220 bond because she made false statements in order to gain a fishing license.

She applied for the fishing license in 2012, just months after buying a four-bedroom, four-bath home that had a listing price of $1.9million.

The problem with her application is that the state requires applicants to verify that they have 'have domiciled in Wyoming for not less than one year and have not claimed residence anywhere for any purpose during the one year immediately preceding the purchase of this license'.

She issued a statement in response to the news of her oversight, saying that she did not know that there was a year-long requirement and said the clerk who sold it to her never mentioned it.

She gave a lengthy explanation, which Buzzfeed's Zeke Miller published, saying that she was in town to go fisihing on the Snake River with a group of Wounded Warrior veterans and a news crew to film the activity so that it could later be aired on Fox News.

'I didn't know whether I would fish that day, but wanted to have a license just in case. When I went in  to purchase a license, the clerk asked if I was a resident. I said yes because I was living in Wyoming,' she said in the statement.

While the clerk may not have told her all of the information, she too had to sign the form twice saying that she complied with all of the rules and regulations that were stated on the form.

In wake of the $220 bond that she had to pay for misfiling the form, it would have been cheaper should she have paid for a non-resident's license for $92 rather thant he cheaper resident's fee of $24.

This is not the only piece of paperwork that has gotten Cheney in trouble.

She and her husband were also two months late on their property taxes.

She and her husband Philip Perry allegedly thought that when they bought their home- built with logs overlooking the Teton Range- they thought that the seller paid the taxes for the first half of the year.

Cheney said that the reason for their delay in paying the taxes is because the notifications were sent to her house in McLean, Virginia, but the family had moved to Wyoming by that time.

'As soon as we learned the tax hadn’t been paid for the first half of the year, we paid the tax,' she said earlier this month.
