Tony Blair has warned of the political, economic and emotional dangers of Scotland voting for independence

Tony Blair has warned against 'ripping up the alliance' between Scotland and England in a rare intervention in the referendum debate.

The former Prime Minister, who was born in Edinburgh, said: 'Obviously I hope that Scotland votes to stay part of the United Kingdom.'

Mr Blair has avoided campaigning for a No vote as he knows he remains a divisive character north of the Border in the wake of the Iraq War.

In his autobiography, the former Labour leader claimed he was to blame for the party's humiliating defeat by the SNP in 2007, and the Nationalists have repeatedly described him as 'toxic'.

But supporters insist he made one of the greatest all-time speeches in favour of the Union in 2006, when he warned Scotland against turning in on itself with the nationalist 'politics of grievance'.

Speaking at a security conference in the Ukrainian capital of Kiev at the weekend, he said: 'To rip up the alliance between our countries would not be sensible, politically, economically or even emotionally.'

Born in Edinburgh, Mr Blair went to school in Durham before returning to Scotland to attend Edinburgh's Fettes College. His father was born in Yorkshire but grew up in Glasgow.

In his final speech to a Scottish Labour conference in Oban in 2006, he famously said: 'I detest this narrow nationalism not because it engenders fear but because it squanders hope.'

Ex-Chancellor Alistair Darling, leader of Better Together, has previously called for his former boss to play his part in a 'call to arms' to keep the UK together.

But Mr Blair has been reluctant to speak out, in stark contrast with his successor, Gordon Brown, who has returned to frontline politics to fight for the Union.

Meanwhile, the journalist who first claimed Mr Blair's government had 'sexed up' a dossier on Saddam Hussein has described the SNP's proposals for independence as 'every bit as dodgy'.

In May 2003, then-BBC journalist Andrew Gilligan said a claim that Hussein could fire weapons of mass destruction in 45 minutes had been included in a dossier even though the UK Government knew it was probably 'wrong'.

He said that originally the dossier had contained little that was new, but in the week before publication Downing Street had ordered it to be 'sexed up' and new facts 'discovered' to make it more exciting.

In yesterday's Sunday Telegraph, Mr Gilligan wrote: 'As the BBC reporter who first exposed those lies, I believe that Scotland is being led over a cliff by a dossier every bit as dodgy as the one that took us into Iraq.

'Like the whole of Britain in 2003, Scotland in 2014 is being asked to fix a problem that does not exist. Back then, it was an imaginary threat from Iraq. Now, it is an imaginary threat to the NHS, 45 minutes from destruction if you vote No.

'Back then, it was the supposed 'clash of civilisations' between Islam and the West. Now, it is a supposed 'fundamental conflict of social values' between two nations, England and Scotland – whose social values, all surveys show, are extremely similar.

'And just as in 2003, Scotland is also being asked to tackle another problem that is real and does exist – but in a way that will only make that problem worse, for itself, and for all of us. Back then, we were told that invading Iraq would protect us from international terrorism. In fact, of course, it gave international terrorism a boost beyond al-Qaeda's wildest hopes and dreams.

'Now, Scots are told that independence will protect them from global capitalism. They are told that a new international border at Gretna will form a magic shield against the City, the Tories, and the cuts.'
