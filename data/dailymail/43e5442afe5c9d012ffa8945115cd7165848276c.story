Bobby Keys, the saxophonist who played with the Rolling Stones, Eric Clapton and Buddy Holly, has died at the age of 70 at his home in Tennessee.

According to friends Keys had been suffering with long-term liver problems following his well-documented problems with alcohol and heroin.

While he played with many Rock 'n Roll legends during the 60s and 70s, Keys was best known for his work with the Stones - including tracks Brown Sugar, Live With Me, and Emotional Rescue.

In a statement, the band said: 'The Rolling Stones are devastated by the loss of their very dear friend and legendary saxophone player, Bobby Keys. 

'Bobby made a unique musical contribution to the band since the 1960s. He will be greatly missed.' 

'He was a good friend and an inspiration to play with,' said
long-time friend and Nashville rock veteran Michael Webb, who
performed with Keys in a band of Southern rock all-stars called
Bobby Keys and the Suffering Bastards.

He added: 'About two months ago, he started wrestling with his health.He has been in and out of (the hospital) several times.' 

Keys initially made a name for himself playing sax for Buddy Holly at the tender age of 15 in Texas, before playing on Elvis Presley's 'Return to Sender.'

From there he was picked up by Eric Clapton for the Derek and the Dominos project and made his way to London, where he fell in with George Harrison, John Lennon, and Keith Moon.

He met the Stones in the mid-'60s while they were on the same bill in San Antonio, Texas, and was distraught that the British rockers had recorded a cover of Buddy Holly's Not Fade Away.

'I said, "Hey, that was Buddy's song",' Keys recalled in Richards' memoir Life, published in 2010. 

'Who are these pasty-faced, funny-talking, skinny-legged guys to come over here and cash in on Buddy's song?'

Keys started playing sax for Buddy Holly, and met the Stones when they came to Texas. Outraged that they had covered a Holly song, he went to confront them but was so impressed he joined them instead

Keys (far right, on stage with Mick Jagger, Keith Richards and Charlie Watts) became famous for his nights of partying. He once missed a Stones show after taking a bath in Dom Perignon champagne

But once Keys listened more closely, he decided the Stones were playing 'actual rock and roll', an opinion the Stones more than shared about Keys.

He first recorded with the Stones in the late 1960s, and toured and recorded with them off and on over the following decades.

While it was Keys' sax playing that had made him famous, he would soon become infamous for his nights of boozing and drug-taking.

Despite being a close friend of the Stones, he was allegedly banned from touring with the group for 10 years in 1973 after filling a bathtub full of Dom Perignon champagne, going for a dip, and then failing to make a show.

Around the same time he also sought help for his heroin addiction, which, according to his autobiography, he picked up after touring with Jagger. 

Keys was not a full-time member of the Stones but frequently
led the horn section when the band went into the studio or on
the road.

Keys split with the band in 1973 after becoming addicted to heroin, but managed to clean himself up before playing with the group again (pictured left alongside Ron Wood)

Keys wrote about his wild lifestyle, including taking heroin with Keith Richards and filling a bath with champagne, in his autobiography Every Night's A Saturday Night (pictured left signing a copy for a fan)

He also helped the band work on seminal albums such as 'Let It Bleed,' 'Sticky Fingers,' 'Exile on Main St.' and 'Goats Head Soup.' 

During the making of Exile on Main Street, Keys was also open about his drug and alcohol use, once saying: 'Hell, yeah, there was some pot around, there was some whiskey bottles around, there was scantily clad women. Hell, it was rock'n'roll!'

Keith Richards also paid tribute today, saying: 'I have lost the largest pal in the world and I can't express the sense of sadness I feel, although Bobby would tell me to cheer up.'
