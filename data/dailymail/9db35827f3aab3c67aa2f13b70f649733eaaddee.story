George W. Bush has called for the stigmatizing word 'disorder' to be removed from Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder, which he claims hinders military veterans' transition into civilian life.

The former president told a George W. Bush Institute summit this week that some veterans are reluctant to seek help and that employers often don't realize the condition can be treated.

'As a result of public misunderstanding, employers sometimes cite it as a reason for not hiring vets,' Bush said.

'As most doctors today will tell you, post-traumatic stress is not a disorder. Post-traumatic stress or PTS is an injury that can result from the experience of war. And like other injuries, PTS is treatable.'

Moving forward: Former President George W. Bush believes PTSD should stop being called a disorder because it stops employers from hiring sufferers

ABC News reported that, according to the U.S. Department 
of Veterans Affairs which still uses the designation 'PTSD', about 30
 percent of post 9/11 veterans suffer from the malady, which hinders 
their reintegration into civilian society.

The result is that many former troops struggle to find work and often lack the necessary skills to move into employment.

Bush said his institute has been working with Syracuse University to study these issues and the results will be released in spring.

He said the information will help employers understand what veterans have to offer, noting that both veterans and employers have a hard time translating military experience.

'You don't see many job postings that say: 'Wanted: Experience hunting insurgents and terrorists. Willing to risk life for co-workers',' Bush said.

'Or what's a veteran supposed to put down? My last office was a Humvee?'

He told ABC News that he 'has a duty' to ensure all veterans have a fighting chance.

'Obviously I get slightly emotional talking about our vets because I have an emotional…,' he said, trailing off.

'I’m in there with them. These are men and women who volunteered in the face of danger.

'I mean, they knew right after 9/11 that the nation would seek justice and to protect ourselves. And some got hurt, and some of them need a lot of help. And our nation owes a huge debt of gratitude.'

He said his institute will also work with higher education officials on how to recruit and retain veterans.

'We recognize that in helping our veterans we can unleash the potential of a generation of resourceful, determined and experienced leaders,' Bush told the summit.

Jill Biden, wife of Vice President Joe Biden, also spoke at the summit which included panel discussions with former military leaders, business people and nonprofit leaders.

Jill Biden and first lady Michelle Obama founded the Joining Forces campaign to rally the country around its servicemen and servicewomen.

'Our military families have done so much for our country and each of us can do something in return,' Biden said.

Looking for answers: The George W. Bush Institute is working with Syracuse University on a study of the issues affecting veterans who have served since 9/11

One such solider is Jake Wood who served as Marine Corps squad leader in Iraq and a sniper in Afghanistan.

Back home, the Medal of Valor recipient has founded Team Rubicon, a nonprofit organization which is now working on veteran reintegration projects.

'Whether they have a job or not, there’s an opportunity for organizations like Team Rubicon, like The Mission Continues, to provide veterans with perhaps that sense of purpose, that sense of mission they had while they had the uniform on,' he told ABC News.

'The work doesn’t end when the last troop leaves Afghanistan. That’s only really when the work begins.'
