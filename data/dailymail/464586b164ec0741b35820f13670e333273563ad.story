There are more than 300 of them in New York - violent crews of dozens of 12- to 20-year-olds with names such as Very Crispy Gangsters, True Money Gang and Cash Bama Bullies.

Police say these groups, clustered around a particular block or housing project, are responsible for about 40 percent of the city's shootings, with most of that violence stemming from the smallest of disses on the street, Facebook, Twitter or Instagram.

'It's like belonging to an evil fraternity,' said Inspector Kevin Catalina, commander of the New York Police Department's gang division. 'A lot of it is driven by nothing: A dispute over a girl or a wrong look or a perceived slight.'

There are thought to be more than 300 gangs running the streets of modern-day New York, with the majority of the violence being caused by smaller teenage crews

While large gangs such as the Bloods and Crips still exist, they tend to adhere to the motto that violence is bad for business, while younger gangsters do not (file pic)

The trend of smaller, younger crews has also been seen in Chicago and Northeast cities over the last few years as police have cracked down on bigger, more traditional gangs, experts said.

While the Bloods, Crips and Latin Kings still exist, operating such money-making schemes as drug dealing, their members are usually older and understand the timeworn mantra of organized crime: violence is bad for business.

Not so for the crews, whose recklessness prompted former Police Commissioner Raymond Kelly in 2012 to launch an initiative to confront the crews dubbed Operation Crew Cut.

Investigators now focus on gathering intelligence about specific crews - understanding their activities, allegiances and feuds which they glean through traditional street policing and trolling of social media sites, cell phone photos and even recorded jailhouse calls.

Police have also stepped up arrests of the most active crew members.

In Manhattan, prosecutors set up an internal email alert system that notifies them when crew member are arrested, even on minor charges, and provides beyond-the-rap-sheet details for bail arguments.

The prosecutor might mention that the person was a suspect in another crime or had made threats on Facebook, for instance.

In a recent case in Harlem, Manhattan, District Attorney Cyrus R. Vance Jr. says a 2009 killing kindled years of vendetta attacks, including three killings and 30 shootings.

Kai believes that mos of the shootings happened because 'disrespect' show by one gang member to another (pictured: pistols on display in New York after police arrest six men for arms smuggling)

Sixty-three
 people were rounded up, and at least 62 entered guilty pleas, including
 crew members so young that one told another to "mob up" after school.

'The
 evidence was very powerful,' said Robert Anesi, who represented a 
19-year-old who pleaded guilty to attempted murder and conspiracy 
charges in the case last week. 'They had such access to social media and
 they knew who the players were.'

NYPD statistics show gang arrests are up citywide nearly 14 percent from 2013 - and more than 28 percent from two years ago.

Shooting incidents citywide are about the same as they were last year, with 282 recorded so far, and are down by nearly 23 percent from two years ago.

Still, crew-related violence persists despite record dips in overall crime in New York City over the last few years.

The most notable recent case came in March when investigators say a 14-year-old member of the Stack Money Goons shot a .357 revolver at a rival member of the Twan Family on a crowded bus in Brooklyn.

The bullet instead killed an immigrant father who was working two jobs to support his family.

'When you ask young adults, "Why? Why did you shoot that young man?" Probably 80 percent of the time the answer is: He disrespected me,' said Kai Smith, an ex-con-turned-businessman who runs a gang-diversion program in city high schools.

Smith works with students who have been arrested at least once, forcing them to define what disrespect means through exercises and role-playing.

In the 1800s, before prohibition and the Mafia, gangs were still rife in the city. The likes of the Dead Rabbits and the Plug Uglies ran the streets, lead by the likes of Bill The Butcher and Hell-Cat Maggie

This gangland violence was encapsulated in Martin Scorsese's 2002 film Gangs of New York, starring Daniel Day Lewis as Bill The Butcher, who was an actual gangster in the 1800s

Jamal Williams, 18, a high school junior, says he's been affiliated with crews and gangs since he was 9, though he's trying to turn his life around.

'A crew to me is a family,' he said. 'They are going to be there for me like my parents was never there for me.'

As more crew members are locked up, investigators are noticing a trend of crew members shifting affiliations behind bars, emerging as a sort-of hybrid gang-crew combination with diffuse connections and alliances.

'That has really complicated this universe,' Catalina said. 'We went from a traditional gang problem to a crew problem and now we're morphing back into somewhat of a traditional gang problem'

Gang culture has existed in New York for hundreds of years, from the modern-day crews, back to the dominance of the Mafia during the 1920s and prohibition, and even back to the 1800s when the likes of the Dead Rabbits and Plug Uglies roamed the streets.

These criminals were captured in Martin Scorsese's 2002 film Gangs of New York, a part-historical film that was based on the histories of this criminal underworld.

The film's anti-hero, Bill The Butcher, was a genuine gangster in the city in the 19th-century, named William Poole, and contested his territory with the likes of 'Dandy' Johnny Dolan and Hell-Cat Maggie.
