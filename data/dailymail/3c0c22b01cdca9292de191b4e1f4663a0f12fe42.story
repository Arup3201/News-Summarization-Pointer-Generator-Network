The Euro 2012 football tournament will have its very own version of the vuvuzela - a cuckoo whistle made out of clay.

The rustic zozulica will be a stark contrast to the brightly coloured 3ft long plastic trumpets that blighted the South African football World Cup two years ago.

Instead of emitting an ear-piercing foghorn screech that led to streams of complaints and forced TV viewers to tune out, fans say the 'zozu' will 'harmonise space and sacral unity'

Rustic: The zozulica will be a stark contrast to the brightly coloured 3ft long plastic trumpets that blighted the South African football World Cup two years ago

What a difference: The zozulica is a marked change to the vuvuzela, seen here being played by a German fan (left) and a supporter of current World and European Champions Spain (right)

While not endorsed by host countries Ukraine and Poland, it has become a firm favourite among both sets of home fans who want to make it the unofficial symbol of the championship.

Ukranian potter Lesya Denisenko-Eryomento said: 'The clay for the original zozulica comes from the soil.

'Our countries are friendly – every person coming here for the 2012 Cup will feel it. And the zozulica will transfer the positive emotions of our lands to every fan that uses one.'

Available for £3.50, a cheaper plastic version of the 7,000-year-old instrument - which potters say is 'extremely easy to play' - will also be on sale when the tournament kicks off on June 8.

The deafening sound of the vuvuzela is etched in many a football fan's mind as the over-riding memory of the South African World Cup.

The controversial £2 trumpet produced an uncomfortable 127-decibels, providing a deafening background to the entire tournament.

Louder than a chainsaw, noisier than a lawnmower and even more ear-splitting than a referee’s whistle – experts said it could damage fans' hearing in as little as 15 minutes.

Their hum, which drowned out commentary on television coverage and made viewers feel they were in a room full of angry bees, led to the BBC cutting out the sound.

The instrument also injured Cape Town insurance saleswoman Yvonne Mayer, 29, who ripped her windpipe after she blew it during a street party.

She was unable to speak or eat for two days and was ordered to rest completely to allow it to heal.
