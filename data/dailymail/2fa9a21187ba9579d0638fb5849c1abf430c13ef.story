Three kids were seen clinging to the back of a subway car departing a station on Monday evening about 100 blocks south of where a woman fell to her death on train tracks earlier in the day.

The children were on the back of an uptown express train leaving the 96th Street station on the Upper West Side at about 6pm.

It may have been a 2, 3 or 5 train.

A concerned commuter snapped a photo of the kids and sent it to the West Side Rag. 

Lorraine Ogarro, 54, was killed by a subway train

MTA official Kevin Ortiz was shown the photo, PIX 11 reported. 

After seeing it, he said: 'Stupidity knows no bounds.' 

Earlier in the day, a woman who was trying to go between subway cars was hit by a train after she slipped and fell to the tracks below. 

Lorraine Ogarro of the Bronx was on a 1 train headed downtown when she fell off near the 207 Street station in Inwood around 10.30am, according to the New York Post. 

The 54-year-old was pronounced dead at the scene.

It is illegal to move between cars except in the case of an emergency. 

Ortiz said: 'Sadly, yesterday's incident provides a clear example of why riding between subway cars is dangerous and why it is prohibited.' 

Seven people have been struck and killed by subway trains so far this year, compared to 58 in 2014.
