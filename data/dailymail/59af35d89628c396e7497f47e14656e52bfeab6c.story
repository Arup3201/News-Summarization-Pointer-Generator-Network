Young Roma women, provocatively dressed, gyrate sensuously to the sounds of Gypsy pop, trying to catch the eye of young men clad in muscle shirts and leather jackets.

With the austere, car boot sale-like surroundings and the downmarket nightclub dress code, it's no wonder the event they are taking part in has been locally dubbed the 'bridal market'.

Love is not exactly for sale in this poverty-stricken corner of Bulgaria. But amid the flirtation in the litter-strewn car park venue, families are weighing their finances against the merits of prospective brides.

These Roma, who are among the most 
poverty-stricken people in a deeply impoverished region, are seeking to 
forge mutually beneficial unions that will help them weather Bulgaria's 
brutal economic downturn.

Globalisation
has added to their precarious economic position. The families gathered 
here are part of a community of about 18,000 Roma known as Kalaidzhi, 
who traditionally make a living as coppersmiths.

Now
that historic trade is dying out, in part because traditional copper 
pots and pans are being replaced by less expensive goods from the 
ever-smoking factories of Communist China.

Nevertheless, at the bridal fair a festival atmosphere hangs in the air.

Even those girls still too young to be considered for marriage wear gobs of mascara, flashy jewellery and towering heels.

Their
mini-dresses are electric pink, blood red or canary yellow. The boys 
wear tight black jeans and muscle shirts, often topped with a black 
leather jacket.

Despite the
bleak surroundings, some 2,000 people have shown up in high spirits, 
many in cars rigged with speakers on the hoods to pump out Gypsy pop at 
full blast.

Boys and girls dance side-by-side on the cars, shaking their hips in a frenzy of barely repressed sexuality.

The
exuberance stems largely from the fact that, due to the community's 
conservative values, youths are rarely allowed to mingle with the 
opposite sex.

Tradition: Talk of brides being sold angers the Kalaidzhi. They say the marriage fair is a tradition that actually works, keeping communities and extended families intact for generations.

Kalaidzhi, 
who are almost all devout Orthodox Christians, are known to remove girls
from school at 15 or even earlier to keep them safe from temptation.

Donka Hristova is one of the young women to travel to the fair with her family, in the hope of snaring a suitable suitor.

Dressed in a skintight mini-dress, 
with her make-up dilligently applied, she joins her sisters in a 
provocative dance - hoping to look her best for the many boys also in 
attendance.

At 19, Donka is prime marrying age. 'I
hope to meet new people and to see the parents of the boys, so our 
parents can meet him,' she says. 'It's a good tradition. It's easier for
us if our parents approve.'

It starts, like a high school dance, 
with groups of boys and girls in separate clumps, occasionally shaking 
hands and checking each other out - while mothers and fathers stay 
discreetly in the background.

Apart from these twice-a-year bridal 
fairs, boys and girls only have contact in Internet chats. So Donka is 
happy to leave the realm of Facebook and meet real young men.

At the fair, there is no shortage of 
youths held in thrall by the way she dances with her sisters, who also 
wear their showiest clothes.

'I want to find someone who is easy to get along with,' she says, taking a pause from dancing in high-heeled sandals.

'Someone whose parents won't interfere after we are together, and someone who's not too rich and not too poor and has a job.'

The event's reputation as a 'bridal 
market' goes back generations. It used to take place in a muddy open 
field next to a horse-trading market in a small village, where 
brides-to-be stood on stage with suitors competing for their hand.

Those
days are over. Police this year moved it into a city to avoid tension 
with the horse traders. Still, the flirtations can lead to negotiations 
and a possible union a few months down the road.

If
the youths warm to each other, the fair can trigger complex financial 
negotiations about the price a young man's family must pay to a woman's 
parents if they are to be married.

The
cost of a bride - between 5,000 and 10,000 lev (£2,200 to £4,300) - has
dropped in recent years as jobs have dried up. And wedding festivities 
are much more modest with cash so tight.

But
prices still rise for a 'very beautiful' young woman with many suitors,
said Velcho Krastev, who has written extensively about the Kalaidzhi.

Some
say this is an innocent payment for the cost of a wedding dress and the
elaborate wedding feasts of Roma tradition. Others say it's the price 
families are willing to pay for their sons to have a woman believed to 
be a virgin.

'We are 
maintaining the morals of the children by marrying them off at a young 
age,' said Kosta Kostov, a spectator at the fair. 'If she's not a 
virgin, the bride's family has to give the money back.'

He
said Bulgaria's crushing financial slowdown, and the near total 
collapse of the coppersmith industry, has made it virtually impossible 
for his family to raise the money needed to find wives for his three 
grandsons, aged 18, 20 and 22.

'They have no jobs and their parents can't pay money to the bride's family,' he said. 'It's a crisis now.'

Negotiations: The Kalaidzhi, unlike other Roma communities, do not allow girls to marry at an extremely young age - most are 18 or older - giving virginity an even higher premium

Although the idea that a young woman 
must be a virgin when she marries has generally faded in many segments 
of Bulgarian society, it remains strong among the Roma, particularly 
those who follow Orthodox teachings.

The
Kalaidzhi, unlike other Roma communities, do not allow girls to marry 
at an extremely young age - most are 18 or older - giving virginity an 
even higher premium.

But they have started to modernise. It is now widely recognized that the young people need to have feelings for each other.

'That
is the first and most important step now,' said Mr Krastev, a member of
the Bulgarian Academy of Sciences. 'In the past, parents didn't ask the
young people whether they liked each other.

'But
the second step is that when they have decided they like each other and
the parents agree, they start negotiating what the price will be for 
the bride.'

Talk
of brides being sold angers the Kalaidzhi, who represent a small 
proportion of Bulgaria's 700,000 Roma. They say the marriage fair is a 
tradition that actually works, keeping communities and extended families
intact for generations.

Indeed,
it is easy to find men and women in their late 30s and early 40s who 
met at a bridal fair two decades ago and today are hoping now to make 
matches for their children.

Many who found a mate here five or six years ago come back to help their younger siblings or cousins get hitched.

Pepa
Georgieva married her husband Kolyo in 2008 after a courtship sparked 
at the bridal fair. She came to this year's event to help her 
20-year-old cousin navigate the sea of suitors.

'She
is nervous and there are several grooms possible,' Georgieva said. 'She
has not decided, and she can't decide by herself. We are asking her 
opinion but she also has to recognize our opinion.'

That opinion doesn't hinge on the groom alone.

'I am here to meet the families,' she said. 'To see if they have the wealth to support the bride.'
