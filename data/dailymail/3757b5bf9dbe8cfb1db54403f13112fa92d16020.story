The Olympics have already given a £10billion boost to the British economy, ministers claimed yesterday.

In a glossy 70-page brochure, ministers put the trade boom from the Games slightly higher than the cost of staging them last summer.

But the figures were immediately met with scepticism as the report directly linked the Olympics effect to building projects that included a shopping  centre in Croydon, South London.

Boom: As the anniversary of the Opening Ceremony approaches, the government claims the London 2012 Games brought a £9.9billion boost to the UK economy

Anniversary: One year on from London 2012 a 30,000-strong crowd enjoyed a day in the sun at the Go Local concert at London's Olympic Park

Business Secretary Vince Cable conceded 
the figure was ‘not a rigorous academic approach’ and some of the 
investment ‘would have happened anyway’.

But he said London 2012 had been a 
catalyst for foreign investment into the UK and made projects progress 
more quickly than they  otherwise would have.

In a report from the Government and 
the Mayor of London, it was claimed that the Games had already generated
£9.9billion for the economy, exceeding their £9.3billion cost.

This includes £2.5billion in projects
such as the development of South London’s Battersea Power Station 
backed by Malaysia, a Chinese-funded regeneration of London’s Royal 
Albert Docks, and the forthcoming Westfield shopping centre in Croydon.

Prime Minister David travelled to the Olympic Park to hand out goody bags to Olympic Games Makers who were there to celebrate one year on from the Olympic and Paralympic Games

Mr Cameron joined London Mayor Boris Johnson to see construction work which is transforming the site into the Queen Elizabeth Olympic park which will be open later this month

The Australian firm – which already 
has two Westfield centres in London, including one next to the Olympic 
Stadium in Stratford – signed a £1billion deal in January to revamp an 
existing shopping centre in Croydon, after being in talks since 2011.

The rest is made up of £5.9billion of
additional sales and overseas sports contracts awarded to British firms
for events such as the 2014 World Cup and 2016 Olympics, both in 
Brazil.

By 2020, the Games could add £41billion of value to the economy, the report says.

Mr Cable, speaking on BBC Radio 4’s Today programme, said: ‘Would this have happened anyway?

Some of these activities clearly would, but the Olympics were a key catalyst in making those investment decisions real.’

Contracts: The report suggests that since the Olympic Park closed last summer British companies have gone on to win contracts for the Olympic and Paralympic Games in Rio

Rebuilding: Construction workers have been on site since the closing ceremony preparing the venues to be reopened to the public

But Labour’s Lord Harris, chairman of
Parliament’s Olympic and Paralympic Legacy Committee, said: ‘I’m afraid
you have to take all of these figures with a large pinch of salt.’

Mr Cable said: ‘The answer we’ve had 
with a lot of the high-profile investment is that a lot of the key 
negotiations [with investors] came out of the events that we organised 
around the Olympics.

An enormous amount of effort was put 
in to try to attract big inward investment, to try to support British 
businesses to get business on the back of it.’

During the Games, lavish  hospitality
was extended to  foreign dignitaries and business leaders at the 
British Business Embassy in Lancaster House in London, in the hope of 
attracting a trade windfall.

David Cameron yesterday said: ‘This 
£9.9billion boost to the UK economy is a reminder to the world that, if 
you want the best, if you want professionalism, if you want jobs done on
time  and on budget, then you should think British.’

Claiming credit: Business Secretary Vince Cable admitted some of the investment would have happened anyway while London Mayor Boris Johnson claimed a new shopping centre in Croydon could be attributed to the Olympics

Doing deals: David Cameron used the Games to meet business and political leaders in London, including Russian President Vladimir Putin at a judo event
