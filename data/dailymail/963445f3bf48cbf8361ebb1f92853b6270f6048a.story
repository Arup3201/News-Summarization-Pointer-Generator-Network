Luis Suarez's alleged bite on Giorgio Chiellini during Uruguay's win over Italy will cast a cloud over the rest of the striker's career, according to Paul Scholes.

Suarez was embroiled in a third biting incident of his career in 
Uruguay's 1-0 win against Italy, after clashing with defender Chiellini 
before Diego Godin scored the only goal of the game.

The former Manchester United midfielder told Paddy Power that Suarez should receive a lengthy ban for his actions, as his 10-match ban for biting Branislav Ivanovic was not enough.

'He will feel terrible tonight, and the entire incident is such a shame because he’s a tremendous player.

'But people will remember Suarez now for his biting antics at this World Cup rather than his supreme footballing ability.

'Banning him for the rest of the World Cup is not enough, because Colombia will beat Uruguay in their next game anyway.'
