President Barack Obama spent Martin Luther King Day alongside his family honoring the civil rights leader by helping a soup kitchen prepare its daily meals as Americans and their leaders nationwide celebrated King's legacy.

The president, first lady, and daughters Malia and Sasha joined an assembly line at DC Central Kitchen where they helped stuff burritos. Obama said he came to help the facility mark its 25th anniversary on Monday.

Elsewhere in Washington and across America, people remembered the assassinated leader by marching in the streets, convening at churches and attending speeches in recognition of a man whose powerful messages about poverty, violence and voting right continue to resonate with people today.

Among those joining Obama was senior adviser Valerie Jarrett.

DC Central Kitchen prepares thousands of meals every day for distribution to local shelters.

Vice President Joe Biden appeared at the National Action Network's annual Martin Luther King Jr. breakfast, and later joined the Catholic Volunteer Network in serving a hot lunch to guests at SOME - So Others Might Eat.

In his honor: MLK Day became a U.S. federal holiday commemorating the civil rights pioneer's January 15 birthday. In 2014, King would have turned 85 years old and festivities, marches, and speeches honored the occasion nationwide on Monday

Several of Obama's Cabinet officers, including Treasury Secretary Jacob Lew, Education Secretary Arne Duncan, Commerce Secretary Penny Pritzker and Veterans Affairs Secretary Eric Shinseki, as well as White House chief of staff Denis McDonough, also took part in various holiday-related events.

Hundreds of people filled Ebenezer 
Baptist Church in Atlanta on Monday to remember and reflect on the 
legacy of the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr., one of many events to honor 
the slain civil rights leader.

The
 service at Ebenezer featured prayers, songs, music and speakers. Across
 the country, there were also speeches, parades, marches and community 
service projects to honor King, an Atlanta native.

About
 50 years ago today, King had just appeared on the cover of Time 
magazine as its Man of the Year, and the nation was on the cusp of 
passing the Civil Rights Act of 1964.

Georgia
 Governor Nathan Deal said there were not many states that can boast a 
native son that merits a national holiday before saying, 'but we 
Georgians can.'

Deal said 
this year he would work with state legislators to find an appropriate 
way to honor the Nobel Peace Prize winner at the Georgia Capitol, which 
drew a standing ovation from the audience. He did not give any 
specifics, but civil rights leaders have suggested a statue at the state
 Capitol.

'I think that more than just saying kind thoughts about him we ought to take action ourselves,' said Deal, a Republican. 'That's how we embed truth into our words. I think it's time for Georgia's leaders to follow in Dr. King's footsteps and take action, too.'

Deal also touched on criminal justice reforms his administration has tried to make, including drug and mental health courts and community-based services to keep non-violent criminals and young people out of prison.

Vice President Joe Biden addressed the National Action Network's MLK Breakfast, urging them to protect voting rights.

'Let me remind you all, it all rests ultimately on the ballot box, so keep the faith, or as my grandmom would say, `No, Joey, go spread the faith.' It's time to spread it,' Biden said.

New York City's new Mayor Bill de Blasio marked the day by talking about economic inequality, saying it was 'closing doors for hard-working people in this city and all over this country.'

'We have a city sadly divided between those with opportunity, with the means to fully partake of that opportunity, and those whose dreams of a better life are being deferred again and again,' he told an audience at the Brooklyn Academy of Music.

In Ann Arbor, Mich., activist and entertainer Harry Belafonte planned to deliver the keynote address for the 28th annual Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. Symposium at the University of Michigan's Hill Auditorium.

Arthur Goff, 38, of Frederick, 
Maryland, visited the King Memorial in Washington with his mother, his 
son, his sister and her children.

Goff's
 mother, 68-year-old Loretta Goff, said she was in nursing school in New
 York when King died in 1968 and remembers it being a traumatic time. 
Now, she said, everyone is responsible for continuing King's legacy.

'There is still so much more to do,' she said.

In memoriam: Roses lie in front of the crypt of Martin Luther King, Jr., and his wife Coretta Scott King at the King Center on the national holiday in King's honor in Atlanta, Georgia

In Memphis, Tennessee, where King was assassinated, an audio recording of an interview with King was played at the National Civil Rights Museum. The recording sheds new light on a phone call President John F. Kennedy made to King's wife more than 50 years ago.

Historians generally agree Kennedy's 
phone call to Coretta Scott King expressing concern over her husband's 
arrest in October 1960 - and Robert Kennedy's work behind the scenes to 
get King released - helped JFK win the White House.

The
 reel-to-reel audiotape was discovered by a man cleaning out his 
father's attic. The father, an insurance salesman, had interviewed King 
for a book he was writing, but never completed it and stored the 
recording with other interviews he'd done.

Americans visited the National Mall to mark the 50th anniversary of the 
March on Washington and King's I Have a Dream speech, which he gave from
 the steps of the Lincoln Memorial.

Several
 people who were scheduled to speak at that event but were cut because 
there was not enough time were invited to speak at Ebenezer.

King
 was born January 15, 1929, and he would've been 85 years old. The 
federal holiday is the third Monday in January and has been celebrated 
since 1986.
