After hunting for buried treasure for three decades – and not finding a great deal – even the most diligent of us might have given up.

But not Reg Mead and Richard Miles. The two amateur metal detectors kept up their search of the same area throughout the decades and have finally struck gold – or rather silver.

They have unearthed the largest hoard of Celtic coins ever found. Each one of the 30,000–50,000 coins is estimated to be worth around £200 each, putting the value of the haul at up to £10milion.

A coin in the hand: Archaeologists believe the hoard, found by two metal detectors, is worth about £10million

They are thought to be from the first century BC and were found buried 3ft deep under a hedge in a farmer’s field on Jersey.

Two thousand years ago the Channel 
Island – which remains a popular spot to stash large sums of money –  
was a refuge for tribes fleeing what is now northern France from the 
invading Roman armies.

As the legions of Julius Ceasar drew 
closer, the treasure is thought to have been buried by a Celtic tribe 
called the Coriosolitae, in the hope it could be dug up once the danger 
had passed.

Determined Reg Mead and Richard Miles spent decades searching a field in Jersey after hearing rumours that a farmer had discovered silver coins while working on his land

And there the coins – packed in clay and weighing a ton – have remained undisturbed until last week.

The men who discovered them, Mr Mead, 
70, and Mr Miles, a customs officer in his 40s, suspected treasure was 
in the area three decades ago, when they heard rumours a farmer had 
found some silver pieces on his land. After a series of largely 
unsuccessful forays in the area, they unearthed a stash of 120 coins in 
February.

Mr Mead, a grandfather who lives with 
wife Ruth in St Clement, Jersey, said: ‘Richard found the first one and 
it was amazing – when you see him raising his hand above his head 
(saying) “got one”.’

The pair used a powerful metal 
detector known as a deepseeker to search for more treasure in the field 
and struck lucky last week.

Richard Miles and Reg Mead first stumbled across a find of 60 silver and one gold coin - believed to be part of the same haul - back in February this year

‘The machine picked up a really strong
 signal – so we immediately got in touch with professional 
archaeologists,’ Mr Mead said. ‘They started digging and we could not 
believe how many coins there were.

‘All of them were stuck together. I 
have been searching for things like this since 1959 and never found 
anything on this scale before.

‘We had been searching that land for 30 years.’

After four days of careful digging the
 hoard was hauled to the surface by crane. It will now be subject of an 
inquest to determine ownership rights.

Mr Mead added: ‘I am absolutely numb 
at the moment. To find one haul of coins in a lifetime is rare, but to 
find two is just unheard of.’

The location of the find is being kept secret.

Neil Mahrer of Jersey Heritage Museum,
 who helped to excavate the money, said: ‘This is the biggest Celtic 
coin hoard ever found which is tremendously exciting.’

The previous record find was in 1935 at La Marquanderie in Jersey when more than 11,000 were discovered.

Mr Mahrer added that the coins, which are called staters and quarter staters, weigh as much as a 50p piece.

‘All the coins are silver and a common
 theme is a picture of a man or god’s head on one side of the coin and a
 horse on the other,’ he said. ‘They are covered in green corrosion 
because the silver is mixed with copper and copper corrodes. But they 
should come up again in a good condition.’

Dr Philip de Jersey, a former Celtic 
coin expert at Oxford University, said: ‘The find is very significant. 
It will add a huge amount of new information, not just about the coins 
themselves, but the people who were using them.’

Dated around 50BC, it's believed the coins were buried underground to be kept safe from Julius Caesar's campaigns (pictured)

The
 first century BC was a time of turmoil for the Iron Age settlements 
being forced to the edge of Europe by the advancing Roman armies.

As 
Julius Caesar’s troops thrust towards northern Gaul, the Coriosolitae - 
the Celtic tribe that buried the coin hoard in Jersey - were being 
forced out of their home territory.
    Gaul - which covered modern day France and parts of surrounding countries - finally fell to the Romans in 51 BC.

Its 
northern section, known to the Romans as Armorica but covering present 
day Brittany and Normandy, had close links to southern Britain.

Julius Caesar observed that armies from Britannia were often to be fighting in alliance with tribes from Gaul against his men.

Home for
 the Celts was typically a roundhouse with thatched roofs of straw or 
heather and walls of wattle and daub when timber was plentiful.

Porridge, beer and bread made from rye and barley were commonly eaten and drunk from vessels made of horn.

The 
image of long-haired, moustachioed Celts depicted in the cartoon tales 
of Asterix and Obelix actually has a basis in historical records.
    Classical texts mention that both Celtic men and women had long hair, with the men sporting beards or moustaches.

One 
Roman, Diodorus Siculus, wrote: ‘When they are eating the moustache 
becomes entangled in the food, and when they are drinking the drink 
passes, as it were, through a sort of strainer’.
    With Christianity not coming to 
northern Europe until the 6th century AD, the Celts worshipped a variety
 of pagan Gods and practised polygamy.

Important
 religious festivals included Beltane, May 1, the beginning of the warm 
season, and Lugnasad, August 1, celebrating the ripening of the crops.

Other 
feasts included Imbolc, February 1, when sheep begin to lactate, and 
Samhain, November 1, a festival when spirits could pass between the 
worlds, thought to have carried on in the tradition of Halloween.

As for 
leisure activities for both the young and old, glass gaming pieces have 
been found in later Iron Age burials, suggesting the Celts played board 
games. 

Children may have occupied their free time by practising their skill at the slingshot - a common Iron Age weapon.
