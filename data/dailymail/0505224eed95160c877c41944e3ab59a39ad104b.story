So the Americans have finally done 
what the British intelligence services, police, courts and successive 
governments failed to do in 15 years — they’ve incarcerated Abu Hamza 
for good.

You can draw a 
direct line from Britain’s failure to act in the late Nineties, when he 
first came to the attention of the authorities, through to 52 deaths and
 more than 700 injuries in the London bombings in 2005.

In
 addition, hundreds of young British Muslims have been lured to their 
deaths in Afghanistan, Iraq, Libya and Syria by the warped, poisonous 
rhetoric of Hamza and others, who used London as a safe haven in which 
to preach, recruit and raise money.

Guilty verdict: Hate preacher Abu Hamza, 56, who was extradited from the UK in 2012, was found guilty of terrorism offences in New York

It’s a shameful catalogue of 
inefficient policing, political blindness, legal weakness and limited 
intelligence — in every sense of that phrase.

Our security services appeared neither sharp enough to see what was going on nor willing to share what little they did glean. 

Why
 on earth didn’t the police and intelligence agents simply open their 
ears and eyes to what was happening all over this country?

They
 could have attended Hamza’s public meetings, bought his audio cassettes
 from Islamic bookshops, spoken to worried families of his followers and
 listened to the warnings of intelligence services in Europe and 
America.

How do I know? Because that’s what I did. As an investigative reporter, I’ve tracked Hamza’s ‘career’ since the late Nineties.

Yesterday,
 political and legal figures were defending their failure to get an 
earlier result. For example, Lord Goldsmith, Attorney General from 2001 
to 2007, said it didn’t matter whether Hamza had been convicted in New 
York or London.

But how many lives would have been saved — how many families spared the anguish of bereavement — if our Government had acted more decisively?

It will remain a damning indictment of the police, politicians and the judicial authorities that they did not react sooner.

Even as far back as 1998, when I filmed Hamza spouting his rhetoric at an ‘Islamic Revival Meeting’ in London, it was clear this man was radicalising potential terrorists and should have been arrested or deported.

That meeting took place, ironically, in the Friends Meeting House owned by the Quaker movement, which is committed to peace and inclusive faith. However, not much of either was on show that night.

The extremist cleric felt secure enough to unveil a plan ‘to make the skies very high risk for anyone who flies’.

His bizarre scheme — three years before terrorists hijacked planes on 9/11 — involved giant floating nets, mined with explosives, which, somehow, would entangle passing planes. The 500-strong audience cheered wildly and shouted ‘Allahu Akbar’ — (God is Great).

Then he urged his followers to devise other similar schemes, before showing gruesome videos of rebel ‘martyrs’ in Chechnya, Palestine and Bosnia.

The same torrent of hatred came through in his speeches, which were available on cassette from bookshops in towns such as Burnley and Blackburn.

In one inflammatory speech, the audience was told: ‘Get training, it’s so you can get the infidel and crush his head in your arms, wring his throat, whip his intestines out.

‘Forget wasting a bullet on them, cut them in half. If you can put a balaclava on your face and walk down the road and stick one in someone, then do it. As long as you’re going to get away with it.’

For several years, intelligence contacts in Europe told me they were furious at the British Government’s lack of action against Hamza.

Although they knew that our security services had paid informers inside Finsbury Park mosque, in North London, which Hamza had turned into his own personal fiefdom, the information gathered wasn’t passed to Special Branch, let alone shared with other countries’ intelligence services.

This was a crucial failure, because by the late-Nineties, extremist Islam had become a global phenomenon. Cities such as London, Paris and New York were all at risk from terrorism.

Yet London was allowed to become a base for international terrorism — with Al Qaeda followers living in suburbs right across the capital.

Among these was a Saudi who was Osama Bin Laden’s ‘representative’ and the leader of an Algerian terror group that was responsible for horrific atrocities in that country but which was allowed to operate in Britain unhindered.

Radical cleric Omar Bakri’s extremist Al-Muhajiroun movement, which was banned in several Arab countries and which stirred up violence on many British campuses, was also based in London until eventually outlawed in 2010. 

Meanwhile, firebrand Abu Qatada was allowed to remain in Britain — despite ten years of protracted legal hearings — until finally being deported back to his native Jordan last summer.

In the official report into the London bombings of July 2005, the police admitted ‘they’d been working to the wrong script’, unaware of the dangers of home-grown terrorism.

Shortly after those attacks, I interviewed Dame Pauline Neville-Jones, who had been political director at the Foreign Office in the mid-Nineties. She said that an increasing number of other countries’ governments had complained to Britain about people they considered dangerous who had been allowed to live in London.

She said: ‘We’d say to the Home Office: “This is becoming a bit bumpy.” I think the Home Office view was: “Well, they’re not breaking the law and we can’t send them home because they’d be in jeopardy.” In effect, they weren’t willing to act to curb them.’  

Not surprisingly, the American government was furious.

Three years earlier, I met FBI officials, desperate to prosecute Hamza in the U.S.

They couldn’t understand why our Government hadn’t done so, despite clear links between him and British citizens who had been killed in terrorist attacks.

Specifically, this referred to an incident in 1999, when a group of Hamza’s followers, including his son and stepson, were arrested in Yemen.

Their Yemeni associates took a group of 16 foreign tourists in reprisal. The gang leader’s official spokesman was Hamza.

He was aware of what was happening — the result of which was a botched Yemeni rescue operation which led to a shoot-out in which three British tourists died.

‘Why is Hamza still walking your streets?’ an FBI agent asked me. On his suggestion, I looked at court files in Seattle which revealed how utterly inept the British police operation had been.

There, I found a memo from Special Branch officers at Heathrow Airport.

Although not public knowledge in the UK, it was freely available in America. It described how, in 2001, just before 9/11, a known associate of Hamza’s called Ujaama was stopped while attempting to travel to Afghanistan with cash and computer equipment.

Ujaama claimed it was for a girls’ educational charity.

Could this really be true at a time when Afghanistan was controlled by the Taliban, who refused to allow girls to be educated?

The FBI agent later testified that British security contacts told him they were convinced that the money and equipment came from Hamza and was being sent to fund the Taliban.

So, why was Hamza’s courier not arrested — and Hamza himself questioned? Instead, the memo in Seattle reveals that ‘all efforts’ were made to help Ujaama continue his journey.

It was only the following year when Hamza’s courier made another trip, this time to the U.S. — but again on the radical cleric’s behalf — where he hoped to find a suitably remote site for a training camp, that he was arrested.

Of course, this arrest was made by the now very impatient Americans.

In return for a reduced jail sentence, Ujaama testified against Hamza.

Another of Hamza’s British followers, Saajid Badat, who was arrested and admitted plotting to blow up a passenger plane in mid-air with a bomb hidden in his shoe, also gave evidence against him.

Along with emotional testimony from a survivor of the Yemeni shoot-out, it was enough to convict Hamza.  Now, the cleric is facing life imprisonment. And it was all the result of evidence that could have been available to the UK authorities.

The U.S. prosecutor referred to Hamza as ‘hiding in plain sight’ in London.

It is said that ‘justice is blind’ — a metaphor meaning the law is impartial, oblivious to race or religion. But from what I’ve seen, it’s a literal description of Britain’s response to Abu Hamza.
