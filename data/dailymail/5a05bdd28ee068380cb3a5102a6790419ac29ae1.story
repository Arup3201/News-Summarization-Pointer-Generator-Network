A serial bigamist posed as her seventh 'husband' in order to get prescription drugs to feed her addiction to sedatives and painkillers.

After being refused drugs by a doctor in Ilchester, Somerset, Emily Horne, 33, dressed up as a man and told medics she was her husband, Craig Hadwin, serving in the Navy at RNAS Yeovilton, Somerset.

She had 'married' him earlier this year in a bogus ceremony in Scotland before using his name to dupe doctors into giving her sleeping pills.

Sean Cunningham, before he found out about her bigamy. Simon Thorpe,

married two men during their two-year engagement

Prosecutor Gordon Richings said: 'She
 said he was in the navy and based at nearby RNAS Yeovilton and the sick
 bay was closed but the defendant attended the appointment herself 
purporting to be Craig Hadwin.

'She was wearing trousers and a baggy
 football shirt and had extremely short cropped hair but the doctor was 
taken in and prescribed her two sleeping pills.'

Yeovil Magistrates' Court was told 
that Horne changed her name by deed poll to Max Accastes Quiberberon and
 used various aliases including Accates Hadwin and Cassy Hadwin to feed 
her addiction, according to the Daily Mirror.

Horne, who worked as a glamour model and appeared on X-rated films, will be sentenced for two counts of fraud to obtain prescription drugs next month

She
 contacted the NHS's out-of-hours service in May telling them she had 
been the victim of an assault and was prescribed diazepam and codeine 
phosphate.

Then on July 11 
she used the name Cassy Hadwin to get co-codamol painkillers from 
casualty at Musgrove Park Hospital after saying she had fallen over and 
hurt her wrist.

Horne 
admitted all the allegations when she was questioned by police on 
November 13 and asked for three similar offences to be taken into 
consideration when she appeared in court for two offences of fraud to 
obtain prescription drugs.

She will appear for sentencing at 
Taunton Crown Court on January 20 when a suspended sentence handed to 
her in Manchester in 2009 could also be activated.

Horne's web of lies started soon after she married her first husband, Paul Rigby, in 1996 when she was 18.

They split up after three months, however, and three years later she wed Sean Cunningham.

Their relationship ended after a couple of months and she left him for his friend, Simon Thorpe - the man who had given her away at her wedding to Mr Cunningham.

While Horne and Thorpe were engaged she married another two men, Chris Barrett, who she met on a bus, and James Matthews, who she met on a train where he worked as a conductor.

It was at this time that Horne started working as a glamour model, appearing in X-rated films.

When Horne refused to return to Matthews after walking out on him to live with one of his friends, he contacted police.

She was jailed for bigamy in 2004 but three years after her release Ashley Baker fell under her spell.

Husbands four and five: James Matthews, left, 
and Ashley Baker, right, both fell under Horne's spell and both found 
out she was still married soon after their own weddings to her

He
 stood by her for another 10 months despite her honeymoon confession 
that he was husband number five after she lied, telling him she had 
cancer.

Last year she met IT worker Stuart 
Allen from Burnley and he soon became 'smitten' with the brunette who 
introduced herself as Max.

She
 agreed to marry him, but when she went away for a few days to visit her
 father, he learned she had actually gone to the U.S. to marry policeman
 Fred Miller who she had met online.

After
 just a few days into her honeymoon with husband number six, their 
marriage fell apart and Horne returned to England to live on benefits in
 Wareham, Dorset.

Earlier this year she married her seventh husband, Mr Hadwin, at a ceremony in Scotland after meeting him on a dating website.
