A man accused of  holding a woman captive for two months and repeatedly raping her casually told his girlfriend's ex-husband, 'I've got a girl back here in a cage', the man has claimed.

Ron Higgs, 61, was dumbfounded when he went to the Mount Vernon, Indiana trailer where Ricky House Jr., 37, and Kendra Tooley, 44, lived and saw their alleged slave, Joelle Lockwood.

Lockwood, 30, who was forced to wear a collar and sleep in the cage, begged Higgs to help her escape and he managed to get her out of the home as House allegedly pointed a gun at him.

After he drove Lockwood, who had been reported missing on July 9, back to his home last Friday, he immediately contacted authorities and the couple was promptly arrested.

Nonchalant: Ricky Roy House Jr. is guided outside court following his not-guilty plea on Monday. He and his girlfriend are accused of keeping a 30-year-old woman captive in their home for two months

Emotional: His girlfriend Kendra Tooley, 44, hid her face as she was escorted out of court on Monday

'My hat's off to him,' Posey County Sheriff Greg Oeth told TSHP about Higgs, who had been invited to the home because Tooley said they wanted to borrow money from him.

'I'm glad he did what he did. I'm glad he was in the situation he was and I'm glad he was able to get her out of that residence and get her back to the safety of her family.'

On Monday, House and Tooley appeared in court wearing orange and white striped jumpsuits and bulletproof vests and pleaded not guilty to multiple charges.

House was charged with four counts of rape, one count of conspiracy to commit rape, five counts of criminal confinement, two counts of kidnapping, one count of battery resulting in bodily injury and one count of pointing a firearm.

Tooley was charged with two counts of rape, one count of conspiracy to commit rape, four counts of criminal confinement, two counts of kidnapping and one count of conspiracy to commit criminal confinement. 

Found: Joelle Lockwood, 30, vanished as she left a party on July 9 and on Friday, she was freed from the trailer where she had been held captive. She said she had been forced to stay inside a cage

She covered her face and sobbed in the courtroom, while House showed little emotion, TSHP reported. Both are due back in court on October 1.

Lockwood has since revealed terrifying details of her confinement during the two months her family were frantically searching for her.

In July, she was drunk and walking back from a party when House, with whom she'd been at high school, offered to give her a ride. She went back to his trailer on his suggestion. 

But when there, he held her captive and bound her in several places, including 'an intricate restraint system attached to the bed', she told authorities. 

She said she was raped repeated while House used restraints, and authorities found ties including bungee cords and zip ties in the home, TSHP reported.

At the home, she was also allegedly let out of the cage to perform chores while wearing a belt like a dog collar around her neck and naked from the waist down.

According to police, Tooley has admitted to police that Lockwood was abducted and held, but House has so far refused to cooperate with authorities.

Higgs said that he was telephoned by Tooley on Thursday because she needed money from him. 

Captivity: The victim was allegedly kept in this wooden cage at the couple's Indiana trailer

Locked up: Kendra Tooley and Ricky Roy House Jr. now face charges of confinement and rape

He said that when he arrived at the couple's trailer, House showed him Lockwood inside the cage.

'She had a t-shirt on, and that was it,' said Higgs to WFIE. 'She had a leather belt, like a dog collar on. Every night, they locked her in there. No food, no water.'

Higg said that she was being made to cook and clean by House and Tooley and he initially thought she had agreed to the bizarre set-up.

But on Friday, his second night in the trailer, Lockwood approached him and begged for help.

'That's when she told me on the second night with tears running down her eyes, 'please, do not leave here with out me,' said Higgs. 'And I promised her, if I have to give my life to get you out of here I will.'

He then managed to get Lockwood out of the trailer, allegedly with guns trained on him, although Higgs has not clarified how he got the mother of two out as of Sunday.

'Everybody's calling me a hero,' said Higgs. 'I'm just a pure bred American, that I believe.' 

Joelle's mother, Candace said on Sunday that she is thrilled and exhausted to have her daughter home, while family friend, Amanda Crowe said that the family is still in shock.

'I just really want to say thank you to everyone who has supported us and has supported Joelle's family,' said Crowe. 'It means the world to all of us that the community has come out and has helped to find her.' 

Lockwood was last seen on July 9 leaving a party in Evansville, about 20 miles away. She was walking in the area of Park Street and Florida Street in Evansville and allegedly intoxicated.

Authorities have also been exploring any possible connection between the Lockwood case and the August 15 disappearance of Kristy Kelley, 27, in Boonville, about 20 miles from Evansville, the Evansville Courier & Press reported last month.

Evansville police did not mention the Kelley case in their statement and a spokesperson could not be reached for comment on Sunday. 

A dispatcher for the Warrick County Sheriff's Office said on Sunday that Kelley was still missing.
