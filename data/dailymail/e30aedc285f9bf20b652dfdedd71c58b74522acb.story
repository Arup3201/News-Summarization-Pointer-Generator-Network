Former Miss USA Rima Fakih made an initial appearance in court today for a drink-driving charge.

The former beauty queen was accused of speeding and swerving in her car on December 3 of last year in her hometown of Highland Park, Michigan, and police found an open bottle of champagne in the back of her 2011 Jaguar. 

She was arrested when police saw her weaving in and out of traffic without using her signal.

Her blood alcohol level was more than twice the legal limit, according to police reports. 

The 26 year old initially blew a 0.19. The legal limit is 0.08.

Fakih appeared in court wearing her hair in a high ponytail, looking mild-mannered in a white pinstripe suit.

Her attorney Otis Culpepper told the Detroit Free Press that he is going to work to see Fakih’s rights are guaranteed.

He told the paper: ‘You never want to discount the possibility of negotiation, but if that does not work out to her advantage, a trial is not something we are afraid of.’

The judge set a bench trial for March 13. Fakih faces up to 93 days in prison if convicted, as well as court fees and fines.

Though she would not speak to reporters today, Fakih wrote on her Twitter account: ‘They say “expect the worse” I say “Expect the best and even better will happen.”’

Fakih was born in Lebanon and was raised in New York. In 2003, Fakih’s family moved to the Detroit suburb of Dearborn.

Making history: Rima Fakih was the first Arab-American voted Miss USA

She was crowned Miss USA in May 2010. Shortly after she was crowned, photos emerged of the beauty queen in a 2007 poll dancing competition, causing a scandal. 

Her reign ended in June of last year. She made history as the first Arab-American to ever win the title.

Her attorney said she is currently looking to become an actress.
