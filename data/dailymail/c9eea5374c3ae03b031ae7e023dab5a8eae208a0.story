The parents of a teenage girl who was run over and killed by two emergency vehicles after last summers' Asiana Airlines crash, have filed a claim against the city of San Francisco, saying rescuers were reckless and poorly trained.

The parents of 16-year-old Ye Meng Yuan say firefighters who first saw the girl after the July 6 crash should have examined her and moved her somewhere safe.

Firefighters told investigators they assumed the girl was dead and instead hurried on toward the damaged aircraft. Newly released footage shows workers walking past her body without stopping.

However, an autopsy revealed Yuan was alive before two fire vehicles hit her.

Crash landing: An aerial view of an Asiana Airlines Boeing 777 plane is seen after it crashed while landing at San Francisco International Airport in California in July

In all, 304 of the 307 people aboard 
the plane survived after the airliner slammed into a seawall at the end 
of a runway during final approach for landing.

The
 impact ripped off the back of the plane, tossed out three flight 
attendants and their seats, and scattered pieces of the jet across the 
runway as it spun and skidded to a stop.

Yuan was one of three Chinese teens who died; one died during the crash, and another later in the hospital.

In
 their claim, attorneys at the Los Angeles law firm Kreindler and 
Kreindler representing Yuan's parents name 37 specific airport, fire and
 police department employees, saying they and others 'breached their 
duty of care.' They do not specify damages.

In
 an obituary, Yuan was described as a champion athlete who excelled at 
literature, playing piano, singing and public speaking. Her given name 
means 'wish come true' in Chinese.

It
 is still unknown how Yuan got out of the plane, but the claim says she 
was possibly taken out by rescuers. Interviews for an ongoing National 
Traffic Safety Board found Yuan was covered with foam and struck twice â€”
 once by a fire rig spraying foam whose driver had seen and driven 
around her earlier in the chaos, and again 11 minutes later by a second 
truck that was turning around to fetch water.

Her
 death has prompted new training for firefighters who work at San 
Francisco International Airport, including 40 to 80 hours of advanced 
instruction at Dallas-Fort Worth International Airport.

'There
 are many lessons to be learned here,' Assistant Deputy Chief Dale 
Carnes, who oversees the San Francisco Fire Department's airport 
division, said during a NTSB hearing in December. 'We are developing 
strategies to lessen the potential for firefighting vehicles impacting 
accident victims.'

The driver of the first of two San 
Francisco Fire Department rigs that struck the girl said he was alerted 
less than 15 minutes earlier to avoid the her as she lay on the ground.

The
 footage, taken by a dashboard camera aboard the rig and reviewed 
Thursday by The San Francisco Chronicle, sheds new light on the 
circumstances surrounding the death of Ye Meng Yuan.

Several 
firefighters who responded to the July 6 crash have told investigators 
they believed Ye was dead and that they had concentrated on rescuing 
passengers and crew members who were still aboard the burning Boeing 
777.

No one has reported checking her vital signs, however.

The
 rig camera's footage shows that although the plane had crashed just a 
few minutes earlier, passengers were gone from the area where Ye lay 
crumpled, and at one point a firefighter walked past her without looking
 down.

It also shows that the first rig that ran over Ye sprayed 
much of the flame-retardant foam that came to obscure her from 
firefighter drivers.

When the rig initially pulled up to the plane, the girl was lying on bare ground, the footage shows.

The
 dashboard camera's footage showed a firefighter Roger Phillips waving 
his arms to direct the driver of a fire truck to travel around the girl.

The NTSB were later told that the firefighter assumed the girl was dead.

The
 footage shows no firefighter attempting to move Ye or mark her with a 
casualty flag, as first responders commonly do at disaster scenes.

Foam gradually covered the girl, and the fire truck went onto the plane Yee, working without a spotter, advanced on the plane.

The plane struck a seawall just short of the runway, shearing off its tail and sending the rest of the airliner sliding and turning down the runway before breaking apart and catching fire
