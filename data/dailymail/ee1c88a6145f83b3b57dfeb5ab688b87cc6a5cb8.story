Student Sarah Jane Burke, 17, was on her way home from college when David Baillie ploughed into her as she crossed the road, a court heard

A teenage girl was killed by a road rage driver who was 'acting as if he owned the road' as he carried out an aggressive overtaking manoeuvre in a 30mph street, a court heard.

Student Sarah Jane Burke, 17, was on her way home from college when David Baillie ploughed into her as she crossed the residential street, it was said.

Newcastle Crown Court heard from witnesses who said Baillie was involved in a road rage incident at the time of the collision with the driver of a Vauxhall Corsa.

The car was in front of his Volvo S60 as they travelled along a 30mph road in Sunderland, the court heard.

Witnesses said Baillie, who had a young child and a woman in the car, swerved and accelerated to get past the Corsa as talented art student Sarah was crossing the road.

Baillie, who afterwards described the teenager as 'like a rabbit in the headlights', crashed into her, throwing her into the air and she landed on her head 20 metres away.

The teenager suffered multiple injuries and died five days later in hospital from her injuries.

Baillie, who admits causing death by 
careless driving, is on trial accused of causing Sarah’s death by 
dangerous driving, which he denies.

Witnesses claim Baillie had been 
'tailgating' the other vehicle from Barnes Park Road and had hit Sarah as he tried desperately to get in front.

Prosecutors say as he overtook the other car, Baillie was focusing on the other driver alongside him, rather than the road ahead.

Prosecutor Nick Dry told jurors: 'His driving was fuelled by rage and failing to get ahead of the Corsa and thereafter he was consumed by a determination to overtake at all costs.

'This culminated in a collision which cost a 17-year-old girl her life.'

Sarah, described in court as a 'talented teenager', had been on her way home from college on September 17 last year.

She lived with her parents and sister, in Sunderland, and was crossing the city’s Ormonde Street around 5.30pm when she was hit.

Trial: David Baillie pictured outside Newcastle Crown Court. The court heard from witnesses who said Baillie was involved in a road rage incident at the time of the collision with the driver of a Vauxhall Corsa

Witnesses said Baillie, who had a young child and a woman in the car, swerved and accelerated to get past the Corsa as talented art student Sarah was crossing the road. She was flung 20 metres and landed on her head

Mr Dry said Baillie had been seen driving dangerously before the impact as he became enraged by Corsa driver Paul Potter.

Mr Dry said: 'The defendant was seen by a number of witnesses to be driving dangerously in the minutes before the fatal impact with Sarah.

'Seemingly enraged by the vehicle travelling ahead of him, he was accelerating and braking heavily as he looked to overtake.'

Mr Potter, who was taking his 12-year-old daughter to her grandmother’s, said Baillie pulled up alongside him at traffic lights, where one lane filters into two.

Mr Potter, a bus driver, pulled away but said Baillie kept accelerating very close behind him and another witness estimated he was within a foot at times.

Mr Dry said: 'Another witness put it down to road rage and noticed the defendant appeared to be very agitated.

'Throughout the episode he noticed the Corsa was driving in a steady, normal manner.'

As they travelled along Ormonde Street, Baillie overtook near a zebra crossing, it was said.

Mr
 Dry told the court: 'She reached the middle of the road when Mr Potter 
looked in his mirror to see the defendant pulling out to overtake him, 
accelerating hard to get by.

'There was a violent swerve causing the suspension to dip and the car looked out of control.”'

The teenager, who lived with her parents and sister, in Sunderland, was crossing the city's Ormonde Street around 5.30pm when she was hit

Mr Potter braked to let Baillie past but it was too late to prevent him hitting Sarah.

Jurors were shown footage which was picked up by a passing bus and showed Sarah making her way home along Ormonde Street.

A
 second set of footage, picked up by a camera on another bus, showed the
 aftermath of the tragedy while Sarah was lying on the road injured 
after she tried to cross it.

The
 court heard Baillie initially blamed the Corsa driver for causing the 
accident but went on to admit in police interview that his driving had 
been dangerous as he had been paying more attention to the other 
motorist than to the road ahead.

Mr
 Dry said: 'He conceded his driving was dangerous, particularly the 
action to overtake on a busy, 30mph street with blind junctions, 
approaching traffic lights at a time when he was not focused on the road
 ahead.'

Mr Dry said after Sarah died, Baillie 'changed his mind' and now says his driving was careless not dangerous.

Baillie, 39, of  Sunderland, pleaded guilty to causing death by careless driving as his trial was about to start but denies the more serious charge of causing death by dangerous driving.

The trial continues.
