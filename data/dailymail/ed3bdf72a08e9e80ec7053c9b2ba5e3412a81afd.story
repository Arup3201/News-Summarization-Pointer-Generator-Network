A torrid day ended Tiger Woods' return from back surgery prematurely as the 14-time major winner missed the cut in the Quicken Loans National at Congressional.

The world number five, playing his first event since undergoing a microdiscectomy in late March, recorded a four-over-par 75 for his second round to fall to seven-over for the tournament in Bethesda, Maryland.

His next tournament is expected to be The Open at Hoylake.

There was a four-way tie for the lead between first-round leader Ricky Barnes (69), Australian pair Marc Leishman and Oliver Goss, who each shot five-under rounds of 66 and Patrick Reed, who closed with three birdies in his final five holes for a 68.

Woods, who opened with a three-over-par 74 on Thursday, made pars on each of his first four holes before a double-bogey six at the fifth.

A further dropped shot followed at the eighth before Woods birdied the par-five ninth.

He sunk an 11-foot putt on the par-three 10th for a second consecutive birdie, before a run of four successive birdies was halted with a par-four at the 15th, leaving him five shots adrift of the projected cut with three holes to play.

Another birdie followed at the par-five 16th, but it was too little, too late as Woods finished with consecutive birdies to miss the weekend's action.

Major winners Mike Weir, YE Yang, Ernie Els and Keegan Bradley also missed the cut.

At the top end of the field, Leishman and Goss each recorded unblemished rounds featuring five birdies to take their share of the lead.

Barnes also made five birdies, but his round was marred by three bogeys as he was denied the outright lead with a round of 69.

Hudson Swafford and Stuart Appleby were one shot behind on five-under-par.
