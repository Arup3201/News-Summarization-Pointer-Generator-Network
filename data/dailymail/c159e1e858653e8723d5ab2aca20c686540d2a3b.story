It sounds like something out of Rudyard Kipling's Just So Stories - how the hippo got 20 terrapins on its back.

But this was a real-life sight for holidaymakers in South Africa's Kruger National Park, who fell about laughing when they saw a fully-grown hippopotamus ferrying more than a dozen companions across a waterhole.

Hippos have been known to attack wildebeest, lions and even crocodiles, but this benign creature appeared to have a soft spot for terrapins and let a whole family sunbathe on its back.

Elaine de Klerk, 42, who captured the sight on camera, said: 'We couldn't stop laughing at him.

'I don't know why he allowed so many to climb aboard, but we think that they were using him as a rock to sunbathe. We've seen this before, but with only one or two terrapins - we couldn't believe what we were looking at.'

Mrs de Klerk, who lives with her husband near the city of Durban, has now nicknamed the animal a 'pond taxi'.  

Hitching a lift: These terrapins jumped aboard a fully-grown hippopotamus in South Africa's Kruger Park, and the creature floated serenely without shaking them off

Hippos can be aggressive and are known to attack wildebeest and crocodiles - but this one was more chilled out
