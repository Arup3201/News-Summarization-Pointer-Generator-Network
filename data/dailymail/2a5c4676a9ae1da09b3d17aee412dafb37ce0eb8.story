Bomb disposal experts were called to a university campus after a student's experiment went wrong, creating a chemical that is 'highly volatile' and at risk of causing a huge explosion. 

Students had to be evacuated and emergency services called after concerns were raised about a sample of a acetone peroxide - a highly dangerous chemical often used in improvised attacks by terrorists - being accidentally turned into an explosive form at a Manchester University laboratory. 

The incident came just hours after a student was injured after a chemical explosion at a Liverpool University lab, which was so forceful it blew off the doors and broke windows.

On the scene: Army bomb disposal experts and the emergency services were called to a chemistry lab in the Pariser Building shortly at Manchester University before 11.30am today

Danger: The emergency services were called after concerns were reported to police that acetone peroxide had become 'crystalised' during an experiment in a lab, making it volatile

Army bomb disposal experts and the emergency services were called to a chemistry lab in the Pariser Building shortly at Manchester University before 11.30am today.

They were called after concerns were reported to police that acetone peroxide had become 'crystalised' during an experiment in a lab, making it volatile.

Acetone peroxide is a highly explosive chemical made by mixing acetone, hydrogen peroxide and acid.

It is extremely unstable and can explode due to mild heating or shock. It has become popular amongst terrorists and has been used in a number of improvised attacks. 

After emergency services were alerted the building on Sackville Street and other nearby university buildings were evacuated.

Sackville Street, Whitworth Street, Princess Street and a slip-road of the Mancunian Way were closed as the police and emergency services cleared the area.

Merseyside Fire and Rescue arrived at the scene in Liverpool this morning and rescued the PhD student

Paramedics arrived at the Liverpool site with the fire crews and the man was given first aid at the scene

Police are investigating why the experiment was being carried out and what precautions had been taken.

A university worker, who declined to be named, told the MEN: 'From what I've been told, they were mixing two chemicals together and it crystalised and became a threat.

'At least a couple of hundred people staff and students have been evacuated. We're just waiting for the Army bomb disposal squad to arrive.

'In our office in the George Begg building the we didn't know what was happening at first. Then university security came in and evacuated all the building.'

A Manchester University spokesman said: 'The university's Pariser Building on Sackville Street was evacuated this morning after a chemical crystallised and became unstable.

'The police and fire service were called and a major incident has been declared.

'Two neighbouring buildings have been evacuated on the advice of the emergency services. We are working closely with the police and fire service who remain in charge at the scene.'

Greater Manchester Fire and Rescue Service urged people to avoid the area but stressed the situation was 'stable at the moment'.

Firefighters were called to help the man at the University of Liverpool and helped give him first aid 

Liverpool University has said it is investigating the cause of the explosion which has not yet been disclosed

A spokesman said: 'There is an evacuation of the building and surrounding buildings as well as road closures. We have a 150m cordon in place and the Army bomb disposal squad have been called to assists us.

'I would stress that the situation is stable at the moment. However, it would be helpful of people and traffic would avoid the area.'

Police and firefighters remained at the scene to assess the risk to the public.

Just hours earlier a male PhD student had to be rescued at Liverpool University after an explosion in a laboratory. The student had to be rescued from the fourth floor of the university building at about 8.45am.

Crews raced to the University's Oxford Street campus to deal with the blast which blew a door of its hinges and shattered windows. 

Area manager Nick Searle, from Merseyside Fire and Rescue, said: 'Firefighters were called to the fourth floor of the building and a man at the scene was given first aid by firefighters.

'We were called after a small explosion involving a chemical at the site.

'Firefighters are liaising with staff on site and are stood by with dry powder extinguishers and a hose. Paramedics were also requested to check the man who was given first aid.'

A University of Liverpool spokesman said they were investigating how the incident took place.
