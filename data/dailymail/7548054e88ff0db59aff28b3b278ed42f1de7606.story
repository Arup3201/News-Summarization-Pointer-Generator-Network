The boxing gloves worn by Muhammad Ali and Sonny Liston during their infamous 1965 heavyweight rematch fetched  £622,000 following an auction held in New York on Saturday.

Dallas-based Heritage Auctions, which handled the sale, said the gloves were purchased by a buyer who wished to remain anonymous.

The bout itself held in the American city of Lewiston, Maine on May 25, 1965, and soon approaching it's 50th anniversary,  was won by Ali with a first-round knockout in what will forever be known as a 'phantom punch'.

Footage of the Ali-Liston fight does not make it clear whether Ali's quick right hand actually connected, and many fans booed. 

Even the most famous photos of the fight show an enraged Ali standing over his opponent, as he lay on the canvas,  gesturing and yelling at him to get up and fight.

After the bout the gloves were initially seized by the then boxing commissioner for Maine, George Russo.

They remained in the Russo family until a California collector purchased them several years ago before putting them up for auction.

The Lewiston rematch was also the first bout in which Ali  stepped into the ring as Muhammad Ali after converting to Islam.

He was still Cassius Clay a year earlier when he won the championship from Liston in Miami. His gloves from that bout sold last year at Heritage Auctions for £544,300.

Ali signed both pairs of gloves when he visited the American city in 1995 to celebrate the fight's 30th anniversary. Liston died in 1970.
