It was difficult to know what must have been more difficult for Caroline Wozniacki, stepping back out onto the court or facing the inevitable-if-polite probes about how she was feeling after her split with Rory McIlroy.

The Dane tackled both with dignity but the most traumatic week in her life - which reports say involved being dumped in a three-minute phone conversation - had not got a whole lot better as she lost in the French Open first round and perhaps the only consolation was that she can get her life back together away from the spotlight.

Choosing her words carefully about  her personal situation, she dispelled any suggestions that the break-up was ‘mutual’. 'Obviously you’re not prepared for something like this, and it came as a bit of a shock,' she said.

True colours: Caroline Wozniacki wore white, orange and green, the colours of the Irish flag in her French Open defeat to Yanina Wickmayer

Dumped: The defeat to the 64th-ranked Belgian was another blow for Wozniacki who split from her fiancee, Irish golfer McIlroy, last week

Disappointed: Wozniacki is left to rue a missed opportunity after losing 2-1 to Wickmayer at Roland Garros

Contrasting fortunes: Wozniacki's loss comes days after McIlroy dusted himself down and won the PGA Championship at Wentworth

That may 
be putting it mildly, as she is said to have been unaware of any hints 
that McIlroy’s bombshell was about to land, an upheaval that he 
responded to so contrastingly on the golf course at Wentworth.

It
 did not help that she faced a rejuvenated opponent in Belgium’s Yanina 
Wickmayer, who defeated her 7-6, 4-6, 6-2. Something to do with that was
 that Wozniacki has also had to contend with a knee injury recently on 
top of everything else.

Following
 the match, looking pale, drawn and possibly a little thinner, she took 
some questions, although asked that they be related purely to the match 
she just played. That was being somewhat optimistic but she held her 
head high throughout.

In
 fact her exit attracted at least as much attention as what was a far 
bigger upset in the women’s draw – the defeat of second seed and former 
champion Li Na by French 21 year-old Kristina Mladenovic.

Coinciding
 broadly with the advent of her high profile relationship with the 
Northern Irish golfer, Wozniacki’s star purely as a tennis player has 
fallen somewhat, and as number 13 seed her loss was not of the seismic 
variety by comparison.

Not going to plan: Wozniacki sits on her chair as she ponders her performance 

'I
 just tried to prepare the best that I could. It doesn’t make it easier 
that I haven’t been able to play many matches because I have been 
injured. I felt a bit rusty out there, it wasn’t really a pretty match 
but I tried.'

She
 added that there was never a question that she would withdraw: 'I 
always wanted to play here, you need to keep moving forward. This is 
what I do and is my profession.'

A
 large Belgian contingent in the crowd were pulling for their player but
 respectful enough: 'The crowd was great, I definitely can’t blame 
anyone but myself out there today,' she said.

'I
 would rather have been her longer but it’s not to be. I guess what’ s 
supposed to happen will happen. So I’m just going to get myself together
 and prepare for the grass. Wimbledon is a better surface for me.'

Her eyes only reddened up when talking about the support she had from her family, especially her father Piotr.

'He
 means everything to me. Your family will always be there for you no 
matter what happens. You know you can always talk, always fall back on 
them, always figure out a way with them to make things better off the 
court. That is always something I have needed and something that has 
made me the player and person that I am today.'

Last week, McIlroy announced he and Wozniacki mutually decided to split only days after sending out wedding invitations.

The two time major winner and Wozniacki confirmed the relationship had ended after he realised he was not ready for marriage.

The
 golden couple of sport enjoyed a short-lived engagement after 
announcing to their million plus Twitter followers last new year's eve 
that they were to marry.

At the time the pair posted matching pictures of themselves with a ring.

It
 is understood the couple - dubbed Wozzilroy in some circles after a 
golf wedge was engraved with the moniker - had been an item for more 
than two years.

They were forced to scotch rumours of a split late last year.

As
 recently as last Sunday, McIlroy's Twitter feed suggested there were no
 signs of trouble in the relationship after he posted a picture from 
Nobu restaurant in Monte Carlo where the pair had dinner.

McIlroy and Wozniacki spotted on May 15, shortly before their breakup was announced

On
 Sunday, McIlroy won the BMW PGA Championship at Wentworth. It was the 
first triumph on European soil for the 25-year-old and followed a 
fabulous final-round 66 that saw him overcome a seven-shot final-day 
deficit to Thomas Bjorn.

But
 while things seem to be going well for the Northern Irishman, the same 
cannot be said for Wozniacki following this defeat from the second Grand
 Slam of the season.

And
 in an unfortunate coincidence, Wozniacki was wearing a white, orange 
and green outfit, the colours of the Irish flag for her match at Roland 
Garros. The adidas colours were chosen a couple of weeks ago, before the
 couple announced their split.

McIlroy
 is Northern Irish, having been born in Holywood near Belfast, but has 
previously represented Ireland in golf's World Cup.

He must soon decide whether to represent Ireland or Great Britain at the 2016 Olympic Games in Rio de Janeiro.

Wozniacki
 is next due to play at Eastbourne in the week before Wimbledon, 
although she sounded uncertain, saying Eastbourne ‘was’ her planned next
 event. Hopefully there is much that will be sorted in her head between 
now and then.

Li Na went down 7-5 3-6 6-1 to Mladenovic, removing one of the few players who is a threat to Serena Williams.
