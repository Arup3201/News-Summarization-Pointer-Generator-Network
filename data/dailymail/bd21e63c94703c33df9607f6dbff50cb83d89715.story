Former New York Yankees outfielder Chad Curtis is being investigated for possible ‘inappropriate touching’ involving four female students in a Michigan school where he worked as a volunteer.

The 43-year-old old, who was expected to become the head football coach at Lakewood High School this fall, has been suspended from his duties as a weight-room attendant pending an investigation into the allegations.

Curtis also worked as a substitute teacher in the Lakewood School District located in Barry County.

According to the website Mlive.com, Schools Superintendent Michael O'Mara said district officials were notified a week ago by a Barry County sheriff's detective about the investigation.

Mentor: Curtis volunteered as a weight-room attendant at Lakewood High School, and was supposed to be hired as the school's head football coach

So far, no criminal charges have been filed against Curtis, who has denied the allegations.

‘I don't believe I touched any students inappropriately...I care about my community,’ Curtis told 24 Hour News 8. ‘I care about my students.’

Curtis, who is a devout Christian, also asked his community to pray that the case ‘would be resolved in a way that is honoring god’ as the legal process runs its course.

Ousted: Chad Curtis was fired in 2009 from his job as an athletic director at NorthPointe Christian Schools in the Grand Rapids area

Curtis previously was the athletic director at NorthPointe Christian Schools in the Grand Rapids, Iowa, area from 2007 to 2009, at which point he was dismissed for reasons that have not be clearly stated.

At the time, Curtis said he lost the job because of differences with the administration.

Winner: Curtis is best known for hitting the walk-off home run in the 10th inning of Game 3 of the 1999 World Series against the Braves

Superintendent O’Mara said before Curtis was allowed to work with Lakewood students, a background check was performed, and it came up clean.

Curtis spent parts of ten seasons in the majors with the Angels, Tigers, Dodgers, Indians, Rangers and most notably with the Yankees, where he won two World Series rings before retiring in 2001.

He is probably most remembered for hitting the walk-off home run in the tenth inning of Game 3 of the 1999 World Series against the Atlanta Braves.
