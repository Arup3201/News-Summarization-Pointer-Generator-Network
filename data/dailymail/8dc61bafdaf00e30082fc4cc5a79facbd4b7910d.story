Former Manchester United defender Rio Ferdinand believes that Real Madrid's Raphael Varane would be the ideal recruit as Louis van Gaal looks to reinforce his defence ahead of his first season in charge.

United are in urgent need of central defenders after Nemanja Vidic left for Inter Milan and Ferdinand was released by the club at the end of the season.

Ferdinand, who won six Premier League titles in his twelve year spell at Old Trafford, believes that Real Madrid's French centre-half Raphael Varane would be the ideal replacement, although he acknowledged that it would be difficult to prise him away from the Spanish capital.

When asked on Twitter which central defenders he would sign for United, Ferdinand replied: 'Varaneâ€¦Real Madrid won't sell though.'

Ferdinand also suggested that Van Gaal should look to the United academy to strengthen his defence, with the former England captain championing the qualities of Michael Keane.

He wrote of Keane: '(He) will be a top player one day. Cultured. Eager to learn & be coached. Vital.'

Ferdinand, who is closing in on a move to QPR ahead of next season, also urged United to pursue the club's former midfielder Paul Pogba, who quit for Juventus in 2012 and has now emerged as the world's leading young central midfielder.

Ferdinand was asked whether United should go for Pogba's Juventus team-mate Arturo Vidal, and replied: 'Really like him, Pogba better value for money now though....'

He later added on Pogba: 'In today's market, I'd fly over & headlock him to sign up!!'

After sealing moves for Ander Herrera and Luke Shaw, United will now set their sights on one more midfielder, with Pogba, Vidal and Real Madrid's Sami Khedira all appealing to Louis van Gaal.

On the signings of Shaw and Herrera, Ferdinand said: 'Congratulations to @anderherrera8 on joining a great club. It's where dreams are made into reality if you work hard. You will @ManUtd'

'If @ManUtd get 10 good years out of Luke Shaw then it's a no brainer. Top class young player.'
