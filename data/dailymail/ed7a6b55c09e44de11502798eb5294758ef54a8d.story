After summer floods and droughts, freezing winters and even widespread snow in May this year, something is clearly wrong with Britain's weather.

Concerns about the extreme conditions the UK consistently suffers have increased to such an extent that the Met Office has called a meeting next week to talk about it.

Leading meteorologists and scientists will discuss one key issue: is Britain's often terrible weather down to climate change, or just typical?

Office summit

It follows the coldest spring in more than 50 years, as well as droughts and floods in 2012, the freezing winter of 2010 and incredibly widespread snow last month.

Experts will travel to the forecaster's 
headquarters in Exeter on Tuesday for the meeting.

Attendees are expected to debate whether the changing 
weather pattern in the UK, and in northern Europe, is because of climate
 change or simply variable weather.

'We have seen a run of unusual seasons in the UK and northern 
Europe, such as the cold winter of 2010, last year's wet weather and the
 cold spring this year,' a Met Office spokesman told the 
Guardian.

'This may be nothing more than a run of 
natural variability, but there may be other factors impacting our 
weather.

'There is emerging research which suggests there is a link 
between declining Arctic sea ice and European climate - but exactly how 
this process might work and how important it may be among a host of 
other factors remains unclear.'

Experts will identify what further 
research is needed and discuss whether climate models need to be revised
 to take into account any recent changes to weather patterns

It comes
 after the National Farmers' Union reported that wheat harvests are 
likely to be around 30 per cent lower than last year as a result of the extreme 
weather.

Earlier this month the Met Office said below average 
temperatures throughout March, April and May made it the fifth coldest 
spring in national records dating back to 1910 and the coldest spring 
since 1962. March was 'exceptionally' cold, averaging 2.2°C.

In more bad news, this week forecasters warned unsettled and wet conditions could last until the end of July and into August.

The last two weeks of warmer, clear days have been replaced by erratic conditions, including rain and high winds of up to 40mph, interspersed with pockets of warm, sunny and dry periods.

Forecasters have attributed the unpredictable stretch - which is being caused by a south shifting jet stream - to just another 'typical British summer'.

The 'blink and you'd miss it summer' is the latest in six months of unsettled weather, including a particularly bitter winter, and unseasonably cold Spring - which saw the coldest Easter Sunday on record.

Jet streams are belts of fast flowing, narrow air currents found in the atmosphere, formed near air masses with significantly different temperatures.

They are responsible for moving weather around the latitudes.

The Polar jet stream, which is the most northerly jet stream, affects the UK, and tends to be further south in the winter and further north in the summer.

But it has been sitting further south than is normal for this time of year, which is why the UK looks set to experience a wet summer.
