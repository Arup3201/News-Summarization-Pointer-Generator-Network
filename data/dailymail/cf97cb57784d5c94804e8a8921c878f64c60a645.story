Senior Labour MPs rounded on Ed Miliband today - as election experts warned the party was no longer on track to win the next general election.

While the party made significant progress in London it struggled elsewhere as anti-government protest votes went to Ukip. One of the country's top polling experts Professor John Curtice said Labour had lost up to nine per cent support since the last local elections two years ago.

Shadow chancellor Ed Balls said the party's performance was 'not good enough yet'. He added: 'We have got more to do if we are really going to win the argument.'

Shsadow Chancellor Ed Balls, on the campaign trail in the Vale of Glamorgan this week, admitted Labour's performance in the council elections had not been good enough

Ed Miliband defended Labour's performance to journalists outside his house in North London this morning

WINS: Hammersmith & Fulham and Croydon are big wins, suggesting Labour has strength in London. Won Cambridge after taking seats from Lib Dems.

Retained control of Harlow Council, despite losing three seats to UKIP.

LOSSES: Failing to win Swindon is a setback, while losing control of Thurrock suggests the party may struggle to win key swing seats at the next election. In the party's heartland of Rotherham, UKIP took 10 of the 21 seats being contested.

Shadow chancellor Ed Balls admitted Labour's performance had been poor.

Mr Balls said: 'It's not good enough yet for Labour. We have got more to do if we are really going to win the argument.'

The Labour heavyweight said: 'We’re doing better than people were expecting across southern seats but now the challenge is for Labour in the north - particularly where we’re clearly the majority party or tight Tory/Labour areas. We have to understand that challenge.'

He added that 'everyone is taken aback on gains across the country'.

Felow Labour MP John Mann hit out at the Labour leadership for failing to take on UKIP.

He said: 'The Labour party and the people deciding strategy at the top, without question, and they told me this, had a strategy of ignoring UKIP instead of taking them on. And that was a disastrous strategy.

'What the party should have done in this election is take on UKIP.

'But the Labour party needs to have a broader appeal. People like me and the views that I represent.. our viewpoint is not sufficiently being heard within the Labour party.

'The coalition of the Labour party is not broad enough and we need to be part of it and if we're not Labour won't win at the next general election.'

He blasted 'pointy-heads' at the top of the party for ignoring working class concerns.

Mr Mann accused Mr Miliband of not 'broadening the appeal' of the party.

Outspoken Labour MP Simon Danczuk admitted voters were being turned off by Mr Miliband. He said: 'I’m not going to pretend that Ed Miliband as an issue doesn’t come up on the doorstep, of course it does.' 

Graham Stringer agreed that the public were not buying into the prospect of Mr Miliband being Prime Minister.

Mr Stringer added: 'These wasn’t the kind of enthusiasm on the doorstep that I have felt when we have been going to win elections.

'And when you talk more deeply to people, they don’t really find an empathy or sympathy with Ed. He’s not getting over his own personality over to them in a way they feel warm towards.'

Mr Stringer was asked if he was worried by the results. He said: 'Yes.'

The Labour MP added: 'Ed Miliband has just said the general election campaign starts here. Well, I am afraid, really, the general election campaign started at the start of this campaign, and we have not done as well as we should have done.'

He attacked the Labour leadership's refusal to grant the public a referendum on Europe and slammed Mr Miliband for his blundering TV performace this week in which he failed to know how much he spent on his shopping.

'The centrepiece of our campaign has been the cost of living, and yet Ed didn’t know his own cost of living when he went into it, he didn’t know how much he was spending on shopping.

'Really, people around him should have said when David Cameron had been attacked as a posh boy not knowing the price of milk that we should not fall into that trap. We should know the price of milk and bread. That sort of thing is unforgivably unprofessional.'

The Labour leader said the party was making gains in key battleground seats - including in London and the south East. But he faced criticism from within his own party for not doing better

Professor John Curtice said the public did not seem to see Labour as a alternative Government.

He said: 'When it comes to local elections, we have quite high expectations of what oppositions should achieve.

'We basically say, if a party looks as though it is potentially regarded as an alternative government, it should be doing very well in local elections, even better than you would expect to do in a general election in 12 months' time.

'The truth is, by that test at least, Labour have not done well enough.

'Most of the seats that were being up for grabs yesterday were last fought over on the same day as the 2010 general election.

'And if you compare Labour's performance vote-for-vote with 2010, the advance is just 3 percentage points - 3 per cent on what was the day in which Labour recorded its second worst result.

'And if you actually compare these results with the position two years ago, which we can also compare most of these places with, Labour's vote is clearly well down, something like nine points.

'When you talk more deeply to people, they don’t really find an empathy or sympathy with Ed'

'So the truth is, modest progress, Labour not even doing as well as they were able to do earlier in this parliament, and thereby again reinforcing the doubts that have always been there that at the end of the day it is not entirely clear that the British electorate regard Labour as a clear alternative.'

Former Labour Cabinet minister Peter Hain yesterday warned the party was losing working class votes – and warned Mr Miliband to adopt a more ‘robust’ approach to Ukip.

‘The problem is that there is a seriously alienated – mostly white working class, often male – vote out there that was traditionally Labour’s,’ he said.

One senior Labour figure told The Times: ‘The truth is that Miliband looks weird, sounds weird, is weird.’

Labour shadow business secretary Chuka Umunna attempted to play down the emergence of Ukip, saying support for the party represented ‘discontent with the entire political system’. But he added: ‘Undoubtedly we’re in an era of four party politics.

Former minister David Lammy said the party should have done better in places such as Swindon, conceding that voters were 'swallowing' Ukip's message on immigration and Europe.

But Labour election boss Douglas Alexander insisted Labour could win the general election based on the results coming in overnight from key battleground seats. The party has seized control in Hammersmith and Fulham, previously a flagship Tory authority, and is expecting positive results in Merton and Croydon.

'Ed Miliband is not on course to win the next election', claimed Tory MPJackie Doyle-Price after the results started trickling through this morning. Many Labour MPs are concerned that Mr Miliband is seen as too 'weird' to win

He told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme: 'I think there is not just a whole group of people who feel left behind by the economy but locked out of politics.

'There is a deep anger and alienation there and the votes that we have seen for Ukip overnight are in part a reflection of that reality.

'The challenge is how does a party like the Labour party seek to respond? And I don’t think simply politics as usual is an adequate response to trends that didn’t build up in the last few days, but actually have been building up over decades.'
