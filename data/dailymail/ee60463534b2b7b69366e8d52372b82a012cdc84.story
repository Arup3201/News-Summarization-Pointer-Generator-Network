Police are continuing their hunt for the killer of the highly popular YouTube channel operator whose site is dedicated to high-powered guns and explosives.

Investigators have ruled out robbery as a motive in the murder of Keith Ratliff, who was a business partner at FPSRussia, YouTube's ninth most popular channel with more than three million active subscribers and a half billion total views.

Ratliffe, 32, was discovered dead in his office that was connected to a residence in Carnesville, Georgia.

Mystery: Gun enthusiast Keith Ratliffe was found shot dead in his Georgia office

Armed: Ratliffe had several weapons on him when he died

'He [Ratliff] did sustain a gunshot wound that was not self-inflicted,'  Mike Ayers of the Georgia Bureau of Investigation toldÂ FoxNews.com.

Police have determined the caliber of gun used to kill Ratliff, but Ayers declined to specify the weapon.

He said investigators are 'actively interviewing people and seeking leads' and that the case is 'progressing.'

Ratliff was shot dead in his office, where he operated the YouTube channel in addition to his other business of manufacturing 'silencers' for guns.

Tragedy: Ratliffe had a wife and a two-year-old son

When authorities made the grisly discovery on Jan. 3, they noticed there were several guns near Ratliff, according to a local radio station report.

'For him not to pull out that gun and try to defend himself, he had to 
feel comfortable around somebody. Either that or he was ambushed,' said Ratliff's heartbroken widow, Amanda.

'You know, it just doesn't really add up,' she told a television station.

'We all want to know and we all want justice to be done,' Amanda says. 'He had way to much to look forward to in his life.'

Amanda said their two-year-old son is having a terrible time adjusting to life without his father.

'It was really hard. To know that he's going to go the rest of his life without his dad,' Amanda said, as their child, Jayden, clutched a picture of his dad that was taken on Christmas Eve.

Besides running the YouTube channel, Ratliff was also the owner of FPS Industries, which works in customized weaponry.

It is located in Carnesville, which is about a 90 minute drive from Atlanta.

Ratliff, whose family lived in Frankfort, Kentucky, with his family, wrote on his LinkedIn profile about his company, 'After a life of loving firearms and computers. I have combined both into
one great new business that offers both viral marketing and quality 
firearms from one place.'

FPS is short-hand for first person shooter amongst video gamers.
