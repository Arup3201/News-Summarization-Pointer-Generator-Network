A video has emerged that claims to show Oscar Pistorius playing football in a prison yard with a notorious underworld criminal.

The extraordinary footage appears to show a dramatically slimmer Pistorius enjoying a penalty shoot-out competition with Radovan Krejcir, who was last month charged with murder.

The disgraced sprinter, who was jailed for five years for killing his girlfriend Reeva Steenkamp, has struck up an unlikely friendship with the Czech fugitive since they became neighbours on the hospital wing at Kgosi Mampuru prison in Pretoria.

In the 90 second clip, South Africa's two most notorious prisoners are seen taking turns to play striker and goalkeeper in the facility's concrete yard which they seemingly have to themselves.

The footage, shot from above on a mobile phone reportedly by a convicted robber, was published today by South Africa's Daily Sun newspaper. 

The pictures appear to support recent reports that the double-amputee has slimmed down dramatically since his incarceration four months ago amid fears of poisoning by other prisoners.

According to jail sources, the shamed athlete is surviving on tins of baked beans, pilchards and an African vegetable dish called 'chakalaka' bought at the prison tuck shop after spurning his rations.

Wearing trainers, grey shorts and a white, unbranded T-shirt that appears to swamp his lean frame, the 28-year-old's thin arms protrude from its sleeves. 

The images are in stark contrast to the muscle-bound track star who made history at the London Olympic games by competing against able-bodied athletes.

During the day, Pistorius is required to dress in the regulation orange jump suit which is issued to all inmates at the jail.

But according to a spokesman for the jail, he is entitled to dress in sports gear for his hour of daily exercise.

As a prisoner on remand, heavily-built Krejcir is entitled to wear his own clothes and is dressed in a striped top and deck shoes for his knockabout game with the famous athlete.

Although in the video Pistorius appears to move easily on his prostheses despite his obvious drop in weight, during his long murder trial, his doctor told the court of the pain the fallen sprinter suffers a result of wearing artificial limbs that fit poorly as a result of weight loss.

The bleak yard where the men are having a kickabout shows two narrow doors, one yellow and one red, apparently used to control the exit and entry of the prison's notoriously violent large population. 

For the purposes of their football game, the doors provide make-shift goal posts and Pistorius shows himself to be useful in goal, deflecting the older man's attempt to score by blocking one shot with a prosthetic leg. 

At one point, the one-time sporting idol has to delve behind some wheelie bins to retrieve the white ball after knocking away Krejcir's strike with his hand.

In apparent deference to his opponent, the Paralympic gold medalist is seen moving a concrete-weighted pole and plastic bag out of the way in order for Krejcir to have more room to take aim at the goal.

When it is his own turn to take penalties, Pistorius strikes hard, but hits one of the door 'goal posts', before sprinting off to reclaim the ball – clearly relishing the short burst of speed.

Prison chiefs are mindful of the threat to Pistorius's safety at the massive jail, where gangs dominate prison life and sexual and physical violence is the only means to progress up the gangs' chain of command. 

He spends much of his day isolated from other prisoners, but Krejcir – despite his links with violent crime – is obviously perceived to pose no danger.

Last month, MailOnline exclusively revealed how Pistorius had been re-classified to a low-risk A category prisoner, entitling him to greater freedoms and privileges behind bars, including 'contact' visits, a radio and the freedom to wear jewelry.

The Daily Sun newspaper, which received the footage from a prisoner inside the jail, quoted an unnamed inmate who complained that Krejcir and Pistorius were getting preferential treatment because they are both white.

The paper reports that Pistorius is given mineral water, fresh fruit and tea for breakfast - treats that are not afforded to other prisoners and prepared only for him.

'We are all in prison and we must be treated the same. The colour of your skin should not be a passport to get on the sweet side of the law,' the prisoner told the paper.

The noise of the prison, which houses 7,000 inmates, can be heard on the video soundtrack, drowning any exchanges between the two men. 

Krejcir, currently on trial for kidnapping, attempted murder and drug dealing, appears to enjoy the yard knockabout.

The Czech fugitive is facing a long incarceration as a prisoner on remand, with a number of outstanding cases against him.

Detectives said it would take years to wrap up investigations into the Czech's links with the criminal underworld including murder, drug trafficking, robbery and fraud. 

Krejcir currently has three court cases running against him, but as an unconvicted prisoner is entitled to greater privileges than his neighbour on the hospital wing.

Krecjir's latest charge involves the murder of a Lebanese national who was shot more than 30 times when he stopped at a traffic light in Johannesburg 18 months ago. 

News of the unlikely friendship between the two was revealed when Krejcir wrote a letter to prison authorities complaining that a treadmill and exercise bike – that he trained on alongside Pistorius –had been removed from the corridor outside his cell.

Krejcir used a false passport to move to South Africa seven years ago and has been linked to the unsolved murders of, among others, a luxury car exporter, the owner of a string of strip joints and a known drug dealer.

In 2013 he survived an attempt on his own life which involved remotely-operated guns which had been hidden - 007-style - behind the number plate of a parked car.

In December, the double-amputee's brother told South Africa's YOU magazine how the athlete had hoped to begin a basketball training programme for inmates, many of whom suffer from ill health due to HIV, Aids and TB. 

According to Carl, Pistorius had requested a donation of basketballs from his family in order to set up the project after applying for permission from prison bosses.

In October, Pistorius was convicted of culpable homicide over the death of 29 year-old Mrs Steenkamp at his home on St Valentine's Day 2013.

The double-amputee shot the model four times through a locked toilet door after mistaking her for an intruder.

He could be released from jail in August and allowed to serve the remainder of his sentence under house arrest.

However, the state has appealed Pistorius' acquittal on a charge of murder. The athlete's own lawyers have challenged the ruling to allow the appeal. 

The next hearing in the case is due to take place on Friday.
