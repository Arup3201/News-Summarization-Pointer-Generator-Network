Budget chain Aldi is launching a 'boutique' range of wines - but will only allow thirsty customers to buy four bottles at a time.

Shoppers enticed by the new fine wines will only be able to buy a limited number during each supermarket trip, in a bid to ensure the range remains exclusive.

In a further bid to appeal to 'upmarket' customers, the German discounter will also put an individual number on each of the bottles.

Aldi is launching a range of 'boutique' wines costing £9.99 each which will include a Tasmanian Chardonnay (left) and a French red Pezenas (right)

The wines, which will come with a specially-commissioned hand-painted tag, will retail at £9.99, more than double the price of its usual range.

The launch is the chain's latest attempt to lure families from across the social spectrum and particularly to tap into the taste of middle and higher income shoppers.

The supermarket's continuing success means sales are growing at around 19 per cent a year. It also now has a market share of five per cent - almost the same as Waitrose.

A spokesman for Aldi said the range has been created by some of the world's most prestigious winemakers for the 'upmarket' customers. 

The four wines which make up the range include red Argentinian Malbec Cabernet, white Tasmanian Chardonnay, French red Pezenas and white Chilean Valle De Leyda Sauvignon.  

The bottle of Chardonnay, Pezenas and Sauvignon will be available to buy from March 30, 2015. The Malbec Cabernet will follow in May.

Jean-Claude Mas, who partnered with Aldi to create the Pezenas wine, said: 'The decision to collaborate with Aldi was an easy one as I have kept a keen eye on its budding reputation as a top quality wine merchant over the last few years.

'I admire their ethos of making fantastic wines available at accessible price - it opens up the wonderful world of wine to everyone.'

Mike James, Aldi's wine buyer, added: 'We pride ourselves on our hands-on approach and close relationships with some of the world's best suppliers.

'Collaborating so closely to produce such a beautiful range - whilst still offering excellent value to our shoppers - has been a real challenge, but we have relished it.'

Malbec Cabernet (£9.99, 75cl): The Malbec, Cabernet Sauvignon and Petit Verdot grapes in this blend are from some of the highest vineyards in the world. Some savoury notes on the nose add complexity to the fruit which contribute to the rich and fresh fruit flavours on the palate, with some added spice.

Tasmanian Chardonnay (£9.99, 75cl): This delightful Tasmanian Chardonnay has notes of ripe lemon with a nod to tropical fruit, honey dew melon and a tang of cream giving it a clean almost glacial freshness. Full and smooth with underlying mineral notes, enjoy today or wonder at its development through to 2018.

Pezenas (£9.99, 75cl) Rich and charming, with a deep ruby colour, this red is full of character and flair with black cherry, blackberry and even chocolate notes. Ripe black fruits and spices (cloves, vanilla, and liquorice) create an intense and unique flavour which can be enjoyed today or left to develop over the coming decade.

Valle de Leyda Sauvignon (£9.99, 75cl) A unique and perfectly balanced signature of Sauvignon Blanc; this exuberant wine is full of fantastic aromas with layers of ripe stone fruit and tropicality. Intriguing floral notes come with a bit of a smoky minerality, freshness and mouth puckering acidity, but with a delightful texture. Enjoy this fine wine today, or wonder at its development over the next year or so.
