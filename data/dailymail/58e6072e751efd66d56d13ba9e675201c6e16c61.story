So there is no curse of Selhurst Park and meeting Crystal Palace in the FA Cup holds no special fear for Liverpool.

Having quieted one unhappy spirit from a past life by beating AFC Wimbledon in January, Liverpool returned to south London on Saturday evening, to the venue where their title hopes disintegrated last season, to face the team which still celebrates beating them 4-3 in an FA Cup semi-final in 1990.

Ultimately they prevailed but not without the odd scare. Liverpool are not yet so strong and confident in themselves that they can dismiss the superstition surrounding a jinxed team with the authority of an assured sceptic. After all, they lost 3-1 here only in November.

But thanks to goals from Daniel Sturridge and Adam Lallana and notably an impressive second-half performance by Mario Balotelli, Liverpool progressed.

Having hit the winner against Tottenham and set up Lallana on Saturday, this was comfortably Balotelli’s best week since his return to England. Not saying much, perhaps, but there are at least glimmers he might make a longer term contribution to Liverpool. 

For Brendan Rodgers though it was about exorcising the demons of Selhurst Park: not that infamous 3-3 draw last season, which he considers a mere footnote in their failure to win the title. It is the 3-1 defeat from earlier in the season which he feels represented a nadir. They have only lost once since then.

‘We were at a real low point at that time with players still trying to adapt to the pressures of playing at Liverpool and the expectancy,’ said the Liverpool manager. ‘I needed to find a way to make it work. We’d been playing 4-3-3 but it wasn’t working for us with key players out, so we had to arrest that negative momentum and get back the aggression and intensity with which the team had been playing.

‘After the game we had to have an intervention and we did that. It was ironic coming back here, getting the victory and putting in a real good performance. The players’ response from that moment has been incredible and hopefully we can continue to the end of the season.’

Liverpool though did not convince initially. Early on, Martin Skrtel was having one of those games where marshalling a back three looked a thankless task. Palace had space aplenty in which to drive and Skrtel was left exposed.

The opening goal came from his mistake in the 17th minute. Joe Ledley chipped in a teasing ball and the Liverpool defender neither met it, nor cleared it but simply allowed it to skim off his head to Dwight Gayle, who nodded it goalwards. Simon Mignolet smothered that effort but only cleared the ball to Fraizer Campbell, who drove it in. 

started well, scored a goal with a ball over their back three, but that kind of hampered us,’ said Alan Pardew. ‘We got a bit too deep. I was desperate to get the team up the pitch a bit.’ Pardew was right that Palace sat back but they looked solid enough and Liverpool’s best efforts were limited in that first half.

‘WeThey felt they should have had a penalty when Senegalese debutant Pape Souare clumsily challenged Sturridge in the box in the 33rd minute. He probably got a toe to the ball but was taking a huge risk.

Lallana came close in the 22nd minute when fed by Jordan Henderson, forcing an excellent save from Julian Speroni. But Henderson, in the 30th minute, and Philippe Coutinho in the 39th, would also try their luck from longer distances but found Speroni no less alert.

The decisive moment of the match came in the 43rd minute with Skrtel again in a muddle, failing to clear and allowing the ball to ricochet off him towards Gayle. With just Mignolet to beat, Gayle shot low but saw his shot saved by the foot of the Liverpool keeper. ‘That turned out to be a pivotal moment,’ said Pardew. ‘We would have been very difficult to beat if that had gone in.’

Credit though to Rodgers. He was bold in bringing on Balotelli at half-time and playing two up front. And his team never tire of passing the ball, patiently nurturing their build-up until they found Henderson on the edge of the box.

He delivered a sublime dipping cross aimed at Sturridge. It was a lovely piece of skill but there was still much to do. Sturridge simply fixed his eyes on the ball and struck a low volley past Speroni, who should have kept it out but was beaten by the sheer speed of the striker’s reaction. For a man who has had five months out, Sturridge is finishing remarkably cleanly and consistently.

There was now undoubtedly a more confident swagger about the visitors and Balotelli seemed to pick up the vibe with his free-kick in the 58th minute.

With Skrtel as the decoy, he managed to drive it through the Palace wall forcing Speroni to parry it. First to the scene was the onrushing Lallana, who finished from close range to make it 2-1.

Palace endeavoured to come back at Liverpool. But with the cushion of a goal lead and able to sit deeper than before, Rodgers’ team afforded them less space and therefore fewer opportunities and ultimately they controlled the closing periods of the game.

Liverpool march on for now. Steven Gerrard is injured but his team-mates are keeping alive the prospect of a Wembley finale to his Liverpool career. And maybe that could prove the start of something for Balotelli and Liverpool.
