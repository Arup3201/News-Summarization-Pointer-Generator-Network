Robert Lewandowski has officially been unveiled as a Bayern Munich player following his long-protracted move from Borussia Dortmund.

Lewandowski, whose contract expired in the summer, signed a five-year-deal with the Bundesliga champions in January.

He scored 74 goals and set up 31 more in 131 Bundesliga games for Dortmund since joining from Polish side Lech Poznan in 2010, helping them to claim the Bundesliga in his first two seasons at the club, as well as the German Cup in his second.

'I was 
four years at Borussia. I knew it was time to make the next step,' he 
said. 'I know that every new player needs time but I hope the transition
 won't take long for me and that I'll be able to give my best from the 
first game.'

Lewandowski missed out on the World Cup after his native Poland failed to qualify but that may prove beneficial for Bayern.

'I feel very well. I had a lovely holiday and my batteries are full again,' the 25-year-old said.

Dortmund 
had declined the opportunity to let the forward leave for a transfer fee
 last summer, after failing to reach an agreement on extending his deal.
