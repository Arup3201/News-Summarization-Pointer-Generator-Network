'Sordid': Rachel Speed, 41, arrives at Cwmbran Magistrates Court for a hearing earlier in the year. She has now been found guilty at Cardiff Crown Court and faces jail

A teacher was in a 'sordid' lesbian relationship with one of her pupils for five years, which started when she kissed the girl in a stationery cupboard when she was only 14.

Rachel Speed, 41, would pick the girl up in her car and drive her to her house, where they would have regular 'sleepovers'.

The couple showered together and would perform sex acts, while the victim was dressed in a corset and PVC hotpants, a court heard.

Speed, who had taught science at Fairview High School in Cwmbran, south Wales, for 15 years, carried on the relationship until the girl went to university.

She was then dumped by text after her victim met somebody new.

After they split up, she reported Speed to the police, who charged her with indecent assault and sexual activity while in a position of trust.

She was found guilty by a jury at Cardiff Crown Court yesterday, and was told by the judge to expect a prison sentence.

The girl's parents had found out about the relationship while it was happening, and made Speed promise to end it until their daughter was 21 years old.

Despite promising to do so, Speed continued to see the girl for as long as possible, and gave her expensive gifts including a car and an engagement ring.

Prosecutor Christopher Rees told her: 'You abused her trust while she was 14.

'You did not want her parents to know because then they would know your sordid little secret.

'You were clearly obsessed with her - even when she went to university.'

Speed agreed she would end the relationship until she was 21 or after she finished full time education - but she broke her promise.

The girlâ€™s mother said: 'I felt sick and angry. My daughter was a child. How could she have her sleep over at her house?'

Deceitful: Speed promised the victim's parents to stop their relationship, but continued it anyway until she was dumped

The court heard how the relationship was uncovered when the girl's mother found an 'inappropriate' letter from Speed.

When they found out about the sleepovers, they went to Speed's house to collect items belonging to the victim. The court heard Speed, of Hengoed in the Rhymney Valley, South Wales told them: 'You're not going to like it but I love your daughter.'

After the couple broke up, the victim 
reported Speed, who was accused of indecent assault and sexual activity 
while in a position of trust.

'Failure to protect': Speed began her relationship with the child while 
she was a pupil at Fairview High School (pictured). Speed had worked 
there for 15 years

Guilty: Speed, who is technically still employed by the school, will be sentenced in November

Speed denied the charges but was found guilty and warned she will be jailed next month.

Judge David Wynn Morgan told Speed: 'Be under no illusions, the only issue is the length of the sentence rather than its nature.'

Speed is still employed at Fairview High School in Cwmbran, near Newport, until the council chiefs can conclude a process to terminate her contract.

A spokesman for Torfaen Council said: 'We apologise for the failure to protect this pupil during her time at the school.'
