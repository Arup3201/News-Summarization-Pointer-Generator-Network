On the run: Christopher Maffei, 43, is accused of abducting his two children

A father who is believed to have abducted his two young children from their home and stole a yacht to sail away with them has been spotted off the coast of San Mateo in California.

Christopher Maffei, 43, is believed to have taken his three-year-old daughter Brooklynn and two-year-old son Devin from their mother's home in south San Francisco.

It is alleged he then drove to Ballena 
Isle Marina in Alameda where police found his abandoned hire car on 
Wednesday, and stole a 44-foot yacht.

The Coast Guard is now closing in on the family aboard the sailboat after it was seen on Friday morning. It is being tracked by a Coast Guard plane and boats from the agency are en route to intercept it.

San Francisco police said Maffei had visited the owner of the stolen yacht with his two children two weeks ago to ask about buying it and to inspect the vessel.

The stolen sailboat is a white Hunter 41 with blue canvas called 'Unleashed'. It has a hull number of HUN41366C707.

A police spokesman said: 'An extensive air and ground search was conducted ... but the vessel was not located.'

The children's distraught mother Jenifer Nipon believes Maffei may have headed to Thailand where he has lived previously or to Mexico where he previously talked about taking Brooklynn and Devin on holiday.

She told the San Mateo County Times: 'I 
want the Coast Guard. The Navy. Anybody who has a boat. Please look for 
my children and bring them back to me. I am afraid for my children's 
lives.

'He got a sailboat and he's somewhere out there in the ocean. I am not sure where he is right now.'

She told BC7 News said her mother was watching the children when Maffei grabbed them and put them inside his car that had the engine running before speeding off.

She continued: 'I'm afraid if they back him into a corner. I just don't want him to snap and do something really stupid more than what he's already done, so I'm just really worried for my kids and I just want them to come back home to me safe and unharmed.'

Brooklynn was last seen wearing a white, sleeveless dress with blue and green designs. Devin was wearing a short-sleeved Sponge Bob SquarePants shirt and a diaper.

Destination?: It is believed Maffei may be sailing towards Mexico where he talked about taking his two children on holiday

Hideout: According to the children's mother, Maffei may also be planning to take them to Thailand, where he previously used to work
