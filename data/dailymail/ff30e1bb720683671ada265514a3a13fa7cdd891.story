San Antonio Spurs guard Manu Ginobili will not be allowed to play for Argentina in the upcoming FIBA World Cup.

The NBA franchise have chosen not to allow the 37-year-old to head to Spain for the World Cup due to a stress fracture in his right leg.

The Spurs sent a letter to Ginobili on Monday informing him of their decision.

No go: San Antonio guard Manu Ginobili will not be allowed to represent Argentina at the FIBA World Cup

Ginobili has previously stated his desire to play for Argentina in the event, which begins on August 30, but the injury carries a two-month diagnosis.

The San Antonio Spurs guard pulled out of the 2010 FIBA World Championship due to family reasons.

He was part of the Argentina team that won Olympic Gold at Athens in 2004, and then bronze four years later in Beijing.

Ginobili averaged 12.3 points and 4.3 assists per game last season having signed a new two-year deal in Texas.

He helped the San Antonio Spurs win their fifth championship as they crushed the Miami Heat 4-1 in the NBA Finals.
