Two dogs were hailed as heroes today after they heard a car crash more than a mile away and went on to save the driver's life.

Dobermans Star and Storm pulled hard on their leads and dragged along their owners, who did not hear the smash in rural Shropshire.

Sam and Emily Lewis followed their pets and they found a woman driver trapped in an overturned car in a country lane.

Incredible: The Dobermans heard the Ford Ka crash, but as their owners didn't the dogs dragged them there

Firemen were called to get the woman, 45, free and she was recovering in hospital this afternoon.

Trainee army officer Sam, 23, said: 'The dogs stopped dead in their tracks, their ears pricked up and they looked at each other.

'Then they started tugging at their leads like they have never done before.

'We didn't hear anything but the dogs obviously heard the crash because of their acute hearing, even though it was more than a mile away.

'Star and Storm were really keen to go back the way they came which is very out of character.

'Out of curiosity more than anything we decided to let them take us where they wanted us to go .

'I was amazed when they pulled us straight to where the crash was.

'As soon as we saw what happened, I called the emergency services and tried to see if the person in the car was alive.

'At first I couldn't see anyone but then the woman started moving and began banging on the back window of the car.'

Heroes: Star and Storm's intervention led to the 45-year-old driver being pulled from the wreckage and taken to hospital

Middle of nowhere: The incident happened on this isolated Shropshire road, more than a mile from where the dogs were

The green Ford Ka had flipped over on a bend near the village of Wem in Shropshire.

Sam and his sister Emily, 20, live nearby and regularly walk the dogs in the surrounding countryside.

Proud Sam said: 'They might not look as cute as Lassie but they are just as heroic in our eyes.

'The accident happened on a road which is rarely used - the woman could have been left for hours if it wasn't for Star and Storm.'

An ambulance service spokesman said the woman had a serious back injury and was being treated at the Royal Shrewsbury Hospital.
