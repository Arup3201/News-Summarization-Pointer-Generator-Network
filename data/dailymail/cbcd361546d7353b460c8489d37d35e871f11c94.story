She had been demanding education rights for women in Pakistan and the attack has provoked uproar around the world.

The Taliban have vowed to kill 
Malala, raising questions about whether it would be safe for her to 
return.

But today he father rebuked rumours that the family might seek asylum 
abroad.

'The moment she recovers God willing I
will be back in Pakistan,' he said in a TV interview with her two 
younger brothers by his side.

He spoke of her 'miraculous' recovery in the first time he has discussed the incident since the shooting on October 9, reported The Telegraph.

Al-Qaeda are furious that Malala Yousafzai - who was shot in the head in a botched Taliban assassination - is being hailed a heroine around the world, it was reported earlier this week.

'At first I laughed because after all of
our sacrifices, my personal (sacrifices), and this attack on my 
daughter, we cannot have had such a cheap purpose that we would go to 
some other country and live the rest of our lives there,' Malala's 
father said.

Mr 
Yousufzai, has been a huge influence for Malala - he ran a school in 
Swat Valley that kept its doors open to girls to the annoyance of the 
Taliban.

If she does return to her home country, she would be reunited with her mother and two younger brothers.

Sunni clerics in the country even issued a fatwa against the Taliban, decrying an attack on a girl as un-Islamic.

But
Al-Qaeda member Ustad Ahmad Farooq compared the attack on Western 
military operations, saying in a letter: 'Nobody spoke up for thousands 
of such Malalas who became victims of military operations, and nobody 
protested for them on the roads,’ reported Fox News.

He added: ‘But these circles made so much noise when we targeted this girl who made fun of jihad, the veil and other Islamic values on behest of the British Broadcasting Corporation.

‘This attack created shockwaves in the ruling circles around the world. They issued a number of statements condemning the attack on Malala.

‘I may ask why? Why is Malala's blood more important than those killed by the army?’

Dr
Dave Rosser, medical director at University Hospitals Birmingham NHS 
Foundation Trust, said Malala will need a significant period of rest and
recuperation before she has reconstructive surgery.

Malala, who cannot speak at the moment, was in a medically induced coma on arrival in Britain last Monday, but has since regained consciousness and has stood for the first time since the shooting.

The girl, who has won various peace prizes, was on her way back home on a school bus in the Swat Valley in north-west Pakistan when masked men boarded the vehicle and pointed guns at the girls.

A hooded Taliban militant shouted: 'Which one of you is Malala? Speak up, otherwise I will shoot you all.

She is propagating against the soldiers of Allah, the Taliban. She must be punished.'

Almost as soon as he shouted this, the militant recognised the youngster and shot her at point blank range. She was shot in the head and neck in the 'barbaric attack'.

She was struck just above the back of her left eye, with the bullet travelling down the side of her jaw and damaging the skull. It went through her neck and lodged in the tissue above her shoulder blade.
