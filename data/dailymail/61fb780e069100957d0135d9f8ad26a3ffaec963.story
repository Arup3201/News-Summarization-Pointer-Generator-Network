George Osborne leaves Downing Street this morning before unveiling the moves to raise the income tax threshold

Millions of workers will be hundreds of pounds a year better off after the income tax threshold was raised by Chancellor George Osborne in his budget speech today.

Some 23 millions basic rate taxpayers will see their personal allowance - the amount they can earn before paying tax - rise to £9,205 from April 2013. The figure will then rise again to £10,000 in April 2014.

The move will lift two million people out of paying income tax all together.

In total, from April next year the average worker earning under £100,000 will save £179 a year. By 2014 they will save £250 a year.

And 23 million basic rate taxpayers will take home an extra £346 a year when the allowance rises to  £9,205. They will then take home even more when it increases again to £10,000.

Many of those expected to be completely lifted out of paying tax will be women doing part-time jobs, as well as youngsters with weekend jobs and semi-retired elderly workers.

The tax reductions have been brought in a year earlier than planned after pressure from the Liberal Democrats keen to show that they are helping low and middle income earners.

Raising the personal allowance will cost the Treasury around £3bn a year. But Mr Osborne said today that the savings would be made elsewhere.

Speaking today in the House of Commons, Mr Osborne said that the Government would save money by cutting waste. He also announce a new personal tax statement that will show people what the Government is spending their money on.

Mr Osborne said the Budget will support working families and those looking for work and 'unashamedly back business'. The Budget will 'reaffirm our unwavering commitment' to deal with debt,' he added.

He said: 'Mr Deputy Speaker, that brings me on to the personal allowance - and central goal of this Budget: which is to support working families.

'This Coalition Government believes that the best way to support working people on the lowest incomes is to take them out of tax altogether.

'And the best way of getting money directly into pockets of working families on middle incomes is to increase the amount of their earnings they can keep before they pay tax.

'That is why this Government has set itself the goal of raising the personal tax free allowance to £10,000 - and we've promised real increases every year to reach that.

'In my last two Budgets, we have made great strides forward.

'We need a tax system that supports work. Two hundred years Adam Smith set out a tax system of taxation and those principles remain today.

'We will take low paid people out of the tax system all together.'

Mr Osborne said that the increases have taken over a million low income people out of tax.He added: ' I am announcing the largest ever increase in the personal allowance - the amount people can earn tax free. From next April that amount will increase by £1,100.

'Every working person on low or middle incomes will benefit. People will be able to earn up to £9,205 before they have to pay any tax. Millions of working people will be £220 better off every year. That's £170 better off after inflation.

'Because higher rate earners will also benefit, 24 million people earning less than £100,000 a year will gain from this measure. We are in touching distance of the goal of £10,000 personal allowance that we all share.

'And I can tell the country that as a result of our budgets, people working full time on the minimum wage, will have seen their income tax bill cut in half. And this coalition Government will have taken two million people on the lowest incomes out of tax altogether.

Mr Osborne said that the Government 
has not settled for a 'do nothing' Budget.

He added: 'We have not ducked the difficult choices - we've taken them head on. A competitive top rate of tax.

'More revenues from those best able to pay. Fewer reliefs. A tax cut for 
working people. Support for families. Low income earners taken out of 
tax altogether.

'Alongside it, one of the lowest 
rates of business tax in the world. A simpler tax code. And a country 
where its citizens know the tax they are paying - and what they are 
paying it for.

'We have achieved all this - and kept
to our deficit plan. Let us be resolved. No people will strive as the 
British will strive. No country will adapt as the British will adapt. No
country will value those who work as we will value them.'

Mr Osborne concluded his speech to rapturous applause by 
saying: 'Together, the British people will share in the effort and share
the rewards. This country borrowed its way into trouble. Now we're 
going to earn our way out. I commend this Budget to the House.

The measures are being seen as the 
centre piece of Mr Osborne's budget and ones that will bring political 
support from cash-strapped families and low income workers.

Measure
to raise the income tax threshold will be seen as  a major victory for 
the Lib Dems who have lobbied for the move. Nick Clegg took the unusual 
step in January of publicly calling for the rise.

Under the Coalition deal put in place after the last general election in 2010, the allowance had been due to rise from £6,475 to £10,000 by 2015. It previously only rose in line with inflation or rises in wages.

The tax-free allowance currently stands at £7,475 and will increase to £8,105 this April. It was due to rise to £8,735 in April 2013, but is now expected to rise to about £9,000.

The £9,000 bracket was not due to come into effect until 2014 but is now being implemented a year earlier than planned. The £10,000 allowance will also be brought forward a year and rolled out from 2014.

Pressure: Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg and Chief Secretary to the Treasury Danny Alexander as they arrived at Downing Street today ahead of the budget

Raising the income tax threshold will cost the Treasury £3bn a year but Mr Osborne said the losses will be covered by 'efficiency' savings elsewhere

Each £100 increase in the personal allowance, above inflation, costs the Exchequer £500 million.

Many of the savings are expected to be made in other areas such as cuts in public spending. The Chancellor also said that lower government spending means he can put some money back in people's pockets.

The Government has been trying to reduce overall government spending which spiralled out of control after Gordon Brown became prime minister in 2007.

Mr Osborne also said he will press ahead with a cut in Labour’s 50p top rate of tax, paid on income over £150,000, to 45p, despite polls suggesting two-thirds of Conservative voters oppose the move.

Mr Osborne believes that the Budget will outline a significant package of 'tax reform and simplification'.

He said that the introduction of the 50p higher rate of tax had caused 'massive distortion' in the tax system.

'No Chancellor can justify a tax rate that damages our economy and raises next to nothing.'

The Chancellor said the the 50p tax rate had raised just a third of the £3bn the Labour government claimed that it would.

Labour leader Ed Miliband tore into the Budget today after George Osborne announced plans to cut the top rate of income tax.

He told MPs: 'After today's Budget, millions will be paying more while millionaires pay less.'

The Chancellor had 'failed the fairness test' by choosing to make his priority tax cuts for the wealthiest, he added.

'In his response to the statement, Mr Miliband told the Commons it marked the end of the Government's claim that 'we are all in it together'.

The Labour leader warned Mr Osborne: 'Every time in the future you try to justify an unfair decision by saying 'Times are tough', we will remind you that you are a man who chose to spend hundreds of millions of pounds on those who need it least.'

He blasted the Government for 'wrong choices, wrong priorities, wrong values', claiming it was 'out of touch', and adding: 'Same old Tories.'

Mr Miliband turned his fire on Deputy Prime Minister and Liberal Democrat leader Nick Clegg, whom he branded 'the hapless accomplice'.

Mr Miliband added: 'Only the Lib Dems could be dumb enough to think George Osborne's Budget is a Robin Hood Budget - Calamity Clegg strikes again.'

Dave Prentis, general secretary of the Unison union, said: 'The Chancellor's Budget has given a helping hand-out to his rich friends in the City and delivered a slap in the face to the unemployed and low-paid families.

'Osborne should be delivering policies to get the 2.67 million unemployed people back into work and economically active. Instead, the Government's cuts agenda is making the situation worse by adding to those numbers month by month.'

Gillian Guy, chief executive at national charity Citizens Advice, said: 'Raising the personal tax allowance is an empty gesture to struggling families on low wages.

'Poorer working families who get housing and council tax benefits will not get all of the money in their pocket, because as their income goes up, their benefits will go down.'
