Environmental groups reacted with dismay today after a minister indicated that the green belt was only safe ‘for now’.

The comment by Nick Boles, on his first Commons outing as planning minister, will increase fears that the Government is looking at relaxing rules on building on the green belt.

Mr Boles was told by Stuart Andrew MP, a former councillor, about threats to the green belt around Leeds.

He replied: ‘I can reassure him, for now, that there is nothing to stop Leeds City Council from maintaining the protection of green belt land in their local plan.’

Shaun Spiers, of the Campaign to Protect Rural England, said: ‘We could have hoped for much stronger defence of the green belt than the minister gave in Parliament.’

In the same debate, Mr Boles, who has described countryside campaigners as ‘hysterical, scaremongering latter-day Luddites’, refused to answer a question on George Osborne’s views on development in his Tatton constituency.

Labour’s Bill Esterson said the Chancellor was opposed to the development of 1,500 homes in his constituency at the ‘so-called Wilmslow Vision’.

He added: ‘Yet for the rest of the country he is quite content to see wide-scale development of the green belt. Can you answer me, do you think the Chancellor is a nimby?’

Mr Boles replied: ‘I hope you will forgive me if I duck that last question. I am very happy to clarify the position and it is very simple, which is there are certain sites within the green belt that are currently brownfield and it is important and right for local authorities to try and bring those forward for development.’

Mr Boles, whose father Sir Jack Boles was head of the National Trust from 1975 to 1983, lives in a 19th century cottage in his constituency of Grantham and Stamford which overlooks acres of fields and woods.

The Prime Minister’s official spokesman denied there were plans to make it easier to build on the green belt.
