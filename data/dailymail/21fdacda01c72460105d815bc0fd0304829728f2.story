Retail guru Mary Portas has demanded showdown talks with Prime Minister David Cameron after accusing the Government of merely 'paying lip service' to the idea of saving Britain's ailing high streets.

Self-styled Queen of Shops Ms Portas has demanded a meeting with Mr Cameron after she was left 'utterly deflated' by the decision to allow a new Tesco superstore to be built in Margate, Kent, which was one of her 12 'Portas Pilot' towns.

Ms Portas, who was hired by David 
Cameron in 2011 to find ways to rescue dying town centres like Margate, 
described the decision to allow the Tesco to be built as ‘a very sad 
day’.

She told the Daily Telegraph that she wanted to meet with the Prime Minister and Communities Secretary Eric Pickles to see if they really care about saving the high street.

Ms Portas hit out at Mr Pickles who she claims didn't even respond to her opposition to the new store in the seaside town.

She said: 'I genuinely believe that we can have a new type of high street, but we need to dig deeper and I'm not seeing that happening and it's getting very frustrating.

'I want them (Mr Cameron and Mr Pickles) to say they will look at this exceptional sign off, they will look at business rates and say they are "town centres first".

'At the moment they are paying lip service to it.'

New store: The Tesco superstore will be built in a prominent location close to Margate's seafront

The new Tesco, which had been fought by local residents and traders, will be a massive 82,000 square feet and sit on what is a key site on the seafront.

The news seemed to confirm suspicions that the original decision to hire Portas was more of a publicity stunt than a genuine attempt to help struggling high streets.

For her key recommendations, which included cutting business rates and putting a brake on new shopping centres, have both been rejected.

Instead, 12 'Portas Pilot' towns were given nominal grants to encourage ideas to revive local trading.

Miss Portas wrote to Mr Pickles last year urging him to reject the Tesco plan which she described it as a ‘disturbing threat’ to Margate.
