A deadly batch of super-strength ecstasy known as ‘Dr Death’ is suspected to be behind a spate of tragic deaths among young partygoers.

Five people have died in the last month – three last weekend just hours after they apparently took the drug.

The first was 20-year-old Charlotte Woodiwiss, a promising student in the final year of an art degree.

Her body was found on December 22 in a flat in the picture-postcard town of Chapel-en-le-Frith in Derbyshire. As her funeral was held there yesterday, tributes from friends were piling up on a Facebook tribute page.

Warning: Charlotte Woodiwiss, who died in Derbyshire last month after apparently taking the drug. Her uncle has issued a warning to young people to think before they use such pills

Beside them was an emotional message from Charlotte’s uncle, warning teenagers of the perils of taking illegal party drugs.

Dr Death, often shaped like Love 
Hearts sweets and also called Pink Ecstasy, has the chemical name PMMA. 
It is thought to be behind a wave of hospital admissions with nine 
people being rushed in for treatment in the last week.

It is sold to clubbers for as little 
as £3 a pill and dealers claim it offers a similar high to ecstasy 
(MDMA) but it is around five times as strong and causes a dangerous rise
in body temperature.

The effects also take longer to act than ecstasy causing some users to take pill after pill, leading to fatal doses.

Earlier this month PMMA was linked to 
the deaths of eight revellers in Canada and there have been other deaths
in Eire, Norway and Denmark.

The five suspected UK victims – 
Charlotte and four men – all died within a 60-mile radius in Manchester,
Liverpool and Derbyshire. Charlotte was a student at Macclesfield 
College in Cheshire.

On her Facebook page, 40-year-old Matt Woodiwiss 
wrote: ‘I’m Charlotte’s uncle and am absolutely devastated by my 
family’s loss. Our beautiful girl gone far too early. I am heartened by 
the fact that so many of you have commented but let this tragic sequence
of events teach you a few things.

Charlotte Woodiwiss, 20, from Chapel-le-Frith and Dale Yates, 18, from Buxton, both of whom died in December, sparking police to issue a warning of the perils of using pink 'ecstasy'

‘Think long and hard about how you 
live your lives, about which group of people you hang about with and 
about who influences you.

It’s all very well writing a few “nice” things
on a FB wall but if you carry on living your lives as so many of you 
are then – as much as it seems like a laugh at the moment – you are 
running the risk of your families being torn apart with grief like mine 
is.

‘So, by all means quote the poems and 
write the testimonials, but don’t let our little girl’s tragic death be 
in vain. Some of you have the chance to be shining stars whilst still 
here, and believe me that is far better than being one in death.

‘So remember Charlotte with happiness,
remember her vitality, carry on loving her as some of you did, and most
of all learn from this as that is the best testament that you can give 
to my beautiful niece.’

The second victim was 18-year-old Dale Yates, who died in a flat in the neighbouring town of Buxton on December 23.

His father Lawrence Beever, 40, said: 
‘So many kids take these recreational drugs but they just don’t know 
what’s in them. They go out to parties, they see their friends  taking 
them, so they have some too, and they don’t realise they’re playing 
Russian roulette. These pills are deadly, and whoever made them needs to
be caught and locked up.’

Mr Beever, who is separated from 
Dale’s mother, Carol, said his son was ‘just a really lovely, likeable 
lad’ who hoped to follow him into the offshore oil and gas industry.

In the wake of the deaths, police made
11 arrests in a series of raids in Derbyshire and warned recreational 
users of the dangers of using Pink Ecstasy.

Then last weekend three men 
died after taking similar drugs within the space of 24 hours. Gareth 
Ashton, 28, a plasterer  from Wigan, suffered an adverse reaction after 
he apparently took the drug and began sweating profusely.

He went out 
into his girlfriend’s freezing garden to cool down and collapsed from 
a massive heart attack.

Friends paid tribute to Jordan Chambers, pictured, saying he was 'such a nice lad' who will be 'truly missed'

Paramedics were called and he was taken to 
hospital but suffered another heart attack and died later the same 
night.

His girlfriend, Catherine Fulton, 29, 
revealed that their ten-day-old daughter, Millie Mai, had died of a 
chest infection a year ago.

She said: ‘It was the one year 
anniversary since her death on January 16 and then four days later 
Gareth had gone too.

Christmas was hard because it was without Millie 
and we should have had her there.

But Gareth was my rock and I wouldn’t 
have been able to get over her death without Gareth.

This has come as a 
massive shock not least because he wasn’t a drug abuser. I’d tell other 
people just not to do drugs.

It ruins the people who are left behind and
we have to pick up the pieces. I want this to make people think twice 
and I hope this opens their eyes to other people’s grief.’

Jordan Chambers, 19, also from Wigan, became the second fatality of the weekend after taking the lethal drug .

A 26-year-old football fan from 
Glasgow, whose name has not been released, also died on Sunday after 
collapsing at a guesthouse in Liverpool having taken the ecstasy style 
drug following a football match at Anfield.

Yesterday police in Greater Manchester
confirmed that toxicology tests were taking place and that they are 
liaising with other forces. They have arrested two men, aged 33 and 34, 
on suspicion of supplying a controlled drug.

What the contaminated tablets could look like: Pink coloured ecstasy tablets in a heart shape which can be lethal
