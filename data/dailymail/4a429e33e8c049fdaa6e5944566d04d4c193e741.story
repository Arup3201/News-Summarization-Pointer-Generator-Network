President Barack Obama coolly taunted congressional Republicans on Wednesday for dithering on his demand for billions to handle a flood of illegal immigration children streaming across the U.S.-Mexico border. At the same time he flatly denied that his own policy decisions have led to the rapidly expanding human tragedy.

Calling the deluge a 'humanitarian situation on the border,' not an emergency or crisis, he parried claims that a 2012 executive order delaying the deportation of hundreds of thousands of illegal immigrants – those who had arrived in the U.S. as children before the summer of 2007 – incentivized children in Central America to make dangerous journeys to and across the Rio Grande river.

'I think the challenge we have that has really caused a spike,' Obama said in Dallas, 'is the significant security challenges in the Central American countries themselves, and smugglers who increasingly recognize that they can make money transporting individuals ....across the border.'

Those conditions haven't significantly evolved since he took office in 2009, many Republicans point out. But a series of reports from Guatemala, Honduras and El Salvador indicate that his policy, called Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA), was widely misinterpreted to mean that today's under-18 set could enter the U.S. and stay indefinitely.

President Barack Obama laid the burden of solving America's border crisis at Republicans' feet, blaming them for slow-walking a funding request and claiming that Central American nations were to blame for the flood of children across the southwest U.S. border

Obama made a push for his 'comprehensive' immigration reform proposal, claiming it would have freed up resources that could have prevented the deluge of boys and girls entering the U.S. illegally without accompanying adults

Obama, however, insisted that the overall 'pattern of immigration into our country' shows 'a significantly lower level [of illegal crossings' than we were when I took office.'

The president did not directly address the rapidly growing numbers of children who now make up the largest proportion of the total by far since the U.S. government began counting it.

Obama claimed Wednesday that his DACA policy, along with a far more ambitious 'comprehensive immigration reform' bill that has languished in the Republican-controlled House of Representatives, should be seen as freeing up resources to tackle short-term challenges like the one currently plaguing Texas and Arizona. 

'DACA and comprehensive immigration reform generally, would allow us to reallocate resources,' he said, because immigration officers would no longer be 'chasing after families who may have been here for five or 10 years and are law abiding except for the fact they they came here illegally.'

When 'they are no longer an enforcement priority, that suddenly frees up a lot of resources,' he said.

His 'comprehensive' approach 'would have put us in a stronger position to deal with this surge and, in fact, prevent it,' Obama declared.

Capitol Hill Republicans have demanded that he use more of their existing appropriations to secure America's southwest border. A few have threatened to deny him newest funding request unless he complies.

Texas Gov. Rick Perry met with Obama on Wednesday in Dallas and promptly issued a press release challenging him to do just that.

'Five hundred miles south of here in the Rio Grande Valley there is a humanitarian crisis unfolding  that has been created by bad public policy, in particular the failure to secure the border.'

Confronted by a reporter who mentioned the statement, Obama was quick to assure the press corps that 'I'm interested in securing the border.'

Perry's role as a prop in Wednesday's presidential theater began with a handshake after Air Force One landed for a presidential fundraising stop.

Chris Christie 2.0? Perry (L) will likely catch grief from conservative Republicans over his welcome of Obama to the state where the GOP says the president's policies have caused the illegal immigration flood

Let's raise some money! (and talk about the border): Obama is in Texas for a pair of Democratic Party fundraisers, and only recently added meetings about the border crisis to his itinerary

Obama walked straight to the governor on the tarmac at Dallas-Fort Worth International Airport, hand outstretched, shook his hand and patted him on the back.

A
 similar political rapprochement earned New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie 
scorn from inside his own party after he physically embraced Obama for 
rushing federal relief funds to his state after Hurricane Sandy in 2012.

The two 
met with Rep. Eddie Bernice Johnson, 
Dallas Mayor Mike Rawlings, Dallas County judge Clay Jenkins and 'local
 faith leaders' for a discussion.

Reporters were not permitted at the roundtable meeting.

Perry, Obama said, had asked him to act unilaterally to put more federal government resources – including a National Guard detachment – on the Texas-Mexico border.

But the president saw the suggestion as an opening to upbraid House Speaker John Boehner, who plans to sue him for taking executive action that Republicans believe short-circuits their constitutional authority.

On Air Force One between Denver and Dallas, White House Press Secretary Joshua Earnest pointed to Perry's presence as a sign that Obama is willing to 
compromise with the GOP about how to handle the flood of illegal 
immigrant children streaming into the U.S. from Mexico.

'After all, Gov. Perry is a Republican,' Earnest said.

Obama, however, slammed the GOP for refusing to write him a blank check in Washington.

'It would be useful for my Republican colleagues to rediscover the concept of negotiation and compromise,' he said.

Roundtable: Obama (R) and Perry (2nd L) met with local government and religious leader in Dallas on Wednesday, more than 500 miles from the border crisis itself, which he would leave the state without visiting

On Tuesday and Wednesday a steady stream of federal legislators, including some Texas Democrats, criticized the president for failing to see the border crisis firsthand.

But he said Wednesday that Jeh Johnson, his newly minter Homeland Security director, 'has now visited at my direction the border five times. ... He then comes back and reports to me extensively on everything that's taking place.'

'So there's nothing that is taking place down there that I am not intimately aware of and briefed on.'

'I'm not interested in photo-ops,' he said.

That wasn't good enough for Texas Republican Sen. John Cornyn, who said afterward that 'Texans do not need a lecture from a man who refuses to even see the crisis firsthand.'

'President Obama can fundraise and issue statements, Texans will work to solve the problem.'
