Hillary Clinton will seek the Democratic nomination for president in 2016 but she's 'taking her time' to make an announcement as she puts the finishing touches on her campaign infrastructure.

Clinton's been all-in since December, confidantes who spoke to Politico said, and she's already decided the make up of her core team, with a few exceptions. 

The immediate struggle is the development of a clear hierarchy that includes husband Bill and longtime advisers yet empowers non-Clintonites managing key areas of campaign.

NO RUSH: Hillary Clinton will seek the Democratic nomination for president in 2016 but she's 'taking her time' with an announcement as she puts the finishing touches on her campaign infrastructure, confidantes say

'Part of doing something right is … taking the time to balance the advice she is getting with her own thoughts. She’s in no rush,' a Clinton adviser told Politico. 'People have been putting a red "X" on the calendar for a long time, but that isn’t necessarily happening internally.'

Another Clinton insider who spoke to the New York Daily News says, 'It makes no sense to announce what she's doing now.

'There's no advantage for her to become the lightning rod of the Democratic party. I would not pick a date: I would try and stay out as long as I possibly could.'

Clinton is making clear effort to avoid the behaviors that sunk her last presidential campaign - chief among those an attitude of inevitability that turned voters off and allowed relatively unknown Sen. Barack Obama to soar past her in Democratic primary and an unwillingness to take advice from anyone but her most trusted allies.

Several aides close to Clinton will receive top billing in the campaign, including Cheryl Mills, her chief of staff at the State Department; John Podesta, the founder of Center for American Progress and a former chief of staff to Bill Clinton; and Huma Abdein, an assistant to Clinton at State who stayed on with her after her exit from the Obama administration and serves as a liaison to the White House. 

Politico reports that Clinton spokesman Philippe Reines will likely serve as an outside adviser as will Reines' associate Nick Merrill, another Clinton mouthpiece. 

Former Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee Executive Director Robby Mook has been tapped to serve as her campaign manager, multiples sources have said, and Obama alum Joel Benenson will do her polling.

Democratic operatives John Anzalone and David Binder will also be involved in the polling operation, the Washington Post says, and Harry Reid adviser Jim Margolis will do her media outreach.

Former President Bill Clinton moderates the opening plenary session of a Clinton Foundation conference in Indian Wells, California, on Monday. Bill will have a bigger role in Hillary Clinton's second presidential campaign, her advisers say

Politico reports that her campaign may already be making some of the same missteps that it did in 2008, however, beginning with the assumption that Clinton will be the Democratic nominee because polls show her leading her Democratic rivals by leaps and bounds.

As Clinton should have learned eight years ago, early polling can be deceiving. The sudden entry of Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren into the race or a surprise showing from an unrecognized Democrat or could peel away enough support from Clinton for another formidable candidate like Vice President Joe Biden to surge.

Still, her team has already begun vetting possible running mates. They include Housing and Urban Development Secretary Julian Casto, Colorado Sen. Michael Bennet, Virginia Sen. Tim Kaine and dark horse presidential candidate Cory Booker of New Jersey. 

The Daily Beast points out that Clinton may have stumbled into another hornets' nest - 'white dudefest 2016,' as few positions of authority in her unannounced campaign appear to be going to women or minorities.

'If Hillary doesn’t begin hiring well-respected African-American or Hispanic political aides in top positions, I would imagine that people will really start to wonder if she is serious about covering her left flank,' a senior African-American congressional aide told the Daily Beast.

'If that is the case they will look for a candidate who is eager to demonstrate that senior level inclusiveness is a high priority.'

Reports indicate that Clinton is considering three women for the role of communications director in her campaign: White House Communications Director Jennifer Palmieri, political strategist and former Hillary spokeswoman Karen Finney and public relations guru Kiki McClean.

Clinton is looking at Democratic National Committee spokesman Mo Elleithee, Politico reports. Elleithee is African-American.
