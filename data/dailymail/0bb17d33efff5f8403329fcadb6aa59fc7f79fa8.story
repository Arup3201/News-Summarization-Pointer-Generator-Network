David Owen has accused Tony Blair and David Cameron of striking a secret deal to prevent the Chilcot Inquiry publishing key documents about the Iraq war.

The former Foreign Secretary said extracts of letters between Mr Blair and President George W Bush have been held back to save the ex-Prime Minister’s reputation.

It is believed the documents may shed light on the allegation that Mr Blair had already agreed to go to war up to a year before the 2003 invasion.

Accusations: David Owen has accused Tony Blair and David Cameron of striking a secret deal to prevent the Chilcot Inquiry publishing key documents about the Iraq war.

In a speech, Lord Owen made the  astonishing claim that Mr Cameron had backed Mr Blair’s decision to block the publication of the letters in return for his ‘neutrality or tacit support’ at the next general election.

The peer also pointed the finger of blame at Cabinet Secretary Sir Jeremy Heywood, accusing him too of blocking the publication of the documents.

The Chilcot Inquiry into the Iraq conflict was set up four years ago but has yet to report. While Sir John Chilcot and his panel have been given access to all the documents, they have been denied the right to publish some of those which they regard as key to their conclusions.

In a speech at the 'How the light gets in' literary festival in Hay last week, Lord Owen said: ‘It is almost beyond belief that the inquiry is being prevented from revealing extracts that they believe relevant from exchanges between President Bush and Prime Minister Blair.

‘By whom is the inquiry being prevented from printing those extracts? We are told by the  Cabinet Secretary. That is like a rerun of Yes Prime Minister.

‘Publication of the Bush extracts would not be blocked if Tony Blair had not objected, nor if that  objection had not been supported by the present Prime Minister, David Cameron.

‘Both men are hiding behind conventions that are totally inappropriate given the nature of the inquiry.’

He then levelled an extraordinary charge – denied by both the Blair and Cameron camps – that the two leaders had struck a private deal.

Lord Owen said: ‘No 10 reveals that they are in constant contact on many issues with Tony Blair and Blair’s own people confirm this. Not for nothing does Cameron see himself still as the “heir to Blair”.

‘It is hard to escape the conclusion that No 10 hopes to … win the neutrality or possibly tacit support of Blair by the general election.’

Lord Owen pointed out that elements of Mr Blair’s communications with Mr Bush have already been revealed by the former Prime Minister ‘and his close associates’ in their memoirs, which were also approved by past Cabinet Secretaries.

Sir Jeremy’s predecessor, Sir Gus O’Donnell, has informed the inquiry that it cannot publish the Bush-Blair letters because they represented ‘particularly privileged channels of communication’, the exposure of which would ‘prejudice the UK’s relations with the US’.

But Lord Owen said that was not acceptable: ‘The conventions and Freedom of Information Act covering such conversations were never intended to be used to block a major inquiry held into a political and military fiasco of a dimension we have not seen since the Dardanelles in the First World War.’

Lord Owen, who has written a book accusing Mr Blair of ‘hubristic lying’ over his role in the war, said: ‘Clarifying whether Parliament was lied to will be a test of nerve for the Chilcot Report.

‘It will not be sufficient to duck out and let its readers determine who, if anyone, lied.

‘We all recognise there are different types of lies. White lies, grey lies, sexual lies, necessary lies.

‘Yet there are black lies, lies that debauch the standards of public life and they must be treated with the utmost seriousness. Many believe politics is the art of lying. If lies are allowed to become the currency of political debate on the floor of the House of Commons then our democracy is gravely endangered.’

Both Mr Blair’s office and Downing Street vociferously denied that they had struck any kind of deal over the documents.

A spokesman for Mr Blair said: ‘This is categorically untrue and completely absurd. The inquiry has had unprecedented access to all relevant government papers throughout, including these ones.’

A Downing Street spokesman called the claims of collusion ‘total nonsense’. ‘The idea of any kind of deal is categorically untrue,’ he added.

But the Cabinet Office admitted that while all the documents had been shown to the inquiry team, permission to publish letters between Mr Blair and Mr Bush had been rejected.

A Cabinet Office spokesman said: ‘Any suggestion that the Government is attempting to influence the work of the inquiry is wrong.

‘At the outset the Government assured the inquiry of its full cooperation. It continues to fully support the inquiry.’ 

A senior source said Sir John had ‘yet to begin’ a dialogue with the Cabinet Office about some unresolved issues, including the Bush-Blair notes.
