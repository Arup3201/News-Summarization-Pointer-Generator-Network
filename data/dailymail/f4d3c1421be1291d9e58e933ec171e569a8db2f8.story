This is the heart-stopping moment a woman believed to be sleepwalking fell onto subway tracks. 

Footage shows the woman walking across a platform on the Red Line T at Davis Square Station, in Somerville, Massachuchetts, at about 8.40am yesterday before falling straight onto the tracks. 

Luckily, the 31-year-old narrowly missed the third electric rail which was live.

A sleepwalking woman survived a fall into the track pit at Davis Square Station in Somerville, Massachusetts

Other commuters ran onto the tracks and pulled her out of the pit. 

A Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority (MBTA) spokesman said she was never in danger of being hit by a train because there was not one nearby.

The woman was taken to Massachusetts General Hospital where she was treated for an injury to her lower left arm.  

According to an incident report, the woman claimed she had fallen asleep on a bench and may have sleepwalked onto the tracks.

Commuter Jim Kang, of Cambridge, heard the woman's scream after she fell. 

He told CBS Boston: 'I came down the stairs and I heard some screaming. There was a lady on the platform. She'd just been pulled up and then thre were two men down there who were trying to get up.' 

Despite the bravery shown by passengers who jumped down to rescue the injured woman, a spokesman for the (MBTA) urged people not to jump onto the tracks.

Instead they should inform a member of staff immediately who can stop all trains from entering the station, the spokesman said.

This was the third time in less than a month that someone has fallen onto the tracks on the T-line.
