These blonde twin girls are set to enter a male dominated industry after graduating with a first-class degrees in construction.

Alice and Jennifer Reynolds, both 24, graduated yesterday with top marks at the University of Wolverhampton in West Midlands.

Both say they are looking forward to working abroad in an industry that employs some 199,000 women compared to 1.28 million men in the UK.

Top marks: Twins Alice and Jennifer Reynolds graduating with a first-class degrees in construction, a male dominated industry that employs 199,000 women compared to 1.28 million men

Alice worked as an assistant construction manager for national construction company Vinci Construction UK Ltd while studying part-time and Jennifer has now got a job at Anglo Holt Construction.

Alice said: ‘The degree will help me to progress within the industry, either in the UK or abroad, and also apply for professional membership from The Chartered Institute of Building (CIOB) as this was an accredited CIOB course.

‘Lecturing staff were very approachable and willing to help you outside of lecturing time, which was a benefit as I was studying part-time and working on-site.’

Jennifer said: ‘The great attraction of construction is the opportunity to work abroad and, with the British weather so temperamental, the chance of working in consistent sunshine is becoming more and more appealing.

Working already: Both girls already have jobs in construction which they are enjoying

‘I now have a job with Anglo Holt Construction, which I thoroughly enjoy.’

Vickie Warren, media and communications manager from the university, congratulated the hard working pair on Twitter today.

She posted: 'Well done to twin sisters Alice & Jennifer Reynolds who graduated with 1st class hons in construction @wlv_uni today.'

Women make up 49 per cent the workforce in the UK and just nine per cent of them are employed in the construction industry, one of the largest and most important industries in the country.

In research about the construction workforce, companies identified a male dominated environment, long hours and not being child friendly as reasons why they recruit fewer women.

Jennifer is now considering a Master’s degree. She said: ‘I would like to expand my horizon in the future into project management so I’m thinking about doing a Master’s degree, but at the moment my thoughts are on becoming chartered with the CIOB (Chartered Institute of Building) and the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors.’

JTL, the leading training provider to the building services sectors, has
seen a five-fold increase in demand from women apprentices.

Thirty women signed up for plumbing or electrical apprenticeships in 2010 compared to just six in 2001.

Around 600 women are currently registered with the Gas Safe 
Register, which means they can legally carry out gas work. In April 
2009, the figure was around 500.

The UK Trades Training, based in South Shields, now gets 30 women a year enrolling in training courses for trades including tiling, plastering, bathroom installation and kitchen fitting. In 2004 they had just one woman turning up for a tiling course.
