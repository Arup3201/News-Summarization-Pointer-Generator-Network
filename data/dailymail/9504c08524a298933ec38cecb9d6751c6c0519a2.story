The singer-songwriter behind the rock anthem Spirit in the Sky is in critical condition in a California hospital after a car accident that left a motorcyclist dead. 

Norman Greenbaum, 72, was the passenger of a Subaru Outback driving near the city of Santa Rosa on Saturday around 3.30pm.

A motorcycle crashed into the Outback at an intersection after the driver, Bonita Perea, 63, failed to yield to the motorcycle when turning.

The woman driving the Outback failed to yield at an intersection and a motorcycle slammed into the vehicle 

Ihab Usama Halaweh, 20, crashed into the sedan after he was unable to stop his 2004 Suzuki GSX-R600,and died at the scene, the Santa Rosa Press-Democrat reported.

California Highway Patrol Officer Matt Pinheiro said: 'There's no stop [at the intersection], but the Subaru driver was supposed to yield to oncoming traffic and they didn't.' 

His passenger, Nhmia Mekonnen Kahsay, 20, was seriously injured. 

Kahsay and Greenbaum were both brought to Santa Rosa Memorial Hospital and were listed in critical condition on Sunday afternoon.

The hospital is not releasing any further updates about the musician's condition and said his family has requested privacy.

Greeenbaum's hit song sold two million singles for Warner Brother in 1969 and 1970.

The tune, which has an iconic opening guitar riff, has been featured in almost 50 films like Apollo 13 and in ads for Gatorade, Nike and American Express. 

It was also included in Rock Band 2.

Greenbaum, who was born in Malden, Massachusetts, said he based the song's spiritual lyrics on Western films.

He said: 'These mean and nasty varmints get shot and they wanted to die with their boots on. 

'So to me that was spiritual, they wanted to die with their boots on.'

Hospital spokeswoman Vanessa DeGier said Kahsay was being treated in the intensive care unit and that his vital signs were unstable. 

She said: 'Critical condition means the patient may also be unconscious.

'Indicators are unfavorable at the moment.'

Perea was not injured during the accident, but she was upset after the crash. 

Santa Rosa Fire Battalion Chief Jack Piccinini said: 'She's very shaken by the whole incident.' 

Investigators do not believe that alcohol or drugs were factors in the accident.

The investigation into the crash could take weeks. 

It is unclear how fast the motorcycle was going at the time of the accident.
