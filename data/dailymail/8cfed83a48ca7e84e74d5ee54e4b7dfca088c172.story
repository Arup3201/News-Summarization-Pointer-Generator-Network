England boss Roy Hodgson has suggested there's more to come from England after a bright showing that saw his side win 2-0 in Switzerland.

In what was billed as the Three Lions' toughest Euro 2016 qualifier, Hodgson's team recorded a morale boosting victory at St. Jakob-Park in Basle thanks to two Danny Welbeck goals.

The England manager was pleased with his side's overall display but admitted there were areas for improvements and that his young squad needed to work on cutting naivety out of their game.

I've never really lost faith. I'm just pleased to see the boys play well, Hodgson told ITV after the game. 'I thought that the way we approached the game from the first minute was exactly what we wanted and we got our reward for once.

'I think we made hard work of it because there were so many chances to score goals before we eventually got the one that we needed but it was a good performance away from home against one of the better teams in the group and I'm pleased we won. 

'I thought they played some good football in the second half. I thought in the first half we were largely in control but they got better as the game went on but luckily we didn't deteriorate too much. 

'I think there are areas there that we've got to improve. But you can't expect players playing their early games, or even making their debuts, to make all the right decisions and not show some naivety from time to time because of the pressures of the game. They are areas we can work (on) and we've got a couple of years to do so.'

England created a fair amount of chances to make the margin of victory more comfortable, but also had to survive a few scares with Joe Hart making a number of superb stops while Gary Cahill made a crucial goal line clearance in the second half with the score at 1-0. 

But following a poor World Cup and an uninspiring 1-0 friendly win over Norway on Wednesday, the Group E triumph will lift the pressure on the national side.

Former England manager Glenn Hoddle shared Hodgson's sentiments that the squad still had areas to improve, but admitted that the talent exists in the squad to develop into a fine international side that will find its strength on the counter attack.

'There's quite a lot of players that are not international footballers yet, but in two years’ time they can embrace this,' Hoddle told ITV post match. 'They will make mistakes but we've got youth and talent that's not even in the team at the moment. 

'You've got to draw the line and move on from the World Cup, we are going to qualify and I think we can progress as a team going forward.

'We deserved it and defended reasonably well. This team needs to be 1-0 up, it's made for counter attacking football - we've got pace with this team. We saw a much more confident team.'
