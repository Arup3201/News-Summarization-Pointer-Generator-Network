The romance between Prince Harry and Cressida Bonas could be back on, after the former couple were spotted enjoying a cinema date.

The royal, 30, and his 25-year-old ex-girlfriend went to watch new romantic comedy film Sex Tape at the Odeon in Kensington, west London - five months after their relationship ended.

After seeing the film, Harry got straight into a waiting car with a bodyguard - while Miss Bonas hailed a taxi in the direction of Kensington Palace, which is a ten-minute walk away from the cinema.

An onlooker told The Sun journalist Emily Andrews: ‘They tried hard to blend in. None of the other cinemagoers seemed to realise.’

Their evening together on Tuesday came after Miss Bonas flew back early from a family wedding in Italy in order to be at the closing ceremony of the Invictus Games organised by Harry on Sunday.

The Mail reported today how Harry finally got the chance to celebrate his 30th birthday last night - two days late - at a black-tie party at Clarence House featuring singer Ellie Goulding.

Miss Goulding, who performed at William and Kate's wedding reception, was said to have played an acoustic set of hits. She and Harry are firm friends, posing for photographs at the Invictus Games.

The Invictus Games were an 
international sporting event for wounded, injured and sick servicemen 
and women. It was unclear last night whether Miss Bonas had been a guest
 at Harry's birthday party.

Harry, the fourth in line to the throne, 
and aristocrat Miss Bonas met in May 2012, when they were introduced by 
the prince's cousin, Eugenie. But, two years later, they broke up in 
April this year.

The Mail On Sunday reported earlier this month how Harry has been spotted on dates with Halo Trust employee Camilla Thurlow since a brief encounter at a club in London's Chelsea.

And, according to sources, Harry has also shown an interest in Egyptian heiress Enayat Younes, 22, who appears regularly on the pages of Tatler, after spotting her in a Spanish nightclub.

Sex Tape, starring Cameron Diaz and Jason Segel, follows a couple trying to delete evidence of their sex tape after they saved it onto the iCloud and accidentally distributed it to their friends and family.

It received two stars from Mail critic Brian Viner, who billed it a 'DIY porn disaster for desperate Diaz'.

A Kensington Palace spokesman declined to comment when contacted by MailOnline today.
