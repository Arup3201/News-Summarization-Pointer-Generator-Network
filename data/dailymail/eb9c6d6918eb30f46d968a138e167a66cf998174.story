A second suspect is facing the death penalty after being arrested in connection to the February 12 shooting that left mother-of-four Tammy Meyers dead

Police arrested Derrick Andrews, 26, on Friday in Las Vegas, Nevada, and charged him with murder, attempted murder, firing a weapon from a vehicle and conspiracy. 

Erich Milton Nowsch Jr, 19, is now facing the same charges following his arrest last month.

Mother-of-four Tammy Meyers was shot during what police thought was a road-rage incident on February 12 

Prosecutors allege Nowsch fired the shots from a vehicle while Andrews was at the wheel.

Andrews' arrest came about an hour after he was named with Nowsch in an indictment.

The trial is scheduled for May 26 and the defendants could get the death penalty or life in prison if convicted. 

District Attorney Steve Wolfson said: 'If you're a getaway driver, aiding and abetting another to commit a crime, you're equally guilty,' 

Nowsch pleaded not guilty on March 12 to the murder, attempted murder and weapon charges during an appearance at Clark County District Court.

He is expected to plead not guilty to the conspiracy charge.

The conspiracy charge stems from allegations that Andrews and Nowsch tried to erase their cellphone records to prevent police from linking them to the shooting.

Andrews is accused of positioning his car so Nowsch could unload what Prosecutor David Stanton said police now believe to have been 24 shots at Meyers and her son Brandon. 

One bullet struck  Meyers in the head and she died at a hospital two days later on Valentine's Day.

Stanton characterized Nowsch as a neighborhood marijuana and anxiety medication dealer who hung out at a park where he encountered schoolchildren and sometimes Meyers.

Las Vegas defense lawyer Martin Hart said he had spoken with Andrews in recent days but hadn't been hired to defend him. 

Hart said he might be appointed to the case when Andrews and Nowsch appear for arraignment next Thursday.

He declined to comment on the case or the indictment.

Nowsch's attorney, Augustus Claus, declined to comment about the indictment or the arrest of Andrews. 

Prosecutors allege Nowsch fired 24 shots from a vehicle at Meyers and her son while Andrews was at the wheel

Police initially suspected Meyers was shot in a road rage incident. 

But days later, investigators revealed she had enlisted her adult son and his gun for a late-night prowl to confront a driver who threatened her on the way home from a mother-daughter driving lesson in a school parking lot.

In obtaining a no-bail warrant for Andrews' arrest, Stanton told Clark County District Court Judge Linda Marie Bell that Andrews responded in his silver Audi to a phone call from Nowsch.

Nowsch feared that a green Buick Park Avenue sedan with tinted windows driving slowly back and forth in a nearby school parking lot was following him, Stanton said.

The prosecutor said: 'He believed the people in the car meant to do him harm.'

He said it was a coincidence that Meyers' 15-year-old daughter Kristal was practicing driving in the lot.

February 13 - Las Vegas police reveal a mother-of-four is shot during an alleged road rage incident. She was later identified as Tammy Meyers. She was teaching her 15-year-old daughter Kristal to drive at the time.

February 15 - Her devastated husband, Robert Meyers, vows to find whoever did this to his wife. He turned off her life support after she failed to recover from her injuries sustained in the incident on Valentine's Day.

February 16 -  CCTV of the incident is released by police as they hunt for the alleged killer and his accomplice. Police also disclose a sketch of the suspect and say he is 6ft, mid 20s and 180lbs.

February 18 - Questions are raised over whether Nowsch acted in self-defense amid claims Mrs Meyers drove back to her home, dropped her daughter off, grabbed her son Brandon and hunted down the car in question. In response, Mr Meyers insists his son is a hero and not a vigilante.

February 19 - Following a tense stand-off with police Eric Nowsch is arrested. Mr Meyers claims he knew the suspect and said he knew the kid was bad. After the incident he claimed he wasn't aware who shot his wife. Added that his wife consoled the youngsters for hours and tried to teach him how to be a man.

February 23 - Nowsch is arraigned on murder charges in Las Vegas.

March 12 - Nowsch pleads not guilty to murder, attempted murder and weapon charges during an appearance at Clark County District Court.

March 20 - Prosecutors unveil an indictment which names Derrick Andrews and Nowsch. It charges them both with murder, attempted murder, firing a weapon from a vehicle and conspiracy. Andrews is arrested an hour later.  

The prosecutor has characterized Nowsch as a neighborhood marijuana and anxiety medication dealer

The coincidences mounted when the mother and daughter were driving home and encountered an angry driver in a silver vehicle who blocked their path, got out of his vehicle, and, according to Kristal, threatened them.

Frightened, Meyers dropped Kristal off at home and instructed her 22-year-old son to come with her to find that driver, Stanton said.

The prosecutor said the mother and son encountered Nowsch and Andrews in Andrews' silver sedan.

Stanton said the cars Meyers encountered that night were similar in color and design but 'from the evidence presented, Mrs. Meyers was mistaken'
