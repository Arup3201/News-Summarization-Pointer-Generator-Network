Complaint: A woman has accused physiotherapist Mark Jones, pictured, of sexually touching her during a massage in a Welsh hospital

An NHS physiotherapist massaged a woman until she reached a sexual climax before telling her: 'Now you're really relaxed', a disciplinary hearing was told today.

Mark Jones, 41, is accused of sexually stimulating the woman when he was massaging his patient - who had only gone in with a sore neck and shoulder pain.

The woman lay on his treatment table as he massaged her intimately for 30 seconds until she reached orgasm.

The tribunal was told Jones then remarked to her: 'Now you are really relaxed.'

The patient, who cannot be named for legal reasons, went to police the same day to complain about her treatment.

She said she felt 'numb' after the assault in a busy hospital - and didn’t know why she hadn’t told him to stop.

The woman, who appeared via videolink, said: 'I felt trapped and uncomfortable. I didn’t know what to do and I couldn’t believe what was happening.

'He came into the cubicle and this time he went straight for my pubic area - there was no messing around at all.

'I did climax and he was aware of that because my body physically moved. That is when he said: “Now you are really relaxed”. I didn’t know what to do.

'I was just so frightened of making a fuss and making a scene. I didn’t know if I screamed what his reaction would be.

'I trusted him and I trusted the fact that I was in a safe public space with someone I had been referred to by the NHS.'

But she was persuaded by police not to take Mr Jones to trial because the stress of giving evidence in court would be too great.

Presenting officer Chloe Binding said: 'Detective Constable Gary Watts said it was her word against his and the process of giving evidence in a criminal trial would be difficult.

'The patient said she felt unable to continue with the police complaint and signed a document saying she would not go further with it.'

The Health and Care Professions Council hearing in Cardiff was told the woman suffered from fibromyalgia - which causes muscle pain across the body.

She was referred by her GP for physiotherapy treatment with Mr Jones at Ystradgynlais Community Hospital, near Swansea, in South Wales.

The woman, who appeared via videolink, said she was persuaded not to take Mr Jones to court after police said giving evidence would be difficult coming from a small rural area.

She said: 'I went to see DC Gary Watts in the police station and he said that a second complaint had been made by another patient.

'Trusted': The alleged incident took place at Ystradgynlais Community Hospital, near Swansea

'He told me the identity of the other woman and I couldn’t understand why he did that.

'He told me that the interview with her would not be valid evidence in court and so therefore it would be my word only against Mark Jones.

'The CPS were willing to take the case on and I had to go through with the decision to face Mr Jones in court where I would probably find it very stressful.

'I was advised that details would probably be made public - that there would be a chance that I would be made to look like I was compliant. I was advised that living in a very small community can have an effect. I decided that I couldn’t go through with the stress of going to court.'

The hearing was read the end of woman’s police statement written up by DC Gary Watts.

It ended by saying: 'All things considered I don’t think I am strong enough to go through a court case. I maintain that Mark Jones sexually assaulted me.'

The woman had been treated by Mr Jones for six months before the alleged sex attack in January 2012.

She said she went with neck and shoulder pains but as her treatment sessions went on Mr Jones began to focus more on her 'pubic area'.

The woman said Jones had got 'more and more confident' during the treatments until he sexually assaulted.

The HPCP conduct and competence hearing was told Jones was accused of three sexual offences and a catalogue of other charges related to poor practice and record keeping.

Jones denied any sexual touching took place but admitted a series of failings in his physiotherapy practices and record keeping.

The hearing continues.
