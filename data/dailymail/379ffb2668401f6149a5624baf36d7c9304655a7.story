Venus Williams has suggested she is likely to follow her sister Serena and end her 14-year boycott of the prestigious Indian Wells tournament next year.

The 34 year-old American gave her clearest indication yet that she would return before the end of her career following a 6-3 7-6 victory over Caroline Wozniacki that took her into the quarter finals.

Venus has not played in March's high profile WTA event in the Californian desert since 2001 when, as has been well-documented, she made a late withdrawal from a semi-final match against her sister with a knee injury. Serena subsequently got a hostile reception when she played in the final.

The younger sibling ended the family boycott this year, and now it looks like both of them may well be back as well in 2016.

Asked what she thought of Serena's warm reception at Indian Wells earlier this month Venus responded: 'It was wonderful to see. I definitely watched every moment, and it was great to see her and my family there. Next year will be a big year for us being an Olympic year. I can't exactly say what my schedule will be, but it was wonderful to see her reception.'

Did that mean she had softened her own stance? 'Oh, yeah, absolutely. I have heard so much about how much the tournament has just improved in general in terms of the fans and the players.

'So it will be something to see for me.'

Venus said that she had not fully discussed the matter with Serena but went on: ' I think really what Serena did and how she went about it was just awesome for me as a big sister to see, because I feel like usually I'm the big sister. I feel like in this instance she took the role of big sister.

'It was really nice. I love how, you know, we continue to protect each other no matter what. She did a fantastic job out there, even though she wasn't feeling her best. So like I said, I think the tournament's amazing. I also said next year is an Olympic year, so my whole focus is on trying to get to the Olympics.

'So I don't know what tournaments I'm going to play as long as I'm at the Olympics. That's my goal, to be healthy enough. So I think it would be awesome to return, but I don't know what my schedule is next year. It's going to be all around that.'
