A council has refused to help one of its disabled tenants cut her garden - despite the weeds growing taller than her.

Sharon O’Connor, 43, who has the dwarfism condition achondroplasia and is registered disabled, is just 3ft 9in.

But a back problem means she can't cut the grass herself and has been forced to watch her garden grow out of control.

The final straw came when the weeds grew to the point that they are now taller than she is and she called her landlords Connect Housing to ask for help.

Jungle: Sharon O'Connor, who suffers from dwarfism and stands just 3ft 9ins tall, can no longer be seen when she walks into her garden as it has become so overgrown the weeds and grass are now taller than she is

A weeding mess: Miss O'Connor is unable to cut back the grass and weeds in her garden in Leeds, West Yorkshire, herself because she is registered disabled with a back condition

But housing officials refused - saying they are only responsible for the building in Leeds, West Yorkshire, not its surrounding grounds.

Miss O’Connor, who is registered disabled and lives with her 15-year-old daughter Lauren, who also has dwarfism and is 3ft 4ins tall, said: 'It is so overgrown you can barely see me if I go in the grass. It’s like playing ‘Where’s Wally’.

'The landlords say the shell of the house is theirs but the rest is my problem and there’s nothing they can do.

'But they should know I cannot do it, just by looking at me. I can’t get in there myself.

Miss O'Connor said she would ask to be moved but the house has been adapted for her and her daughter's needs

'I am registered disabled because of 
my back and am on the waiting list for an operation. I need the garden 
doing, I cannot have it like that.'

Miss
O'Connor said she has repeatedly rung the landlords but had no success.
Miss O’Connor added that she would request to be moved but the house 
has already been adapted for her and her daughter’s needs.

She said: 'As a single mum I can’t afford to hire someone to do it.

'I see other people doing their grass and it makes me think ‘I wish someone would just come and help me’.

'I’m upset because it rubs in when I see other people out in their gardens and I can’t use mine.

'I would ask friends and neighbours to help but its steep and bumpy and I don’t want anyone to hurt themselves. It needs to be done by a professional.'

Helen Lennon, director of service development at Connect Housing, said: 'We are sorry that Miss O’Connor is struggling to look after her garden.

'We know many people on low incomes, particularly older people and people with disabilities, are in a similar position.

'We are looking at ways to help in the future by offering an affordable gardening service for people with private gardens. Our support worker will contact Miss O’Connor shortly to discuss how she can get help.'

Achondroplasia affects around one in 25,000 people. The average adult height is 4ft 4ins for men and 4ft 1in for women.
