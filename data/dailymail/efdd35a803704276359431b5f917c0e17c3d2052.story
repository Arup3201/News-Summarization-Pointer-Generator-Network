He is a Kop icon, the warrior-captain who has inspired Liverpool to many famous victories during an eventful quarter-century association with the club.

But Steven Gerrard has revealed an awkward secret - he owned a Manchester United kit as a kid.

The aspiring footballer, who grew up in the Huyton area of the city, had divided loyalties prior to joining Liverpool's academy at the age of eight and admits he could have ended up supporting their greatest foes.

The Liverpool captain announced this week that he will be leaving for LA Galaxy at the end of the season 

He told FourFourTwo: 'Up until the age of eight I could have supported anyone.

'When I was younger I had all kinds of different kits: Tottenham, Norwich, Real Madrid, Barcelona... I even had a United kit.

'We had a few Everton fans in the family who were trying to get me down the Blue road, but once I started understanding the game and listening to my dad and brother talk about Liverpool's great history, that was it.'

A picture of a seven-year-old Gerrard wearing an Everton kit and posing with the League trophy and the Charity Shield at Goodison Park emerged a few years back. But owning a United strip is a new revelation.

Former England international Gerrard, 34, has certainly played a full part in that 'great history' but his association with the club as a player will finish when he moves to the Los Angeles Galaxy this summer.

At least Gerrard has proven his loyalty to the Liverpool cause by scoring regularly against United - he has eight goals in 33 appearances against them.
