Liverpool's chairman Tom Werner was also at Anfield for the game and was spotted in the stands during the match.

The American owners have expressed that they're pleased with the side's performances in recent weeks and will be delighted with the result against Mauricio Pochettino's side.

The Liverpool owners would have been delighted to see Lazar Markovic opening the scoring for his side. 

The winger fired home following a Liverpool break and Henry would have no doubt been ecstatic to see the summer signing give the home team the lead. 

But the lead didn't last long as danger man Harry Kane then found the net to level the scores.

Daniel Sturridge then waltzed his way into the box before being brought down by Danny Rose.

Captain Steven Gerrard then stepped up and stuck the penalty away leaving Henry and Werner smiling with joy. 

But the smile wouldn't have lasted long after Mousa Dembele scrambled home to level the sides up.
