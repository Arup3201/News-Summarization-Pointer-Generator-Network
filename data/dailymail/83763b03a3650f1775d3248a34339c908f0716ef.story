Perhaps I'd overdone it by following Super Bowl Sunday? Or perhaps Transfer Deadline Monday turned out to be like any other Monday... but arguably, deadlier. 

To the point where perhaps the most interesting move on Sky Sports' coverage of the day was Jim White's former sidekick, Natalie Sawyer, making a move to the afternoon shift. With the station's rising star Kate Abdo moving in the opposite direction. Making the yellow dress her own.

Of course, I mainly blame the world of football for not splashing some rash cash to keep us all entertained as the clock ticked. But I also have to take some of the blame myself. Because I got what I wished for.

When reviewing Sky Sports' coverage of the last window, I said enough was enough with the various circus acts that were happening outside grounds across the country. 

With Sky Sports' reporters acting as the unwitting, or sometimes excruciatingly witting ring masters.

Well I got what I asked for. And man alive is what it has been replaced with dull. I'm sure their reporter Alan Irwin is delighted, though. He spent his evening in Everton's car park. And the only thing he got in his ear was a word from Jim and Kate back at Sky Sports HQ.

But he had among the best of it. At least he might be asked to get out of the way so someone could move their motor. Some reporters were left alone in dark, silent stadiums. Their faces lit up like characters in The Blair Witch Project. 

One reporter, Tim Thornton, was in the solemn surroundings of Hull City's KC Stadium. At least I assume it was Hull. You could see the 'H' and 'LL's' behind his head. But was the letter he was blocking an 'E'?

There were some worthy attempts to jazz things up. Niall Quinn's flourish pronouncing 'Cuadrado' certainly chirped Paul Merson up. And Jim couldn't believe his luck when he saw himself in a viral, his head transplanted to MC Hammer's body for a rousing 'Deadline Day' rendition of 'You Can't Touch This'. Perhaps a new career as McHammer, Jim?

But if none of this was enough to stop your deadline day flat-lining, there was, for the first time, an alternative. This year, BT Sport decided to go head to head with Sky Sports with their own transfer window show. 

Inside their arena-sized studio, around several desks and with Des Kelly at the helm, an army of presenters, pundits, comics and impressionists - plus agent Jon Smith and Simon Jordan from the business end - were all drafted in to pick their way through the last few hours of deadline day.

Although when they asked the question 'Ditch the window?', just half an hour into their coverage, I think the tone was immediately set as to how they were going handle their coverage.

Which was, essentially, to not really get caught up in the hysteria of it all. Of which there wasn't any, anyway. So probably a good call?

BT's approach was much more considered, deciding instead to focus on the ramifications of it all, rather than grind away at the rumour mill too heavily. It was chat heavy stuff. Indeed, at times, too much so. But there was some light to the shade.

That was particularly evident at the start of their coverage when the aforementioned Simon Jordan must have thought he was staring into a mirror. And saw Robbie Savage staring back. 

Perched at either end of Des' desk, this got very tetchy, very quickly between the blonde, bearded book ends. First Jordan scoffed 'it always amuses me when people have observations about who should be in a team' when Robbie shared his thoughts about Chelsea's best eleven.

And he was even stroppier when Savage explained the tricks he'd pulled to manoeuvre a deadline day deal to get out of Birmingham City. 'You'd have stayed and done as you were told', said Simon, before also accusing him as being the kind of player who, 'to some extent, holds clubs to ransom'.

Robbie flashed the shiney gnashers. But I wouldn't say was exactly  smiling.

Meanwhile back at Sky Sports HQ, Jim was, in time honoured tradition, also working his molars overtime. But his claim at around 10.45 that it was 'all go' whistled just a little hollow through them.

'All over' might have been closer to the truth. Indeed, as eleven o'clock came around and the camera focussed on the clock in the tower at Westminster, I'm sure even a rather bored Big Ben could only muster about eight bongs?

And if this wasn't indication enough, even before the great bell had stopped its tolling, one of Jim's pundits was trying to make his escape from transfer deadline day. 'Not so fast, Mr Merson' ordered Mr White as he told us Paul had tried to make a break for the taxi he had ordered. Frankly Mers, I know how you feel.
