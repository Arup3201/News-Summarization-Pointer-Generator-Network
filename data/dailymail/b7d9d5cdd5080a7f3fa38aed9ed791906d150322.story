For most patients the GP is their first port of call when they fall ill. But a survey has revealed one in three think their local doctors are now so busy that they could be misdiagnosed.

The poll suggests these fears are well-placed with a quarter saying they had been wrongly diagnosed or knew someone who had been over the past five years.

However, only 56 per cent of those currently registered with a GP said they would be confident enough to challenge their doctor if they thought they were wrong.

Unconvinced by the diagnosis? Nearly half of those surveyed said they wouldn't challenge their GP if they thought they were wrong

Young adults were surprisingly even less likely to challenge their GP, with 64 per cent of 18 to 24 year-olds saying they wouldn't feel confident enough to speak up.

'Weâ€™re all aware that GPs are under pressure; they are often overstretched and despite the level of skill that exists in this field, probably only have the capacity retain around 200 conditions and diseases in their memory out of the many thousands that exist, said Jason Maude, founder of Isabel Healthcare, which commissioned the survey of more than 2,000 adults.

'This research suggests that there is a need to support and better equip both GPs and patients to help achieve a quicker and more accurate diagnosis through more effective communication and collaboration.'

The average GP consultation in England lasts just seven minutes, so to save time doctors advise patients to try get to the point quickly and be truthful - however embarrassing this may feel.

They also suggest you do some research at home but to arrive with a one-page summary of your findings rather than reams of information.

To this end Isabel Healthcare has developed an online symptom checker that allows patients to research possible diagnoses based on their symptoms.

Isabel Healthcare claim their symptom checker is 95 per cent accurate compared to 50 per cent for 'Dr Google'

The designers say the checker works by searching a database of 6,000 diseases and is far more accurate than Google in predicting an illness.

So searching for the symptoms - 'itchiness', 'back ache' and 'red rash' suggests drug allergy, contact dermatitis and Lyme Disease. Clicking on the condition takes you to other online sources with extra information, helping you to eliminate unlikely causes.

Sir Graeme Catto, President of the College of Medicine and former President of the GMC, said: 'During my time as President of the GMC, I saw many cases of unfortunate diagnostic error.

'With so many conditions and diseases that can be easily missed when assessing patients, there is a critical need for modern technology such as the Isabel Symptom Checker to help patients better understand the possible diagnoses that could be causing their symptoms and work in collaboration with their GPs.'
