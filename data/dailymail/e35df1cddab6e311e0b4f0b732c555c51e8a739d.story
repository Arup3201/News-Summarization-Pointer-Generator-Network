Sci-fi fans dressed as a host of intergalactic characters and comic book heroes have gathered to play games, knit and fly broomsticks at a self-confessed 'geek festival' in London.

The three day convention near Heathrow airport, is a hub for 'geeky interests' and has workshops on everything from science fiction and fantasy literature to knitting, gaming and comics.

Nine Worlds GeekFest is the UK's answer to established sci-fi conventions such as Dragon*Con, SDCC and GenCon in the U.S. and is described as a 'fan-run multi-genre geek event'.

It is named after the nine worlds of Norse mythology but helpfully also sounds like something from a sci-fi film.

The festival's website says: 'France can drum up over 20,000 sci-fi fans for Utopiales, even Finland 
can find 15,000 fans for FinnCon.

'But when it comes to large fan-driven 
residential multi-genre sci-fi cons in the UK, pickings are pretty slim.'

Convention attendees play the board game 'Pandemic' in a gaming room. While the convention is sci-fi focused, it also caters to various geeky interests, including specialist boardgames

While aliens could be spotted in a local coffee shop as sci-fi fans arrived at the Radisson Hotel near Heathrow, the organisers of GeekFest stressed the festival is more than a sci-fi event.

Advertising the event that took place this weekend, the organisers said: 'There will be lots of sci-fi/fantasy TV/film and literature stuff going 
on at Nine Worlds and there'll be even more other stuff like science and 
creative writing and film making that have no direct link to sci-fi other than a degree of overlap in fan bases.'

Festival goers attended creative writing workshops, knitted a squid out of plastic bags, played Harry Potter's favourite game, Quidditch, as well as plenty of specialist boardgames, among other activities.

Nine Worlds is focused on creating a place where fans can have conversations with writers and directors of sci-fi films and novels instead of focusing on selling merchandise and celebrity signings

Nine Worlds is focused on creating a place where fans can have conversations with writers and directors of sci-fi films and novels instead of focusing on selling merchandise and celebrity signings.

Perhaps taking a swipe at other big sci-fi conventions, the organisers said: 'The merch and celeb market feels pretty well covered by the soulless corporate expos.'

The organisers have also placed emphasis on being a diverse and inclusive festival and said: 'We're aiming to dump the sexism that infests many geek spaces and sci-fi cons.'

All proceeds from the convention will be to a charity and the organisers of the event are volunteers.

Over in the U.S., a Swedish gaming team has won The International Dota 2 video game competition to scoop a prize of Â£924,000 the title, with 'The Alliance' winning the competition having defeated  Ukraine's 'Natus Vincere'.

The competition had the biggest prize pool in e-sports history and the final was watched by 1,700 people at Benaroya Hall in Seattle, as well as being streamed live on the internet.

Dota 2 is a free-to-play multiplayer action strategy game that was released in beta two years ago and for Microsoft Windows, OS X and Linux in July this year by Valve Corporation, which offers the title exclusively on its Steam content delivery platform.

The game consists of multiplayer matches between two teams of five players who attempt to destroy their opponent's fortified strongholds.
