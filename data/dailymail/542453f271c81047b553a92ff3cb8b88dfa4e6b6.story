Reading have unveiled their new loan signing, Chelsea's Dutch Under 21 international Nathan Ake, who will be at the Championship side until April 22.

The 20-year-old, who joined the Blues in the summer of 2011, has made 11 Chelsea first-team appearances, including games in the Champions League and was an unused substitute in the 2015 Capital One Cup final win over Tottenham.

Ake, who can play as a defensive midfielder, left-back or centre-half and has a long-term contract at Stamford Bridge, will gain some more valuable experience with the Royals, who are now managed by former Chelsea assistant boss Steve Clarke.

'I am delighted to add a player of Nathan's quality to our first team squad at this important time of the season,' Clarke said on Reading's official website.

'He has been a fixture in Chelsea's first team squad this season and we are grateful that Chelsea have allowed him to join us here at Reading to get some competitive minutes on the pitch.

'He is a very talented player who I have been aware of for some time and I look forward to working with Nathan in the coming weeks.'

Reading will face Arsenal in the FA Cup semi-final at Wembley during Ake's loan spell, but the player is ineligible having played against Watford in round three.
