A married couple were shocked after a thief who stole their wedding rings 15 years ago returned them, along with a heartfelt apology.

The four gold rings disappeared from the Riphagen family's home when their 16-year-old daughter, Margot, threw a house party in 1998.

But they have now been reunited with the sentimental belongings after the 'dumb kid' who stole them found the jewelry while cleaning and decided to 'right a wrong.'

The mystery thief tracked down the couple through their daughter, who is now 31 and lives in Portland, Oregon, and posted the rings back complete with the touching letter.

A photograph of the hand-written note made its way to Reddit and has now gone viral.

'Mr and Mrs Riphagen, I am writing you to apologize for being in possession of something I am sure you truly value and miss,' the person wrote before explaining that he or she 'regretfully, stupidly' took the rings from the family's home many years ago.

'I recently found these rings while cleaning and I wanted to make sure to return them as I'm sure they were missed dearly,' the thief went on.

The robber explains that they looked through old yearbooks then researched online where they found the workplace of Mrs Riphagen, where they sent the rings and the letter.

'I hope you are the right Riphagen family,' the thief wrote.

The rings that were stolen included the mother's wedding ring and a ring Mr Riphagen gave his wife when their first child was born.

The thief also made off with one set of 
grandparents' wedding bands that had been intended for the children, 
according to Reddit user WhoBeKnow, who reportedly went to school with 
the couple's daughters.

The person went on the write: 'Again, I am truly sorry for any pain, heartache that my actions may have caused your family. I hope that you can find it in your hearts to forgive me. As an adult I realize how sentimental items like this can be.

'Sincerely regretful. A dumb kid who wants to right a wrong.'

WhoBeKnow wrote under the picture of the letter that the family was thrilled to have the rings back, even after such a long time.

'The family doesn't really care who sent it, certainly doesn't want to seek out who did it, and is just grateful to have these things back,' WhoBeKnow posted.

'They're a lovely family and I'm so happy to see these sentimental things returned to them.'

Margot Riphagen told the Huffington Post she was 'shocked' when the treasured possessions turned up.

'I happened to be home visiting my parents. I was nosing around in their stuff on the counter while I was drinking my morning coffee and stumbled upon it,' she told the website.

'My mother said "You had better sit down." And I opened it and was shocked, especially because I didn't know the rings earmarked for me and my sister even existed.'
