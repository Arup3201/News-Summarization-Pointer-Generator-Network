Investigators are examining Boston bombing suspect Tamerlan Tsarnaev's visit to Dagestan in Russia's turbulent Caucasus region

Investigators are examining whether Boston bombing suspect Tamerlan Tsarnaev was influenced by a distant cousin with ties to extremist Islamist groups in Russia.

Magomed Kartashov is founder and leader of a group called The Union of the Just which reportedly promotes the application of Islamic Sharia law and has protested against the United States.

Tsarnaev is said to have met Kartashov for the first time when he spent six month's in Dagestan, Russia's turbulent Caucasus region, last year.

Tsarnaevâ€™s mother Zubeidat told TIME Magazine that the two 'became very close.'

The Union of the Just publicly renounces violence, but several of its members have ties to militants.

A lawyer for Kartashov confirmed to ABC News that Russian security agents recently interviewed her client about his links to Tsarnaev.

Kartashov admits that the two were close but insists that it was Tsarnaev who tried to 'pull him into extremism'.

Kartashov is currently in jail on charges of resisting police in an unrelated matter. His lawyer expects he will remain there for at least two more months.

Tamerlan Tsarnaev, 26, was killed during a violent standoff with police on April 19, days after he and his brother Dzhokhar, 19, allegedly planted homemade bombs at the finish line of the Boston Marathon.

Dzhokhar Tsarnaev was captured alive and has been charged with using and conspiring to use a weapon of mass destruction. He faces the death penalty.

Ever since the attack, investigators have been trying to understand how the brothers would have become radicalised to the point of wanting to kill and maim people in the U.S., the country they called home.

Much of the focus has been on Tamerlan Tsarnaev's six-month visit to Dagestan, a restive region in southern Russia that is home to an Islamist militant insurgency. They want to know if and how Tamerlan attempted to join militant groups there.

Earlier, a U.S. official confirmed to
ABC News that investigators are also looking into Tamerlan's contacts 
with a young militant named Mahmud Mansur Nidal.

The
two were reportedly seen leaving a controversial Salafist mosque in the
capital of Makhachkala that has been popular with militants over the 
years.

They also want to know about possible 
contacts with a Canadian-Russian militant named William Plonikov, who 
was killed in a police shootout last July, just days before Tamerlan 
suddenly left the country.

The body of Tamerlan Tsarnaev was entombed in an unknown gravesite yesterday after police said an anonymous person stepped forward to help arrange the secret burial.

The burial ended a weeklong search for a place willing to take Tsarnaev's body out of Worcester, where his remains had been stored at a funeral home amid protests.

In that time, the cities where Tsarnaev lived and died and his mother's country all refused the remains.

Amid the frustration, Worcester's police chief urged an end to the quandary.

'We are not barbarians,' he said. 'We bury the dead.'

By Thursday, police announced: 'As a result of our public appeal for help, a courageous and compassionate individual came forward to provide the assistance needed to properly bury the deceased.'
