Winter is coming. And with it, the return of the hi-vis ball to the Premier League.

With a chill in the air and the clocks going back, all ten of this weekend's Premier League ties, kicking off with West Ham vs Manchester City on Saturday lunchtime, will be using the new yellow and purple Nike Ordem Hi-Vis ball.

The white Ordem ball was first introduced at the start of this season and, according to Rafael E. Ortega, Nike’s Global Product Manager for Football, it was the result of more than six years’ work.

It's official name is the Nike Ordem Hi-Vis ball and it will be used throughout the winter

'The ball has been six years in the making, taking a lot of engineering work and validation,' Ortega told premierleague.com. 'It is the first fuse-welded football. It consists of 12 fuse-welded panels in a three-layer casing system, and a poly-blend wrapped, free-floating carbon latex bladder.'

For winter, the colour of the ball and the graphic detail on it are altered to maximize its visibility in darker conditions. And Ortega believes the new Nike ball will help top Premier League stars in those conditions.

'Studies have shown that that 70 per cent of matches played from October to February are under heavy clouds, rain and/or in the dark and under floodlights,' Ortega says. 'We tested what players look for, and of their vision, only 10-15 per cent is used for direct vision, the rest is peripheral.

'They are not always looking at the ball but need to find it in their peripheral vision quickly. So with the dark background of the crowds, the green grass and the bright perimeter boards we asked, "How do you make this ball stand out in this environment?"

'The colour that contrasts best was yellow. Then we found that the colour on the ball best for the players to see fastest how the ball is behaving, whether it is spinning and how fast was purple.

'So that was how we came to have the ball emblazoned with Nike’s RaDaR, or Rapid Decision and Response, technology. The graphic pattern, which is unique to each league, creates a flickering effect as the ball rotates.'
