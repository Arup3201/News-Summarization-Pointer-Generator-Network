A new mother has claimed she almost died when she collapsed with part of the placenta still in her womb.

Megan Hubbard began haemorrhaging in a restaurant two weeks after giving birth to baby George last month.

Miss Hubbard had returned five times to Queen Elizabeth Hospital in Woolwich where she had given birth to complain of heavy bleeding, but was told it was 'normal'.

Megan Hubbard, with partner Dan Hunter, claims she almost died when she collapsed with part of the placenta still in her womb after giving birth to her son George

The 23-year-old, of Thamesmead, south London, said that despite having a normal birth she experienced a lot of bleeding after returning home.

She said: 'I went back to the hospital five times and they sent me home each time saying "it’s normal to bleed after having a baby"'.

On September 24 Miss Hubbard returned to the hospital’s accident and emergency department concerned about the bleeding.

She claims she was told she had a womb infection and discharged with antibiotics.

Later that day, the mother-of-one visited a restaurant to celebrate the birth of her son with her family.

As she finished her dinner she suddenly collapsed due to a haemorrhage, she says caused by placenta being left in her womb.

She says she lost three-and-a-half litres of blood in the incident and required a blood transfusion when she arrived at hospital.

Miss Hubbard was told the heavy bleeding she was experiencing was 'normal'

Normally, the placenta separates from the uterine wall during delivery and is expelled from the vagina within 20 minutes after giving birth.

If pieces of the placenta remain in the uterus (called retained placenta), it can lead to infection.

If haemorrhage begins a week or two after delivery, it may be caused by a piece of the placenta that has remained in the uterus. If so, the tissue will be removed surgically.

Miss Hubbard said: 'What really scares me is that I could have been in the car with my son when it happened.

'The hospital has failed me - they said it was a womb infection and I nearly lost my life from it. I've still had no apology from them.'

She added that the time spent in hospital recovering from the haemorrhage had caused been incredibly traumatic.

'I was away from my baby quite a bit in those two weeks because I was really weak and had no strength at all. 

'It stopped me bonding with him.'

Miss Hubbard has written to the head of midwifery at the hospital to complain about what happened and is considering taking legal action.

She praised the staff at the Toby Carvery restaurant, who had called for help immediately.

'They did an amazing job and an off-duty nurse got me breathing more strongly until the ambulance arrived.

'I want to thank them and to say how disgusted I am with Queen Elizabeth Hospital.'

A South London Healthcare Trust spokesman said: 'We are investigating the circumstances around the care and treatment of Ms Hubbard.

'The Trust has spoken to her this week and we are making progress with looking into whether there are any aspects of her care which should have been done differently.'
