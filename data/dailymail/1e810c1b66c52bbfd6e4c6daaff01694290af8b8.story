Almost one in 10 people claiming the dole is not British, latest figures reveal.

As David Cameron prepares to go to war with Brussels over access to benefits, officials admit Poles are the biggest recipients of Jobseekers Allowance.

But thousands of the 142,300 foreign nationals receiving out-of-work payments are from outside the EU, with huge numbers on the dole from Pakistan, Somalia and Iran.

Claimants: Official figures show how tens of thousands of foreign nationals are on benefits in the UK

The Prime Minister has clashed with the European Commission over his claims that Britain’s benefits system is a ‘pull factor’ in attracting people to move here.

Latest figures show that in February 9.2 per cent of all Jobseekers Allowance claimants were non-UK nationals.

It includes 35,000 from the EU, 35,000 from Africa, 33,000 from Asia and the Middle East and 6,500 from the Americas.

Poland tops the league table with 14,610 JSA claimants, followed by Pakistan 7,660, Somalia 7,120 and Portugal 5,860.

It also included 4,130 Iraqis, 3,620 Nigerians, 3,290 Jamaicans and 3,120 from France.

A major political row erupted this 
week when a report from the European Commission revealed there were 
600,000 foreigners from the EU in Britain without a job.

Downing Street seized on the figures as proof of the impact on benefits and public services of an influx of people not earning money and paying tax.

Talks: David Cameron today briefed the Cabinet on his negotiations with the EU, and areas of red tape he wants to cut

There was a 73 per cent increase in 
the number of ‘job-seeking’ EU immigrants in the country in the three 
years to 2011, according to the Commission.

The findings led Boris Johnson to urge the Prime Minister to demand a change in EU laws to delay migrants’ access to benefits.

Mr Johnson said migrants should have to work for ‘quite a long time’ before they can claim any benefits in this country.

In
 response, Number 10 suggested the right of people from across Europe 
could be curtailed under Mr Cameron's plans to overhaul Britain's 
relationship with Brussels.

The
 Prime Minister has drawn up a 'battleplan' for talks with other EU 
countries in which he wants to claw back powers over who can move to 
Britain, find work and claim benefits.

Mr Cameron is already under pressure 
to urged to slash benefits and access to public services for immigrants 
from Europe, but Downing Street suggested he could go further.

Asked if the government was now 
examining ways to curb the freedom of movement rules - allowing people 
from anywhere in the EU to settle in Britain - Downing Street confirmed 
it was on the table.

Mr Cameron's official spokesman said: 'I think it is understandable that in the UK and a number of other countries, questions are being asked in this area.

'We have a programme underway, bilateral discussions with other member states. It is not right to pre-empt that now.'
