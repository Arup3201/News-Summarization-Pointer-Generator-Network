His behaviour on this year's Celebrity Big Brother has been the talk of the nation.

And now Lee Ryan's Blue bandmate Duncan James has opened up about the singer's philandering with both glamour model Casey Batchelor and US actress Jasmine Waltz inside the house.

Speaking exclusively to MailOnline, Duncan said he believes that Lee is still entirely unaware of how he is coming across on screen.

Opening up: Duncan James has spoken exclusively to MailOnline about Lee Ryan's actions inside the Celebrity Big Brother house

He said: 'The thing about Lee is, and no disrespect
 to him, he's not a player in the sense that he's calculating, playing 
somebody at a game because he's not that smart to think that, in that 
respect. He just goes with what he feels. And in his head he probably 
didn't think he was doing anything wrong. In his head he probably 
thought, "Oh well, I've been handcuffed to this girl Casey and she's 
really sweet and we had a little kiss and a cuddle", and in his head 
that's normal, that's fine.

'But his d**k is probably telling him , "Oh 
that Jasmine, she's really fit, I really like that one", but I
 think his heart is more in with Casey and his d**k is more thinking 
about Jasmine if I'm honest. But he's a typical lad like that. I think 
Jasmine's the kind of girl that he'd want to take out and have lots of 
dirty sex with, and Casey's the kind of girl that he could take home to 
his mum and kiss and cuddle in the morning.'

Duncan also insisted that Casey isn't doing 
herself any favours by 'playing the victim' when it comes to Lee, and is
 portraying herself as something of a 'bunny boiler'.

Can't make up his mind: Duncan said Lee is 'thinking with his d**k when it comes to Jasmine and his heart with Casey'

He said: 'Casey,
 she's acting like a bunny boiler if I must say so myself. And she must 
have known what Lee is like, all you have to do is Google Lee Ryan and 
see what he's been like in the past. She's not that dumb - she's a 
26-year-old girl and I'm sure she's heard about Lee Ryan before.

'And I'm
 sure she's read many many stories about what he's like. So don't be 
playing the victim and say, "Oh, I really like you". I just think you're
 a grown woman, you're not a child, you should be in control of your 
emotions at that age and know... And then for her to go back into that 
botlhole and be like, "Oh I've got no knickers on, how do I kiss, do I 
kiss good?"

'Selling out': Duncan also spoke about Lee's ex Sammi Miller selling her story on him this weekend

'It's like, come on girl, you know what you're doing, you 
know what you're playing. So don't make out that you're this poor 
heartbroken victim and then go in the toilets and kiss him again - you 
just make yourself look stupid.'

Duncan added that Lee entering the house alongside both Jasmine and Casey has seen him act like a 'kid in a sweetshop', but also revealed that it has been frustrating to watch his bandmate's actions in the house so far.

He said: 'Seeing him in the house, really liking 
this Jasmine girl and getting into bed with Casey, it's just a bit like,
 "Oh God Lee, come on mate!" It's frustrating for me to watch him 
because I'm like, "Come on mate, you're 30 now, you've got a couple of 
kids, you don't need to be... " But he wears his heart on his sleeve, he
 gets into the moment and he thinks that he's in love so quickly - he 
just wants desperately to meet somebody and be happy, because he has had
 really difficult times in his last relationships and he just wants to 
meet someone know and be happy, because he's at that age now where he 
really wants that.

'But in that Big Brother house he's like a kid in a 
sweetshop, it's like, what sweet do you go for? And you're in a surreal 
surroundings in a house with people that you've never met and you're all
 thrown together and it's just a really bizarre experience I can only 
imagine.'

Duncan's comments about Lee's actions in the house come as he revealed the real reason for the singer making the decision to take part in the show - to raise money to put his children, son Rain and daughter Blubelle, through private education.

Duncan explained: 'Lee's always wanted to have that 
family where the mum and dad are together and it's unity and security 
within the household. And Lee was taken around various different 
schools, got kicked out of various schools, was bullied because he was 
dyslexic, he didn't feel that he had the education that he needed 
because a lot of people misunderstood him and he was thrown out rather 
than being helped. And because of the fact that he was dyslexic as a 
kid, he was bullied with people calling him thick, and he had a really 
really hard time as a kid doing that.

'So for him, the most important 
thing is that his children don't go through the same pattern that he 
went through. And I think that he's always wanted to make sure his kids 
have a great education, they're taught the best way, and they don't have
 to be bullied or tormented because they may have an impairment like 
dyslexia and that kind of stuff. For Lee, it's important that he 
puts his kids through good eduction and they're having a good schooling 
because he doesn't want history to repeat itself.

Motivated: Duncan said Lee doesn't want Rain and his daughter Blubelle to have the same school life he did

'So for Lee, that is 
why he was so adamant about doing this, because his kids are at an age 
where they're about to start school and he just wants the best for his 
children. And I completely understand that because my daughter's eight, 
and I got her into an amazing grammar school and now it looks like she's
 going to be getting into the Royal Ballet School. I think as a parent, 
it's important to give your kids the best start in life and that is 
second to none for Lee - he wants that more than anything.'

Duncan's interview with MailOnline came after Sammi Miller, the mother of Lee's five-year-old son Rain, slammed the singer for encouraging the little boy to tune in to his raunchy antics on the show.

She was quoted as saying: 'What kind of father tells his five-year-old to watch him on TV and then behaves like a porn star?'

But Duncan insisted that while Lee was fully prepared for stories to come out when he was in the house, the fact that his ex has sold out on him will still be devastating for him.

He said: 'He was always prepared that stories were 
going to hit when he went in the house. And that was one of the things 
that he actually was worried about and I knew that he was concerned 
about certain people selling out on him, but the fact of the matter is, 
I've been in a similar situation to Lee.

'I've got a daughter which I'm 
not in a relationship with the mother but even still, the mother of my 
child would never sell out on me, because our child would have to see 
that. It doesn't matter how old she is, she's going to grow up and see 
that, and it's like, why would Mummy and Daddy do that to each other and
 air each other's dirty laundry for all the world to see - that should 
be private, that should be between you two.

'And I know because of the 
conversations I have with Claire, who is the mother of my child, that we
 are like, we would never do that to each other, to harm our child. But I
 think unfortunately, certain people that Lee's been involved with don't
 think that way. And that's very sad to me because I have a completely 
different ethos and I know Lee does as well - Lee's the kind of person 
that would never spill dirt on something that's so private like his 
family.

'And it's just very sad that in the past there has been stories 
and I'm sure there are going to be more stories coming out and that 
breaks my heart more than anything, because it's about the children here
 and people forget that. The kids need to be put first, in all respects,
 for everything.

'It's like, you don't sell out on somebody for money
 because it's like you're selling your kid, and it's completely 
disgusting and wrong. But that's my own personal view.'
