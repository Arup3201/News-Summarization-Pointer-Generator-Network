Guilty: Millionaire playboy Jason Moore is facing jail after he was convicted of murdering Robert Darby in a row over a woman

A professional gambler who stabbed his jealous 'stalker' through the heart in a dispute over a woman before fleeing the country has been convicted of murder.

Millionaire playboy Jason Moore, 43, attacked Robert Darby outside a pub in 2005 and then went on the run until last year when he gave himself in to police.

In a prepared statement given to officers Moore described 42-year-old Mr Darby as a ‘telephone terrorist’ and a Jekyll-and-Hyde character.

Moore, who was living in a £1.4m apartment in Canary Wharf at the time of the killing, claimed the victim had threatened to chop his toes off.

He said he recruited friend Martin Power, 47, to help resolve the dispute over Mr Darby’s ex-girlfriend Adele Raynor and did not plan to use any violence.

However, Moore was unanimously convicted of murdering Mr Darby outside the Valentine pub in Gants Hill, east London, in August 2005.

He was led screaming to the cells, violently kicking the dock and threatening a police officer.

Moore’s family shouted insults at the same officer, ignoring warning from the Common Serjeant of London, Judge Nicholas Hilliard, to remain silent.

Power was acquitted of murder by the jury.

Mr Darby was described as an ‘intimidating individual’ who was obsessively stalking Moore and Ms Raynor.

Ms Raynor, 35, who had had an on-off relationship with Mr Darby had earlier told the Old Bailey he had a ‘very explosive’ temper and his use of cocaine made him ‘erratic’.

The pair met in the 1990s  when she was a teenager and he was in his 30s and had an on-and-off relationship that lasted until 2004.

‘There were quite a lot of arguments, his temper was very explosive,' said Ms Rayner.

‘He was just all over the place, very kind of not stable sometimes.

Focus: Adele Raynor had an on-off relationship with Mr Darby, before she started seeing Moore

‘He was just always on the go, very much up and down.’

Ms Rayner said she ended things between them because he was controlling and domineering.

‘All the time he had mood swings, one minute he was laughing and joking and the next minute he was punching someone’s lights out,’ she said.

‘He never actually hit me but there was some violent incidents.

‘I had had enough, he didn’t take it very well.

Victim: Robert Darby, 42, was stabbed in the chest with such force that the knifed passed straight through a rib and into his heart

‘He was quite controlling and if he wasn’t in control there was a problem and he started to lose control of the situation because I didn’t want to be with him any more.’

She said she met Moore the following year and starting seeing him while Mr Darby was travelling in Australia.

She had called police after Mr Darby threatened her on the morning of August 24, 2005, just hours before the fatal confrontation outside the Valentine pub in Gants Hill.

Mr Darby, from Poplar, London, was stabbed in the chest with such force that the knifed passed straight through a rib and into his heart.

He collapsed within a few minutes and died in hospital the following day from the injury.

Moore said the dispute started after he began a short relationship with Adele, who he met in Bar 38 underneath his apartment.

‘He phoned me and for the first time threatened me. he was saying things like ‘I have got no family I can do what I like. I’m going to chop your toes off and if you go anywhere near Adele again I am going to kill you,’ he said.

‘His behaviour was irrational. He was a nuisance but at the same time I took seriously the threats he was making. I chose to ignore him as best as I could.’

Moore added: ‘In my view Robert Darby was a complete Jekyll and Hyde character. You couldn’t predict how he was going to behave.’

Power told the court he had been knocked senseless after the victim ‘clumped’ him over the head with a Stanley knife.

‘I didn’t see any knife, he was screaming at me and I said ‘just calm yourself down,’ he said.

‘As I was going towards him the next thing I knew I got a clump on the head which I now know was with a Stanley knife.

‘I was knocked senseless, I had a golf ball on my head and a big graze.’

Power was arrested in Malaga, Spain, in April and extradited to stand trial in the UK while Moore turned himself in late last year.

Moore, of no fixed address will be sentenced on Monday 23 December.
