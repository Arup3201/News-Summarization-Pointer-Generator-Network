A  researcher's accidental discovery could pave the way for a baldness cure by harnessing the power of white blood cells.

The cancer expert was testing anti-inflammatory drugs on mice when she was surprised to discover they were growing extra fur, so investigated what was causing the phenomenon.

She discovered it was due to macrophages, which are derived from white blood cells called monocytes and are produced by the immune system to fight infections and clear up dead tissue.

Wait no more: Hopes for a baldness cure have been revived after a Spanish researcher accidentally discovered how cells from the immune system can activate those which are responsible for hair growth

According to Dr Mirna Perez-Moreno, who made the find at the Spanish National Cancer Research Centre in Madrid, the macrophages activated nearby stem cells which are responsible for hair growth.

That means follicles could be encouraged to grow without the need for a hair transplant, which can cost upwards of £5,000.

She and the study's other authors wrote in the journal PLOS Biology: 'One of the current challenges in the stem cell field is... to promote regeneration without the need of transplantation.

'Because of this study, it is now known that macrophages play a key role in the environment surrounding stem cells.

'Our study underlines the importance of macrophages as modulators in skin regenerative processes, going beyond their primary function as phagocytic immune cells.'

Previous research has identified signals from the skin that help prompt hair growth, but exactly how different types of cells do this continues to stir debate.

The study's authors believe their findings could also influence approaches to tissue regeneration, ageing and cancer.

Dr Perez-Moreno made the discovery by accident while she was working on another research project.

She observed that the mice she was working with had started to regrow hair when they were given anti-inflammatory drugs.

Curious as to whether  communication between stem cells and immune cells could be the cause, her lab tested several immune system cells to see if they had any influence.

They found that some macrophage cells activated nearby stem cells and hair began to grow again.

They then tested the theory by treating the mice with a drug which suppressed the main signals sent out by macrophages - and found that the growth was delayed. 

Although the study was carried out in mice, the researchers believe their discovery may enable the development of new treatments for hair growth in humans.

Their method of using tiny droplets called liposomes to carry the drug to specific cells could be repeated, they added.

Half of all British men suffer from baldness by the time they reach the age of 50, with many going to great lengths to disguise the change.

That is despite several 'bald pride' movements and no shortage of celebrities who proudly show off their bare heads - including Bruce Willis, Samuel L Jackson and Sean Connery.
