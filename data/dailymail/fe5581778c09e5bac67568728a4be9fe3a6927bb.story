Health officials say 14 states now have respiratory illnesses caused by an uncommon virus — enterovirus 68 which is marked by severe breathing problems and will continue to infect children in more states.

Centers for Disease Control and Prevention officials say Alabama, Colorado, Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Kansas, Kentucky, Louisiana, Missouri, New York, Oklahoma and Pennsylvania together have 130 lab-confirmed cases. 

As of Wednesday both Minnesota and New Jersey also have confirmed cases of the severe virus.

Sweeping the nation: This map shows 12 or the 14 confirmed states (not including Minnesota and New Jersey) where enterovirus D 68 has caused a surge of severe respiratory disease 

 A child in Minnesota is confirmed to have the virus and hospitals in the region have been flooded with children complaining of serious breathing difficulties.

The Star Tribune reports that The Children’s hospitals in Minneapolis and St. Paul have been averaging a combined total of around 300 children transferred to inpatient care each day for the past week.

An entire fourth of those children are suffering respiratory problems and were right to seek hospitalization, says Children’s chief nursing officer Roxanne Fernandes.

'One little boy about 6 years old told me it was like having an elephant sitting on his chest,” Fernandez said.

'And so when you’re having that much trouble breathing, we really want you to be here,' she added.

The New York Daily News reports that a case of the virus has been confirmed in New Jersey on Wednesday. The child's condition has since improved after being discharged from the hospital.

There are also suspected cases in Georgia, Michigan, Ohio and Utah.

So far all those with confirmed cases are children.

1.Avoid sharing objects such as utensils, cups, and bottles.

2.Cover your mouth and nose with a tissue when you cough or sneeze and wash your hands afterwards. If tissue-less, cough or sneeze into your elbow or upper arm, not into your hands.

3.Keep your hands away from your eyes, nose and mouth to keep germs from entering your body.

4.Proper and consistent hand washing is one of the easiest ways to prevent the spread of flu. 

Teach kids by example by showing them proper hand washing technique:

Wet hands with water and apply an amount of soap recommended by the manufacturer to hands.

Rub hands together vigorously for at least 20 seconds, covering all surfaces of the hands and giving added attention to fingernails and surfaces where jewelry is worn.

Rinse hands with water.

Dry thoroughly with a disposable towel.

Use towel to turn off faucet.

 

The virus can cause mild to severe illness, with the worst cases needing life support for breathing difficulties. Kids with asthma have been especially vulnerable. 

No deaths have been reported thus far.

The strain is not new but only a small number of labs can test for it. Since mid-August, there's been an unusual spike in identified cases.

The CDC has tested more than 200 specimens from more than 30 states.

Investigators say it's not yet clear what triggered the outbreak or whether it's worsening.

The Washington Post reports that enteroviruses are very common and cause between 10 million and 15 million infections every year.

The particular strain enterovirus 68 hasn't appeared very often since it was first isolated in California in 1962.

Anne Schuchat, director of the CDC’s National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases, told reporters that most enterovirus infections in the United States occur in the summertime and in the fall.

She expects that the number of viruses to drop later in the year.

In order to prevent transmission of the virus children should practice proper hand-washing and should cover their mouths and nose when coughing or sneezing.

Another way of preventing disease is by strengthening the immune system by eating a balanced diet, drinking lots of fluids, exercising daily, managing stress, and getting enough sleep, according to The Red Cross via WIBV.com.
