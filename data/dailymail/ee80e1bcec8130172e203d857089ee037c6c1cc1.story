After a drawn-out divorce, most women could be forgiven for not feeling entirely charitable towards their ex.

But one author channelled her feelings about the end of her own marriage into a slightly more extreme form of therapy – writing the story of a woman who decides to kill and eat her husband.

Natalie Young penned Season To Taste after being inspired by the break-up of her ten-year marriage to Peter, the father of her two children.

Natalie Young's new book, Season To Taste, tells the story of a middle-aged woman who decides to cut up and eat her husband of 30 years. It is set to be one of the most controversial talked about books of 2014

The macabre novel tells the story  of fiftysomething Lizzie, who decides to kill her husband Jacob after 30  years of marriage.

To
save wasting the body, Lizzie also decides to cut it up into 16 pieces –
each of which gets bagged, labelled and stored in the freezer before 
being cooked and eaten.

Miss
Young, 37, confirmed that the novel drew on her own experiences, 
although she took care to point out that she never actually considered 
eating her ex.

She told the 
Mail: ‘With two children to raise on your own it is unbelievably 
difficult. You have to deal with the guilt and explain why you left 
daddy.

The novel, Ms Young's second, is published by Tinder Press, part of Hodder, and is released next month

‘This book was a way 
of unconsciously depicting an extreme aspect of that very traumatic 
experience. It was a way of exploring the extreme repercussion of 
separation and divorce.’

She
added: ‘It is all too easy to break up without grieving, and this was 
about the grieving process that occurs when a marriage breaks up – an 
artistic experience of cannibalism.’

While
it may not seem like the most humorous of tales, she revealed that, 
astonishingly, her ex-husband managed to see the funny side of the 
situation.

Miss Young said: ‘Obviously he sees that it came out of our experience. But he thinks that it is really funny.’

Perhaps
unsurprisingly, her darkly humorous interpretation of a marriage 
break-up has received mixed reviews from her close group of friends. The
former magazine editor said most of her male friends were horrified by 
the concept.

However, she 
was encouraged by the fact that the majority of her female friends were 
hugely supportive, with some even giving her a round of applause when 
she first revealed the idea.

‘People love it because it is so real,’ she said. ‘They are reading something utterly disgusting but it is a very human story.

‘It
is very Waitrose, there’s lots of olive oil and salt, she’s got clean 
tea towels, and it cuts through into our escapist fantasies. It is not a
bloodbath, it is an emotional and artistic exploration of someone’s 
marriage.’

While filled with
black humour, Miss Young stressed that the novel – which is due to be 
published next month – still has a serious point to make.

She
said: ‘So many women  are trapped in relationships. I do believe women 
give more to a relationship than men do. It is in our nature to be 
incredibly giving once you have children.

‘Women
in relationships are  so often trying to please men and we allow 
ourselves to be exploited and devoured. Killing and then eating or 
devouring can be revenge.’
