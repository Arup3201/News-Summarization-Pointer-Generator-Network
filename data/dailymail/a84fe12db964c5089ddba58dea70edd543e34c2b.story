Real Madrid's £328million plans to redevelop their Santiago Bernabéu  have yet another snag after a ruling by the High Court of Madrid overturned the approval of plans that included updates to the stadium.

Club president Florentino Perez revealed the vision for the new  Bernabeu to be 'the best stadium in the world' last January along with mock-ups for the 400million euro works. 

The three-year project would include a revamped exterior, a retractable roof and increase its capacity to 85,454 to 90,000, along with a hotel and shopping centre complex alongside, but Tuesday's ruling has put a spanner in the works.

'The High Court of Madrid has overturned the Agreement from 15 November 2012, issued by the Community of Madrid's Governing Council, which approved the Specific Modification of the Madrid General Development Plan, a decision that affects the Santiago Bernabéu,' a statement on the Real Madrid website read.

'Following this ruling, Real Madrid C. F. will work with the City Council and the Community of Madrid to address those aspects that require attention in order to make the Santiago Bernabéu reform project viable.'

It's another blow to Real this week after Spanish paper AS labelled the club as in crisis with Perez reportedly demanding his players 'return to the Madrid you were before.'

Carlo Ancelotti's side were given a 4-0 lesson at rival Atletico Madrid's Vicente Calderon on Saturday, with goals from Tiago Mendes, Saul Niguez, Antoine Griezmann and Mario Mandzukic.

A club statement said Real would 'address those aspects that require attention in order to make the Santiago Bernabeu reform project viable after the High Courts overturning of development approval 

Perez said at the unveiling of the plans in January last year: 'It's time to face another challenge has come, we want to make the Santiago Bernabeu is the best stadium in the world.

'Our commitment is to continue increasing the heritage of our club, thus gain in economic strength, so we can continue to lead in an environment of increasing competition.

'We believe in a project that will enhance our image, brand and city that we also feel proud of.'

The project was previously stalled in August due to European Commission investigation into allegations of illegal state aid.

The court statement read: 'The court is adopting the (suspension) measure due to the launching of a process by the European Commission relating to possible state aid given to Real Madrid.' 

Volkwin Marg, owner of GMP, who will lead the project, said: '(We aim to) transform the Bernabeu into the most advanced and developed stadium of the 21st century. This building is undoubtedly the most important project of our careers.'
