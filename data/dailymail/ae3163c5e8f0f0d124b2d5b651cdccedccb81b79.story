The US army has demolished thousands of buildings at a US army base in Afghanistan, as the military ends its war in the region.

The demolition  is taking place at Bagram airfield, one of the largest US bases in the country, located 50 km north of Kabul.

Bagram has 1,800 temporary buildings which have all been destroyed this year, in a bid to stop the Taliban using any of its contents after the troops withdraw.

The US military has already removed much of the power supply, torn out fixtures by hand, and used mechanical diggers to destroy the roofs on buildings at the airfield.

The operation comes as the massive NATO-led fighting force pulls out of the region after more than a decade on the ground fighting the Taliban.

The wooden offices and dormitories being destroyed are a part of buildings that were hurriedly erected at Bagram.

The buildings housed troops who first arrived in the country after 2001  when the US sent an extra 30,000 soldiers in the 2010 'surge'.

At the height of the war, 130,000 international troops were fighting in Afghanistan.

But combat operations will finish at the end of the year and only 12,500 soldiers will remain into 2015 on a training and support mission.

'This is definitely a full-time job for us,' US Staff Sergeant Zach Smith, head of one of the demolition teams at Bagram said.

'Part of the process is removing all the interior rooms and electrical components and separating them so they can be properly disposed of.'

Soldiers wearing yellow hardhats use crowbars and hammers to dismantle the vacated buildings that once housed desks, computers and bunk-beds.

The work is fast but painstaking as material is sifted into different components for recycling or disposal, ensuring that no electrical items or other potential bomb-making kit can fall into Taliban hands.

'We absolutely do that in the most environmentally-conscious way that we possibly can,' Smith said.

'Whenever there is fuel, oil, batteries, we dispose of those things to ensure that we leave Bagram the way we found it.' 

The splintered remains of each building are scooped into dumper trucks that make endless journeys back and forth to a tipping site on the edge of the base.

Dubbed Mount Trash-more after Mount Rushmore -- the US mountain carved into the faces of former presidents -- the dump is opened to Afghan companies who salvage what they can from the debris.

Lieutenant Wes Vermillion, who oversees the project said: 'Right now we've taken down about 1,800 temporary structures that were either living space or offices.'

He said more than 2,000 buildings will be destroyed by December, with a final 500 torn down by contractors next year after the US military engineers have left.

But as the base shrinks, it is also a hub for the retrograde operation to remove weapons, equipment and vehicles from Afghanistan as troops draw in from the provinces.

Colonel Stephanie Gradford is behind Bagram's adaption to its rapidly changing role.

She said: 'We have a lot of folks coming in from other bases that we're sending home'

'We are retrograding equipment in preparation (for the NATO support mission) and preparing Bagram to be turned over, at some point in the next couple of years, to the Afghans.'

Cargo aircraft loaded with gear and troops wait on the runway to leave the country, while elsewhere Afghan teams scour the site of a demolished canteen, even picking up spare nails left on the ground.

Rest: 'This is definitely a full-time job,' US Staff Sergeant Zach Smith, head of one of the demolition teams said

Bagram's permanent buildings and roads are being kept for the US forces that will still be deployed next year, and then for the Afghan military that will be left to thwart any Taliban resurgence.

In 2001, about 30,000 foreign soldiers and civilians were housed at the former Soviet base, but the number is down to 15,000 today and will be cut to 6,000 US troops next year.

By the end of 2016, the only US military presence in Afghanistan will be at the embassy in Kabul.

The reality that, after 13 years of war, the US military's vast apparatus is on its way out is only just sinking in even for the soldiers themselves, according to Colonel Gradford.

'They want to see the mission through, so it's tough even getting military people to understand that we are changing,' she said.
