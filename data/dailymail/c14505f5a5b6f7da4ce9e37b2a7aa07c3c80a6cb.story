George Jung, the heavyweight cocaine smuggler who inspired the Johnny Depp film 'Blow', has been released from prison.

The 71-year-old walked free today following a nearly 20-year stint at FCI Fort Dix in New Jersey, according to TMZ. He will live in a West Coast half-way house as he adjusts to life on the outside.

The ex-drugs boss, originally due for release in November this year, was responsible for more than 85 percent of the cocaine smuggled into America in the 1970s and 1980s.

He has been behind bars since 1994 when he was caught with 1,754 pounds of cocaine in Kansas.

He pleaded guilty to three counts of 
conspiracy, and received a 60-year sentence.

His sentence, however, was 
reduced after he testified in the trial of his long-term business partner, Carlos Ledher.

'I was a guy who had a lot of money and unlimited access to cocaine and even if I looked like Bela Lugosi I still had the most beautiful women on the planet because everybody at that time, especially women, were in love with cocaine and of course in love with the money – the access to the automobiles, the clothes, the dinners, the lifestyle,' he told PBS in 2000.

'Basically I was no different than a rock star or a movie star. I was a coke star.'

Nicknamed 'Boston George' after the Massachusetts city in which he was born, Jung first entered the drug underworld in the 1960s selling marijuana.

He was sent to prison in 1974 for smuggling 660 pounds of marijuana, and while inside met Carlos Ledher who facilitated his entry into cocaine trafficking. 

Lehder introduced Jung to the Medellín Cartel, and Jung taught Lehder how to smuggle. The two earned millions of dollars together.

During his latest stint in jail, Jung met with Johnny Depp who portrayed him in the 2001 cult classic, 'Blow'. 

'It’s
 very rare in life that any person opens up their heart and soul to you 
with unlimited access to their most profound thoughts, dreams, fears, 
regrets, intimacies,' Depp wrote in a letter regarding that visit.

'Even more rare when you’ve just met that person 
and, because of the obvious predicament, it’s highly unlikely that you 
will be spending too much time with them in the near future. So for this and more, I owe a great debt of gratitude to George.
