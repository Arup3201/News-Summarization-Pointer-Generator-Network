Debbie Harry has said
 the junkie jazz musician linked to Philip Seymour Hoffman's fatal 
overdose is an 'asset to New York's culture.'

The
 Blondie singer and bandmate Chris Stein praise Robert Vineberg in a 
letter filed with court papers relating to his trial for possessing 
heroin with intent to sell.

Multi-instrumentalist
 Vineberg, who goes by the stage name Robert Aaron and has played with 
David Bowie, Wyclef Jean, Mick Jagger and Amy Winehouse, was arrested as
 police followed leads after Mr Hoffman's death.

'An asset to New York culture: Blondie singer Debbie Harry and bandmate Chris Stein (both pictured) praise Robert Vineberg in a letter filed with court papers relating to his trial for possessing heroin with intent to sell.

Vineberg
 has pleaded not guilty to possessing heroin with the intent to sell. He
 has not been charged with selling it or playing any role in Hoffman's death on February 2.

The
 actor was found at his home with a needle sticking out of his arm. 
Toxicology tests showed he had a mix of heroin, cocaine and other drugs 
in his body.

Vineberg was 
arrested just two days later when police swooped on his Mott Street, 
Manhattan, apartment and discovered 296 bags of heroin with a street 
value of nearly $3,000.

According
 to a police report, Vineberg, 57, said he was friendly with Hoffman 
and had occasionally sold him heroin but hadn't seen him since October.

He
 has previously spoken to the press, against the advice of his lawyer, 
to say he feels like he has been made a scapegoat for Mr Hoffman's 
sudden death.

Canadian-born 
Aaron, who faces up to 25-years if he is found guilty, was the subject 
of a sympathetic profile in the New York Times in which he was defiant 
about his heroin addiction.

'A
 lot of times you have a deadline and you have to work for 24 hours. 
This lets you do it with no pain, no tiredness,' he told New York Times 
writer John Leland.

'If I 
have to write a book, get me high — I’ll have the book written in two 
weeks. You’re lucid. And emotions don’t affect you as much — your anger —
 it bottles up your feelings.

'It makes you more rational, or you think you are, anyway. You sleep wonderfully. I’m a lifelong insomniac.'

Apparently
 wary of sounding like a cheerleader for hard drug use, he added: 
'Everything has its good points and bad points. The bad point is the 
dependence.'

Vineberg worked
 twice with Debbie Harry's band Blondie, arranging the horns and playing
 sax on their 1982 album Hunter and adding flute and sax to their 1999 
comeback No Exit.

Hoffman's publicist didn't immediately respond to an email.
