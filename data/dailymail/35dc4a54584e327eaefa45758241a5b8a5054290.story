The Welsh Rugby Union has paid tribute to former Scarlets chief executive Stuart Gallacher, who has died at the age of 68.

Gallacher, a dual Wales international in rugby union and rugby league, was also the first chief executive of Regional Rugby Wales and served on the board of European Rugby Cup.

A minute's silence was scheduled to take place during Sunday's WRU Annual General Meeting in Port Talbot.

Stuart Gallacher died peacefully at the age of 68, having dedicated much of his life to Welsh rugby

WRU group chief executive Roger Lewis said: 'Stuart dedicated his life outside his family to the game of rugby, and his contribution down the years will prove a fitting epitaph to his commitment and loyalty.

'His understanding and love for the game meant he was always able to contribute positively to important decisions which formed the road map for the development of the sport.'

And WRU president Dennis Gethin added: 'Stuart was a close friend of so many people involved in Welsh rugby, and all of us are aware of his incredible contribution to our game.

'It is rare for anyone to achieve so much both on and off the field within our game, but Stuart was an exceptional individual who gave so much.'
