The two Indian sisters who were filmed hitting two men with a belt after allegedly being sexually harassed today revealed that they fought back to show that 'girls are not weak'.

Pooja, 19, and Aarti Kumar, 22, were verbally abused by three men in their early 20s on a bus in Rohtak, Haryana, last Friday - and have since become internet heroines for their retaliation.

The university students, who were on their way home from Rohtak Government College, turned on their abusers - and beat them up with a belt while fellow passengers watched.

Hitting back: Sisters Pooja, 19, left, and Aarti, 22, right, were filmed beating up a group of men who were verbally and physically abusing them on a bus in Rohtak, a district in the northern state of Haryana

Today, Pooja told MailOnline: ‘We encounter these kinds of incidents on a daily basis. It was only when the boys started misbehaving with a pregnant woman that we resorted to this.

‘We really thought to these guys a lesson and beat them up. We wanted to show that we girls are not weak and capable to defending ourselves. We really wanted to kick them.

‘After they got beaten they ran away, otherwise they would have continued to harass us. I am not regretting it. I did the right thing.’

The three men, from Asan village in Rohtak, had initially attempted to flirt with the sisters by giving out his phone number on a piece of paper, but things turned sinister when they refused him. 

A video of the bus attack has gone viral on social media in India, and has since seen the men arrested

When Aarti told the men to stop and not touch her, one of the men pushed her and grabbed her by the throat.

Coming to her sister's defence, Pooja removed her belt and began hitting, kicking and punching the man holding her sister until he let go.

Pooja said: ‘You see we have been tolerating these kind of things for long enough, but how long can we tolerate this?

‘Our patience was over when we saw a fellow lady passenger who was pregnant being abused and bullied by these hooligans than we decided to act and teach them a lesson.’

The incident took place on a bus on Friday, when the Kumar sisters were on their way home from Rohtak Government College, and was filmed by one of the passengers 

‘Women get harassed and abused everywhere in India and men haven’t learnt any lessons even after so many incidents. Every man has a mother and sister, but they still indulge in these things.’

Most of the passengers did nothing to help the girls, and neither driver not the bus conductor stepped in.

The film of the incident, which has been circulating on social media, shows one man attempting to separate the girls from the three men.

The victims even dialled the number of a women's helpline, but got no response.

The Kumar sisters say they were 'thrown off the bus' by their abusers, who followed them and continued to harass them.

Pooja told local media that they finally fought off the trio by throwing a brick at them, after which they fled the scene.

After reaching home, the sisters narrated the incident to their parents and subsequently a case was registered at the Rohtak Sadar police station.

The three men, said to be soldiers-in-training, have been arrested over the attack. Today, the bus conductor and driver were both suspended for allegedly not informing the police about the incident.

Haryana Women's Commission vice-chairperson Suman Dahiya said: 'I will personally visit the place where the incident took place.' 

A women-only taxi business in India's capital New Delhi, may have to close after its main customer, a government-run women's advice helpline, have failed to  pay them for six months.

The Sakha Cabs project was set up in the Indian capital New Delhi in 2010 with just two drivers offering to carry only female passengers who were nervous about travelling with male cab drivers.

But the project expanded rapidly when they got a contract to transport female employees from a government run helpline called 'Women in Distress'.

At risk: The Sakha Cabs project was set up in New Delhi in 2010 to carry only female passengers but may now have to close down after drivers have not been paid for six months

However, the cab company say they may have to close up shop, as the government-run helpline has not paid them.

Sakha Cabs director Nayantara Janardhan said: 'The staff operating the helpline offer advice to women with all sorts of problems, and after a day's work they don't want to be driven home by a man. 

'They want to be driven home by woman and know that they can relax and enjoy the journey and that they will be delivered safely.'

But she said the cash shortfall was causing severe problems, and said many of her female drivers had had to take out loans in order to get by in recent months after the company ran out of money because it was not being paid by the regional government run project in New Delhi.

Janardhan added: 'We really feel we are providing a valuable service, but it can't go on operating as a free charity. We have bills to pay too.'

Many of the women are dependent on the job to support families.

One female driver, called Khushi, is a 23-year-old resident of Gautampuri slum which is near Badarpur, an area in a southern district of New Dehli.

She said: 'My father was a labourer and stopped working after I started earning. His health isn't good. My salary helps me put my three younger sisters and a brother through school.'
