Twisted college students who held a Labrador upside down and allegedly forced it to drink from a beer keg before posting the picture on Twitter have been charged with torture.

Shane Oliver, a 20-year-old student at the College at Brockport, State University of New York (S.U.N.Y), was pictured holding the black dog up by its hind legs on Saturday night.

Robert Yates, 20, the friend who took the picture before posting it on to SUNY Party Stories - a social media page dedicated to pictures taken at State University of New York parties - has also been charged.

Both men are students at The College at Brockport, part of the State University of New York.

Labrador Mya was allegedly held upside down by a S.U.N.Y student before he forced her to drink from a keg. The picture was then posted on social media

The photo of the dog being held upside 
down above a beer keg and appearing to drink from its tap was posted 
during a college party last Saturday.

The man holding the dog in the picture was wearing a Brockport college t-shirt which sparked speculation that he was a student at the school.

The photo was posted on Twitter account 'Suny Party Stories' before it went viral.

The Suny Party Stories Twitter page posts pictures of parties held at the State University of New York.

Every Sunday, the page hosts a competition for the best party picture of the week.

Yesterday, a tweet from the page read: 'Any news reporter that thinks a dog posedÂ  doing a keg stand is a worthy story needs to reconsider their career.'

Local police have identified Oliver as the man pictured holding the black Labrador Retriever known as Mya.

Police have confirmed that Oliver, from Bergen New York, is a student at Brockport. School officials have confirmed that Yates, from West Seneca New York, is also a student.

A news release from Brockport force said: 'Through a joint investigation between the SUNY Brockport Police, the Brockport Police Department and the Sweden Dog Warden, it was learned that a dog was held upside down, and apparently forced to consume beer from a keg during a party that occurred on Saturday, March 8, 2014 at a house located on Monroe Avenue in the village of Brockport.'

The pair have been charged with a misdemeanor under Agriculture and Marketing Law for torturing an animal.

They will stand trial on April 2 at Sweden Town Court, Monroe County, N.Y.

A spokesman for the college told USA today that officials 'were alarmed to see the photos and will investigate it and take appropriate action.'

'But other than that it's pretty difficult to comment because the student privacy laws really tie our hands in terms of what we can say as it relates to specific student discipline,' said spokesman John Follaco.

Mya is now safe and in good health. She is being cared for by the local dog warden.
