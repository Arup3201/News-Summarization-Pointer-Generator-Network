A mother-of-two has dropped an incredible 18 stone in just one year - after being told she had just five years to live.

Charmaine Wilkinson, from Cambridge, tipped the scales at a staggering 34 stone and was told by doctors that her bones would crumble if her her weight continued to rise.

Most alarmingly, the 34-year-old was told she would not live to see 40.

It was the wake-up call she needed to turn her life around and, after having a gastric bypass, she slimmed to 16 stone in just 12 months.

She also dropped an incredible ten dress sizes, going from a 32 to a svelte 12.

Now Charmaine is looking forward to wedding her partner Mike Faulkner - after an 11-year engagement.

She said: 'My health was deteriorating. I got out of breath easily and I had difficulties walking. It felt like I was an old woman.

'I had also ballooned so much over the years that my engagement ring wouldn’t even fit on my finger anymore.'

Charmaine said the weight started to pile on after having her children Maison, 13, and four-year-old Poppy.

During the day she would be so busy running after her brood that she would have her evening meal late and her daily diet consisted of snacking on junk food and fizzy drinks.

But it wasn’t until doctors dropped the bombshell that she decided it was time to take drastic action.

She explained: 'The thought of not getting married or seeing my children grow up was devastating.'

Since her operation, 6ft Charmaine has slimmed to a size 12 by eating smaller, healthier portions and exercising.

She said: 'I kept a blog on Facebook of my weight loss and seeing the difference in a few months was incredible. I look so different and feel more glamorous.'

She added: 'My fiancé and I can now set a wedding date. I feel like a new woman and I can’t wait to try on dresses.'
