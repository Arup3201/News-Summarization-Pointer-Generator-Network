A restaurant boss was today found guilty of throwing a champagne glass at The Voice reject Sam Buttery after he belted out a Cole Porter show tune in the street.

The 22-year-old former talent show finalist ‘drew attention to himself’ when he gave a rendition of It’s De-Lovely as he strolled past Nima Safaei’s Italian eatery in Soho, central London, a court heard.

Mr Buttery - who was part of Tom Jones’s team in series one of the BBC TV competition - reacted angrily when 33-year-old Safaei told him to ‘go to the gym’, Southwark Crown Court was told.

The singer, who went on to star in West End Boy George musical, Taboo, retorted: ‘Don’t you know who I am?’ He then threw the contents of a glass of champagne in Safaei's face.

Safaei got hold of the glass and launched the glass back at Mr Buttery’s head, causing a 1.6in wound to his head and a cut to his ear, the court heard.

Mr Buttery was taken to hospital and received plastic surgery after the incident last June 4. It happened outside Forty Dean Street - a restaurant once owned by celebrity chef Aldo Zilli.

Safaei had insisted he did not throw the champagne flute and said that he simply pushed the glass he was holding back 'with force'.

But the Iranian born restaurateur, who lives in Bayswater, west London, was convicted of unlawful wounding by a majority of 11-to-one, after eight-and-a-half hours of deliberation.

Bailing Safaei ahead of sentence on February 21, Judge Martin Beddoe told him: ‘The real issue is whether there might be circumstances where I could suspend the sentence and direct you to do various things to make reparations. I’m undecided about that.’

Mr Buttery had briefly performed the Cole Porter trick in court as he described his version of events to jurors.

Wearing a dark red shirt and his trademark funky black glasses, the TV star was handed a tissue by court staff after becoming emotional while giving evidence.

Mr Buttery was with his flamboyant friend Daniel Lismore - who has been dubbed ‘London’s most outrageous dresser’- at the time.

Wearing a black hat and cape over a smart black suit, with his long brown hair tied in a low-ponytail, Mr Lismore claimed Safaei shouted at his friend: ‘Go to the gym.’

Safaei then said ‘something about being fat’ to his friend, he said.

Moments later a champagne glass ‘whistled’ past his head, Mr Lismore said. ‘Obviously I was shocked at what I had just seen, and my friend was gushing with blood.

‘I saw him (Safaei) throw it, I saw the glass leave his hand, but I turned at that point. I ducked, as I didn’t know if it was going to hit me or not.’

The actor, DJ and stylist insisted Mr Buttery’s behaviour was not the result of him being drunk.

‘Sam played Leigh Bowery in Taboo which is an amazing musical and he didn’t need a drink to do that. I know what he is like when he is drunk and he didn’t appear to be drunk.

‘I think Sam has had enough of people commenting on his image and he said he didn’t understand what makes someone say that.

‘We are both quite successful in our careers and we don’t have time to mess around.’

Mr Lismore said he tried to stop his friend from confronting Safaei. ‘I don’t like negativity of any kind, especially hatred, which I believe it was for no reason.’

But he added: ‘I think he (Mr Buttery) was welcome to ask ‘why have you just attacked me in the street?’, we want to know why someone is prosecuting us in society. ‘

Mr Buttery once claimed in a magazine interview that he punched Voice judge Will.i.am for nicknaming him ‘Butters’ - meaning ‘butt ugly’.

The singer was also mistaken for a girl in the blind auditions of the talent contest. Neither the TV star or Mr Lismore were present in court for the verdict. Safaei denied but was convicted of unlawful wounding.
