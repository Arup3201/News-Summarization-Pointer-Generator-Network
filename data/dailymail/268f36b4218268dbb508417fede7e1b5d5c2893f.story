These images show the moment a squid overpowers a huge fish after wrapping its tentacles around it.

The small, red squid came out on top by using its sharp beak after an hour-long battle with a much bigger owlfish which was captured on film in Moneterey Bay, California.

In the images, the squid grips the fish around the head as the two of them tussle and sink deeper into the sea.

It paralysed its prey by cutting through the fish's backbone as the fight continued for an hour

It paralysed its prey by cutting through the fish's backbone and the whole fight was captured by the Monterey Bay Aquarium Research Institute.

A mobile vehicle, called The Doc Ricketts, spotted the pair at about 1,475 feet below the surface.

Susan von Thun, an MBARI senior research technician, said they watched the struggle for about 50 minutes before returning to the surface.

Speaking to LiveScience, she said: 'They were sinking rapidly the whole time, and we think that's part of the squid's tactic. We see a lot of feeding events, and oftentimes the squid gets startled and lets go, but this guy held on for the whole time that we watched it.'

The squid and owlfish dropped to a depth of 1,970 feet during the altercation

Tight grip: this owlfish was being held too tightly to escape and is twisted in the squid's tentacles

Brutal: Tentacles also cover the fish's gills - perhaps in an attempt to suffocate it

The squid and owlfish dropped to a depth of 1,970 feet during the altercation.

An owlfish can escape a squid by shedding its scales to slip away from its tentacles or by flicking its tail.

But this owlfish was being held too tightly to escape and as the video progresses, the fish is twisted in the squid's tentacles and being bitten until it gives up.

Tentacles also cover the fish's gills - perhaps in an attempt to suffocate it.

The David and Goliath battle was between a 10 to 12 inch long owlfish and the smaller four to five inch squid.
