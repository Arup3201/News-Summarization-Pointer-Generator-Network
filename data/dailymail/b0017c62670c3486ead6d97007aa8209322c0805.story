A 24-year-old Arizona cop who had been on the force less than a year was killed Saturday during a shootout with a suspect in a domestic violence case.

Tyler Stewart was shot in the face after attending to a call in Flagstaff about about 1.30pm.

Police say the suspect, Robert W. Smith, 28, of Prescott, fired several shots at the officer and then shot himself dead, according to AZ Central.

Killed: Tyler Stewart, 24, was attending a domestic violence call on Saturday when he was shot dead

Scene: Police were called to the home where Stewart and a male suspect had been shot

Rookie: Stewart had only been on the force for less than a year before he was killed

Investigation: Police closed off the 800 block of West Clay Avenue after the shooting Saturday

Other officers were called to the scene after Stewart flipped his emergency button.

However they could not get him on the radio.

The officers found Stewart critically wounded.

He was taken to Flagstaff Medical Center but later died.

'This is an enormous tragedy for our department and the family of our Officer,' local police chief Kevin Treadway told AZ Central.

'We are a very close knit organization, and know that all members of the Flagstaff Police Department are grieving at this time. 

Gone too soon: The 24-year-old was a graduate of Boulder Creek High School in Anthem, Arizona, and Concordia College in California

'With that being said, all of the men and women of the Flagstaff Police Department extend our prayers and condolences to the family of our Officer Tyler Stewart.'

Flagstaff mayor Jerry Nabours shared the sentiments, saying that it's 'heartbreaking to lose one of our officers. We collectively mourn for his family and the entire department'.

Stewart was a graduate of Boulder Creek High School in Anthem, Arizona, and Concordia College in California. 

Because he had been officer less than 12 months, he was still considering a rookie.
