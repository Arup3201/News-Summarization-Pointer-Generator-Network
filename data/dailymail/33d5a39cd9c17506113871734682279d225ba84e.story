A pool cleaner and maintenance man to Sydney's eastern suburbs and north shore has become Australia's first convicted 'sexter' after he sent explicit photographs and videos to women clients suggesting what he'd like to do to them in their backyard swimming pools.

Peter Lewis Sheather pleaded guilty in Sydney's Downing Centre Court to nine charges of sending text messages on his iPhone 5 depicting nudity and lewd acts.

The 41-year-old sent the messages to eight Sydney womenwho were customers of two pool maintenance firms, Pool Doctor Services of Roseville on Sydney's upper north shore and Swim Art in Rose Bay, in the eastern suburbs.

Explicit messages: Pool cleaner Peter Sheather, 41, (pictured) pleaded guilty in the Downing Centre Court in Sydney to sending messages on his Apple iPhone5 to women who were clients of two pool firms in Sydney eastern suburbs and upper north shore suggesting what he'd like to do to them in their backyard swimming pools

Pool owner victims: Convicted 'sexter' Peter Sheather targeted women customers of Swim Art in Rose Bay and Pool Doctor Services in Roseville in March and April this year with suggestive text messages and explicit photos and videos of naked men involved in sex acts

Sheather worked for both companies as a pool cleaner and used the women clients' mobile numbers plus intimate details about them and their backyard pools in text messages on a secret iPhone account he had obtained under a false name.

Most of the calls originated in the upmarket Sydney suburbs of Bellevue Hill and Paddington.

He also pleaded guilty to sending images of a naked man engaged in a sex act to a woman he met on the dating site Plenty of Fish.

Police facts tendered at the court say Sheather's sexting campaign which caused 'fear and offence' against the eight women pool owners began on March 4 this year when he sent a text to a woman named Sheila at at 12.29pm saying, 'Hey u. Did you get my photo this morning'.

21st century crime: Peter Lewis Sheather (pictured leaving Downing Centre Court after pleading guilty to nine 'sexting' charges) will receive psychological counselling before his sentencing in August. He harassed women pool owners in Sydney's eastern suburbs and upper north shore with lurid messages and images

A second text to Sheila on March 14 at 7.12pm said in part, 'I'd love to f*** you in your pool ... Sheila'.

Police say the text frightened and offended the victim due to its 'overtly sexual nature' and the fact it shows the accused knows the victim's name and the fact the victim has a pool which cannot be seen from the street'.

Sheather's next victim was a woman named Brittany who on March 7 at 7.03am he texted a message with 'a picture of a male standing naked with a semi-erect penis'.

The head and face of the man could not be seen in the photo. The accompanying message read, 'Shower time. Wanna join me honey?'

Peter Sheather: Hey sexy Liz. How's u?

Liz: Fine. How r u and who r u

PS: it's simon. Didn't you save my number?

Liz: Simon who

PS: Have u seriously forgotten

Liz: I know a lot of people called Simon

PS: Well we haven't been intimate lol. That narrow it down?

Liz: Not really

PS: Would a pic help??

Liz: Yep as long as it ain't intimate

PS: Meaning not of my c***

Liz: Yeah you'd probably need a zoom lens anyway

PS: Like you big t***

Liz: F*** off

PS: Don't be like that Liz Let me [words removed here by Mailonline] and f*** u in your pool

At 1.05pm on the same day he texted the same photograph and message to his third victim.

About a week later, at 11.56am on March 14, he texted her again saying, 'Hey sexy Kristina. How's your week honey?'

On the evening of that day he sent a message to victim four, Nicole, saying in part, 'I'd love to f*** u in your pool ... Nicole'.

On the same morning a woman called Margaret became victim number five when he texted her at 10.32am saying in part, 'I'd love to f*** u in your pool ... Maggie'.

On the morning of March 19, a woman called Elizabeth became unwittingly involved in a text 'conversation' with Sheather after he sent her a message saying, 'Hey sexy Liz. How's u?'.

Not knowing who sent the message, she replied, 'Fine. How r u and who r u?'

The texts went back and forth for almost three hours until Sheather suggested he sent a photograph, mentioned his 'c***' and mentioned her 'big t***' and suggested she let him 'f*** u in your pool'.

That evening Sheather texted his seventh victim, a woman named Nicole, saying, 'Hey sexy Gal. How's your week been? Did you work today or lazed at home.'

Shower time: Peter Lewis Sheather's lewd text messages to eight women customers of two Sydney pool maintenance businesses including Pool Doctor (above). The messages included one he sent to two different women saying, 'Shower time. Wanna join me honey?'

Nicole did not answer because she believed the message was spam, however just over seven hours later, at 1.47am on March 20, Sheather sent her a 15 second long video which police say 'depicted an erect penis being masturbated and ejaculating' with a message saying, 'Nicky McSticky?'.

Sheather's last victim was a woman called Catherine, who he texted at 5.30pm on April 10 saying, 'I'd love to take to [sic] downstairs and f*** your brains out in your pool while you look over the harbour'.

Meanwhile, police say Sheather had similarly sent sexually explicit messages to a woman he had met on the dating website Plenty of Fish in November 2012, introducing himself as 'Rick Smithe'.

The friendship ceased a month later after, police say, Sheather sent the woman, Deborah, 'a multimedia text message ... containing a photo of a penis ejaculating'.

He contacted her again in January, 2013, to try and arrange a meeting but Deborah refused saying she 'did not feel comfortable'.

At 7pm on March 11 this year, Deborah received a text from 'Rick's' mobile saying, 'Hello stranger' to which she did not reply.

Sheather then sent her a text 'Want you so bad Deb' accompanied by a video she did not look at.

She sent back a text saying, 'Taking my phone straight to the police station', to which he responded, 'You do that'.

Deborah texted back, 'What is your problem? Don't you ever contact me again you disgusting pig'.

After she contacted police at Maitland Local Area Command in the Hunter Valley north of Sydney, officers viewed the footage which they said 'consisted of a hand masturbating an erect penis and the penis ejaculating'.

They telephoned Sheather and asked him for his date of birth and other personal details, which he refused, saying when officers told him they would identify him by other means, 'Well f***ing do it' before hanging up.

At 7.30pm on April 23, police stopped Sheather in Vaucluse, in Sydney's eastern suburbs and asked if he owned an Apple iPhone 5, which he denied ever having.

At 10.45am the following day officers executed a search warrant on his apartment in Cammeray, on Sydney's North Shore, where they found an Apple IPhone 5 charger in the bedroom plus a docket for its purchase, and seized a laptop.

Sheather again denied owning an iPhone5, but after being taken to North Sydney Police Station he 'made a full and frank admission to all offences'.

He told police the photos and videos were not of himself but that he had found them on the internet.

He told police he had destroyed the iPhone just days earlier by smashing the iPhone 5 with a hammer and throwing it into a bin on New South Head Road in the exclusive Sydney suburb of Double Bay.

He said he had thrown the SIM card from his car while driving through nearby Bellevue Hill.

Mr Sheather pleaded guilty before Deputy Chief Magistrate Jane Culver to nine counts of using a carriage service to menace, harass or offend.

Ms Culver agreed to continue his bail while he underwent psychological counselling and assessment for eight weeks. He will be sentenced on August 14.

Mr Sheather told Mailonline outside the court he had 'no comment' about his offences.
