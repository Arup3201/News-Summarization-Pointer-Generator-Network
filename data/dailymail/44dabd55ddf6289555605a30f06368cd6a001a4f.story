Silicon Valley proved on Tuesday that the tech world wants you to vote -- but who do they want you to vote for?

Tech giant Google, based in the Democratic stronghold of California, teamed up with youth turnout-focused Rock the Vote along with other groups to create a tool on their homepage that directs uninformed voters to their polling place.

'The voting process can often feel complicated, with the information about how to head to the polls spread across multiple official sources,' wrote Google executive and former Obama campaigner Anthea Watson Strong. 

Are you voting? Facebook and Google want to know. And apps like this, which sprung up for Facebook users across America today, want to spread the word...but who are they targeting?

Polling places: Google built a widget into certain search results today that allows uninformed users to easily find their poling place

In order to remedy this, Google homepage users who click on an animated ballot box are whisked over to a list of how-to-vote results.

At the top of the page is a box where users must simply enter their address to be shown their polling place.

As WebProNews notes, 'register to vote' or 'how do I vote' searches will lead users to a list of area-specific results.

Facebook, another San Francisco Bay area company, has gotten in on the action, too.

Users of the social media site have the option of clicking an 'I'm a voter' button at the top of their page to brag to friends, family and co-workers that they cast their ballot this year. 

Left wing magazine The New Republic boasted after Election Day 2010 about a study that showed the tactic 'ultimately caused an additional 340,000 votes to be cast that day' after the Facebook app mobilized 60,000 voters.

Uber suspicious? In Colorado, where incumbent Democrat Mark udall is having a tough time of it this election year, Uber  in Denver has offered a cut rate for voters who want to use the car service to get to the polls

The rest of the votes, the study concluded, were caused by a ripple effect within Facebook communities.

Another hard left wing publication, Mother Jones, wrote--as if it were someplace to celebrate--of how Facebook tweaked its analytics prior to Election 2012 in order to goad users into hitting the voting booths.

Via NPR:

'Facebook increased the amount of hard news stories at the top of the feeds of 1.9 million users. According to one Facebook data scientist, that change—which users were not alerted to—measurably increased civic engagement and voter turnout.'

Up-and-coming tech giant Uber is also helping people get to the polls, reports the Hill.

In Denver--where Democratic incumbent Senator Mark Udall is desperately trying to fend off a Republican challenger--the company has offered carless voters a cut rate if they use the app to get to their polling place.

It's clear that Silicon Valley wants Americans to vote, but less clear is why.

Google's campaign spending has increased forty-fold in the last eight years, writes the National Journal, and while the beneficiaries are split evenly between Democrats and Republicans, the minds and executives behind the company may not be.

CEO Eric Schmidt has personally donated $527,214  to political causes in 2014, $250,000 of which went to the Democratic Senate Majority PAC.

Previous recipients of the billionaire's campaign contributions include Democratic Rep. Zoe Lofgren Democratic New Jersey Sen. Cory Booker, and liberal U.S. Senate stalwart Barbara Boxer.
