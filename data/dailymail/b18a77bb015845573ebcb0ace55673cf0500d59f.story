It certainly beats earplugs - although it's a costly alternative.

Heathrow Airport will shell out £1.8 million to build sound-proof igloos in nearby schools to protects pupils' and teachers' ears from aircraft noise, after a successful trial at a school that lies within the flight path.

The airport plans to give 21 local schools £85,000 each so that they can build the adobe domes to muffle the noise, so that children can play outside and enjoy lessons outdoors.

Students from Hounslow Heath infants school play around one of four adobe huts designed to help minimise the noise of aircraft landing at Heathrow airport

The playground is directly under the flight path of Heathrow's southern runway and outside play for the children is interrupted every two minutes or so by landing aircraft passing over their heads

The domes are an invention of Iranian architect Nader Khalili and were originally meant for lunar settlements.

They were first employed in a refugee crisis after the 1990-91 Gulf war, but they work just fine forchildren in west London too.

The domes, which have also been installed in the Himalayan foothills of Nepal, are made out of bags of coiled earth tubes in an igloo-shape.

The technology avoids using expensive construction materials and the cost of transporting them.

Soil dug from the construction site is compressed into tubular bags which are laid one on top of the other to form walls.

Barbed wire is placed between the layers to hold the bags together. The bags are laid in a circle with a decreasing diameter of the rows towards the top.

Since 2005, the airport has been handing out some funds to schools to sound-proof their buildings - but local councils have argued that it is not enough to provide both noise insulation and ventilation, the Daily Telegraph reported.

The airport, which is the fourth busiest in the world, sees on average 1,288 flights arrive and depart from its five terminals - the equivalent of 471,000 flights a year.

Primary schools that are affected by 63 decibels and above are eligible for the adobe building funding as Heathrow says they recognise the importance of outdoor learning.

Another educational establishments will be given financial help to sound proof their buildings, a Heeathrow spokesman said.

The number of schools and colleges affected is 43, Heathrow said.

Seven nurseries, four libraries, four community/village halls and six hospices/nursing homes also fall within the zone.

The decision comes after one primary school close to Heathrow airport erected 'Teletubby' shaped domes to shut out the din.

Hounslow Heath infants' school built 
four igloo-like adobe domes in its grounds, a type normally used in 
earthquakes and emergency zones, to muffle the noise.

The playground is directly under the flight path of Heathrow's southern runway and outside play for the children is interrupted every two minutes or so by landing aircraft passing over their heads.

The domes, an invention of Iranian architect Nader Khalili, were originally meant for lunar settlements

The domes have no doors so are an open space but have a 'strong psychological and physical barrier' against the noise

'When children were playing outside, 
they had nowhere to go - they were subjected to that noise,' said the 
school's principal Kathryn Harper-Quinn.

The
domes are an invention of Iranian architect Nader Khalili and were 
originally meant for lunar settlements - but they are so effective in 
shutting out noise they have been used in the playground.

'For play time it's fantastic that 
they have somewhere to withdraw - even the ones that are too young to 
articulate that they're feeling concerned about the noise,' Ms 
Harper-Quinn said.

The domes have no doors so are an open space but with a 'strong psychological and physical barrier' against the noise, she said.

She estimates that when outside, teachers are inaudible to pupils for 25 seconds in every 90 because of the jets.

'You can still hear the planes in the huts but you can also hear your own voice,' she said.

The school teaches 520 infants aged between three and seven and its experiment with the domes has prompted others in the area to consider following suit.

The domes were first employed in a refugee crisis after the 1990-91 Gulf war - but have become a saviour at playtime

Planes pass just 180 metres (600 ft) over the area and their engines emit a noise level of 87 decibels.

Sound
tests inside the domes showed a noise reduction of over 17 decibels and
a considerable reduction in the duration of the noise, according to the
website of Small Earth which makes the structures.

Aircraft noise is a thorny political issue for the government, as it tries to establish where and how to expand airport capacity.

Business leaders and airlines are pressing him to expand Heathrow, a move which would affect the 750,000 people living under the flight path.

Heathrow has been making efforts to tackle the noise the inevitably arises from its airport

Options for increasing capacity at London Heathrow airport include a third runway and allowing planes to land and take-off on its two runways at the same time instead of the current alternating pattern.

'Having quiet time is absolutely critical. To lose runway alternation would be a disaster,' said Harper-Quinn.

Heathrow has been making efforts to tackle the noise the inevitably arises from its airport.

It has launched a programme critiquing airlines according to their noise performance.

Every three months a 'Fly Quiet' table will take the top 50 Heathrow airlines (by number of flights per quarter) and list them according to six noise related criteria.

The airlines receive a red/amber/green rating for each criterion, as well as an overall score which allows airlines to understand how they are performing in relation to other airlines.

'If they are not meeting the minimum performance targets, Heathrow will work closely with them to improve their rating.
