It took paramedics 19 minutes to reach the Florida State University professor who was fatally shot outside his home after a misunderstanding on the 911 call, it has emerged.

Dan Markel, 41, was shot as he drove his car to his garage in Tallahassee on Friday July 18. The gunman - who has still not been identified - shot once through the car window, striking him in the jaw.

A neighbor noticed the car on the driveway and, concerned about a recent spate of break-ins in the area, decided to check it out. After discovering the professor in a pool of blood, he called 911.

'He's inside [the car],' he said. 'I don't know if somebody tried to shoot him or if he shot himself or what. I don't know... You need to send an ambulance in a hurry. He's still alive. He’s moving.'

Victim: Florida State University law professor Dan Markel was shot dead in his Tallahassee, Florida garage on July 18 but it took an ambulance 19 minutes to reach him after confusion on the call

But the dispatcher failed to hear the caller mention the gunshot wound, delaying the response, ABC News reported.

'The officer is going to be there first.
 [The EMT] is not going to come until we figure out what’s going on, but
 they are on the way as well, OK?' the dispatcher said.

The neighbor responded: 'They better be if this guy's got a shot at living.'

On the 911 call, confusion can also be heard as one EMS unit was replaced by another and as the dispatcher urged police to go.

ABC reported that the average wait time for ambulances in the area is just nine minutes.

Markel passed away at the hospital 14 hours later.

Timothy Lee, the head of the dispatch center, agreed there had been confusion.

'On the onset of the call, it was entered into the computer system as a man down versus a gunshot wound,' he said, adding that they were holding a review and making changes.

Authorities have increased the reward in the case to $10,000. There are no suspects so far, even though police believe Markel was targeted.

One of the only clues they have is that a person was seen a Toyota Prius nearby after the shooting.

Markel's murder has so far baffled 
police and surprised family and friends who claim the loving 
father-of-two had no enemies to speak of and had just begun a new 
relationship after a painful divorce. His shocked ex-wife has been questioned but has not been linked to the killing.

However, the targeted nature of his killing has led to some speculation about whether he was the target of a contract killing.

The scholar, who was buried in his hometown of Toronto on Thursday, had his critics.

Thirty-six
 hours before he met his killer, 41-year-old Markel's thoughts were 
firmly fixed on his most passionate cause, the death penalty, posting an
 essay on the subject to his legal blog.
