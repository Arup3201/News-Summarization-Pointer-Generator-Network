It was once the hub of a filthy, bustling and intense trade in human cattle, which saw millions of men, women and children pass through its docks.

The Valongo wharf in Rio de Janeiro was a slave market and centre for the industry in the early 1800s, when Brazil was a far greater buyer of slaves than anywhere in North America.

But the dark hub of the slave trade in Rio, which was unearthed by archaeologists in the scramble to redevelop the city ahead of the 2016 Olympic Games, has once again become the centre of controversy.

For while architects and developers in the city hurry through their construction projects, scholars of Brazilian history - and the descendants of the country's slave population - have begun a fight to properly acknowledge and memorialise the historic discovery, rather than covering it with buildings.

The port area, once the home to 'fattening houses' where exhausted and diseased slaves would be groomed and sent on to plantations, is being rapidly reshaped into a development which will be known as the Porto Maravilha - which translate as 'marvellous port'. It will be many visitors' first sight of Rio as they approach the city in 2016.

But the area is currently occupied, and also prominent Brazilian historians have complained that efforts to commemorate the area's past are far too little. A local campaign is applying pressure to have the area recognised as a world heritage site by Unesco.

Construction: The area is being cleared out so that skyscrapers and gated villas can be built

Works: Locals and campaigners have said that the work is happening too quickly and more needs to be done to recognise the area's history

Finds: Archaeologists discovered the area in 2011 and uncovered hundreds of items related to the slave trade

Critics have said the efforts which are being made, such as the $100million Museum of Tomorrow, dedicated to science and technology, are a step in the opposite direction, along with the skyscrapers and gated villas earmarked for construction.

Sonia Rabello, a legal academic who once sat on the city's council, complained that the potential for properly recognising the space was being ignored in favour of speedy development.

Speaking to the New York Times, she said: 'We’re finding archaeological sites of 
global importance, and probably far more extensive than what’s been 
excavated so far, but instead of prioritizing these discoveries our 
leaders are proceeding with their grotesque remaking of Rio.'

Cláudio Lima Carlos, an architect, told the newspaper: 'Archaeologists are exposing the 
foundations of our unequal society while we are witnessing a perverse 
attempt to remake the city into something resembling Miami or Dubai.

Found: This bronze token is a religious object which would have belonged to slaves or their descendants

'We’re losing an opportunity to focus in detail on our past, and maybe even learn from it.'

The Valongo wharf was in operation from 1818 to 1830, when it was later replaced with a more ornate version in honour of a Portuguese empress. The slave trade continued for decades after in Brazil, and was only abolished in 1888, more than 80 years after it was abolished in the British Empire.

Even while the trade was in full flow, visitors from England were horrified, with clergyman Robert Walsh writing at the time: 'They are handled by the purchaser in different parts, exactly as I have seen butchers feeling a calf,' he said. 'I sometimes saw groups of well-dressed females here, shopping for slaves, exactly as I have seen English ladies amusing themselves at our bazaars.'

Digs: The area is being prepared for a transformation into the 'Porto Marvaliha'
