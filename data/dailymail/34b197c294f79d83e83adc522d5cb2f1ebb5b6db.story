At the age of 100, most pensioners could be forgiven for spending their centenary year with a well-earned cup of tea and slice of cake.

But Tom Marsden refuses to take life easy and enjoys nothing more than pumping iron in the gym three times a week.

Spritely Mr Marsden has had two knee replacements, but the fitness fanatic father-of-one is showing no signs of letting up, despite an adventurous lifetime of scuba diving, stunt driving and motor racing - as well as working as a chicken farmer and aero-engineer.

At the grand age of 100 Tom Marsden should be taking life easy - but instead he's pumping iron in the gym three times a week

He was 72 when he took up scuba diving and 
did his last dive at the ripe age of 90 after the hobby took him around 
the world.

The pensioner is the oldest member of Everybodyz gym at Rhyl Sun Centre - where he regularly lifts weights, works out on the rowing machine and treadmills.

The gym held him a special birthday party to mark his recent milestone, where Mr Marsden admitted he has no intention of sitting at home in his slippers.

He said: 'I will carry on for as long as I possibly can.

'Working out is a great pastime and I've made lots of friends at the gym.'

Everybodyz fitness instructor Jake Rousseau said living the active lifestyle appears to be the secret of longevity in Rhyl, with other gym members in their eighties and nineties.

He said: 'Tom is a real inspiration. He has been a member of our gym since 1996 and comes here three times a week.

'Tom usually spends 20 minutes on the rowing machine, 20 minutes on the treadmill and also lifts weights - even though he's had two knee replacements.

'He doesn't look anywhere near 100 - he has so much energy.'

He added: 'Our second oldest member is a man called Bill, who's 93. He also comes along three times a week and sings along to his iPod while he's on the treadmill.

'We also have members aged 83 and 84 and a lady who is 79 - it's fantastic.'

Mr Marsden's friend, Stuart Gregory, said they met at a scuba diving club over 30 years ago.

He said: 'I've done dives with Tom all over the world down to wrecks that are younger than him. He's got an amazing appetite for life.

'Tom has been a racing driver, got into motorbikes, took part in the TT races and was even spent time as a stunt driver.

'In his youth he was an aero-engineer before moving to North Wales when he was in his fifties.

'He ran a large chicken farm when he got here, which produced thousands of eggs per week.

'He's also a member of Rhyl Yacht Club and up until he sold his boat recently, would often go sailing off on his own.

'He lives alone and is a very independent man after becoming widowed. He is truly an inspiration to others.'
