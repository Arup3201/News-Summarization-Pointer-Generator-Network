A bungling robber who held up a shop at knife point was caught when his mask slipped and revealed his face to CCTV cameras.

John Cleaver, 31, was fleeing the Spar shop in Rowley Regis, West Midlands, on November 16 last year with £1,000 in cash when a scarf he used to disguise himself slipped.

The image was captured on the shop's security cameras and detectives recognised Cleaver as the robber.

Cleaver, described as a 'career criminal', had recently been released from prison after serving 11 years for car-jacking

The moment the mask slipped: Robber John Cleaver held up a shop at knife point in West Midlands but his face was caught on CCTV footage when his mask slipped

When officers swooped on his home in Pensnett, Dudley, West Midlands, they discovered four photos of the stolen cash on Cleaver's mobile phone and clothes which matched those of the raider.

Cleaver, described as a 'career criminal', had recently been released from prison after serving 11 years for car-jacking.

On Wednesday he was jailed for seven years at Wolverhampton Crown Court.

Speaking after the case, Detective Constable Ryan Matthews, of West Midlands Police, said: 'Cleaver's face covering slipped for just a split second during the robbery but that was all we needed to identify him and put arrest plans in place.

'He's the kind of person people class as a "career criminal" - but it's a career leading to him spending most of his life behind bars.'

Cleaver sped away from the Spar in a stolen Mazda 6 which he had taken from the driveway of a house in Kingswinford, three hours before the robbery.

A search of his home uncovered clothing worn during the robbery and further CCTV enquiries showed Cleaver buying a crowbar used in the robbery from a hardware store the previous day.

Det Con Matthews added: 'None of the store staff were injured but a seven year prison sentence reflects the gravity of the offence and that the shop assistants were understandably fearful for their safety.'
