Elisabeth Hasselbeck has revealed she will return to co-hosting Fox & Friends tomorrow morning after a mystery operation forced her to take a month-long break.

The 37-year-old's unplanned leave was announced by her colleagues on the show on Wednesday October 16 when she did not show up for duty the day after surgery.

The station has refused to disclose details of Hasselbeck's condition, and today she tweeted that she has recovered.

She told her 389,000 followers: 'Full of #gratitude to be back TOMORROW 6am EST on @foxandfriends! Morning are #BetterWithFriends like all of you!'

Fox News' Kimberly Guilfoyle was drafted in to replace Hasselbeck last month when her co-host Steve Doocy told viewers: 'In case you were wondering where Elisabeth is today and this week, well, she had some surgery yesterday and she's going to be out for a couple of weeks.' 

Fox called Hasselbeck's surgical procedure 'a private matter.'  

Another of Hasselbeck's Fox co-hosts, Brian Kilmeade, was confident she would recover quickly from the unknown ailment.

'She is strong, she is tough, and a better athlete than me,' Kilmeade said. 

'We heard from her last night and she said she is feeling good. So, in a short time, she'll be back on the set.'

Fox News representatives told The Wrap: 'Elisabeth has asked for all to respect her wishes for privacy in regards to further details at this time.'
