Rapper 50 Cent has defended himself after his wildly off-target first pitch at the New York Mets stadium on Tuesday night.

The Queens-raised rapper threw the ceremonial pitch before the Mets took on the Pittsburgh Pirates at Citi Field. Standing 
on the home plate, 50 Cent 
launched a left-handed toss that sailed wide of Mets catcher Anthony
 Recker, much to the amusement of the home crowd, many of whom winced and turned away.

He appeared to be a little peeved about his throw, last night tweeting: 'Iâ€™m a hustler not a Damn ball player.'

The ball bounced to the backstop and nearly nicked a cameraman standing not all that far from the Mets' on-deck circle as 50 Cent and New York pitcher Jonathon Niese both smiled.

The rapper did see the funny side, later adding an Instagram video with the message: 'The s*** almost hit the camera man damn, if you look close you can see them moving the plate. Lol'

The Internet lit up after the star, whose real name is Curtis Jackson III, made his throw with some critics dubbing it the worst first pitch ever.

Sportscasters called the pitch 'not great' and one added: 'It's good he never had a choice between playing for the Mets or being a rapper.'

Wearing a Mets jersey with No. 50 and the name Jackson on the back, 50 Cent, posed with a bat alongside Curtis Granderson and other Mets on the field during batting practice.

50 Cent was born in nearby South Jamaica and has a postgame concert at Citi Field scheduled for June 14.

Though 50 Cent is unlikely to join the Mets anytime soon, the rapper appears busy with his own projects.

His album Animal Ambition will be released next week, and Starz drama Power, of which he is an executive producer, will premiere on June 7.
