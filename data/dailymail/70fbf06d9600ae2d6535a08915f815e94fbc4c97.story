A pensioner confined to a wheelchair was crushed to death after a runaway car with no handbrake on rolled down the hill in a hospital car park and trapped him underneath.

Double amputee Frederick Morton, 79, was hit by the unmanned car on Monday as he moved across St Marks Hospital car park in Maidenhead, Berkshire, in his electric wheelchair.

The 1.5-tonne silver Vauxhall Zafir had crept forward after it appears its female driver got out of the vehicle without the handbrake being properly positioned.

Morton, 79, was crushed to death by an unmanned car in the car park of St Marks Hospital in Maidenhead, Berkshire, pictured above, which rolled down the 
hill after it appears its handbrake was not properly set

She came out of the hospital to find firefighters lifting her car off Mr Morton, who had been knocked from his chair and was trapped underneath the vehicle.

Paramedics and doctors tried to revive the pensioner but he was pronounced dead at the scene.

It was understood Mr Morton, from Bracknell, Berkshire, had just left a medical appointment at the hospital and was returning to his car when the accident unfolded.

The driver, who has not been named by police, recorded a negative drink-drive breath test and passed a roadside fitness test.

She was questioned by police but was not arrested.

The vehicle was lifted off Mr Morton by crews from the Royal Berkshire Fire and Rescue Service and was later impounded by police for forensic testing.

Mr Morton, who was said by neighbours to live an independent life despite his disability, lived in a 1960s-built ground floor maisonette.

A neighbour in Ploughlands said: 'It’s absolutely tragic. I just can’t believe it was him who died.

'I would often see him around - he had his own specially adapted car and he seemed to be quite determined and independent.'

Thames Valley Police has now appealed for any witnesses to the fatal collision to get in touch.

A police spokesman said a file was being prepared for the Berkshire coroner, Peter Bedford, who was awaiting formal identification to take place.

A post-mortem examination was due to be conducted at Wexham Park Hospital, Slough.

A spokesman for St. Mark’s Hospital 
declined to comment on the accident, saying the hospital could not add 
anything during a police investigation.

'The victim, a 79-year-old man from Bracknell, was trapped by the car a d died at the scene.'

Police Constable Melanie Todd, who is leading the investigation for the Serious Collision Investigation Unit, said: 'I would like to speak to any witnesses who saw the collision or anyone with any information which could assist in the investigation.'
