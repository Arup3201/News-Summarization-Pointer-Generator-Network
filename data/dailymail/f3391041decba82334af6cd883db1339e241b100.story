It's been an emotional week for former glamour model Katie Price, 35, after she found out her part-time stripper husband Kieran Hayler, 26, was having an affair with her best friend Jane Pountney, 49.

Katie - who also recently discovered she was six months pregnant with her fifth child, her second with Kieran -  reportedly uncovered her third husband's affair earlier this week.

The expectant mother claims she was already suspicious about her husband's friendship with long-term friend Jane after she caught the pair in a moonlit tryst on holiday - but at the time accepted the pair's emphatic claims it was a drunken kiss.

Moonlit tryst: Katie Price discovered Kieran Hayler (second right) kissing her best friend, Jane Pountney (L), on holiday in April, it's been reported

Upset: The model reportedly caught the pair in a moonlit tryst on holiday in April - but at the time accepted the pair's emphatic claims it was a drunken kiss

According the The Sun on Sunday newspaper, Katie had been on the lookout for evidence that Kieran was having an affair but never suspected it would be with her best friend.

However, the pregnant star had caught the pair in a passionate embrace during their recent holiday to Cape Verde in West Africa.

Katie immediately called Jane’s husband demanding he fly out to the island and talk through the tryst with the trio - which is when the pair claimed it had just been a 'drunken snog'.

Lies: The former glamour model reportedly already had suspicions about the pair after she reportedly caught them having a drunken kiss in Cape Verde

While Kieran and Jane thought they had managed to convince their other halves that it was just a drunken kiss, Katie was allegedly on high alert about Kieran’s movements and behaviour.

A source told The Sun: ‘When she got back from holiday she went through the internal CCTV camera footage from inside their home but found nothing incriminating’.

The source also claimed that Katie had been trying to get pregnant with the couple’s second child in the hope it would make Kieran less likely to cheat on her.

They added Katie felt that Kieran and Jane had made the ‘ultimate betrayal’ because their affair began while she was in hospital following the traumatic birth of her son, Jett, seven months ago.

Close group: Katie had reportedly been on the lookout for evidence that Kieran was having an affair but never suspected that it would be with her best friend

Jane publicly admitted to the affair in a joint statement with her husband on Friday.

The 49-year-old spoke of her 'deep regret' as the statement said: 'It is true that Jane and Kieran Hayler had an affair.

'This is something that Jane deeply regrets and we will not provide any more details about it.

'It is true that Kate found out about this affair yesterday.'

It was also reported on Friday that Miss Price feared her husband was having 'a second affair' - this time with the cousin of Prince Harry's ex girlfriend Cressida Bonas, April Bonas, 24.

Caught: While Kieran and Jane thought they had managed to convince their other halves that it was just a drunken kiss, Katie was allegedly on high alert about Kieran's movements and behaviour

Pregnant Katie announced the end of her third marriage on Twitter earlier this week, as she angrily accused her husband of having an affair with her best friend.

The former glamour model, better known as Jordan, told her followers that part-time stripper Kieran had been having a ‘full blown sexual affair’ with Jane.

Price said she had ‘caught them’ and branded Mrs Pountney a ‘wh*re’, ‘sl*t’ and ‘home-wrecker’, while describing Hayler as a ‘disgusting human being’.

But the husband of Mr Pountney initially denied his wife had a seven month affair with the star's spouse after leaving a 'tearful' crisis meeting on Wednesday afternoon with the feuding friends and Mr Hayler.

Happier times: The couple seemed to be the picture of domestic bliss during their holiday in Cape Verde last month

Mrs Pountney has been one of Miss Price’s closest friends for almost two decades and was a bridesmaid when the Katie married Mr. Hayler little more than a year ago.

She was pictured with the couple and her own husband Derrick, 52, after the lavish ceremony in the Bahamas.

But it seems that friendship is over after Katie tweeted: ‘Sorry to say me and Kieran are divorcing. Him and my best friend Jane Pountney been having a full blown sexual affair for seven months.’

Following her Twitter onslaught, Miss Price later released a more eloquent statement on her website, which read:

'I appreciate most people will have seen my tweets on the subject of my marriage to Kieran.

'I make no apologies for them though it 
will be appreciated that, sending them immediately after Kieran 
confirmed to me what he had been doing for the last 7 months, those 
tweets were a sign of my heart breaking. That he was doing it with a 
close friend of nearly 20 years is hard to understand.

Anger: Katie vented her emotions on Twitter

Friendship over: The  pregnant star didn't hold back her feelings

Worst timing: The former glamour model was clearly distraught

'This statement however is from my head, not my heart. I am appalled that someone I loved, trusted and believed in has behaved in this way.

'If he had so little respect for our relationship I would have hoped he would have thought about our child or the one that we have on the way. That he did not means he will no longer be part of my life. I will do all I can to ensure he maintains a relationship with his children should he want that.

'I am so grateful for the love of my children and family at this time.'

Miss Price, who is six months pregnant, 
has an eight-month-old son, Jett, with Hayler. The couple got engaged 
within weeks of meeting and married in January last year.In
 an interview shortly after they wed, Miss Price declared that the 
former builder would receive ‘f*** all’ of her estimated £45million 
fortune if they split because ‘it’s what will keep us together’.

Miss Price, who has four children by three fathers, arrived with Hayler for a showdown at the Pountneys’ five-bedroom detached home in an affluent West Sussex village hours after her tweet. They were quickly let in shortly before the curtains were drawn at 3pm. Hayler left the house after just 30 minutes with no comment. When Miss Price emerged three hours later, she hid her eyes behind sunglasses and was escorted to her car by Mr Pountney.Mrs Pountney, who has a ten-year-old son and is a director of her husband’s tyre recycling business, was also a bridesmaid for Miss Price when she married Alex Reid in Las Vegas in 2010.

MailOnline has contacted a representative for Katie Price for comment.
