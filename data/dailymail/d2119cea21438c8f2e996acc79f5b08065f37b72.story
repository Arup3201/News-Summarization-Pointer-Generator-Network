Birmingham Central Library and South Bank Centre in London also named as cultural heritage sites

For years it has hardly merited a second glance and is at risk of demolition - but Preston bus station has been named a 'historic' work of architectural beauty and added to a list of worldwide places that need protection.

The bus station in Lancashire, along with a Greek cemetery, the ancient Nazca Lines in Peru and a modernist building in New York are this year's most at-risk cultural heritage sites, according to the World Monuments Fund.

Some 67 structures in 41 countries have been placed on a 'Watch' list by the non-profit organisation which supports the preservation of 'treasured places'.

'Historic': Preston bus station in Lancashire has been added to a list of protected world monuments because of its 'concrete brutalist' style

The sites on the 2012 list balance heritage concerns with the social, economic, and environmental interests of communities around the world, said World Monuments Fund President Bonnie Burnham.

Miss Burnham said: 'While these sites are historic, they are also very much of the present - integral parts of the lives of the people who come into contact with them every day.

'Indeed, the Watch reminds us of our collective role as stewards of the earth and of its human heritage.'

The WMF is an independent organisation which aims to secure the future of 'exceptional' places through fundraising, conservation and education.

Among the newly-listed sites is the First Cemetery of Athens, the oldest in the Greek capital, which houses the graves of important figures from the past two centuries. The fund said it is in need of preservation as it has fallen into neglect.

The ancient Nazca lines and geoglyphs in the desert of southern Peru are also in jeopardy due to poorly managed tourism, says the fund.

The giant figures, which were drawn on the stone between 500 BC and 500 AD, were declared a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1994.

Built at the end of the 1960s, Preston bus station can hold 80 double-deckers and was once the largest terminal in the world.

It was designed by Keith Ingham and Charles Wilson of Building Design Partnership along with E.H Stazicker and is described as having a 'brutalist' style.

The building's engineers, Ove Arup and Partners, designed the distinctive curve of the car park balconies after vertical walls proved too expensive.

The edges have a functional aspect too - they protect car bumpers from crashing.

The structure has been threatened with demolition for around a decade as part of the council's redevelopment scheme.

A survey conducted by the Lancashire Evening Post last year found that Preston bus station was the local people's favourite building.

Preston Bus Station was once the world's largest but has been slated for demolition as part of a redevelopment scheme by the council.

It is listed by the fund along with other British sites described as 'concrete brutalism' including Birmingham Central Library and the Hayward Gallery at the South Bank Centre in London.

The library in Birmingham is to be knocked down in 2013 while the gallery in the South Bank complex has been refused listed building status.

Miss Burnham added: 'These and other buildings like them date from an era in which government had the resources and the will to create major civic buildings.

'They are too often seen as impediments to private-sector redevelopment.'

The World Monuments Fund also questioned the planning permission for recent 
alterations to the former Manufacturers Trust Company Building at 510 
Fifth Avenue, a small box-shaped glass building which sits among the Manhattan skyscrapers.

A spokesman for the fund said: 'Local advocates filed a lawsuit, and a temporary restraining order on further alterations has been issued.

'While the case seeks to preserve an icon of American modernism, it also serves as an important touchstone for the effectiveness of preservation legislation and policies in the United States, and of the government agencies charged with their enforcement.'

Several sites that have been damaged by earthquakes also made the list including locations in Japan, New Zealand and Haiti.

Since the fund started in 1996, some 688 sites across 132 countries have been protected.

There are seven British sites listed by the WMF this year. The others are: the medieval ruins of Coventry Cathedral; Newstead Abbey in Nottinghamshire, known as the home of Lord Byron; Quarr Abbey, a working monastery on the Isle of Wight, and St Helena, the island in the South Atlantic where Napoleon was held captive.

A
 spokesman added: 'The international attention given to 
watch sites provides a vital tool with which local entities may leverage
 funding from a variety of sources.'
