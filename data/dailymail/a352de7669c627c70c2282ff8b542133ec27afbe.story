Despite the Brazilians' reputation for partying, Britain has more fun than its carnival-loving rival.

The British - usually portrayed as reserved - also have more fun than the Dutch and French, according to a new study.

But while they may enjoy more fun than some of their European neighboughers, Germans are having more fun than us, while the Argentines are having more fun than anyone. 

Brazilians may have their famous carnival, but Britain's Notting Hill Carnival can rival it for fun

But the average Polish person has the least fun out of the 17 countries ranked, according to the poll.

The average young Briton, has fun 11.3 days a month – slightly more than young Brazilians, on 10.9 days, but far less than young Argentines, who have fun nearly 15 days a month, according to social network Badoo.

Louise Thompson, a spokesman for Badoo said: 'If there were a World Cup for Fun, the famously fun-loving Brazilians would surely start favourites.

'Yet, we British, not famed as funsters, turn out to be having more fun than they are.'

'The Brazilians have Samba dancing, while we have Morris Dancing. They have Copacabana beach, while we have Bridlington-on-Sea.

Brazil's beaches may offer some stunning sights - but the UK has more fun, according to the survey

'But then we also have Monty Python, Mr Bean and The Office and are one of the world’s greatest exporters of comedy.'

         Country              Days having fun

Badoo asked 17,000, mainly young people in 17 countries and four continents: 'How often do you really have fun and a good time (such as when going out socially or seeing friends?)'

The British came eighth of the 17 nationalities ranked. While we have slightly more fun than both the Brazilians and the French, and race ahead of the Polish, who have least fun of anyone.

Among the study’s other surprise findings is that the supposedly fun-shy Germans in fact report having more fun (12.1 days a month) than do the famously fun-loving Brazilians (10.9 days) or us (11.3).

Americans come to a respectable sixth in the world rankings. Young Americans average nearly 12 days (11.7) of fun a month.

This places them ahead of Canadians, their neighbours to the north, on 10 (9.9) days, and of us, but well behind Mexicans, their southern neighbours, on nearly 14 (13.7) days.

A 'happiness map of Britain' shows how mothers living in the UK's most remote spots are among the happiest people in the country - as a study in November found women are generally more content than men.

The report also showed women appear to experience more anxiety and found geographical ‘hotspots’ where people could expect a better life, singling out the Outer Hebrides, Orkney and Shetland.

Those based in London, Luton and Reading were deemed to have the lowest well-being in the UK, the New Economics Foundation (NEF) think-tank report found.
