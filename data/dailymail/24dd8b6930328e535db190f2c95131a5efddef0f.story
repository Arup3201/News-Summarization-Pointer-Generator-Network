The food watchdog has issued a warning about the dangers of giving unpasteurised milk to children 

The food watchdog has issued a warning about giving so-called raw milk to children after five youngsters were taken to hospital with E.coli poisoning.

The unpasteurised milk has become trendy among celebrity food writers and other advocates of unprocessed ‘raw food’, who claim it is both tastier and healthier.

However, consumers are putting themselves at risk because the milk is not heat treated to remove dangerous bugs.

The Food Standards Agency said there have been incidents on three farms selling raw milk in recent weeks which led to E.coli poisoning in five children aged one to 12 and one adult aged 28.

The watchdog has now suspended sales of raw cows’ drinking milk and any product made from the milk, including cheese, at all three farms.

FSA chief operating officer, Andrew Rhodes, said: ‘Older people, infants, children, pregnant women and those with weakened immune systems are particularly vulnerable to food poisoning and these groups should not be consuming raw drinking milk because it hasn’t been heat treated.’

E.coli, which is found in the faeces of cows, is most likely to cause contamination during the milking process. In worst-case scenarios, the bug can cause severe diarrhoea, kidney failure – even death.

In August, two children aged ten and 12, fell ill with E.coli after drinking raw milk sold by Barton Farm Dairy, an organic establishment in Barnstaple, Devon, which sells raw milk and cheeses online.

The FSA has refused to name the other two farms, which are believed to have been selling milk direct to smaller groups of local customers.

Raw milk has not been pasteurised by heat treatment.

All fresh milk sold in the high street is pasteurised – heated to 72C (162F) for 25 seconds. As well as killing E.coli, the process also eliminates campylobacter, salmonella and listeria.

Untreated raw milk is thicker with a distinctive creamy taste. But any harmful bugs on the body or udders of the cow that pass into the milk are not killed off. Cheese made from raw milk may contain these bugs.

Advocates of the product argue that pasteurisation removes important nutrients, such as folic acid.

They also claim raw milk is associated with reduced levels of asthma, hay fever and food allergies in children.

But US tests have shown that the nutrients in raw and pasteurised milk are the same.

One of these farms has been linked to E.coli poisoning of youngsters aged one, two, and five. 

The second farm, which is being investigated for a number of hygiene breaches and is not authorised to sell raw milk, has been linked to a food poisoning infection in a 28-year-old customer. 

All six became so ill that they needed hospital treatment.

The FSA said it is not able to name the two farms at present because evidence is still being gathered, and there is the possibility of a prosecution for selling raw milk without permission.

The sale of raw milk is banned in Scotland because of the risk to health but it is permitted in the rest of the country where farmers are allowed to sell direct to the public or over the internet.

The FSA has come under enormous pressure from raw milk campaigners in recent months to liberalise the sale of the product in the high street and through vending machines.

Shane Holland, of campaigning group Slow Food UK, said: ‘Data from the US show that raw milk is many thousands of times less likely to give you food poisoning than other commonly eaten foods not deemed “risky” by the FSA.’

Another supporter of raw milk is food writer Tom Parker Bowles who has described it as ‘rich, bounteous and fulsome’.
