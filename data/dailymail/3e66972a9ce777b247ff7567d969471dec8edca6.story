If ever proof were required that location is everything in the property business, this rather modest hut must be it.

Estate agents insist it has character, though at first glance it is hard to see. What’s more there’s no loo, no parking and it measures only 10ft by 10ft.

The one up, one down World War Two Gun House has already sold for £200,000.

If ever proof were needed that location is everything in the property business, this rather modest hut is proof

Despite there being no loo, no parking and it measures only 10ft by 10ft. The one up, one down World War Two Gun House has already sold for £200,000

It has no parking, loo or running water, just an outside tap.

But it is on Marine Parade in the highly fashionable seaside village of Shaldon in Devon and has permission to turn it into a one-bedroom holiday home.

Estate agent Katherine Edwards said: ‘It is the location that sold it and the views are amazing.

'We got a lot of interest from so 
many people up and down the country from people who wanted to use it as a
 second home or holiday let.

'It is a completely individual property which has a lot of character and will be used as a holiday home.'

The property, last used as an artist’s gallery, was built during the war and was topped with a searchlight and a small gun to protect the mouth of  the River Teign.

The Gun House (circled) was originally used as a guard room topped with a search light and small gun used as part of the coastal defences in Shaldon, Devon

It was originally used as a guard room topped with a search light and small gun used as part of the Shaldon coastal defences.

But there is power to the property and a small outside area that, after landscaping, could provide space for a small table and chairs.

Shaldon is a highly desirable seaside village which attracts top prices. The five luxury beach 'huts' on The Strand were sold for up to £250,000 in 2011.

Ms Edwards said: 'Shaldon continues to be popular. It is right on the waterside and the village has a lovely community feel.

'It is starting to get a foodie reputation too with lots of restaurants and cafes and everyone says hello, even if they don't know you.

'That is what people like.'
