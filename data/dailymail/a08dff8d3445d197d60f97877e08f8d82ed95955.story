If you are afraid of burning the bird or being blamed for soggy sprouts don’t worry, you are not alone.

Despite over half of Britons (58 per cent) attempting to cook their first festive meal at 24 years old, they won’t have the annual feast fully mastered for a further 12 years, when they hit 36.  

So celebrities like Emma Bunton, or Bond girl, Naomie Harris, both in the prime of the Christmas dinner making skills at 36, should serve up the perfect turkey, according to research from supermarket Asda.

Don't stuff it up! It takes an average of 12 years practice to perfect the perfect Christmas feast

For over half of home cooks (51 per cent), the trickiest part of the annual celebrations are the timings. The huge array of different courses, trimmings and varying cooking times makes the day a scheduling nightmare.

Making sure the meat is cooked to perfection is the most problematic part of the dinner for over a third of would-be chefs (37 per cent). Surprisingly, almost a fifth (18 per cent) admit to having bought their main Christmas meat without having checked whether it will fit in their oven first.

When it comes to learning the necessary Christmas dinner cooking skills, mum really does know best – 83 per cent  of people say their biggest cooking influence is their mother. However one in ten can’t cope with the thought of being responsible for the meal and say they will never even attempt to cook a Christmas dinner.

At 36 Emma Bunton should have perfected her turkey basting skills

The average Brit polishes off turkey and all the trimmings - and a spot of Christmas pudding - in just 30 minutes and 44 seconds after spending three hours and 30 minutes spent shopping for the food and a further 42 minutes in the kitchen cooking the meal.

TV chefs, who each claim to know the best way to prepare Christmas roast, inspire almost half (47 per cent) of cooks. However only 4 per cent  of people surveyed said that following celebrity chefs have actually made them a better cook.

It seems that practice and persistence is key, as 43 per cent of confident cooks say they’re self-taught, with 12 years being the optimum amount of rehearsal time.

Jim Viggars, Asda’s head of meat quality said: ‘The highlight of many people’s Christmas day is the food. But cooking the Christmas dinner shouldn’t give you beef.

‘The trick to avoid stuffing up is plenty of preparation. Use the days and weeks ahead of the 25th December to perfect each individual part, so you’re not panicking on the day. And if it doesn’t go to plan on the big day don’t worry, there’s always next year!’
