Japan's human rights ambassador told delegates in Geneva to 'shut up' in an angry outburst that has brought his career into question.

In a meeting of the U.N torture committee, Hideaki Ueda was filmed shouting after a delegate from Mauritius criticised the Japanese justice system.

Video footage shows Mr Ueda responding to questions about Japan's practice of not allowing criminal suspects to have defence lawyers with them during interrogation.

Row: Hideaki Ueda's outburst sparked online debate as to whether he should continue in his post as Japan's human rights ambassador

The clip was posted on YouTube and has been seen by thousands, with commentators saying Mr Ueda should be recalled to Japan, according to Agence France-Presse.

The Ambassador responded to his 
colleague by saying: 'Certainly Japan is not in the Middle Age(s). We 
are one of the most advanced countries in this field.'

When this defence was met with soft 
laughter in the room, Mr Ueda shouted: 'Donâ€™t laugh! Why you are 
laughing? Shut up! Shut up!'

After an uncomfortable pause the ambassador continues to defend his country.

Uncomfortable: The delegates endure an awkward moment after they are shouted at

He said: 'We are one of the most advanced countr(ies) in this field. That is our proud. Of course, there are still shortages, of course, shortcomings.

'Every country has shortages and shortcomings, but we are trying our best to improve our situation.'

Twitter users reacted to the footage saying Mr Ueda should be replaced because of his unprofessional conduct, reports Agence France-Presse.
