The BBC placed staff at its Radio 1 Teen Awards under draconian restrictions to prevent presenters being accused of sexual misconduct with minors.

All adults – including the station’s star DJ Nick Grimshaw – were banned from moving around Wembley Arena without a security guard and even needed an escort for visits to the lavatory.

The rules were so stringently enforced that guests referred to them as ‘Savile Lockdown’, in reference to the late paedophile BBC DJ Jimmy Savile.

Stringent: Parents had to sign a new consent form for the Radio 1 Teen Awards which said staff and artists would not be placed in a 'caring or supervisory position'. Guests referred to the rules as a 'Savile Lockdown'

The awards, for 14 to 17 year olds, took place at Wembley Arena on November 3. Performers on the night included Jessie J.

The event came just two days after it was revealed that BBC broadcaster Paul Gambaccini had become the 15th person to be arrested on suspicion of sexual offences as part of Operation Yewtree.

Jessie J was one of the artists who performed

A BBC source said: ‘Security staff even waited outside while we visited the bathroom, then ensured we were taken back to our seat without any detours.

‘It was made very clear that we were not to speak with any of the teenagers or engage with them on the stage. We called it the Savile Lockdown.’

The security measures taken at the event are among many hardline rules introduced as the BBC attempts to undo the damage caused to its reputation since it emerged that Savile spent years abusing children during his time working for the Corporation as a children’s presenter.

They include an update of its child consent forms. Parents of children who participate in any BBC show or project must now agree that they ‘will not leave any BBC staff or associate artists unaccompanied in the presence of a child or children’.

The form also insist that parents ensure that their child is told they must not ask any BBC staff for  contact details or hand over their own details to BBC staff. Parents dropping their children off at the Teen Awards were told to sign the updated form.

A BBC insider said: ‘It is a BBC policy that adults have to be escorted when they are around anyone who is under age.

‘Managers, photographers and producers all have an escort, even when they are in the studio or the office. The escorts themselves also have to go around in pairs so they have a back-up who can vouch for them if they find themselves in a difficult situation.

‘At the Teen Awards, BBC staff and escorts were told to stop an adult if they were walking around the venue alone and question them about what they were doing.

‘Parents were not allowed into the Arena and instead had to drop their children off at the door. After the Jimmy Savile saga, parents were more concerned than usual and security was tightened.’

As well as security guards, the BBC hired teams of Security Industry Authority-approved officers who were stationed around the arena.

A BBC spokesman said: ‘We take our duty of care towards this young audience extremely seriously and have a very clear process in place that states that the handful of adults who are allowed front-of-house must be accompanied at all times.’

The awards came two days after it was revealed broadcaster Paul Gambaccini, pictured, had been arrested on suspicion of sexual offences under Operation Yewtree. He issued a statement denying the 'historic' allegations
