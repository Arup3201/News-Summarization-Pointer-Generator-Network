Twenty-one cars were completely 
destroyed in a blaze at a long-stay car park close to Edinburgh Airport 
in the early hours of today.

The vehicles were parked in a row at the 2,000-space long-stay car park close to the terminal on the Lochend Industrial Estate in Newbridge.

The burnt out wrecks are said to include Vauxhalls, Renaults, a Mini and an expensive Audi.

Firefighters were alerted at around 1.16am, receiving reports that 10 cars were alight at the LowCostAirportParking.com site.

A fire tore through a long-stay car park at Edinburgh Airport in the early hours, destroying 21 cars parked while their owners enjoyed a holiday

Firefighters responding to a 999 call were told 10 vehicles had caught light at the LowCostAirportParking.com site close to the airport terminal in Newbridge. The blaze quickly engulfed 21 cars, leaving them completely destroyed

But the flames spread, engulfing a total of 21 cars.

A team of 10 firefighters from Sighthill tackled the flames, bringing the fire under control by 4.30am.

One onlooker said: 'There was every kind of car alight -- by the end you couldn't tell the difference between an Audi and a Vauxhall. They were all burned to a crisp. Â 

'Most of the owners will be on holiday -- they'll be devastated to come back to this. All the bonnets were blown up.

'It's just amazing that more cars weren't destroyed as the car park was full and they were tightly packed together.'

A Scottish Fire and Rescue Service Investigation Unit is attempting to determine the cause.

Police Scotland, who also attended the blaze, said that depending on the result they may also investigate.

A Fire Service spokeswoman said: 'We received a call at 1.16am reporting several cars alight at Lochend Industrial Estate at Newbridge.

'Appliances from Sighthill attended and found vehicles alight within the long stay car park. There were ten cars reported alight but it quickly spread from vehicle to vehicle. The final total was 21 affected.

While the burnt out vehicles were hardly recognisable, one eye-witness claims they include Vauxhalls, Renaults, a Mini and at least one expensive Audi

The eye-witness said the bonnets of most of the cars had blown off. A fire service investigation is underway to try and establish the cause of the blaze, as Police Scotland said they could not rule out an inquiry of their own

'Around ten firefighters used three lines of high pressure hose to extinguish the fires by 4.22am.

'A fire investigation is taking place to look at the circumstances.'

A Police Scotland spokesman said: 'We attended a fire at the Low Cost Parking company car park on Queen Anne Drive, Newbridge at around 1.30am after receiving a call from the Fire Service.

'Officers attended until the fire was extinguished. The Fire Service are currently leading the investigation.'

A spokeswoman for LowCostAirportParking said: 'I can confirm there was a fire in the car park at Newbridge. Fire Service Investigators are with us at the moment.

'Until we know what has happened we can't say any more.'
