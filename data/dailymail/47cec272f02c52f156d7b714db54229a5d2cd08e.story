As the Ebola virus continues to rip through west Africa, with more than 4,000 killed, Britain is sending hospital ship HMS Argus to help combat the deadly disease.

While this rescue mission is not set to arrive for several days, Captain Jim Masters, 86, has told of his experience being sent to fight the first Ebola outbreak in Africa in 1976.

Cpt Masters was serving in the army when word began spreading of a then-unknown virus killing thousands of villagers living along the Ebola river in Zaire - from where the disease takes its name.

Captain Jim Masters was leading expeditions across Africa in the Seventies when he was recruited to hand out medical supplies along the Ebola River in Zaire, where a then-unknown virus had killed thousands

The forces had no information on where the infection had come from or how it was being spread. All they knew was that it killed 90 per cent of those who became infected. 

Cpt Masters had previously lead an expedition down the Nile River, and was taking another mission into Zaire when he was recruited by the country's top doctor to help distribute medical supplies.

Dr Bill Close, personal physician to Congolese president Mobutu Sese Seko, asked him to go into the infection zone and help set up a quarantine zone. 

Masters' orders were to set up the zone, then fly a specialist U.S. medical team in by helicopter.

After the team were in, Cpt Masters was to keep the them supplied with whatever they needed, and help collect samples from victims to be sent back to the U.S. for analysis.

He said: 'I wasn’t really scared, mainly out of ignorance.

'One day I was sent for to be told that a deadly fever was killing hundreds of people in the Equateur Province, and was concentrated near a river called Ebola.

When Cpt Masters was sent to help contain the epidemic, nobody knew where the virus came from or how it was spread, they only knew it killed 90 per cent of those who became infected

'The sick were going to a Catholic mission hospital hoping to get help. Sadly at this stage, little could be done as the fever had no history. It was killing more than 90 per cent of those who contracted it.

'Dr Close had been aware of the true nature of the threat and sent for an investigative team from the United States.

'There was plenty of information about what was happening, but none on why. Its source and carriers were unknown.

'The fear was that it could spread into other areas, even to population centres like Kinshasa, the capital, and from there to anywhere in the world.'

It is believed that fruit bats were the original carriers of Ebola, but spread it to other animals such as chimpanzees, gorillas, monkeys, forest antelope and porcupines through bites or faeces.

The disease is then thought to have passed into humans through contact with the blood, bodily fluids, or dead bodies of infected animals found lying in the rainforest.

In humans the virus has an incubation period of between two and 21 days. Once a person begins to show symptoms they become infectious, and can spread the disease through blood or bodily fluids.

After several days in Zaire, Cpt Masters managed to set up supplies sub-depot in each of the country’s nine regions the affected area was put on lock-down.

He was asked to get the world’s leading experts to the centre of the epidemic - the Equateur Province - so chartered planes and army helicopters to Lisala.

The team arrived at the hospital staffed by Belgian and French Catholic missionaries and government staff.

He recalled: 'No air or river movements were permitted in or out of that part of Equateur and the almost impossible task of preventing overland movements was put in hand.

'Perhaps in a more developed part of the world this could not have been done successfully, but in Zaire the cordon was complete.

'My task was to get the team of researchers, including Dr Cal Johnson, one of the world’s leading experts on tropical fevers, to the site by plane and helicopter, keep them supplied with whatever they needed and to collect medical samples which would be flown to the US for further studies.

'There also needed to be a withdrawal system should things go badly wrong for the team, and one, or more, of their number be struck down with fever.

'I went in with the first team, taking a couple of my craftsmen to set up a field laboratory at the mission hospital.'

Speaking of the medics, he said: 'I was lost in admiration for them as already members of the staff had died at their posts from the effects of the fever.

'[The outbreak] left me with a lifelong admiration for those who battle sickness and disease.

'I came to realise that it is not just enough to find cures for the illnesses we already know about but to be on guard against the new developments which evolve with life itself.'
