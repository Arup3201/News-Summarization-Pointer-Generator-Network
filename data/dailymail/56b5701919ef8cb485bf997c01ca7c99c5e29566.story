A woman who was raped by Adrian Ernest Bayley has told of her terrifying encounter with the killer, 11 years before he attacked and murdered Jill Meagher. 

A sex worker who was raped and abandoned naked in a Melbourne street by Bayley detailed the horrific incident.

The woman said she had reached an agreement with Bayley, and got into a white van with him, according to the Herald Sun.

Adrian Bayley, 43, has been convicted of raping and attempting to rape 12 women from 1991 to 2012

He then punched her in the mouth and raped her, promising to kill her if she did not submit to his disgusting will.

He called her a 'f**king slut' and again threatened to kill her if she reported the attack.

Bayley reportedly then stripped her naked and dumped her in a lane-way.

The woman said she recognised Bayley immediately when the haunting CCTV footage of Jill Meagher flashed across her television screen.

A prison psychologist told Victoria County Court Bayley found pleasure in hurting and dominating his victims

'That's him...that's definitely him,' she reportedly said. 

Details of the attack emerged after Bayley's horrifying history with sexual assault and violence came to light. 

On Thursday, he was convicted of a further three rapes committed in 2000 and in the months before Ms Meagher died. 

The predator - who pleaded guilty to raping and murdering Jill Meagher in 2012 - with a gross sexual appetite may have understood his victims' fear. 

As a child, Bayley was abused physically and possibly sexually.

Bayley was born Adrian Ernest Edwards on July 14, 1971.

He grew up in Melbourne with four younger siblings and an abusive father, who once smashed his son's head through a wall.

Bayley told a prison psychologist he was also sexually abused from age nine to 15 by an older female, though this claim has not been verified.

 But he may have understood what his victims' pain as he was physically and possibly sexually abused

'There is certainly evidence of physical abuse - in my opinion, some evidence of the possibility of sexual abuse,' psychologist James Ogloff later told Victoria County Court.

Professor Ogloff believes Bayley's borderline personality disorder contributes to his impulsiveness and unstable self image.

Bayley fantasises about assuming power and control over his victims, and the psychologist believes he derives pleasure from inflicting pain.

His criminal record suggests this is the case. 

In total, Bayley has raped or attempted to rape 12 different women from 1991 to 2012. 

His first rape was committed just months after he walked down the isle in 1990, and a string of sexual assaults soon followed.

Bayley spent almost two years in prison before being released in 1993 when he trained as a pastry chef.

Bayley had two children with his first wife before they split. He married again, fathering another two children.

He changed his last name from Edwards to Bayley in 2000, but returned to violent sexual crimes.

In the early 2000s there were reports to police that a young, fit man was targeting prostitutes in St Kilda.

He would drive them to a laneway, park so his victims could not escape, and then brutally rape them.

When a judge jailed him in 2002, he said Bayley used threats and violence to satisfy his 'gross sexual appetite'.

Bayley was released on parole in 2010, and was working as a labourer in 2012 when he attacked again.

This time he killed Jill Meagher who was just 500 metres from her house when she was snatched, raped and brutally murdered by Bayley.

The trigger for the murder of Jill Meagher was that she disregarded him. 'She flipped me off,' Bayley told police, in an attempt to limit his responsibility, 'and that made me angry, because I was actually trying to do a nice thing', according to The Age.

But Prof Ogloff told the court Bayley did appear to be sorry.

The psychologist said it was quite common for people to be very remorseful, but to persist in engaging in that behaviour.

Bayley seems to agree with the professor's analysis.

'They should never have let me out,' Bayley told police after confessing to killing Ms Meagher.

'How many chances does a person need?'
