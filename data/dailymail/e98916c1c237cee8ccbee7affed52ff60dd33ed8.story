Boris Johnson has admitted to being pursued by the U.S. authorities for an unpaid tax demand.

The Conservative mayor of London - who was born in New York and holds an American passport -  revealed that he is refusing to pay a demand issued to him for capital gains tax. 

The demand reportedly relates to his first home in the UK, which he said was not subject to capital gains tax in England.

According to U.S. tax law all citizens are required to file a tax return and pay U.S. taxes, even those with dual citizenship and those who earned income abroad. 

Mr Johnson revealed he was being chased for the payment during an interview with National Public Radio during his visit to the country to promote his book about Winston Churchill, The Churchill Factor.

His initially unremarked upon claims, made on November 13, came after he was asked about renouncing his US citizenship, which the caller said was 'very hard'.

Mr Johnson said: 'I have to confess to you, that you're right, it is a very - it is very hard, but I will say this, the great United States of America does have some pretty tough rules, you know.

'You may not believe this but if you're an American citizen, America exercises this incredible doctrine of global taxation, so that even though tax rates in the UK are far higher and I'm Mayor of London, I pay all my tax in the UK and so I pay a much higher proportion of my income in tax than I would if I lived in America.

'The United States comes after me, would you believe it, for the - for capital gains tax on the sale of your first residence which is not taxable in Britain, but they're trying to hit me with some bill, can you believe it?'

Presenter Susan Page then pressed him whether he would pay the bill, to which he said: 'I think it's outrageous.

'Well, I'm - no is the answer. Why should I? I haven't lived in the United States for, you know, well, since I was five years old.

'I could but I pay - I pay the lion's share of my tax, I pay my taxes to the full in the United Kingdom where I live and work.'

The Telegraph reports the home, in Islington, north London, wa bought by Mr Johnson and his barrister wife  in 1999 for £470,000. They sold the house for £1.2million in 2009. 

While in the UK he would not have been liable for capital gains tax as residents do not pay it on the sale of their first home, Diane Gelon, a US tax and immigration lawyer told the paper he could be facing a bill of over £100,000 in the States.

Despite his reluctance to pay his own US tax bill, he has previously criticised the US embassy in London for not paying its unpaid congestion charge fine, the Guardian reports, which amounts to £7million.

According to U.S. income tax laws, the foreign-earned income exclusion threshold was set at $97,600 (£62,000) last year, which Mr Johnson would be liable to pay as he earns well above this.  

His mayoral salary is £144,000 and he is reportedly paid £250,000 a year for his Telegraph column.

The mayor's spokesman said he would not be commenting further. 

The Internal Revenue Service, the US government agency responsible for tax affairs, states on its website: 'If you are a US citizen or resident alien, the rules for filing income, estate, and gift tax returns and paying estimated tax are generally the same whether you are in the United States or abroad.

'Your worldwide income is subject to US income tax, regardless of where you reside.'
