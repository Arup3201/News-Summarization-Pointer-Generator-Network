A group of students protesting cuts to university funding  interrupted a wine delivery worth $1,152 at the Liberal Party headquarters in Melbourne.

Eight protesters stormed the Liberal Party building in Melbourne's CBD on Thursday morning just as a case of newly released red wine was delivered.

The $1,152 box of wine, which was only released for sale last month, was addressed to state director Damien Mantach.

The small but loud group of students had set up camp at the Liberal Party headquarters to protest against the federal government’s higher education reforms.

Students chanted 'no cuts, no fees, no corporate universities' for more than an hour, with police called in to remove them.

Police were called in and eventually gave the students 10 minutes to get out or face being arrested

They tore down photos of Prime Minister Tony Abbott and Premier Denis Napthine and even set one of them on fire, the Herald Sun reports.

Police eventually stepped in and told the protesters they had 10 minutes to leave or face being arrested.

But as they were preparing to leave another bottle of wine was delivered. The courier was told to return again later after the protesters had left.

As the small protest was taking place on Thursday, larger protests were held across the country against the government's changes to higher education reforms
