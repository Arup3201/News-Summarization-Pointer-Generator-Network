A couple have been reunited with their wedding photographs 18 months after their camera was buried under rubble during the 2011 Christchurch earthquake in New Zealand.

Martin Burley and his wife Fen thought pictures of their special day had been lost forever when their camera disappeared in the earthquake just one hour after they returned home from their honeymoon.

However, they were astonished to discover the device hidden under rubble in their driveway.

Reunited: This was one of the pictures of Martin and Fen Burley, taken on their wedding day, retrieved from their buried camera

Precious memories: One of the wedding photos from the couple's special day retrieved from the memory card

To their delight, although the camera had been destroyed, the memory card inside was still intact.

After only two attempts at trying to load the card's data, six months' worth of images were retrieved - including precious pictures of their wedding and honeymoon.

Mr Burley revealed how he spotted the camera poking through the gravel in their driveway.

He told New Zealand's Stuff: 'You could just see the outline and I thought, "What is that?". Then I looked closer and it was the camera.'

Well-hidden: The outline of the camera is just about visible in this picture of the couple's driveway after it was buried in silt

Salvaging the memories: The camera, left, after it was dug out of the ground and the retrieved data card, right

Surfaced: The couple believe the camera appeared at the top of the ground after recent bad weather in Christchurch 'churned up' the driveway

The couple's house was badly damaged 
in the 2011 quake and they believe the camera fell out of a bag as they 
rushed to evacuate their home.

At
first, they didn't notice the camera had gone but a few days later 
realised it must have been buried under the waist-high silt that covered
their driveway during the earthquake.

Mr
Burley added: 'We kind of just accepted it. We said, "OK, there's 
nothing we can do about it". We just put it out of our minds and carried
on.'

Overjoyed when discovering the camera
embedded in his driveway this week, My Burley told Stuff: 'I thought 
even though it was dead as a camera, maybe I can get the memory card out
of it.'

The couple believe the camera 
surfaced to the top of the ground after recent bad weather in 
Christchurch 'churned up' the driveway.
