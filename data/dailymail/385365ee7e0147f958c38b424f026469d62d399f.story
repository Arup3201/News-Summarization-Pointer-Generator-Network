A man has been left paralyzed after heroically diving into a creek to save a four-year-old girl from drowning.

Michael Patterson, 43, was visiting the Euharlee Creek in northwest Georgia with his son on Saturday when the girl was fragged underwater.

Authorities say the four-year-old had been playing in the creek and stepped into a section of deep water.

Patterson dove into the water and was able to rescue the girl but hit his head during the dive and broke his neck, paralyzing him instantly.

Devoted father: Michael Patterson, 43, has been hailed a hero after he dived into a creek to save a little girl and ended up paralyzed when he brok his neck

Tragic: Mr Patterson, who is in the ICU, was paralyzed the second that he hit the water and his young son witnessed him floating face down in the creek

He was taken to hospital and doctors say the man is now paralyzed from the chest down.

Mr Patterson's life-altering tragedy is heightened by the fact that he now faces massive medical bills - but does not have health insurance because he recently started a new job.

The father had jumped in as he feared for the safety of a little girl who was being swept away by the fast-flowing current.

Javea Jones was dragged under water, her mother Carlissa said, describing it as the worst moment of her life - until the Good Samaritan took action. She described Mr Patterson as a 'hero' and an 'angel'.

After he had saved her daughter, Mrs Jones said that she saw the man floating on top of the water.

Mr Patterson's nine-year-old son also witnessed the horrific moment that his father broke his neck on hitting the water.

Mr Patterson was pulled from the water by four men and given CPR until an ambulance arrived.

The 43-year-old is in intensive care at Redmond Medical Center in Rome where he has been made aware of his life-altering injuries.

Remarkably, it is the second time in two weeks that Mr Patterson has saved someone's life after pulling a truck driver to safety when his rig caught on fire.

Vicki Davis, Mr Patterson's mother, says he recently started a job installing sheet rock and doesn't have health insurance.

Mrs Davis told wsbtv.com: 'Pray and pray, and have a lot of faith. That's all I can do.'

She hopes that a medical fund can be established to help her hero son but as of yet nothing has been set up.
