Ed Miliband, who has been openly attacked by Labour MPs rattled by a fall in the party's ratings 

Ed Miliband has been openly attacked by Labour MPs rattled by a fall in the party’s ratings following David Cameron’s Tory conference speech.

John Mann said a poll conducted last week, which showed the Tories in the lead for the first time in nearly three years, should be a ‘wake-up call’ and accused his leader of ‘complacency’.

The poll was taken immediately after Mr Cameron’s pledge to cut taxes, and put the Tories on 35 per cent and Labour one point behind. In his outspoken remarks, Mr Mann said he hoped the results would galvanise Mr Miliband into improving his performance.

‘This highlights the extraordinary level of complacency that permeates the top of the party,’ said the Bassetlaw MP. 

‘It should serve as a massive wake-up call. Ed should get out and mix with real voters to discover what they really care about, and then come up with policies on immigration and the economy which genuinely resonate with the electorate.’

Mr Mann claimed that many backbenchers were infuriated by the so-called ‘35 per cent strategy’ – targeting core Labour supporters in order to get to that position in the polls and then rely on the party’s inbuilt advantage in the electoral system to deliver a small majority.

‘They seem to think we need just one more small push and we will limp over the line to victory,’ he added. 

Another Labour MP said: ‘If I were to put into words publicly what I think about Ed Miliband right now I would be kicked out of the party’.

Labour MPs left their party conference feeling gloomy about their Election prospects after a lacklustre speech by Mr Miliband, in which he forgot to mention either the deficit or immigration. By contrast, Tory MPs were buoyed by Mr Cameron’s confident performance and promise to deliver £7 billion in tax cuts.

Although Labour has been narrowly ahead in most polls until last week, Mr Miliband’s personal ratings on leadership and the economy are at rock bottom.

Yesterday, a former adviser to Tony Blair and Gordon Brown added his voice to the criticisms.

Patrick Diamond warned that simply appealing to Labour’s traditional voters and disillusioned Lib Dems could prevent the party from winning key marginal seats.

‘It is the Conservatives who look confident despite the pressure exerted by Ukip, while it is Labour that appears politically on the back foot,’ he said.

‘David Cameron has been forced to the Right, but he still appears determined to make a wide national appeal.’

Mr Diamond added: ‘Key figures in the Labour Party fear that the party is reaching the limits of the 35 per cent strategy, having inexplicably abandoned a One Nation agenda.

‘They worry that the 35 per cent strategy is damaging Labour in the English marginals.’
