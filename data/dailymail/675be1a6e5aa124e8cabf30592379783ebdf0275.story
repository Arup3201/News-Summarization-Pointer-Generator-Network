A memorial service was held on Caspersen Beach, Florida, on Saturday evening for the father and daughter who were killed last weekend after a plane crash-landed on the beach and hit them.

Ommy Irizarry and his daughter Oceana, 9, from Fort Stewart, Georgia, were walking along the Venice beach last Sunday when the 1972 Piper Cherokee plane made an emergency landing after reporting problems.

Neither pilot Karl Kokomoor, 57, or passenger David Theen, 60, were injured. After the crash Kokomoor released a statement that was read to local media by his family's pastor.

Nearly 100 people gathered to pay their respects on Caspersen Beach, Florida, on Saturday evening for the father and daughter who were killed last weekend after a plane crash-landed on the beach and hit them

‘The plane hit the water to rest with the nose down on the water's edge,’ the statement said. ‘It was only after I exited the plane did I realize there were people on the beach. I never saw them. I am deeply, deeply sorry.’

Nearly 100 people gathered to pay their respects during Saturday’s service which Pastor Tom Hodge of First Baptist Church of Venice began with a Bible passage from the Book of Psalms.

That was followed by four kilted members of the Braden River Pipers bagpipe band playing Amazing Grace, reports the Herald Tribune.

Close by stood Venice's American Legion Post 159 color guard, flags billowing in the windy air as they stood at attention in their white, black and gold uniforms.

Wedding anniversary: Staff Sgt. Ommy Irizarry, left with his wife Rebecca on their vacation and right in an Army handout, was remembered by friends as a hands-on, hardworking father of three

Tragic: This is the message Mr Irizarry 
posted to Facebook on Sunday morning, just hours before his death

The color guard presented a folded 
American flag in honor of Ommy Irizarry, a 36-year-old U.S. Army 
Sergeant First Class stationed at Fort Stewart.

Since the death of daughter Oceana, 9, on Monday, two GoFundMe.com fundraising campaigns have raised more than $17,000.

Ommy Irizarry had been celebrating his ninth anniversary with wife Rebecca.

His
 daughter was airlifted to All Children's Hospital in St. Petersburg. 
The Sarasota County Sheriff's Office said on Tuesday that they were 
notified by the medical examiner's office of the girl's death.

Oceana was about to enter fourth grade, the family said.

Fatal crash: The 1972 Piper Cherokee made an emergency landing on Caspersen Beach in Venice

Resting: The pilot of the 1972 Piper Cherokee and his passenger were uninjured in the crash landing

'Oceana
 was a beautiful, intelligent and kind-hearted little girl,' the 
statement said. 'She was a natural artist who loved to learn.'

Many of Ommy's photos on Facebook were of him, his wife Rebecca and their three children.

The family could be seen smiling on various beaches and playing in the water through the years.It was unclear how the plane or the debris hit the father and his daughter.

Officials say the pilot radioed the airport that he was having trouble and was planning to land on the beach.

'He's
 trying to make the airport,' a woman calling 911 from the airport said.
 'He says he's not going to make the airport. But he's going to be on 
the beach.'

Runway: The pilot indicated to air traffic controllers that he was going to use the hard sand bank on Caspersen Beach as a runway to land

In other 
911 calls, a family friend cried as she described the scene. Screams and
 wailing could be heard in the background. Another man told a dispatcher
 about the little girl's condition.

'She's breathing a little right now,' a man said. 'Rapid pulse and difficult breathing. She's unconscious.'

The National Transportation Safety Board was investigating.
