Friends of Boris Berezovsky have claimed that the Russian oligarch was strangled to death despite a post-mortem examination suggesting there was no evidence of a struggle.

The 67-year-old's body was discovered on the bathroom floor of a £20million Berkshire mansion on Saturday after a bodyguard became concerned and smashed the door open.

That member of security staff said he left the house at 10am to run errands which took until 3pm and when he returned he noticed several missed calls on Mr Berezovsky's mobile phone.

A pathologist said he died of injuries 'consistent with hanging', but sources suggest that he may have been murdered.

Last night, one family friend claimed 
Mr Berezovsky’s body showed ‘traces of him being strangled around the 
neck’.

Nikolay Glushkov, 67, said the tycoon’s former wife noticed marks
on his neck minutes after he was found dead, adding: ‘A scarf was 
there. There were traces of him being strangled around the neck.’

Family and friends raced to the 
bathroom and saw him lying fully clothed with a scarf by his side. They 
said there was no sign of blood.

The results of the post-mortem examination came as the storm of controversy surrounding the death raged on.

Experts in chemical, biological and 
nuclear emergencies also spent hours combing the house amid fears that 
Mr Berezovsky could have been poisoned by the Kremlin, but no radiation 
was found.

Another report claimed yesterday that detectives investigating the death did not find a suicide note.

Some friends continue to insist Mr 
Berezovsky was the victim of a professional hit for speaking out against
Vladimir Putin’s regime. Others believe he killed himself after 
becoming depressed over the loss of his wealth and status.

The mansion in Ascot where he was found is understood to be owned by his former wife Galina Besharova, 54.

Last night her close friend told the 
Mail: ‘Galina is very upset about Boris’s death, as are their children. 
She remained close to Boris after they split up and it was at her house 
that he died.

Claims: Berezovsky was said to have 'begged' Vladimir Putin to let him return to Russia after they fell out in 2000, and Kremlin insider Sergei Markov (right) has argued British spies may have killed him to protect secrets

‘She really does not want to talk 
about how he died. But there are many ways to induce what may appear to 
be a natural death like a heart attack.’

As speculation raged on  yesterday, an
adviser to Putin even claimed Mr Berezovsky may have been killed by 
British security services.

Using the inflammatory rhetoric of the
Cold War era, Sergei Markov said the tycoon was assassinated because he
knew too much about Western plots to undermine Putin and planned to 
trade this knowledge for a return to Russia.

Mr Markov, a former Russian
politician, said: ‘I cannot say no to the version that it was a murder 
committed by those who were scared Boris Berezovsky would go back to 
Putin’s side.

‘I do not exclude that the secret 
services joined this work. I think they may have guessed that Berezovsky
would give away all information, and they decided to get rid of him.

‘In the stock of modern secret 
services, there are many things . . . which can provoke a heart attack 
and a stroke, and experts will not diagnose it.’  He added: ‘There is no
trust for the British secret services.

‘After their participation in the plot
aimed at occupying Iraq, their role in the plot targeting the leader of
Libya, then  the plot aimed at knocking down the government in Syria, 
it is clear that their methods are highly dirty.’

Mr Markov denied speculation that a 
Russian hit squad could have been sent to kill Mr Berezovsky. ‘After 
all, there are civilised politicians in the Kremlin,’ he added. ‘They do
not use the methods of political murders.’

A senior detective said yesterday that there was currently ‘no evidence of third party involvement’ in the death.

Mr Berezovsky was thought to be on the
brink of financial ruin after losing a £3billion legal action against 
his former business partner, Chelsea football club owner Roman 
Abramovich.

He had also been facing another court 
battle brought by former girlfriend Elena Gorbunova, who had applied to 
the High Court to freeze his reported £200million assets.

In the 1980s and 1990s, Mr Berezovsky 
was one of the most powerful men in Russia and helped choose Putin as 
president. However, he emigrated to the UK in 2000 and became one of 
Putin’s fiercest critics.

He survived a number of assassination attempts, including a bomb in his car which decapitated his chauffeur.
