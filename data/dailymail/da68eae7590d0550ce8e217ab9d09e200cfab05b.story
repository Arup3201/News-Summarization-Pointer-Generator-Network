A retired British couple who attempted to take their own lives have been extradited to the US to face fraud charges, Scotland Yard said today.

Grandparents Paul and Sandra Dunham were handed over to US Marshals at Heathrow Terminal Four by officers from the Metropolitan Police’s Extradition Unit.

They left on a flight that departed around 2.15pm, police confirmed.

The couple, both 58, were remanded in custody at Westminster Magistrates’ Court on Friday after Senior District Judge Howard Riddle concluded they had take a drugs overdose to avoid or delay their extradition.

Charges: Paul and Sandra Dunham, from Northampton, have been extradited to the US, police confirmed

House: The Dunhams were found by police officers at their detached home in Northampton last week

This morning their solicitors, extradition specialists Kaim Todner, confirmed the couple were set to be extradited to Maryland.

It is understood Mr Dunham, who is accused of over-claiming £600,000 expenses from an American firm, is in Wandsworth prison, while Mrs Dunham, who is accused of aiding and abetting, is in HMP Holloway.

The couple lost a High Court battle last month against extradition to stand trial over fraud charges relating to Mr Dunham’s company, Pace.

The failed High Court case heard Mr 
Dunham had suffered several mini-strokes and mental health problems, and
 Mrs Dunham was suffering from depression.

Mr Dunham, who was chief executive, president and a 20 per cent shareholder in the American company, which manufactured soldering irons for the electronics industry, was indicted on 13 counts of fraud and money laundering by a grand jury in Greenbelt, Maryland, in December 2011.

Mrs Dunham is accused of eight counts of fraud for allegedly aiding and abetting him. The couple deny any wrongdoing.

Search: Journalists expecting the Dunhams to give a statement called police when they did not appear

Court: The British couple were rushed to hospital after they were overdosed on medication at home last week

Journalists due to take a statement outside the Dunhams’ property in Northampton last Thursday alerted police when the couple did not answer the door.

Officers forced the door open and contacted paramedics, who arrived in two ambulances and took the couple to Northampton General Hospital, where they spent the night.

The couple, who have five grandchildren, said they attempted the suicide pact after being told Theresa May had cancelled a planned meeting with their MP Andrea Leadsom.

The case has caused anger over the use of the Extradition Act to haul them across the Atlantic for trial for what their supporters say amounts to a civil dispute.

The couple’s solicitor, Karen Todner, said she believed the extradition would happen today, and criticised the British government for allowing it.

She added:
 'Mr and Mrs Dunham are a hard-working couple from Northamptonshire who 
strenuously deny the allegations against them. Nevertheless, this 
country is forcibly sending them to America to face trial in a justice 
system where plea arrangements are effectively forced upon people.

Controversy: The Dunhams' case has caused anger over the use of the Extradition Act to haul them across the Atlantic for what some say is a civil case

'I understand David Cameron has recently stated that the Abu Hamza conviction shows that we ought to be extraditing people to America with greater expedition.

'What in fact this case shows is that Mr Abu Hamza should have stood trial in the United Kingdom and faced British justice.

'How many people like Mr and Mrs Dunham have to be extradited before this Government will uphold the promises they made whilst in opposition to change this treaty with America?'

Last week, Mr Dunham spoke from his hospital bed of his despair at being taken to America.

He said: ‘White collar crime has a 98 per cent chance of going to a plea bargain, so... somewhere down the line someone is either going to offer us a ridiculously long prison sentence or a plea bargain.

'We could easily be in the U.S. for six or eight years, [meaning] we would return to the UK in our mid-sixties, with no money, no jobs and no home.

'Frankly that was a prospect we didn’t feel like enduring eight years of hell for.'
