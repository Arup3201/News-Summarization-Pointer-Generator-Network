There was nothing shy about Australia's tennis hotshot Nick Kyrgios and the newly single Victoria Azarenka during their flirty exchange last night.

The pair sent playful tweets to each other, which excited fans and questioned whether this could be a new match made in heaven.

Although Azarenka split from boyfriend and X Factor judge Redfoo just four months ago, she seems to be back on the prowl - Kyrgios being her number one target.

It all began when the tennis prowess posted an intriguing tweet on Wednesday night.

'That Aussie accent is just sexy,' she wrote.

This prompted the 19-year-old Aussie to respond with: 'That Belarusian accent is just as sexy'.

And so it continued.

Kyrgios, who's rose to fame after beating Rafael Nadal in the fourth round of Wimbledon this year, then tweeted to the Belarusian champion: 'you're cute mate' and called her his 'homie'.

One particularly amused onlooker already had a couple name in mind for the pair.

The 25-year-old posted this tweet on Thursday night which gained over 230 retweets

'Look at Nickarenka over here,' Enis wrote.

This caught the attention of 25-year-old Azarenka.

'Oh my goodness that is like a doubles team name,' she wrote, retweeting Enis' post.

A fan was so keen to get 'Nickarenka' together, that he offered to pay for their dinner date.

'You guys should go out in a date. I'll pay the dinner!' Felipe wrote.

Kyrgios, who grew up in Canberra, has kept quiet about his love interests up until now. 

Wimbledon champion Andy Murray dubbed the teen as the 'next big Aussie star'.
