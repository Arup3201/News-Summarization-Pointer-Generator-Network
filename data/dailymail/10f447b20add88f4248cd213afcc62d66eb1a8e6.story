Six-year-old Lilly Bailey-Deacon was thrown off her bike and caught around the neck by a wire that was strung up in Titchfield Common, Fareham, Hampshire

A six-year-old girl was caught around the neck and 'nearly decapitated' by a wire that was deliberately strung across a park footpath.

Lilly Bailey-Deacon had been cycling with her grandparents in Fareham, Hampshire, when she rode into the wire and was  thrown from her bike.

She has been left badly shaken with cuts and bruises around her neck after the incident, which happened last Thursday.

The wire, a brake cable taken from a vandalised child’s bicycle, had been tied about three feet off the floor and stretched for eight feet between a park bench and  railings in Titchfield Common.

Lilly's furious father, Bradley Deacon, 29, from Havant, Hampshire, said he was 'livid' and issued an urgent plea to find the culprits.

'When you get a phone call to say that your daughter has nearly been decapitated by some stupid idiot, you're bound to be upset,' said Mr Deacon.

'I can't believe that someone could do something so stupid.

'I understand that kids play pranks but stringing up a wire like that is dangerous.

'I hope they catch whoever is responsible so that it doesn't happen again.' 

Two teenage boys sitting by Bellfield Play Area in Titchfield Common denied putting the cable up but left the scene when police were called.

Lilly said she is healing but is nervous about going on her bike.

She said: 'It was scary. It got me by the neck and it hurt. It was actually really dangerous. It could have cut someone's head off. It was horrible.'

Her mother Emma McSwiggan, 28, said she was 'out of her mind' with worry when she got the news.

The nurse, said: 'I was completely shocked and then it made me angry.

'I hope whoever did this gets caught so they get the warning they need to stop something like this happening to somebody else.'

After a trip to see the animals at a local pet shop, Lilly had asked if she could cycle on ahead of her grandparents and they agreed. 

Her grandfather Bradley Deacon Snr, 50, said: 'There's no roads through the park and the path is wide, so I said - Yes, but be careful and we'll catch you up.'

'Lilly went off on her bike laughing and giggling, but as she turned around a corner I could suddenly hear tears.

'I thought 'oh God, she's come off her bike' but no, to our horror, it was even worse.

'She had ridden into a brake cable that had been stretched across the path deliberately, in my view, with the intention to hurt someone.

'She'd got back up off the floor but was in a lot of pain and there's now a mark around her neck.

'I know youngsters like to play pranks but stringing up a wire cable you can't see is disgusting and dangerous.

'Lilly loves her bike and this was a terrible thing to do that could ruin a little girl's summer holiday and put her off cycling.'

After tending to Lilly, Mr Deacon Snr, from Titchfield Common set about warning others using the path.

He helped police remove the wire, which was about three feet off the floor and stretched for eight feet.

Now he is urging the two teenagers he spoke to sitting near the scene to come forward to help police catch whoever strung the wire up.

He said: 'We need anyone with any information to come forward so we can bring the culprits to justice.

'This was not a prank, it was a serious attempt to hurt someone for fun and that's unacceptable.'

Hampshire Police are appealing for information about the incident, which took place between 4.10pm and 4.55pm on Thursday.

PC Jim Heath wants to stop the 'dangerous' situation happening again and echoed Mr Deacon's plea.

He said: 'I'm very keen to trace those responsible to ensure there is no repeat incident and make them aware of how dangerous this could've been.'

Police want to speak to anyone in the park who may have seen someone fixing the cable in place or tampering with the abandoned child's BMX.

They also believe two boys aged around 15 or 16 sitting in the play park at the time may hold 'vital information' and urged them to come forward.
