Carnival Cruise Lines is making its return to Europe next year with a new ship that boasts the world’s first IMAX cinema at sea, a unique high-altitude cycling track, and the Florida-based company’s first on-board brewery.

The Vista cruise ship will launch May 1, 2016, with a 13-day Mediterranean cruise from Trieste, Italy to Barcelona, ending the company’s three-year absence on the continent.

At 133,500 tons and 1,055ft in length, Vista will become the largest ship in Carnival’s fleet when it departs on its maiden voyage with up to 4,000 passengers on board.

After the inaugural cruise she will sail all over the Mediterranean for five months before relocating to New York with a 13-day transatlantic voyage in October and November 2016.

Vista was designed to make the most of its outdoor space and provide exhilarating new activities for guests, and the cruise line is billing it as its most innovative ship ever.

Among them is an IMAX cinema – a cruise ship first – featuring a massive screen that is three decks high. It will display the latest Hollywood blockbusters, classic films and documentaries for guests who are looking for a break from the sun or want to unwind at night.

For adventurous types the ship’s marquee feature is the SkyRide, an 800ft cycling track that is suspended over an upper deck with panoramic views 150ft above the sea.

Passengers will climb aboard hanging recumbent-like bicycles and pedal around the open-air course.

Passengers will zip along the 455ft Kaleid-O-Slide on one- or two-person rafts, hitting twists and turns with kaleidoscopic visual effects

As for accommodation the ship features a wider variety of staterooms and two new accommodation classes: Havana Cabanas and Family Harbour.

Havana Cabanas come with private outdoor patios and sea views, while the Family Harbour section has deluxe ocean-view, balcony and interior staterooms with enough space for five people.

Erin Johnson, Carnival’s managing director for the UK and Ireland, said: ‘It is really exciting to be back in Europe for 2016. The Caribbean is of course still a priority for us, but we are really happy to be sailing out of Europe again as we felt it made sense for us to offer a full European season to our customers in the UK and further afield.

‘The high-altitude sky ride and world’s first IMAX at sea will bring something new and exciting to the cruise industry and we believe the compelling itineraries will attract a strong base of repeaters and new to cruise.’
