A four-girl burglary gang broke into homes stealing cash and jewellery to fuel their addictions to the prescription painkiller Oxycotin, police claim.

Samantha Smith, 19, Brandy Kinney, 19, Alyssa Conrad, 23, and Caroline Catarzi, 20, have been arrested and charged with carrying out burglaries on at least 20 residences in Southgate near Sarasota, Florida.

According to deputies they would knock on doors and, if there was no answer, head round the back and break in through a window.

Sarasota Police Captain Paul Sutton told Tampa Bay's Ten News: 'They had an issue with prescription pills.

'All four abused prescription pills and they were committing these burglaries to support their habit.'

The gang are suspected of suspected of committing at least 20 burglaries over the past two weeks.

Smith and Kinney are charged with five counts of burglary while Conrad and Catarzi are charged with five counts of burglary as well as one count of fraud and one count of dealing in stolen property after allegedly giving false information to a pawn broker.

The sheriff's office said the women are 
also suspects in a number of other burglaries currently being

One of their victims, Jeanette Schwaed, who has a five-year-old adopted daughter Jocelyn told Ten News: 'I noticed this odd thing sticking out of my curtains in my bedroom and I thought, "Wow that's odd," and I noticed that the screen has been mashed.

'I would really love the opportunity to speak with them and tell them what this did to my little girl. It's much more far-reaching than they realize," said Schwaed.
