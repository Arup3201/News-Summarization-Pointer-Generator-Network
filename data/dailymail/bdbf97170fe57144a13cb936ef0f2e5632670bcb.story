West Ham youngster Elliot Lee joined Southend on a three-month loan deal but lasted just 35 minutes of his first training session before picking up an injury.

The 19-year-old, who is allowed to play in the FA Cup for his loan club, suffered a hamstring injury and was forced to return to West Ham for tests. Lee is likely to discover the result of those tests on Tuesday. 

'Elliot came to us fully fit but 35 minutes in to his first session he pulled up with a muscle strain,' Blues boss Phil Brown told the Southend Echo.

Lee is back at West Ham for tests but says he hopes to return to the League One club soon

'He's gone back to get that assessed at West Ham and will have a scan today. That will tell us more but hopefully it won't be too bad.'

Lee tweeted to say he was 'gutted' about the injury but was hopeful he would be back at Southend soon.

Lee was loaned out to Colchester United last season where he played four times, scoring once.
