The Abbott government is preparing to cancel the passports of a number of suspected allies of the Islamic State.

Counter terrorism teams are said to be intercepting  suspects at Australian airports on a daily basis, after Prime Minister Tony Abbott raised the terror threat in Australia to high last week for the first time in history.

The Government believes there is a growing number of Australians travelling to join the Insurgency in Iraq and Syria, despite warnings they will face jail sentences if they return  to Australia.

Foreign Affairs Minister Julie Bishop told The Courier Mail that more than one passport is being cancelled a week.

'I can confirm I have cancelled three passports in the past week, four this month, and seized one foreign passport this week for security reasons.'

'Since July 1, 2013, a total of 55 passports were cancelled. About 45 have been done by me.' 

These figures are set to rise when the Government introduces tough new terror laws in the next Parliamentary sittings.

The planned legislations will make it easier for the Government to cancel passports and suspend foreign passports for those with dual citizenship.

This week, the first Australian troops have flown to the Middle East in preparation for strikes against the Islamic State.

The group of Special Air Service soldiers flew in secret from the RAAF base in northwest Sydney, headed for an operating base in the United Arab Emirates. The soldiers will be based there until they are called upon by the United States to begin strikes against the Islamic insurgents.

Prime Minister Tony Abbott has recently sent a clear warning to Australian citizens fighting with the Islamic State that if they are killed by fire from Australian fighter jets:

'They knew the risks, they took their chances, they broke Australian law, they are doing something which is a very serious offence under Australian law.

Mr Abbott added that Australian defectors were one of the motives for this weeks campaign. 'It was one of the principle reasons for committing to the anti-ISIL fight, that there are Australians there in significant numbers who wish to do us harm.'
