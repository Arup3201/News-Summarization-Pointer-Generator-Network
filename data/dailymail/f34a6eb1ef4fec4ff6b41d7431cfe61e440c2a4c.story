Carl Froch is a man on death row according to George Groves, who plans to be his public executioner at Wembley in their Battle of Britain.

That provocative description of Froch on the eve of their Wembley showdown was just about the only nasty moment of their final media confrontation before they duel for the world super-middleweight championship.

Groves is unconcerned that such a remark, in the context of the dangerous old game of prize fighting, might be frowned upon.

The fight game is a brutal sport, with two warriors attempting to land the knockout blow. At its best, it can provide epic sporting drama, demanding fitness, skill and bravery.

Fighting talk to sell tickets is as old as the Queensbury Rules but why must modern fighters, obsessed with boosting pay-per-view numbers for their television paymasters, resort to such puerile rhetoric?

Talk by George Groves that his champion opponent Carl Froch is on ‘death row’ is unedifying and insulting.

Groves may be confident. Groves may feel he can win. But this trash talk should have no place in a sporting arena. He is using the language of a loser.

He used the analogy to reinforce his belief that the Nottingham Cobra is about to be hit by the enormity of the biggest fight to take place in post-war Britain.

Groves says, ‘Hit he will be, by the scale of the event as he comes out and by the left hook with which I predict I will knock him out.

‘He is like a man on death row because he knows what’s coming… his hour of destiny.

’I say everything for a reason. It’s all considered. I don’t worry what people think, that they sometimes mistake my self-confidence for being too cocky. As for me, I’m never nervous before or during a fight. I’m always calm and composed – and even more so now because both Carl and I know that this is a fight he can’t win.’

Froch responded in a less outrageous manner, saying: ‘Yeah, I’m apprehensive but not because of George. This is a huge event in which I want to perform in a way that will show the world what I can do.

‘That’s the pressure on me but I always perform at my best under pressure.’

Groves insists that, for the most part, 
he called a halt to the mind games with which he angered and unsettled 
Froch before their first fight ‘because I don’t want to upset him 
any more’.

He added: ‘I want to keep him in a quiet place to think about what’s coming.’

Froch
 retorted:  ‘I saw George somewhat subdued and perhaps it’s getting to 
him now. He didn’t say a word to me so was unusually quiet.

‘It
 can be like that before you go against a great fighter. It was like 
that for me when I boxed Jermaine Taylor in America. I was super 
confident in the weeks leading up to the fight and then came the main 
press conference – like this one – and it suddenly dawned on me what a 
terrific champion I was about to face. I was right about that, having to
 get off the floor to win by knocking him out in the last minute.’

Groves
 did stir the pot a little more by reiterating his opinion of Froch as a
 technically deficient boxer and putting some of the blame for that on 
his renowned trainer Rob McCracken.

He
 said: ‘McCracken is a good trainer but Carl ignores his instructions 
once the fight warms up and like most boxers reverts to type in a 
crisis. I think it’s possible that Rob is so aware of Carl’s reputation 
as a warrior who can take shots and still win that he has neglected 
working on his technical skills.’

Man in the hat: Froch responded by criticising Groves' trainer Paddy Fitzpatrick's professional record

In your corner: Promoter Eddie Hearn (centre) is backing his man Froch to beat Groves for a second time

McCracken
 had a distinguished ring career of his own and is also head coach of 
the GB boxing team, which he steered to a medal haul at the London 
Olympics.

Froch was quick to
 contrast McCracken’s record of 33 wins against only one defeat in the 
course of winning British and Commonwealth titles with the background of
 Groves’ trainer Paddy Fitzpatrick.

Froch
 said: ‘I don’t pay much attention to Paddy Ritzcracker. He 
had just five professional fights. And while I respect any man brave 
enough to get in the ring, his record is five fights, five defeats, 
three of them by the big KO.

‘I
 trust Rob absolutely and he is bringing me to this fight, at 36 years 
of age, back to the best physical and mental condition I’ve ever been in
 my career.’

In rebuttal, of
 the Groves predictions of easy victory, Froch said: ‘First it was going
 to be three rounds, then it might be five, now it’s going to be the 
left hook instead of the big right he knocked me down with in the first 
round of our last fight.

‘I don’t listen to his nonsense either.’

Enter the champion: Froch makes his way into the final press conference at Wembley on Thursday

Fighting talk: Groves and Froch are both confident of knocking each other out at the national stadium

Each
 man is envisaging a one-sided fight in his favour, which may not be to 
the expectations of the biggest fight crowd in this country since the 
war if one of them proves himself right.

While
 Froch has rejected a request from promoter Eddie Hearn to consider an 
appearance at the England vs Peru pre-World Cup friendly on this Wembley
 turf 24 hours before the fight, Groves will attend the match.

Hearn
 had been keen to help boost the Sky pay-per-view sales by having both 
combatants appear on the pitch at half time.

Permission for Groves to do
 that may not be granted if ITV, who are broadcasting the football, deny
 their rivals such a promotional opportunity during their transmission.
