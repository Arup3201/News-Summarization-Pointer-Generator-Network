His name is Snuffles and all he wants is a loving family to take him into a new home.

But it seems when potential owners see him, they turn their noses up.

Why? Because this particular pooch has two noses.

Unfortunate: Snuffles is struggling to find a home because of his peculiar facial feature

The unfortunate dog, who is a Belgian Shepherd, is currently being looked after by staff at the Dog's Rehoming Centre in Uddingston, Glasgow.

The German Shepherd cross was handed 
to the centre by the local dog warden, and staff at the trust are 
worried his bizarre looks will get him overlooked.

He has a rare congenital defect which gives him the appearance of having two noses.

Vet Angela McAllister said: 'Instead of his nostrils being fused together he's got some sort of split there.

'It's a defect in his palate which gives him the appearance of having two noses as his nostrils can move completely independently of each other.

'I've never seen the condition in my 20-year career.'

As
 other dogs around him are rehomed, he is struggling to attract a new 
owner, despite being at the centre for more than a month.

He is only four-months old and has already been in four previous 
homes in his short life.

But he has been given an endearing name by staff to make him feel at home.

Striking: The dog has four nostrils, an attribute potential owners seem to dislike when they see Snuffles

Supportive: Staff at the care home gave him the endearing name because of his odd appearance

To add to his unique appearance Snuffles can also move both noses independently of each other.

The centre's manager Sandra Lawton said: 'We take in hundreds of dogs of all shapes and sizes but I have never seen anything quite like Snuffles.

'It is such a shame to think that this sweet-natured lad may not find the loving home he deserves just because he may not be considered a pretty pooch.

Turning their noses up: When owners look down at the German Shephard cross, they see his weirdly partitioned nose

While other dogs have more success when it comes to finding a new home at the Dogs Trust centre, Snuffles has found it tough

Obedient: Staff at the centre say Snuffles would be a perfect dog to train

'He is an affectionate, energetic 
fun-loving boy who adores his carers. He needs an active family and 
could live with a compatible dog and children over the age of 14.

'He may not have been blessed with the looks of Lassie but he has a heart of gold and really can claim to be a dog in several million."

Emma Louise Livingstone, supporter relations officer at the Dog's Trust said: 'He is just a typical, fun, bouncy puppy.

'He is very keen to learn and would be perfect to train up for any potential owner.'

Young: The puppy is only four months old, but has already been rehomed four times

Desperate: Staff said he was just a 'typical,. bouncy puppy' who really wanted to find a home

Homeless: He was handed into the centre by his former owner

Things looking up? Staff at the centre say he is an energetic puppy, despite failing to attract an owner

The deformed calf which was born with two heads in Morocco

The piglet from Changtai County in southern China's Fujian Province was born with three eyes and two mouths

In December, a village in northern Morocco was shocked by the birth of a two-headed calf.

The young animal was named Sana Saida, which means 'Happy New Year' in Arabic.

After its birth, the creature attracted a lot of attention, with 
locals of Sefrou, a village less than 20 miles from Fez, flocking to the
 farm to see it.

The calf is known as polycephalic, which means having more than one head.

Just a few days earlier, a two-headed piglet came into the world among a litter of 10 that was born in Nanchang, capital of eastern China's Jiangxi Province.

Unfortunately for the animal, vets said it would find it very hard to survive with the mutation.

In June, the San Antonio Zoo in Texas also welcomed a bizarre addition - a two-headed turtle they named Thelma and Louise.

The
 female Texas cooter was born with four others on June 18 displayed at the zoo's Friedrich Aquarium - swimming and walking as 
normally as her one-headed brothers and sisters.

The condition is supposedly common among snakes and turtles.

In 2011, a piglet from Changtai County in southern China's Fujian Province was been born with three eyes and two mouths. 

Xiao
 Jintu, owner of a local pig farm, said the piglet was one from a 
12-strong litter.

'It came out 5th and I was stunned in seeing its 
appearance', he said.

In 2009, a snake with two heads was 
found in a drawer full of rubbish in the US, while a cat suffering the 
same deformity was born in Australia a year earlier.

In 2008, Fisherman Christopher Johnson found a pregnant bull shark in the Indian Ocean.

When he cut it's stomach open, he found a foetus of a two-headed baby inside.

Scientists said it was the first time the condition has been seen in a shark.
