Fears that Argentina captain Lionel Messi had sustained a foot injury during Barcelona's 2-1 win over Real Madrid in El Clasico have been allayed by his club.

Barcelona said Messi was fit to remain with Argentina in Washington for their Copa America warm-up friendly against El Salvador on Saturday.

'FC Barcelona's medical staff in consultation with their counterparts at the Argentine Football Federation confirm that the tests carried out on Leo Messi whilst on international duty with the Argentine national side in Washington D.C. show that he has no injury to his right foot where he received a blow in his last league match with the blaugranas against Real Madrid,' the club said on their website.

Argentina, preparing for the Copa America in Chile from June 11-July 4, have another friendly against Ecuador in New Jersey next Tuesday. 

Meanwhile, Argentina head coach Gerardo Martino has complained about the scheduling of the European Champions League final which could involve a number of his players five days before the Copa America kicks off.

The Champions League final in Berlin is scheduled for June 6 and a large number of South American internationals play for the eight clubs that have reached the quarter-finals.

'We need to have the players from the first day and they are very keen to take part in the Copa America but they are also going to want to play the Champions League final after preparing all year,' Martino said.

'It's going to be a tough decision, the fact I don't have to take it (yet) is because we haven't got there yet. Martino told a news conference at Argentine FA headquarters.

'It seems to me that little thought is given to the needs of what happens on this side of the world,' he said in a veiled dig at European body UEFA.'
