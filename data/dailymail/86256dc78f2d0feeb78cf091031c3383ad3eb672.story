Foreign Affairs Minister Julie Bishop has squared up to Russian President Vladimir Putin about the MH17 investigations on the sidelines of a summit in Milan.

Ms Bishop met with Mr Putin on Friday at the ASEM summit in Milan, where she said the Netherlands-based scientists identifying the victims of the crash require further visits to the site before winter.

Sydney Morning Herald has reported that Mr Putin agreed to help scientists return to the site, as well as assisting with the investigations into what was behind the crash.

The unofficial meeting comes just days after Prime Minister Tony Abbott said he would 'shirt-front' his Russian counterpart at the forthcoming G20 summit in Brisbane. 

The MH17 site is still too dangerous to access, with reports that a small team of observers were met with gunfire there earlier this week.

In July, Malaysian Airlines flight 17 was shot down by a missile in rebel-controlled eastern Ukraine, killing all 298 people on board, including 38 Australian citizens and residents.

The investigations have been hampered by limited access to the site, which is controlled by Moscow-backed Ukrainian rebels.

Ms Bishop had formerly tried to raise the issue with Russia's Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov at the summit, but was met with disregard when he said it was 'a matter for Ukraine'.

'It is very frustrating but it has been very frustrating throughout... on the ground in eastern Ukraine the rebels from time to time have prevented access to the site, so what Russia says in the international arena is not always carried through on the ground,' Ms Bishop told Sydney Morning Herald. 

She said the investigations must be executed before the heavy snow typical of Ukrainian winter bury the site and hamper the situation further.

Bishop says the investigations must be executed before the heavy snow typical of Ukrainian winter bury the site and hamper investigations.

The news comes after Prime Minister Tony Abbott saying he would use next months Brisbane G20 summit to 'shirtfront' Putin over the MH17 investigations- a reference to a high contact Australian Football tackle.

Russian Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev responded to the comment by advising Abbott to  'choose his words carefully'.

Abbott was slammed in the Russian media, with one Pravda journalist claiming he was 'a disturbed mind crying out for therapy.'

The two leaders are scheduled to meet at the Brisbane G20 summit on November 15-16.
