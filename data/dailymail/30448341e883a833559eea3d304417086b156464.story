Takeaway curries might be tempting, but they may not contains the perfect ratio of ingredients.

A physicist has revealed a complicated formula for the most satisfying curry by examining the key ingredients in all types of the popular dish.

Dr Mark Hadley said the ideal curry must pass the 'fork test' so that every forkful and mouthful contains all the key ingredients in equal measure.

Dr Hadley said that based on a 27cm plate size, the perfect meal requires a 23cm diameter bed of rice just 5mm thick, which supports a low dome of curry that is 14cm in diameter and is 2.4cm high at the tallest point

Dr Hadley, from the Department of Physics at the University of 
Warwick said every forkful of curry should include meat or vegetable, sauce and rice in a ratio of 1:1:1.

The golden ratio, which dates back to Ancient Greece, is said to be the most aesthetically pleasing, while satisfying taste and texture when it comes to certain foods.

According to Dr Hadley, for the formula to work, the circle of rice bedded on the plate needs to be 61 per cent wider than the spherical cap of curry sat on top.

That way the formula, which was commissioned by Tilda rice, can be applied to any size meal.

For example, using a 27cm plate size, the perfect meal requires a 23cm diameter bed of rice just 5mm thick.

This supports a low dome of curry which is 14cm in diameter and is 2.4cm high at the tallest point.

Dr Hadley said, with a recommended portion size of 100g of cooked rice per person, the perfect meal requires 200g of curry to balance it visually. The plate should also contain 100g of meat or vegetables

Dr Hadley, who spent 40 hours devising the formula, said: 'We assume that, with a 27cm standard dinner plate, we want a 2cm clear band of clean plate around the outside of the rice.

'This is for aesthetic purposes and to allow room on the plate for "breakage" of the circle of rice when eating.'

With a recommended portion size of 100g of cooked rice per person, or 60g uncooked, the perfect meal requires 200g of curry to balance it visually. The plate should also contain 100g of meat or vegetables.

'The fluffiness of the rice is key to the formula as, with the separate grains, there is as much air as rice when laid out on the plate,' Dr Hadley said.

'This affects the look of the rice and how it feels in the mouth. This changes the effective density of the rice and results in equal volumes of rice and curry having different weights,' he added.

Curry is one of Britainâ€™s most popular 
dishes and the nation eats an estimated 3.5 million curries a week, with
 and one in seven being tikka masalas.

Anna Beheshi, senior brand manager at Tilda rice, said: 'The perfect curry really is about balancing each of the elements to ensure the best culinary experience possible.

'It is also important that the meal is visually appealing too, so the "hill" of curry sits perfectly on the wider base of rice.'
