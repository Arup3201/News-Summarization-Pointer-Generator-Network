A British soldier was left partially paralysed after a corporal put a gun in his mouth and shot him through the head 'as a joke'.

Kingsman Dean Hughes almost died when his section commander Corporal Bird fired from point-blank range during a mock argument in Afghanistan.

The corporal did not realise the 9mm pistol was loaded, according to The Sun.

Kingsman Hughes was extremely lucky to survive, but has lost the use of his right arm.

After being questioned by the newspaper, the MoD admitted last night that Corporal Bird had been court-martialled and locked up for 15 months for 'negligently performing a duty'.

The Kingsman is said to have had extensive physio at forces' rehab centre Headley Court in Surrey, but bears a scar in the back of his head where the bullet passed through.

A source told The Sun: 'The Army dealt with this in-house. This is not what Top Brass want people to hear about.

'Everyone was shocked when they found out the lad had been shot in the head by his own section commander.'

Bird will be dismissed from the Army when his jail sentence is over.

Both soldiers were with 2nd Battalion The Duke of Lancaster's Regiment at the time of the incident in February 2010.
