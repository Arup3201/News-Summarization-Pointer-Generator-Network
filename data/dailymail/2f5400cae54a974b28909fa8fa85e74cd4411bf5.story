Federal case: Jason Turk, 37, a real estate agent from Florida, has filed a lawsuit accusing Tampa police of violating his constitutional rights during a January incident when an officer shot him in the face as he sat in his car contemplating suicide

A Florida real estate agent and Navy veteran who was shot in the face earlier this year after his wife called 911 to report that he was suicidal has filed a federal lawsuit against Tampa and the responding officer.

Jason Turk, 37, and his wife, Amanda, claimed that the city failed to properly train Tampa police officers in crisis intervention.

The lawsuit filed Tuesday also alleges that K-9 officer Tim Bergman used excessive force when he fired twice on Turk as he was sitting in his BMW outside him home in January with a gun in his hand.

At around 4am on January 9, Amanda Turk dialled 911 to report that her severely depressed husband was possibly suicidal.

Mrs Turk told the emergency operator that Jason didn't have the nerve to pull the trigger himself, but was aware that if police arrive and he refused to put his gun down, they will shoot him.

The police department classified the call as 'suicide by cop.' According to the federal lawsuit filed by the Turks claiming violation of Jason’s Fourth Amendment rights, Amanda never mentioned that her husband wanted an officer to kill him.

News10 reported that of the 19 officers who responded to the scene on Peninsular Street that night, none received training on how to deal with people suffering from mental illness.

After the responding officers attempted to remove Turk from his car, the man allegedly waved his gun at them – a claim that Jason has disputed.

That is when K-9 officer Tim Bergman fired two shots, striking Turk in the face.

Jason Turk was rushed to St Joseph's Hospital where he had to undergo surgery. 

During an investigation into the shooting, officer Bergman said that Turk raised his gun, but the 11-year U.S. Navy veteran insisted that he kept his weapon down.

The couple's attorney, Michael Maddux, said the shooting was unjustified.

Jason Turk, who has a young daughter, 
said that if he posed a threat to anyone that night, it was to himself 
alone, and that what he needed was a trained crisis intervention officer
 who could de-escalate the situation instead of shooting him in the 
face.

The shooting was ruled justified by the Hillsborough County State Attorney, Bay News 9 reported.

The lawsuit states that Turk and his wife hit a rough patch in their marriage back in 2013. That year, Jason was also struck by a car while out biking.

The man had been suffering from severe depression, which resulted in Turk being committed two months before the January 9 suicide attempt, according to The Tampa Tribune.

On the night of the incident, Turk videotaped himself reading aloud his suicide note and sent it to his then-estranged wife, who called 911.

After the shooting, Turk took a selfie of his disfigured face and sent it to Amanda with the caption: 'It’s over!’

‘Skilled intervention, not force, was the order of the day for a successful, constitutional conclusion,’ the couple’s federal lawsuit stated.
