It is usually Nessie who is making shockwaves around Loch Ness, but an earthquake struck the area at the weekend - which was felt over 15 miles away.

The epicentre of the 2.4 magnitude tremor occurred about a mile south of Drumnadrochit at 8.49pm on Friday and at a depth of 2km.

The British Geological Survey said it was felt by residents over a wide area all along the loch and is the latest in a series of quakes to hit the Highlands recently.

The BGS said that as well as people in Drumnadrochit, the quake was felt by residents in Inverness, Dores, Westhill, Errogie, Brinmore, Farr, Scaniport, Culduthel, Torness and Inverfarigaig.

Some people described hearing a 'roaring sound; and the ground shaking.

'I felt the ground tremble and a roar like thunder,' said one woman from Inverness.

'It must have lasted a few seconds. Who knows - it might have been Nessie waking us up.'

Situated at the head of Urquhart Bay on the northern shore of Loch Ness, Drumnadrochit is the home of the Loch Ness Monster mystery.

The village is the home to the Loch Ness Centre, Nessieland Castle Monster Centre monster-spotting cruises, and nearby Urquhart Castle, beneath which is said to be the legendary underwater lair of Nessie.

The quake came a day after the photograph hailed as 'the best ever taken of the Loch Ness monster' was revealed to be an elaborate hoax by its creator.

Cruise boat captain George Edwards said he has no regrets over his 'bit of fun' which fooled 'Nessie' experts. But critics have attacked his admission.

The picture even fooled expert Steve Feltham, who has spent the last two decades hunting for Nessie.

But now he says Mr Edwards is 'nothing more than a faker and a liar.'

The famous 'Surgeon's Photograph' taken by Dr Robert Kenneth Wilson and published in 1934, which supposedly shows the monster's head and neck, also later proved to be a hoax.

A million people visit the loch each year, creating Â£25million for the economy.

There are roughly 200-300 quakes in Britain every year, but the vast majority are so small that no one notices them.

However between 20-30 are over 2.0 magnitude which can be felt over a wider area.

The largest known Scottish earthquake on land occurred near Loch Awe in 1880, with a magnitude of 5.2.

UK earthquakes, particularly in Scotland, are most often attributed to glacial rebound. Until about 10,500 years ago much of the north of the UK was covered by a thick layer of ice - which pushed the rocks down into the underlying mantle.

These rocks have been slowly rising back up ever since the ice melted, causing occasional earthquakes in the process.
