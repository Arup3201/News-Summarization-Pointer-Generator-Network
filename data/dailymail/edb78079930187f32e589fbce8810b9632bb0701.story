Cabinet minister Iain Duncan Smith today accused the BBC of launching a ‘politically-motivated’ attack on government plans to cap benefits at £26,000.

In an extraordinary on-air blast, the Work and Pensions Secretary accused the Corporation of using ‘lots of little cases’ to claim that limiting welfare payments would not get people back to work.

The confrontation live on Radio 4’s Today programme marks a significant escalation in the political row between Mr Duncan Smith and the BBC over reforms to the benefits system.

From today the maximum amount of benefits a family can claim will be capped at £26,000 a year – a figure equal to a pre-tax salary of more than £34,000.

A poll today reveals that almost three-quarters of the public back the cap, with two-thirds saying it will help get people on benefits back into work.

Mr Duncan Smith was grilled by BBC presenter John Humphrys, after the Today programme aired an interview with one benefits claimant who said she did not want to leave her home in London to find work.

As the debate heated up, Mr Duncan Smith insisted many working people who commute long distances every day.

He added: ‘The reality is there are plenty of families out there working and paying their taxes who will be asking this question: “Why are we arguing about this, why having a debate as to whether or not somebody should be earning more than they are on welfare payments not working?”’

Mr Humphrys intervened to argue: ‘But that’s not the point I am putting to you.’

Mr Duncan Smith then tore into the BBC’s attempts to undermine his reforms. He hit back: ‘No, cos what you are doing as always happens in the BBC is seeking out lots of little cases from people who are politically motivated to say this is wrong.’

Mr Humphrys said: ‘There are facts and beliefs and you can believe whatever you like.’

The minister responded: ‘The facts we have got, the fact is that people will not be earning more than average earnings sitting out of work unless they are in the exempt categories.

‘The way to resolve that is to go back to work, to earn your money so that as a result of that you no longer are capped. This is the incentive to take the right choices, it’s fair to taxpayers.’

Incentive: People told their benefits will be capped are already making renewed efforts to find work, Mr Duncan Smith insisted

Under the benefits cap, couples and 
lone parents will not receive more than £500 a week under the new cap, 
with single people limited to £350 a week.

The
 coalition argues it is fair on people who do work and pay taxes that 
those on state-funded benefits do not receive more than the average 
working family.

An Ipsos 
Mori poll commissioned by the Department for Work and Pensions found 
that just 11 per cent of the public think the benefits system is working
 effectively.

Some 59 per 
cent said they wanted politicians to do more to cut Britain’s welfare 
bill. A total of 74 per cent said they supported the benefits cap.

However,
 during today’s radio clash Mr Humphrys insisted: ‘We are arguing 
because it isn’t working. Nobody argues with the principle, that people 
who are capable of working, they should work.

‘The
 question is whether your scheme is going to do what it sets out to do, 
and the evidence such as it is - admittedly little so far - seems to 
suggest it doesn’t work.’

David Cameron blundered on Twitter today when he confused a Cabinet minister with a spoof Twitter account.

The Prime Minister, who once warned 'too many tweets might make a tw*t', wrote: We're rolling out a cap on Benefits today - @IDS_MP and I are determined to make work pay.'

But @IDS_MP is not Work and Pensions Secretary Iain Duncan Smith but a parody Twitter account based on the minister.

The clues should have been there. The account biography includes 'parodia' and the phrase 'chin chin old bean'.

The most recent tweet reads: 'I've always supported a Mansion Tax. Your Tax buys my Mansion. Chin chin!'

This morning the account reacted to the Prime Minister's gaffe: 'Chin chin Dave. Round mine for a Pimms later?'

Mr Duncan Smith, who repeatedly interrupted to insist his reforms are working, responded: ‘I believe we are right.

‘That what we are seeing, and this is the view of lots of people working in Jobcentres.

‘That they are getting people who were notified of the cap, their belief – this is advisers, they talk to me., I have been out on the ground, I have seen it myself, I talk to people actually in the Jobcentres – our belief generally is that they are going to seek work where they might not have sought work.’

Relations between the senior Tory and the BBC deteriorated in April after he was ambushed on air over whether he was challenged over whether he could live on £53-a-week by market trader David Bennett.But questions were later raised about the true level of Mr Bennett's income.

Mr Duncan Smith has also heavily criticised the BBC's use of the phrase 'bedroom tax' to describe changes to housing benefit.

The government says it is ending the 'spare room subsidy' for people receiving taxpayer support for rooms they do not need.

But the Corporation took to using Labour's 'bedroom tax' slogan, which Mr Duncan Smith said was a 'disgrace'.

However, charities criticised the introduction of the benefits cap. Matthew Reed, chief executive of the Children's Society, accused the Government of trying to use a 'blunt instrument' to solve a complex problem.

He added: 'The debate around this cap has focused solely on workless adults, but the reality is that children are seven times more likely than adults to lose out.

'140,000 children, compared to 60,000 adults, will pay the price as parents have less to spend on food, clothing and rent.

'We fully support efforts to make work pay. But it is not right to do this by putting more children on the breadline. Instead, the Government should do more to help families by tackling the sky high rents in some parts of the UK and making childcare affordable.'
