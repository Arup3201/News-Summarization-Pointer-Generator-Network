Jailed: Martin Counsell's home-made IED bombs and detonators were found in two garages he rented in Cheltenham, Gloucestershire

A 'crank' who triggered a terrorist alert when he made explosives to scare off burglars has been jailed today.

Six hundred people had to be evacuated when Martin Counsell’s homemade IED bombs and detonators were found in two garages he rented in Cheltenham, Gloucestershire.

Counsell, 52, had alarmed neighbours by uploading a video showing an explosion in a residential 
street, in the film is seen describing it as his 'application for joining Al Qaeda'.

The Electrical engineer had told Gloucester Crown Court  the explosives were the cheapest way he could find
 of making burglar deterrents at a time when he was £10,000 in debt and 
could not afford an alarm.

His IEDs were discovered because he had tried to make himself a fake MI6 identity card and he was interrogated for six days by anti-terrorist police after
 his arrest.

He had created the mini bombs with TATP (tri-acetone tri-peroxide), the same substance that was used in the London Tube bombings of July 7 2005, said prosecutor Lisa Hennessy.

Jailing Counsell, who once ran his own burglar alarm company, Judge Jamie Tabor QC told him he was satisfied he had no connection with terrorism or political organisations.

The judge said he also accepted that Counsell, an alcoholic with cirrhosis of the liver, was lonely and depressed after his wife left him and his business collapsed in 2010.

'As you became more isolated from society you became what the Victorians described as a crank. You had an obsessive fear of burglars,' said the judge.

'I am quite satisfied you gave a truthful account when you said you created these explosives to deter burglars.

'I am also satisfied you created them with the intention of scaring rather than injuring. '

The judge said he also believed Counsell’s explanation for trying to make himself an MI6 card - that he thought it would help him get treatment from a psychotherapist more quickly.

'But these were small quantities of volatile, sensitive and very dangerous material,' he said.

However, Judge Tabor said he did not accept 
Counsell’s claim that the explosives were the cheapest way he could find
 of making burglar deterrents.

He said: 'You
 chose to make explosives because you were bored and you were fascinated
 by the whole process and I suspect regarded it as something of a 
challenge.

'Your actions particularly in the present climate disturbed and frightened residents.

'Your
 actions undermined their confidence causing them in some cases to be 
really frightened and anxious and some remain so even to this day, as 
witnessed by the fact that 200 people attended a public meeting arranged
 by the police. That gives you some idea of the scale of fear you 
caused.

'The thought of you, an alcoholic, working in your grubby garage creating dangerous explosives is very disturbing indeed.'

Counsell had pleaded guilty to a charge that between September 1, 2011 and May 12, 2012 he had made TATP 'in circumstances to give rise to suspicion that he was not making it for a lawful object.'

Mrs Hennessy had told the court 'When 
Gloucestershire constabulary received a tip off from the Metropolitan 
Police that a man in Gloucestershire was seeking to create a fake 
identity card for MI6 they had little idea what they were to find.

'The man in question, Mr Counsell, had been buying various items on eBay that indicated he might be making explosive devices.

'Not only that, but he was definitely not an MI6 employee.

When police searched Counsell's house on May 11 this year they found various items including a quantity of detonators.

Mrs Henessy added: 'His internet 
browsing history showed numerous searches dating from August 2011 on how
 to make small bombs and and where to buy the ingredients.

'The police also discovered he had access to two garages in Buttermere close in Cheltenham.

'In
 the first to be searched were four fully functional imporoved explosive
 devices which were tested in controlled explosions and which exploded 
with no difficulty.

'The 
debris contained a substance called TATP which Counsell had mananged to 
manufacture. This is a very sensitive high explosive which can be 
detonated by static, spark, flame, impact or friction. It is not used 
commercially because its storage qualities are poor and it is too 
sensitive for safe use.

'It is worth noting that this compound was used in the London tube bombings on 7 July 2005.

'Also at the garage was a selection of chemicals and various detonators , presumably for use in making further IEDs.

'There was also what appeared to be a home made rocket launcher but which Mr Couonsell described as a potato gun.'

Another detonator was found in the other garage nearby, she said.

Counsell was interviewed for several 
days by Counter Terrorist officers at Willenhall police syation and told
 them he had made about ten of the devices and had tested five of them 
in his back garden, said Mrs Hennessy.

'He said he had done this in order to 
create booby traps for burglars after being frightened that someone had 
got into his house when his dogs started barking in the night.

'The
 police have no record of any report of bugrlary at his address. There 
was also no security at the house - as Mr Counsell himself put it, the 
back door was totally insecure, the house had no insurance because he 
could not afford to pay for it and the front door was also inadequately 
secured. A fence panel in the back garden was also missing.

'There
 was an alarm box on the house but it was not connected even though 
Counsell had previously had his own alarm company. He said it was 
because he had not got around to it because he was so depressed.'

He
 insisted that none of the devices would have caused injury - just a 
loud bang which would have been enough to frighten any burglar away.'

Counsell also told police that he wanted the MI6 card to help him get an appointment with a psychothersapist. And he said his alcoholic cirrhosis meant he had only a couple of years to live.

The area around the garages had to be evacuated in a radius of 200 metres and six hundred people, including residents of a care home, had to get out of their homes, she added.

The incident had caused such great concern that police held a public meeting to explain the situation to residents.

'There has been heightened tension between the local communities and efforts are continuing to bring this back to normal levels,' added Mrs Hennessy.

She said the devices could cause the loss of one or more fingers if they went off in someone’s hand.

They would cause superficial injujries if they exploded very close to a person.

Lloyd Jenkins, defending, pointed out that Counsell is a man of previous good character but now ‘lonely after a catalogue of personal problems.’

The six days of intense interrogation he had received as a suspected terrorist had ‘turned his world upside down,’ Mr Jenkins said.
