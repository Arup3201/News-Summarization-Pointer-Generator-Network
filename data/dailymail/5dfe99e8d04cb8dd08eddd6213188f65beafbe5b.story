It's not every day you spot two elephants meeting on a street corner, but this impressive topiary is not just turning heads.

Creator
 Tim Bushe, 60, charges for his hedge art to fundraise for the Hft 
charity that supports his sister Martha, who has Down’s Syndrome.

Appropriately-named
 Mr Bushe who lives in Highbury, north London, first discovered his 
talent for privet-hedge trimming four years ago when his wife Philippa 
asked him to trim the front garden bushes into the shape of a cat.

The
 60-year-old architect didn’t have time for a cat, but used his electric
 42-inch Black & Decker hedge cutter to create a steam engine 
instead.

Hehas since gone on to create several topiary works of art 
including those in the shapes of serpents, knots, owls, a chicken, a 
cannon and a Chinese dragon.

Mr
 Bushe said he enjoys clipping sculptural hedges because they form new 
links in the community and create closer relationships with his 
neighbours.  

He also 
creates the hedge-art to raise money for the charity Hft that supports 
his youngest sister, Martha, who has Down’s syndrome, and charges £250 
for a hedge-sculpture and £75 for each of the next three shapes.
