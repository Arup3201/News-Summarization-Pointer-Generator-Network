Liverpool's current crop of strikers may be disappointing their team-mates, but the same can't be said of loan star Divock Origi.

After sending the youngster on a season-long loan to Lille, Liverpool will be keeping a close eye on the striker as his side take on Everton in the Europa League on Thursday night, and team-mate Simon Kjaer is one of his many admirers.

'He could be a truly great player for Liverpool,' the Danish defender told MirrorSport. 

Belgium international Divock Origi signed for Brendan Rodgers' men in June after an impressive World Cup 

Brendan Rodgers swooped for the 19-year-old after he starred for Belgium last summer but agreed to immediately send him back to Lille on a season-long loan to aid his development

'He has got great potential and could become on of the best players in his position.

'Origi is one of the greatest talents I have ever played with in Italy, Germany or France. I have no doubt about his potential.

'He's still very young and it was a clever move to let him mature one more season with Lille, but he's got the complete package - physically, technically and great speed.

Lille team-mate Simon Kjaer said that Origi was extremely versatile and already possessed great technique

'A special thing about him is that he has no real weak spots, which he needs to work on. Instead he can just work on the things he's already good at. That's a huge advantage.

'He's actually pretty versatile. We can use him on both sides and up front as well. Now I have played with Origi for a year and he really seems to have a good mentality. He is a dedicated pro at his young age.'

Lille are known as the clean-sheet kings in France and will be aiming to frustrate Everton again after shutting them out a fortnight ago.

Kjaer, 25, is their defensive linchpin and says he is relishing going up against Romelu Lukaku and Samuel Eto'o again after his success in their first meeting.

The Danish defender said the young striker was one of the best talents he had ever played with

Mario Balotelli has underperformed since joining the club and some fans believe Origi should be recalled

'With Lille, we are still unbeaten in the Europa League, and with another clean sheet, which is our speciality, and maybe even a win, we would still very much be in the race to advance in this tournament,' said Kjaer.

'I always enjoy playing against top class players like Eto'o, who I know quite well from games in the Serie A and with the Denmark national team, and Lukaku, who has a lot of quality.

'He is the same type of big, strong forward that I meet almost every week in France.
