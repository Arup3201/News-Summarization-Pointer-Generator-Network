A British teenager was seen being chased just before falling from the ninth floor of a hotel in Spain, it emerged today.

Police in the resort of Magaluf, have closed the file into the death 10 days ago of Tom Ousby, 19, but now his family want a full inquiry because they suspect 'foul play'.

Toxicology tests found no drugs and barely any alcohol in his body and mystery surrounds what he was doing at the hotel and why he was found without shoes, wallet or phone.

An aspiring model and musician Tom Ousby, 19, of Uxbridge, north-west London, had told friends he was promoting bars and boat trips at the Spanish party resort

Tom, an aspiring model and musician from Uxbridge, west London, 
was said to have ignored a warning from a maintenance man who told him 
to get down from the outside fire escape of the four-star hotel.

He then slipped and fell more than 60ft, landing on a wall. Staff said they had seen him running away from someone shortly before the tragedy.

His father John, 49, said: 'If there was foul play we want to know about it. We owe it to Tom. Whether he was chased is crucial to knowing what happened.

'If something happened and made him panic and try to get away - could someone have potentially met Tom  at the top of the roof or the stairs.?'

Death: Tom Ousby is believed to have died on Thursday after falling from the ninth floor of a four-star hotel in Magaluf, Majorca

Tom had been working at the Majorcan resort for  three months, promoting 
bars and boat trips at the party resort.

On the day of his death he had left his apartment  at 6.15am and gone to the Atlantic Park  hotel about a mile away.

A receptionist told investigating officers she had seen Tom being chased. The fire escape from which her son fell was reported to be inaccessible.

Police could not identify him until friends in Majorca reported him missing.

His mother Lea told the Sunday 
Mirror: 'We want to know why he was at the hotel and what happened with 
the chase. The CCTV can hopefully give us answers.

'He wouldn't have gone there without a reason so I need to know what that is to give myself peace of mind.'

His family are facing a bill of around £10,000 to fly his body home because he didn't have any insurance.

Fall: A spokesman for the Atlantic Park hotel in Magaluf, where the incident is reported to have happened, refused to comment

Mr and Mrs Ousby, of Denham, Bucks,  are planning to hire a lawyer to press the Spanish authorities for a full inquiry. They only learned of their son's death when 'RIP Tom' messages appeared online.

The tragedy happened just days before Tom, who modelled for Marks and Spencer as a child, was due to fly home.

He had tweeted in June: ‘Crazy times, haha! It’s all good, selling 
tickets for bar crawls and boat parties.’

Hours before his death he told friends on Twitter: ‘Magas all good, coming home sometime this week though.’ Tributes were 
left on the website, including a picture of his name spelt out in 
tea-light candles.

'I truly adore him and cannot understand why he's not here'

Danielle McCabe, friend

Danielle McCabe tweeted: ‘Thomas William Ousby has the most amazing energy I’ve ever met in a person.

‘I truly adore him and cannot understand why he’s not here.’

Another friend, Chelsie Louise,  
tweeted: ‘Delighted I got the privilege to meet such an outstanding 
genuinely happy guy and call him a friend.’

A YouTube video of Tom Ousby playing drums to Taylor Swift’s song 22 has been watched more than 9,000 times.

The Atlantic Park hotel in Magaluf, where the incident is reported to have happened, declined to comment.

The teenager is the fifth Briton to die in a hotel fall in little over a year.
