Amazing new pictures have been released which capture the stories behind the far-flung resting places of Commonwealth soldiers who died during the First World War.

The images, which feature in a new photographic book, show war graves and memorials from around the world in what is being billed as photographic tribute to the unsung heroes of the Great War.

It also honours the work of the Commonwealth War Graves Commission (CWGC), which maintains graves at more than 23,000 locations across the world.

The Anzac beach cemetery in Gallipoli, Turkey, which also features in the new book. The cemetery has 391 casualties buried there, mainly from the United Kingdom, Australia and New Zealand. The eight month campaign in Gallipoli was fought by Commonwealth and French forces in an attempt to force Turkey out of the war in April 1915. The cemetery was created on the first day of the Anzac landings until the evacuation. There are 369 identified casualties buried there, as well as 33, who have never been identified.

The Trekkopje Cemetery in Nambia, where nine Commonwealth soldiers are buried. The cemetery, one of the smallest war grave cemeteries in the world, is situated on railway property adjacent to the now abandoned Trekkopje station in the African country. The nine casualties buried at the cemetery were victims of an attack by German forces on South African railway protection troops on April 26, 1915. The youngest man to die in the attack was 19-year-old William Ernest Anderson, while the oldest was George Stirrit Reid, aged 63. 

The Guisancourt farm cemetery in France, where 150 Commonwealth soldiers from the First World War are buried. The cemetery was made shortly after the farm in northern France was captured in October 1918 with mainly British casualties buried there. The farm, near the town of Gouy, was secured by the 11th Sherwood Foresters and the 1st/6th Royal Warwicks (25th Division). Of the casualties buried here, 15 are unidentified with all but one falling in October, 1918.

The Beaumont-Hamel Memorial Park in the Somme, pictured, in northern France. The town of Beaumont-Hamel was reached in July 1916, but could not be held. It took until November of that year before the town could be secured. The cemetery is the burial site of British casualties, including some whose remains were taken to the site after the Armistice in November 1918. A total of 179 soldiers are buried at the cemetery, with 82 of those buried there still unidentified 

In the book, photo journalist Michael St Maur Sheil visited hundreds of sites to bring to life the stories behind them - from a soldier buried alongside his twin, who died the same day, in Saskatchewan in Canada to the memorial by the Tower of London dedicated to 12,000 men lost at sea.

Accompanied by a commentary from Peter Francis, from the CWGC, the photos are hoped to give an insight into the sheer number and spread of war graves and the commission’s work in maintaining them.

United Kingdom - 781, 858 

Canada - 60, 260 

Australia - 59, 508

India - 52, 229

New Zealand - 16, 693

South Africa - 8,940

From headstones in the remote Namib Desert to those in the undergrowth of Buff Bay in Jamaica,and from an isolated grave on a tiny island on Loch Shiel to the 72,000 names on the Thiepval Memorial in France, the book aims to commemorate some of history’s greatest and most devastating battles and the men and women who fought and died in them.

Mr Sheil said he wanted to 'make each picture count'.

He explained: 'I did not want the book to be just a collection of stones and crosses but rather wanted to show the cemeteries within the landscape.

'The CWGC works in an amazing range of climatic and geographical regions so I wanted show that extent and show the landscapes where these men died.

'They were all equal places of death and my job was really to reflect the extent of CWGC work in caring for these graves wherever they may be.

'The handful of men buried at Trekkopje in the Namib desert are just as ‘dead’ and were just as missed by their families as the mass of men in Tyne Cot.'

He said the most memorable spot for him was the grave of Donald Pollack, who is buried alongside his twin brother in the remote hills of Saskatchewan.

The Osmandwall cemetery in Orkney, off the coast of Scotland, pictured, is the burial site of Royal British Navy members, who died during the early part of the First World War. It was used by the Navy from the outbreak of war in 1914, until 1915 before the creation of Lyness Cemetery elsewhere on Orkney. There are 42 casualties buried there, many of them in the eastern part of the site in a plot marked by a war cross

The St Finnan's Isle Burial Ground is a tiny island in Loch Shiel, near Fort William known locally as the 'Green Isle'. It is surrounded by a ruined chapel and ancient burial sites. There are only two graves, one of which is that of a D. Grant who lived in the tiny hamlet of Dalelia, across the loch from the island and who died in 1916. The other is of Mary MacDonald, a 23-year-old, who died during the Second World War

The burial site is on an island in the middle of Loch Shiel, close to Fort William in Inverness-shire. The cemetery is privately owned and is only accessible by boat.  Author of the new book Michael St Maur Sheil said he wanted to make Mr Sheil 'each picture count' and aims to tell the story behind the cemeteries and about the soldiers and people who are buried there 

The Gretna Memorial in Edinburgh's Rosebank Cemetery contains 270 First World War burials. Most died in the Gretna railway disaster, when two trains collided at Quintinshill Junction near Gretna on May 22, 1915, killing 210 officers and men of the 1st/7th Royal Scots on their way to embark for Gallipoli. Victims of the disaster are buried in the Memorial Ground. During the war, the port of Leith in Edinburgh was used by hospital ships from north Russia and about 4,500 officers and men passed through it

More than 180 men who fell during the First World War are buried at Queensferry Cemetery in West Lothian, pictured, with almost all of them serving in the Royal Navy. The headstone was erected by the people of South Queensferry in memory of those died during the Battle of Jutland, a naval battle during 1916, where the British defeated the German forces 

'It is a lovely tranquil spot though the farmstead has long been abandoned. One can only imagine the happy scene as he returned from the war to be greeted by his family and especially his twin brother, Alexander', explained Mr Sheil.

'And one can only imagine the horror and misery for his mother as he fell sick with influenza and infected his brother: how terrible it must have been for her to watch her two sons, born on the same day, dying on the same day.

'The Spanish flu was a vicious killer where you literally drowned in your own bodily fluids and to have this happen in such a remote place, so far from help after the joy of home-coming is such a cruel irony.'

The book, For The Fallen by photojournalist Michael St MaurSheil, who visited hundreds of Commonwealth War Graves sites to bring to life the stories behind them

Mr Sheil, who has been documenting battlefields of the Great War since 2006, said he hoped the book would help people realise that the First World War was fought far beyond Europe.

He added: 'I would like people to realise that the First World War was exactly that, namely a World War: we tend to think of it just being in France but we ignore its territorial range and the collateral loss of life.

'The loss of life in Africa is estimated to have been over one million people largely through famine and disease and it helped generate the terrible pandemic of Spanish flu.

'I think that cemeteries tend to ‘bend’ history in that it is easy to research and tell the stories of the men in the cemeteries whereas it is often impossible to tell the story of those who survived and never again spoke of their experiences so those who vied are often forgotten about.'
