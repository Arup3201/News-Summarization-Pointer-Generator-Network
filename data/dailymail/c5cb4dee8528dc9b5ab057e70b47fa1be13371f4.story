Liverpool's summer spending will reach £100million when they sign Dejan Lovren, Divock Origi and Loic Remy in the next 24 hours.

Lovren underwent a medical yesterday after Liverpool agreed a £20million deal with Southampton to make him the most expensive defender in the club’s history. Lovren will fly out to the USA to join up with his new team-mates once his medical is approved.

An announcement is expected on the £10million signing of Origi on Sunday , but he is expected to return to Lille on loan.

Remy, meanwhile, has been waiting to start his Liverpool career after an £8.5million offer was accepted by QPR last weekend.
