Lenient sentences are fuelling the cannabis trade which is now more serious than dealers of Class A drugs, a senior police officer has warned.

Andy Wards, assistant chief constable for Merseyside police, revealed there had been an ‘explosion’ in production of cannabis causing serious problems for officers.

Gangs were exploiting the cannabis market believing they are less likely to be caught and if they are they will receive softer sentences.

The the last three years police in the North West have uncovered more than 5,000 cannabis factories

Anyone caught dealing Class B drugs, including cannabis, face a maximum prison sentence of up to 14 years or an unlimited fine, compared to life in prison for dealing class A drugs such as cocaine or ecstasy.

Mr Ward said: ‘There has been an 
explosion in the market for cannabis. Unlike class A drugs, which the 
criminals can’t make themselves, there is the opportunity to grow 
cannabis in the bathrooms or bedrooms of houses.

‘They can make a lot of money very quickly at less risk [to themselves] and less risk in terms of sentencing.’

Assistant chief constable Andy Ward of Merseyside police said the cannabis trade is now worse than that for Class A drugs

Shootings were increasingly linked to cannabis deals, he added, as he appealed for courts to hand out tougher punishments.

‘Criminals who have previously been involved in something else are drifting into the cannabis world. The amount of money being made by criminals should be reflected in the sentencing.’

More than 5,000 cannabis factories 
have been uncovered by police in the North West in the last three years,
 containing 350,000 plants, The Daily Telegraph reported.

Mr Ward chairs the North West 
Regional Organised Crime Unit and is also head of Merseyside’s Matrix 
Unit, which was set up to combat drug and gun crime.

He
 added: ‘A lot of these shootings are linked to activity around 
cannabis. We are seeing big increases in cannabis production on 
Merseyside. Individual groups are fighting turf wars. 

‘We have huge issues around cannabis.’

Lee Donafee, the network director for the Merseyside Inclusion Network, works with young people to deter them from a life of crime.

‘The kids say it's easy money to go round selling drugs,’ he said.

‘We make them aware of what can happen if they follow the wrong path."
