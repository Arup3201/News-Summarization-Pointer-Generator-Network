A schoolgirl fraudster aged just 12 scammed money out of members of the public by pretending she was collecting money in aid of a cancer charity.

The child was reported to police after she approached Elaine Walton and asked her to donate.

Mrs Walton gave the girl £5 after seeing her in Brighouse, West Yorkshire, but was was suspicious so checked up on her by telephoning the school she claimed to be from.

Collection: Elaine Walton was approached by a schoolgirl in Brighouse, West Yorkshire, and asked to donate money to a cancer charity

However, Bradford Grammar School confirmed that the girl was not a pupil, and the school was not raising money for cancer research.

Mrs Walton reported her to the police - 
who have confirmed that the girl was dealt with by a 'community 
resolution' following the incident on March 18, and will have to pay back the money.

'I was approached by a young white girl aged around 10 or 11,' said Mrs Walton.

'She had a school uniform on and said she was asking for sponsors for Cancer Trust. She had lots of names on the form.

'It would have been my husband's 54th birthday and he was on my mind as he died from cancer in August last year and because my heart is close to this charity I signed the form and gave the girl £5 which she put in a plastic bag to take back to school.

'When I got back to my office I rang Bradford Grammar School - the girl said she was from there. They had never heard of this girl and she certainly was not at their school and the school was not collecting for Cancer Trust. I don't think was the only person tricked by this young girl.'

Checks: Mrs Walton became suspicious so called Bradford Grammar School, where the girl said she was a pupil. However, the school had no record of her

Police inquiries were made and they managed to track down the girl and cautioned her.

Inspector David Shaw, of the Lower Valley Neighbourhood Policing Team, said:'We received one call shortly after 8.30am on Tuesday, March 18, reporting concerns about a girl collecting money in Brighouse town centre.

'The girl said she was collecting money for a cancer charity and gave details of her name and school she attended. The caller handed money over and signed a form but on making further inquiries found there was no girl of the name given registered at that school. A search was made of the area but the girl was not located.

'Following further inquiries by officers from the Neighbourhood Policing Team, the girl involved was identified and has been issued with a community resolution.

'The 12-year-old will also be paying back the money taken.'
