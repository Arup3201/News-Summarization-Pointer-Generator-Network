Soaring spring temperatures could bring swarms of the huge jellyfish to British shores, experts are warning.

A one-metre wide barrel jellyfish which washed up in Portland, Dorset this week is thought to be one of the first in an influx of the creatures heading to UK waters.

The warmer than average weather expected in coming months means beach-goers may see jellyfish much bigger than they are used to - some as big as dustbin lids.

The huge barrel jellyfish washed up in Portland, Dorset is said to be one of the first of an invasion of larger species of the creatures heading to Britain

This particular variety is said to be harmless but experts have warned beach-goers to watch out for other species

Experts are warning that some of the new jellyfish can sting and anyone affected should seek medical attention

Richard Harrington from the Marine Conservation Society (MCS) said: 'This predicted hot weather to come can mean that even more jellyfish are likely to wash up or be in the seas around places like the west Country.'

Commenting on the latest find, he added: 'Although this barrel jellyfish is harmless, the numbers of jellyfish are likely to grow fairly quickly as sea temperatures rise.

'We are very keen to hear from people that find any washed up anywhere around the country.

Dog walker Suzanne Sheldon, who discovered the creature, said it was the largest jellyfish she'd ever seen

Experts are warning anyone planning to head to the seaside later in the month to beware of the creatures

'The barrel jellyfish is an Atlantic species and are sometimes found washed up but still advise the public not to touch them.'

Portland resident Suzanne Sheldon, 48, found the large creature washed up on her local beach earlier this week and reported the find to the MCS.

She said: 'I came across this massive jellyfish as I took my dog for a walk on a quiet beach at Portland.

'It was at least three feet in width and was very bulky too. It was the largest jellyfish I have ever seen.'

Weather forecasters expect high pressure to take hold later in May, sending temperatures rising above 20C.
