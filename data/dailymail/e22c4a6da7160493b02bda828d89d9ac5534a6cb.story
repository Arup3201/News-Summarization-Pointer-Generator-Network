Man with a plan: Iain Duncan Smith arrives at Number 10 for a Cabinet meeting. A think tank said today his benefit reforms will work

Iain Duncan Smith’s plan to  persuade millions of people that working is more lucrative than living on benefits could succeed, Britain’s leading economic think tank said today.

Reforms will widen the gap between wages and the income of people living on handouts, the Institute for Fiscal Studies said.

It added in its report that tax increases, benefit cuts and Mr Duncan Smith’s Universal Credit system ‘will strengthen people’s incentives to work’.

A week ago the National Audit Office condemned Universal Credit as ‘badly managed and over ambitious’. But yesterday’s report vindicated the reforms.

The report said the complex changes will give the workless reason to seek a job and encourage those in jobs to work harder for promotions and pay rises.

Economists Stuart Adam and James Browne said tax increases and benefit cuts will swallow more than £33million a year from incomes by 2015, hitting those on benefits harder than workers.

Mr Adam said: ‘The Government’s welfare reforms strengthen financial incentives to be in work, on average, more than offsetting the weakening caused by falling real wages.’

However, he cautioned that ‘there is a huge amount of variation in these effects, with large numbers of people seeing big rises or big falls in effective tax rates.

‘Changes in non-financial work incentives and in the perception of how the tax and benefit system works are also likely to be important, and are much harder to quantify. The overall effects of these changes on behaviour remains to be seen.’

The report said that Chancellor George Osborne’s changes to personal taxation will mean that taxpayers will have to hand over an extra £11 billion a year to the Treasury.

Cuts in benefits - including tax credit restrictions, cuts in Child Benefit, and the ‘bedroom tax’ reduction in Housing Benefit for those in bigger homes - will amount to £22 billion, it found.

The third major influence will be Universal Credit, already in operation in test areas, which will cost the Treasury roughly the same as the present cost of the six different benefits it is to replace.

The overall effect, the IFS said, will be to reduce the average replacement rate, the difference between someone’s income on benefits and their income in work, by 3.4 per cent.

Without the reform the figure would have gone up by 1.7 points, stripping income from people who work while making it more worthwhile to live on benefits.

Mr Duncan Smith’s Universal Credit will give incentives to workless couples to get one person into a job, will help one-earner families more than two earner-families, and will give 1.5 million people who currently have little incentive to work income gains if they get jobs.

The report said: ‘Benefit changes other than Universal Credit are responsible for the bulk of the strengthening of incentives to be in work.

‘But the effect is less dramatic than might be expected given the scale of the cuts. Incentives are strengthened much less for those with children than those without children.’

A spokesman for Mr Duncan Smith’s Department for Work and Pensions said: ‘We are pleased that the IFS find that our welfare reforms will support people into work.

‘Universal Credit will further increase work incentives, especially for those held back the most by the current system, and this will benefit families and the economy.’

David Cameron last night suggested the full roll-out of Universal Credit could be delayed from its 2017 deadline after the criticisms it received from the National Audit Office last week.
