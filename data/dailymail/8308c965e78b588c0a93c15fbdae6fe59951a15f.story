Three Bears investor George Taylor threw his weight behind plans for Rangers supporters to purchase a say in the running of the club on Sunday night.

Hong Kong-based Taylor has lined up with Douglas Park and George Letham in an alliance of businessman battling for control of the troubled Ibrox outfit.

American banker Robert Sarver has also launched a £20million takeover bid, with proposals for £6.5m of emergency funding included.

Sharing the interests of former director Dave King, who has also purchased 14.5 per cent of the club, Taylor is now the second biggest individual shareholder with 9.3 per cent and echoes the view of fellow investor Letham - a member of the Rangers Supporters Trust - that fans should run the club.

The Morgan Stanley managing director has now signed up a lifetime membership with fan ownership group Rangers First.

‘As I’ve said, my hope is that direct fan ownership would become the biggest individual owner of Rangers,’ said Taylor in a statement released on Sunday.

Taylor is the latest high-profile figure to encourage fan ownership after wealthy supporter Jim McColl gifted his 10,000 shares to Rangers First last week.

The group have witnessed a surge in membership, with 700 new members signing up since the Three Bears and King made their recent power push, acquiring an effective hold of around 34 per cent in the club.

Rangers First now own around 0.8 per cent, with another fan ownership scheme run by Rangers Supporters Trust holding just over one per cent.

A four-week radio recruitment campaign will be launched by Rangers First on Monday as they seek to raise cash to buy up more shares and hold talks with key stakeholders.

Their support could help the Three Bears and King edge closer to the 51 per cent they need to effectively seize control of the Rangers boardroom and push through change via an anticipated EGM.

Rangers First director Ricki Neill said: ‘With our monthly contributors donating amounts from £5 upwards, Rangers First have the income to buy an increasing number of shares every month.

‘The more members we get the faster we grow and the bigger our shareholding becomes.

‘We also have the Club 1872 membership which George Taylor has recently joined. This costs £500 and was designed originally to help us reach our target in as short a period as possible.

‘George Taylor is one of many true Rangers Fans that have joined Club 1872. We look forward to meeting up with George in the near future.’
