Fast food chain Red Rooster has been slammed by the Food Intolerance Network for making 'misleading and erroneous' advertising claims about their food being preservative and MSG free

Fast food chain Red Rooster has been slammed by a lobby group for making 'misleading and erroneous' advertising claims that its food is free of 'anything artificial'.

The Food Intolerance Network, made up of over 10,000 Australian and New Zealand families, has lodged a complaint against the fast food giant with the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC), claiming that Red Rooster's product range is filled with artificial additives and MSG despite the company's claims of the contrary.

Dr Howard Denagte, the co-founder of the network who has a doctrine in food technology, told Daily Mail Australia that by simply studying the nutritional information provided for each product on Red Rooster's website, he managed to identify over 12 items with MSG and seven synthetic antioxidants in various items.

These include artificial additives that were identified as of concern for children by the Commonwealth Department of Health. 

'Their advertisement clearly stated "you won't find anything artificial in any of the food made by us"; that is misleading,' Dr Dengate said.

He said that other false claims made by Red Rooster since September were '100 per cent Australian Canola Oil' and 'Our chicken nuggets… are preservative free'.

'Synthetic antioxidant 319 tert-Butylhydroquinone tBHQ is in the canola oil used to cook the Cheesy Nuggets and Nuggets. While this is not technically a preservative it is added to preserve the oil, and the oil is not '100 per cent' as claimed. The products contain ingredients that are artificial,' Dr Dengate's complaint states.

However he claims the company has since changed the wording on their website

'Preservative 220 sulphur dioxide is in the Guilt-free Tenders salad dressing. This additive requires a public warning on any ingredient label due to asthma concerns. Their website currently claims incorrectly that there is no sulphite present. This product contains this ingredient which is artificial.'

Red Rooster's national marketing manager, Anna Jones, told Daily Mail Australia that the company stood by their claims that 'there are no artificial colours, flavours or added MSG present in any meals we prepare.'

'This has been verified by Siliker, a global leader in food safety and quality, who acted as an independent auditor to ensure everything prepared by Red Rooster was free of artificial colours, flavours or added MSG,' Ms Jones said. 

However Dr Denagte claims Red Rooster has changed the wording in their advertisements - which stated 'there's no... MSG in the meals we prepare' - since the complaint was lodged with the ACCC, saying: 'basically, they essentially pleaded guilty'.

'In fact it's hard to find any food product they have there that doesn't contain MSG,' Dr Denagte said.

'By now they have changed it to say 'no added MSG'… but any food chemist asked to analyse these foods would find MSG despite the lawyer's trick.

'In fact it's hard to find any food product they have there that doesn't contain MSG,' Dr Denagte said

'It is our view that hydrolysed vegetable protein and yeast extract are artificial products in that protein is broken down, typically by boiling with hydrochloric acid, then neutralising the slurry with sodium hydroxide, resulting in high concentrations of the sodium cation and the glutamate anion. This is MSG by any chemical understanding.'

MSG can be found in Red Roosters roast chicken, chicken stuffing, chicken salt, gravy, chicken nuggets, combi salt, rosemary sprinkle, chip salt and most sauces, according to the Food Intolerance Network's complaint.

'I'd like them to stop making misleading and erroneous claims in their advertising and I'd like them ideally remove more artificial substance form the food they're selling,' Dr Dengate said. 

Daily Mail Australia have contacted Red Rooster for comment

Red Rooster has retaliated by arguing that they could accurately claim their meals were 'free of added MSG'. 

'We also note the comments today of Professor Peter Clifton, a nutrition expert at the University of South Australia, who confirmed we could accurately claim our meals are free of added MSG as glutamate, an amino acid, is found in all protein foods and our glutamate rises whenever we eat any protein,' Ms Jones said.

'With regard to the suggestions that our canola oil is not 100 per cent Australian and our chicken nuggets are not preservative free, after reconfirming with our certifiers and suppliers in the past 24 hours we again reject these comments as inaccurate.

'Red Rooster has no record of any contact or complaint from the Food Intolerance Network, however we would be happy to sit down with their members to provide clarity around the issues they have raised and to correct some unfounded claims.'
