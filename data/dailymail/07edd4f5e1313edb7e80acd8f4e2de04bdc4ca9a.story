They might be playgrounds to the rich and famous – but Dorset and Dubai are worlds apart.

That could all be about to change, however, after a millionaire property developer unveiled plans to bring a touch of the Middle East to the West Country.

The ambitious project would see the Sandbanks peninsula in Poole transformed into an ultra-modern holiday destination, not dissimilar to Dubai’s Palm developments.

Visionary: The proposals put forward by Mr Mitchell would feature restaurants, casinos, shops, apartments and a helicopter landing pad at Sandbanks in Dorset

Futuristic: How Sandbanks in Dorset could look in the future as proposed by resident and property tycoon Eddie Mitchell, 59

These man-made outcrops, shaped like palm trees, are home to luxurious hotels and multi-million-pound villas.

Sandbanks,
 the most expensive place to live in the UK outside London, already has 
its fair share of impressive beach-side properties.

But
 under the plans, it would gain a 33-storey ‘sports tower’ for 
abseiling, bungee jumping and rock climbing, a seven-star hotel shaped 
like a seagull, a larger marina, open-air swimming pool and theatre.

It
 would all be protected by arching sea defences which resemble the 
‘branches’ of the offshore palms in the United Arab Emirates.

Dorset's Sandbanks could look like this proposal dreamed up by resident and property developer Mr Mitchell, who wants to stop the area disappearing under sea level

The peninsula, which sits just three feet above sea level at its lowest point, could face problems from rising sea levels within the next 20 years

Inspiring: Mr Mitchell looked to Dubai's Palm Islands to develop his proposals for Sandbanks in Dorset. He has lived in the area for 20 years

The
 man behind the plans, Eddie Mitchell, a former chairman of AFC 
Bournemouth, says the structure  will also protect swathes of Sandbanks 
from devastating flooding.  There have been warnings that the 0.5 square
 mile peninsula, which sits just 3ft above sea level at its lowest 
point, could be threatened by rising sea levels within the next 20 
years.

As a precaution all
 new properties are now built 12ft above sea level, and studies are 
examining the need for further sea defences.

But
 Mr Mitchell, 59, who has built more than 100 homes in and around 
Sandbanks over the past 40 years, said money needs to be invested now.  

He said: ‘Some of the 
current sea defences date back 100 years or more and they need updating 
if we are to prevent Sandbanks from being cut off. It’s a big project 
but I’d love it to happen within the next 20 years or even sooner. Sea 
levels are rising and if we act now it will save us money in the long 
term.’

But the proposals are far from becoming a reality.

Yesterday
 Richard Genge, Poole council’s planning manager, said: ‘This is the 
first time we have seen images of Mr Mitchell’s vision.

‘We have not received a planning application and as such we are unable to comment on these proposals.’
