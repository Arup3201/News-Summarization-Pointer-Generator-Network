A 'devoted' husband bled to death after entering into a tragic suicide pact with his wife - which she survived.

John Gilbert, 76, and Mary Gilbert, 78, watched the sun set over a coastal beauty spot before cutting their wrists, an inquest heard today.

The former train engineer died moments later but his wife of 20 years survived the suicide attempt, which they had been planning for weeks.

She managed to flag down a passing motorist at Seven Sisters Country Park, near Seaford, East Sussex, on September 5 last year.

Mr Gilbert had suffered with depression for much of his life, Eastbourne Coroner’s Court heard.

Mr Gilbert, from Croydon, south London, decided in June last year that he wanted to end his life.

The couple moved to Brighton, which was described as his 'favourite place', and stayed at the Jury’s Inn hotel and Ambassadors Hotel.

Over the following weeks the pair planned the suicide pact and considered locations including Brighton Marina and Beachy Head.

They left their hotel for the final time on September 5, and handed staff a floral bag. It was later found to contain 'goodbye' letters addressed to family and friends.

There were also documents relating to outstanding bills.

Mrs Gilbert later told police they had caught the bus to the Seven Sisters Country Park, in the South Downs National Park.

She said they watched the sun set together and waited for everyone to go before carrying out their plan.

Mr Gilbert died soon after, and she made repeated failed attempts to take her own life.

She then made her way to the A259 and flagged down a passing motorist who called the emergency services.

Mrs Gilbert was taken to Brighton’s Royal Sussex County Hospital where she was treated and made a recovery.

Coroner Alan Craze recorded a verdict of suicide. Pathologist Dr Olaf Biedrzycki, gave a cause of death as a haemorrhage caused by lacerations to the wrist.

Speaking outside court, the couple’s son Stephen Gilbert, 56, paid tribute to the 'loving couple'.

He said: 'They had been together for 20 years. It was a caring, loving relationship, they were devoted.

'I think my dad decided and Mary went along with him because she was devoted to him.'
