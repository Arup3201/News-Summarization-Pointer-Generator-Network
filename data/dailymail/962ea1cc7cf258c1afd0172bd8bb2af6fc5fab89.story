Hertel wrote a note for the driver as part of her alleged misdeeds, KMOV said.

'Hey [expletive]. How about you park your car like a normal person you [expletive] head. Also, left you some presents in your gay car!' Hertel reportedly wrote.Â 

Police said in documents obtained by the Post-Dispatch that Hertel confessed to vandalism 'because the way [the car] was parked made her angry.'

The car suffered over $3,000 worth of damages, Capt. Steve Lewis told the newspaper. Hertel faces a first-degree property damage charge.

'Thousands of dollars of damage to a vehicle, it's entirely possible this person wasn't parked properly,' Lewis told KMOV. 'However, that doesn't mean that someone should take it upon themselves to damage their vehicle and damage their property.'
