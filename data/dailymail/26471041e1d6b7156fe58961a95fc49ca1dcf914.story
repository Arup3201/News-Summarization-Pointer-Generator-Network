Golfing great Greg Norman said he was 'one lucky man' to still have his left hand after slicing into his arm with a chainsaw while tree trimming at his Florida home.

The 59-year-old Australian needed surgery to repair nerve damage following the accident on Saturday.

In a phone call with the Today show on Monday, Norman said that his arm had been pulled down on the still-running chainsaw blade by a heavy tree limb.

The Australian professional golfer said he was 'one lucky man' after a horrifying chainsaw injury at his Florida home 

Norman said today: 'I'm pretty good, it was an interesting Saturday afternoon to say the least.'

The golfer said that he does a lot of chainsawing at his ranch in Colorado, 'so I'm not a rookie'.

He said that he went to grab a tree limb while trimming foliage at his south Florida home on Saturday with his left hand while he had the saw in his right with the blade still running.

Norman said that he had taken his finger off the trigger so the chain was slowing down but the heavy limb started coming straight down instead of falling away from him.

'The weight of the limb was heavier than I expected and it brought my arm right down on top of the blade and I heard this crunch,' he added. 

The golfer said that the chainsaw cut into his arm above his wrist where a watch would be worn. It missed his main artery by mere millimeters.

The 59-year-old told Today that before he went out chainsawing he had a 'premonition' that something would go wrong.

He said: 'Lo and behold, the moral of the story is trust your premonition. If I ever have that feeling again, I'm not doing what I'm supposed to be doing.'

The former world number one, who has won 91 golf events in his career including the British Open twice in the 1980s, posted an Instagram picture on Saturday of himself lying in a hospital bed with a heavily-bandaged left arm.

The image shows the former golfer lying in a hospital bed, hooked up to tubes and monitors. He wrote: ''I was one lucky man today. Damaged, but not down and out. Still have left hand.' 

'Working with a chainsaw ALWAYS be respectful of the unexpected. I was one lucky man today. Damaged, but not down & out. Still have left hand,' Norman, nicknamed the 'Great White Shark', said in a message on Twitter with the picture.

According to the Golf Channel on Sunday, Norman sustained no muscular damage in the accident, which occurred while he was cutting back trees on his property.

A week ago, Norman posted a picture of himself on Instagram working with a chainsaw to cut a small tree.

'Time to trim the sea grapes today. Never ask someone to do something that you can do yourself. Love to work!' he said.

On Sunday, Norman posted another Instagram, this time with him standing shirtless in front of the tree, giving a thumbs-up with his right hand while his left arm was protected by a purple foam brace.

'Thank u all for your concern & good wishes. All well the morning after the accident. Here I am at the scene of the crime w/my new fashion statement!' Norman said. 

He added: 'At least I can still play tennis.' 

Norman, who has won 91 professional world events and was ranked the world's best golfer during the peak of his career, now lives in Florida.
