A Michigan man convicted of fatally shooting a nine-year-old boy, who witnessed him kill two other men, has been sentenced to life in prison without parole.

Deonte Isaac Gray, 19, was given the sentence on Monday after previously being found guilty on three counts of first-degree premeditated murder charges.

He was convicted of the 2013 shootings involving Trashawn Macklin, a young boy who reportedly saw the killings of James Allen Jr., 25, and Akeem Easterling, 23, at an apartment in Flint.

A fourth murder charge against Gray was dropped after a witness disappeared. 

During the sentencing, Macklin's mother, Andrea Washington, had tears filled in her eyes as her son's Freeman Elementary School teacher Laura Garrison stood beside her.

Garrison told Gray his actions took away a young boy who was loved by everyone he ever touched, according to MLive.

She said she always tried to warn Macklin to avoid and walk away from potentially hostile situations.

The teacher, said: 'Unfortunately, he came across the same person we tried to protect him against.'

James Allen Jr.'s mother, Antoinette Moore, told Gray in an emotional statement that her son did not deserve to be taken away like that.

Gray was given the sentence on Monday for three counts of first-degree premeditated murder charges (above Janette Allen, a sister of one of the victims, cries in court)

Moore said of her son: 'He was a good person. He was.' 

The shootings were not Gray's first run-ins with the law as he previously was convicted of felonious assault and second-degree home invasion at the age of 15 in 2010.

Gray was sent to live at the Shawono Center in Grayling, a 40-bedroom facility to treat male juveniles from age 12-21 accused of one or multiple felonies, before he was moved to another facility, Murack Lodge, according to court records. 

The incident leading to his recent sentencing unfolded on July 15, when Gray reportedly got into an altercation with Easterling.

A shoving quarrel between the two men was ended after Gray shot Easterling before he then went to the apartment to tell Allen about the fight.

However, when he noticed Allen reaching for a gun in the nightstand, he shot him too, according to police.

As he was leaving the apartment, he realized Macklin had witnessed the shootings, and fired the gun at the boy.

Tips from police eventually led to his arrest and he was found in a relative's attic. 

Gray, during his sentencing, did not give an apology to the families of the victims, but did thank the court for its time.
