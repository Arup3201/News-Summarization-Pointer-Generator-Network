Good Morning America anchor Robin Roberts today announced that she is taking a medical leave for her bone marrow transplant, but will be gone longer than initially expected.

Roberts, who was not supposed to take her leave until late August or early September, announced last month that she has MDS, a blood and bone marrow disease once known as pre-leukemia.

She told viewers today: ‘A full disclosure here – I’m not feeling too well. In fact, I’m going to leave and let you all do the rest of the program on your own. I’ll see you in a couple of weeks.’

In time: Good Morning America anchor Robin Roberts, pictured on Monday, announced that Tuesday was her last day at the show until after her bone marrow transplant, scheduled for late August

She later said on her Twitter account that the additional time off was to prepare for her bone marrow transplant and to have some time away.

She also wrote: ‘Momma needs a vacation! Going to finish strong!’

Though she said she was feeling ill, the long-time host looked spectacular just a day before in a knee-length orange Michael Kors dress, pumps by Jimmy Choo, and jewellery by John Hardy.

In her absence, the top-ranking morning show will be hosted instead by Amy Robach and Lara Spencer, according to The Hollywood Reporter.

And during her absence from the ABC morning show, she'll be getting a little help from her friends in the news business.

Roberts, 51, listed Barbara Walters, Diane Sawyer and Katie Couric among her 'wonderful, wonderful friends at ABC News' who will be subbing for her. Others mentioned: talk-show host Kelly Ripa and panellists from the ABC talk show The View.

So long for now: Robin Roberts called it a 'terrific Tuesday,' and reiterated that she was taking time off ahead of her already scheduled medical leave

Last week, the ABC anchor told reporters gathered for the Television Critics Association conference in Beverly Hills, California, that her leave would 'most likely' start at the end of August or early September.

'It's fascinating-slash-scary how to prepare yourself for something like this,' she said, appearing by satellite from ABC's studios in New York. And when asked how she's feeling, she replied, 'I do go through moments of fatigue.'

But citing the continuing resurgence of Good Morning America against its long-dominant NBC rival Today, she brightened.

Blonde ambition: Katie Couric, seen speaking at a panel last week, will also help host

'The run that we've had has truly energized me,' she said. 'It's pretty good medicine, I gotta say, to be taking!'

In particular, ABC was crowing Thursday that, for the first time in 17 years, GMA had seized first place among total viewers (almost 4.6 million vs. 4.25million for Today) as well as tying Today for first place in the 25- to 54-year-old demographic, each with 1.74million.

ABC News President Ben Sherwood was inspired to frame the victory in Olympic terms.

'For 852 straight (weekly) races, the Today show won the gold medal, going back to 1995,' he said. Then, several weeks ago, GMA snapped the Today winning streak, 'and stood there alone for the first time in 16 years to get its own gold medal.'

'And after 879 weeks running behind in younger viewers, 25-to-54,' Sherwood went on, 'GMA' is 'standing there at the gold-medal podium, unbelievably in an actual statistical tie with the previous champs.'
