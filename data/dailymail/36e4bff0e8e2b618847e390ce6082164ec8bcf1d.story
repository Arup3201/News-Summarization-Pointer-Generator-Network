If Chelsea defender Gary Cahill isn't bored of tigers already, he certainly will be by the end of the week.

The England defender, who moved to the west London club from Bolton for £7million in January 2012, posted a picture of himself with the wild animal balloon to his Instagram.

Cahill was obviously enjoying some of his spare time with his young children, as alongside the picture was the message ‘Having a bit of play time with my kids’.

Cahill will be hoping that Chelsea can beat Hull City at the weekend to enhance title chances 

It is not the last time the 29-year-old will come face-to-face with the wild animal this week as the Blues face Hull City on Sunday.

Cahill and his teammates will be looking to earn all three points having failed to win either of their last two matches.

The defender told Chelsea TV: ‘We’re desperate… not desperate, it’s the wrong word. We’re just looking for the next convincing win to get us back up and running.’
