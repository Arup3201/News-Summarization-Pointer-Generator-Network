Manuel Pellegrini has ruled Yaya Toure and Wilfried Bony out of Manchester City's clash with Stoke on Wednesday. 

The duo are preparing for Sunday's Africa Cup of Nations final against Ghana on Sunday, but City fans will have to wait until later in the month to see the pair in action. 

‘We don’t want both of them to come back so quickly because it is impossible for them to play on Wednesday (against Stoke).

'After that we have 10 days without a game so they have time to come back.’ 

The duo could return for City's home match against Newcastle on February 21, which would also be Bony's debut for the Premier League champions.

Pellegrini has no fears about the safety of Toure and Bony, despite violent scenes marring the end of Ghana’s semi-final win over hosts Equatorial Guinea on Thursday. 

‘It wasn’t the best thing to finish that game but I don’t think that will happen in the future,’ said Pellegrini. 

‘We have the normal contact that we need to have with both of them. I don’t think they will have any problems. The most important thing is for them to win that cup.

Meanwhile, Pellegrini has insisted Stevan Jovetic still has a big role to play at City, despite being replaced by Bony in the club's Champions League squad. 

Stevan Jovetic is reportedly very upset at losing out his Champions League place to accommodate Bony

'It is always difficult to take a player out of the list but we have restrictions this year (due to breaches of financial fair play),' explained Pellegrini. 'We brought Bony because I think that we need another striker, a box player, and in the position of Jovetic maybe we have some other options. 

'It is a difficult decision but I think it was the best for the squad.

'He continues being very important player. If we didn’t have the restrictions we’d have another place. He’s a good professional and I’m sure we’ll see him playing in the Premier League.'
