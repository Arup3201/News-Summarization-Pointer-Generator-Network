A 22-year-old man has been arrested following a 'gang-related' high school shooting in Oregon that left three students injured and a 16-year-old girl in a critical condition. 

The unnamed gunman, who is believed to have gang ties, reportedly gunned down the students at a street corner outside Rosemary Anderson High School in Portland at noon on Friday.

He then allegedly fled the scene by car, but was stopped by police at North Interstate Avenue and Going Street at around 1.30am on Saturday. A handgun was found in his vehicle.

Taylor Michelle Zimmers remains critically injured in hospital following the shooting, while 20-year-old David Jackson-Liday and 17-year-old La'Braye Franklin are said to be in a fair condition.

A fourth victim, Olyvia Batson, also 17, was treated at the scene after a bullet grazed her foot.

Scene: A 22-year-old male suspect has been arrested following the 'gang-related' shooting at noon on Friday

Speaking to The Oregonian, student Sierra Smith said she saw one of the male victims being helped by a teacher inside the alternative high school, describing the scene as 'scary'.

'He was laying on the ground. He had blood coming out of his stomach,' the 17-year-old said.

Another student, Oliviann Danley, 16, told the newspaper she saw a boy run into the school and shout, 'Oh my God, did I just get shot?'

Emergency services were scrambled to Rosemary Anderson High - an alternative institution for dropouts and other at-risk or homeless students - within minutes of the shooting. 

The attack is believed to have occurred following a dispute. The assailant and two other people fled, while the wounded students went to the school for help, a police spokesman said.

In a statement on Friday night, Sargent Pete Simpson, of Portland Police, 'There was some kind of dispute between the shooter and some people.

'We don't know if it was (with) all the victims or one of the victims. Based on the investigation thus far, the shooting appears to be gang-related.'

Police gang investigators 'feel comfortable saying this is a gang-related shooting based on some of the people involved,' Mr Simpson added.

He said the shooter is believed to have gang ties, but declined to say whether any victims might.

Following the shooting, parents were quickly summoned to the school to collect their children, while a nearby high school and community college were put on lockdown. 

After authorities tracked down the suspect in the early hours of Saturday, officers were dispatched to search the man's an apartment, about five blocks east of the shooting.

The victims are students at the high school or in affiliated job training programs, the force said. 

On Friday night, Portland Mayor, Charlie Hales, wrote on Facebook: 'My heart goes out to students and staff at Rosemary Anderson High School, which today experienced a terrible tragedy.

'It was heartwarming to see the community wrap its arms around victims' friends and families. I know we'll all be holding our loved ones a little closer tonight. Go home and hug your kids.' 

According to Rosemary Anderson High's website, 190 students annually are enrolled at the north Portland location. The school also has a second location in Gresham.

Gang violence in Portland is not a new phenomenon. Some of the violence occurs between rival gangs, but bystanders have also been hurt. 

'We've made a lot of progress in addressing the gang problem, but we haven't eradicated it,' Mr Hales said in a statement on Friday. 'Today's really a sad reminder that it's still with us.'

Over the summer, Portland police have apparently seen a spike in gang crime - a problem they have complained they do not have adequate resources to address.

Recent violence includes a man killed in a drive-by-shooting and another shot dead in a separate shooting. A five-year-old boy also was shot in the leg while playing at an apartment complex.

A Multnomah County report on gang activity released in June said crime in the county that includes Portland actually decreased from 2005 to 2012.

As inner-city Portland gentrifies, the report said, criminal activity is shifting from northern neighborhoods to areas farther east, including the city of Gresham.

The north Portland neighborhood where the shooting occurred exemplifies the trend. Before Friday, the place once known for gangs had not had a shooting with injuries in nearly four years.

'It brings up a lot of old wounds,' Mr Simpson said.

Dani Gonzales, 64, who has lived in the neighborhood for 25 years, said it generally safe but there has always been some gang activity.

'Kids just get silly and get crazy ideas. I don't know what goes on in their heads,' Mr Gonzales said.

There was another school shooting in the Portland area in June, but it was not gang-related.

A freshman killed another boy in a locker room, and a bullet grazed a teacher before the shooter went into a bathroom and died from a self-inflicted gunshot, police said. 

The attack came just two days before the two-year anniversary of the Sandy Hook shooting, when gunman Adam Lanza killed 20 children and six adults in Newton, Connecticut.

Police are investigating the latest shooting.
