The number of suicides across the military fell by more than 15 percent in 2013, despite more Army National Guard and Reserve soldiers taking their own lives last year than the year before.

According to data gathered by The Associated Press from major military braches, 151 active soldiers killed themselves in 2013.

That is 24 less than the year before, with 185 taking their own lives in 2012.

However it wasn't all good news, with a separate 152 members of the Army National Guard and Reserve took their own lives last year, compared to 140 the previous year.

There were 289 active duty suicides across all major military branches in 2013, down from 343 in 2012.

The drop in overall suicides may be a promising sign for the Pentagon, which has been actively increasing prevention efforts to help those at risk of taking their own lives.

According to an official report released by the Pentagon, almost 93 percent of military suicides were male, 74 percent were white and almost 40 percent were between 17-24.

Some 65 percent used a firearm; almost 76 percent of those used a gun that was not issued by the military, while 25 percent died of asphyxiation, including hanging.

More than 33 percent tested positive for alcohol use; about 24 percent tested positive for drugs

However, military leaders are not being quick to call the slight decreases a victory.

'I think we've changed the cultural mindset — that it's O.K. for a sailor or a soldier or an airman or Marine to come forward and ask for help,' said Navy Rear Adm. Sean Buck, who is in charge of suicide prevention for his branch of the armed services.

'We're trying to reduce the stigma that used to exist.'

The Pentagon is expected to release its own suicide data Friday.

While the numbers are expected to differ slightly, one issue will remain unchanged: the slight increase in Army National Guard and Reserves soldiers who committed suicide in 2013 compared to 2012.

The AP reports many reservists that committed suicide served in Iraq and Afghanistan, though there is no evident link between service and suicide.

Also featured in the report was ...

— 55 percent of unsuccessful suicide attempts involved drugs

— 42 percent had a history of some type of behavioral health diagnosis

— More than 28 percent had talked about harming themselves prior to the suicide

— 40 percent reported family or relationship stress in the 90 days prior to suicide; 32 percent reported financial or work stress

— 57 percent had been deployed

— 47 percent had been deployed to the Iraq or Afghanistan wars
