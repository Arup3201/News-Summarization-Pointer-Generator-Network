Theresa May has been warned that a feud between the Home Office and Downing Street is damaging her chances of succeeding David Cameron

Theresa May has been given an extraordinary warning that a toxic feud between the Home Office and Downing Street is damaging her chances of succeeding David Cameron as Tory leader.

A senior party source said support for the steely Home Secretary as the Prime Minister’s successor was being ‘seriously undermined’ by a row that has led to two of her senior advisers’ bids to become MPs at the general election being scuppered by Tory HQ and Downing Street.

‘How can Theresa not see that having her advisers running around behaving badly is harming the support she will need from a bunch of Cabinet ministers if she does go for the leadership?’ the source said.

Last week it emerged David Cameron personally approved the suspension of Nick Timothy and Stephen Parkinson from the approved list of Tory candidates, ostensibly because they refused to campaign in the Rochester by-election because they believed it would breach civil service rules.

Mrs May is understood to have been told there is ‘absolutely no chance’ of her two advisers being reinstated as candidates in time to run as candidates next May.

Tory chairman Grant Shapps insists civil service rules were changed to allow special advisers to take part in telephone canvassing and Mr Timothy and Mr Parkinson were simply being ‘awkward’ by declining to take part.

However, the move against them came after Mr Timothy was linked to criticism of Mr Cameron in a magazine profile of Mrs May.

Number Ten is known to be exasperated by speculation about the Home Secretary’s leadership ambitions and her camp’s criticism of what they see as as incompetence in the Prime Minister’s political operation.

Veteran former Cabinet minister Kenneth Clarke, who clashed with Mrs May when they were in Cabinet together, praised her as one of the most impressive figures in the Government and called for an end to the ‘spat’ that has exploded into the open.

‘It’s quite entertainingly newsworthy but somebody should stop all their entourages falling out with each other,’ Mr Clarke told the BBC’s Andrew Marr programme.

‘The relations between the people themselves are good. Theresa is one of the strongest ministers in the government. Any prime minister – and David is very sensible about this – accepts he wants strong ministers at the top of his government. The entourage seem to be having a little spat between themselves.’

Chancellor George Osborne is said to have been concerned by a surge in support for Mrs May among party activists, among whom she is now the clear favourite to succeed Mr Cameron, though sources insisted he had played no role in the suspension of Mr Timothy and Mr Parkinson.

One of the Home Secretary’s supporters was yesterday quoted as saying: ‘Osborne is obsessed with having spies everywhere so he can either succeed Cameron or be kingmaker. Theresa has every right to protect her own interests.

‘That is not disloyalty and she will not be intimidated by anyone in Downing Street.’

Tory backbencher Nadine Dorries said: ‘The man pulling the strings is Osborne, not Cameron.

‘Osborne is desperate to ensure he has enough MPs in place to vote him on to the shortlist of two, which is put before members to choose the next leader, should there be a contest in 2015. Those two are likely to be Boris Johnson and Theresa May.’

She added: ‘If Nick and Stephen become MPs that is two more votes for Theresa and two fewer for George. Theresa has had a lot to put up with. The more popular she is among party members, the nastier it becomes in Westminster.’

Mrs May has repeatedly stressed her loyalty to Mr Cameron and personal relations between the two remain reasonable, though she has never been part of his inner circle.

However, the Home Secretary, dubbed ‘Britain’s Angela Merkel’ by allies, is thought to regard Mr Johnson as a ‘faintly ridiculous’ figure and would run against him if the Tories lose in May and Mr Cameron is forced to quit.
