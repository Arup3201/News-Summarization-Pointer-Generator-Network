They made history at New Jersey's Metlife Stadium in the days before Super Bowl, now the legends of football are making a comeback at the other Met.

New York's Metropolitan Museum of Art will exhibit 150 vintage trading cards, featuring football greats such as Frank Gifford and Kenny Washington, from January 24.

Beginning with a series from 1894, the pristine cards are among 300,000 donated to the Met by the late collector and cataloger Jefferson Burdick.

The cards, which all predate the founding of a national football 
league in 1920 and the first Super Bowl in 1967, were inserted into such products as candy, gum and tobacco.

Many of the sets are beautiful color 
lithographs that depict the players in action.

A 1935 National Chicle 
Gum Company set includes Hall of Famer Turk Edwards, a Washington State 
tackle whose nine-year NFL career with the Washington Redskins ended 
after an injury during a coin toss in a 1940 game against the New York 
Giants.

There's also a 
1936 Chicle luxury set of black and white photos that includes 
University of Illinois running back Harold 'Red' Grange, who went on to 
play with the Chicago Bears and whose speed earned him the moniker 'The 
Galloping Ghost'.

The earliest cards, produced by the P.H.
 Mayo Tobacco company, featured black and white photos of Ivy League 
football stars in collegiate sweaters.

Other 
notable players include Kenneth Washington, the first black player in 
the NFL who broke the color barrier, and Hall of Famer Sid Luckman, one 
of the first Jewish players in professional football.

There's also a 
1952 rookie card of Frank Gifford, who was the New York Giants' No. 1 
draft pick.

However the rarest card in the exhibition is of 
John Dunlop from Harvard. He is the only player in the series whose name
 and school affiliation were inexplicably omitted.

It's
 not known how many Dunlop cards are in existence but one in perfect 
condition can sell for $15,000 to $20,000, said Bob Swick, publisher and
 editor of Gridirons Greats magazine.

Among
 the greats, the collection features Notre Dame coach Knute Rockne, 
whose career included six national college championships and entry into 
the Hall of Fame in 1951, the first year of induction.

The sport began as an intercollegiate game that fused soccer and rugby. Athletic clubs eventually formed football leagues.

The most powerful, the Ohio League, became the American Professional Football Conference in 1920 before changing its name to the National Football League two years later.

The first Super Bowl came about only after the formation of the American Football League in 1960.

Rare: This 1894 football card of Harvard's John Dunlop is the rarest in the collection. Collectors regard it as the Honus Wagner of football cards because Dunlop is the only player in the series whose name and school affiliation is missing, and he was only identified a decade ago

With the Super Bowl being played February 2 
in nearby East Rutherford, New Jersey, the first time the game is being held 
outdoors in a cold-weather city, organizing the 'Gridiron Greats' 
exhibition was a natural, said Freyda Spira, the Met's assistant curator
 of the department of drawings and prints.

While
 some may view such an exhibition at the Met as an anomaly, the Burdick 
collection is part of the museum's mission to include printed material 'for a mass public,' Spira said.

'Commercially
 printed lithographs are part of our printed visual culture,' she added.

'It's viewed within the spectrum of what art is.'

Burdick, an electrician from Syracuse, New York, began donating his 300,000-card collection to the Met in 1947.

In organizing the material at the Met over a 15-year period, Burdick devised a classification system that has become the standard for cataloging trading cards.

He died in 1963.

Burdick's collection has offered the museum ample material for special exhibitions over the years.

He amassed 30,000 baseball cards.

The Met is presenting the pop-up exhibition celebrating 
football's history through the ages with vintage trading cards from January 24 to February 10.

Other museums in and around the city presenting Super Bowl-related exhibitions include The Children's Museum of Manhattan, the Museum of the Moving Image in Queens and the Liberty Science Center in Jersey City, New Jersey.
