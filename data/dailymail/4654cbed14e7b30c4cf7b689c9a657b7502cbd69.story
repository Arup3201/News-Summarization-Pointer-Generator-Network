Micky Adams is set to be appointed as the new manager of Tranmere Rovers.

The League Two club sacked manager Rob Edwards after just five months in charge.

But the club have moved quickly to find an appointment and have held talks with Adams over the vacant job.

Adams left Port Vale in September after a disappointing start to the season, but is now set for a return to the game with Tranmere.

Rovers were relegated last season and are sitting at the bottom of the league with just nine points from their 12 matches.

Edwards had replaced John McMahon at the end of May but was moved on after Rovers' slumped to their seventh game without a win and fourth loss in a row at home to Plymouth on Saturday.

Rovers chairman Mark Palios told the club's official website, tranmererovers.co.uk: 'Rob is a decent man who has worked very hard over the past few months for the football club.

'However, with the club currently sitting at the bottom of League 2 for the first time in 32 years it was decided this was the right time to make the break.

Palios said the club's next manager would need to able to work the transfer market and be adept at recruiting quality players. 

Adams stepped down as Port Vale manager last month, ending his second stint in charge at Vale Park after three and a half years with a run of six straight losses in all competitions.
