Almost half of adults overestimate how big their waists can get before it potentially has an impact on their hearts, a survey has found.

Medical opinion is that women are at increased risk of heart disease if their waist strays over 32 inches, while men should not exceed 37 inches.

However, over 40 per cent of respondents thought their bellies had to be bigger to do any harm, and 20 per cent thought they could get away with a waist size of 40 inches for men and 35 inches for women.

Almost half of adults overestimate how big their waists can get before it may have an impact on their hearts

The figures in the online YouGov poll relate to 46 per cent of men and 43 per cent of women.

Overall, fewer than half of adults (42 per cent) were aware of the threshold for high blood pressure (a reading of 140/90) which can increase the risk of heart attack and stroke, and almost half of adults (46 per cent) didn’t know what a healthy Body Mass Index is.

Body Mass Index is calculated by dividing your weight in kilograms by your height in metres squared. A healthy BMI is between 18.5 and 25.

The survey also found that more than a third of people (34 per cent) underestimated how much exercise they should be doing a week.

Only 15 per cent knew that adults are advised to do 30 minutes of exercise, five times a week to maintain a healthy heart yet.

The charity says the findings, published to coincide with World Heart Day, mean that millions of people are putting the health of their heart at risk because they are not taking the necessary steps to prevent heart disease.

Heart disease ranks bottom of the list of health concerns for most people even though it is the UK’s single biggest killer claiming 73,000 lives a year.

Just two per cent of Britons are afraid of developing the condition, according to the poll of over 2,000 people for the British Heart Foundation.

This compares with 33 per cent who worry about developing dementia, 29 per cent who are afraid of cancer, nine per cent who dread Motor Neurone Disease and six per cent who fear a stroke.

The only conditions to rank alongside heart disease are Parkinson’s and the Ebola virus.

Furthermore, although most people are aware of the risk factors for developing heart disease, such as high blood pressure, being overweight, a sedentary lifestyle and poor diet, they don’t actually know what this means.

It also raises the question why despite huge awareness campaigns for heart disease, the messages are not getting through.

Dr Mike Knapton, Associate Medical Director at the British Heart Foundation, said: ‘Your heart is the most vital organ in your body, but all too often we take it for granted.

‘Despite being a largely preventable condition, coronary heart disease is still the UK’s single biggest killer, causing unnecessary heartache for thousands of families.

'By taking control of your heart health, you can invest in and enjoy your future health and life.’

Maureen Talbot, a Senior Cardiac Nurse at the charity, added: ‘There are still people out there that think heart disease will never happen to them and are shocked when it does.

‘Showing the benefits of reducing risk factors is quite a slow process and although things have improved, it is not always obvious. There is always more than can be done to get the right message out at the right time.’
