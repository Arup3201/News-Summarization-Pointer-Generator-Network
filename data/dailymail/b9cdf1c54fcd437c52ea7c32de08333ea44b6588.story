Shadow defence secretary Jim Murphy said that once the Euro had resolved its problems 'the time for the referendum will be upon us'

A referendum on Britain’s membership of the European Union should be held once the Eurozone crisis is over, a senior member of Ed Miliband’s frontbench team said today.

Jim Murphy, the shadow defence secretary, claimed ‘almost everyone’ in the Labour party would campaign for Britain to stay in the EU.

There are growing signs of that Labour could still a march on the Conservatives and promise to hold a vote on the EU after the next election.

Last night Douglas Alexander, the shadow foreign secretary, insisted there was ‘ almost total unanimity for Britain’s continued membership in the European Union’ in the Labour party.

However, some senior Labour figures are understood to be unenthusiastic about the prospect of having to defend a Brussels bureaucracy which they believe is bloated and runs counter to Britain’s interests.

Jon Cruddas, who is leading Labour’s policy review, last week said he would examine the case for an in/out referendum. 

But former leader Lord Kinnock described the prospect of a referendum as ‘a gigantic distraction (which) would disable political and economic activity in the rest of the EU’.

However, other senior members of the Labour frontbench now think such a vote is inevitable.

Mr Murphy today told BBC2's Daily 
Politics show : ‘I think at some point, there will have to be a 
referendum on the EU ... I don't think it's for today or for the next 
year, but I think it should happen.’

He
appeared to be agreeing with Lord Mandelson, who last week suggested 
the Eurozone will be smaller after the single currency had resolved its 
problems and settled on a new political and fiscal deal.

Mr Murphy said: ‘I think after that, the time for the referendum will be upon us.

‘I don't have a calendar with a date circled. I think we will do it when the time is right.

‘My preference would be an in-or-out referendum when the time comes.

‘Whenever the referendum comes, almost everyone in the Labour Party, along with the Liberal Democrats and British business, will be arguing we should stay part of the EU, because it is good for our economy and good for Britain.’

However tonight the party tried to play down Mr Murphy's remarks.

A senior Labour source said: 'No one can fully predict where Europe will be in a few months' time, nevermind a few years' time.

'So Labour is very clear on this. This is not a decision we could or should sensibly make now.'

The issue of Europe is expected to dominate the Conservative party conference next week.

The UK Independence Party has offered to form an electoral pact and not challenge Eurosceptic Tory MPs at the 2015 election, but only if Mr Cameron commit to a referendum ‘in blood’. The same deal could apply yo Labour.

In interviews last week the Prime Minister Cameron hinted that he might be ready to call an EU referendum after the 2015 general election.

He said that the coming years would see ‘opportunities for a new settlement between Britain and Europe’ which would require ‘fresh consent from the British people’.

UKIP leader leader Nigel Farage said today: 'First it was the Tories offering the British people consent on the never-never. Now we see Labour doing much the same.

'It won't wash. Poll after poll shows that we want a say, we want it now, and we want it on a simple, transparent question. In or out.

'The political elite are running scared of public opinion on our relationship with the EU. Muddying the waters, writing promissory notes about what might happen in 10 years' time, is no longer acceptable.'
