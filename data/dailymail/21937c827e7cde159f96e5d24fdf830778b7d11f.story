They were the glamorous Jeffrey Epstein aides who refused to testify about Prince Andrew’s visits to the ‘House of Sin’.

Sarah Kellen and Nadia Marchinova both pleaded their right to silence under the US Fifth Amendment when asked if the royal had sex with teenage girls – earning themselves the nickname the ‘blondes who took the Fifth’.

Today, Epstein’s former PA Miss Kellen and Miss Marchinova – his on-off girlfriend – have reinvented themselves as Sarah Kensington and Nadia Marcinko.

Miss Kensington, 34, is an interior designer who boasts of renovating corporate apartments in New York, the Caribbean and Paris – and dating a handsome racing car driver.

Miss Marcinko, 29, is a pilot and the chief executive of Aviloop, a company selling discounted flying lessons.

Intriguingly, they both operate from £1.5million addresses in a Manhattan building majority-owned by Mr Epstein’s brother Mark. Neither woman seems keen to draw attention to their past work for the billionaire paedophile.

Both women were given immunity from prosecution in a controversial deal fixed by Epstein when he was jailed for soliciting prostitution from underage girls.

Miss Kellen was named as the chief fixer who travelled the world with Epstein and was accused by lawyers in legal filings of ‘bringing girls to Epstein’s mansion to be abused’.

Quizzed under oath, she had an opportunity to deny Andrew had sex at the £6million Florida mansion, dubbed the ‘House of Sin’, but chose to remain silent.

Citing the Fifth Amendment, Miss Marchinova also declined to say if she had sex with Andrew.

Since those scandal-engulfed days, both women have led dramatically different lives, a Mail investigation has discovered.

Miss Kellen moved to Hawaii for a number of years where she married and took her husband’s surname Bonk, before taking on her current identity.

On her interior design website, sarahkensington.net, she describes being ‘fortunate to say that I’ve been able to travel to many locations around the world, which in turn has broadened my designing skills’.

She is in a relationship with a successful Nascar driver, stating on her website that ‘most of my fans know that I am Brian Vickers’ girlfriend’.

Slovakia-born Miss Marcinko’s biography on the Aviloop website now states: ‘Over the years, she has proven herself to be a distinguished entrepreneur’.

She also penned an online blog under the name ‘Gulfstream Girl’ which more than 77,000 people ‘liked’, until the company Gulfstream objected and she changed it to ‘Global Girl’.

She described how she started her flight training at Palm Beach Airport before accepting ‘an offer from a friend’ to obtain her Gulfstream II pilot rating.

Epstein, 61, is said to have gone to extraordinary efforts to cover-up his vile crimes, promising to ‘look after’ people who kept quiet.

His brother Mark told The Guardian newspaper he owned ‘the majority of the units in the Manhattan building’ and had never heard of the two women’s companies.

He said Jeffrey did not own any of the units in the building, adding: ‘They’re rentals. The ones I own, I rent all of them out.’

It was also claimed yesterday that Epstein intimidated a pregnant journalist by asking where she was due to give birth.

British-born writer Vicky Ward was so afraid of the US financier that she had security put on the intensive care ward where her premature twins were being treated.

The Cambridge-educated journalist, 45, said he tried to ‘control’ her when he learned she was writing an in-depth article about him for Vanity Fair magazine in 2002.

Describing how Epstein ‘spooked’ her, she said he feared he was ‘coming for my little ones’ when he asked at which hospital she was giving birth.
