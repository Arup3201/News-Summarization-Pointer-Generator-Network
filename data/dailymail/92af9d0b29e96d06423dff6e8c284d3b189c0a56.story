The Prince of Wales recalled his days of diving in the 'lentil soup' of the Solent as he visited the new £35m museum housing the remains of the Mary Rose today.

Charles, who is president of the Mary Rose Trust, was accompanied by the Duchess of Cornwall during his visit to the purpose-built museum at Portsmouth Historic Dockyard, Hampshire.

The centre opened last year re-uniting the Tudor hull with thousands of artefacts for the first time since they were lifted from the seabed in 1982.

The Duchess of Cornwall looked a little 
nervous to be so close to the action during a demonstration by the 
Ship's medical team. After getting used to the very realistic demo, 
Camilla was enthusiastically asking questions of the team and their 
work.

Charles has been actively involved with the flagship of Henry VIII's navy since his first dive on the wreck on July 30, 1974, and has followed the project ever since.

He was one of the last people to dive down to the Mary Rose wreck in 1982, before watching the hull being raised from the site just outside Portsmouth Harbour where it was sunk in battle in 1545.

During his visit, Charles had a chance to handle some of the artefacts as well as have a go with a replica longbow.

He said afterwards: 'I don't want to put my shoulder out.'

After removing his protective gear that he wore for his helicopter ride, Prince Charles showed off his good manners by being the perfect gentleman and offering his hand to support Camilla step down a ramp

He also met pupils of St John's Cathedral Primary School and St Swithun's Catholic Primary School in Portsmouth who were learning in the Stavros Niarchos Learning Suite about the use of ballast to prevent ships from keeling over as the Mary Rose did.

Catherine Hobbs, executive headteacher of both schools, told the prince that she had heard an interview on the radio with him talking about diving on the wreck site, from 40 years ago, to which he replied: 'Oh gosh, that's a bit worrying.'

In a speech to fundraisers and volunteers, Charles spoke of his time diving with archaeologists on the wreck site just outside Portsmouth Harbour.

The wind couldn't damper Camilla's smile. Carrying a purple bouquet of flowers, Camilla seemed to be enjoying her day in Portsmouth

He said: 'I remember my days of diving on the ship out in the Solent in the most impossible conditions, it was like swimming in a kind of lentil soup, you couldn't see anything, or so I thought, until it was under your nose.

'What I could never get over was the sheer expertise of the archaeologists operating under water.'

He also described the day when the wreck was lifted from the seabed using a crane that was on loan for only one day.

He explained that he encouraged the crew to get on with the job despite technical difficulties including poor weather.

Charles recalled: 'I remember my days of diving on the ship out in the Solent in the most impossible conditions, it was like swimming in a kind of lentil soup, you couldn't see anything, or so I thought, until it was under your nose'

The duo toured the new Mary Rose Museum, viewing the ship itself, which is currently undergoing conservation, and artefacts recovered from the wreck, meeting staff, supporters and volunteers

He continued: 'I will never forget the almighty crash as the chains came down and I thought it was all my fault.'

He added: 'I think it was worth taking the risk as we have this truly remarkable example of a Tudor warship which is unique.'

As they left the museum, Camilla took the opportunity in the gift shop to buy a cuddly toy of the ship's dog Hatch, a skeleton of which is on display in the museum, and some children's colouring books.

Outside the museum, the couple greeted schoolchildren outside and on the deck of HMS Victory and Charles spoke to some of the youngsters in French asking them if they had enjoyed visiting the ships.
