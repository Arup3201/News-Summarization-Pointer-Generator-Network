A 33-year-old man is being sought in connection with the murder of a keen cyclist whose body was found abandoned in an old mine works.

David Alderson, 72, from Falmouth, Cornwall, was found dead in the grounds of the works at Wheal Maid near Carharrack in Cornwall earlier this month.

Officers from Devon and Cornwall police initially believed Mr Alderson may have suffered a serious cycling accident, but today they announced they have launched a murder investigation.

Detectives are 'urgently seeking' Kevin Cooper, 33, from Redruth and have advised members of the public not to approach him but dial 999 if they see him.

Superintendent Jim Pearce said: 'I want to reassure the public as best I can that, whilst we are advising people not to approach Mr Cooper, we have no reason to believe that there is any threat to the public in general.

'We have committed significant resources to finding Mr Cooper including increasing police patrols in areas he may be.'

A dog walker found Mr Alderson's body in the grounds of the mine works on Saturday, January 18. The dead man was wearing a blue fleece, dark Ron Hill running trousers and black Specialised Sport TR cycling shoes.

He was also wearing a pair of brown gardening gloves, and a pair of spectacles was found nearby, along with a black baseball cap.

Mr Cooper, described as white, 6ft 3ins, with brown, straight, receding hair and blue eyes, has been reported missing by his family.

He has a tattoo of a rose and the word Nan on the right side of his neck and is missing two upper teeth.
