He can make a grown conservative man cry -- Bruce Springsteen, that is.

Chris Christie, the tough-talking Republican governor of New Jersey, says he wept tears of joy after embracing his music idol on Friday, calling the moment they met a major highlight during a tough week.

The two Jersey men met at a benefit concert for victims of Hurricane Sandy, Christie said during a news conference on Monday.

Public Appearance: New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie holds a press conference outside the Joseph Bolger Middle School in Keansburg, N.J., where he speaks to residents a week after Hurricane Sandy hit the area.

The Boss: U.S. singer Bruce Springsteen performs during a campaign rally for President Barack Obama in Columbus, Ohio, on November 5, 2012.

'We hugged. He told me, "It’s official. We’re friends."' Christie said.Christie considers himself among Springsteen’s biggest fans and says he’s attended more than 100 of his concerts.

The hug from Springsteen came after Christie met with President Barack Obama to survey Sandy’s damage along the Jersey Shore last week.

Campaign Allies: President Barack Obama and Springsteen wave to a crowd of 18,000 people in Madison, Wisconsin, during a rally on the last day of campaigning in the general election.

Christie said he later spoke with Springsteen on Monday while discussing storm-related issues with Obama. Obama handed the phone to Springsteen, who was traveling with him as part of a campaign trip to swing states.

'(Obama) told me in times of difficulty that the only thing better than one Jersey guy is two Jersey guys,' Christie said.

Christie has repeatedly praised Obama's handling of the crisis caused by Sandy, while continuing to back Mitt Romney as presidential candidate of choice.

Political Ties: Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney looks on as Christie speaks during a January campaign rally at Exeter High School in New Hampshire.

Some people within the Romney campaign have rebuked Christie for the compliments he has given Obama for his handling of the Hurricane Sandy crisis, according to The Chicago Tribune.

Campaign insiders say that Christie was Romney’s first pick for Vice Presidential candidate, before the campaign settled on Paul Ryan, Politico reports.

Springsteen, a known liberal, had never publicly acknowledged Christie before they met on Friday.
