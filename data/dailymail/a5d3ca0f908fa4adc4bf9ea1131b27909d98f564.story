A convicted Arizona serial killer whose body was discovered last month in an isolation cell committed suicide by overdosing on antidepressants, it was revealed today.

Dale Hausner, 40, was found guilty in a series of random shootings on pedestrians, bicyclists and animals that terrorized the Phoenix area between 2005 and 2006.

The former airport janitor was given six death sentences and hundreds of years in prison for shooting dead six people and attacking 19 others in the course of 14 months.

Death in gaol: Hausner was found dead his cell at the Eyman state prison complex in Florence June 19

Hausner was found unresponsive June 19 in his cell at the Eyman state prison complex in Florence. He was pronounced dead about an hour later at a hospital in Anthem, according to Arizona Department of Corrections officials.

Forensic pathologist Dr. Gregory Hess, of the Pinal County Medical Examiner's Office, said the cause of death was ‘amitriptyline intoxication.’ Amitriptyline is one of a variety of antidepressant medications sold under the brand name Elavil

A toxicology report stated that Hauser had more than 50 times the recommended dose of the drug in his system.

Prison officials said it wasn't immediately clear how Hausner obtained the antidepressants. DOC officials said the department was conducting a complete investigation into the circumstances of Hausner's death and the autopsy report was part of that probe.

The report stated that Hausenr had left a suicide note, but its contents have not been revealed.

Attorney Tim Agan, who represented Hausner during the trial told the station AZ Central that his former had been contemplating suicide for years, and that his fellow inmates on Death Row knew that he was stockpiling drugs.

‘My understanding is the other inmates knew it was coming,’ Agan said.

Hausner always denied any involvement in the attacks and suggested his former roommate might have carried out some of the crimes.

Hausner was arrested in August 2006 with his roommate, Sam Dieteman, at the apartment they shared in the Phoenix suburb of Mesa. Inside, police found guns, news clippings of the killings and a city map marked with the locations of some of the shootings.

Dieteman, who pleaded guilty in two of the killings and was sentenced to life in prison, testified against Hausner, saying they cruised around late at night looking for strangers to shoot.

The ‘serial shooter’ attacks and an unrelated ‘Baseline Killer’ case kept neighborhood watch groups on high alert in the summer of 2006. Families stayed inside and authorities called meetings that drew hundreds of people.

Death wish: Since his convictions, Hausner had waived his appeals and asked in a letter to the court 'to be executed as soon as possible'

Police said their big break came when one of Dieteman's drinking buddies called police to say Dieteman had bragged about shooting people.

On March 13, 2009, Hausner was convicted of 80 crimes, including six counts of first-degree murder, attempted murder, aggravated assault, cruelty to animals and other charges, according to the station AZ Family.

Last victim: Hausner shot dead Robin Blasnek, 22, in Mesa on July 30, 2006, marking the end of his bloody rampage

Hausner was found guilty of murdering David Estrada, Nathaniel Shoffner, Jose Ortis, Marco Carillo, Claudia Gutierrez-Cruz, and Robin Blasnek.

Even though Hausner had denied any involvement, he took an odd turn during the penalty phase of his trial when he apologized to the families of every victim.

Since his convictions, Hausner had waived his appeals and asked in a letter to the court ‘to be executed as soon as possible.’

The 40-year-old inmate was scheduled to attend a hearing to determine if he was competent to waive the appeals.

Dale Hausner’s brother Randy said, ‘It’s a shame it happened this way rather than the victims getting a final say at his execution, but either way, it’s over.’

County authorities have said that while he was awaiting trial in 2006, Hausner tried to kill himself with an overdose of cold tablets.

Following Hausner's death last month, his most recent lawyer, Garrett Simpson, said, ‘I have rarely met a person who had a more miserable life.

‘He was a very wounded soul, and I am really sorry his life worked out like that, and that's taking nothing from the appalling losses that were afflicted.’
