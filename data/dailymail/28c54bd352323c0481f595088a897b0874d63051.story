As a married marketing executive and mother to a teenage son, Isabel Young could never have imagined the career path she would eventually follow. But finding herself single and lonely at the age of 55, she decided she wanted to do something completely different - and signed up to become a sex line worker.

Isabel (not her real name), from Leeds, now logs on with a sex line company for a couple of hours an evening and takes calls from men looking for, as she puts it, 'relief'.

She told the MailOnline: 'I get a real cross-section of callers of men of all ages looking for a good time. But the majority are just lonely and want someone to talk to.

'The older men tend to stay on the phone longer for general conversation and some smutty talk while the younger men call for relief.'

Secret role: Isabel, not her real name, loves the fact nobody knows about her evening work for a sex line

Isabel said nobody knows her secret profession and her friends and family would be shocked if they knew how she's spending her evenings.

The single mother-of-one said she would consider giving up the job if she met a new man who didn't approve, but for now she is relishing her new role.

She said: 'I'm doing it for myself. I live alone and, like some of the men that call me, I'm lonely and want someone to talk to.

'It's escapism for me and I've found it very liberating and empowering.'

Isabel had been working as a highly paid executive in the field of marketing but gave up her role at the insistence of her husband who wanted her to have more time for the family. However, he then left her for a younger woman.

Isabel said it took her a long time to get back on her feet and working for the sex line has been one way of re-building her confidence and 'getting her own back on men.'

She said: 'I like the fact they don't know who I am and I can take on whatever character they want me to.'

She admitted after being married for years, she had led a 'sheltered life' but working for the sex line has 'opened her eyes.'

'Initially I was shocked by the language and sexual terms people use but it's opened my eyes and I take it all in my stride now,' she confessed.

However, she added it still never 'ceases to amaze' her what some people request when they ring.

Strange fetishes: Isabel said the requests she gets from callers never ceases to amaze her

She said: 'There is no script, I follow the lead of the people who call and what they want - which are sometimes things I could never have imagined. Smoking is one fetish that surprises me as some want me to pretend I'm blowing smoke in their faces.

'Others like financial things such as pretending I'm stealing money from their accounts. Domination is always a popular theme.'

Isabel spoke to the MailOnline on the condition of anonymity to celebrate the DVD release of 'For A Good Time Call', a film about two young women who start up a sex line business from their New York apartment to earn some extra cash.

Making money was also another of Isabel's incentives - although she admits the job isn't going to make her a millionaire.

'I do it part-time in the evenings for a couple of hours so I usually make Â£100 a week. I see it as a good opportunity for some extra money,' she said.

Isabel said she always feels completely safe as the callers have no idea who she is and there are strict guidelines on what she is allowed to talk about.

Giving any personal information on herself is forbidden while if a caller suggests anything illegal, such as involving animals or children, she immediately hangs up.

Isabel said while the job is out of her comfort zone and something she'd never imagined she would ever do, she's currently enjoying every minute.

'I like the fact I can live this fantasy life and nobody knows about it,' she said.

For a Good Time, Call is out on Blu-ray and DVD from 25th February
