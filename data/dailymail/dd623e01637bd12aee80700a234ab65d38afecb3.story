Shocking: Retired teacher Margaret Jones, 82, was found by her daughter in hospital covered in food

A retired teacher was found dehydrated and groping for food in hospital because nurses failed to realise she was virtually blind, her horrified daughter has said.

Good Hope Hospital in Sutton Coldfield, West Midlands, has apologised for 'fundamental failings' in its care of 82-year-old Margaret Jones after she was admitted following a fall in June. 

Staff were told the pensioner's eyes could only pick out light and dark after suffering almost total blindness triggered by arteriosclerosis, a hardening of the arteries which restricts blood flow.

But when her daughter Rosalind Waite-Jones re-visited her on June 27 - just ten days after she was admitted - she discovered her mother dishevelled, dehydrated and covered in food.

It was the result of Mrs Jones desperately groping for items she could not see.

'They have a red tray policy,' said Mrs Waite-Jones, 46. 'A red tray for those visually impaired. That was never implemented.

'We were horrified to see food and pots of medication left out of mum's reach.

'How medical professionals can fail to realise someone is virtually sightless simply beggars belief.'

On the same visit, said Mrs Waite-Jones, the whiteboard behind her mother's bed which should have shown details of her nurse was blank.

She has now raised the case with Sutton Coldfield MP Andrew Mitchell, who has also received a letter directly from the pensioners' nine-year-old granddaughter Florence.

'Grandma will never be the same and she used to do lovely things, like make jelly with us,' Florence told the MP. 'Some of the nurses have been very good but some of them were not.

'They forgot my grandma was blind, which wasn't very good, and made me and my sister Hope not very happy at all.

Desperation: The pensioner, who can only see shades of light and dark, with her head in her hands

'Worst of all, Hope and I haven't seen our grandma since July and that was just through a hospital window.'

Mr Mitchell has now pledged to investigate the case. 

Despite the horror discovery just ten days into her stay on the orthopaedic Ward 14, widow Mrs Jones spent another 62 days in hospital because she suffered an infection - which her daughter believes was septic shock.

She survived the life-threatening infection but it had a permanent effect on her brain function, and she can no longer recognise her family.

The 82-year-old entered the hospital 'coherent and alert' but is now confined to a nursing home for life.

Previously she had lived independently in an adapted home with talking clocks, coloured hobs and visits from helpers three times a day. 

Mrs Waite-Jones, who regularly makes the 350-mile round trip to see her mother from her home in Worthing, West Sussex, said: 'Her cognition has gone and that is the most distressing thing.

Complaint: The hospital in Sutton Coldfield, West Midlands, made a full apology after the family's complaint

'She doesn't recognise me now. Mum taught for a time in Liverpool and spends a lot of time believing she is still there.

'This is a woman who went on holiday with us in May. Yes, she was reliant on a Zimmer frame, but she had all her faculties.

'I firmly believe my mother is alive not because of the efforts of Ward 14, but because of family and friends who gave her food and fluids.

Holiday: Margaret Jones with her daughter Rosalind and granddaughters Florence and Hope

'She pulled through despite the care of Good Hope.'

The pensioner's daughter has a string of other complaints against the hospital, including that over-stretched staff described a shift as 'bonkers, manic and very stressful' on Facebook. 

She was also initially told her mother's infection was a sickness and diarrhoea bug, she added. Within days, Mrs Jones had deteriorated to the extent where she was classified as 'critically ill'.

Discharge papers wrongly referred to the pensioner as a stroke victim, and another letter received during the complaints process even described her as dead.

All this was despite Mrs Jones, who taught in schools in the Birmingham area for 40 years, having a good experience during a previous stay. 

'It has been a farce, an absolute farce,' said her daughter.

'Florence Nightingale famously said "the very first requirement in a hospital is that it should do the sick no harm". My mother is in a far, far worse state than when she went into Good Hope.'

Hospital staff have apologised for the care they gave to Mrs Jones. 

Unplanned Care general manager Karen Hope told her family in a letter: 'I would absolutely concur all the concerns you have raised are absolutely valid and the response you received initially was not acceptable in terms of actions and accountability.

'There are fundamental failings that, as a Trust, are being addressed and are ongoing.'

As a result of the case Good Hope will introduce a 'visually impaired' policy, the letter pledged. 

Richard Parker, the hospital's managing director, added: 'We are very sorry to learn of the concerns raised by Mrs Jones' family.

'We have offered a full apology because this is not the standard of care we expect for our patients.

Holiday: Mrs Jones with her granddaughters. Her last holiday was just a month before she was admitted

'We are sorry that Mrs Jones did not receive the highest standards of care in June when she was treated at Good Hope Hospital.

'We are keen to meet with family members to ensure that all of their issues are addressed and that we personally apologise for the poor care that Mrs Jones received.

'We have also taken steps to address the points raised so that we can improve the standards of care for all our patients.'

It comes less than a month after Heart of England NHS Foundation Trust, which runs the hospital, was named as one of the worst in the country for patient complaints.

Latest figures show that 5,518 patients waited more than the four-hour target at Heartlands, Good Hope and Solihull hospitals, which are all run by the Trust, compared to 1,619 in 2009-10 – an increase of 240 per cent.
