Christian Wade's latest scorching demonstration of predatory try-scoring reignited his England prospects on Sunday, but wasn’t quite enough to propel Wasps to a famous European victory.

Ultimately, Leinster asserted their status as an established force in continental competition by fighting back from a 20-11 deficit in this Pool Two clash to record a 26th win in their last 30 home matches at this exalted level and avoid a first defeat at the RDS Arena since 2009.

Yet, they were given an almighty scare by one of the Aviva Premiership’s rising clubs, as Wasps surged in front courtesy of Wade’s solo masterpiece.

Nothing was on, or so it seemed, when the ball came to the diminutive 23-year-old in the 34th minute. The visitors had a penalty advantage, so he just tried his luck and it paid off gloriously.

Wade darted to his right and swerved past the flailing Ian Madigan. That created the space, but he still had plenty to do.

Flicking on the turbo jets, he raced past Darragh Fanning down the flank and, as Zane Kirchner charged across to make a try-saving cover tackle, Wade leapt past him and kept his balance to touch down.

It was a staggering exhibition of finishing class and a very timely one, too. England head coach Stuart Lancaster and his assistants are announcing their squad for the autumn internationals on Wednesday and wing is an area of uncertainty.

Wade is among a clutch of contenders jostling for a place next month and this wonderful strike will have done him no harm, although any reservations about the uncapped Lion have always focused on his defending rather than attacking.

‘Christian has struggled with his confidence this season and he has struggled to get into games,’ said Dai Young, Wasps’ director of rugby.

‘But we all know he is capable of doing something special. He is always a threat and he has been getting better every game since he came back from injury. On the big stage, he can always do something like that and he also defended well today.’

While that will have come as good news for Lancaster and England as well as Wasps, less welcome was the sight of Joe Launchbury needing treatment near the end, after being tackled by Kane Douglas and Tadhg Furlong. The lock played on to the end, but he will be assessed by his club’s medical staff today.

‘Joe took a bit of a knock from the side on his knee,’ said Young. ‘The physios will have a look at him. I don’t expect it to be anything too serious, but we’ll have a look at it tomorrow.’

Before Wade’s dramatic intervention, Wasps had already seized the initiative in stirring fashion, despite Leinster’s early onslaught led by their barnstorming No 8 and captain, Jamie Heaslip.

Jimmy Gopperth’s early penalty put the hosts in front but Andy Goode responded with two shots of his own at the other end, before Young’s men claimed the game’s first try.

Leinster were moving forward with intent near halfway but Noel Reid’s pass was intercepted by Alapati Leiua and the centre burst clear to score by the posts. Goode added the routine conversion.

Stunned by that setback, Leinster responded promptly. Heaslip broke tackles by Launchbury and Elliot Daly on the left, then Gopperth sent a clever low kick towards the corner and Fanning chased through to score.

Wade’s try re-established Wasps’ advantage, with Goode adding the conversion from a tight angle, but a Madigan penalty just before the break gave Leinster momentum and they took charge after half-time, with the wind at their backs.

Devin Toner created a second try for Fanning by charging down Joe Simpson’s kick and driving deep into Wasps’ 22 seconds later, and the conversion by Madigan reduced the gap to two points.

The force was with the home side and hooker Sean Cronin blazed a trail through the visitors’ defence on the hour, to pave the way for Dominic Ryan to touch down the match- winning try. Again, Madigan added the extras and Leinster should have extended their lead in the closing stages, but Wasps hung on gamely to earn a backs-to-the-wall bonus point which may be decisive in a potentially close pool battle.

Wasps host Harlequins at Adams Park on Sunday and they are optimistic that captain James Haskell — who missed this game with flu — will be available again. They know they need to win that home tie to galvanise their European campaign, but Young was bullish after this game. ‘We’ve lost the battle today but we haven’t lost the war,’ he said.
