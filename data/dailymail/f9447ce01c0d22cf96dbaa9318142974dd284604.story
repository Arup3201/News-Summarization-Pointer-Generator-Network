A tiny Angolan colobus monkey born this month has made its debut at Brookfield Zoo, Illinois.

And mother five-year-old Olivia, is getting some maternal help from female monkey friends Chaka, aged four, and Tina, 17, who are pictured seemingly making a fuss of the new arrival.

Angolan colobuses allo-parent, meaning that other members in the group take turns carrying the baby, who goes back to its mother when she wants it back or when the baby needs to nurse.

Born on March 9, the tiny baby is the
first birth of this species at the zoo and can be seen at the Tropic 
attraction's World: Africa exhibit.

'We
are excited to be able to bring a new species of colobus to Brookfield 
Zoo for our guests to view,' said Jay Petersen, curator of mammals for 
the Society.

'Angolan colobuses are a very 
eye-catching species with their black body and face, long white hair 
extending from their shoulders, and a 25-inch black-and-white tail.'

Infants are born completely white, which is great camouflage as they blend in with their mother's long white hair.

As the young monkey develop, zoogoers will notice it begin to change colour from white to grey to black, reaching adult colouration at approximately three months of age.

Angolan colobuses are found in dense rain forests throughout equatorial Africa. These animals are the most arboreal of the African monkeys, spending most of their time in the canopy.

They have slender bodies and long tails with long, 
silky hair. They are black with a white brow band, cheeks, and throat.

The their tails can measure up to 32inches and they can weigh up to 25 lbs, with males slightly larger than females.

The species is threatened in parts of its range due to habitat destruction for timber and for agricultural use. In certain areas, such as the Congo Basin, people hunt them for meat.
