A Syrian mother and father rescued in the latest refugee boat tragedy have told how they saved their nine-month-old daughter but saw their son, three, drown.

The unnamed parents were aboard the vessel carrying more than 200 migrants fleeing Syria’s civil war to the Italian island of Lampedusa.

It capsized on Friday evening with the loss of at least 34 lives including six children and one newborn. Save the Children Italy spokesman Michele Prosperi said of the couple’s ordeal: ‘They stayed in the water for more than an hour.

'They were able to make this little girl safe by holding her out of the water while losing their son.

‘They were all trying to swim with each other, but the boy just couldn’t keep going.’

He added that the family were now being treated at a reception centre on the island.

The tragedy happened close to where more than 300 African migrants drowned when their boat went down just over a week ago.

The latest disaster was caused when passengers crowded to one side as they tried to get the attention of a helicopter.

Lampedusa, a tiny island midway between Sicily and Tunisia, is one of the main destinations for smugglers ferrying migrants to Europe.

They charge more than £850 a head and cram migrants on to boats that routinely run into trouble.

Joseph Muscat, Prime Minister of nearby Malta, said: ‘As things stand we are just building a cemetery within our Mediterranean sea.’

More than 50 survivors from the latest tragedy are now heading to Sicily on board an Italian frigate.
