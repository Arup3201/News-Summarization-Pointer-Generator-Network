The HMV brand has been rescued after administrators agreed a £50million deal which will save 2,500 jobs.

Hilco, a specialist restructuring firm, will acquire 141 HMV-branded stores - including 23 which had previously been set to close.

The iconic brand had faced disappearing from high streets altogether if a rescue deal could not be agreed.

Rescue package: The iconic HMV brand is set to be saved in a £50million deal which will preserve 2,500 jobs

Major music companies and film studios, 
keen to keep a major distribution channel, are 
understood to have agreed to new supply terms with HMV and have approved
the deal.

The buy out will involve the company emerging from administration, backed by a new company incorporated in the UK.

The chain is expected to be run by HMV executives together with newly-appointed figures from Hilco.

HMV called in administrators from Deloitte in January but hopes of a rescue deal were subsequently raised after Hilco bought the company's £176million of debt for a reported £40million.

It was announced in February that 66 of HMV's 220 shops would close over two months, at the cost of nearly 1,000 jobs.

Declining sales: HMV went into administration in January as it battled against declining sales of CDs and DVDs as well as competition from supermarkets and online retailers

HMV had 223 stores across the UK, 
employing 4,123 staff, when weak consumer spending and intense 
competition from the internet and supermarkets forced it into 
administration in January.

Hilco dhief executive Paul McGowan said the group spent weeks discussing
fresh terms with landlords and suppliers, which all supported its plans
to keep the chain on the high street. The long-awaited deal includes 
nine Fopp stores.

Hilco plans to replicate some of the 
success it has had with HMV in Canada, which it bought almost two years 
ago and is now 'trading strongly'.

Mr McGowan said: 'The structural 
differences in the markets and the higher level of competition in the UK
will prove additional challenges for the UK business but we believe it 
has a successful future ahead of it.'

Hilco will reverse plans to sell 
tablets and other devices in stores and 'reclaim the space for an 
enhanced music and visual range'.

Iconic: The classic HMV logo with Nipper the dog which is familiar on Britain's high streets

A rescue for HMV, whose Nipper the Dog trademark is a familiar logo on the British high street, would be a timely boost for retailers as pressure on consumer spending and a shifting trend to shopping online hit businesses hard.

Along with Woolworths and JJB Sports, well-known firms like MFI and Comet have also fallen by the wayside in recent years.

English composer Edward Elgar opened the first HMV store on London's Oxford Street in 1921.

But after 92 years they were facing closure after struggling with declining CD, DVD and video game markets as well as fierce supermarket and online competition.

Entertainment retailer HMV has been bought by restructuring group Hilco in a deal that saves more than 2,500 jobs and keeps 141 stores open. It also includes nine Fopp stores.

The full list of stores is:

Aberdeen, Ayr, Banbury, Bangor, Basildon, Basingstoke, Bath, Belfast Donegall Arcade, Birmingham Bullring, Blackpool, Bluewater, Bournemouth, Bradford, Brighton Churchill, Bristol Broadmead, Bristol Cribbs, Bromley, Bury, Bury St Edmunds, Cambridge, Canary Wharf, Canterbury, Cardiff, Carlisle, Chelmsford, Cheltenham, Chester, Chichester, Colchester, Coventry, Crawley, Cwmbran, Darlington, Derby, Doncaster, Dundee, East Kilbride, Eastbourne, Edinburgh Fort Retail, Edinburgh Ocean Terminal, Edinburgh Princes Street, Exeter, Bristol (Fopp), Cambridge (Fopp), Covent Garden (Fopp), Edinburgh (Fopp), Glasgow Byres Road (Fopp), Glasgow Union Street (Fopp), Gower Street London (Fopp), Manchester (Fopp), Nottingham (Fopp), Gateshead, Glasgow Argyle, Glasgow Buchanan, Glasgow Fort, Gloucester, Grimsby, Guernsey, Guildford, Hanley, Harlow, Harrogate, Hastings, Hatfield, Hereford, High Wycombe, Horsham, Hull, Inverness, Ipswich, Isle of Man, Isle of Wight, Islington, Jersey, Kettering, Kings Lynn, Kingston, Leamington Spa, Leeds Headrow, Leeds White Rose, Leicester, Lincoln, Liverpool One, Livingston, Llandudno, Maidstone, Manchester 90 Market Street, Manchester Trafford, Mansfield, Merry Hill, Middlesbrough, Milton Keynes, Newcastle, Newport (Wales), Northampton, Norwich Gentlemans Walk, Norwich Chapelfield, Nottingham Victoria, Nuneaton, Oxford, Oxford Circus, Peterborough Queensgate, Plymouth Drake Circus, Poole, Portsmouth Commercial Road, Portsmouth Gun Wharf Quay, Preston, Reading Oracle, Romford, Selfridges Oxford Street, Sheffield High Street, Sheffield Meadowhall, Shrewsbury, Solihull, Southampton, Southend Victoria, Southport, Speke Park, Staines, Stevenage, Stirling, Stockport, Stratford upon Avon, Stratford City Westfield, Sunderland, Sutton, Swansea, Taunton, Thanet, Thurrock, Truro, Tunbridge Wells, Uxbridge, Westfield London, Wimbledon, Winchester, Wolverhampton, Worcester, Worthing, Yeovil, York.
