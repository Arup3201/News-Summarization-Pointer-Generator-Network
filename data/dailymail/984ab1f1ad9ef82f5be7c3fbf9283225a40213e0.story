Former Manchester City striker Emmanuel Adebayor once told Roberto Mancini to look his name up on the internet after the Italian claimed his scoring rate was not good enough.

Adebayor, speaking in an exclusive interview with Fabrice Muamba in the Daily Express, told the former City boss during his time at the Etihad Stadium that he must have been talking about a different player.

My man: Adebayor said Mancini wanted Balotelli as his striker rather than the Togo international

The Togolese striker told Mancini to Google him and look at his goal record in the Premier League before making such an accusation.

He said: 'Mancini always had his way and then whenever he went into the club he was like: "I don't want you. I want Mario Balotelli to come and play for me because your scoring rate is not that good."

'I thought, okay, maybe you are talking about another Adebayor. I told him to go on the internet.

'I said: "Okay, if that's the case, just Google me. Go on the internet.

'Google me and see what I have done in this league.'
