In the grip of two burly policemen, the fugitive prisoner known as the Skull Cracker is escorted into court in handcuffs yesterday.

Michael Wheatley was flanked by another two officers in stab vests as he was led in to face a charge of carrying out an armed robbery during four days on the run from prison.

Guards took the unusual step of handcuffing Wheatley, 55, in the dock.

 in Tower Hamlets, east London at 2pm on Wednesday, just hours after the

Wheatley, who vanished as he was being
 prepared for release from prison, is said to have grabbed a bag of cash
 during the raid on the building society on Wednesday at 10.20am, before
 smashing the back door to escape.

He
 was arrested less than four hours later in Bow, East London. Kevin 
Perry, Wheatley’s alleged accomplice, was also arrested and appeared at 
the same court yesterday.

Perry,
 53, of East London, is accused of perverting the course of justice by 
giving Wheatley a place to stay, handling cash stolen from Chelsea 
Building Society and assisting an offender by getting rid of a hat and 
jacket allegedly worn by Wheatley during the raid.

Both men were remanded in custody to Guildford Crown Court on May 29.
