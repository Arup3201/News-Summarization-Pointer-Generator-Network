A married California district attorney has been accused of burning down the home of a former prostitute who was allegedly his mistress after he discovered she was seeing other men.

Sutter County prosecutor Carl Adams, a father-of-three, is being questioned in the arson investigation after racy messages he sent to Sarah Garibay suggested jealously was a possible motive, detectives said.

In court documents, Garibay, 32, admits she was having an affair with three men at once, including Adams. Police said when Adams found out about his love rivals, he was not happy and made this clear to the mother-of-three.

'Adams has told her how he is jealous. She showed us text messages where he stated he was jealous,' detectives wrote in the police report.

The report, obtained by CBS13, also states Adams showed up at the crime scene on July 21, just hours after the fire and spoke with neighbors.

Police interviewed Adams, and the other two men, about the fire and his relationship with Garibay after determining the men each 'had reason to be upset with her.'

'I asked Adams if he was in a sexual relationship with Sarah Garibay and he said no,' an officer wrote in the affidavit.

'When confronted with Garibay's statement and phone records, Adams admitted he was having an affair with Garibay.'

Adams told Foxnews.com in an email: 'The 
personal part of this is just that - personal, and will be resolved with
my wife, my pastor and God.'

But he denies any involvement in the fire.

'I
had nothing to do with the arson. I am now allowing the Yuba City 
Police Department's investigation to run its course,' he told CBS.

Police said one of the three men originally named in the affidavit - Amerjit Bhatti, who has a 14-month-old daughter with Garibay - has been cleared as a suspect but Adams and a third man, identified as Ronnie Johnson, have not.

However, neither has been charged with any crime at this stage.

Adams knew the cause and origin of the blaze though it wasn't clear how, police said, raising suspicions.

Garibay wasn't home at the time of the fire.

Her attorney, Roberto Marquez, told FoxNews.com his client was shocked and upset that Adams has been connected to the arson.

'Never
once did she list him as a potential suspect,' Marquez said on Tuesday.
'She's upset and saddened that he is being dragged through the mud and 
seeing his reputation being sullied.'

She told the Appeal-Democrat newspaper earlier this week: 'Someone is trying to smear him and they're using my name to do it.'

Debbie Myers, who lives next door to the fire said she spoke to Adams after it happened.

'I never met him before until the morning of the fire,' she told CBS News. 'I didn't know it was him. I didn't know who he was. He just said he was a friend of the family and he'd helped them out with a lot of stuff.'

Adams told police he went to Garibay's home after the fire because 'the victim called and asked for my help,' according to KCRA.

Adams has been the county's district attorney since 1982 and is the president of the California District Attorney's Association.

Garibay was arrested last week on charges of extortion, according to Fox News.

In 2010, she was charged as an accessory in the death of her then-boyfriend, Dr. Hyo Deoung Shin, after another man she was having an affair with, Jeffrey Wayne Clay, caught the couple in bed.

Garibary received immunity from Adams' office in exchange for her testimony and cooperation with authorities but she insists he pair had no relationship back then.
