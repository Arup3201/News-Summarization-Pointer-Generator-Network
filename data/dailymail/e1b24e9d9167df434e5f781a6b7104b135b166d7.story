Britain's longest-serving soap actor used his fame to sexually assault starstruck girls after inviting them to his Coronation Street dressing room, a court heard yesterday.

William Roache, 81, who has played Ken Barlow on ITV for five decades, preyed on fans in the 1960s, confident his celebrity status meant they would not complain, it was claimed.

One 14-year-old was attending a talent contest when Roache led her into the men’s toilet and made her perform a sex act on him, Preston Crown Court was told. He later wrote her a letter enclosing a signed photograph to secure her loyalty.

But following the exposure of serial 
sex offender Jimmy Savile in 2012, a jury heard that five women, who 
were aged between 12 and 16 at the time of the alleged offences, finally
 felt confident enough to come forward.

‘You
 may well conclude by the end of this trial that William Roache’s fame 
and popularity provided not only the opportunity for his offending but 
that it is one of the predominant reasons for his victims’ decades of 
silence,’ prosecutor Anne Whyte, QC, told the jury.

The
 twice-married father-of-four went on trial yesterday accused of twice 
raping a 15-year-old girl who lived close to his then home in 
Lancashire.

In addition, he is accused of indecently assaulting four young girls he met at Granada Studios in Manchester.

Another
 said Roache pushed his hands up her jumper, while two sisters – one as 
young as 11 or 12 – who were invited into his dressing room, and given 
lifts in his silver Rolls-Royce, claimed they were also sexually 
assaulted.

Immaculately 
dressed in a dark blue three-piece suit and striped tie and with his 
grey hair neatly trimmed, the widower arrived at court flanked by 
his 49-year-old son, Linus, and his two children by his late 
second wife Sara – 32-year-old Verity and her brother James, 28.

Famous: Roache, pictured with youngest daughter Verity, is probably Britain's best known soap star, and the jury were asked to ignore what they know about his character Ken Barlow

At
 the start of the trial, the judge, Mr Justice Holroyde, told jurors 
they were likely to be familiar with Ken Barlow from television but must
 distinguish between the character and the actor. Witnesses will include
 fellow cast members Anne Kirkbride, who plays his on-screen wife 
Deirdre, Chris Gascoyne, who plays his son Peter, and Helen Worth, who 
plays Gail Platt, later Gail Tilsley.

The
 actor first attacked a 14-year-old who was attending a talent contest 
at Granada Studios in 1965 and was invited to a dressing room by Roache 
and other cast members, said Miss Whyte.

She
 alleged Roache – then 33 – led her into the men’s toilet and, without 
speaking, made her perform a sex act on him before they returned to the 
dressing room.

He asked for the schoolgirl’s address and later sent her a letter and a signed photograph which she still has, the court heard.

Later
 that year, she claims Roache gave her a lift in his car where she 
‘believes’ another sex act took place. The same year, a 16-year-old girl
 was at Granada Studios when Roache approached her in the ladies’ 
toilets and started to ‘fondle’ her breast, Miss Whyte said.

In
 1967, the court heard, a 15-year-old girl who lived near Roache’s then 
home was led by the actor into the bungalow he shared with first wife 
Anna Cropper, forced on to a double bed and raped.

Later that year, she agreed to go into a cottage he owned and once inside he allegedly raped her again.

The
 15-year-old alleged rape victim was a virgin and told police she felt 
‘panic-stricken’ at Roache’s actions, which came with no attempts to 
‘kiss or sweet talk her’.

Then
 between 1968 and 1971, Roache allegedly groomed the two sisters 
initially aged around 12 and 14 who would wait outside the studios.

The
 elder sister claims that one day Roache – still wearing make-up and 
stage clothes from playing Ken Barlow – invited her into his dressing 
room and without warning put his hand up her skirt.

On
 the same occasion, the jury was told actor Neville Buswell, who played 
Ray Langton, asked the younger sister to touch him sexually, but she 
refused. He has denied these claims.

Later,
 Roache allegedly gave the younger sister, now 57, and a friend a lift 
in his silver Rolls-Royce Silver Cloud and made her perform a sex act on
 him.

At one point, she told police, she stopped when a double-decker 
bus drove past, but he replaced her hand and made her continue, later 
giving her half a crown to get a bus home as he dropped them off.

Miss 
Whyte said all five kept quiet until an interview Roache gave to New 
Zealand television in March last year. The husband of the younger sister
 interpreted  comments Roache made in the interview as suggesting that 
‘in the old days young girls were throwing themselves at him and they 
were all sexually active’.

Allegations: The actor allegedly attacked two of the young girls in the toilets at Granada Studios in Manchester, the court heard

Attacks: The prosecution say the star enjoyed attacking girls ins in a risky place, 'using his position and fame to try and obtain a continuation of sexual gratification'

Entrance: The star's security were forced to clear path through a crowd as he arrived at Preston Crown Court this morning

Arrival: Coronation Street Star Bill Roache walks to Preston Crown Court with children Linus (behind left), James (next left) and Verity (right) for the start of his trial, where he is accused of historical sexual offences

Support: Roache - who has played Ken Barlow for decades - arrived flanked by his security in front and his children behind

Roache’s comments ‘grated’ and he contacted a Sunday newspaper with a view to selling her story, the court heard.

Meanwhile
 the alleged rape victim contacted police that month after a 
conversation in which her grown-up son expressed disbelief about victims
 of Savile and former MP Cyril Smith taking so long to come forward, 
Miss Whyte said.

She told 
him Roache had raped her as a schoolgirl and, at his insistence, she 
formally reported it to police.

Roache was arrested and charged with two
 counts of rape, and following publicity over his court appearance the 
other four alleged victims contacted police.

'The youngest told police 
she had felt ‘intimidated’ because people ‘feel he is some kind of super
 actor and they think he’s lovely and always “William Roache what a good
 man he is”, you know, you don’t stand a chance if you went forward’.

Roache,
 who was arrested last May, denies any sexual contact with the girls, 
telling police he had slept with many women but always with consent and 
none was underage.

On screen: The actor's on screen wife, Deidre, played by Anne Kirkbride, will give evidence during the four week trial, the court heard

However 
Miss Whyte said the jury may be struck by the fact that while the women 
did not know each other – apart from the sisters – they gave strikingly 
similar accounts.

Roache, of
 Wilmslow, Cheshire, who has not appeared on Coronation Street since he 
was charged, denies five counts of indecent assault and two of rape 
involving five girls then aged between 12 and 16.

The trial continues.
