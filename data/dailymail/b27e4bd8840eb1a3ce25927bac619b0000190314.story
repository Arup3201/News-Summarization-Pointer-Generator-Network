Rob Gronkowski enjoyed a fruitful return to Arizona, scoring a touchdown to help the New England Patriots to victory in Super Bowl XLIX.

After losing the last time New England reached the season decider, the 25-year-old tight end tasted victory in the most dramatic Super Bowl in recent memory.

‘I’m excited. With that interception and you’re nervous, you don’t know what you’re thinking.

Just get prepared for the final drive. Just a few seconds left. I was preparing for it. Butler made that huge play - props to him.

‘He works hard. He’s an unbelievable player. He made the play of the century, no doubt.’

But for fate’s fickle finger, that title could well have gone to Seattle Seahawks receiver Jermaine Kearse, who had juggled Russell Wilson’s prayer, catching it at the fourth attempt to put Seattle deep in Patriots territory.

‘It was surreal that that even happened. I was like, man they’ve got about a minute left and they just made a 50-yard bomb. We thought the ball hit the ground.

‘When we saw it happen, we just got up as an offense and was just getting ready to have a drive just in case they scored. They didn’t and the game ended. Unbelievable.’

Meanwhile, a downbeat Kearse reflected on the catch, saying: 'I was just trying to make a play for my team. I just got an opportunity and [Russell Wilson] gave me a chance. However I could come down with the ball, I was going to try.

Asked if it was the craziest catch of his career, he replied: 'It was probably the most interesting, but it doesn't really matter right now anymore.'
