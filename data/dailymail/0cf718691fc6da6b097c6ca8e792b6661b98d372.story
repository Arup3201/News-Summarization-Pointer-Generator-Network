A bar in Bolton has renewed its claim to be 'Britain's most haunted pub' after new footage emerged of a 'ghost' appearing at an upstairs window.

Tony Dooley, who runs Ye Olde Man and Scythe in Greater Manchester, feared his premises were haunted earlier this year when CCTV appeared to show a ghostly figure standing at his bar during the night.

He now says he's been left in no doubt that there are ghosts in the pub after  another video, apparently shot by a tourist, emerged showing a second apparition.

Ye Olde Man and Scythe in Bolton has appeared in a second spooky video after a tourist  filmed a strange flickering light in an upstairs window of the centuries-old tavern

The latest video is believed to have been filmed by a Portuguese visitor to the area who was talking about the original incident, which happened at the 763-year-old pub earlier this year.

As he describes the pub's 'haunted' history, a strange flickering light appears at an upstairs window.

Manager Mr Dooley, 36, says the footage has left him certain that he is living among ghosts.

He said: 'I'm not too happy about it. That's my flat behind the window. My attitude before I became the manager nine months ago was not to believe in ghosts. I'm convinced now.'

He also claims that, a few weeks ago, he was woken by what he thought was his partner's pet dog, Kallie, licking his feet, but he looked over to discover the animal was asleep.

He added: 'My feet were clammy and wet, like sweaty palms only worse. I went straight to the bathroom and took a shower with the dog in the room making sure nothing else happened.'

He said: 'It was creepy, but my attitude is as long the ghost doesn't harm me then that's fine.'

In February, Mr Dooley investigated smashing glass in the bar area overnight and saw a 'figure' appear on CCTV footage.

It is claimed the pub, the fourth-oldest in Britain, is haunted by the ghost of James Stanley, the seventh Earl of Derby and royalist.

It is believed he spent the last hours of his life at the inn before he was beheaded in 1651 in the final months of the English Civil War.

Hundreds of soldiers and civilians were also killed outside the pub, which dates from 1251, during the Bolton Massacre in 1644.
