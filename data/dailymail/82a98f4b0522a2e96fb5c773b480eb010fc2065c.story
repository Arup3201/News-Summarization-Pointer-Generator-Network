Harry Kane and Aaron Lennon were on target as Tottenham completed their pre-season tour of North American with a comfortable win over Chicago Fire.

After a draw with the Seattle Sounders and back-to-back wins against Toronto FC and now Chicago, Mauricio Pochettino can be satisfied with the results on their trip.

The players struck at the start and end of an entertaining clash at Toyota Park, with Kane opening the scoring after just five minutes.

Lewis Holtby stole possession from 
Fire captain Jeff Larentowicz to find himself clean through on goal but 
unselfishly squared for Kane to finish.

Erik
 Lamela, who was impressive once again after scoring twice against 
Toronto on Wednesday, twice tested Fire goalkeeper Sean Johnson in an 
open first-half.

The Argentinean beat two defenders and played a tidy one-two with Andros Townsend before seeing his powerful effort saved.

The MLS outfit posed the occasional threat going forward and Brad Friedel saved from Matt Watson's 25-yard effort.

Both
 teams made wholesale changes at half-time and by the 55th minute, Fire 
had a completely different team on the field from the starting line-up.

Spurs
 substitute Ben Davies fired high and wide after Ryan Mason had played 
him in to a shooting position, while Lennon underhit his volley when 
Christian Eriksen teed him up.

And with 15 minutes left, Iago Falque played in Roberto Soldado, only for defender Greg Cochrane to block his goal-bound shot.

Falling into place: Mauricio Pochettino's team have remained unbeaten on their tour of the United States

Leap of faith: Aaron Lennon tries to get the better of Fire goalkeeper Kyle Reynish

However, Tottenham didn't have to wait much longer to score their second and settle the contest.

Soldado
 played a lovely ball over the top into Lennon's path and the winger 
beat Jhon Kennedy Hurtado to the ball before beating goalkeeper Kyle 
Reynish.

Spurs searched for
 a third but Reynish was quicker off his line to thwart Eriksen and 
Bakary Soumare blocked a header from Soldado in stoppage time.

Pochettino
 now takes his team to Helsinki for a friendly with Celtic on Saturday, 
before they welcome Schalke to White Hart Lane on August 9.
