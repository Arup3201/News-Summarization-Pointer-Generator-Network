Lord Chief Justice Lord Thomas, the most senior judge in the country, said many judges felt under paid

Half of all Appeal Court judges think they don’t earn enough – despite getting £200,661 a year- according to a new survey.

And when it comes to High Court judges, four in five are unhappy with their £176,226 salary while the same proportion of Circuit judges, who get £130,875 a year, also felt hard done by. In comparison, the Prime Minister’s salary is £142,500.

Nearly nine in ten of all judges in England and Wales responded to the latest job satisfaction survey. Most said their salary and pensions did ‘not adequately reflect the work I do’.

Fewer than half (49 per cent) thought their work was valued by the public. And just two per cent said they felt valued by the Government.

The grumbling follows a series of pay freezes and a long-running spat over Coalition attempts to rein back judges’ generous pension scheme.

The poll was carried out at the suggestion of the Senior Salaries Review Body, which advises the Government on pay levels in the public sector.

Most respondents also felt there is declining respect for them and that their working conditions are getting worse.

While almost every judge consulted in the survey complained that his or her computer was inadequate.

Lord Chief Justice Lord Thomas, the most senior judge in the country, said: ‘The survey shows that many judges are feeling, in common with millions of other people, that their work has become harder year after year in many ways.

'Even though they know they are well paid compared to most people, they, like many others, have seen their pay drop in real terms.’

‘The survey also shows that judges do not carry out the work solely for the money. Their work is rewarding, but also demanding - confronting significant human suffering, loss and family breakdowns or untangling business transactions with livelihoods and businesses at stake.

Unhappy: An officially-organised survey found that most judges felt their salaries did nto reflect the work they did

'Judges are dedicated to their role, working harder and longer to keep standards high.’

He added: ‘Investment which has been promised to give judges modern IT will help.’ 

Traditionally, judges have always earned high salaries – partly to lessen the risk of bribery and corruption, and partly to encourage good-quality lawyers to leave highly-paid jobs as advocates in the courts.
