Force India and Sauber have vowed to resist what they believe is the 'game plan' for Formula One over the years to come.

This weekend's Abu Dhabi Grand Prix may represent the title decider between Mercedes duo Lewis Hamilton and Nico Rosberg, but off track there is far more at stake.

For the third successive race weekend, F1 supremo Bernie Ecclestone is to sit down with the trio of smaller marques pleading for change within the sport.

Ecclestone has already rejected out of hand their demands for a more equitable distribution of income, with the 'big four' - Ferrari, Red Bull, Mercedes and McLaren - claiming half of last year's £530million revenues.

Sauber team principal Monisha Kaltenborn and Force India deputy team principal Bob Fernley have already suggested 'an agenda' is being set whereby the smaller teams are to be driven out of the sport.

Fernley, however, insists his team are ready to dig their heels in and fight tooth and nail against the potential introduction of third cars, and eventually customer cars.

'You've got to interpret from the evidence that (an agenda) is a given,' Fernley said.

'Clearly it's indicating in that direction. We know what the desired outcome is. It doesn't necessarily mean getting rid of us - it could mean converting us to customer teams.

Mercedes are one of four teams to have claimed half of last year's £530million in revenues made by F1

'But one way or another it is probably trying not to keep the status quo. Where we have the full constructors' series, it is to break us up.

'The clear direction we are getting is there is a desire to have five constructor teams and five customer teams, which will be the best way they feel to go.'

But a resolute Fernley added: 'From our point of view, we can now focus on strengthening our status as a constructor, and we will do.

'Now we know what the game plan is, and the last few weeks have exposed it, we can work with it.

'We just want to make sure we stay a constructor, and we will work hard to do that and stay competitive.

'What has happened certainly makes Vijay (Mallya, co-owner) very, very strong.'

Sauber have been racing in the sport since 1993 but could be forced out due to the financial spat

Kaltenborn, whose team are poised to the end the season without a point to their name for the first time in their history, is also of the same firm mind as Fernley.

'We have been in this sport since 1993,' she said.

'Force India have been around a while, Lotus as well. How can you just drive out people like this? It's just not right.

'The big teams use F1 as a simple sporting, marketing platform. It's nothing more for them.

'They talk of it as being a sport, of fairness and all that stuff, but where is that now?

'Years ago we had a situation with another team that now is the world champion, and all the teams got together.

'We are not out here with, as they are saying, a begging bowl, but we are part of the show.

'It's very disrespectful to behave this way towards other teams within the sport, and even more disrespectful towards the fans.'

Lotus is another of those teams who's future is uncertain at the moment in F1
