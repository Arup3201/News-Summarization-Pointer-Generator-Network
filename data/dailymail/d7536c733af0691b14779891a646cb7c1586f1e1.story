Nigella Lawson's admission that she took cocaine and smoked cannabis is unlikely to damage her career and may even give it a boost, PR experts have claimed.

The TV chef is currently trying to crack the lucrative American market with a second series of her show The Taste due to start airing next month.

Earlier attempts by Lawson to make a name for herself in U.S. have failed, and while some experts say the controversy will have damaged her reputation beyond repair, others argue she will bounce back.

Brave face: TV chef Nigella Lawson will bounce back from revelations that she took drug, say PR experts

The revelations that she has used illegal 
drugs have emerged as part of the fraud trial of her two personal assistants
 at Isleworth Crown court.

In a scathing email, ex husband Charles Saatchi accused her of being 'so off your head on drugs' that she had allowed the PAs to spend 'whatever they liked'.

Yesterday, in a dramatic courtroom confession, Lawson admitted to having snorted cocaine and having smoked cannabis in front of her children.

But she denied being an addict claiming said she needed the drugs to cope with the death of her first husband, John Diamond, and the ‘intimate terrorism’ of her second, Charles Saatchi.

Lawson appears to have garnered a great deal of sympathy owing to the nature of her marriage breakdown, in which she has been portrayed as the victim and Saatchi as something of a bully.

Saatchi received a police caution after pictures of him grabbing his clearly distressed wife by the throat during a restaurant lunch were published in the press.

After the drugs allegations were raised last month, one expert was quoted as saying: ‘If these allegations are proven and substantiated, then her career on American TV is over.’

But some U.S. commentators have pointed to the fact that Lawson's co-host on the Taste, the chef Anthony Bourdain has admitted 
having been a habitual drug user himself, before going on to become a successful TV star.

Bourdain was one of the many famous names to have tweeted messages in support of Lawson, using the hashtag #TeamNigella.

The Taste has been commissioned by 
Channel 4, which said filming for the ten-episode series had 
finished and will be screened in Britain early next year as planned.

PR guru Mark Borkowski, compared Nigella to the likes of Kate Moss, BP, Ryan Air and Elton John,  'brands', which have successfully bounced back from adverse publicity.

Writing in his personal blog he said: 'Post crisis the beleaguered brand with the best story will recover more quickly.

'Brands and individuals may well suffer slights and injuries, but with a brilliant team, smarter thinking, resilient strategy, perspective and intuitive creativity they can rise from yesterday’s newspaper with a stronger narrative and a much brighter, sounder future.'

Lawson, who is often described as something of a domestic goddess, is currently represented by  
Mark Hutchinson PR who also manages authors J K Rowling and Booker Prize Winner Andrea Levy.

She received a huge amount of support after allegations of her drug-taking first emerged with thousands taking to Twitter to voice their support.

They were rewarded with a ‘Holiday 
Hotcake’ recipe, from Lawson who said she wanted to ‘show thanks for all
 your support & to those who hashtag teamNigella’.

Sales of Lawson's latest cookbook Nigellissima have actually increased since October, however this has been put down to the fact that BBC 2 has aired a tie-in show in Northern Ireland.

Jon Howells, a spokesman for Waterstones, told the Times: 'She's one of our most loved cookery writers. I've no doubt that when she brings another book out it will be a best seller'.

Terence Fane-Saunders, chief executive London-based PR firm Chelgate, told Time magazine that Lawson should 'do what other reformed drug users have done in the past and insist that it’s behind her.

'There are a lot of distinguished people out there who’ve made similar admissions and have been able to go forward with their career.'
