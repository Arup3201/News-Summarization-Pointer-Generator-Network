A pilot managed to parachute to safety and land on a roof as his glider nose-dived into a field following a dramatic mid-air collision at 3,000ft.

Onlookers said they saw the aircraft 'corkscrew' out of the sky, tumbling into a field after it struck another glider in the skies above the village of Great Gransden, Cambridgeshire.

Fortunately the pilot managed to bail out of the falling glider and activate his parachute before he touched down on the roof of a farm outbuilding.

He unhooked his canopy and climbed down and walked away unhurt.

The second glider, which had been flying with a pilot and passenger, remained in the air and they safely returned to nearby Gransden Airfield where two planes had deparetd from.

Eyewitness Adrian Penrose said: 'I was out in the garden enjoying the sun when I heard a strange noise.

'I looked up and saw this glider corkscrewing straight down - I couldn’t believe it.

Landing: After landing on the roof the pilot was able to detach from his parachute and walk away from the farm building unharmed

'It landed in a field and apparently gave a woman riding her horse quite a fright.

'I was so relieved when I saw the pilot’s parachute. It’s just so lucky that nobody was hurt.'

The crashed glider landed around 200 yards away from buildings in Great Gransden.

A spokeswoman from Cambridge Gliding Club said: 'At 13.35 on Sunday two gliders collided near Gransden Airfield.

The Air Accident Investigation Branch has confirmed it is investigating the crash.
