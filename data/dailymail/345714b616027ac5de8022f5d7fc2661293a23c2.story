One of the founder members of a heritage steam railway has been honoured by having his coffin carried down the line ahead of his funeral service.

The coffin carrying Bernard Holden travelled nine miles on the Bluebell Railway from Sheffield Park to Kingscote in East Sussex today following his death on October 4 aged 104.

His bowler hat and medals, including the Burma Star and his MBE for services to steam preservation from 1992, topped his coffin, which was draped with the flag of the Royal Engineers.

Four uniformed pall-bearers representing different departments of the Bluebell Railway carried his coffin into the brake van as friends and relatives looked on from the platform.

Bluebell Railway spokeswoman Avril Gaynor said: 'The Bluebell Railway wouldn’t be here if it wasn’t for Bernard.

'He was always very positive and strong and very willing to help younger people. He was always very energetic and kept us going.'

His final journey on a Southwestern coach, one of the first coaches at the Bluebell Railway, followed a lifetime devoted to railways. He held numerous roles, including as a manager with the Southern and British Railways.

He chaired the first meeting of the Bluebell Railway Preservation Society after British Rail closed the Lewes-East Grinstead route in 1958. Latterly, he became the society’s president.

Dubbed the 'founding father' of the Bluebell Railway, Mr Holden saw it steadily expand to what it has become today - a preserved steam railway attraction which draws 170,000 visitors a year.

He was born in the station house at Barcombe in 1908 and his father Charles was the stationmaster. He worked at Southern Railway in 1925 as a ballast train clerk and studied signalling and transport law.

During the war he controlled trains bringing home evacuees from Dunkirk and plotted routes for trains round the bomb craters during the Blitz.

Full steam ahead: Bluebell Railway spokeswoman Avril Gaynor said: 'The Bluebell Railway wouldn't be here if it wasn't for Bernard.'

Mr Holden’s long-held dream of seeing 
the Bluebell line reconnected with the main line at East Grinstead, West
Sussex, is set to come to fruition next year

The Bluebell Railway now has a turnover of more than £3 million, full-time staff, 700 volunteers, three Victorian stations and a collection of locomotives, carriages and wagons.

Mr Holden’s long-held dream of seeing the Bluebell line reconnected with the main line at East Grinstead, West Sussex, is set to come to fruition next year.

Ms Gaynor said: 'Our only sadness is that he didn’t see us going into East Grinstead.'

The final journey was being followed by a funeral service at Ditchling. Donations which will go towards the line extension can be made to the Bluebell Railway at Sheffield Park.

The Lewes and East Grinstead Railway Act, 1877, which was promoted by the Earl of Sheffield and other local landowners, authorised the construction of a railway between the towns, and the 1878 Act provided for the acquisition, completion and running of the new line by the London Brighton and South Coast Company.

Of the sites chosen for the six stations, only one, Barcombe, was close to an existing village. Of the other five, all of which were in thinly populated areas, two were in the parish of Chailey and were placed near the homes of the line's promoters.

The line was opened in 1882 and carried passengers and goods, including milk, farm produce, coal and timber. British Railways submitted a proposal to close the line in 1954, but this was hotly contested by local residents.

The closure was approved in February 1955 and became effective from May 28th 1955.

But this sparked a four year battle between British Railways and the users of the line and that's when it became known as the Bluebell Line.  In 1877 local resident Miss Bessemer discovered that the 1878 Act had a clause and immediately requested British Railways to honour their obligation.

It was re-opened on 7th August 1956 and British Railways were severely criticised following a public inquiry.

However, Parliament then repealed the special section of the Act which had caused the problems and the line was finally closed on March 17 1958.

It was later taken over by the Bluebell Railway Preservation Society and re-opened on August 7 1960. It was the first 
preserved standard gauge steam-operated passenger railway in the world 
to operate a public service.

The Bluebell Railway is now a heritage 
line running for nine miles along the border between East and West 
Sussex. Steam trains are operated between Sheffield Park and Kingscote, 
with an intermediate station at Horsted Keynes.

It is managed and run largely by 
volunteers and has more than 30 steam locomotives the largest number in 
the UK after the National Railway Museum.

Work to extend the line by two miles to allow trains to go to East Grinstead began more than three years ago and thousands of tonnes of household waste had to be removed from part of 
the line at Imberhorne cutting at a cost of £2m, as it had been used as a
landfill site. The project has cost more than £4m in total.
