A cathedral organist who has been embroiled in a string of sex scandals has been jailed for sexually abusing a teenage pupil.

Ian Ball, 46, has had a series of inappropriate relationships and once had a pint poured over his head by a married lover’s husband.

But the Oxford graduate has now been jailed for two-and-a-half years for molesting a 14-year-old boy who visited his cathedral for organ lessons.

He was also found to have dozens of illegal images of children on his home computer.

Ball was forced to resign from his position at Gloucester Cathedral in 2002 after he admitted acting “inappropriately” with a 17-year-old sixth former.

He had previously had an affair with choir member Ruth Harper, which was made public after her ex-husband threw a pint over Ball’s head in a local pub.

The father-of-two was also investigated in connection with allegations involving a relationship with a male minor; however police took no further action.

But Ball has now been put behind bars for two-and-a-half years after it was revealed he sexually assaulted a teenage boy at a different cathedral. 

Ball, who now lives in Worcester, pleaded guilty to four counts of indecent assault on a 14 year-old boy.

He also pleaded guilty to seven charges of downloading indecent photographs of children after 84 pictures of girls aged between ten and 13 were found on his computer.

Kenneth Ball, prosecuting, told Bristol Crown Court how the victim, who is now an adult, had been attending the cathedral for organ lessons.

He said: “He had lots and lots of attention from the defendant who showered him with art books and poetry books and showed him love letters between him and his ex-girlfriend.

“The youngster was incredibly stressed. He was still very keen to learn the organ and he didn’t not want to have lessons.

“He continued lessons with the defendant on the organ at the cathedral.”

Ball, who is originally from Lancashire, was assistant organist at Bristol Cathedral from 1991-1994 before moving to be organist of Clifton Cathedral from 1994 until 1998.

He then became acting director of music at Gloucester Cathedral from 1998 and was promoted to acting director in September 2001.

The following year he was forced to resign from the position in 2002 after he was criticised for having an “inappropriate” friendship with a sixth form choir girl.

He then began the role of director of music for the Gloucester parishes of St Mary de Lode and St Mark, much to the anger of many local parishioners.

Ball has faced a vast amount of criticism in the past for a number of inappropriate relationships.

Whilst at Gloucester Cathedral he struck up a close relationship with two teenage girls in the choir.

He also had an affair with an older woman from the church, which resulted in the breakdown of his marriage to wife Elizabeth.

Though Ball faced no legal action for his behaviour, as the women were over the age of 16, he was criticised by churchgoers and asked to leave this cathedral.

Now, more than ten years on, an underage victim of the organist was persuaded to tell police what had happened.

Ball admitted he had acted inappropriately but claimed it was a one off because he was going through a tough time at home.

Robert Duval, defending at Bristol Crown Court, said the incident happened when Ball had become depressed after being overworked and exhausted.

He said: “He was lonely. He was not himself. He fully accepts that he found intimacy with a child that he should not have done.

“He acted in this profoundly reprehensible and selfish way. It is a unique stain on his otherwise unblemished character.

“A short sentence will be an enormous punishment for him.”

Sentencing Judge Michael Roach said: “What you did not only blighted the remainder of his adolescent years but it led to a blight of his adult years as well.”

He handed him a two-and-a-half year sentence yesterday, a five year Sexual Offences Prevention Order and ordered him to register as a sex offender indefinitely.
