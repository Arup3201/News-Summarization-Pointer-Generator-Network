A 73-year-old pensioner has been forced to live in a horse float with no bathroom or kitchen after 13 years of arguing with her local council over plans for her dream retirement home. 

NSW woman Wendy Bishop, along with her husband, bought a block of land for $30,000 in Cessnock in 2001, after the council put 40 lots up for sale. They hoped to build their perfect home.

However, things took an unexpected turn when they found out that the 'For Sale' peg was on the wrong piece of land and they had actually bought a different plot in an unappealing location. 

Wendy now faces the prospect of spending the rest of her life living in a horse float after the local council made her plans completely unrealistic, imposing harsh restrictions and penalties and leaving her $50,000 in debt.

73-year-old Wendy Bishop has been forced to lived in a horse float after an argument with the council over her plot of land

‘We were sitting here having a cup of tea and he asked us (her neighbour) what we were doing and I said "we’re clearing our block" and he said "I'm sorry this is not your block this is our block",' Wendy told A Current Affair.

The new block of land was at the top of a winding road and had a drainage system running through it, which caused Wendy and her husband a lifetime of heartache. 

However it was deemed to be a residential piece of land so Wendy and her husband carried on with their plans of building their perfect home.  

The council didn't make it easy for the elderly couple and five years into their dispute and countless knock backs of their plans, Wendy's beloved husband passed away.

‘They found so many constraints on the land that we were unaware of’, she said.

Cessnock council said the roads were too dangerous, the septic tank was not up to scratch and they did not want any vehicles passing over the drainage system.

For Wendy, there is only one solution and that is to live on her land in a horse float, hoping to shame the council into buying the land from her or changing their stringent conditions

There is not kitchen or bathroom in the float, which is smaller than a prison cell 

‘We did everything we could to try and appease them. It took them five years to give me building approval and in that five years they put me through hell', Wendy said.   

‘I feel that I’ve tried every avenue over the past 13 years and this is my last resort,' the pensioner said, speaking about her horse float, which is currently parked up outside her rented home. 

Wendy is not $50,000 in debt and has sold her wedding ring and her beloved pet horse to pay for her expenses. 

‘It’s ruined me, it’s definitely ruined me,' she said. 

‘I owe the bank I owe everyone I've just tried to keep my head above water.'

Now facing an uncertain future, Wendy is furious that the land was ever put on the market and believes it should never have had a dwelling entitlement title because the coucil's conditions could never be satisfied.

Interestingly, the council was also bidding for the plot of land at the 2001 auction, hoping to secure the land to make way for road widening. However, Wendy outbid the council and won the land.  

Speaking to A Current Affair, Cessnock council says it has closed Wendy's file and won’t be reopening it.

‘It’s still my land and I’ll live on the bloody thing if I have to,' she said.
