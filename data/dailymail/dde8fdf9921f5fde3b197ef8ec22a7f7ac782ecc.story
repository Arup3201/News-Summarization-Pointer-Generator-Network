Childline founder Dame Esther Rantzen has denied that she was told about Jimmy Savile's child sex abuse in 1986 while giving evidence in a cyber stalking trial.

Dame Esther today discussed allegations by child sex abuse victim and justice campaigner Shy Keenan that were printed on the front page of the Sun under the headline 'Abuse campaigner: I told Esther Rantzen about paedo Jimmy Saville 18 years ago.'

She said she 'would have remembered' if she had been told by Ms Keenan that Saville, Gary Glitter and Jonathan King were child abusers.

If she had been told of such an 'explosive allegation' Dame Esther said she would have told her to go to the police.

Dame Esther was giving evidence in the trial of Penny Mellor, 53, from Coven, Wolverhampton, who is alleged to have sent hundreds of abusive tweets to Ms Keenan.

Ms Keenan, from Colchester, Essex, wrote a book in 2008 called Broken, where she told of the abuse she suffered at the hands of her stepfather.

The revelation led to the conviction of Stanley Claridge and others in 2002 and Ms Keenan set up her own organisation, Phoenix Post, with campaigner Dr Sara Payne, whose daughter was murdered. 

Chelmsford Crown Court heard that Mellor has accused Ms Keenan of repeatedly lying in her book, claiming she was a fraudster and an attention seeker. 

Mellor called Dame Esther as a witness to challenge Ms Keenan's credibility.

Dame Esther, wearing a navy dress and black jacket, spent nearly an hour in the witness box today. 

She told the jury that she had not met Mellor before today, although Mellor had sent her some unsolicited emails about her discoveries relating to Ms Keenan.

Dame Esther told the court: 'The Sun journalist told me Shy Keenan told them that I said they were too rich, too powerful and that I, Esther Rantzen, could do nothing about it.

'I said that's absolutely untrue. I never took the view that anyone was too rich or too powerful. I have a track record in this.' 

Dame Esther told the jury at Chelmsford Crown Court that she did not remember meeting Ms Keenan, who had been a guest on her TV show That's Life

She said she was concerned that the claim would taint and damage Childline's reputation.

Dame Esther said she was told when she was a young TV researcher, of 'a rumour' in Fleet Street that Savile was interested in young girls, but that she did not hear anything to justify or corroborate the rumour.

She said that the first time she heard evidence of Savile's abuse was on an ITV Exposure documentary in October 2012, a year after his death. 

She agreed there was a photograph of her with Ms Keenan, taken in the BBC hospitality room in 1986, but said she didn't remember meeting her, and categorically denied the claim.

Dame Esther said: 'Eighteen years ago nobody told me anything about Jimmy Savile's predilections. 

'Shy Keenan didn't talk to me about Jimmy Savile in the BBC hospitality room when she was a guest.'

Dame Esther added she attended the Women of the Year lunch at which Dr Sara Payne and Ms Keenan received an award.

Mellor denies stalking Ms Keenan and causing her serious alarm or distress between January 1 and 16 March 2013 by sending tweets, publishing statements about her in emails sent to work associates and carrying out a course of conduct which had a substantial effect on Ms Keenan's day to day activities.  

Mellor, who is defending herself, claims that Ms Keenan lied in her autobiography Broken, and alleges that she is making money fraudulently out of the book and is an 'attention seeker, Munchausen by internet'.

She also claims that the graphic book is 'titillation for paedophiles', that Ms Keenan should not have written such an account which her own children can read, and ought to be withdrawn.

The jury heard the trigger for Mellor's 239 tweets was when Dame Esther was accused in 2012 by Ms Keenan of being 'a liar' and of having known about Jimmy Savile's behaviour.

Dame Esther told the court Ms Keenan went to the National Association for People Abused in Childhood (NAPAC) and Dame Esther was briefly removed from the website as patron before being  reinstated.

Dame Esther told the court : 'I am still a patron. Nevertheless Ms Keenan told the press that I had been removed and then the papers ran that but that was not true either.'

She said that the allegation was damaging to the work of NAPAC and the NSPCC, as Childline is linked to both.

The court heard a fund-raising event for Childline was even cancelled because the organisers believed it 'was in some way involved or was tainted by the allegations made by Shy Keenan'.

Dame Esther said she had appeared on ITV's This Morning programme to answer Ms Keenan's allegations but said that Ms Keenan had refused to appear at the same time.

Dame Esther said her daughter had defended her on Twitter from attacks by Shy Keenan and her organisation Phoenix Post.

Penny Mellor's own campaign group, Dare to Care, supports those falsely accused of fabricating illness, which is known as Munchausen by Proxy.

The trial continues.
