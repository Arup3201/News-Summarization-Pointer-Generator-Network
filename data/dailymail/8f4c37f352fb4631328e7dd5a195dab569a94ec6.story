Home favourite Hannah Miley kicked off the Commonwealth Games swimming in some style as she set a record in the opening race.

Miley, the defending 400 metres individual medley champion from Delhi, set a Games record time of four minutes 38.27 seconds in the opening swim of the competition.

It secured her place in tonight's final, with domestic rival, Aimee Wilmott of England, also qualifying in the second heat.

Determined: Miley, who reached the 2012 Olympic final in the event, will compete in the final on Thursday night

'It was good, quicker than expected,' 
Miley said. 'Now it's about recovering and 
bringing it back tonight. It will be a great race and I am looking 
forward to it.'

Miley and Wilmott were the quickest 
pair, with England's Danielle Lowe also squeezing into the final. Former
 Brit Ellen Gandy, now swimming for Australia, missed the cut.
