A second man has been charged with the murder and kidnapping of Tennessee nursing student Holly Bobo, who went missing on the morning of April 2011.

Jason Wayne Autry, who was already in prison on separate charges, was indicted today over the case of the missing student, who was last seen by her brother being led into woods at their home.

The 39-year-old is a longtime friend of Zachary Adams, who was also charged with her kidnap and murder in March.

Suspect: Jason Wayne Autry has been charged with the kidnap and murder of Holly Bobo

Missing: Nursing student Holly Bobo disappeared in April 2011. A body was never found but police believe she was murdered

Police said they expected to make further arrests in the three-year-old case, after finding new leads and evidence.

At a press conference on Tuesday afternoon, Tennesse Bureau of Investigation director Mark Gwyn said they had sworn statements from witnesses who claim to have seen Miss Bobo alive with Autry and Adams after she had been reported missing.

He added that they also had physical evidence being analyzed at two crime laboratories, and several witnesses.

'We believe other individuals have knowledge, and possibly others have involvement,' Mr Gwyn told News Channel 5.

'They can expect us to be on their doorsteps very soon.'

He added: 'This is a case the TBI has been continuously working hard to solve now for three years. It has not been easy but I do know truth will prevail.'Â

Threats: Adams appears in court Tuesday over claims he threatened his brother, who is a witness in the case

Connection: Autry, who is currently serving a three-year sentence for aggravated assault, is described as a long-time friend of Adams

'Anyone who had anything to do with Holly's disappearance will be brought to justice,' he added.

The first major break in the case came in February, when the Tennessee Bureau of Investigation agents and FBI searched several areas around Decatur, including the home of Zachary Adams.

Adams, 29, was arrested and charged with kidnapping and murder shortly afterwards.

Miss Bobo's body has never been found.

Adams appeared in court Tuesday on charges of coercion of a witness after allegedly making threats to his brother who is due to testify against him.

Adams' brother allegedly told the FBI he had seen Miss Bobo, 20, alive at his home after she was reported missing.

Adams is accused of asking a fellow inmate to tell his brother: 'He's the one who started this s*** and if he don't shut his mouth he will be in the hole beside her,' CBS News reported.

Autry, 39, has been indicted with especially aggravated kidnapping and first-degree felony murder.

He is already in prison serving a three-year sentence for aggravated assault. He is due to be arraigned Wednesday.

The case about Miss Bobo's disappearance is still active. Prosecutors are considering seeking the death penalty if they get a conviction in the case.
