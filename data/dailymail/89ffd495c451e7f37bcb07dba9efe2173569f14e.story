A married teacher at the centre of a sex scandal has been permanently struck off the teaching register.

Bernadette Smith, 35, had an affair with 16-year-old pupil Gary Ralston after teaching him at Bannockburn High in Stirling.

After narrowly avoiding a prison sentence over the relationship, Smith has now been barred from ever teaching again.

Smith, who worked as history and English teacher before her suspension, has described the relationship as 'ten days of madness'.

Stirling
 Sheriff Court heard last month how the affair, which started with 
kissing in a park and ended with her spending the night in his bed, had 
cost her reputation.

The
 court heard that Smith told police and colleagues she was 'in love' 
with Gary, whom she had taught and also given after-school tuition.

The
 affair started in Smith’s classroom, where she confessed her feelings 
to the boy, before the pair went to a park and had their first kiss.

However, Gary’s grandmother found out what the pair were doing and told the school, which suspended Smith immediately.

 Smith then visited the house Gary shared with his father, Richard, and 
she and Gary spent the night together in the teenager's bed.

She later told police that she had told Mr Ralston about her feelings for his son.

Smith pleaded guilty to engaging in sexual activity with a pupil while in a position of trust between September 13 and 20 last year.

She was placed her under supervision for two years as part of a community sentence, which will also see her put on the sex offenders’ register for the same period.

Papers released by the General Teaching Council (GTC) today reveal she ha nows been permanently banned from the classroom.

The GTC said: 'She indicated to GTC Scotland that she wished to be removed from GTC Scotland’s Register in view of the allegation made against her relating to her fitness to teach.

'In accordance with Rule 3.7.1, she was issued a Removal with Consent Order. This Order has been signed and returned by the Respondent.'

Smith, of Denny, Stirlingshire, waived her right to a full hearing at the GTC in Edinburgh.

She will be served with the official papers with in 14 days and has 28 days to appeal against the decision.

The affair took place after the pair met at Bannockburn High in Stirling, which suspended Smith as soon as the relationship came to light

After the criminal court case, Gary, who waived his anonymity to speak of the relationship, said he didn’t know how the affair had happened, but that Smith had always been his favourite teacher.

He said: 'I was thinking I was quite lucky. A lot of the boys fancied her. I couldn’t believe she was with me.

'It was the last thing I expected. She said she thought she was going crazy but couldn’t help the way she was feeling.'

He said he was worried for Smith’s job, husband and family but said she ‘didn’t seem too bothered’.

He added: ‘We got ready for bed and I felt nervous. I got into bed with my boxers on.

'She took off her top, but kept her bra and jeans on, and slid in beside me. We cuddled and talked – nothing else happened.’

Following the court proceedings, Smith said that her life had changed after her husband had an affair and a child with another woman.

She said: 'The police asked me if I loved Gary. I said I did. But I realise now I didn’t. Looking back, it is hard to explain how I felt at the time.

'I didn’t fancy Gary but I was so consumed by wanting to make sure he was OK that even when I was sitting in a cell at the police station, all I could think about was him.'
