Andy Burnham, the former Secretary of Health, was reportedly furious that the report on substandard care  at Basildon and Thurrock hospital in Essex came out

Labour tried to block the publication of a devastating report into appalling hospital neglect before the last election.

Ministers told the Care Quality Commission not to release its verdict on Basildon and Thurrock hospital in Essex, where patients were dying from poor care.

Inspectors found blood on curtains and chairs and catheters left on the floor at the flagship foundation hospital. Death rates in A&E were a third above average.

But hours before the CQC was due to publish the report in November 2009, the Department of Health told the watchdog to stop. Newly-released emails show that the then Health Secretary Andy Burnham was furious when the report was later made public amid massive media coverage.

They also show officials were asked to ‘spin’ a major NHS report, again in the run-up to the 2010 election.

The revelation puts further pressure on Mr Burnham, who is widely tipped to lose his job as Labour health spokesman in an imminent reshuffle.

He has been accused of failing to act over a number of failing hospitals – most notably Mid Staffordshire, where hundreds died of neglect.

The emails were obtained from the CQC by Tory MP Steve Barclay under freedom of information rules. The commission was due to publish its ‘state of care report’ into hospitals and care homes in February 2010, three months before the election.

Yet an email sent round by a senior CQC boss following a meeting with one of Mr Burnham’s junior ministers instructs them that, ‘given the political environment’, the report should be ‘largely positive’.

The memo, sent in January 2010, urges staff to ‘be careful about language’ and ensure it is ‘hard-hitting without presenting critical data’.

The message from Martin Marshall, the CQC’s director of clinical quality, to Jill Finney, the deputy chief executive and Cynthia Bower, the chief executive, concludes: ‘It is really important that we get the tone absolutely right.’

Another email – from Finney to Bower – refers to ‘anxieties’ about the publication of the report into Basildon hospital.

It says ‘the secretary of state was furious’ when the report – despite the block on it – was spotted on a government website by journalists.

Mr Barclay, MP for North East Cambridgeshire and member of the Commons public accounts committee, said: ‘Mr Burnham’s position is now untenable. The longer he stays in post the more discredited his party’s position is on the NHS.

‘He is furious when bad news comes out and his officials are saying whatever you do don’t put anything bad in the press. His reputation is seriously damaged.’

Julie Bailey, who set up the campaign group Cure the NHS after her mother Bella died at Mid Staffordshire, said: ‘The whole culture within Labour was to keep problems hidden. That’s why we lost so many lives. Unless we address this culture we’ll just lose more people.’

Tory Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt said: ‘The care of NHS patients is too important for political meddling.’ Earlier this week he announced the CQC would become entirely independent of the Department of Health in the hope that it will be more critical of how the NHS is run.

Eleven hospital trusts were put into special measures after a major investigation by the NHS’s medical director Professor Sir Bruce Keogh uncovered ‘deep-rooted’ failings.

Experts estimated that thousands of patients had needlessly died at these trusts over the past decade.

Professor Sir Brian Jarman, a world expert on hospital mortality, sent Mr Burnham a list of trusts where the death rates had been very high for several years but it was ignored.

Sir Brian said health ministers had presided over a ‘denial machine’ designed to prevent criticism of the NHS.

But a Labour spokesman said: ‘This is the latest stage of an on-going Conservative Party smear campaign against the last Labour government. These old, unfounded allegations have already been answered in full.

‘No evidence has ever been produced to suggest anything other than that ministers acted properly at all times. The facts show that ministers did the precise opposite of what is alleged.

‘When problems at Basildon and Thurrock hospital first emerged, Andy Burnham made a full statement to Parliament and ordered an in-depth investigation of every hospital in England to be completed before the general election. Action was also taken to improve the internal running of the CQC.

‘On Basildon, a CQC press officer briefed the media without authorisation and before the Department of Health was officially notified. This was a breach of established practice and left the Department unable to respond properly to the many enquiries it was receiving, from public and press, following reports on rolling news programmes.’

Miss Finney, along with Miss Bower, was accused of conspiring to cover up a separate report into poor care at a maternity unit – both deny the allegations. A third employee, Anna Jefferson, has now been cleared of wrongdoing in the case.
