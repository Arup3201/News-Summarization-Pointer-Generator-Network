Gary Neville believes Manchester United’s failure this season is down to panicking in the transfer market.

United finished seventh this season – the lowest they have been for 24 years – and failed to qualify for the Champions League or Europa League next season.

And former right back Neville says there are very few positives for United to take from the last season following the appointment and then sacking 10 months later of David Moyes.

Silence: Gary Neville pauses after being ask to find a positive in Manchester United's season

Silver lining: The Sky Sports pundits found Neville's silence quite comical

Big miss: United defender Nemanja Vidic will leave the club for a move to Inter Milan in the summer

Low point: The Red Devils have had a poor season despite progressing to the Champions League's last eight

Speaking 
as part of a Sky Sports panel for the Football Special Season Review, 
Neville was asked to find a silver lining for his former club by 
presenter Dave Jones.

The pundit stared into the distance for several seconds as he struggled to find a positive before breaking into laughter.

He then said: ‘United have panicked into signing players who were not their top choices.

‘It
 was quite public last summer who United’s targets were – it was either 
(Gareth) Bale or (Cristiano) Ronaldo, it was (Cesc) Fabregas, it was 
(Leighton) Baines and it was (Marouane) Fellaini.

Ryan Giggs (centre) was in charge for four games, winning two, drawing one and losing one

Out: David Moyes was sacked after a disappointing campaign in his first season as United boss

‘They
 were the targets, it was publicised – and I don’t know why because 
Manchester United have always kept their transfer dealings really quiet.
 I’m not quite sure how all of a sudden everyone knows who they are 
signing.

‘But
 if they can’t get No 1, No 2, three, four. I’m not in a rush. As a 
Manchester United fan, I’d rather seen James Wilson come through than 
some fourth choice striker who isn’t at the top of the list.

‘I don’t want signing number eight, nine, 10 because they can’t get No 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7. I have no interest in that.’

New man: Louis van Gaal is expected to be named the new Manchester United manager this week

Holland
 manager Louis van Gaal is expected to be named as United’s new manager 
on Wednesday and Neville believes the Dutchman will need to take his 
time assess the job he has.

The
 Sky Sports pundit and England coach expects United to get back into the
 Champions League next season due to the fact they won’t be in Europe but says he needs to rebuild the sqaud.

He
 added: 'Luis Van Gaal is potentially going to get the job and he will 
have to asses it. It won’t happen overnight, but they have a great 
chance to get back into the Champions League, especially as they have no
 European football next season.

Chance to shine: Neville says he would rather a young player like James Wilson is given a chance if United miss out on one of their top targets

'If
 he decides he wants eight players, that doesn’t mean he should go and 
buy eight players. Signing three or four real top quality – and 
improving next season, bedding them in and then going again with two or 
three more the year after is the organic approach I would expect 
Manchester United to have.

'However,
 I didn’t expect Manchester United to sack a manager after ten months, 
so what’s going to happen in the next few months, who knows?'
