David Cameron turns 48 today but it will be UKIP with something to celebrate.

As the Prime Minister marks his birthday in Number 10, some 80 miles away in Clacton history is being made as voters go to the polls in the by-election triggered by Tory MP Douglas Carswell's defection.

Polls suggest UKIP will easily win the seat, giving the party its first elected MP in the Commons which Nigel Farage hails as a 'new dawn' in British politics.

Polls have put UKIP on course to win up to 6,000 more votes than the Conservatives, in what is set to be a humiliating by-election defeat for Mr Cameron.

In a separate by-election being held today, Labour is expected to hold its Heywood and Middleton seat but UKIP could break through 30 per cent to come second.

Mr Farage told the Telegraph: 'It is a new dawn. It is the end of the closed shop of two-and-a-half party politics.

'Winning the European elections was an earthquake. Clacton is a shift in the tectonic plates of British politics. And if we win in Heywood and Middleton, it will be Krakatoa.' 

At the 2010 general election Mr Carswell won the seat with a 12,000 majority for the Tories, and UKIP did not stand against the prominent Eurosceptic.

The Tories have been rocked by Mr Carswell's defection in August, which was followed by Mark Reckless switching parties on the eve of the Conservative party conference last month.

Douglas Carswell was one of the most prominent Eurosceptic Tory MPs but his defection to UKIP in August was still a major surprise in Westminster.

The libertarian Clacton MP regularly spoke out against the Government on Europe, the economy and Parliamentary reform.

The maverick backbencher once led calls for MPs’ expenses to be opened up to the public– but was then criticised after it emerged he claimed cash back for a ‘love chair’ for his home. 

He is popular among many of his former Tory his colleagues, some of whom refused to campaign against him.

In Clacton his popularity outstrips that of the Tories. One senior Conservative said: 'There is not a Tory machine campaign machine in Clacton, it is a Carswell machine.'

Mr Carswell grew up in Uganda where his doctor parents worked. 

He was educated at St Andrews School, Kenya, before moving to the exclusive Charterhouse boarding school in Surrey.

Senior Tory strategists accept they stand little chance of holding Clacton, where Mr Carswell has a strong personal following.

But Mr Cameron has made clear he will not give up on Mr Reckless' Rochester and Strood constituency, accusing him on betraying Tory activists who worked hard to get his 'fat arse' on the Commons benches. 

Mr Reckless has a small lead in the polls, but the Conservatives believe they can hold it, and will head there on Friday afternoon after the Clacton result to campaign.

The Prime Minister made a last ditch visit to Clacton last week, and acknowledged the Tories were 'the underdogs'.

The Conservative candidate fighting Mr Carswell is Giles Watling, an actor best known for his appearance as the vicar in the 1980s sitcom 'Bread', who is from the area and has been a local councillor for several years.

But in a sign of the Tory attitude to the seat, London Mayor Boris Johnson was caught out on live radio this week when he could not remember Mr Watling's name. 

Quizzed on the radio about the Conservatives' chances in this week's by-election, Mr Johnson could only venture that the candidate was a 'superb man... Stirling? Girling? Something like that.'

In Heywood and Middleton in Greater Manchester, Labour have approached the by-election with increasing panic amid concerns that Ed Miliband is not in touch with the voters about immigration.

One MP said yesterday that if UKIP finished within 2,000 votes of Labour there 'alarm bells would start ringing' about Mr Miliband. 

The MP, who did not wish to be named, said it would suggest that the direction of the party 'was not one that was appealing to our core voters'.

A study last week found that the UKIP surge could prevent Labour taking dozens of Tory target seats at the next election.

Voters are also going to the polls in Heywood in Greater Manchester in a by-election triggered by the death of long-standing Labour MP Jim Dobbin

By-elections are rarely dominated by debates on the intricacies of policy.

More often they are a chance for voters to give the government of the day a bloody nose.

But Clacton is unusual, because instead of being triggered by a death or a resignation, the incumbent MP is standing again, albeit for a different party.

The European Union is front and centre in the contest, with Douglas Carswell complaining that David Cameron's Tories are 'not serious about real change'.

But UKIP is also trading on the anti-politics mood which has spread across much of the country, notably in deprived areas like Clacton.

By far the biggest factor in Mr Carswell's likely victory is his own popularity.

He won his first election in 2005 by just 920 votes, but was returned in 2010 with a 12,000 majority.

The Tories admit they cannot compete with that, but hope to do better against UKIP in other seats. 

Dr Matthew Ashton, a politics expert at Nottingham Trent University, said: 'If UKIP gain their first MP then the party will be in the unusual position of having a representative in parliament, but not the leader of the party. 

'In the short-term this isn't necessarily a problem. However if the party gains more seats, yet Farage fails to be elected, this could lead to possible tensions and even a leadership challenge.

'A win for UKIP won't necessarily lead to any more defections. 

'If any MP did decide to leave their party it would be difficult for them to not follow the example of Carswell and call a by-election. For any MP with a small majority, or a majority based on party support, rather than their personal vote, this would be a huge gamble.' 

Clacton has become a key battlefield in the rise of UKIP following Mr Carswell's defection - but the region has already proven to be fertile ground for the party.

There have been signs for some time that the loyalty of so-called "Essex man" - valued by the Conservatives since the time of Margaret Thatcher - has been waning with voters keen to embrace an alternative.

In recent council elections, authorities in Basildon, Castle Point and Southend-on-Sea shifted from Tory control to no overall control after Ukip made significant gains. The party also made gains in Thurrock. All of the districts had traditionally been Tory strongholds.

This success was reinforced by the European elections with Nigel Farage's party polling 542,812 up from 313,921 at the previous poll. This compared to a Tory vote of 446,569.
