England midfielder Fabian Delph may need surgery after suffering a shoulder injury during a freak training ground fall.

Paul Lambert will be without his key player for the trip to Everton and medical checks are being undertaken to determine whether he misses the next two games for Roy Hodgson as well.

England play Slovenia in a Euro 2016 qualifier at Wembley on November 15, then welcome Scotland three days later in a friendly.

Lambert was unable to say if Delph had dislocated his shoulder, which usually takes four weeks to heal, but described the blow as a ‘nightmare’.

‘Nobody was near him when he did it,’ said the Villa manager. ‘He fell on his shoulder and we need to get it checked out.’

Lambert could not rule out the possibility that Delph might have to need an operation once his medical team have established the extent of the injury.

He added: ‘We don’t know how bad it is or whether resting it for a couple of weeks is enough.’ Asked if surgery could be required, Lambert said: ‘We don’t know. That’s up to the medical people.’

Injury-hit Christian Benteke has not featured for Aston Villa since last season

The accident is untimely for Delph, who has been in excellent form this season and established himself in the national side.

More positive news for Villa is that captain Ron Vlaar looks certain to be fit to start at Goodison. The Holland international has missed the last four games with a calf problem but is set to win his race against time to face Everton.

Lambert desperately needs him back after Philippe Senderos suffered a thigh injury on international duty with Switzerland.

Christian Benteke is close to starting his first match in six months on Saturday having had no reaction as he recovers from his ruptured Achilles.

The Belgium striker had 20 minutes as a substitute against Manchester City and played in a behind-closed-doors friendly against Leicester during the international break.

'He’s feeling a lot healthier after a long time out,’ said Lambert.
