Decorative: This painting of a cardinal by former President George W. Bush will feature on a Christmas ornament

Former President George W. Bush is hoping to spread some festive cheer thanks to his passion for art, after one of his works was chosen to feature on a Christmas ornament.

Available exclusively online and from the Bush Center Museum, in Dallas, Texas, the ornament features the image of a cardinal, a brightly-coloured songbird common to north America.

Mr Bush originally painted the image for his friend, Ambassador Warren Tichenor, and was selected by his wife, Laura.

The three-dimensional metal artwork is the first commemorative Bush Center 
Christmas ornament to be released and is a limited edition.

It is 
available in green or red packaging, and retails in the Museum Store at 
the Bush Center or online for $29.98.

The painting will also be featured on Christmas cards.

Speaking about his work, which is untitled, Mr Bush said: 'Well I've become a painter and I 
painted a cardinal for a friend of ours.

'Laura liked the bright red and 
the greens of the foliage and chose my painting, for which I'm grateful. I'm flattered and I hope my 
painting meets expectations.'

Earlier this week, the 67-year-old revealed more about his new hobby on The Tonight Show with Jay Leno.

Bush's newfound passion for painting has become the fodder for many a late-night comic, including Mr Leno, who will step down from his popular chat show and be replaced by Jimmy Fallon in February.

On
Tuesday, Mr Bush surprised his host by giving him a 
portrait, depicting a close-up of Mr Leno's 
unmistakable face with his prominent chin and a shock of silver hair 
against the backdrop of his studio.

'I can't make fun of him now.' Mr Leno said. He later promised to hang the art piece in his home that night.

Mr
Bush, who revealed that he has been painting pets - and the occasional semi-nude 
self-portrait in the shower - said that he has been taking lessons once a
week with a female teacher in Dallas.

'I told her, “There's a Rembrandt trapped in this body. Your job is to find him,"' said Mr Bush.

Since
leaving office in 2009, Mr Bush has kept a low profile and has been 
reluctant to publicly discuss the policies of his successor, President 
Barack Obama.

Flattered: President George W Bush spoke about his chosen artwork, alongside wife Laura

During Tuesday’s 
interview on The Tonight Show, Mr Bush reiterated his position, saying 
that it is not good for the country when a former president criticizes 
the decisions of his successor.

However, the Republican could not pass up on the opportunity to get in a gentle jab at Mr Obama, a Democrat.

When
Mr Leno pointed out that nowadays, late-night comedians are busy making
fun of the embattled president, Bush said with a chuckle: ‘Better him 
than me.’   

The 43rd 
president of the United States went on to explain that he does not miss 
being at the helm of the nation, adding that ‘eight years is plenty.’

Mr Bush also spoke about his 
brother Jeb's presidential prospects, his mother, Barbara Bush and his health scare in August, when he underwent a stent operation after doctors discovered that one of his arteries was nearly 
entirely blocked.

Mr Bush, who was joined by wife Laura, also briefly talked about becoming a grandfather, saying that 
while it took him a while to develop a connection with daughter Jenna's 
baby - 'cause the kid didn't say much' - he said that he was now 
‘hooked.’
