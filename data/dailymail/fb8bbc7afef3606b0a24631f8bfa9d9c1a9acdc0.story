A popular ESPN Radio host in Miami has been taken off the air after erecting Ohio billboards targeted at LeBron James.

Dan LeBatard was suspended for two days after a billboard with a picture of two championship rings was thrown up this week in the departed Heat star’s hometown of Akron. Several more are planned for the Cleveland area.

‘You’re welcome, LeBron. Love, Miami. Paid for by ’ the billboard reads. It includes pictures of his two championship rings won while with the team, and says it was paid for by LeBatard.

'You're welcome': These billboards erected across Akron and Cleveland mocked LeBron James leaving Miami, and landed radio host Dan LeBatard a two-day suspension

Fan acrimony has been high in Miami since King James bolted town to return to the Cleveland Cavaliers.

ESPN called the billboard a stunt in a statement announcing LeBatard’s two-day suspension, but he disagreed.

Dan will be off the air for two days, returning Monday,’ the network said. ‘His recent stunt does not reflect ESPN’s standards and brand. Additionally, we were not made aware of his plans in advance.’

LeBatard disagreed, saying ‘I guess ESPN didn’t find it all quite as funny as I did,’ in a text to Miami Herald reporter Greg Cote, a contributor to the radio show.

‘The Dan LeBatard Show’ is based out of Miami but syndicated nationally on several ESPN Radio affiliates.

Also a reporter for the Herald, LeBatard told the paper he initially tried to buy full page ads in Ohio newspapers – they rejected the idea.

The billboards were ‘meant in fun — which, of course, will turn into Cleveland people getting filled with rage, poison and irrational hostility and want to use those billboards as a guillotine,’ said the radio host.

‘Sports are so great, the more irrational the better. This is a publicity stunt disguised as a movement… It’s just fun anarchy.’

LeBatard is no stranger to controversy.

He earned a lifetime ban from the Baseball Writers Association of America earlier this year after selling his Hall of Fame vote to Deadspin and its readers.

James announced last month in a Sports Illustrated essay that he was returning to the Cavaliers.
