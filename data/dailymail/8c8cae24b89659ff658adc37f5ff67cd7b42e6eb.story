Apple is to pay £66million in compensation to parents whose children ran up massive bills using its free apps.

Youngsters who made purchases playing the online games generated hefty charges on their parents’ credit cards.

Now as many as 23million people in the US are eligible for a refund. However, the decision is unlikely to affect British families.

Hidden costs: Angry Birds is one of the free-to-download games from iTunes that has in-game purchases which lure youngsters into spending their parents' money

A number of software companies have 
developed games that are popular with children. These ‘bait apps’ let 
you buy credit in order to progress through the game.

When children purchase ‘currency’, 
their parent’s iTunes account gets automatically charged.

Apple started 
requiring users to input a password to authorise transactions in March 
2011. But many parents around the world had already been hit by large 
and unexpected bills.

A US legal case was triggered by a 
nine-year-old girl from Pennsylvania who bought $200 (£132) of ‘virtual 
money’ from three free Apple games. In a lawsuit brought by her father, 
the games were described as ‘highly addictive’ and designed to ‘compel’ 
children to buy game currency.

Under the terms of the case settlement, Apple has now agreed to offer refunds worth a total of $100million (£66million).

The company has not announced plans to compensate any parents in the UK.

Those claiming $30 or more from Apple may choose to receive a cash refund instead of an iTunes store credit, according to the filing.

The case involves games such as Angry Birds, Zombie Takeover, Playmobil Pirates, and Racing Penguin, some of which are offered as free downloads on tablets such as Apple's iPad.

Money down the drain: Payments are taken automatically from the credit
cards of the adult owners of the computer or smartphone via, for example,
an iTunes or Google account

Often, the first time a parent finds 
out about the purchases is when their credit card is rejected at a 
check-out till or they find a black hole in their current account.

The
lawsuit, filed by five parents in 2011, involved allegations 
surrounding purchases in certain downloaded apps, which plaintiffs claim
were made by children without the knowledge or permission of the 
account holder.

The lawsuit 
also alleged that 'Apple failed to adequately disclose that third-party 
Game Apps, largely available for free and rated as containing content 
suitable for children, contained the ability to make In-App Purchases.'

The
founder of parenting website Netmums, Siobhan Freegard, told the Daily 
Mail earlier this month: ‘We have heard of cases where parents have been
hit with bills for hundreds of pounds as the apps are often linked to 
their card details through iTunes. Often the bills aren’t immediate and 
it takes days to find out they have been charged.’

Last year, six-year-old Jake Sadler spent £1,000 playing Zombie Takeover, which was free to download, on his mother’s iPad.

His parents only discovered the problem after receiving a call for their bank’s fraud team who had concerns with ‘unusual activity’ on their account.

Taking aim at Apple: Today's proposed settlement requires court approval. The court will hear the settlement on March 1.

Jake’s mother Gemma, 31, a nursing 
support assistant, from Portsmouth, said: ‘We had no idea the money was 
even going out of our account until the fraud squad at the bank rang us.

‘And when we looked at our bank account and found such a large amount of money missing I felt absolutely sick.’

In theory, Apple accounts require users to input a password to clear any purchases.

However,
if the parent uses the password once, this creates a 15 minute window 
where the child can then make a series of purchases.

Separately,
children who have become engrossed in a game will often pester their 
parents continuously to allow them to make purchases.

Spencer Whitman of app protection firm AppCertain said: ‘App developers are not often altruistic.

‘They
often include in-app purchases hidden behind the free price tag. Either
they offer a small amount of play, then charge for continued use; offer
in-app purchases for more in-game content such as extra areas of play 
or upgrades; or they constantly interrupt game play to ask for in-app 
purchases.’

Justine Roberts, founder of Mumsnet, said: ‘It’s all too easy for our children to get sucked into games and, before you know it, they’ve racked up huge costs buying coins, berries and doughnuts.

‘You do need to keep an eye on your child’s device settings and to keep your password for purchases private at all costs.’

Which? executive director Richard Lloyd said: ‘It’s far too easy for children to run up huge bills on phone apps when most default settings allow ‘in-app purchases’ without asking for a confirmation or password.

‘If your child has run up a huge bill without your knowledge, contact the app store or manufacturer, as you may be eligible for a refund.’

Apple said: ‘All iOS devices have built-in controls that give parents and guardians the ability to restrict access to content, such as internet access and age-rated content.

‘Parental controls also give parents and guardians the option to turn off functionality, such as purchasing from iTunes, and the ability to turn off in-app purchases.’

Today's proposed settlement requires court approval. The court will hear the settlement on March 1.

Apple could not immediately be reached for comment outside of regular U.S. business hours.
