Roberto Martinez admitted Leighton Baines is Everton's penalty king after Kevin Mirallas missed from the spot in Monday night's stalemate against West Brom.

The Belgian took responsibility after Joleon Lescott was penalised for handling in the box, despite Baines being the Toffees' normal penalty taker.

However, Mirallas, who was successful from 12 yards in the shoot-out in last week's FA Cup clash with West Ham, was left red-faced after his kick skimmed the post and went wide.

Martinez told Sky Sports: 'Our penalty taker is Leighton Baines, he's the number one penalty taker, but, in the same way, we had a penalty shoot-out on Tuesday night against West Ham and, as you saw, Kevin Mirallas takes the penalties really well and he felt really confident and he wanted to take it.

'At that point you need to feel confident and he was feeling that he could take the penalty and Leighton Baines was quite happy to allow him to do that.

'Only the takers can miss the penalties, but both have got the qualities to score goals.

'Obviously missing the target makes it a big issue, if he hits the back of the net nothing would have happened, but both players have got enough quality, enough personality and enough character to convert the penalty at that moment.'

He added: 'The big disappointment is that we couldn't convert the penalty, not who took it or why we missed it.'

Mirallas was hauled off at the break, but Martinez insists the player was struggling and not 100 per cent fit.
