A North Carolina man is accused of selling a crushed up Pop-Tart to an undercover police officer while trying to pass it off as cocaine. 

Cameron Mitchell was making a delivery on June 19 to a convenience store in Halifax, North Carolina, where the 30-year-old allegedly agreed to sell his special blend of 'crack cocaine' to the man for $20.

Authorities tested the substance he handed over, and it came up negative for cocaine but apparently positive for the popular frosted breakfast pastry.

Mitchell says committed the use because he needed the cash

There was no word on which flavor he pretended was cocaine.  

Agents later found Mitchell's delivery truck at another convenience store, and they say he admitted to the ruse, WCTI12 reported.

He was arrested on September 4 and faces charges of selling or delivering a counterfeit controlled substance and creating a counterfeit controlled substance.

Mitchell, of Rocky Mount, North Carolina, allegedly told the agents he did it because he was desperate for cash.  

He is scheduled to appear in court on October 1.
