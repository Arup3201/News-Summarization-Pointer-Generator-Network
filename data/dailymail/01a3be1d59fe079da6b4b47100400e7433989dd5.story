A Massachusetts mother who has been stranded in Brazil with her six-year-old daughter amid a custody dispute with the South American father expects to return home soon.

Representatives for both sides said today that a Brazilian judge has decided to return the U.S. passports that federal police had seized from the American visitors.

Shauna Hadden, a 33-year-old social worker from Agawam, says she brought her daughter Ava to Brazil in May so the girl could reconnect with her father.

But a lawyer for the 32-year-old 
father, Donizete Machado, had said he had authorities seize their 
passports because Hadden hadn't let him visit with Ava.

The lawyer also claims Hadden used airline tickets Machado paid for to fly over and meet a boyfriend.

Shauna's mother, Linda Hadden, says her daughter hopes to be home this weekend.

Shauna had
created a Facebook called 'Trapped in Brazil' to draw attention to her 
plight and beg for help from American authorities before the 
breakthrough in the case.

On
the page, which has more than 12,000 likes, she claims her ex-husband, 
Donizete Machado, filed a custody suit for Ava in the Brazilian court as
soon as they touched town in the country and police officers with guns 
confiscated their passports.

Shauna met and married Machado in the U.S. They had Ava in 2007 and divorced in 2009, before he was deported in 2010 for being in the country illegally - something Shauna knew nothing about.

Battle: The custody battle began when the mother and daughter touched down in Brazil in May

Scared: Shauna, pictured with Ava, was frightened that she'll be forced to leave Ava in Brazil

Since then, Shauna has rebuilt their 
relationship for Ava's sake, and the father and daughter have had 
regular contact over Skype.

As such, she thought it would be OK to organize a visit.

'She
has full custody of Ava. He lives in Brazil. Shauna planned a trip on 
May 21 where she would take Ava to visit her father and extended family 
in Brazil,' her mother, Linda Hadden, told ABC News.

'We thought it was a great opportunity for Ava to learn about her heritage.'

Machado bought flights for the two of them and they set off.

But when they arrived the mother received a call from a man who lived in Machado's town warning her not to come.

'Her ex-husband was planning to take Ava from her,' Hadden said.

Divorce: Shauna met and married Ava's father, Donizete Machado, in the U.S and in 2007 Ava was born

Help: Shauna said she has spent more than $6000 in lawyers' fees

Instead, Shauna took Ava to stay with friends in the north, which made Machado even more angry.

'He and his sisters started sending my daughter nasty messages saying things like 'You're going to have to stay in Brazil forever,' she said.

Frightened, Shauna decided to get on a plane back to the U.S. but Machado had cancelled their return tickets.

On June 6, she discovered Machado had filed for custody and the same day officers showed up at the friends' home with guns.

'They had guns and demanded that they 
take Ava's passport,' she said. 'They said they were carrying out an 
order from a judge to get Ava's passport. Shauna was scared and didn't 
know what to do. She gave them Ava's passport and her own too,' Hadden 
said.

The U.S. Embassy in Brazil told Shauna to get an attorney, which she did and has spent more than $6,000 on lawyers fees so far, she claims.

Visit: Shauna took 6-year-old Ava to Brazil so that Ava could see her father

Missing home: Ava's grandmother is in touch with her congressman about getting them home

Machado's initial request for 
immediate custody was denied by the court and a request for someone to 
bring Ava to him was also refused.

Then he wanted a supervised visit with Ava, which the judge granted.

Shauna has been gathering media interest through her Facebook campaign and, fluent in Portugese, she has does numerous Brazilian interviews explaining her plight and the community has been very supportive, her mother told ABC.

Meanwhile, Hadden said she had been working with her congressman Senator Elizabeth Warren, the State Department and the Brazilian government, to try get the mother and daughter home.

'We just want them both to come home 
safely,' Hadden said. 'We have 
no ill will towards anyone.'
