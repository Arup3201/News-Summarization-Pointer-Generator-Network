At first glance they look like ordinary trees - albeit very tall, thin ones.

But on closer inspection it becomes clear that the palms, pines and firs are in fact cellphone towers.

Phone companies in South Africa have taken to disguising the controversial masts so they fit into suburban streets.

Surroundings: The masts are disguised as trees native to the area

Pioneering: The idea was first developed in South Africa in 1996 when a mast was turned into a palm

Photographer Dillon Marsh has created a series of some of the camouflaged towers erected around Cape Town.

Called 'Invasive Species', the collections shows the lengths telecommunications companies have gone to make residents feel comfortable with having the masts so near to their homes.

Mr Marsh said: 'A palm tree appeared almost overnight in a suburb of Cape Town.

'This was supposedly one of the world's first ever disguised cell phone tower.

'Since then these trees have spread across the city, South Africa and the rest of the world.

'Invasive Species explores the relationship between the environment and the disguised towers of Cape Town and its surrounds.'

Fake trees: Dillon Marsh has photographed the masts for a collection called Invasive Species

The features masts were erected in suburbs or towns all within 60km Cape Town's city centre.

The photographer said it took six months to complete the work.

He said: 'There were already a wide variety of designs by the time I started photographing.

'The designs loosely mimic trees that are found in the local environment.'

According to Wired, the world's first Palm Pole Tower was developed in the mid-1990s by Ivo Branislav Lazic of South African telecommunications company Brolaz Projects and his colleague Aubrey Trevor Thomas.

Project: Mr Marsh said the series explores the relationship between the phone masts and their environment

Challenge: The photographer spent six months on the project and all the masts are within 60km of Cape Town

It was placed into service in 1996 for Vodacom, one of South Africa's leading cellular operators.

Brolaz say that more than a 1000 of these and similar camouflaged structures have been erected in South Africa and are also exported to USA, Europe, the Middle East and Australia.

The company claim that increasing public approval, as well as advancements in antenna technology, have seen them expand the range of camouflaged options from the original Palm Trees to include other trees, lighthouses, windmills and roadside advertising structures.
