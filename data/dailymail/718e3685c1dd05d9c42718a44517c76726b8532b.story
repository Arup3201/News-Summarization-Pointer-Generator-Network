When in Rome, it's tempting to try the city's world-famous ice cream.

But some British tourists were left with a nasty aftertaste – a £54 bill.

Following their complaints over being charged £13.50 each for their take-away cones, an Italian politician has called for a clampdown on such extortionate prices.

Outraged: Holidaymakers Roger Bannister, his brother Steven and their wives Wendy and Joyce with the receipt for their ice cream

Roger and Stephen Bannister, 58 and 
68, and their wives Wendy, 61, and Joyce, 69, all from Stourbridge in 
the West Midlands, were landed with the astonishing bill on Sunday, the 
last day of their holiday.

The group had stopped at the Antica Roma ice cream parlour and bar close to the famous Spanish Steps in the city centre.

Although they requested three scoops 
of ice cream each, they avoided numerous toppings and extras, wary of 
mounting costs, so they were shocked when they were  charged so much.

Roger Bannister said: 'How can they get away with charging £50 for four ice cream cones?

Ripped off: The scandal is reigniting a row in the country about tourists being 'ripped off' by local businesses

'The cones had three flavours and a 
couple of wafers but if we wanted whipped cream that was another three 
euros on top each. We knew prices were expensive if you sat down, but we
 took the ice creams away – how much would it have cost us if we had sat
 down?'

Mr Bannister, a company executive, 
said the group had been on a six-day trip to Rome, adding: 'Up until 
then we'd had a brilliant time, but that left a bad taste in the mouth –
 quite literally. To be honest the ice cream wasn't that nice either. 
We'd had better ones earlier on in the holiday.

'I felt I had been ripped off but what could I do?'

Matteo Costantini, a local councillor,
 said of the tourists' ordeal: 'They were justifiably outraged at what 
they had been asked to pay, and it should not be allowed. There needs to
 be a clampdown on places like this that charge extortionate prices to 
unsuspecting tourists.

'It does nothing for the image of the city and will probably put people off coming here.'

Mr Costantini added that he had 
personally offered to refund the money to the group but they had told 
him donate it to a charity.

The ice cream parlour in question gave
 a chilly response. A staff member who refused to give her name said: 
'The prices are clearly on display. They got what they asked for – four 
ice creams.'

High cost: The family were horrified by the high price after buying ice creams at the Antica Roma bar (left of picture) in Rome

She said the gelateria's most 
expensive cone is 25 euros (£21) and added: 'They got 16 euros' worth of
 ice cream each – almost a kilo. What more did they want?

'We get this all the time … but the 
prices are there in black and white. If they don't want the ice cream 
they can go somewhere else.'

Carlo Rienzi, president of Italy's 
Codacons consumer group, said it had officially requested 'an immediate 
investigation into this fraud'.
