Could you live on just £1 a day for a week?

A supermarket chain has created a menu of recipes to help families eat on just £1 a day.

Aldi has teamed up with nutritionist Angela Dowden and put together a week-long menu of 'nutritional and tasty breakfasts, lunches and dinners all for under £1', to run alongside the Live Below The Line challenge, an initiative of the Global Poverty Project.

The menu includes meals such as pea soup, ham bagels, baked potatoes with mushrooms, sardine fishcakes and turkey chilli.

Most recipes serve three to four people, which means singletons might struggle unless they don't mind eating the same thing for lunch and dinner, then leftovers every other day.

High-profile celebrities including Ben Affleck, 
Hugh Jackman and cast members from TOWIE have accepted the challenge of living 
below the poverty line - spending under £1 per day on food for one whole
 week - in order to raise awareness of extreme poverty across the world.

With their menu, Aldi hope to inspire the nation to get behind the challenge.

Angela Dowden said: 'Eating for less doesn’t have to mean existing entirely on a diet of beans, rice and pasta.

'Buying versatile ingredients helps to create a combination of tasty dishes, as well as cutting costs. Once you know how, eating for £1-a-day can be easier than you'd think.'

Using ingredients that can all be bought at Aldi - though variations are available at all good food outlets - Angela has created a range of recipes 'to appeal to every palate', all for under £1.
