Olympic hero Mo Farah beamed yesterday as he revealed his wife Tania has given birth to twin girls and he would be inscribing their names on his two gold medals.

Team GB runner Mo, who took gold in the men’s 10,000m and 5,000m events at the London Games, described the twins’ arrival as ‘very exciting’ and said he was present at the birth on Friday in a London hospital.

The 29-year-old later tweeted: ‘Great news about the birth of my little baby girls! Twins! . . . Thanks to my wife . . . !! Shabba!!’

Happy family: Mo Farah with his stepdaughter Rihanna and then pregnant wife Tania after securing 5,000m Olympic gold

Millions of TV viewers saw a heavily 
pregnant Tania, 26, in the Olympic Stadium cheering Mo on alongside his 
stepdaughter Rihanna, before rushing on to the track to embrace him.

She gave birth 13 days after her 
husband’s Olympic triumph in the 5,000m, and just 48 hours before he was
 due to compete in the Aviva Birmingham Grand Prix race today.

The timing meant he saw the twins born, but then had to travel up to Birmingham to prepare for the race.

Yesterday, a delighted Mo told a 
packed press conference: ‘It’s great that she held on this long and 
didn’t give birth on the track!’

Asked to compare fatherhood to 
winning Olympic gold, he said: ‘It’s completely different. It’s out of 
your control.’ He added: ‘I’m very proud. To have three kids in the 
family is going to be exciting.’

Mo said they had yet to decide on names, but when they do, one would be inscribed on each of the medals.

He said: ‘Whatever one was born first gets the 10,000m and the other gets the 5,000m one.’

But when asked if he was dashing back to London to see them, he said:

‘No, no, no. I’ve got a race tomorrow, haven’t I?’

His mother-in-law Nadia Nell added: ‘We are all thrilled.'
