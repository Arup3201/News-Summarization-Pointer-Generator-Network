Lebanon's Miss Universe contestant has tried to distance herself from a controversial selfie of her with Miss Israel which led to calls for her to be stripped of her title.

Saly Greige, 25, has apologised for appearing in the photo and claims Miss Israel, Doron Matalon, 'jumped in' to take the photo before she could get out of the way.

Lebanon and Israel are at war, and Miss Greige, from Al-Koura, north Lebanon, claims she had done her best to avoid Miss Matalon at the pageant in Miami.

Under fire: Since the selfie emerged, there have been several calls for Miss Greige to be stripped of her Miss Lebanon title for 'consorting with the enemy'.

There have been several calls for Miss Greige to be stripped of her Miss Lebanon title over the picture, which shows her smiling awkwardly with Miss Matalon, Miss Japan and Miss Slovenia, but she claims it was not her fault.

In an apology on Facebook, the beauty queen wrote: 'Since the first day of my arrival to participate to Miss Universe, I was very cautious to avoid being in any photo or communication with Miss Israel (that tried several times to have a photo with me).

'I was having a photo with Miss Japan, Miss Slovenia and myself, suddenly Miss Israel jumped in, took a selfie, and put it on her social media.'

The offending photo appeared on Miss Matalon's Instagram account on January 11.

Miss Greige, who has a masters degree in civil engineering, can be seen smiling awkwardly in the photograph alongside Miss Japan and Miss Slovenia.

Lebanese media picked up the story, running Greige's allegations that Matalon had 'photobombed' the selfie, and local social media users both defended and attacked their beauty queen for the picture. 

In response to Miss Greige's apology, Miss Matalon said it made her sad that Miss Greige could not 'put the hostility out of the game'

After several calls for her to be stripped of her Miss Lebanon 2014 title, Miss Greige took to her Facebook page to declare that Miss Matalon had 'photobombed' her.

Miss Matalon responded to the controversy herself on Sunday, saying it made her 'sad'.

'It doesn't surprise me, but it still makes me sad. Too bad you can not put the hostility out of the game,' she wrote in English and Hebrew. 

Israel occupied parts of Lebanon for 22 years until 2000, but the two countries are still technically at war and their armies occasionally skirmish along the UN-designated withdrawal line.

Israel fought a bloody war against Lebanon's Hezbollah in 2006, which killed more than 1,200 people in Lebanon, mostly civilians, and some 160 Israelis, mostly soldiers.
