American children are safer being driven by their grandparents than by their parents, a new study has revealed.

Researchers admitted they were 'surprised' by the findings, which shows children involved in accidents in cars driven by their older relatives are 50 per cent less likely to be injured.

Previously, research has indicated that car crashes are more common in older drivers, mostly those aged over 65.

Dr. Fred Henretig, an emergency medicine specialist at Children's Hospital of Philadelphia and the study's lead author, said: 'We were surprised to discover that the injury rate was considerably lower in crashes where grandparents were the drivers.'

The surprising results came from an analysis of insurance claims for 2003-07 car crashes in 15 states, involving nearly 12,000 children up to 15 years old.

Only about 10 per cent of children in the study were driven by grandparents, but they suffered proportionately fewer injuries.

Overall, 1.05 per cent of kids were injured when riding with parents, versus 0.70 per cent of those riding with grandparents - a 33 per cent lower risk.

The difference was even more pronounced - 50 per cent - when the researchers took into account other things that could influence injury rates, including not using car seats, and older-model cars.

Dr Henretig, 64, said the study was prompted by his own experiences when his first grandchild was born three years ago.

'I found myself being very nervous on the occasions that we drove our granddaughter around and really wondered if anyone had ever looked at this before,' he said.

Reasons for the unexpected findings are uncertain, but the researchers have a theory.

'Perhaps grandparents are made more nervous about the task of driving with the "precious cargo" of their grandchildren and establish more cautious driving habits' to compensate for any age-related challenges,' they wrote.

Professor Joseph Schofer, a Northwestern University transport expert not involved in the research, noted that the average age of grandparents studied was 58.

'Grandparents today are not that old and don't fit the image of an impaired older driver,' he said.

'None of us should represent grandparents as kind of hobbling to the car on a walker.'

Despite their surprising record, grandparents did fare less well on one measure of safety.

Nearly all the children were in car seats or seat belts, but grandparents were slightly less likely to follow recommended practices, including rear-facing backseat car seats for infants and keeping youngsters out of the front seat.

But that did not seem to make any difference to injury rates. The study does not include data on deaths, but Dr Henretig said there were very few.

It also lacked information on the types of car trips involved; for example, driving in busy city traffic might increase chances for crashes with injuries.

Professor Schofer said other unstudied circumstances could have played a role.

For example, grandparents could be less distracted and less frazzled than busy parents dropping their kids off at school while rushing to get to work or to do errands.

Driving trips might be 'quality time' for older drivers and their grandchildren, he said.
