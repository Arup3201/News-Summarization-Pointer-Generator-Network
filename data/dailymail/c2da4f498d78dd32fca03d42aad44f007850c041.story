The New York City firefighter who was acquitted of strangling his pre-op transsexual girlfriend has a new love in his life â€“ a transgender woman who herself was cleared of a fatal strangulation charge.

FDNY firefighter Taylor Murphy, who is most well known for his steamy topless calendar shoot, was sensationally acquitted of strangling his pre-op girlfriend, Claudia Charriez.

Wanda Batista, 32, was acquitted of a jury in Brooklyn for the 2004 killing of her transsexual pimp, Paola Matos.

Murphy and Batista were seen at the trial for the FDNY firefighter last week arm in arm, according to the New York Post.

He was convicted of felony criminal 
contempt for the massive amounts of emails, texts, and calls he placed 
to Charriez, a violation of his parole.

Jurors threw out the 
felony strangulation charge, which carries a penalty of seven years 
jail, against Murphy and also cleared him of witness-tampering.

Transsexual Claudia Charriez, a 
former escort and contestant on television show America's Next Top 
Model, had accused her former lover of attacking her in a Midtown hotel 
in August last year.

He was also convicted by the Manhattan Supreme Court jury of a misdemeanor 
assault and of criminal mischief for smashing Miss Charriez's mobile phone.

The 29-year-old, who is dating 
transsexual Wanda Batista, has since spoken of his fear after someone scrawled
'f*****' on his fire department locker.

Mixed verdict: Murphy was cleared of a strangulation charge but convicted of assault and contempt

Cleared: Jurors threw out the most serious charge against Murphy, which carries a penalty of seven years jail.

Murphy, who admitted wanted to commit
suicide out of humiliation, believes he will be harassed if he stays in
the service, having been publicly outed as a bisexual who prefers the 
company of flashy transsexuals.

He told the Daily News: 'Once you do that, you're not part of the Fire Department. That's part of why I tried to kill myself.'

Murphy's lawyers had dismissed Miss 
Charriez, 31, as being jealous of her ex-boyfriend seeing other people, including
Miss Batista, and that the dispute in question was nothing more than a
lovers' quarrel.

The 6ft 4ins firefighter said: 'I wish the best for her. I wish she gets a sense of reality.'

Murphy also opened up about another 
former lover, Lorena Escalera, who was found dead in a New York building
following a fire.

He said he had blamed Miss Charriez for spreading 
rumours that he was involved in her death.

Miss Charriez - who was kicked off America's Next Top Model in 2006 for being born a man - had sobbed on 
the witness stand that she still loves Murphy and admitted, under questioning, to several inconsistencies in her report to police.

She also confessed to sending numerous
love-and-hate text messages to Murphy after the alleged beating - 
including telling him after his arrest: 'Enjoy sucking your cell mate's 
d***.'

Miss Charriez had claimed Murphy attacked her in a jealous rage after seeing her talking to men at the strip club Flash Dancers.
