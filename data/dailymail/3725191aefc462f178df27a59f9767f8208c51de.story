Thousands of rail travellers are being forced to pay double for their journeys to and from the stricken West Country as a major rail firm withdraws its ‘advance purchase’ discount tickets in the wake of storm damage chaos.

But First Great Western denies ‘profiteering’ and insists the action on services West of Exeter and some connected routes was unavoidable following storms which caused the line at Dawlish in Devon to collapse into the sea.

As another Atlantic storm sweeps in, Network Rail say it will take ‘at least six weeks’ to  re-open the Dawlish line.

This was the scene as waves whipped up by stormy weather crashed over the train tracks on Dawlish's seaside line. Thousands of rail travellers are being forced to pay double for their journeys to and from the stricken West Country

The ticket move emerged after regular peak-time travellers who book well ahead for a heavily discounted ‘Advance’ ticket on a specified train found they were unable to do so.

A full-price ‘Anytime’ single ticket from Penzance costs £142, while a pre-booked ‘Advance’ ticket may be half that. 

But First Great Western, which runs 1,500 services and carries around a quarter of a million passengers daily, said it had been forced to withdraw the discounted tickets because they applied to specific time-tabled trains.

And the engineering work to  repair and restore  the storm-lashed line at Dawlish means that they cannot guarantee which services will run.

So they have withdrawn the discounted book-ahead tickets until they can guarantee a ‘robust’ timetable, which is unlikely to be before next week.

One regular commuter who travels 
peak-time to London Paddington on a First Great Western service from 
Castle Cary in Somerset with the added benefit of a senior rail discount said: ‘I get an Advance Single ticket which costs me £27.85.

‘This
 morning I booked the same service for this coming Monday and found 
there were no Advance Single tickets available – it was only possible to
 buy a full fare ticket for £63.70.

‘Initially
 I  wondered whether for some reason there was heavy demand and I had 
simply left it late to book, but I checked prices for the next Monday – 
February  17 -  and it is the same. No Advance Single tickets available -
 only the full fare at £63.70. So effectively the fare has doubled.’

The full Anytime single- without the senior rate discount costs £96.50.

A
 First Great Western spokesman confirmed: ‘With damage to the rail 
infrastructure at Dawlish, we have had to temporarily suspend 
reservations. Put simply, we cannot sell a cheaper, time specific, 
reserved seat if we are unable to guarantee the delivery of that 
service. 

‘Once we have a 
full and robust train plan in place, to operate services west of Exeter 
we will  restart sales of Advance Purchase tickets.’

However,
 because the fares have to be updated in the national fares booking 
system ‘these may not be available until the early part of next week’.

With high tides combined with gale force winds and further heavy rain, some parts of the UK are bracing themselves for more flooding

He said: ’’The cost of our peak time and off peak fares has not altered since the Government's inflation-based fare increase in January. 

‘Within the last two weeks however, due to Network Rail maintenance work, and latterly due to substantial damage of the railway infrastructure at Dawlish, there has been amendments to the availability of reserved, Advance Purchase tickets.’

First Great Western  said that to help customers travel during the disruption it has  removed all ticket restrictions for travel West of Exeter: ‘This allows customers with existing Advance Purchase, or off-peak tickets, to travel on any available service including peak time trains for no extra cost.’

This does not however help those passengers who want to book ahead now for a  future  discounted  peak-time Advance  on a specified service. They will have to pay full fare if they want to ensure they can get onto a peak-time train.

But the rail firm did pledge to refund the tickets of anyone forced to pay full-price if a cheaper Advance  ticket subsequently becomes available:  ‘Should a customer buy an off peak fare, for example to travel next Thursday, and a cheaper Advance Purchase ticket become available on Tuesday or Wednesday, we will refund the cost of the off peak fare.'

He said: ‘We hope to have a robust train plan in place over the course of the weekend. Further  poor weather prevents us from doing this on Thursday of Friday. Once we have this, we can restart sales of Advance purchase tickets.’

Services from Castle Cary are affected because that train route runs down towards Exeter and beyond to the Dawlish area, he said.

Network Rail’s  route managing director for the Western route said: ‘We absolutely understand the importance of the railway to the South West and we will do everything we can to re-build the railway at Dawlish as quickly and safely as we can.’

Mike Hewitson, head of policy for consumer watchdog Passenger Focus said: ‘We appreciate the difficulties these storms have created for the rail industry. However, passengers wanting to travel to and from Devon and Cornwall are facing a double disadvantage

'Not only do they face the delay itself, but they also have to pay much more to travel than usual. With extreme weather become more frequent the industry needs to address this issue.’
