Almost destroyed and littered with unexploded bombs, it suffered some of the worst bombing of any airfield during the Battle of Britain and has a rich history of flight.

But Manston Airport, near Margate, Kent - where Dambusters ace Sir Barnes Wallace carried out tests on the revolutionary bouncing bomb during the Second World War - has been sold for just £1.

The location, which is now called Kent’s International Airport and operated from by Dutch airline KLM, was used in 1943 to test the bomb before it was used in the raid on Germany’s Ruhr valley.

Manston was regularly used by badly-damaged aeroplanes because it was so close to the front-line and had a long runway, becoming an emergency landing ground for bomber crews on the east coast.

There have been persistent rumours of a mutiny at Manston during the Battle of Britain, with claims that ground crew were so angered by constant attacks on the airfield that they lost their morale.

It has been suggested that the men refused to come out of their air raid shelter, and only emerged when threatened by an officer with a gun. However, claims of any mutiny have never been proven.

The airport, historically known as RAF Manston, has been bought from infrastructure investment firm Infratil by entrepreneur Ann Gloag, one of the co-founders of transport company Stagecoach.

The 71-year-old has set up a new firm to buy and operate the airfield - which has a mile-long runway, a terminal capable of handling five million passengers a year, and proposals for a London train link.

In May 16 1943, 19 aircraft set out to destroy three dams in the Ruhr valley - the Mohne, the Eder and the Sorpe - to damage a vital source of power to the key industrial area of Germany.

The Mohne and Eder Dams in the industrial heart of Germany were attacked and breached by mines dropped from specially modified Lancasters of 617 Squadron.

Using bouncing bombs, their night-time raid saw the mission hailed a success.

The Sorpe dam was was also attacked by two aircraft and damaged. A fourth dam, the Ennepe, was reported as being attacked by a single aircraft, but with no damage.

An estimated 1,294 people were killed by flood waters, but eight of the 19 aircraft that went on the mission failed to return. There was a loss of 53 aircrew - and three were taken as prisoners.

Mrs Gloag said: ‘I am delighted to have purchased Manston Airport from Infratil as I believe there is real potential for growth that has not been fully captured.

‘I have said for 25 years now that the airport will never really succeed until we have a one-hour link from London to Manston. That is achievable and on track.’

Infratil said the airport was being sold for a ‘cash
consideration of £1, plus an adjustment for working capital variances and cash
injected by Infratil’ - expected to be around £350,000.

The airfield’s buildings were destroyed during the Battle of Britain in 1940, three years before Sir Barnes used the base to test his bomb on the coast at Reculver prior to the Dambusters raid.

Thanet North Conservative MP Roger Gale said: ‘We now have a company taking over the airport that recognises its potential. I think the sale is very good news for those employed at Manston.’

Mrs Gloag scooped the Business Woman of the Year Award in 1990 for Stagecoach, a firm she and her 59-year-old brother Sir Brian Souter started with one bus in 1980.
