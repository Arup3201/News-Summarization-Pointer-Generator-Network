An Iraqi man who fled to America to escape the horrors of the Islamic State was shot dead as he took pictures of the first snowfall he had ever seen.

Ahmed Al-Jumaili, 36, and his new wife moved from Iraq to Dallas, Texas, 20 days ago to be near relatives and start married life in a 'safer place'.

But on Wednesday night, at 11.30pm, a group of men armed with rifles appeared outside the couple's apartment and opened fire, striking Al-Jumaili in the chest, police said. 

Authorities are investigating the possibility Al-Jumaili was the victim of a hate crime.

Wife: Al-Jumaili, his wife, Zahara (photographed), and Al-Jumaili's brother went outside of his Dallas apartment to take pictures of the snow around 11.30pm when tragedy struck

In a detailed account of the incident posted on Facebook by Alia Salem, executive director of the Council on American-Islamic Relations (CAIR) in the Dallas and Fort Worth area, described the attack.

Salem writes that Ahmed took cover behind a pickup truck when a group of five or six young African Americans opened fire.

A bullet pierced through the truck and struck Al-Jumaili in the chest, Salem said.

'There was nothing said to Ahmed or his wife and her brother by the perpetrators in advance of the shots,' Salem wrote. 'Including no verbal insults or derogatory slurs.'

Residents reported seeing two to four men entering the Walnut Blend Apartment complex on foot through a vehicle gate prior to the shooting, CNN reports. 

An investigation is ongoing and police say it is unknown whether the incident was a hate crime.

Refuge: Al-Jumaili (right) and Zahara (left) married just 16 months ago, and the two planned to move to the U.S., seeking refuge from the Islamic State

A LaunchGood fundraising page tells the touching story of Al-Jumaili and Zahara. The two married just 16 months ago, and planned to move to the U.S., seeking refuge from the Islamic State.

Zahara relocated to Texas to be with family and Al-Jumaili stayed behind in Baghdad to save enough money to follow his wife.

After a year of separation, the two reunited three weeks ago, ready to begin a new chapter in their lives, away from the horrors of ISIS and other terrorist groups, only to experience tragedy in America.

Salem wrote on Facebook that only Al-Jumaili's stepfather, who lives in Dallas, is working and Al-Jumaili's death has left Zahara with not only an emotional burden, but a financial one as well.

The fundraiser has raised more than $9,000 toward Al-Jumaili's memorial and family fund.

Police say they have very little to go on in the investigation and are enlisting the help of the public to solve the crime.  

North Texas Crime Stoppers is offering a reward of $5,000 for information leading to an arrest or indictment. 

The attack has some Muslim activists shaken up, the Los Angeles Times reports, with some pointing to the recent murder of three Muslim students in North Carolina. 

The neighborhood where Al-Jumaili was killed has a large immigration population, according to the Times, and northern Dallas is home to a large number of Iraqi refugees.
