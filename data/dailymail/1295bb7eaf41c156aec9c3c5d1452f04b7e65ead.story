One of Labour’s brightest rising stars has challenged Ed Miliband’s position on the private sector providing free NHS services, declaring: ‘What matters is what works’.

Liz Kendall, a Blairite shadow health minister who is increasingly tipped as a future party leader, struck a markedly different tone on NHS ‘privatisation’ to Mr Miliband and her immediate boss, Andy Burnham.

She also warned against Labour becoming ‘the moaning man in the pub’ and defended middle class voters with ‘sharp elbows’ who demand the best from public services.

Mr Miliband has accused the Government of ‘privatising and fragmenting the NHS’, though in fact there has been a much smaller rise in the number of NHS services provided by private sector providers under the coalition than there was under Labour.

Mr Burnham, meanwhile, has called for a moratorium on new contracts being signed and claimed the Government wants to let ‘the market… carry on ripping through the NHS’. 

The shadow health secretary has also insisted ‘the NHS as we know it won’t exist’ if the Conservatives remain in power.

But Miss Kendall, in an interview with political magazine The House, insisted: ‘There will remain a role for the private and voluntary sectors where they can add extra capacity to the NHS or challenges to the system.

'I believe what matters is what works. That’s what I’ve always believed in and I continue to believe in.’

She praised the privately-run independent treatment centres (ITSCs) first created by Tony Blair’s government, while she was an adviser in the Department of Health, which were credited with helping to cut NHS waiting times.

‘I remember when I worked in the Department of Health a very senior clinician saying “you’ve got one of these ISTCs down the road now so I’m going to have to talk to some of my GP colleagues about getting my waits down and stop doing so much private practice”.

‘So it did bring challenge to the system. It was the NHS – and the increased investment we put in the NHS – that delivered the vast majority of the reductions in the waits. But some challenge in the system was crucial to that.

‘I think we need real reforms of our public services, including the NHS and social care, in many different areas.’

She backed the idea of medical consultations by Skype and iPhone, insisting: ‘It is a disgrace how little we have used technology to transform people’s experience.

'This [she points to her iPhone] is part of my life now and that is how people increasingly expect to interact with the NHS.

‘Some people think “oh, it’s just some pushy middle class people wanting to get things from their doctor when and where they want”. I don’t think there’s anything wrong with making sure that our NHS needs to meet the needs and demands of middle class people or anybody else.’

Miss Kendall also suggested Labour needed to demonstrate how it would reform public services in an age of austerity.

‘Without doubt, post-financial crash, and the constraints in public spending that there rightfully has to be, it was very clear that the NHS needs to contribute to that as a whole,’ she said.

‘On the left we do have to show how we can deliver our goals of social justice and fairness when there’s less money around. But also because we need to make services work better for people.’

Asked whether she wanted to be Labour leader, the shadow minister said: ‘If anyone says anything nice about me it’s incredibly flattering. All I care about is winning on May 7. All I care about is getting Ed [Miliband] into Downing Street, full stop. That’s it.’

Labour has made the NHS central to its election campaign, issuing a poster claiming the health service ‘as you know it cannot survive five more years of David Cameron’ and claiming that public spending would be cut back to 1930s levels.

Tory MPs accuse the party of hypocrisy and shroud-waving, since expenditure on NHS services provided free of charge by private providers has risen at a slower rate since 2010 than in the four years before, when Labour was in power.

Overall, only around just six pence in every pound is spent in the NHS with the private sector, compared to around five pence under Labour.
