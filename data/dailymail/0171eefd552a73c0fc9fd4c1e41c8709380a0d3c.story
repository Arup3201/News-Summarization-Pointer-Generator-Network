Former investment banker: Lord Freud said many of the poor turned down jobs because they were worried about losing their handouts

Some of the poor are stuck on benefits because they are unwilling to take risks, the welfare minister claimed yesterday.

Lord Freud, a former investment banker, said many turned down jobs because they were worried about losing their handouts.

Describing the current system as ‘dreadful’, Lord Freud said his reforms would encourage the poor to take risks because they will ensure that, unlike at the moment, work always pays.

He added that the welfare system is so complicated that many claimants have no idea which benefits they would keep if they found work.

Many also lose so many benefits when they get a job that they end up being worse off, he said.

Lord Freud told The House magazine, which is circulated in Parliament, that this discouraged the poor from taking risks.

‘People who are poorer should be prepared to take the biggest risks; they’ve got least to lose,’ he said.

‘We have, through our welfare system, created a system which has made them reluctant to take risks so we need to turn that on its head and make the system predictable so that people will take those risks. I think we have a dreadful welfare system.’

He said that the new Universal Credit 
payment will simplify the system and ensure those who decide to take a 
job do not lose out financially.

Lord Freud went on: ‘What we’ve got today is a welfare system that is so complicated, with so many odd, unexpected effects, and so difficult for individuals to predict what will happen if they change their circumstances in some way, that it is really dangerous.

‘It’s dangerous because if you don’t know how the system will adjust when you change, go to work for instance, it freezes people in immobility.’

The current system encourages people to ‘have a lifestyle off benefits’, he said.

Lord Freud defended plans to put a cap on the amount of money a family can have on benefits.

‘The point about the benefit cap is it is making a statement about what are the limits of a welfare system,’ he said.

‘It’s saying that people should not get more by living on welfare than the average person in the country gets from earnings, so it’s a very basic statement around fairness.’

He added: ‘The welfare system is there to support people back to independence; it is not there as a lifestyle choice.’

Challenged over whether he could ever understand the life of a poor person when he earned a fortune as an investment banker, he replied: ‘I think you don’t have to be the corpse to go to a funeral, which is the implied criticism there.’
