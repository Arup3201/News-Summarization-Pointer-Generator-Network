Model Ginta Lapina has filed a lawsuit claiming that hair care company Schwarzkopf and her agency, Women Management, misled her into doing an advertising campaign, telling her the shoot was for Karl Lagerfeld.

The 25-year-old, who has starred in campaigns for Anna Sui, DKNY and Jill Stuart, says she flew to Paris in July 2013 for what she was told was a photo shoot by Mr Lagerfeld that would accompany an interview with the legendary designer.

She was surprised to discover that the images were actually used in an advertorial, and is seeking more than $1 million in damages as well as a court order prohibiting Schwarzkopf from using her pictures.

She also alleges that Women Management arranged the deal with 
Schwarzkopf without her knowledge or consent, and that she was paid 
$19,700 for her time, but not compensated for the use of her images.

'The Schwarzkopf Look 2014 Trends advertorial was NOT [billed as] an advertising campaign, and therefore, the models were compensated only for their time for the photo shoot but not for the usage of their image,' says the suit, filed in Manhattan Federal Court.

The Chanel creative director, who often shoots his own campaigns, did photograph the advertorial, which appears on Schwarzkopf's website.

Status update: Ms Lapina, pictured in the advertorial (right), says the deal has 'diluted' her brand, because Schwarzkopf is not of her caliber

The Latvian-born model, who married 49-year-old businessman Adam Hock in 2012, says she is accustomed to being solicited for campaigns by clients 'willing to pay a model a high-six figure sum.’

Furthermore, the deal has 'diluted' her brand, because 'Schwarzkopf products and look of advertisement are not of the caliber normally endorsed by a model of plaintiff Ginta's stature in the industry.'

'In sum, Defendants conspired to obtain a top model for an advertising campaign without having to pay the usual and customary compensation that a top model commands,' claims the suit.

The suit also notes that Models.com ranked Ms Lapina 27th in a list of the highest-earning models this year.

Women CEO Sergio Leccese told the New York Daily News that he was 'surprised and disappointed' by the suit, adding: 'We deny any and all allegations of wrongdoing and intend to seek all appropriate remedies in connection with these issues.'

MailOnline's request to Schwarzkopf for comment was not immediately answered.
