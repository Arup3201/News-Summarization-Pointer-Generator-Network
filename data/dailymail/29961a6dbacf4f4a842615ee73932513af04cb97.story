Clutching a brimming glass, at 9.21am yesterday he became the first customer to be poured a pint at a motorway service station pub.

Tom, 37, a businessman who declined to give his surname, had stopped off at The Hope and Champion at junction 2 of the M40 to claim the first pint at the controversial pub, which can serve alcohol from 9am.

But he confessed that he thought the idea was ‘completely ridiculous’ and did not finish his London Pride beer before driving off.

'I don't normally have a pint at nine in the morning.

First to the bar: Tom from Beaconsfield was the first customer to have a pint at the pub this morning at 9.21am

'It is ok for the truckers, the local pubs round here get lots of truckers but I think 9am at a service station is a bit silly,' the businessman said.

Road safety charity Brake called service station pubs ‘a dangerous temptation’ for motorists, but many of the first customers dismissed concerns.

Mike Murchland, an automotive analyst on his way from Oxford to Heathrow airport for a business flight to Sweden, was first through the door at 5.15am.

'I stopped here because it is a bit different, the services here already has more places than you can eat at in a week but it is nice to sit down and catch up on emails,' he said.

'I don’t have a problem with it being a pub, I think you’d have to be pretty desperate to come to a motorway service station for a drink - I can think of easier places,' said the father-of-two as he enjoyed an alcohol-free breakfast.

Sue Higgins, a solicitor also tucking into breakfast, pointed out that shops at the services at Beaconsfield, Buckinghamshire, sold alcohol. ‘I don’t see any problem at all,’ she said.

‘You can buy a drink at all the other
 places. This is just more civilised,' adding: 'If people can’t control 
their drinking habits that’s there own problem.'

Another customer at the pub on the M40 this morning. Though most patrons saw no problem with the pub, many believed motorists would go elsewhere to drink

A spokesman for the pub owned by JD Wetherspoon said they expected only 25 per cent of sales to be from alcoholic drinks

In a survey by the RAC, 64 per cent of people opposed pubs in service 
stations, but Iain Bruce, a 55-year-old construction worker eating at 
The Hope And Champion, noted that there were plenty of pubs on A roads.

‘If there is a group of you travelling and a couple want a pint then that is fine as passengers,’ he said.

The
 pub, which is owned by the JD Wetherspoon chain, is open from 4am until
 1am seven days a week and is licensed to sell alcohol from 9am.

Unlike other Wetherspoons, it does not advertise alcohol drinks promotions at the bar, and displays responsible drinking campaigns in its reception.

Iain Bruce, aged 55 years, said: “I don’t think a lot of people will use it for drinking. You drive past a lot of pubs on A roads and it is no different.

Eddie Gershon, spokesman for the company, said: 'We are a responsible pub operator and won’t serve anyone who has had more than they should have to drink.

'Within 50 metres of here you can go to Marks and Spencer and buy alcohol, or go on to any motorway having drunk at home, or go to a pub 200 metres off most motorways.

Mr Gershon said the pub’s trade is expected to be 25 per cent alcoholic drinks, compared to 65 per cent in high street branches, and added that no alcoholic drinks were promoted at the bar.

'We primarily believe the pub will be a place where people come to eat.

'If you run pubs well and in a responsible manner then people act accordingly.'

Karen Gunes, who helps businessmen moving from abroad to the UK to relocatean said: 'It won’t make a difference, the type of people who stop her would probably rather drink elsewhere.'

A total of 120 jobs have been created by the development of the £1.8million outlet which is next to Junction 2 on the M40 motorway.
