Oscar Pistorius is back at the track for the first time since he killed his model girlfriend on Valentine's Day two months ago.

The Olympian is pictured with his hands on his hips wearing his blades as he walks across a running track as his agent said his return to training was imminent.

Pistorius, 26, is keen to begin training again - just weeks after he appeared weeping in court charged with the death of Reeva Steenkamp and despite facing a murder trial.

The Beeld newspaper showed a photo of the athlete on the running track - nearly three months after he shot his girlfriend dead

The Afrikaans-language Beeld newspaper printed the image of what it said was Pistorius on the front page of its Thursday edition.

In the photograph, the double amputee is seen from some distance wearing his blades and dark lycra running clothes and is walking on a track with his hands on his hips.

The newspaper said the photo was taken on March 24 by a high school student visiting the University of Pretoria, where Pistorius' regular practice facility is.

It was the first time Pistorius had put his blades on since he shot dead Steenkamp in his home his agent, Peet van Zyl, said, but it was not a training session.

Pistorius was only 'having a jog 
around the track,' the agent said, as the newspaper claimed sources had 
told it the Olympic 400-meter runner and Paralympic champion had begun 
full training on March 21.

Mr
Van Zyl disputed that and said neither he nor Ampie Louw, Pistorius' 
coach and the man who controls his training sessions, were present at 
the track on the day the photograph was taken.

Reeva Steenkamp, girlfriend of South Africa's Olympic sprint star Oscar Pistorius, was shot dead by the athlete on Valentine's Day

The single photo, a grainy image taken through a metal fence showing Pistorius walking on the far side of the track, was accompanied by a front-page story under the headlines 'Oscar is back on the track' and 'In training with other athletes.'

But while Pistorius wasn't yet in a training routine, his return could be any day now, his agent said.

'He was just having a jog around his track on his own accord. He wasn't back at training,' Mr Van Zyl said.
'That picture was taken by a schoolkid on March 24. Myself, Oscar and 
his coach had a meeting on Tuesday to discuss him getting him back to 
training.

'Based on that he told us he would like to get back in training and we can now look at formulating his training schedule.

'He is finding it very difficult and 
he is still coming to terms with the sad loss of Reeva. That is why it 
will be better for him to be back at training. It will be great to get 
him back to the track and get some routine. That's why we are taking it 
day by day.'

While a return to training might be 
on the cards for Pistorius, who holds several IPC World Championship 
titles over 200 metres, 400m and 4x400m, Van Zyl revealed there is 
currently no plan regarding his competitive return, if he is invited to 
compete.

Pistorius appeared at the Magistrates Court in Pretoria and is set to face a murder trial - an accusation he strongly denies

The athlete, who claims he mistook his girlfriend for an intruder, is reportedly keen to begin training

'We haven't even spoken to him or contemplated him running in a competition,' Van Zyl said.

'He has got to be able to train first
and be in some decent form as a world-class athlete before we would 
allow him to run in a competition.

'If he trains well and his mindset is
right then by all means we will look at competitions and options. When 
that will be we don't know. It could happen quickly or it could take a 
year.

'But at the moment, there is no specific date when it comes to him returning to training.

'In the current state he is in he 
might get up tomorrow and give the coach a phone call and say he might 
want to train again. He then might not want to train for a few days.

'We are not going to force him. We are going to be guided by him.'

Pistorius' family said: 'Oscar is not back on any official training programme.

'This may change
in future, but this will be a decision taken by Oscar, and Oscar alone. At this
point Oscar is still in an extremely traumatized state and has made it clear to
all of us that he is not able or willing to even contemplate this issue at this
stage.

'We can confirm that we did have a meeting with Oscar
yesterday where various family members and his trainer were present.

'We all
encouraged him to get back onto the track to help stabilise him emotionally.

'Oscar has been out running on a number of isolated occasions in the
days following the relaxation of his bail conditions, but each time has been
very difficult and he has "struggled immensely" with the decision to
even leave the house.

'As a family however we encourage him to start exercising as we believe
it is a vital step in helping him deal with the trauma.'

Mr Van Zyl insisted Pistorius' desire to start training again did not show disrespect to the family of Steenkamp.

'I can't see there would be any people saying this is disrespectful. This is not disrespectful to Reeva or her family.

'This has been part of his life for 
so many years. If it makes things easier for him to work through it and 
get some sense back into his life, let him run and let him jog.

'He's a human being and that's maybe an outlet for him.'

Pistorius denies murder in the Valentine's Day killing of model Steenkamp, saying he mistook her for a nighttime intruder in his home.

His next scheduled court appearance is June 4, when prosecutors say they intend to serve indictments.

The athlete is free to compete in Britain this summer after a judge relaxed his bail terms in March to allow him to make money.

It is certain to prove controversial as  it potentially paves the way for Pistorius, one of the world’s most successful athletes, to earn vast sums of money while he  is awaiting trial.

Although charged with murder, Pistorius has not been convicted of any crime and would be allowed to enter Britain by the Home Office.
