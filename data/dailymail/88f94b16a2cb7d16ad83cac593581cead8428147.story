Onlookers were given a rare insight into the packing arrangements of the royal family when their luggage was spotted being carried off the plane in Sydney.

And in true royal style it looks like William at least might have his very own monogrammed set of suit carriers, as a member of airport staff was seen holding a set emblazoned with the red letter W and a regal crown.

Marking the start of their Royal Tour of Australia, William and Kate visited the Sydney Opera House as their new nanny looked after eight-month-old Prince George.

But before embarking on Royal duties, a 
porter carried the couple's luggage off the plane, which included several navy suit carriers

The protective covers 
featured bright red 'W's, likely to be for William, and colour-coded red luggage tags.

According to popsugar.com, the Royal couple favour an organised luggage tag system (a color for each family member - George gets blue) specifying where each piece of luggage goes.

Reportedly Prince William's luggage typically has his monogram on it, while Kate's is an assortment.

The eight-month-old third in tine to the throne even had personal labels 'HRH Prince George of Cambridge#

The royal couple were greeted by a 
loud cheer from hundreds of fans as they posed in front of the Sydney 
Opera House and Sydney Harbour Bridge.

The

 Duchess paid homage to Australia in a wattle yellow SS14 Roksanda 
Ilincic Ryedale wool-crepe dress, worth Â£950, as the pair attended a 
reception at the famous Opera House.

The late afternoon light catching her
 hair and a light breeze whipping at her dress, Kate turned on an 
enormous smile at the crowd below as she and the Duke waved and then 
descended the Opera House steps following the reception inside the 
building.

Earlier in the afternoon eight-month-old Prince George was the star of the show when the family touched down in Sydney.

Carried
 off an Air Force jet by his mother, a line-up of dignitaries, including
 the country's Prime Minister Tony Abbott, couldn't wait to coo over the
 third in line to the throne.

The family arrived for their long-awaited trip at 2.25pm, with the doors to their plane opening at 2.35pm sharp.

The royal couple travelled by motorcade from Sydney Airport and arrived at the Opera House's western entrance where they were met by the NSW Governor Marie Bashir, her husband Sir Nicholas Shehadie and Mr Harwin.

Prince George did not accompany his parents to the Sydney Opera House reception and was instead cared for by his nanny, 43-year-old Maria Teresa Turrion Borrallo.

The couple was given two cricket bats decorated by a local Aboriginal artist and a tiny one for George.

'How sweet,' William said when Kate showed it to him.

They were also handed a green Cricket Australia cap with an HRH Prince George monogram stitched in yellow on the back.
