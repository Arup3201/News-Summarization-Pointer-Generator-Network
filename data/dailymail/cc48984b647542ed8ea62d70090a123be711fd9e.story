The easiest way to lose weight isn't willpower but to take away temptation, according to a new study.

Research shows that the best way to avoid temptation is not to face it in the first place.

In the case of dieters, this means not buying chocolate biscuits, rather than trying to resist raiding the biscuit tin.

The study found that the most impulsive people benefited the most from avoiding temptation, or ¿pre-committing¿, as it is known to scientists

Those who are strapped for cash might do well to put their money in a savings account with stiff penalties for early withdrawals.

Similarly, cutting up a credit card will likely do more for bank balance than simply trying not to use plastic.

The advice follows Cambridge University research into how easy people find it to give into temptation.

A group of men were given the choice of looking at a ‘mildly enjoyable’ erotic picture straight away or waiting for an image that would be ‘extremely enjoyable’. Sometimes, they had to exert their willpower to wait for the second picture.

Other times, they made their choice at the beginning and the instant temptation was taken away from those who said they’d rather wait. When this was the case, more men viewed the second image.

The study also found that the most impulsive people benefited the most from avoiding temptation, or ‘pre-committing’, as it is known to scientists.

Researcher Molly Crockett said that willpower is not the only form of self-control and anticipating problems also helps.

Dr Crockett, who worked with German researchers on the project, said: ‘Our study suggests that the most effective way to beat temptations is to avoid facing them in the first place.

‘It confirms in the lab what we knew all along intuitively, which is that removing temptation from your choice base is a really effective way of reaching your long-term goals.

‘If you are on a diet, don’t buy sweets at the store because if they are in the house, right in front of you, you are not going to be able to resist them.’ 

Dr Crockett, who resists temptation by using a computer programme that stops her from browsing the internet while she is working, admitted that many people will find the advice hard to follow.

She said: ‘People really like to have a choice and pre-commitment over-rides your preference to keep your options open.

‘Maybe one way to encourage people to pre-commit is to emphasise the benefits of achieving their long-term goal.’ 

The study, published in the journal Neuron, also shed light on the brain regions involved in the different aspects of self-control.

Professor Jason Halford, chairman of the UK Association for the Study of Obesity, said: ‘If you know what situations causes you problem, then avoiding it is a useful way of changing your behaviour. 

‘As the study shows willpower alone is clearly not a superior strategy. Indeed in situations of temptation or stress it may set individual up for failure.’ 

However, he added that having someone else set the rules by, for example, denying certain foods, could be a source of arguments.
