Gap, Sony Store and Toys 'R' Us have been revealed as three of the worst large  online retailers for customer satisfaction during the holiday season.

But Amazon, Apple and J.C. Penney were in the top five of 40 retailers, with the latter being the second most-improved of all on a previous poll.

Netflix experienced the biggest decline in satisfaction after it tried to raise prices and split its DVD and video-streaming services, the survey found.

Going up: The average customer satisfaction score for the ForSee index has risen from 74 to 79 since 2005, with 80 seen as the 'standard for excellence'

‘Netflix totally misread its customer base and is paying the price, damaging its brand among consumers and investors,’ ForeSee's Larry Freed said.

Surplus merchandise retailer Overstock came last out of the online shops, while electronics store Buy was also in the bottom five.

However beauty retailer Avon and home shopping channel QVC were in the top five, while printing firm VistaPrint was just outside in sixth place.

Customer satisfaction is important for retailers because it can lead to higher sales, more loyalty and increased word-of-mouth recommendations.

Netflix’s plan to increase prices and break up its DVD and video-streaming services was scrapped after angry customers defected.

Its shares lost more than half their value this year, with most damage coming after the company unveiled its service-splitting intention.

‘Customer satisfaction is predictive, which means that Netflix’s financial woes may be just beginning,’ Mr Freed added.

Netflix had come close in previous ForeSee surveys to leader Amazon, which topped the poll for the 14th consecutive time.

Huge company: Amazon, based in Seattle, Washington, has grown significantly since it was founded in 1995 and its global fulfilment centres cover 26 million sq ft

ForeSee, based in Michigan, runs the poll about every six months. The biggest gainer was technology gadget and parts website TigerDirect.

Amazon, based in Seattle, Washington, has grown significantly since it was founded in 1995 and its global fulfilment centres cover 26 million sq ft.

‘It now competes in almost every significant retail category and it is setting the bar very high for any company selling online,’ Mr Freed said.

‘It’s tough for a smaller retailer to compete with this level of dedication to providing an excellent customer experience.’

The average customer satisfaction score for the ForeSee index has risen from 74 to 79 since 2005, with 80 seen as the ‘standard for excellence’.
