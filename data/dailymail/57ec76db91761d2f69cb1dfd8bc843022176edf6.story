It might not be the most obvious choice for a wedding meal.

But when Julie Hansford and Paul Young wanted a slice of wedding life, they knew exactly where to go.

The couple, from Blandford, Dorset, celebrated their wedding day by holding their reception at Pizza Hut.

Hitched at the hut! Julie Hansford, 50, and Paul Young, 49, held their wedding reception at a Pizza Hut restaurant in Salisbury. The couple had their first date at the venue

A piece of happiness: Mr and Mrs Young, who met 14 years ago, celebrated the special day with 80 guests. The restaurant was decorated for the occasion

The newly-weds - who even had a pizza-themed wedding cake - picked the venue in Salisbury after having their first date in the same restaurant 14 years earlier.

Mrs Young, a housewife, said: 'It was really my idea. It
 actually only started as a joke when I said to Paul 'one day we will 
get married in that church and have our reception at Pizza Hut in 
Salisbury'.

'Once
 we started thinking about it more, it seemed like a really good idea - 
something fun and original that we'd always remember.'

Mr and Mrs Young exchanged their vows at 
St Michael and All Angels church in Coombe Bisset, Wiltshire, before 
heading over to the restaurant.

There, the happy couple dined on deep pan with 80 other guests.

To make the event extra special, staff dressed up for the occasion and made a
 pizza-shaped wedding cake with a ‘pepperoni’ heart on top.

The couple met at a mutual friend’s engagement party in March 2000 and went to the Salisbury restaurant for the first time a few weeks later.

They visited the the restaurant several times in the early part of their relationship.

Mrs Young said: 'Some of our very first dates and most memorable times together in those early years were spent at the Salisbury Pizza Hut restaurant.

'It was our favourite place to eat and we still go there every few months.'

Mr Young, who works in customer service, proposed to his wife four years later. They announced their engagement at his 40th birthday party.

The Youngs are not the only couple to tie the knot in a fast-food restaurant.

In July last year, Steven Asher and Emily Marshall held their reception at a McDonald's in Bristol.

Mrs Young said: 'Married life is fantastic – we’re still both buzzing.'

For their honeymoon,  the couple are heading off on a cruise to the Canary Islands. 

Lovin' it: Steven Asher and Emily Marshall were another couple to celebrate their wedding day at a fast food chain. The couple had their bash at a McDonald's in Bristol, after having many happy dates there
