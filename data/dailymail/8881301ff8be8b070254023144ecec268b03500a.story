Scam: Anne Manger, 55, carried out the fraud so she did not have to lay off her staff in Oakham, Leicestershire

An 'exemplary' postmistress who stole £114,000 to keep her struggling branch afloat after a lifetime working for the Royal Mail has been jailed.

Anne Manger, 55, whose father was a postmaster, was a well-respected member of the community but turned to fraud when money worries hit in January 2010.

She struggled to pay her daily bills and rather than lay staff off or admit the business was struggling she began to generate false cash credits and pocketed more than £100,000.

She covered her tracks by sharing the debt she created out between a number of the branch's outreach services.

A court heard that she even kept her crime secret from her husband because she wanted to protect his reputation.

But her scam was foiled when a routine audit found £113,872 missing from the accounts.

Manger, who ran the post office in Oakham, Leicestershire, admitted fraud and was jailed for 16 months at Leicester Crown Court.

Judge Robert Brown told her she had committed a 'significant breach of trust'.

He said: 'Many in the community speak well of you and your family, who support you through this.

'It's such a large sum, over a long period of time, it's too serious not to mark it with a custodial sentence.'

Michael Garvey, mitigating, said: 'She's been employed by the Post Office all her working life, and her father before her.

'She's previously run post offices in various locations in an exemplary fashion.

'Oakham Post Office needed building up when she and her husband first moved there and she started an outreach branch, going to villages so those who had lost their post offices would have some service.

'They were hit, as every business in the country was, by the recession.

Fraud: The post office in Oakham got into financial difficulties in 2010 and the respected boss Anne Manger turned to crime to cover their losses

Guilty plea: Manger and her husband have sold their home to pay back the money which was taken

'Extremely difficult circumstances arose and over a three-year period, the money went purely on living expenses and making sure the premises could stay open.

'She didn't want to lay off any staff and she was working more than 60 hours a week.

'They didn't have a lavish lifestyle and hadn't been taking holidays or buying cars beyond their means.

'She knew from the outset she would be found out and it was a weight off her shoulders.'

The Mangers, who ran the post office together for six years, have now been forced to sell their £150,000 home to pay back the stolen money.

A Post Office spokesman said: 'We believe that all sub-postmasters hold a unique position of trust.

'The overwhelming majority of people who work in our branch network are professional, honest and provide the highest standards of service possible and so it is always disappointing when that trust is breached.'
