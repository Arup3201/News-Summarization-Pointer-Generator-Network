Any mother with a teething child will know that anything and everything becomes a target for a baby's gnawing gums - especially the jewellery dangling temptingly within their grasp.

But not only does that mean your favourite beads becoming covered in a fine layer of drool and tiny tooth imprints, but beads can be dangerous for babies to put in their mouths, whether because they are covered in toxic paint, easily breakable or sharp.

Now one company Gumigem is aiming to tackle this problem by creating a range of fashion jewellery mothers will actually be keen to wear - but that babies can use to soothe their painful gums.

Gumigem allows mothers to keep following fashions while also removing the worry that their little one will put something dangerous in their mouths

All Gumigem pieces are made of non toxic siilcone that is free from lead, latex, BPAs, PVC and phthalates

Kerry Katona and Nell McAndrew have spoken out about their love for the product

The aim is that mothers should still be able to look fashionable while wearing something that baby can safely get their teeth into (literally).

Started by Jenny McLaughlan, 37, from Dundee, Gumigem already has a celebrity following, with the Daily Record reporting that Sienna Miller, Nell McAndrew, Coleen Rooney and Kerry Katona are fans.

Jenny, mother to Maisie, five, and Miller, three, came up with the concept for Gumigem when Miller was teething.

The products are simple and elegant, but most importantly safe for baby

Jenny said: ‘Miller was a nightmare 
teether. There were times I would strap teething rings to my neck so I 
always had something to hand.

‘Then it struck me that I could come up with something that looked good and doubled as a teether.’

Some babies are born with their first teeth, others start teething before they are four months old, and some after 12 months.

Early teething should not cause a child any problems, unless it affects their feeding.

You may notice that the gum is sore and red where the tooth is coming through, or that one cheek is flushed.

Your baby may dribble, gnaw and chew a lot, or just be fretful.

As well as giving safe things to chew, cool drinks, sugar-free teething gel and infant painkillers can help.

If you baby is dribbling a lot, be sure to wipe their face often to prevent a rash.

Some people attribute a wide range of symptoms to teething, such as diarrhoea and fever, however, there is no research to prove that these other symptoms are linked.

Originally
working on the company in her spare time, Jenny has now left her job in
the pharmaceutical industry to focus on the company, along with her 
husband Stuart, 44.

The pieces, which cost from £8.95 for a bangle, are simple but elegant and include pendants, beaded necklaces, bangles and even dog tags for men.

As
well as allowing mothers to continue accessorising during their child's
teething, wearing the teether means there is always something available
for the baby to chew on.

In
addition to easing discomfort, chewing while teething is beneficial as it helps the new teeth erupt.

The dishwasher-safe necklaces, which are made of non toxic silicone that is 
free from lead, latex, BPAs, PVC and phthalates, all feature a breakaway clasp so they come away if baby pulls rather than hurting the wearer.

Silicone is ideal for the pieces as it is odourless, tasteless and will not support the growth of bacteria or mould.

Gemigum stress on their website that the necklaces are only intended for an adult to wear and children must only have access to it when worn by an adult.

However, the bangles can be left with the child unattended.
