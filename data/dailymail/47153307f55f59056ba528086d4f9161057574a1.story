When it comes to seeing the Northern Lights, it's all about getting the best view. And a luxury igloo-style hotel in Finland is offering guests the perfect way to glimpse the stunning aurora borealis.

The Kakslauttanen Hotel & Igloo Village, in Saariselkä, can enjoy the display surrounded by all the creature comforts of home in one of their specially-designed snow or glass igloos.

Each igloo, which can cost up to £240 a night, is fitted with beds for two people, a bathroom, and - best of all - a personal sauna.

Also onsite is the world's biggest snow restaurant, where tables are made of ice, and the world's largest smoke sauna.

Showers are available in separate buildings, with separate facilities for men and women.

A spokesman for the resort said: 'From inside the glass igloos, you can admire the Northern Lights and the twinkling of the bright, starry sky with your loved one.

'The best part is that it's all from the comforting warmth of room temperature.'

The glass igloos are available right through the Northern Lights season - from the third week of August until April.

'A night in one of our snow igloos is an unforgettable experience,' the spokesperson added.

'Rarely does anyone get the chance to sleep as cosily as they do in an ice-cool igloo that shields them from even the faintest outside noise.'

'Even if the mercury dips to minus 40 degrees centigrade outside, the temperature inside is a consistent minus three to minus six.'

Hotel pricing starts from £50 per night.
