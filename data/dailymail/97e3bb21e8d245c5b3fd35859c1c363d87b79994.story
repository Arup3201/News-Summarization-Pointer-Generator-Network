With the polls already open in some battleground states, and just seven days left on the calendar until Election Day, a new survey shows that Americans remain unhappy with the Democratic president and the direction he is taking the country in.

In the latest ABC News/Washington Post poll Americans again gave Obama an approval rating, and seven in 10 said they believe the country is on the wrong track.

One of the only positive nuggets of news for the president and his party in the new survey is that half of Americans said their vote in the midterms would not be a reflection of their feelings about the president. That bodes well for embattled Democrats whose Republican challengers have promoted their candidacies as referendum on the sinking president.

Upside for Democrats: Half of Americans said their vote in the midterms would not be a reflection of their feelings about the president

Just seven in 10 Americans say they believe the country is on the wrong track - that doesn't bode well for Democrats competing in next Tuesday's midterm elections

Still, twice as many respondents, 31 percent, said their vote would be to show opposition to Obama than those who said it would be to make a statement of support, 16 percent.

And 63 percent say the government's ability to deal with the nation's problems has gotten worse. Americans who feel that way favor Republicans to come in and save the day by nearly a three to one margin.

Democrats hoping for an October Surprise or some other Hail Mary are unlikely to get one at this point in race. With just a week left to go until Election Day, it's all about turnout now. 

ABC News' survey shows that even though voters expect Republicans to take control of Congress, Democrats still have a shot if they can turn out their supporters to the polls.

Among likely voters, the GOP has a six-point advantage going into next Tuesday's elections. But when all registered voters are taken into account, it's Democrats who have the edge. 

Registered voters said they prefer the Democratic candidate in their congressional district to Republican one, 47-44 That's compared to likely voters, who said they plan to cast a ballot for the GOP candidate next week by a margin of 50-44.

Not helpful: Obama's underwater approval rating may also hurt Democratic candidates at the polls next week

Whether or not Democrats will be able to mobilize their supporters in the next several days is make or break for the party, which is in danger of losing nine Senate seats currently held by Democrats to the Republican Party. 

If endangered Republicans are able to fend off their Democratic challengers in three key states and the party as a whole is able to pick off three additional Democrats, that's the ball game for the president's party during his final two years in office.

Obama's only means of recourse will be to use his vaunted pen and phone to issue vetoes of Republican-passed legislation.

While a Republican-controlled legislative branch would theoretically be game changer for federal policymaking, a large segment of likely voters, 31 percent, believe the change-up will make no difference.

Another 28 percent of the survey-takers told ABC News and Washington Post's pollsters they think Republican leadership of the Senate will be bad for the country. A plurality, 39 percent, said they thought the GOP would do a good job.
