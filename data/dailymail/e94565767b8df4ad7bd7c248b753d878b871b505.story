Algeria are through to the knockout stages of the World Cup for the very first time, so many fans will be unfamiliar with the history of the north African nation.

Here, TOM RODDY helps shine a light on Algeria's colourful past and present ahead of their last-16 clash against Germany. Speaking of the Germans, this could prove to be a feisty clash. Read on to find out why...

Star: Algeria striker Sofiane Feghouli will lead the line against Germany in the last 16 of the World Cup

1 Algeria's first opponents at the 1982 World Cup in Spain were none other than European Champions West Germany, who boasted a squad with the likes of Paul Breitner, Lothar Matthaus, Hansi Muller and Karl-Heinz Rummenigge. The result was far from what was expected. Algeria played vibrant football, shocking the Germans with a 2-1 victory. 

2 The 1982 finals began with joy but ended in controversial despair for Algeria. With West Germany and Austria’s match set to be played after the Algerians' final group game, the two sides knew a 1-0 win for the Germans would put both through, and the Algerians would be eliminated on goal difference. 

Unsurprisingly, that was exactly what happened. The match has become known in Germany as the 'non-aggression pact of Gijon' and rather less favourably in Algeria as the Anschluss. 

It led to a change in scheduling for the final group games, beginning at the 1986 finals in Mexico, FIFA ordered the final games of the group to be played simultaneously to avoid a repeat of the match in Gijon.

3 Algeria’s only goal in the 1986 finals in Mexico came from one Djamel Zidane, uncle of France legend Zinedine Zidane. Djamel featured in the impressive campaign in 1982 as well.

Now assistant to Carlo Ancelotti at Real Madrid, Zizou’s parents originated from Algeria but migrated to France in the 1950s. A supposed friendly fixture between the two countries in October 2001 ended in acrimony. Zidane received death threats prior to the game and was taunted throughout. The tie was eventually abandoned due to a pitch invasion by young French-Arabs.

4 Algeria’s impressive performance in Brazil this summer contrasts dramatically to their dismal campaign in South Africa four years ago. In a group with England, USA and Slovenia, Algeria were soon on their way home with one solitary point from a bore-draw with England, and without scoring a single goal.

In fact, Sofiane Feghouli’s penalty in the twenty-fourth minute against Belgium this month was Algeria’s first goal at a World Cup in twenty-eight years.

5 One of the stars of the 1982 World Cup was Lakhdar Belloumi, scorer of the winning goal against West Germany. Belloumi had received praise from Pele and was supposed to be on his way to Juventus in 1985, a team which included the great Michel Platini. The move ended up falling apart when the striker broke his leg in the African Champions’ Cup.

6 Along with nine other players, Rachid Mekhloufi left his successful career in France with Saint Etienne in 1958 to take part in the first squad of the Algerian National Liberation Front, which sought independence from the French. Technically, Mekhloufi and co were playing for a country which did not exist. But regardless of the chaos in Algeria, the team continued to play and in 1962 Algeria was officially declared independent from France with a national football programme created. Who said football was just a game?

7 It is believed that Sofiane Feghouli was a transfer target for Liverpool in 2013 and Manchester United in 2012. The forward is currently playing in La Liga with Valencia and assisted eight goals in the 2013/14 season.

8 As a youngster, Islam Slimani would often go fishing using a plastic bottle tied to several pieces of string because he could not afford either a rod or net. Slimani, Algeria’s top goalscorer in Brazil this summer, netted against Russia on Thursday to knock out Fabio Capello’s side from the World Cup.

9 Former Real Madrid star Zinedine Zidane has shown his support for Algeria. He said, ‘Algeria has always been in my heart. They (France and Algeria) are the two teams that I have always supported and that I want to see win.

10 Vahid Halilhodzic won the Champions League in 1997 - the African Champions League that is, with Morocco's Raja Casablanca.

Halilhodzic has also been known to speak about himself in the third person. He once informed his critical press that he had three million fans on Facebook and said 'So you see now that some people like Vahid.'
