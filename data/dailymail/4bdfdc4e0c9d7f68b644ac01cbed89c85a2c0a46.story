Foreign Minister Julie Bishop is set to become the second Western leader to visit Iran in a decade, when she visits Tehran in April. 

Ms Bishop received the invitation from Iran's Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif and the trip is being seen as a potential game-changer in the fight against terrorism in the Middle East.

Australia's foreign minister apparently got the go-ahead from the White House for the rare visit, with hopes she could play a key role as a broker between Washington and Iran.

There are also hopes that Australia could strike up a trading relationship with Iran, which exports, wheat and meat. 

Ms Bishop, who became the first female deputy leader of the Liberal Party and the first woman to be foreign minister, is now one of the most famous faces in Australian politics.

She is renowned for her immaculate and polished appearance as she makes deals and shakes hands with some of the world's most powerful leaders. 

The Us-aligned government member will sit down with Tehran's minister just two months before the US and Iran's deadline for their energy initiative.

Tehran's Shiite government has been in talks with the US regarding their use of energy, to prevent a possible outbreak of war between Iran and Israel. 

According to Fairfax media, Julie Bishop will do somewhat of a tour around the Middle East, also meeting with leaders in the Saudi Arabia city of Riyadh and also Baghdad. 

It has been over a decade since the last Australian foreign minister Alexander Downer visited Tehran in 2003.

Iran has been closed off to other world leaders in the past few years. The last Western leader to visit the country was UN High Representative Catherin Ashton, who visited the country in 2012.  

Ms Bishop has been leading a carefully crafted campaign to spare the lives of Australians Myuran Sukumaran and Andrew Chan, exercising caution in pointing out problems with Indonesia's legal system while remaining respectful. 

Along with that, she has had to stave off rumours of her taking over the top job from Tony Abbott. 

Her popularity has jumped over the past 12 months, mainly due to her strong performance on the international stage in relation to foreign diplomacy and national security.

Ms Bishop fiercely confronted Russian President Vladimir Putin late last month at a summit in Italy to question him over the MH17 disaster over the Ukraine.

The Foreign Minister was also regarded for pushing the resolution the United Nations Security Council passed back in July to allow Australia and other countries access to the Malaysian Airlines crash site to retrieve the bodies.

But despite Liberal leadership speculation over the past month, Ms Bishop still maintains she is happy in her current role as Foreign Minister.

'(I'm) living the dream and loving the job,' she told Daily Mail Australia in November. 

'I am in the best job I could ever wish for. It's the job I wanted to do when I went into politics.'
