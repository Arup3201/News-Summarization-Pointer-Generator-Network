This dramatic CCTV footage shows the moment thieves used angle grinders and pickaxes to steal more than £3,000 from train station ticket machines.

Police are hunting a gang of men who they believe are responsible for targeting the machines at six railway stations across north London and Hertfordshire since April.

In footage of the raids - which caused more than £100,000 worth of damage - the thieves can be seen taking an angle grinder to the self-service ticket machines before forcing the cash compartment open with pickaxes.

The suspects used angle grinders and pickaxes to force open the self-service ticket machines at six railway stations across north London and Hertfordshire. They stole more than £3,000 in the raids in April and May

Hadley Wood station in Enfield, north London, was targeted on April 22 (pictured) and the thieves stole £650 in cash and caused more than £23,000 worth of damage after breaking into the self-service ticket machine

The most recently reported attack occurred on May 23, when the thieves stole £850 from the ticket machine at Welham Green station in Hertfordshire and caused £7,000 worth of damage

The hooded suspects, who targeted all of the machines in the early hours, then appear to make off with the cash, which amounted to a total of £3,238.

British Transport Police officers have now released CCTV footage and images of three men who are currently their main suspects.

Detective Constable Nick Thompson, leading the investigation, said: ‘I am now confident this spate of thefts is the responsibility of the same gang of three men.

‘They target smaller stations in the early hours when there are no staff on duty and the last train has gone.

‘They arrive as a group, head straight to the automatic ticket vending machines and set about a sustained attack using heavy-duty cutting equipment and pickaxes.’

In the first reported incident, which took place just after midnight on April 19 at Brookmans Park station in Hertfordshire, the suspects tampered with the security cameras before breaking open the front of the ticket machine and stealing £750 in cash. Their actions caused more than £23,000 worth of damage.

This was followed by an attack two days later on April 21 at nearby Bayford railway station. Despite again causing more than £23,000 worth of damage to the machine, the gang left empty-handed as they targeted a machine which only accepted card payments.

Three weeks later two stations were targeted on the same night, with ticket machines at Watton-at-Stone, Hertfordshire, and Oakleigh Park, north London, being attacked in the early hours of May 18. The suspects got away with more than £900 in cash from the two machines and caused an estimated £30,000 worth of damage.

Hadley Wood station in Enfield, north London, was targeted the following morning and the thieves stole £650 in cash and caused more than £23,000 worth of damage.

The most recently reported attack occurred on May 23, when the thieves stole £850 from the ticket machine at Welham Green station in Hertfordshire and caused £7,000 worth of damage.

Police have now launched a major investigation to identify the men as part of Operation Captivity - a nationwide effort to catch criminals who target ticket vending machines at railway stations.

Detective Constable Nick Thompson, leading the case, said: ‘I am now confident this spate of thefts is the responsibility of the same gang of three men. I am doing everything I can to catch the individuals responsible'

DC Thompson said: ‘The money stolen in these attacks really does pale into insignificance when you consider the cost of the damage – which is estimated as thirty-three times the value of the cash taken.

‘These thefts haven’t just hit the rail industry financially, they’ve also caused disruption and inconvenience to passengers, with ticket machines taken out of service for repairs.

‘I am doing everything I can to catch the individuals responsible as I believe it’s only a matter of time before they strike again.

‘If anyone recognises the men pictured, or thinks they may have witnessed the incidents taking place, please get in touch.’

Tony Holland, First Capital Connect crime prevention manager, said: ‘Last year we invested £700,000 to upgrade our CCTV systems and ensure we had coverage at every single station.

‘We're pleased that has paid off in providing an image of these criminals whose actions have caused so much damage.’
