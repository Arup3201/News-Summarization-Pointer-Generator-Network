Argentina traveled to Hong Kong looking for a morale-boosting victory following their 2-0 loss to bitter rivals Brazil. It's fair to say they got what they came for.

Lionel Messi - who missed a penalty against Brazil - came off the bench to score twice as Argentina claimed an easy 7-0 victory against Hong Kong.

Gonzalo Higuain and Nicolas Gaitan also scored a brace each while Ever Banega opened the scoring. 

Hong Kong had secured an important 2-1 win against Singapore on Friday but offered little against a far superior Argentina side.

Host commentator

Full-time and it's an easy victory for Argentina.

Some supporters ran on to the pitch as the game neared the end with one lucky fan even getting his shirt signed by Messi!

Messi scores again to make it 7-0. 

The 27-year-old cuts in from the right, runs through four bodies on the edge of the area and unleashes an unstoppable shot.

Argentina have breezed to this victory. Hong Kong have barely ventured into the opposition half.

Manchester United star Angel Di Maria comes on for Gaitan who can be pleased with his contribution.

Barcelona's Javier Mascherano, formerly of Liverpool, comes on for Fernando Gago while Enzo Perez is replaced by Roberto Pereyra.

And another!

Gaitan gets his second of the match.

It took him only six minutes. Messi is on the scoresheet.

Gaitan finds the Barcelona frontman with a tidy through ball and Messi casually chips the ball over the goalkeeper.

The man everyone wants to see, Lionel Messi, is on the pitch.

The Manchester City right back comes on for Inter Milan's Roncaglia for the last half an hour.

It's Higuain at the double!

Gaitan squares the ball to the Real Madrid frontman who taps the ball into the net. Easy.

Debutant goalkeeper Nahuel Guzman is replaced by Agustin Marchesin who received his first call-up in four years for this clash.

Nothing the goalkeeper could do about that one... 3-0 to Argentina.

Nicolas Gaitan cuts in from the right before hammering the ball into the back of the net.

Game over? Very (very) probably.

Napoli striker Higuain powers a header home to double Argentina's lead.

Banega, Gaitan and Pastore have seen so much of the ball during the first half... so much so, that the stats show that Hong Kong have had just 22 per cent of possession.

It looks to be so hot and humid in Hong Kong that the players soaked shirts appear to be sticking to them.

Not ideal conditions for a game of football.

Second week in October and the return of 'proper football weather' - cold, dark, wet nights - is on the horizon here in England.

The midfielder is in the thick of the action once again.

However, after trading passes with goalscorer Banega, the 25-year-old shoots wide of the target from 20 yards out.

Argentina have the lead and it's Sevilla midfielder Ever Banega with the goal.

The midfielder, a target for Everton a couple of seasons ago, takes full advantage of a mistake by goalkeeper Yapp to put Argentina ahead.

Yapp failed to hold onto Nicolas Gaitan's side-foot, the  nearest Hong Kong defender made a hash of his clearance and the ball fell to Banega on the edge of the area to smash the ball into the net.

PSG goalkeeper Javier Pastore was played in by Gonzalo Higuain on the left of the box in acres of space but the Hong Kong goalkeeper Yapp Hung Fai saves well.

 

Argentina, without star men Lionel Messi and Angel di Maria, will be looking to make amends for Saturday's 2-0 defeat to fierce rivals Brazil.

Former Real Madrid midfielder Fernando Gago, now with Boca Juniors in his homeland, captains the side in Messi's absence.

Argentina: Guzman, Roncaglia, Otamendi, Vergini, Vangioni, Perez, Gago, Banega, Pastore, Higuain, Gaitan.

Hong Kong: Yapp, C. Lee, Agbo, Naegelein, Huang, Xu, W. Lee, Cheung, Chan, Karikari, Ju.
