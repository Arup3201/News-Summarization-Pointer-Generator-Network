It is one of the great relationship clichés of the modern age.

Men do the getting lost, and women do the trickier business of finding the way back to where they were supposed to be in the first place while hubby refuses to ask for directions and shouts at the sat-nav.

But, according to a new survey, it seems
 that both sexes are equally adept at misplacing their bearings – 
especially when they are on holiday.

Where are we now, where are we now? Britons spend 22 million years lost on holiday every year

Research conducted by O2 Travel has discovered that, across the space of a year, Britons – both men and women – spend some 22million hours bemused as to where they are.

This, it seems, is a 21st century phenomenon, pinned to our increasing obsession with our smartphones, and our reliance upon them.

The study revealed that only six per cent of us ever leave home in the UK without our trusty mobile tucked into a bag or pocket – but only 14 per cent of us carry our phones with us when out and about on a foreign holiday, preferring to leave them in the hotel.

This leads to scenarios where – suddenly unable to whip out a phone and check our exact locations in an unfamiliar environment – we wander around clueless.

According to the survey, the main cause of this phone-phobia while overseas is a fear of running up enormous bills thanks to data roaming charges or long phone calls.

‘People use their mobiles as a source of information on a daily basis,’ says Nina Bibby of O2. ‘We believe it should be no different when they are on holiday.’

Other interesting nuggets thrown out by the survey include the revelation that one of the pet British peeves while on holiday is having to deal with rude tourists at their destination – a source of aggravation cited by 24 per cent of those questioned.

Unfamiliar food was also listed as a cause for concern, with over one in five people – 21 per cent – declaring foreign dishes to be ‘unappetising’.
