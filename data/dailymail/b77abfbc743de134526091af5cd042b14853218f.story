Roaming elephants, an Ethiopian tribal woman wearing a kaleidoscope of colour and a preening flamingo are just some of the stunning pictures submitted to a prestigious photography awards this year.

From brilliant shots of nature in her element to moving
 real-life portraits, amateur and professional photographers have sent in their very best work in the hope of winning the 2013 Sony World Photography Awards - and the $30,000 (£19,000) top prize.

But it's not too late to enter. The judges are keen that nobody should miss out on the chance to win, although there only a week to go until the deadline.

The deadline for entries for the ten open categories, for amateurs and enthusiasts, is 4 January 2013.  The Professional competition, with 15 categories for serious photographers, will close on 9 January 2013. 

All of the winners and finalists will get to see their work exhibited at Somerset House, in London, between April and May 2013. 

They will also be featured across the
 WPO website and all winners, as well as a selection of shortlisted 
photographers, will be published in the annual Sony World Photography 
Awards hardcover book.
