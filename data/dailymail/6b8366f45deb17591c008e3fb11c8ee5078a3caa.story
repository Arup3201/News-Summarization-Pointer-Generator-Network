David Silva has handed Manchester City a timely boost by underlining his commitment to the new Premier League champions.

City have Silva and another of their star players, Yaya Toure, under contract until 2017 but the Ivory Coast midfielder has caused a storm by warning that he will demand to leave unless the club show him more respect.

However, Silva has reassured City that he has no plans to quit the Etihad after winning his second Premier League title and the Capital One Cup this season under new manager Manuel Pellegrini.

Moving on? Yaya Toure has accused City of showing him a lack of respect in recent weeks

Speaking in his hometown of Arguineguin on the island of Gran Canaria before leaving for the World Cup with Spain, Silva said: ‘You never get tired of winning and at the moment I’m winning with City, so I don’t have any ideas of making a change.

‘We scored a lot of goals this season and it looks as though it’s building up to a good future.

‘The manager has created a good atmosphere and brought a better energy to the pace and the result of that is we have won two trophies so far.’

Asked if could extend his contract at City in future, the 28-year-old said: ‘That depends on the club, not necessarily on me. At the moment I’m happy and happy to stay there.

‘With football you can never predict what’s going to happen but at the moment I’m very happy and don’t see any changes.’

Silva, who will be looking to win his fourth major tournament in a row with Spain, believes that City are ready to take the next step and conquer Europe.

They will make a fourth attempt at winning the Champions League next season after Pellegrini’s side reached the knockout stage for the first time before going out to Barcelona.

‘We want to build up to winning the Champions League,’ added Silva. ‘This year the group wasn’t too difficult but we aspire to winning the Champions League next time.

‘That’s the objective. After winning these titles in the last few years the very next objective is to win the Champions League.’
