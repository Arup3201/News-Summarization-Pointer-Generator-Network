Police divers have searched two woodland ponds in the hunt for missing Catherine Nee (pictured)

Police divers are today searching two woodland ponds in a hunt for a woman who went missing 12 years ago.

Officers investigating the disappearance of Catherine Nee turned their attention to the deep ponds at Burghfield, Berkshire after receiving a tip-off.

Ms Nee was 32 years old when she was last seen by her family, from whom she was estranged, in 2002 and it was initially thought that she had simply moved away to another area.

However police launched a missing persons investigation a decade later and a 48-year-old man from the Thames Valley area was arrested on suspicion of her murder last February. He was later released without charge.

The grandmother-of-six, who would now be aged 44 years, was originally from Reading, Berkshire, but was living in the Ilfracombe area of Devon at the time of her disappearance.

Detective Inspector Kevin Mahon, from Thames Valley Police, said: 'Catherine became estranged from her family 14 years ago and in that time they have made attempts to try to find her but to no avail.

'They have constantly wondered what happened to her. They turned to Thames Valley Police for assistance in 2012 to try to trace her and our investigation has led us to this point.

'The Thames Valley Police specialist search and rescue team is conducting a search of two ponds in the Burghfield woods on the basis of this information. 

'We do not know what we may find, but the hope is that we will discover items relating to Catherine's disappearance.

'In the meantime we are continuing to appeal to anyone who knew Catherine, who was also known as Kathy, or has any information of her whereabouts, to get in touch.'

Early investigations by detectives in 2012 failed to find any trace of Ms Nee, also known as Kathy, after she disappeared in 2002.

She left the family home in Dee Park, Reading, Berkshire, after a 'difference of opinion' with relatives.

Her 71-year-old mother Nellie's last contact with her daughter was in a series of brief letters.

Police said that Ms Nee was last seen in IIfracombe, Devon, where she was living with a partner. She has six grandchildren who she had never met.

Her mother, Mrs Nee, said at the time: 'I'm not getting any younger. I want her home and so do the rest of the family.

Police say they hope the search will uncover 'items relating to Ms Nee's disappearance'

'I think about her all the time. She is always in my head and always will be.

'I pray every night that one day she will come home. Her grandchildren certainly want to meet her and I would love her to meet them.

'I would throw my arms around her if she came home tomorrow.'

'Her family is desperate to trace her so we urge anyone with information to get in touch.'

Police have yet to reveal where the new tip-off to search the ponds at Burghfield had come from although it was known that it was not from anyone currently in prison.
