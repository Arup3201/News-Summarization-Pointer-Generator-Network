Her father may be the county’s third richest man, but no one could accuse Megan Ellison of being happy to just sit back and sponge off daddy’s billions.

As CEO of Oracle, Larry Ellison is worth an estimated $41 billion, but daughter Megan is quickly amassing her own personal fortune as she juggles a successful career in the movies with a burgeoning property portfolio.

Film producer Megan, 27, already has a host of successful Hollywood pictures to her name including American Hustle, Lawless, Zero Dark Thirty and True Grit.

Megan Ellison's new $20 million home has been described as a cross between an art museum and a church

But when she isn’t making movies, Megan manages a property portfolio to which she recently added two parcels in Los Angeles – a $20 million contemporary home and the neighboring piece of land for $10 million, according to the Los Angeles Times. 

Last year Megan made a cool $14 million profit after selling a three-house compound in Hollywood Hills West for close to $47 million, just five years after she bought it.

Last June she also bought a one-bed, one-bath apartment in New York City.

The $20 million home – described as a cross between an art museum and a church - was built in 1990 and features curved lines, open glass walls and a spectacular view of the city lights below.

High-end features include marble floors, a full bar, a grotto swimming pool with a spa, a sand volleyball court and parking for 25 vehicles

The 9,204-square-foot home has six bedrooms, eight baths as well as two guest apartments.

Located in the Hollywood Hills, Ellison’s purchase was quite pricey for the area, reports Zillow.

The most expensive home currently on the market there is listed for $28 million, but the remaining 264 listings are listed closer to the median home value of $1,371,800.

The expectation is that Megan will raze the current property and add the plot next door to create a nine-acre 
mountaintop estate. In the past she has always renovated her homes before returning 
them to the market.

Dad Larry, 69, is the third richest man
 in the country according to Forbes, and as well as running the 
tech giant is also known for his many real estate acquisitions.

In 2004 and 2005, he purchased more than 12 properties in Malibu, California, worth more than $180 million. The $65 million Larry spent on five contiguous lots at Malibu's Carbon Beach was at one time the most costly residential transaction in U.S. history.

Not to be outdone, Megan's brother David, 30, also has his own film production company Skydance Productions and his Hollywood successes include Star Trek Into Darkness and World War Z.
