He may not have arrived on a sleigh being pulled by reindeer, but Santa Claus came to a man’s rescue in the Hunter Valley over the weekend.

To get into the Christmas spirit Nick Carey had been dressing up as Santa Claus while working with his crew from NSW Fire & Rescue Telarah brigade, but instead of delivering presents on Saturday he delivered a 20-year-old man from death after he had been pulled from his burning house unconscious suffering from smoke inhalation.

The Daily Telegraph reported the fire crew had been on their annual Christmas lolly run in their tinselled fire truck when they saw smoke coming from a house. Instead of coming down the chimney Santa waited outside as his helpers - the rest of the fire crew - broke down the front door and went in using breathing apparatus. But Mr Carey soon jumped into action.

“The BA (breathing apparatus) crew radioed­ that they’ve found someone inside so I went up to the front door to help carry him out,” Mr Carey explained.

After helping to carry him to the front lawn Santa then started doing CPR on the 20-year-old. The man began breathing again thanks to the speedy work by Mr Carey and his colleagues.

'I think the beard and the hat came off when we started the resuscitation,' Mr Carey told the Daily Telegraph. 'It’s definitely the weirdest and most awkward situation I’ve found myself in.' 

But when the truck turned on to nearby Marlborough St the crew noticed the fire. Neighbour Michael Johnson said everything appeared normal as the fire truck made its way past his house, but this soon changed.

When Mr Johnson went around the corner a few minutes later he saw Santa Claus trying to revive a man lying on the ground unconscious.

'This young bloke is nearly dead and Santa Claus is bringing him back to life. It’s the ultimate Christmas present anyone could ever get,' he said.
