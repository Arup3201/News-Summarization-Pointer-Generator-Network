ABC News' George Stephanopoulos landed the highly-prized first television interview with Officer Darren Wilson who broke his silence to defend shooting Michael Brown.

Wilson sat down with the 'Good Morning America' co-host, less than 24 hours after a grand jury decided not to indict the 28-year-old officer in the death of  Brown this summer.

In a preview on Tuesday, Stephanopoulos told viewers that he spent more than an hour with Wilson in a 'secret location.'

In television terms, the Wilson interview was one of the biggest 'wins' of the year -  the officers's low-profile since the shooting means every media organization covering the high-profile story was eager to speak to him.

The network interrupted its afternoon programming on Wednesday for Stephanopoulos to talk about the interview. 

He said Wilson told him that he is 'sorry' for the death of the 18-year-old, but that he would not do 'anything differently'. 

'He says he did what he was trained to do. He has a clean conscience over his actions that day,' Stephanopoulos said.

Stephanopoulos tweeted a photo of the interview which showed Wilson sitting at a table wearing an open-necked blue shirt.

Next to the photo the This Week host wrote: 'Just finished a more than hourlong interview with Officer Darren Wilson. No question off limits.' 

It is unclear if ABC paid for the interview - CNN'S Brian Stelter tweeted: 'TV nets sometimes find $$$ ways to 'win' exclusive interviews. But not Darren Wilson: ABCer says 'No payment, no licensing, no NOTHING.' 

CNN'S Anderson Cooper is doing his show from Ferguson as is NBC'S Brian Williams.  

ABC News plans to feature portions of the discussion on 'World News Tonight,' ''Nightline' and 'Good Morning America' and promised to post the full interview on its website.

Speaking on his CNN Sunday morning show Reliable Sources, host Brian Stelter revealed that five anchors had all had off-the-record conversations with the police officer and that his list was not exhaustive.

Within hours of his name being linked with having secret meetings with Darren Ferguson, Anderson Cooper tweeted to confirm that it had happened and was standard procedure 

CNN host Don Lemon also tweeted to confirm that he had met with Darren Wilson to sound him out for a possible exclusive TV interview

'My sense from my sources is that it's mostly the anchors doing the talking in these off-the-record meetings, it's mostly Darren Wilson listening and getting to know the person, said Stelter.

Soon after the program aired on Sunday, both Cooper and Lemon confirmed via Twitter that the meetings had taken place.

Another TV anchors who met with Wilson was CNN's Don Lemon 

Both were keen to explain that such meetings are a normal part of the TV guest booking process in order to establish trust and comfort with the potential interviewee.

'For the record, I met briefly with Darren Wilson a few days ago to see if he wanted to do an interview with me. That's standard procedure,' Cooper wrote.

Cooper denied that his meeting with Wilson was part of a pro-police conspiratorially and pointed out that he'd repeatedly interviewed Michael Brown's family members and their attorneys.

'I'd also like to interview the grand jury,' Cooper wrote. '

'There is no conspiracy here. Reporters want to interview people and sometimes you have to meet them first.'

He added that Wilson had chosen 'not to do an interview with me.' 

Cooper, on Twitter, drew a comparison to another man in the news that many journalists wanted to interview earlier this year: disgraced Los Angeles Clippers team owner Donald Sterling.

'Prior to interviewing Donald Sterling, for example, I also met with him to ask him to do an interview. That's how you ask for an interview,' Cooper wrote.

Separately, Lemon wrote on Twitter that his meeting with Wilson was 'not out of the ordinary,' and that 'We've interviewed the Brown family, Dorian Johnson and all witnesses. Of course we'd want to interview Wilson.'
