Another blue-collar American worker wins a million dollars this week from playing the lottery.

Tony Auriemma, 38, a Long Island plumber who has been spending seven days a week helping Sandy victims since the storm hit, won $1 million in a New York Lottery game, NBC New York reports.

‘We scratched it off and started screaming,’ Auriemma told the news channel.  ‘We thought we won a hundred thousand dollars and then my wife said, 'no, it's a million dollars!'  And I said, “oh, my God!”’

Big winner: Long Island plumber Tony Auriemma, 38, won $1 million in a New York Lottery game

Twisted fate of luck: The father of three said he would have missed purchasing his winning ticket on November 18 if it weren't for Hurricane sandy, which caused him to cancel a hunting trip before he bought the winning ticket

Dedicated worker: Auriemma has been spending seven days a week helping Sandy victims since the storm hit

The father of three said he would have missed purchasing his winning ticket on November 18 if it weren’t for the big storm that ravaged the East Coast.

He said he was supposed to be away on his annual hunting trip, but Sandy-related obligations forced him to cancel.

Auriemma, his wife Jennifer and mother-in-law Frances Brauer were announced as winners on Wednesday at Lottery headquarters in Garden City, Long Island.

The Auriemmas and Brauer will split the prize, each taking home about $16 thousand a year for twenty years, according to NBC.

Their victory follows that of Larry Chandler, a 34-year-old electrician from Highland, Indiana, who faced foreclosure on his home and who won $1 million from the Powerball lottery on Wednesday.

Big plans: Chandler said that he plans to keep his job as a union electrician but will start a college fund for his daughter and help his parents out

Taking home the check: Five of the six numbers of Larry Chandler's lottery ticket matched that of the Powerball so he took home $1million in the payout

Chandler won because his ticket matched five of the six numbers.

Both recent lottery winners said they plan to go back to work despite the bundles of cash they’ll soon be seeing.

Auriemma said he plans to use part of his winnings to pay for his children's college educations.
