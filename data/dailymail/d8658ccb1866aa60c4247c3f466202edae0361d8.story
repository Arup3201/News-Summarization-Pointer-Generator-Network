Mel B married husband Stephen Belafonte after a whirlwind romance but admitted she knew 'he was no angel' as he has string of convictions and run-ins with police dating back twenty years.

The film producer, 39, has been prosecuted for handling stolen goods, beating the mother of his child and killing a mallard with a brick, but denies he ever attacked his wife, also 39, of seven years.

His denial came after X Factor viewers took to Twitter to discuss mysterious marks on her body when she appeared on the talent show's final on Sunday. She had just left hospital where she had been for three days after being admitted with stomach pains.

Belafonte described the remarks as 'disgusting', adding: 'I don't usually respond to Twitter msgs but I will respond to comments of hitting wife which I think are quite disgusting untrue'.

X Factor viewers had said that Mel B's arms appeared to be scratched during Sunday's show, but insiders have insisted any marks were caused by her hospital treatment.

'The scratches on her body were due to the hospital care she had before the final,' a source told The Sun. 

The source added: 'She was advised against appearing on the final on Sunday but Mel is a true professional and didn't want to let the show down.

'But it was obvious to everyone just how much she was suffering and she was crying at certain points during the show.' 

Today it has been reported that former Spice Girl Mel B has  packed up and left the home the couple have been sharing in London amid claims they had repeatedly rowing and it became too much to bear.

1994: Charged with  burglary and theft in New Jersey in 1994. Case made it to court in 2001 he was eventually convicted for receiving stolen property.

2000: Accused of assaulting two men in a row on a highway, and according to initial charges he threw a missile of some sort at their car. The assault case was reduced to vandalism after he agreed to pay for the damage caused to the vehicle.

2003: Admits domestic charge linked to drunken attack on his partner Nicole Contreras. Later said he admitted it when 'confused' but the conviction stuck

2007: Two months after marrying Mel B he admitted battering a mallard to death with a brick.

2010: Involved in brawl with three men in exclusive London hotel. One man went to hospital. Mel B said he was defending her. Police were called but no charges brought.

Throughout their marriage Mel has stood by her husband and defended husband Stephen  - real name Stephen Stansbury – who has managed to make his fortune making TV and films in Hollywood despite his criminal past.

Before they married in Las Vegas in 2007 she was said to be shocked to hear about his history  but  went into the relationship 'with her eyes open'. A friend said at the time: 'Mel knows he's no angel.'

Their partnership came after she admitted to having been in a long-term relationship with a woman before falling for Stephen after a kiss and said she 'trusted him 100% with my life'.

Soon after their wedding the singer had to defend her husband's past when it emerged that he had battered his common-law wife Nicole Contreras during a drunken row at their home in 2003.

The millionaire film producer attacked the mother of his daughter Giselle, now ten, in what was described as a 'malicious and unlawful' drunken frenzy.

He did not contest the charge, which the judge said was the same as a guilty plea, and said: 'This happened crazily, one drunk, retarded night.'

He was accused of vandalising Nicole's phone by spitting into it but this was dropped.

Later he said he did not realise that he had admitted battering his ex-partner, saying that the admission came at a moment when he was 'confused and stressed'. But this plea was rejected. 

While partying with his wife in 2010,  Belafonte was involved in a fight with three men at the luxury five star May Fair Hotel. One man was left needing hospital treatment following the incident.

But Mel B stood by  her burly husband, claiming he was only acting in her defence.

She told the Mail: 'He was rushing to the defence of a woman - me. He was my defender. So I can't be mad. It's been blown into more than it was.'

Bystanders to the fight reported that it began after film producer Mr Belafonte, who was drinking cocktails in the hotel's Amba Bar & Grill, heard a fellow drinker make a derogatory comment about his wife.

The singer then watched on as hotel staff broke-up the fight before police and ambulance arrived on the scene. However, no charges were brought following the incident.

Explanation: Mel B said later he had been acting in self defence and defending her after someone made a derogatory comment about her

Love: Mel B said she knew about Belafonte's past but trusted him '100 per cent with my life'

In 2007 Belafonte admitted killing a mallard with a brick outside his house in the state of New Jersey, but fled to Los Angeles without paying the £300 court fine.

Later he told OK magazine: 'Oh, yes, apparently I killed a duck.'

'But I haven't. Sure I got into fights and I did get drunk but I learned from it and I don't do it now.I don't sit around at 33 and panic about the press writing a story that happened when I was 17.' 

Court papers: These documents describe how Belafonte attacked his former partner in 2003 and how a 1997 burglary charge became a handling stolen goods charge

Support: The singer, left kissig her husband, had to defend his past when it emerged that he had battered his ex partner Nicole Contreras, together right, during a drunken row at their home in 2003.

Belafonte's criminal past is known to have started 20 years ago.

The then 19-year-old was arrested for burglary in New Jersey in 1994.

He failed to show for a court appearance in 1995 and was arrested on the warrant in 2001. He was eventually convicted for receiving stolen property under the value of $200 after the burglary charge and one of theft was dropped.  

In 2000 he was accused of assaulting two men in a row on a highway, and according to initial charges he threw a missile of some sort at their car.

The assault case was reduced to vandalism after he agreed to pay for the damage caused to the vehicle and he had to do community service at a children's home. 

It is alleged that he failed to reveal that he had married Nancy Carmell in Las Vegas in 1997 on his marriage paperwork when he married Mel B. 

He and Ms Carmell separated within three months, with his then wife going home to Hawaii and they divorced two years later.

An ex-girlfriend, who did not want to be named, claimed he persistently cheated on her.

She said 'He never invited me over, never introduced me to his friends, never talked about his family. We met about two weeks after he broke up with the mother of his daughter.

'But he later told me that he was still sleeping with her throughout the whole time we dated. I knew in my gut something wasn't right about this guy.'
