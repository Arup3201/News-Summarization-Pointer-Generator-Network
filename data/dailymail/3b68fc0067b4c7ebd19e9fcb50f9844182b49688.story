Dan Cole is a prop and a born-and-bred Leicester stalwart, so making a song and dance about having neck surgery is not the done thing. He settles for: ‘It’s not ideal.’

No fuss — as ever. The 27-year-old broke off from preparations for the Tigers’ European Champions Cup clash with holders Toulon at Welford Road on Sunday to reflect on his decimated year and he was typically matter of fact, despite the extreme circumstances.

Having become a fixture up front for his club and for England, and having shown remarkable physical resilience at the sharp end of the scrum duel on a weekly basis, Cole’s serene progress was abruptly and worryingly interrupted at the start of this year. A loss of power alerted medics to a problem which turned out to be very serious.

 Cole missed most of the year after he required surgery on a bulging disc in his neck

He said: ‘I had a stiff neck after we played Ulster in the European Cup. When I woke up the next morning I was even more stiff than usual. I went away with England and played a couple of Tests but when it got to the third week I tried to do a bench press in the gym and basically had no power in my left arm. That flagged up something neural so I was sent off for a scan which showed I had a bulging disc in my neck.

‘You don’t really want to have surgery on your neck so I went to the specialist, who recommended three months of rest. I did that but it didn’t really do anything so they operated in May. It was meant to be a six-month recovery period but I’ve come back a bit quicker.’

Having made his return ahead of schedule last month, Cole insists he feels ‘better than ever’ following his extended break. But being forced to address the grim fact that his job had caused spinal damage was not a comfortable process.

Cole said that he was nervous about his return, but only that he would be rubbish after the lengthy lay-off

‘It’s not ideal,’ he said. ‘I understand the forces that come through your neck. You don’t want to mess around with it. But a fair few people have had the surgery I had. The surgeon has operated on most of the Leicester team! He’s done Tom Youngs’ back, Tom Croft’s neck, Miles Benjamin’s neck, Geoff Parling’s neck... Seeing them come back and play, you know you’ll be all right. It’s reassuring because it’s your livelihood.’

Rest and rehab was a new and unwelcome scenario for Cole. The disruption to his daily routine was hard to take. There was little motivation to climb out of bed in the mornings. He would go to the club, watch video footage of matches, sit in on team meetings and enjoy a free lunch. In hindsight, he admits he could have made better use of his time off but he didn’t know then just how much of it he would have.

‘I wasn’t doing weights and you can’t really do any rehab on your neck at that point because they don’t want you to activate your neck muscles, so it was… boring — massively boring,’ said Cole. ‘Everyone says, “Why don’t you go away travelling?” but you can’t just go abroad for three months. I’m not really a beach person anyway!’

The slog of rehab has been worthwhile. Having spent a lot of time this year helping Leicester’s other props, notably Logovi’i Mulipola and Fraser Balmain, Cole began to focus on his own game again. Due to carefully monitored resumption of contact work, he had no concerns about subjecting his neck to set-piece pressure again, but he was slightly on edge before his comeback in the 29-13 LV Cup win against Sale on November 9.

‘Before the game there was a bit of nervousness, not about the neck but about being rubbish!’ he said. ‘You’ve been out for 10 months and you don’t have a clue. Thankfully, I got thrown straight into a scrum and after that you’re on auto-pilot. You just get on with it. Since then I’ve played 65 minutes and 80 minutes.’

Cole had been missed by the Tigers, with director of rugby Richard Cockerill suggesting that his Lion at No 3 spreads ‘fear in opposition teams’. England have also felt the loss of their premier tighthead, although David Wilson has done a sterling job in his absence.

The 27-year-old has been capped 45 times for England and he knows a return to the squad is not guaranteed

For his part, Cole found it tough to watch the national team’s June tour of New Zealand from afar. ‘It was difficult because I wanted to be involved,’ he said. ‘I was sat on my backside, doing nothing, feeling a bit sad because I was sat on the sofa, watching England play.’

In recent weeks, England’s forwards stood tall against their rivals from the southern hemisphere, despite losses against New Zealand and South Africa. Cole feels that the Red Rose pack is now one of the leading set-piece units in the world and he knows that his return to the starting XV for the Six Nations will be no foregone conclusion.

But that personal battle can wait. Sunday's clash with Toulon will be a club match with the intensity and class of an international. ‘You can come across international packs at club level, but it’s very rare you come across an international squad from 1-23,’ said Cole.

‘It could be as good as a Test match and knowing the way the French play, it’s potentially more forward-dominated, so in some ways, it could be tougher than a Test match.’

Cole will relish that challenge. He has a chance to end his less-than-ideal year in fine style.
