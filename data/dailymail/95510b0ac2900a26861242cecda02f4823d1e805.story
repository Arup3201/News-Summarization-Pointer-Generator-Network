The devastated family of a 39-year-old woman who assaulted her own children before being shot dead by police has revealed how stress and alcohol may have pushed her to 'breaking point'.

Tiffany Terry, 39, was 'wielding three knives' when she was confronted by police outside her home in Omaha, Nebraska, after attacking her nine-year-old son, Connor, and daughter, Bailee Godek, 18.

Officers shouted, 'Drop the knife! Drop the knife now!' at least eight times, but Mrs Terry refused to do so, police said. Instead, she apparently threw one of the knives at 23-year-old officer Emilio Luna.

Luna and her colleague, Matthew Digilio, 40, then shot the mother-of-two on her lawn six times. Although she was rushed to Nebraska Medical Center, she died two days later, on Thursday.

Now, Mrs Terry's family have revealed that stress and pain from her multiple illnesses - including lupus, which she was diagnosed with in 2013 and rheumatoid arthritis - may have led her to 'snap'.

'She was not a monster. She snapped, and we don't really know why,' Kathy O'Neill, Mrs Terry's aunt, said, adding that her niece had been drinking and using medication, likely to deal with her pain. 

'It was Tiffany... but the actions were not the Tiffany that we knew and loved. That's the only explanation we have, is she just got to a breaking point and something snapped,' Mrs O'Neill said.

'I'm numb, and I'm broken hearted. I just feel lost. We never dreamed that it would end up like this.'

Mrs Terry had been working as a phlebotomist at Octapharma Plasma when she was shot at her home. However, the two illnesses had recently made it difficult for her to work full-time in the job.

Lupus, which typically occurs when the body's immune system attacks its own tissues and organs. causes inflammation, while rheumatoid arthritis also inflames joints and surrounding tissues.

Mrs Terry was also likely stressed by the upcoming anniversary of the death of her brother, who was killed in a car crash on February 1, 2008, her aunt said, adding: 'She's never really gotten over that.'

Police were alerted to Mrs Terry's unusual behavior  on Tuesday afternoon after Connor called his father, George Terry, at work.

The youngster told him:: 'Something is going on with mommy and... I'm scared.'

Officers arrived at the family's home near 50th and Hickory streets shortly before 5pm. Seconds later, Mrs Terry burst from the door screaming expletives and wielding three knives, police said.

She was gunned down after she hurled one of the weapons at Luna. Mrs O'Neill said her family is questioning why the officers fired at her, instead of 'try[ing] to subdue her in some other way'.

As required by state law, a grand jury will now assess the officers' actions. However, Police Chief Todd Schmaderer told the Omaha World-Herald they were justified based on Mrs Terry's actions.

During the two days that Mrs Terry battled for survival in hospital before eventually succumbing to her injuries, her family saw glimpses of the kind, loving woman they adored, Mrs O'Neill said. 

'She kept mouthing things like I love you and I am sorry, and when I walked in yesterday morning it was a totally different Tiffany again,' she told WOWT.

In addition to her husband and two children, Mrs Terry is survived by Mr Terry's three grandchildren. A visitation is being held on Monday, while a graveside service will take place on Wednesday. 

Mrs Terry's family has set up a memorial fund to help pay for funeral expenses and establish a trust for her children. Donations can be made at any Security National Bank.
