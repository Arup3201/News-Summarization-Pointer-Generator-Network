Motorists are paying the price of a booming economy as congestion grows and traffic speeds slow, new figures reveal.

Motorway traffic levels have reached an all-time high as the rise of ‘White Van Man’ delivering goods and services continues apace, according to the official Government figures.

A-roads are also becoming busier with average speeds on some roads reducing.

With the UK’s earnings gross domestic product (GDP) also growing the Department for Transport said; ‘It is likely that such economic growth is contributing to the continued upward trend in traffic volumes.’

The RAC said the ‘good news’ for the economy could spell bad news for millions of motorists caught in gridlock caused by extra traffic and bottlenecks.

The new figures show that vehicles travelled a record 16.3 billion miles on British motorways from July to September 2014. This was 2.3 per cent higher than over the same period last year 2013 and 1.3 per cent higher than in April to June 2014.

The Department for Transport (DfT) figures showed that total motor vehicle traffic on British roads increased 2.2 per cent in summer 2014 compared with summer 2013.

Light goods vehicle traffic - typically white vans - continued to rise at higher rate than any other vehicle type, increasing 6.9 per cent in summer 2014 compared with summer 2013.

Car traffic was up 1.4 per cent this summer, while traffic increased on all classes of road with the biggest rise (3.5 per cent ) being on urban minor roads.

The Transport Department said: ‘GDP increased over Quarter 3 2014 (July to September) as the four key industrial groupings within the economy (services, production, construction and agriculture) indicated increases in output.

‘It is likely that such economic growth is contributing to the continued upward trend in traffic volumes.’

RAC head of external affairs Pete Williams said: “This is clearly good news in for the economy as motorways are vital for business and increased use indicates more activity, which has already been suggested by the latest rise in GDP for the third quarter of 2014.

‘However it does also put extra strain on parts of the road network adjoining motorways that are not able to cope with the volume of traffic and therefore lead to bottlenecks.

‘Many of these ‘pinch points’ are already being addressed by the Highways Agency which is good news for road users who will hopefully benefit from more free-flowing traffic conditions in the future.’

Mr Williams added: ‘The increase in light good vehicles, or ‘white van man’, is a really encouraging sign that small businesses and tradesmen, the lifeblood of the UK economy, are thriving.’

RAC Foundation director Professor Stephen Glaister said: ‘Whoever predicted that the link between economic growth and traffic volume was broken will have to have a rethink. GDP is up and mileage is up, just as the DfT has always anticipated.

‘These figures beg questions about what rising mileage means for congestion, emissions and particularly road safety.’

The professor said: ‘Last week we learned there has been a marked rise in road casualties after years of reduction. We urgently need a strategy on how we are going to preserve and improve on our generally good safety record against a backdrop of a rising population and increasing traffic.’
