Double the loss: Mother-of-two Beverly Smith, 32, and her unborn baby girl were killed Saturday in a multi-vehicle car crash in Ohio 

Just two weeks shy of her due date, a 32-year-old mother and her unborn baby girl were killed in a Valentine's Day car crash.

Beverly Smith and her husband Eric, 33,  were driving home to Middleville, Michigan from a medical trip to New Jersey when they encountered whiteout conditions on I-90 Saturday morning near Sandusky, Ohio. 

The religious mother-of-two was sitting in the passenger's seat, reading a bible, when their Ford F-150 became entangled in a massive multi-vehicle car wreck involving  at least eight vehicles - including six semi-trucks.

One of the tractor-trailer's jack-knifed and collided with the Smith's truck, which became pinned underneath the freight hauler.

It took two and a half hours for emergency responders to cut Mrs Smith out of the passenger seat, and rush her to the hospital where she was tragically pronounced dead along with her unborn baby. 

Her husband Eric was also hospitalized, but none of his injuries are life-threatening. He was able to hold their stillborn daughter, which they planned to name Grace, briefly, according to his aunt Kathy Van Faasen who spoke on his behalf with MLive on Monday.

'People need to know that we're more than just that crash, that God has a plan for me and God had a plan for Bev,' Eric said, according to Van Fassen. 'There's still hope in the middle of tragedy.'

The Smith's two other children, 3-year-old daughter Claire and 1-year-old son Sam, remain in the care of family members who were taking care of them while their parents were on a trip last week.

A family torn apart: Mrs Smith and her husband Eric were travelling back to their home in Michigan from a medical trip to New Jersey when they became involved in the crash. Their two children, 3-year-old Claire (right) and 1-year-old Sam (left), were being cared for by family at the time

Since November, Mrs Smith's vision had been weakened by an eye disease called Retinitis pigmentosa. She and her husband traveled to New Jersey last week to receive acupuncture treatment for the condition, which did end up improving Mrs Smith's vision. 

Mr Smith's aunt says he is finding comfort in his faith that God was with his wife during her final moments. 

He was able to retrieve the bible she was reading at the time of the crash, which had a bookmark on the page she was reading. He plans to give it to his  daughter when she is older.

Friends and family remember Mrs Smith as an avid runner, who would often participate in half marathons and other races. She and her husband liked taking their family on camping trips and boating on Lake Michigan.  

Stuck: Mrs Smith was just two weeks shy of her due date. The Smiths Ford F-150 became stuck underneath a semi-truck for two and a half hours after it jack-knifed. A picture of the scene above 

Dangerous: At least eight vehicles were involved in the accident, which happened in heavy snow and strong winds

'She was a steady presence, a kind, kind woman,' Van Faasen said. 'Bev was just pure goodness. She never judged, she was always smiling.'

The Ohio State Police say conditions on the road were dangerous when the accident happened, with heavy snow and limited visibility due to the strong winds pushing over open fields on either side of the road. 

Six other people received minor injuries in the crash, but refused medical treatment. 

The accident is under investigation.
