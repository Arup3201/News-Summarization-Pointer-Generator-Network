When Sue Walters was diagnosed with leukaemia, she hoped that the best of medical science would be used to cure it.

What she could never have anticipated was that her life would be saved by an 18-year-old boy from a remote German village.

Sue’s only chance of survival was a stem cell transplant — previously known as a bone marrow transplant. 

‘What Nicola has done is amazing — it really is a gift of life. If I hadn’t had the transplant, it was unlikely I’d have lived beyond three months,' said Sue Walters of her donor Nicola Gerber

This would give her a new, stronger immune system to destroy the cancerous cells in her blood.

No one in her family matched her tissue type, so doctors searched the worldwide donor register — and found Nicola Gerber, a student from Mechern, near the French border. 

He had recently registered as a stem cell donor, and was the perfect match.

Thanks to Nicola, Sue has made a full recovery. The two began writing to each other a year after the transplant and recently met for the first time when Nicola flew from Germany to see Sue.

‘What Nicola has done is amazing — it really is a gift of life,’ says Sue, who broke down in tears when he walked into the room. 

‘If I hadn’t had the transplant, it was unlikely I’d have lived beyond three months.’

Sue’s husband Humphrey, her son Mark and daughter-in-law Maria were all there to show their enormous gratitude. 

‘What’s remarkable is for a young guy like this to have the social awareness to do something like that,’ says Humphrey.

For Nicola the reward is seeing Sue in good health. 

‘She looks so well and so happy,’ he says. ‘It’s a good feeling.’

The story behind his decision to donate is extraordinary. In 2011, a man in his village was diagnosed with leukaemia and needed a stem cell transplant.

‘Half the village — about 300 people — got checked to see if they were a match and one was found,’ says Nicola, now 21 and studying engineering. 

‘I registered and though I wasn’t a match, three months later I got a letter saying there was another person who needed my cells.

‘I was told it was a lady from England. I was happy to help,’ he says.

Sue, 74, was diagnosed with acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) — aggressive cancer of the white blood cells — in July 2011 after a blood test showed up abnormalities.

About 2,600 people in Britain are diagnosed with this form of leukaemia each year. It’s most common in the over 60s.

‘She looks so well and so happy. It’s a good feeling,' said Nicola

‘The diagnosis was a huge shock,’ says Sue, who lives in West London and has two children, Claudia and Mark, and three grandchildren. 

‘I wanted to know if I was going to die and my doctor said: “Do not go and Google this.” To this day I have never looked.’

She adds: ‘Initially, I did cry, but soon I thought: “I’ve got to get a grip on this.” I never asked about my prognosis. I had complete confidence in the wonderful doctors and nurses. 

'It’s only since the transplant that I’ve realised how close to death I was.’

Sue began two courses of chemotherapy, each involving a five-week hospital stay.

Her doctor explained that while they could control her cancer with chemotherapy, the only cure was the transplant.

Stem cells are ‘master’ cells that can develop into a variety of different cells — those in the bone marrow turn into blood cells. 

These play a crucial role in the immune system, and in leukaemia, all these cells become abnormal, says Dr Mike Potter, consultant haematologist at the Royal Marsden Hospital and the London Clinic, who treated Sue.

‘Chemotherapy can reduce the cancer, but it can’t destroy it completely. In a stem cell transplant, cells travel to the centre of the bones and start making new blood cells able to fight the cancer that’s left over from the chemo.’

Essentially, the patient’s blood and immune system is replaced by the donor’s. 

During Sue’s second course of chemotherapy, she was told a donor had been found.

‘I was just told it was a young German boy of 18 and that was a bit of a strange thought,’ says Sue, who works for her husband, a motivational speaker and performance coach in business and sport.

About 2,000 people in Britain need a stem cell transplant for leukaemia and lymphoma — cancers of the blood — and other blood disorders, such as sickle cell anaemia. Often, it is their last hope of survival.

Patients can receive a stem cell transplant only from someone who matches their tissue type or else the body rejects it, says Dr Potter.

‘There are 22 million volunteers in the world and, for every patient, there are usually just one or two donors who match and sometimes none,’ he says.

Around a million Britons are registered as stem cell donors, but there’s a desperate need for more. 

Only 60 per cent of patients in need of a transplant find the best possible match, according to the charity Anthony Nolan.

There is a particular shortage of young, male donors and those of ethnic minority.

'It’s only since the transplant that I’ve realised how close to death I was,’ said Sue

It’s possible to perform a stem cell transplant using a donor who is a less-than-perfect match, but the risks of rejection are higher.

Stem cells used to be collected via a needle into the bone marrow, an operation involving a general anaesthetic, which caused considerable pain for days afterwards. 

Now they can be taken from the blood without an anaesthetic.

Before donating his cells Nicola had to inject himself in the stomach twice a day for three days with a drug that stimulates stem cells to come out from the bone marrow and into the blood. 

‘It didn’t hurt, but it’s uncomfortable when you feel the stem cells coming out — like a pressure in my chest and back,’ he says.

He then travelled to a hospital in Frankfurt to have cells harvested during a three-hour procedure. Blood was removed via a tube into his arm and into a machine, which removed the stem cells before the blood was returned to a tube in his other arm.

About ten to 15 litres of blood were removed, then returned. Nicola says it was painless, and while some donors feel very tired afterwards, he felt fine.

His cells were flown straight to London — the transplant must be done within 48 hours as the cells have a lifespan of only 72 hours.

Sue was prepared with high-dose chemotherapy to wipe out her immune system so her body would accept the new cells. 

Though her donor was a perfect match, the transplant still carried a 20 per cent risk of her dying, due to infection or rejection of the cells. 

The transplant on November 25, 2011 was just like a blood trans-fusion, says Sue.

‘I did have terrible pain in my back for about a week after, which I was told was my body fighting the new stem cells.’

It takes three weeks for the donor immune system to start working, and with her own immune system in decline, Sue was kept in hospital. 

'She was discharged on Christmas Eve, feeling ‘very weak’.

Gradually, her new immune system started to fight the leukaemia. By the summer, Sue’s strength had returned and she now feels extremely well.

It’s not until after five years that you can say someone is ‘cured’ — but at three years, Sue is ‘in a very good position’, says Dr Potter.

She still takes antiviral and antibiotic drugs as a precaution.

A year after the transplant, she received a letter through the London Clinic from Nicola, though their names couldn’t be revealed to each other until two years had passed (to avoid distress for the donor and recipient).

‘It was a very sweet letter,’ she says. ‘He just said: “I’m really glad to help you.” ’

They exchanged Christmas cards and then decided to meet.

‘I’d wanted to know where my stem cells had gone,’ says Nicola. ‘I wanted to know if it worked.’

He says the decision to donate was a simple one. ‘If you have the chance to help someone, you should do it,’ he says.
