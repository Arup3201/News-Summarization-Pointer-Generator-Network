A four-year-old Texas boy is fighting for his life after his mother allegedly beat and stabbed him repeatedly, mutilating his genitals in a brutal attack outside of the family's home on Thursday.

Jenea Mungia, 23, has been charged with injury to a child after she alleged stabbed her son all over his body in their Houston home before dragging the boy out into the driveway to finish the assault, ABC reported. 

Once outside, Mungia allegedly beat the boy with a garden tool.

At a probable cause hearing held on Friday, prosecutors said the little boy suffered 'multiple stab wounds to the torso, contusions to the head from blunt force trauma and his genitals were partially mutilated,' KHOU reported. 

Mungia did not appear in court. 

A FedEx driver passing the house around 1pm saw the assault and immediately called 911.

'I thought she was giving him CPR,' the driver told Click 2 Houston. 'But then she started slamming his head on the edge of the concrete driveway.'

Police say Mungia was still attacking the boy when they arrived at the scene. They struggled to get Mungia off of him, the driver said. 

One cop eventually had to kick her off of the child. Police tackled Mungia and arrested her.

A deputy told Click 2 Houston that the 23-year-old was naked from the waist up when the police arrived. Officers found blood inside the house and on the driveway where a bloody shirt lay on the pavement.

Mungia was taken in for questioning and a mental health evaluation after the incident. She is being held at Harris County Jail without bail, charged with injury to a child with serious bodily injury.

The 23-year-old lived with her son, her parents, and her younger sister in the two-story home. Family friends, shocked by the incident, described Mungia as a 'good mom,' the Houston Chronicle reports.

However, a longtime friend of the family said Mungia struggled with post-partum psychosis since her son's birth but thought that Mungia had been treated and everything was under control.

Neighbors stood shocked as the boy was loaded aboard the chopper in the otherwise peaceful town. One mother even pulled her one-year-old son close to her as she watched.
