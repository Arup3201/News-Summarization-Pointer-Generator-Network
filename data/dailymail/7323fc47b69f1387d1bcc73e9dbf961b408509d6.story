A record 2.2million customers complained to Britain’s biggest banks in the first six months of the year – an average of one every seven seconds.

The big high street names – Lloyds Banking Group, Royal Bank of Scotland, Barclays, Santander and HSBC – were deluged with complaints about mis-sold insurance, investments and mortgages, official figures revealed yesterday.

The biggest offender was Lloyds Banking Group, which includes Lloyds TSB, Halifax and Bank of Scotland.

Complaints leapt between January and June this year to 858,850 – a 145 per cent increase on the same period in 2011.

And state-backed rival RBS, which owns NatWest, received 491,735 complaints in the same period.

Customer confidence in Britain’s scandal hit banks is at an all-time low.

They have been forced to compensate millions of customers sold useless payment protection insurance – a type of cover taken out with loans and credit cards. Barclays has been found guilty of rigging interbank lending rates and fined £290million.

It also faces a Serious Fraud Office investigation into its £4.5million capital injection from Qatari investors during the credit crunch.

In June up to 12million RBS customers were locked out of their current accounts after a computer problem.

Justin Modray, of financial website CandidMoney, said: ‘Banks seem to have a total disregard for their customers.

‘They might project a friendly face, but behind the scenes they’re pressuring staff to hit ambitious sales targets which inevitably leads to mis-selling, a key cause for complaint.

‘There’s too much focus on short term profits to support fat bonuses and appease impatient shareholders. Until that culture changes the complaints will keep on rolling in.’

Marc Gander, founder of campaigning organisation the Consumer Action Group, said: ‘Once again complaints have reached new record levels, yet the banks try to tell us that everything is better than it really is.

‘Banks treat us as cash cows and take us for fools but no one is surprised anymore. We need some real competition on the high street.’

The Financial Services Authority, the City watchdog, requires banks to publish the number of complaints they have received every six months.

The latest figures, for January to June this year, reflect the millions of customers who have complained about mis-sold PPI. Banks have set aside an estimated £9billion to refund these customers.

Barclays, which this week announced a new chief executive, Antony Jenkins, on an £8.6million pay package, received 442,266 complaints, an increase of 76 per cent. Mr Jenkins was boss of the bank’s credit card arm, Barclaycard, during the time of the PPI mis-selling.

Spanish bank Santander received 240,597 complaints, and HSBC 170,926 complaints.

This week, customers of Ulster Bank – part of RBS –  were offered £19 compensation after the computer crash in June left customers locked out of their accounts for a whole month.

The small payouts will be handed over to personal current account holders who were forced to visit a branch to carry out a transaction during the IT crisis between June 19 and July 18.

In contrast, Ross McEwan, its new retail banking boss who will oversee current accounts and other products, is to receive a £3.2million golden hello.

The banks argue many of the complaints about payment protection insurance are not valid and are submitted by customers who are hoping for a compensation pay out but were not mis-sold their policies.

A spokesman for the British Bankers’ Association said: ‘Banks take customer complaints very seriously and are working hard to ensure they offer customers high quality products and services.

‘But, despite all efforts and in an industry which processes millions of transactions every single day, things regrettably can sometimes go wrong.

‘No one likes to feel they have let their customers down but there is much to be learned from complaints data and our members will be using the information to help make things better.’
