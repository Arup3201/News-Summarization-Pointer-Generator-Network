A wealthy English businessman who inherited a picturesque Scottish island has given it back to the locals as a gift.

Fred Taylor, a restaurant owner currently living in London, was given ownership of the Outer Hebridean island of Scalpay off Harris in 1998 following the death of his father John.

Residents voted to take over the running of the island yesterday after the offer of the land for free.

Mr Taylor - who owns a family home on the island and has been a frequent visitor - offered 
the gift to its 322 residents and 
encouraged them to take control of their own destiny.

Islanders sanctioned a community ballot and voted 197-8 in favour when the ballot closed on Tuesday. It is the largest 'gifted' community land acquisition in Scotland.

Ballot papers were sent out to around 250 islanders who were eligible to vote.

Fred Taylor's father, John, was a London-based architect and bought the island in 1976 from Sir Hereward Wake.

The late Mr Taylor and his wife Sue used to bring their dog Tilly to the island twice every year.

When he died in 1998, it was passed on to his son Fred, along with the nearby island of Sgeotasaigh, or Scotsay, which his father bought in 1965, and where his family also spent their holidays.

Fred plans to move to the island of Scotsay permanently after building a property there.

Now the residents on the small island of Scalpay - spanning 2.5 miles long - have avoided struggling to raise a purchase price as their only expense is legal fees.

The inhabitants have decided to join in 
partnership with the neighbouring community-run North Harris Trust - 
which was subject to a taxpayer-funded £2.2m buyout in 2003 - in 
managing Scalpay.

Islanders had been told that the island is at risk of eventually being transferred to another organisation as Mr Taylor 'does not wish for the status quo to continue indefinitely.'

The 60 residents who attended a recent 
public meeting were told of the potential to regenerate Scalpay - which 
has a high elderly population.

The island’s population of 320 has almost halved since the 1970s and 80s.

Western Isles MSP, Alasdair Allan, welcomed the result of the ballot. He said: 'I believe that this opens up new opportunities for an island which knows that it needs new economic development.'

Paul Finnegan of Scalpay Community Land Transfer Steering Group, said there were regeneration plans for the island including the old school building which closed in June after its roll fell to just four pupils.

He said: 'One suggestion that has come forward is to use them for business units for small craft workshops.'

'We’ve already identified three people who live on Scaplay who are keen to take them on.'

Sandra Holmes from Highlands and Islands Enterprise outlined what could be achieved.

Boosting tourism, developing fisheries and installing wind turbines are ideas being considered.

Finlay MacRae, secretary of the Scalpay Community Land Transfer Steering Group, said that Scalpay was unlike any of the other community buyouts who had to fight and raise money to buy their land.

He said: 'We are unique in that sense. The recent meeting was very positive.'

The island is officially owned by the Taylor family trust, the Sue Taylor Settlement Trust.

Fred is the sole trustee and he is also offering give away the glebe park adjacent to Scalpay Lighthouse and the former Ministry of Defence tracking site, both owned by him.

In the 1970s Scalpay was an important fishing community but the fleet has since declined and there are little job opportunities on the island.

The isle boasts a strong network of community organisations and has a recently-opened community run shop and cafe, mini-bus service and a community centre.

In 1997 the island - which once had a population of 600 - was joined to neighbouring Harris by a £6.4m bridge.

There also used to be a salmon factory which was a major local employer from 2001 until closure in 2005.

But Scalpay could become a significant centre for yachts visiting the Western Isles if plans go ahead to take the island into community ownership, says a feasibility study carried out by consultants.

The report highlights that the principal attraction of the island is the historic Eilean Glas lighthouse and there is potential to upgrade the footpath to it as well as creating an improved coastal round-island walk.

Mr Taylor told a local magazine, Island Life, in January that he had no intention of cutting ties to the Outer Hebrides if Scalpay’s residents were to take him up on the offer of their land.

He said is was intending to move to the neighbourhood permanently.

He has built a home on his inherited island of Scotsay. The property is a new eco-friendly, off-the-grid home complete with rainwater collectors and a wind turbine, where he intends to live full time.

In his interview in Island Life, Taylor said that he was looking forward to being part of the local community, and has many friends on the island of Harris.

He told the magazine that despite Scotsay being a private island it does not have to feel remote, as it’s just an 8-10 minute boat trip from Scalpay and Harris – more like 'having a wet driveway,' he said.

It was reported that Taylor sees great potential for Scalpay.

He has considered prospective renewable forestry and energy projects, and one of his ideas for regenerating of Scalpay’s industries is to create an offshore lobster hatchery to replenish its fishing grounds.

He told the magazine he had many fond memories of the place. He said: 'I spent a lot of time there when I was a kid.

'It seemed like we were going to the ends of the earth and that was what was so exciting about it.'

Meanwhile, earlier this week a flamboyant aristocrat who left a £1million island to the National Trust of Scotland had his gift rejected.

Count Robin de la Lanne-Mirrlees, whose bed-hopping, colourful life was said to be the model for James Bond, wanted to leave ownership of Little Bernera off the coast of the Isle of Lewis to the nation, but in a rare decision the NTS rejected the offer.

The conservation charity said they rejected the island because Little Bernera is not 'significant' enough to warrant the cost it would take to keep.
