A six-year-old girl was taken to hospital after drinking from a bottle of milk which her parents said was contaminated with glue.

Jessica Bamford of Devonport, Plymouth, was drinking the full fat milk when a 'white hardened substance' formed in and around her mouth, according to her mother.

She screamed and spat it out and was taken to Plymouth's Derriford Hospital.

There, doctors said the mystery substance 'smelt like false nail glue'.

Jessica's mother Samantha, 31, who has five other children, said she was left with glue all over her fingers after the incident.

The youngster was understandably shaken up afterwards and was left with red marks where the substance had been.

Fortunately Jessica didn't swallow any of the mystery substance. Her father Dwain had bought the milk from an Iceland store in Plymouth the previous day.

Samantha, from Devonport, Plymouth, said: 'It's just disgusting. She freaked out and was very shaken.

'She remembers spitting it out in the sink the second she felt something was wrong. It's just lucky she didn't ingest it because this could have been a completely different situation.' 

Jessica unscrewed the blue top and took a sip straight from the carton, when the milk began solidifying in her mouth, her mother said.

Iceland has said it was sorry to hear about the incident but the frozen food chain wishes to investigate further

Jessica is back to her usual self but her mother Samantha wants an apology from Iceland where she was a frequent customer

'I've tried contacting the Iceland store and Trading Standards. Iceland said I have to have a hospital note and then I can send the milk back and they will check for contaminants.

'But thousands of people buy from Iceland every day and the milk is still on the shelves. Surely that can't be just.

Jessica no longer has milk and cereal for breakfast and has switched to toast

'I would recommend people check their milk beforehand to be sure.'

Disgusted Samantha said she has also contacted the dairy but told to contact Trading Standards.

Derriford Hospital in Plymouth, Devon, have told the family it will take seven days from Jessica being admitted to send out an official note confirming she was treated there.

She said: 'By then the milk will be gone off and it will be contaminated anyway.

'I have six children and I am constantly buying from Iceland to save money. It's easy and convenient.

'I always go there, but it's just disgusting and it puts you off.

'If she had swallowed, it would have been a really major situation. I just want an apology but I haven't even had that.'

Jessica has now returned to full health but has now swapped her normal breakfast of cereal for toast.

A spokesperson from Iceland said: 'We are sorry to hear about this issue, but we would like the chance to investigate.

'We would advise she call our customer call team so they can investigate the matter further.'
