This is the moment a brazen thief was captured on CCTV calmly walking out of a Tesco Extra with a widescreen 52-inch TV tucked under his arm.

The raider - wearing a distinctive orange and blue checked shirt - entered the store at Cross Point Business Park in Walsgrave, Coventry, on July 4.

Incredibly, he then proceeded to pick up a huge £649 TV and wandered out of the main entrance.
