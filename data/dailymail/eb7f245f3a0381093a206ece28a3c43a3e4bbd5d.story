Are there ways to help you and your partner orgasm at the same time?

The myth of the simultaneous orgasm is still clutching onto the bed sheets tenaciously - and judging by the amount of couples on telly still moaning 'Yes! Yes! Yes!' in unison, it's going to hang on there for some time yet.

The reality is, you'd be hard pressed to find the same scene recreated in bedrooms at home because couples rarely climax together.

Let's take a look at the facts. Roughly 75% of men in relationships always have an orgasm with their partner, compared to 30% of women.

Men's orgasms last around 5-10 seconds (if he's lucky), women's orgasms can last 15 seconds or more (much more, if she's lucky and he's adept).

Do the math and you'll soon see the chances of both of you orbiting into orgasmic ecstasy at exactly the same moment is highly unlikely. Romantic, yes. Likely, no.

Quite frankly, taking turns - you have your orgasm first, he has his later - is not only more practical, it's sometimes a lot more satisfying.

Having an orgasm is a selfish experience: you're totally and utterly fixated on your own pleasure. Having to pay attention to your partner's bits to guarantee they're enjoying themselves at exactly the same moment doesn't enhance the experience, it interferes with it

For men, this is less of a problem. Their orgasms are easier to trigger and once triggered, continue.

Women's require a lot more attention and, unless tended from start to finish, can halt or merely trickle away halfway through.

While he's twitching and moaning with orgasmic joy, we're often twitching and moaning with resentment at having been robbed at the last moment.

Yes simultaneous orgasm can be an incredibly bonding moment but you're still better off making it a pleasant bonus rather than an aim.

Simultaneous orgasms are, largely, a myth

Get him to have an orgasm first and make the 'together' orgasm the second one. Most men find they have much better control second time around.

Ignore the old advice of getting him to think about big pants or count backwards. The aim is distraction but it simply doesn't work. New research shows even as he's manically saying '459, 458' in his brain, another part is saying 'What does he think I am, stupid? As if this is going to grab my attention when I've got a pair of breasts bobbling in front of me, my penis is nestled in a nice, warm, sexy place, my girlfriend's moaning and throwing her head back and….'

Use the bridge manoeuvre: This is the technique most sex therapists recommend. The basic idea is to give you clitoral stimulation up to the point of, but not actually to, orgasm and let his thrusting trigger off the orgastic reflex. This effectively provides a 'bridge' between clitoral stimulation and intercourse.

Choose the right position. Woman on top or him from behind are the most likely positions to stimulate the front vaginal wall and up your chances of a penetrative orgasm.

@highlight

Talk lots, telling each other exactly where you're at by using a number system. Groaning out a 'Nine!' or delivering a curt 'Still two' might seem odd to start, but it's a quick and effective way to communicate in bed.

@highlight

Switch stimulation regularly. Not only will it keep you both hovering rather than climbing steadily toward a climax, it stops sex becoming too orgasm focused. Change positions. Change rooms. Change the CD. Anything to change the mood, keeping it hot and sexy but maintaining a measure of control.

Make friends with her vibrator. If you asked me the best tip I could possibly give you to achieve simultaneous orgasm, this would be it. One of you holding a wand vibrator (slim, cylindrical, non-intrusive) over the clitoral area during penetrative sex is the most effective way to ensure a shared orgasm experience.
