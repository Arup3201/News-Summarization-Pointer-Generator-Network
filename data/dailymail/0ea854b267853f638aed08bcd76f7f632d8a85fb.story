A mother has spoken for the first time since losing her legs and fingers from a dog bite infection as she learns to walk again.

Mother-of-four Robin Sullins, 48, of Austin, Texas, who owns a chihuahua, a terrier and a boxer lab, was breaking up a fight between one of her dogs and her daughter Hannah's pet on Christmas Day when she was bitten.

She failed to notice that she had been scratched until two days later when she became seriously ill. Her condition rapidly deteriorated and she fell into a coma before doctors were forced to carry out the amputations.

Road to recovery: Ms Sullins, from Texas, is fighting back from her devastating illness with the support of her loving family

Eight months on, the brave mother is learning to walk again with prosthetic legs and the loving support of her partner, children and two grandchildren.

Ms Sullins has a fundraising website set up to help with her rehabilitation and living costs.

She told KHOU this week: 'I feel really blessed to be here. I'm here because people wanted me here. People prayed and stayed and wanted me to be here.'

However she is determined not to allow her devastating injuries prevent animal lovers from owning a cat or dog. 

Her website describes how Ms Sullins' pet dogs 'are her best friends' and says she's rescued more 'four-footers than we can count'.

Ms Sullins was infected with Capnocytophaga Canimorsus, a bacteria commonly found in the mouths of healthy cats and dogs and not normally dangerous.

However, an unusual reaction left her having to have both her legs amputated below the knees and all her fingers removed apart from her thumb.

Ms Sullins' daughter Hannah was eight months pregnant at the time her mother fell dangerously ill. Hannah had a little girl named Averie Rose on January 24 this year.
