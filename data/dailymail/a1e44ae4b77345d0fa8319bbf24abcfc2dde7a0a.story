A father has poignantly recorded the lonely terror of having a baby born prematurely in a photo series taken as he waited nervously for news about both his wife and son.

Stranded in the hospital waiting room, Sao Paulo photographer Diego Saldiva started taking images for his moving series Break of Day.

The photos record his isolation and fears from the silent hospital telephone to his canteen dinner as well as images of his wife’s scars, intimidating medical equipment and a lonely unused pram and children’s toys. 

Tiny: Little Emilio was born weighing around two pounds at seven months

Fighter: The four-year-old now undergoes regular tests but has come on leaps and bounds and suffers no major complications

Saldiva’s son Emilio was born at seven months to his mother, Saldiva’s wife, Noemie in summer 2010. He weighed just a kilo.

His baby went on to suffer further health complications as his powerless father watched and waited. It was those feelings of despair that prompted Saldiva to pick up a camera.

‘I worked on this project from when I got the news I was going to be a father, the beginning of 2010. Of course I had no idea of what would happen next: urgent c-section, premature baby, and all the process of getting to know the he was sick, which was probably the most difficult part,’ he told dailymail.com.

Tension: Diego Saldiva's series documenting the birth of his son captures the tension and the long wait for news

Isolated: The Sao Paulo photographer captures the boredom and loneliness of the hospital

Sadness: The photo series shows strewn toys and other items Saldiva and his wife had bought in excited anticipation for the birth of their son

Hospitalized: Diego Saldiva was left fearing the worst as his wife was rushed to hospital at seven months pregnant to undergo a C-Section

‘We didn't know what was coming next. I was compelled to take pictures because it was a situation that started some contradictory feelings in me, as being a father for the first time and not being able to hold my child, or to see it isolated from the world you were supposed to offer. The chaos of the world kinds of push some human beings to create, and I think it was my case.’

‘There was mostly moments of waiting. Which created a lot of expectations on me and us. I think using the flash was a way to release some kind of tension.’

Thankfully Emilio, now aged four, is a flourishing little boy although the family still have to make regular hospital visits due to health issues from his prematurity.

Alone: Saldiva said the uncertainty of the situation was one of the hardest things he had to cope with and pushed him to create images

Emergency: Saldiva took intimate photos of his wife Noemie for the series as she waited for news about her child

Reminders: The series documents the everyday objects which served as a haunting reminder of what the photographer was waiting to hear about

Clinical: Saldiva's images show a cold, sterile world which echo of the experience inside the hospital

Clinical: The photographer wandered the halls of the hospital and outside the building for the series
