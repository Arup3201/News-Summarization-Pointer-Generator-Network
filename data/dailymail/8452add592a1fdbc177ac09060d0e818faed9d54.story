New information has been uncovered about the criminal pasts of Misty and Daniel Morrissey, whose 10-year-old daughter Lyric Cook went missing along with her eight-year-old cousin Elizabeth Collins almost a week ago.

Court records from Black Hawk County, Iowa show that both parents have multiple drug convictions and Misty was sentenced to four years in federal prison for helping to run a methamphetamine drug ring.

Indeed, the couple have said that they have been questioned repeatedly by police investigating the disappearance of their daughter saying, 'You tell them the truth and they say, 'You're holding something back,' and you're not.'

The Evansdale couple have commented that the extensive nature of the police inquiry has made them feel like they were under investigation in the case of missing Lyric and Elizabeth.

'It made me feel like, 'Yeah, they're looking at me like a suspect,' said Morrissey to ABC News.

The pair's criminal records are chequered and Misty was only released from prison on May 30 after serving time for nine different crimes, including illegal drug use, association with persons involved in criminal activity, excessive alcohol use and failure to comply with drug testing.

In addition, eight years prior to that in 2003, Misty was sentenced to four years in jail after pleading guilty to conspiracy to manufacture and distribute methamphetamine.

The sentence was later commuted to five months in prison and a full year of supervised release.

Other criminal convictions belonging to Misty include a 1998 ticket for having an open container of alcohol in a vehicle and in 1997 she entered a guilty plea for making a false report to police, a crime which cost her six days in prison.

Morrissey is facing a September trial in Black Hawk County after his arrests for drug possession that date from last year.

A look back into court records reveals the depths into which Misty had fallen as she became involved in the meth trade.

Working for a David Mickelson, her former boss at the BIG Ten Mart in Waterloo, Iowa, Misty was a key member of the drugs ring eight years ago.

'Cook testified that she obtained pseudoephedrine pills from various people and provided them to Scott Reavis, who used them to make methamphetamine,' court records stated to the Des Moines Register

In fact, Morrissey stormed out of a long interview with law enforcement officials after they point blank accused him of killing Lyric Cook and Elizabeth Collins, the girl's grandmother said.

'Yeah, there's history in our family, but it's not a history that we're scared of,' said 36-year-old Misty.

'It's one we've dealt with. It's one we've come past and we've come past it as a family so no matter what anybody thinks about it, it's not one that has anything to do with you know, the disappearance of our children.'

Rallying against the speculation that she and Morrissey may have been responsible for the deaths of Lyric and Elizabeth, Misty was adamant that their focus should be elsewhere.

'We want everybody in the main part of the criminal investigation who has the authority or the power to do things and make decisions, we want them focused on our girls and what might have happened to them,' said Misty.

'You know but if looking into our history is what's needed then that's fine, too.'

The revelations of the couples criminal past comes as the spotlight falls on the investigation into the disappearance of their daughter and Elizabeth Collins.

In an interview with ABC News on Wednesday morning, Misty explained how extensively they have been questioned by the police.

'We've done extensive interviews, hours at a time,' said Misty.

'We've done polygraphs. We have taken many phone calls, answered many questions.

'We've given our phones up.

'All of our data has been, you know, taken off our phones.

'In fact, my sister and my phone is now not - our touch screens aren't working very well.

'So we've cooperated to the fullest, you know.'

An FBI expert and former special agent believes that law enforcement is looking at every angle they can in the case.

'What comes into question is how does that play into what is presently going on in their lives?' said Brad Garrett.

'And more particular, does it have any relationship to these two missing girls?'

It has also been revealed that in the week's before both girl's going missing, Misty and Daniel were having issues at home and were preparing to file for divorce.

'They are not a couple,' said Misty's sister Tammy Brousseau to ABC News.

'They are currently separated and maybe well on the way to a divorce.'

Daniel Morrissey also told reporters of his battle to keep a cool head during this stressful time.

'I'll tell you something about emotions,' said Morrissey.

'A lot of people base their decisions off emotions and it doesn't work out too well.

'They're angry, they make a bad decision, whatever.

'So emotions I try to keep control of and keep my head straight.

'During this time, it's definitely challenging, but I have to keep my mind right.'

Despite the interest from the authorities, Misty and Morrissey have cooperated fully with their investigation.

'They are still continuing to cooperate with us as we would expect,' said Black Hawk County Sheriff's Office spokesman Ricj Abben.

When asked about Morrissey and Misty feeling like suspects in their own daughters disappearance, Abben said he was unsure why.

'I don't know why he feels that way,' said Abben.

'We expect cooperation from everyone - 100 percent cooperation.

'So I don't know why he feels that way.'

Heather and Drew Collins, Elizabeth’s parents, have minor offenses in their backgrounds, an online check of court records shows.

Elizabeth and Lyric were last seen on Friday, riding their bicycles in downtown Evansdale, Iowa.

When they never returned home, hundreds of volunteers spent the weekend looking for the girls, and their bikes were found next to Meyers Lake.

More than 350 volunteers joined the search over the weekend. Teams have been dragging the lake for the past several days but have found nothing.
