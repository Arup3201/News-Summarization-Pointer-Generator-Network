Awkward questions: Google Boss Eric Schmidt speaking at a Google's Big Tent event in Watford this month

The boss of Google has declared himself 'perplexed' by public anger at the internet giant's meagre UK tax contribution.

Eric Schmidt, Google's executive chairman, hit back after politicians criticised the California-based company for generating billions of pounds from its UK arm, but giving precious little back in taxes.

Google paid £10million in UK corporation tax between 2006 and 2011, despite pulling in revenues of £11.9billion.

But Mr Schmidt said the company had done what it was 'legally required' to do and would not pay a penny more than the demanded.

'What we are doing is legal,' he said.

'I'm rather perplexed by this debate, which has been going in the UK for some time, because I view taxes as not optional.'

'I view that you should pay the taxes that are legally required. It's not a debate, you pay the taxes.'

He said that the fault for Google's low tax contribution lay at the door of politicians, who have not tweaked tax laws to catch up with a modern, globalised world.

'If the British system changes the tax laws, then we will comply. If the taxes go up, we will pay more, if they go down, we will pay less.' 'That is a political decision for the democracy that is the United Kingdom,' he told the BBC.

Google boss Mr Schmidt has previously admitted that he 'can't defend' an international tax system that he deems 'irrational'.

But tax expert Richard Murphy, of the Tax Justice Network, said Mr Schmidt wasn't abiding by the law, but simply side-stepping it by routing UK sales through Ireland, where taxes are lower.

'Let's be clear, he's actually not paying the right amount of tax, he's getting round the law. If we change it, he'll try to get around that law,' said Mr Murphy.

He said Mr Schmidt's comments proved 
that Britain needs a General Anti Avoidance Rule, which could be applied
to any attempt to lower tax bills artificially.

'That would have undoubtedly caught their tax avoidance and then Eric Schmidt would have to comply with UK law,' said Mr Murphy.

Mr Schmidt's effort to turn the focus back on politicians comes just days after Google was accused of doing 'evil' by Margaret Hodge MP (Lab, Barking), who chairs the parliamentary Public Accounts Committee looking into corporate tax.

Ms Hodge was referring to the company's famous motto 'Don't be evil', which she said did not stand up to scrutiny given its bargain-basement tax bill.

'You are a company that says you "do no evil". And I think that you do do evil,' she said. Ms Hodge has called for a new committee to oversee the tax affairs of major companies.

She said the committee could hold secret evidence sessions with companies, to allow them to debate tax issues without causing firms any public embarrassment.

Household names such as Amazon and Starbucks have suffered boycotts, as consumers react to revelations of their tiny tax bills by taking their business elsewhere.

Mr Murphy agreed that a special committee should be set up to look solely at tax.

'HM Revenue & Customs doesn't have a minister responsible for it or a committee to review it and yet it's at the centre of British politics,' he said.

'It's time parliament took tax seriously and was given the funds to investigate just what's going on.'

Tax avoidance has moved up the political agenda in recent weeks, ahead of next month's G8 summit of the world's economic superpowers. Chancellor George Osborne is expected to use Britain's presidency of the G8 in 2013 to push for a global agreement on methods to battle tax avoidance.

The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) is also drawing up a blueprint for global tax reform ahead of the larger G20 meeting of developed economies in September.
