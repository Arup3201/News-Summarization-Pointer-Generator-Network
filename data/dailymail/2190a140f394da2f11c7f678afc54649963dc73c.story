A couple with 65 cats have been kicked out of their home after health inspectors found it was jam-packed with rubbish - finding 15 dead cats underneath old bin bags.

Christopher and Elizabeth Blore were ordered out of their property in Kingsbury in Brent, northwest London, after council workers were left staggered at the mess - which reached from floor to ceiling in most rooms.

The couple were told not to return for three months so the council could clear the rubbish up and fumigate the house.

Disgusting: Elizabeth and Christopher Blore kept 65 cats at their home in Brent

Brent Council was made aware of the situation by neighbours more than two years ago after they complained of a ‘putrid smell’, and after a protracted battle with the couple they finally managed to get them out of the house last week.

The council, who will have to remove 30 tons of rubbish from the house between now and August, have successfully won an Asbo against the couple banning them from keeping or feeding cats.

Sergeant Liam Tierney said: 'It was 
only when taking statements from the neighbours that we realised what a 
devastating effect the Blores where having on their everyday lives.

Unbelievable: Brent council will have to remove 30 tonnes of rubbish from the Blore's home between now and August

Shocking: Bin bags were found piled up to the ceiling and empty cans of cat food littered the floor

'I could appreciate at first hand the smell and whilst serving the order I have never come across a property so hazardous to health.'

Cllr Lincoln Beswick, of Brent Council, said he was pushing to get the couple to pay the clean up costs, adding: 'Everyone has the right to the peaceful enjoyment of their home, whether it is privately or socially owned.

'The Blore’s family way of life infringed on their neighbour’s rights, health and wellbeing, so partners worked together to enforce a Nuisance Premises Closure and Asbo.

'Taxpayers should not foot the bill as this family have infringed on their neighbours’ rights, health and wellbeing.'

Carly Webber, of the Mayhew Animal Home, where the 65 cats were taken to for treatment said many had to be put down as they were so ill.

Rotting rubbish: Neighbours first complained to the council about the Blores two years ago

Distressing: Officials found the remains of three dead cats under the unbelievable levels of waste

She said that council workers should ‘expect to find more dead cats’ in the house, adding: 'The filth that they were living in is unbelievable.'

One neighbour, who asked not to be named, said: 'The smell was truly horrendous.

'This couple just took in more and more cats until they completely overran the place and combined with the floor-to-celing rubbish it meant you could smell the house as soon as you turned into the street.'

A spokesman for Brent Council said this week: 'Neighbours had complained about the revolting smell and distressing build up of cat faeces in their gardens and the council’s public health team, who inspected the property on several occasions, found it was full of rotting rubbish and cat faecal matter.

'Since 2010 council environmental officers had taken a number of steps to support the tenants in clearing the property, however Mr and Mrs Blore had continued to ignore notices and advice about dealing with the build up of rubbish and the welfare of the cats.

'During the clear up, enforcement officers also discovered the decomposed remains of dead cats.'

The couple are due to be allowed back into the house on August 23.
