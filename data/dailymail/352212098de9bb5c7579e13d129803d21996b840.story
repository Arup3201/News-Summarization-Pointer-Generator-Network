Manchester United goalkeeper David de Gea says he is trying to convince Spain team-mate Cesc Fabregas to move to Old Trafford.

The United No 1 is preparing for the World Cup with his Spanish team-mates, but already has one eye on next season.

Former Arsenal midfielder Fabregas was linked with a move to United last summer, but stayed at Barcelona.

And De Gea says it will be tough to convince the midfielder to move this summer.

He told La Sexta: 'I’ve tried to convince Cesc to join United but it’s difficult. He feels great at Barca, it’s his home.'

De Gea is training with the Spain squad ahead of Friday's friendly with Bolivia, and with Real Madrid's Iker Casillas not in contention due to his participation in the Champions League final, De Gea will fight it out with Pepe Rena for the No 1 spot and a chance to make his debut.

He added: 'We don’t know who’s going to play against Bolivia, but we have to be ready in case we get the nod.

'I’m raring to make my debut. There’s a lot of competition in goal, but I’m enjoying myself and pushing myself to the max in training.

'There’s a lot of speculation about who will go to Brazil and who won’t. A few players are carrying fitness issues and we just have to wait for the gaffer to make his decision: it’s as simple as that.'
