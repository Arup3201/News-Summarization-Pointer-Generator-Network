Google Glass has caused controversy with concerns its recording capability is a breach of privacy

Google Glass users have been warned they risk breaking the law by using the devices to film people secretly.

The data privacy watchdog has told buyers of the £1,000 ‘wearable technology’ that they could be prosecuted if they mis-use recordings, or face fines of up to £500,000.

The Information Commissioner's Office said wearers are effectively covered by the same rules as CCTV cameras, meaning they cannot record people on their glasses and show the films publicly unless they have consent.

The warning comes after the devices went on sale in Britain for the first time this week.

Andrew Paterson, senior technology officer, warned that using the recording capability of Google Glass for anything other than personal use was forbidden unless the wearer had given warning in advance.

Much like a smartphone, the wearable Google Glass provides information and recordings via a display screen inside the glasses' lens.

By issuing the voice command 'Ok, Glass' - said to have been the brainchild of Google co-founder Sergey Brin's new girlfriend - you can activate it and then issue voice commands, including recording video and taking photographs.

An early version of the device has just 
been released to the UK public despite the controversy and privacy 
concerns raised during its release in the U.S.

Mr Paterson, who works for the Information Commissioner's Office, wrote that using the technology strictly for your own use would be unlikely to breach data privacy laws.

Glass Explorer

The term Google has given to Google Glass users. As the company rolls out its early version for the general public, those willing to be among the first to use it have been marketed as pioneering revolutionaries whose purchase will contribute to the final product's design.

Ok, Glass

The phrase a Google Glass wearer uses when wearing the product to activate the glasses and issue a voice command.

Glass hole

An obvious spin on the more common phrase for someone who is a pest, obnoxious, rude or a jerk - specifically, one wearing Google Glass.

Glass out

The term given to those who appear to be staring vacantly into the distance while they are focusing on their Google Glass display screen. This falls under Google's 'do not' category and is considered poor etiquette.

This is 
because the laws include an exemption for the collection of personal 
information for domestic purposes.

'But
 if you were to one day decide that you’d like to start using this 
information for other purposes outside of your personal use, for example
 to support a local campaign or to start a business, then this exemption
 would no longer apply.'

He warned that organisations' use of wearable technology were an entirely different proposition to individuals.

'They must process the information collected by these devices in compliance with the legislation,' he said.

'This includes making sure that people are being informed about how their details are being collected and used, only collecting information that is relevant, adequate and not excessive and ensuring that any information that needs to be collected is kept securely and deleted once it is no longer required.'

If the organisation was recording video or pictures, then it must consider the issues raised in the CCTV Code of Practice, he said.

The product's rollout in the 
U.S. has been far from smooth, with reports of users being publicly assaulted and San Francisco bars banning the product due to 
concerns from their patrons about being filmed without their consent.

Google said: 'We designed Glass with privacy in mind and given the similarities between the functionality of a smartphone and Glass we expect the same rules to apply. The fact that Glass is worn above the eyes and the screen lights up whenever it’s activated clearly signals it’s in use and makes it a fairly lousy surveillance device.'
