Under former boss Sir Alex Ferguson, Manchester United were notorious for their late goals that would either see them salvage a point or more than likely win a match.

However, this season it is Tottenham who have that handy knack of never knowing when they are beaten.

Spurs have earned 13 points with goals scored after the 85th minute in the Premier League this season - more than any other club.

However, the 21-year-old was on hand to tuck away the rebound and rescue Spurs' 13th late point of the term 

Mauricio Pochettino's men left it late once more on Sunday as Harry Kane's injury-time strike rescued a 2-2 draw against bitter London rivals West Ham.

It is the second time this month that the 21-year-old has bailed out the White Heart Lane outfit following his dramatic winner in their 2-1 north London derby win at home to Arsenal.

The never-say-die attitude at Tottenham has proved pivotal to their season so far.

Without those late goals Spurs, would be sitting 12th in the table - but instead they are seventh and in with a shout of securing Champions League football.

Along with United and Manchester City they are also the only team to have not dropped any points by conceding late on in matches.

Second on the goalscoring list sits Arsenal, who have collected six points after scoring in the 85th minute, while Aston Villa and West Ham are the only teams to have not gained anything with late goals.

Tim Sherwood's side sit fifth in the rankings for points dropped with goals conceded after 85 minutes. That includes Victor Moses' late penalty to give Stoke a 2-1 win at Villa Park on Saturday

The Villans, who sit 19th in the table, would be four points better off and not in the relegation zone, if they hadn't slipped up late in games.

Hull are the worst offenders for this statistic though - having dropped seven points after conceding late. They’d be 11th had they not.

The Tigers were just moments away from securing their first away win over Manchester City in 85 years earlier this month when David Meyler put them ahead on 35 minutes.

However, Steve Bruce's side were dealt heartache when City midfielder James Milner curled home a magnificent 25-yard free-kick deep into stoppage time to equalise.

Having said that Dame N'Doye 89th minute header gave Hull a 2-1 win over relegation rivals QPR on Saturday.
