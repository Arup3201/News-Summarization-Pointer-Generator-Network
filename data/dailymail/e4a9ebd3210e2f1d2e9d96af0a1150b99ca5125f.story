Ukip was dragged into a fresh hypocrisy row today after it emerged it has been printing anti-EU election leaflets - in Germany.

Nigel Farage's party has campaigned to protect British jobs, slash immigration and pull out of the European Union.

But instead of using a British firm to help the party's campaign it took 'full advantage of the European single market' to place its order abroad.

UKIP leader Nigel Farage, unveiling the party's anti-EU billboard in the run-up to the elections, has faced accusations of hypocrisy after his party used a German company to print its campaign leaflets

Mr Farage, pulling a pint of 'Proper Job' during a visit to the North-east last month, has faced increasing levels of scrutiny following his party's rise to the top of the polls ahead of next week's European elections

The revelation comes after it emerged the party had hired Eastern Europeans to hand out its anti-immigration flyers ahead of next week's European elections.

Latvians were employed by a company called Fast Leaflet in Croydon, south London, to hand out flyers for Mr Farage's party. At the time, Tory MP Gavin Barwell said: 'Ukip’s hypocrisy knows no bounds.'

He added: 'They say they are against Europeans taking our jobs and then, when they have a chance to offer some British people work delivering their leaflets because they can’t find volunteers to do it, they employ European workers.'

It also comes after it emerged that one of the stars of a Ukip poster campaign, who appeared to be a British builder ‘hit hard by unlimited cheap labour’, was actually an Irish actor, Dave O’Rourke.

Mr Farage has also faced personal accusations of double-standards after employing his German wife as his secretary - claiming no Brits would want to work for him.

The Ukip leader said ordinary Brits would not want to put in the same hours as his partner, Kirsten, who is paid £25,000 as his secretary by the European Parliament.

He was challenged over the appointment after he launched a £1.5million poster campaign for the European elections that warned 26 million unemployed Europeans were 'after' British jobs, driving down wages and leaving British workers begging on the streets.

Asked whether there is no British person able to do the job, Mr Farage said: 'No, because I don't think anybody else would want to be in my house at midnight, going through emails, getting me briefed for the next day.

'Nobody else could do that job. I don't know anybody who would work those kinds of hours.'

He added: 'That is a very different situation to the mass of hundreds of thousands of people coming in and flooding the lower ends of the labour market.'

Ukip claimed its poster campaign was a 'hard-hitting reflection of reality' - but it later emerged that it had used an Irish actor to represent a British builder put out of work because of immigration

Ukip's rise in the polls has sparked an increasing number of protests against the party. Nigel Farage's regional organiser in Wales, John Atkinson (centre), was forced to tell supporters in Swansea last month that the party leader would not be turning up because of security issues

Ukip has insisted its latest gaffe, using a foreign firm to print its flyers, was a mistake - blaming the internet for making it hard to know where products are made.

The leaflets were distributed in west London to support Paul Motion, the Ukip council candidate for Hounslow in west London.

They were printed by Saxoprint, a European firm that employs 400 in Britain and have an office in Chiswick.

But according to trade magazine PrintWeek, all of the company’s printing takes place in Germany.

Ukip's Nigel Farage was yesterday roundly attacked for stoking fears that Britain would be swamped by Romanians and Bulgarians. Figures showed that the number of migrants arriving in the UK from the two countries actually fell in the first three months of the year

A Liberal Democrat source it was 'good to see Ukip taking full advantage of the European single market'.

But Ukip's Colin Botterill, who placed the order for the leaflets, said: 'I wasn’t aware of it when we ordered the printing. I saw the Chiswick address and thought “fantastic we’re supporting a local business”.

‘I only found out the company was German when I phoned to chase delivery and asked whether I could pick the leaflets up, and was told they were on a plane from Germany.

‘I was a bit disappointed. This is the problem with the internet, you don’t necessarily know where things are coming from.’

He added: ‘We try and support local businesses and in future we want to use local printers. We will be getting a CV off them first.’

The Labour party has also used Saxoprint for materials that have been delivered to households in Reading, promoting its candidate David Absolom.

A spokesman said: 'The Labour Party uses a range of firms and most of our print is done in the UK.'

Mr Farage has called for an Australian-style points-based system that would only allow skilled people with no criminal records into the country, cutting immigration to 30,000-50,000 people a year.

That could see higher numbers of Indian and New Zealanders coming to Britain but fewer eastern Europeans, he said.

Mike Gapes, the MP for Ilford South, said Ukip's plans to curb immigration would leave Britain resembling Albania, which shut itself off from the rest of the world during the communist era.

Nick Clegg suggested he would not block a referendum in the event of a future coalition

Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg today hinted he would not stand in the way of David Cameron's plans for an in/out referendum on Britain's membership of the European Union in a new coalition after the next general election.

The Liberal Democrat leader said there would be more important issues for him - such as "fairer" taxes - in any coalition negotiations in the event of another hung parliament.

His comments come after Mr Cameron said he would not lead another government after the election next year unless there was a commitment to a referendum before the end of 2017.

While Mr Clegg said he stood by his position that there should not be a referendum unless there was a fresh transfer of powers to Brussels, he indicated that it was not a "die-in-the-ditch" issue for him.

'I am going to disappoint you by not now drawing great red lines," he told the BBC Radio 4 Today programme.

'Are there die-in-the-ditch issues which I have highlighted in the past which I care about, frankly, even more than this? Yes. I think fairer taxes is something I've campaigned for.

'That is something I care about much more than the precise mechanics of when a referendum is held.'

Mr Clegg said that past history suggested there would be changes to the EU treaties which would require a referendum in the UK under legislation passed by the coalition.

'I have always felt that you have a referendum when the time is right, when something happens which merits that referendum," he said.

'If you look back at the development of the European Community, and subsequently the European Union, every few years the rules of the game - these cumbersome treaties - are changed and new decision-making authority is pooled at European level.

'So I think, if history is any guide, it's more than likely to happen again. At that point there should be a referendum, we've guaranteed that in law.'
