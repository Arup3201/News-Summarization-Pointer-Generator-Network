From linen and sheepskin to thick rubber sheaths that stank of sulphur, condoms haven't always been the most comfortable form of contraception.

One of the world's oldest forms of birth control, condoms weren't widely used - much less, accepted - until the 1940s, when the demand for fighting fit syphilis-free soldiers changed the face of contraception forever.

In fact, so popular are they today, there's even a Condom Awareness Week and to celebrate, prophylactic makers Trojan have released a documentary that charts their often fascinating history.

Uncomfortable: This preserved sheepskin condom dates from the Tudor period

Beginning with the earliest condoms in Ancient Egypt, the seven minute film looks at how birth control evolved from an upper class luxury into an everyday essential.

'The history of condoms is very 
complicated,' explains Debra Lynn-Herbenick, Research Scientist and Associate Director at The Kinsey Institute.

'There are so many issues that have helped shape the way we 
feel about this one particular object.

'Some of the earliest examples of condom 
use occurred in Ancient Egypt, where people used linen sheaths to cover 
their penis and protect themselves from all kinds of STDs as well as to 
prevent pregnancy.'

Condoms next appeared in the 17th century, when a syphilis outbreak made them an essential tool for seeing off sexually transmitted diseases, although the prophylactics in use then weren't exactly the sort of thing you would want to use today.

'There's documentation at least as early 
as the 17th century about the widespread use of animal skins,' says James Edmonson, Chief curator at the Dittrick Medical History Center.

Protection: During the Second World War, soldiers were encouraged to use the prophylactics, although troops fighting in the Great War weren't so lucky: they had to use the ineffective Dough-Boy Prophylactic kit (right)

Sexual revolution: In the 1960s and 70s, condoms became more popular - and were more widely available - than ever before

'Today, we use 
the same animal skins to make sausage casings!'

Uncomfortable though the animal skin condoms were, they were hugely popular among the middle and upper classes, but remained out of reach for the rest.

'It might have cost a working person a week's wage to buy a quality condom at the time,' adds Edmonson.

'The big innovation came in 1839 when Charles Goodyear found he could vulcanise or heat treat rubber.'

Cheaper the new rubber condoms might have been but comfortable they were not, as Lynn-Herbenick points out.

'Condoms in the 1850s were as thick as bicycle tyres and they smelled of sulphur,' she explains. 'They weren't exactly inviting!

HIV: The AIDS epidemic of the 80's made condom use more important than ever

Nevertheless, condoms grew in popularity and by the 1850s, they could be purchased by mail order and sent to your home.

But the backlash was about to begin, particularly in the United States, where the 1873 Comstock laws effectively outlawed contraception.

The new rules prevented advertising or sending condoms by post, while 30 different states outlawed the manufacturing and sale of condoms altogether.

As a result disease increased. 'Condoms were effectively forced underground and you couldn't get them in the way you could before,' says Lynn-Herbenick.

'After Comstock, when you couldn't use condoms, the rate of STDs skyrocketed.'

It wasn't until the outbreak of World War One that condoms staged a comeback - mainly in response to the high rate of venereal disease that incapacitated as much as 15 per cent of Allied forces at any one time.

But the majority of condoms were still expensive and uncomfortable, and it was another two years before modern latex condoms were invented - too late for soldiers serving on the Western Front.

The new material did, however, make a difference to troops fighting in the Second World War, when, for the first time, condoms were widely distributed by military authorities.

'By World War Two, condoms were really the main way of preventing venereal disease,' says Lynn-Herbenick.

'It made no sense to leave soldiers vulnerable to sexually transmitted diseases such as syphillis and gonorrhea.'

Widespread wartime use of condoms finally gained them acceptance among wider society, and by the mid 1950s, it is estimated that 60 per cent of British couples were using them regularly.

But it was the sexual revolution of the 1960s that would finally cement their place in Western culture.

'The sexual revolution of the 1960s and 70s meant that a lot of people were having sex with people they didn't necessarily know very well,' explains Lynn-Herbenick. 'It changed the need for sexual protection and meant that the condom took centre stage in [Western] culture - particularly for younger people.'

Safe sex: HIV/AIDS remain a huge problem, and in Africa especially, using condoms really does save lives

Spoilt for choice: Modern consumers no longer have to endure uncomfortable sheepskin and can buy condoms in a huge variety of shapes and sizes

Condoms became more important than ever when, in the 1980s, the HIV/AIDS epidemic arrived.

'In the early 80s, we found out we had a new public heath problem - HIV/AIDS,' says Lynn Barclay, President and CEO of the American Social Health Association.

'Condoms became the difference between life and death. The public health response to HIV and AIDS has meant that condoms are more widely available than ever before.'

Rapid innovation changed the face of condom use in the 1990s and made them more comfortable and easy to use.

Although the latex prophylactics have to compete with a wide variety of birth control methods today, they remain among the most popular and are still the only fail safe way to avoid sexually transmitted diseases.

'Condoms were once a one size fits all kind of object but now they come in various shapes, sizes and colours,' says Lynn-Herbenick.

'When someone goes to the condom aisle of the drug store, they're faced with a number of choices that lets them tweak sex in any way they want to tweak it.'

15,000 BC: The oldest known depiction of a condom is in a painting on the walls of the Grotte des Combarrelles, a cave in France. The paintings are believed to be between 10 and 15,000 years old.

150 AD: Condoms appear in the legend of Minos, written down by Antoninus Liberalis in 150 AD. According to historians, this suggests that condom use was widespread during antiquity.

1494: An outbreak of syphilis decimates the population of Europe, before spreading to Asia where the disease devastated the Chinese people in 1505. Outbreaks such as this were in part due to the rise of modern religions such as Christianity and Islam, which forbade the use of birth control.

1564: Italian doctor Gabriele Falloppio publishes De Morbo Gallico (The French Disease), which was the first medical treatise to suggest the use of condoms as a means of tackling syphilis.

1666: The English Birth Rate Commission ascribes falling birth rates to the use of 'condons' - the first recorded use of the word.

1640: Condoms made from animal intestines have been discovered, which date from the English Civil War. The prophylactics, discovered in a toilet, were believed to have been used by the troops of King Charles I - mainly on each other.

1708: By the 18th century, condom use had become widespread, although they weren't to everyone's taste. John Campbell, 2nd Duke of Argyll, unsuccessfully tried to have them banned in 1708, while in 1717, Daniel Turner, an English doctor, published a text condemning condom use.

1840: Although uncomfortably thick, condoms had become affordable for all and were widely promoted to the working classes - all thanks to the discovery of rubber.

1870: The first major condom manufacturer, E. Lambert and Son of Dalston, opens its doors in London.

1912: German entrepreneur, Julius Fromm, invents a new and speedy way of making condoms called 'cement dipping', which involved adding petrol to rubber to make it liquid before dripping it over a glass mould. Fromm was also the first to make branded condoms.

1914: The German military becomes the first to promote condom use among troops. By the time World War One broke out in 1914, all countries, except the UK and the USA, handed out condoms to their soldiers. As a result, by the end of the war, the US army had been forced to deal with nearly 400,000 cases of STDs.

1920: Latex was invented, revolutionising the condom in the process. Youngs Rubber Company was the first to manufacture a latex condom, which was sold under the Trojan brand.

1932: The London Rubber Company became the first European company to make latex condoms, which they sold under the trade name, Durex.

1941: Germany outlaws civilian use of condoms and directs the country's entire supply to the military. All combatant nations in World War Two provided their soldiers with vast quantities of prophylactics.

1955: Post war, condom use became widespread, with 60 per cent of married British couples and 42 per cent of American pairings regularly using them.

1967: France repeals its birth control laws, followed by Italy in 1971. The last country to get rid of anti-condom laws was the Republic of Ireland, which did so in 1993.

1981: The AIDS epidemic begins, leading to widespread public health campaigns in Western countries between 1985 and 1987. As a result, condom use skyrockets, particularly in Switzerland, where condom use shot up by 80 per cent.

1994: Condom sales begin to decline slightly as the fear of AIDS diminishes in the West. Nevertheless, globally condom use continues to grow, with experts predicting that 18.6 billion will be used every year by 2015.
