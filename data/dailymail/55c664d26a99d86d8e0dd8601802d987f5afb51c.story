Action: Leading world press freedom organisations yesterday urged David Cameron to 'take immediate steps to safeguard press freedom in the UK'

Leading world press freedom organisations yesterday urged David Cameron to persuade Parliament to repeal legislation underpinning the Government’s Royal Charter on press regulation.

In a letter to the Prime Minister, seven major international bodies described the Charter as ‘incomprehensible arcana’ and warned that ‘autocratic’ foreign leaders are already using it to justify repression.

The bodies – including the World Association of Newspapers and News Publishers – urge Mr Cameron to ‘take immediate steps to safeguard press freedom in the UK and to ensure that the actions of your government are never used to justify media restrictions elsewhere in the world’. 

They add: ‘Indeed, it should be a source of serious concern to your government that autocratic leaders seeking to limit media freedom now cite the British example.’ 

The Royal Charter was drawn up by politicians and approved by the Queen in October in the wake of the Leveson Inquiry into alleged wrongdoing by journalists. It underpins with statute a new body to oversee the regulation of the Press, with publications that refuse to comply facing ‘exemplary’ damages in libel cases.

Newspapers and magazines have refused to sign up to the new regime over fears it would bring to an end 300 years of press freedom.

Instead, the Press is establishing a fully independent body to police its activities, known as the Independent Press Standards Organisation. It will be able to impose fines of up to £1million for serious and systematic wrongdoing.

The press freedom organisations – who visited Britain last month – describe the charter as a ‘medieval vestige’ and ‘a convoluted process virtually incomprehensible to anyone not versed in its arcana’.

Their letter said: ‘This Parliamentary action, in our view, establishes statutory underpinning for media regulation. This means that the Rubicon has, in fact, been crossed.

‘It is our view that the Parliamentary action that essentially compels participation in the regulatory mechanism belies claims that it will be “voluntary”.’ 

They told Mr Cameron he should urge Parliament to repeal the statutes that underpin the Royal Charter. The press freedom groups  told the Prime Minister how repressive regimes are already citing the Charter to justify gagging their own critics.

Request: The bodies also asked Mr Cameron to distance himself from the investigation into The Guardian over the leaks by National Security Agency whistleblower Edward Snowden (pictured)

They highlighted Ecuador’s President Rafael Correa who ‘has championed one of the most repressive media laws in all of Latin America’ and who has ‘explicitly invoked the British example in defending his actions’. 

The letter quotes a speech by Correa last year in which he denounced his critics and said: ‘The United Kingdom has created a communication law to regulate the excesses of a certain yellow press in that country.’ 

It also relates how the editor of a newspaper in Pakistan disclosed that officials ‘now routinely cite actions of the British government in pressing the Pakistani media to “self-regulate” or face government action’. 

The press freedom groups tell Mr Cameron: ‘Britain’s democracy, including its robust and diverse media, has been an inspiration to people around the world who struggle to be free, and is a source of British “soft power” and influence.’

Referring to recent examples when Mr Cameron highlighted the dangers and difficulties of journalists working in Somalia and Sri Lanka, they continue: ‘Your ability to exercise this kind of positive influence rests  on the perception that the British media operates free of government interference.

‘Any action that diminishes that perception not only emboldens autocratic leaders to take repressive action against the media but it erodes the ability of Britain to exercise moral suasion.’ 

The letter also asks Mr Cameron to distance himself from the investigation into The Guardian over the leaks by National Security Agency whistleblower Edward Snowden.

It says the Prime Minister should ‘refrain from any public comments to avoid the perception of political pressure’.

Sorry we are unable to accept comments for legal reasons.
