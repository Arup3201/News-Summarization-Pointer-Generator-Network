Harriet Harman today risked a Commons rebuke by wearing a pro-feminism t-shirt to Prime Minister's Questions.

Labour's deputy leader sat next to Ed Miliband on the frontbench wearing the shirt declaring: 'This is what a feminist looks like.'

Parliamentary officials have previously ruled that MPs should not 'use their clothing to display slogans or make debating points'.

David Cameron, pictured in the Commons today, rejected the chance to wear a 'this is what a feminist looks like' T-shirt, sparking anger among women's rights groups

Ms Harman's decision to don the t-shirt will be seen as a rebuke across the Despatch Box to David Cameron, who refused to wear it for a women’s equality campaign.

The Prime Minister rejected the chance to wear a ‘this is what a feminist looks like’ T-shirt – despite being asked five times for ELLE magazine’s inaugural feminism issue.

Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg and the Labour leader Ed Miliband both accepted the challenge – alongside celebrities Benedict Cumberbatch, Joseph Gordon Levitt and Tom Hiddleston.

Before Prime Minister's Questions in the Commons today, Ms Harman tweeted a picture of herself in the grey t-shirt  with the message: 'This is what a feminist will look like at Prime Minister's Questions today.'

However, the rules on what MPs can wear in the Chamber are strict. Last year Green MP Caroline Lucas was rebuked for trying to wear an anti-Page 3 t-shirt during a debate.

A House of Commons spokesman said at the time: 'By convention members are expected not to use their clothing to display slogans or make debating points – members are expected to make their arguments through their speeches.'

The row over Mr Cameron's refusal to wear the feminist t-shirt came after Mr Cameron sparked controversy when being questioned over his support of women.

Last year he was asked by the women’s magazine Red whether he was a feminist.

He paused before replying: ‘I don’t know what I’d call myself… it’s up to others to attach labels. But I believe men and women should be treated equally.’

He was later forced to explain his remarks. He told Channel 4 News: ‘When I was asked that question, what I should have said is, if that means equal rights for women, then yes. If that is what you mean by feminist, then yes, I am a feminist.’

Mr Miliband meanwhile backed the campaign. He said: ‘Feminism means a better world for us all and a battle yet to be won.’

Nick Clegg added: ‘I support equality and choice – so yes, I’m a feminist. How on earth in this day and age can you not be? As a wiser person than me once said: “Men who actually treat women as equals are the ones with more cojones.”’

When we asked the PM’s team why he wouldn’t wear the T-shirt for ELLE magazine’s inaugural feminism issue Mr Cameron said he’d rather give us a quote instead.

He said: ‘Whether you are a man or a woman, I passionately believe that everyone has a part to play in achieving full equality for women and girls.

‘As a parent I feel strongly that my daughters should have the same opportunities as my son. As a society we have come a long way in gender equality – but the journey hasn’t finished yet, which is why I am committed to doing everything I can do to remove barriers for women and achieve a fairer society.’

ELLE’s Editor-in-Chief Lorraine Candy said: 'We asked the Prime Minister five times if he would wear the Fawcett Society’s iconic This Is What A Feminist Looks Like slogan T-shirt and send us a snapshot (it would only take 10 minutes). Five times, he declined.

‘This is a shame on so many levels, especially given he knew Nick Clegg and Ed Miliband had agreed without hesitation, alongside many other influential men who were more than happy to call themselves feminists. It seems the Prime Minister still has an issue with the word “feminist”.’

Daisy Sands, of the women’s rights group the Fawcett Society, said: ‘We are very pleased the leaders of the UK’s three main political parties have publicly pledged their support for advancing equality between women and men, and have endorsed the ELLE x Whistles for Fawcett collaboration, which has relaunched Fawcett’s iconic This Is What A Feminist Looks Like T-shirt.

‘However, we understand making a personal commitment to the cause of feminism is a matter for the individual to decide. As it stands, it would appear that David Cameron is not comfortable with identifying himself with the cause of feminism, which, given the huge contribution the feminist movement has made to advancing women’s rights, is unfortunate.’

A report last year by Mumsnet and Ipsos Mori found the Conservatives lagging behind Labour among female voters. And in 2011 Mr Cameron was accused of having a ‘patronising and outdated attitude to women’ when he told Labour MP Angela Eagle to ‘calm down dear’ during a Commons debate.

Mumsnet chief executive Justine Roberts said: ‘It’s a shame David Cameron seems wary of calling himself a feminist when all it really means is advocating equal rights and opportunities for women.’
