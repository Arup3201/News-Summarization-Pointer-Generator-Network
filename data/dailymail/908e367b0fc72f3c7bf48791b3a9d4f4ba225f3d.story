Bobbi Kristina Brown has been involved in a car crash.

The 19-year-old daughter of Bobby Brown and the late Whitney Houston was not injured after wrecking her Chevrolet Camaro while driving in Alpharetta, Georgia on Wednesday.

Law enforcement sources tell TMZ a good Samaritan saw the vehicle totalled in an embankment and called 911.

According to the website, the teenager was standing next to her car when emergency personnel arrived.

Investigators
believe she lost control of the vehicle while making a left turn out of
her apartment complex, driving over a curb and hitting several small 
trees before stopping at a local park trail in the city, located about 26 miles north of Atlanta.

Bobbi Kristina was reportedly issued a traffic citation for 'failure to maintain lane'.

Police do not believe drugs or alcohol were a factor.

A
spokesman for Bobbi Kristina has not yet commented on the accident, 
which follows two months after she was involved in a car crash with 
then-boyfriend and 'adopted brother' Nick Gordon, and just a few weeks after she struck his repaired sports car in a parking lot at their home.

Bobbi Kristina was a passenger in Nick's black 2012 Camaro when it was severely damaged on September 26.

According to TMZ, the couple had been arguing at the time of the crash - which destroyed the entire front end of the vehicle. 

Nick's Camaro was the only car involved. No one was injured.

And earlier this month she accidentally 
struck Nick's car with her own vehicle in 
the parking garage of the apartment complex, causing severe damage to 
the front of his sports car.

Bobbi had followed Nick back to their apartment in her own Camaro and as
she tried to back into the parking space next to his, she struck his 
vehicle.

The couple have since called time on their romantic relationship, new reports suggest. 

The
pair announced their engagement last month in a preview for her family's upcoming
reality show Houstons: On Our Own, but the couple have now called off 
their relationship.

Nick, 22, tweeted on November 18: '@REALbkBrown and I are not engaged or dating. Just close like we have always been.'

Bobbi Kristina later wrote: 'Spending
time together, sunday night football & Playing with our @nickgordon
new 3DS's! Soooooo... Goodbye !!(:(:(: (sic)'.

The following week she also posted a number of cryptic tweets suggesting she is all alone.

She
wrote: 'I'm leaving , this this good ole town and driving to the send 
of the world . Maybe it's beautiful there (: Xxxo. Who do I trust in 
this world? Pfft well that's easy beezie, #Myself, No1 will kno's me 
like ME&They'd rather not take thtchance2knoME, &2me'.

'I
guess it's time 4me2stop depending on anymore. It's my time2follow what

(sic).'

At the time of the car crash, Bobbi Kristina described her self as 'Partner of @ndgordon' on her Twitter page.

Nick was informally adopted by Whitney when he was 12 and the pair were raised as brother and sister.

Cryptic: The 19-year-old appeared to write about 'driving to the end of the world'

They
were 'always close' growing up but their relationship changed as they 
got older and they sought comfort in each other after Whitney's death in
February and started living like a couple.

Whitney was found dead in a Beverly Hills hotel room on February 11, 2012.

The six-time Grammy Award-winning singer,  died at the age of 48 due to an accidental drowning complicated by heart disease and cocaine use.

Nick first fuelled rumours about a relationship with Bobbi Kristina in a tweet written in March, shortly after Whitney died.

He wrote: 'Yea we got a little closer and what!!!'

The controversial couple have reportedly been sharing her $1.2million Georgia home together ever since.

By the age of 30, Bobbi will have 
inherited everything that belonged to her mother - mansions, jewellery, 
cars, and an extraordinary fortune.

The aspiring actress was recently featured on Tyler Perry's sitcom For Better Or Worse.

She is now working on the family's reality series, which largely centres around Whitney's sister-in-law and former manager, Patricia Houston, as she and her relatives deal with the loss of the legendary singer.

Whitney’s brother Gary and Bobbi's grandmother Cissy Houston are also expected to feature in the Lifetime network show, which will detail Nick and Bobbi Kristina's apparent engagement and break-up.

One of the executive producers on the show replied to a tweet posted by Nick this month, writing: '@nickgordon @realbkbrown watch to see how it all unfolds on #TheHoustons on @lifetimetv (sic).'
