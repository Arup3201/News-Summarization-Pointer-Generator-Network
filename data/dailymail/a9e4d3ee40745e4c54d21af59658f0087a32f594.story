A teenage Michelle Obama look-alike got a surprising shout out from the first lady herself.

15-year-old Jada Campbell of Beachwood, Ohio is a big fan of Michelle Obama and has been told she looks and acts like her.

So Jada sent a few pictures of herself to Mrs Obama herself, asking what she thought. 

Resemblance: Jada Campbell sent three pictures of herself channeling the first lady's style, and was surprised to receive a message back from Mrs Obama

'I just sent her a picture. I had on a dress like she would wear and I said do I sort of have your style in this pic and she said yeah,' Jada told Action News 19.

But Jada was surprised when Mrs Obama responded to the pictures in a video recorded for People magazine.

'I was like wow, because I didn't know she was actually going to do a video and say my name. So that was a big shock,' Jada says.

In the video, Mrs Obama answers readers' questions while abroad in Africa, and Jada was one of the readers selected.

What a compliment: Mrs Obama responded to Jada's pictures, telling the teenager that she looked 'gorgeous' and that they were 'sisters' in power and leadership

'I saw your picture, you are gorgeous. 
And, to the extent that anyone compares you to me, I am flattered,' Mrs 
Obama said. 'As long as you are working as hard on the inside as you are
on the outside, then I take the compliment.'

Following in the first lady's footsteps: Jada attended the inauguration in January

Mrs Obama had a few more words of wisdom for the young girl.

'You and me, we're sisters in power, leadership - you and me, Jada. Change the world. I expect big things from you,' the first lady said.

It looks like Jada is already on the right track. She is part of a young scholars program at Warrensville High School, which means if she keeps her grades up she'll get a free ride to Ohio State University. Jada wants to to be a plastic surgeon.

'I'm absolutely proud of my daughter that Michelle Obama responded back to her. She has been great encouragement,' Jada's mother Wanda said.

Jada - who attended the inauguration in January - hopes to one day go back to Washington and meet Mrs Obama, the president and their daughters in person.
