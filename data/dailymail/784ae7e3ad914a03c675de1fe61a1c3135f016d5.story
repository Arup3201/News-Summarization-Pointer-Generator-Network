Tragic: Henry Tattersall was found hanged in his bedroom after racking up a large bill for Xbox games on his mother's credit card

A schoolboy of 13 hanged  himself after he racked up a £420 bill on his mother’s credit card by downloading games on to his Xbox, an inquest heard.

Henry Tattersall borrowed the card to buy computer games over four days, as a Christmas present to himself.

When the bank statement arrived in the post his mother Eve confronted him over the amount of money he had spent.

The teenager later went to his bedroom and did not respond when he was called down to dinner.

His 16-year-old sister Holly went up to get him and found her brother hanged in his room.

Despite efforts to resuscitate him he was later pronounced dead.

The youngster was found to have written on his Facebook page 15 minutes before he was discovered: ‘I’m going to kill myself.’

Henry was the second pupil from the same school to kill himself in just six months.

Classmate Declan Gatenby, 13, was found hanged in July last year after a row with his parents over their confiscation of his mobile phone.

The pair had both been at Fearns Community College, in Bacup, Lancashire, although Henry – who was diagnosed with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) – moved to Brambles East special school, in nearby Darwen, in September.

An inquest was told the credit card statement arrived in the post at the family home in Rossendale, on November 25 last year while Henry was at school.

Miss Tattersall, 35, told the hearing: ‘I personally believe that Henry was very shocked at the amount of money he had spent. He was upset that I was upset. He was upset that he had spent the money and we weren’t in a position to be able to afford that amount of money. He spent £422 over four days on it.’

Many parents have complained of unexpectedly high bills inadvertently incurred by their children's digital purchases.

Parents frequently link their credit cards to online accounts on mobile phones, tablets and games consoles, not knowing that children can then use the cards to buy games and add-ons for hundreds or even thousands of pounds.

In Henry Tattersall's case, his Xbox account was apparently linked to his mother's card, meaning he could download expensive games with no restrictions.

Another common mistake made by parents is to download an apparently free mobile app, not knowing that their children can make in-game purchases using a Google or Apple account.

A study released last year revealed that parents had lost £30million thanks to children's unauthorised purchases.

The Office of Fair Trading launched an investigation into the lack of protection for parents whose children accidentally rack up huge bills following a number of high-profile examples.

Eight-year-old Theo Rowland-Fry, from Bristol, spent nearly £1,000 on additional features for a Simpsons game which he was playing on the family iPad.

And Danny Kitchen, five, racked up a bill of £1,700 on a zombie game which was supposed to be free.

Costing anything between £4 and £50 each, online video games can be downloaded to an Xbox and played immediately.

Miss
 Tattersall said she could hear Henry talking out of his upstairs 
bedroom window to a friend at 4.20pm on the day he died, but that he did
 not respond when she called him down for his dinner at 5pm.

As well 
as Henry’s Facebook message there was a discussion on the social media 
site between some of his friends about Declan Gatenby’s grave.

Detective
 Inspector Jim Elston said there was no evidence from Henry’s phone that
 he had been bullied or had researched suicide methods prior to his 
death.

Coroner Richard Taylor recorded a verdict of misadventure, adding that he believed Henry ‘intended to be found’.

He
 said: ‘I am always suspicious and sceptical as to the intentions of 
children of such a young age as to whether or not they actually 
understand what’s going to happen to them. Leaving his door open? It 
strikes me that he had a very guilty conscience, but he clearly dwelt on
 this and was upset at what happened.

‘Maybe the conversation on 
Facebook about Declan Gatenby’s grave meant it was a spur-of-the-moment 
decision … I believe that he hoped to make a point and expected to be 
found. I don’t believe it was his intention to end his life.’

Miss Tattersall said: ‘Henry’s death was a complete waste.

‘The
 Henry I’m holding on to is the one running up the front steps, face 
beaming, with two bags of Christmas shopping and his pupil of the week 
award … [he] has left a massive hole in the family that cannot be 
filled.’
