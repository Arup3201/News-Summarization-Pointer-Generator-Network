A young girl was admitted to the hospital after she allegedly suffered horrific abuse at the hands of her mother.

Brittany Ruck, 25, of Conway, Pennsylvania, was so angry with her 6-year-old daughter's inability to count to 12 that she lifted the little girl out of a chair by her hair.

The child was pulled so hard that 'the girl’s scalp was separated from her skull and blood pooled around the girl’s eyes.'

Ruck reportedly admitted to pulling the young girl's hair on multiple occasions when questioned by authorities.

Doctors at Children's Hospital alerted police when the girl was brought in suffering from traction on August 31, a few days after the incident.

This is when the child revealed what happened, and said her mother had pulled her hair to throw her in a corner the day after she was pulled from the chair. 

'The little girl told us she could only count to 10 because she had 10 fingers, but she couldn’t count any higher. That’s when the mother grabbed her by her hair,' Conway police Officer Mike Priolo told WPXI. 

'It’s just sad because she didn’t do anything wrong and she had to bear the brunt of pain.'

Ruck, who says on Facebook she is a pharmacy technician at Millennium Pharmacy Systems, is facing charges including, aggravated assault and endangering the welfare of a child, and being held in the Beaver County Jail on $50,000 bond.

The married young mother has two other children, a son and a daughter, who are both younger than her 6-year-old. 

All three children have been placed with other family members at this time.
