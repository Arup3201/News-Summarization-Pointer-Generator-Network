A female doctor says she left her comfortable middle class life in Malaysia to join the Islamic State - where she married a jihadi she had never before met and whose language she could not speak.

Calling herself Shams, the 26-year-old has since kept an impassioned diary of the time she claims she spent in ISIS-held cities Taqba and Raqqa - updating a number of social media sites with florid descriptions of her marriage to a Morocco-born terrorist who uses the nom de guerre Abu Baraa.

As well as posting detailed accounts of her day to day life as an a terror bride, Shams also posts words of encouragement for other young female fanatics thinking of joining ISIS - often updating her websites with chilling images, including one of a doctor's stethoscope wrapped around a rifle.

Sick: This image Shams shared on social media is understood to show her and her ISIS jihadi husband Abu Baraa on their wedding day. Chillingly it is captioned: 'In the land of jihad...till martyrdom do us part'

Armed and dangerous: Shams - who uses the Twitter name Bird of Jannah - has told her followers that she first travelled to Syria in February, adding that felt 'excitement' at the prospect of joining the terrorist group

Chilling: In August Shams uploaded this sickening photograph of a doctor's stethoscope wrapped around a large assault rifle. She described it as a 'selfie' of her and her terrorist husband

Shams has told her followers that she first travelled to Syria in February, adding that her emotions were at the time were a mixture of 'excitement' at the prospect of joining the terrorists and 'sadness' at the thought of leaving family members at home in Malaysia.

She added that she can speak English, Urdu and Hindi, which has helped her fit in with the huge number of foreigners who have travelled to join ISIS without being able to speak Arabic.

Her claims cannot be independently verified and she has not responded to contact on social media.

Her marriage to Abu Baraa was arranged for her by another woman in April and, despite the couple not sharing a common language, Shams has written about their relationship in breathless phrases that wouldn't look out of place in a Mills and Boon novel.

Jihadi bride: Sham's marriage to Abu Baraa was arranged in April and, despite the couple not sharing a common language, she has written about their relationship in breathless phrases

Describing their first meeting, she wrote: 'I was trembling. Nervous. Scared. My emotions were mixed. When he noticed my arrival, he gave salaam [said hello] and introduced himself, so did I. Then, it was a long awkward silence.'

'After few minutes, I flipped my niqab. He looked at me, our eyes catches each others. He smiled. And asked a question I shall never forget . . . 'Can we get married today?',' she added.

Shams - who uses the Twitter handle @__birdofjannah - said the couple were married on the same day they met, but it took her a further 24 hours to 'fall in love'.

Describing their praying together, Shams said: 'He turned back and smiled at me. And I can feel something. Yes, I guess I just fell in love with someone - my husband! 

She went on to say that the couple have since downloaded dictionary apps on their iPhones in order to communicate with one another.

The majority of Sham's social media updates are syrupy phrases about her relationship with an ISIS fighter

However Shams is clearly aware of the potentially fleeting nature of a romance with a terrorist. 

On October 21 she wrote: I know for a fact that one day my husband will be a shaheed [martyr]... and I have to prepare for it.'

Not that such matters worry her. In one image she uploaded a photograph  understood to show her and a bearded, tie-wearing Abu Baraa on their wedding day. Chillingly the image was captioned: 'In the land of jihad...till martyrdom do us part'.

She later posted: 'I should learn to be positive and stay happy for the sake of my unborn baby.' 

In August, in a blog post claiming to tell 'the true story' of her life as a jihadi bride, Shams told her readers that she is taking some time off from her work as doctor  as she had been diagnosed with hyperemesis gravidarum.

The illness is the same form of acute morning sickness that the Duchess of Cambridge has suffered from during both her pregnancies.

Horror: Shams specialises in updating her social media sites with florid descriptions of her marriage to a Moroccan-born terrorist who uses the nom de guerre Abu Baraa

Warped: Shams says her parents are fully supportive of her decision to wage jihad. In fact she claims they have spent the past few months putting their affairs in order before they make the journey to join her in Syria

Shams claims that under the extreme interpretation of Islamic law practised in the areas of Syria and Iraq controlled by Iraq, she required her father's permission before being allowed to marry. 

Far from her family being horrified by her journeying to join the terror group, Shams said her parents are fully supportive of her decision to wage jihad. In fact she claims they have spent the past few months putting their affairs in order before they make the journey to join her in Syria.

When asked her reasons for joining ISIS by one of her many followers on social media, she said she first travelled to Syria in order to use her medical expertise to treat wounded jihadis.

Shortly after she uploaded a sickening photograph of a doctor's stethoscope wrapped around a large assault rifle, describing the image as a 'selfie' of her and her husband.

In one of her most recent postings on Twitter, Shams wrote: 'A life without jihad is like drinking sea water. It keeps you thirsty & cause you dehydrated [sic]. That's the condition of our Ummah [international Muslim community] today.'

The previous day she had posted: 'November is officially the month of martyrs, one after another, joining the smiling caravan.'
