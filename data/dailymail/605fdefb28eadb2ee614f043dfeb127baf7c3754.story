A solar panel manufacturer that received a half-billion dollar loan as part of President Barack Obama's stimulus package is laying off 1,100 workers and filing for bankruptcy.

Republicans are now looking into the 
government's loan to Fremont, California-based Solyndra LLC, saying it was clear that the company was a
 dubious investment.

It is likely that the bankruptcy will 
now serve as further ammunition for the President's opponents in 
Congress to criticise the economic stimulus bill.

Visited by the President last year as he outlined his economic stimulus package, Solyndra was the poster child for U.S. government investment in green technology.

But hard times have hit the U.S.'s solar industry and Solyndra is the third solar company to seek bankruptcy protection in the past month.

The price for solar panels has plummetted in part because of heavy competition from Chinese companies, dropping by about 42 percent this year.

The House Energy and Commerce Committee have already subpoenaed documents relating to the loan from the White House Office of Management and Budget.

'We've smelled a rat from the outset,' GOP Representatives Fred Upton of Michigan and Cliff Stearns of Florida said in a joint statement published yesterday.

Mr Upton and Mr Stearns said they would continue to seek documents that would provide more details about the Solyndra loan.

They added: 'Unfortunately, Solyndra is just the latest casualty of the Obama administration's failed stimulus, emblematic of an economic policy that has not worked and will not work.

'We hope this informs the president ahead of his address to Congress next week.'

When Obama, who is set to address Congress to unveil a new jobs plan, toured Solyndra's facilities last year he said the investment was important because more clean energy would benefit the environment, the economy and national security.

'The future is here,' Obama said during his visit. 'We're poised to transform the ways we power our homes and our cars and our businesses.

'And we are poised to generate countless new jobs, good-paying, middle-class jobs, right here in the United States of America.'

Energy Department spokesman Dan Leistikow said Solyndra was a once promising company that had increased sales revenue by 2,000 percent in the past three years.

The $535million loan guarantee was sought by both the Bush and Obama administrations, he said, and private investors also put more than $1billion into Solyndra.

'We have always recognized that not every one of the innovative companies supported by our loans and loan guarantees would succeed, but we can't stop investing in game-changing technologies that are key to America's leadership in the global economy,' Mr Leistikow said.

Solyndra had been heralded as one of the nation's bright spots of green technology innovation.

The company created an innovative solar 'tube' that could soak up sunlight from many different angles, producing energy more efficiently and using less space.

The company's panels were also light and easy to install, which was meant to save up front costs.

But over the past few years, other companies caught up and provided similar products at a lower cost.

Brian Harrison, Solyndra's president and CEO, said that raising capital had become impossible.

'This was an unexpected outcome and is most unfortunate,' Harrison said in a statement published yesterday.

Solyndra's Chapter 11 bankruptcy filing topped a disastrous month for the U.S. solar power industry.

Another solar company, Spectrawatt Inc. of Hopewell Junction, N.Y., filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy on Aug. 19.

Its CEO said in the filing that it could not compete with solar manufacturers in China, which receive 'considerable government and financial support.'

Spectrawatt's filing came four days after Evergreen Solar Inc. of Marlboro, Mass., filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy.

But solar industry advocates claimed the three companies' failures were not indicative of the health of the U.S. solar industry as a whole.

Rhone Resch, president and CEO of the Solar Energy Industries Association, said: 'In the last 18 months, solar companies have either added or expanded almost 60 factories in the U.S. and driven the installed cost of solar down by 30 percent.'

Mr Resch defended the Energy Department's loan guarantee programme, adding that it 'will help to deploy enough clean solar energy to power nearly 1 million homes and create tens of thousands of jobs across 28 states.'

Jesse Pichel, a clean energy analyst with New York-based investment firm Jefferies & Co. said Solyndra's products used unique technology that was more expensive to install, 'and the improvement was marginal at best.'
