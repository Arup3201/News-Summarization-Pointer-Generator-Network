Fascinating fire maps tracking the shifting patterns of wildfires across the world reveal a continuous pulse of flame around the globe.

The animation uses information from NASA satellites to show the annual shifts in the frequency and distribution of fires around the world over the past 12 years.

Flickering graphics highlight the locations of actively burning fires all over the globe on a monthly basis from 2000 up to 2012 - a year that has seen fires raging on Spain's Costa Del Sol, and is on track to become the worst on record for wildfires in the U.S.

Statistics: The moving map tracks the patterns of fires raging across the world

Reality: This photograph shows flames out of control near Coin in Malaga, southern Spain, in August. The country has been plagued by wildfires this summer due to unusually dry weather

The NASA maps - which incorporate blazes started by humans as well as wildfires - are based on observations from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) on NASA's Terra satellite.

The changing colours in the maps reflect the number of fires recorded within a 1,000-square-kilometre area, with white illustrating the highest amount - as many as 100 fires in one area per day - and red the lowest, as few as one fire per day.

Identifiable patterns that emerge in the maps over time can be attributed both to natural causes and to human involvement.

Natural cycles of rainfall, dryness and lightning strikes are behind many wildfires, while other blazes can be triggered by burning campfires or even a tossed cigarette.

Uncontrolled wildfires can burn acres of land - and consume everything in their path - in a matter of minutes.

Global pulse: Active fires are evident in Africa and other areas across the world in July 2011

Flickering: Pixels identify glowing flames in America, Africa and parts of Europe in the summer of 2010

Satellite technology: The animation was created using information gathered by NASA satellites in space

Shifting patterns: Wildfires can be triggered both by natural causes and human intervention

Havoc: Wildfires raging out of control can consume everything in their path

Flames: The maps track the shifting patterns in the distribution and frequency of wildfires over a 12 year period

Space agency: NASA collated information gathered from 2000 to 2012

Looking back: This map from July 2004 indicates less activity in Africa than in previous summers

Intense burning: The summer of 2003 again shows active fires in Africa and America, as well as smatterings in other areas

Past patterns: This map illustrates active fires around the globe a decade ago in summer 2002

High numbers: The areas of white indicate as many as 100 fires per day over a 1,000-square-kilometre area

Annual trends: The animation begins with data gathered in 2000

Fire swept through southern Spain this week as firefighters battled to bring a raging wildfire - suspected to have been caused by arsonists, under control. Thousands of holidaymakers were evacuated from hotels and villas on the Costa del Sol as the fire blazed.

The U.S. has also been stricken by massive blazes, with 2012 on course to become the worst year on record for wildfires across the country.

Leaping flames: Firefighters can be seen working to control a raging forest fire next to a road in Ojen, southern Spain, in August

Danger: Flames leap above a neighbourhood in the foothills of Colorado Springs in Colorado, U.S. in June 2012
