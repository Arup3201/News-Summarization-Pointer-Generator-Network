Mohamed Diame has credited the blistering start to his Hull career with a return to his favoured position.

Diame was a deadline day signing from West Ham, costing the Tigers £3.5million, and has already set about repaying manager Steve Bruce's faith.

The Senegalese scored a fine solo effort against his former club on debut and followed up with a fierce long-range strike in Saturday's 2-2 draw at Newcastle, success the 27-year-old puts down to a familiar central position.

'I am in a different position to West Ham,' he told the Hull Daily Mail.

'I was a winger there. I am now back in midfield where I have played all my life. West Ham is a great club and the fans were always behind me. But I am not a winger.

'I have goal targets, too, and playing as a winger meant I couldn't meet that target. I like Hull as a club. I can see myself doing well here.'

Diame also paid personal tribute to Bruce's man-management, adding: 'The manager is good for me. He gives me confidence and I want to pay that back. I like playing for people who believe in you.

'I have been happy with my performance. I have the confidence of the gaffer and am trying to give him everything back.

'Football is all about confidence and when you have people who believe in you then you play well.'
