Forget the elephant in the room... this hotel offers a llamas as standard with your stay.

At Llama’s Pyjamas in Penrith, Cumbria, guests not only get breakfast included with their room, they also get their very own curly-haired, big-toothed animal thrown in.

The unique overnight experience lets guests get up close and personal with 18 of the furry beasts, and they can even dine alongside them.

Owner Mary Walker's family-run 
business has only just been launched and promises guests a night to 
remember.

The family, who also run the Llama Karma Kafe where people can eat their lunch with llamas - as well as a llama trekking centre on the same site - came up with the idea after spotting a gap in the llama market.

Ms Walker said: 'Everyone who meets the llamas wants to take them home.'

'It’s very quirky and different because it looks South American and everything has been designed to fit in with the theme of llamas' home soil.'

Ms Walker added: 'For the past 20 years we have run a centre for llamas.

'We are very market-led and if enough people ask for something, we know it is something worth doing.'

The B&B, which has a number of double bedrooms, also has a large family suite for groups to share.

'The ground floor rooms have big glass French door window and we have taken down the dry stone wall outside so that the llamas can get right up to the house.

Ms Walker, 59, said: 'We have styled it in a Peruvian-Moroccan theme, and used mosaics and rich colours to make the place feel really authentic.

'One of the rooms is very bright and jewelled with glittery tiles and the other is very typical Peruvian with dark wood furniture.

Good company: Llamas are classed as 'the dolphins of the animal world', according to Miss Walker

'We have even gone as far as putting LED lights in the shower that glow purple colours to tell you how hot it is.

'At night the front of the B&B is totally lit up, giving it that extra edge.'

She added: 'It’s so unusual because of the way that it has been done, and you can see all of the animals from your window.'

Llamas are domesticated South American camelids, which when fully grown, can stand at heights of up to six foot.

They are very social animals and live with other llamas in a herd. Due to their intelligence they can learn simple tasks very quickly.

Llamas are well-socialised and trained to halter and lead after weaning and are very friendly and pleasant to be around. They are extremely curious and most will approach people easily.

'Llamas are classed as the dolphins of the animal world,' Miss Walker said.

'People expect them to be like horses but they are such gentle creatures.'

Intelligent: Llamas are 'very good at picking up your body language and only do it in response to your actions'

'They’re like no other animal you will have handled before, it’s likely being with a friend. They are so relaxing and put you at ease,' she said.

'They bond with you and cuddle and kiss you, but in the same way they aren’t in your face.

'They are very good at picking up your body language and only do it in response to your actions.

'People think they are watching the llamas but it’s the other way round, they are very inquisitive.

The Llama Karma Kafe and trekking centre is in the top 10 per cent for consistent reviews and has recently won the North West regional business award.

Miss walker said: 'People have a lot of fun and it’s very different. Surely a visit to a hotel where you have your very own llama has got to be an exciting experience!'

Rooms are available from £40 per person per night.
