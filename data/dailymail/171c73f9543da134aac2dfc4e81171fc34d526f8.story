This is the extraordinary 911 phone call made by Amanda Berry moments after fleeing the Cleveland dungeon she and two others had been held captive in for a decade.

Miss Berry, who disappeared in 2003 aged 14, is heard screaming down the phone to an Ohio police operator: 'I've been kidnapped and I've been missing for 10 years, and I'm, I'm here, I'm free now.'

The desperate call for help led to the discovery of Gina DeJesus and Michelle Knight, who were found alive on Monday inside a house in the west side of the city.

Ariel Castro, 52, has been arrested and is in police custody in connection with the kidnapping case along with his two unnamed brothers, who are 50 and 54.

SCROLL DOWN TO HEAR THE 911 CALL

Amanda Berry went missing ten years ago in 2003 just one day before her seventeenth birthday

The Cleveland Police Department has released the recording between Amanda Berry and a 911 operator just minutes after she was able
 to escape from the captor that had kept her imprisoned for ten years.

Berry sounds breathless but she manages to tell the dispatcher her name and of her decade-long plight, which included giving birth in the house.

'Hello it's me, help me I'm Amanda Berry,' she said.

After telling the operator that she's been in the news and missing for ten years she says, 'I'm here, I'm free now.'

She gives her address as 2207 Seymour.

Other cases: Gina DeJesus (left and right) went missing in 2004 on
 her way home from school, while other hostage Michelle Knight disappeared in 2002

When the dispatcher asks if she's actually at 2210 Seymour Amanda informs her that she is calling from across the street.

Berry was kidnapped over ten years ago in 2003 when she was fourteen and kept in a dungeon along with Gina DeJesus and Michelle Knight.

In the 911 call Berry implores the dispatcher that she needs the police immediately.

After the dispatcher says that she can talk to the police when they arrive Berry tells her, 'I need them now before he gets back.'

Berry gives the name of her captor: Ariel Castro. When the dispatcher asks what he's wearing Berry's voice rises to tell her 'I don't know he's not here now.'

In the recording the emotional cries from DeJesus and Knight can be heard.
