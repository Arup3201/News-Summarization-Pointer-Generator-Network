The makers of blockbuster movie Cloud Atlas have been criticised for using 'poorly-done' eye make-up to make white actors look Asian.

The use of 'eye prosthetics' to alter the appearance of the actors' eyes in the film, has been labelled 'disturbing' by an Asian American media watchdog.

Media Action Network for Asian Americans (MANAA) said the film's makers had also missed a 'great opportunity' to break racial stereotypes by using a white actor to play an Asian man in one of the lead 'action hero' roles.

Complaint: An Asian American media watchdog has called the use of heavily made-up white actors to play Asian characters in Cloud Atlas is 'disturbing'

Make-up: Jim Sturgess was one of the white actors made up to look Asian. Here he is shown playing character Hae-Joo Im in the film

Decision: Hugo Weaving (pictured) also played an Asian role in the film  which featured a series of racial transformations - including Halle Berry playing a white woman

'In the modern age of movie make up, it is disturbing to see poorly done Asian eye prosthetics to make Caucasian men look Asian,' Guk Aoki, MANAA's founding president told the Hollywood Reporter.

'Cloud Atlas missed a great opportunity.
 The Korea story’s protagonist is an Asian man--an action hero who 
defies the odds and holds off armies of attackers,' he told the website.

'It would 
have been a great, stereotype-busting role for an Asian American actor 
to play, as Asian American men aren’t allowed to be dynamic or heroic 
very often.'

IInstead it is white actor Jim Sturgess who plays that role in the film - which is thought to be one of the most expensive of its kind ever made and features an impressive all-star cast.

Tom Hanks, Halle Berry and Susan Sarandon were among the big names from the film who turned out for its premiere in Hollywood on Wednesday.

Fellow white actors Hugo Weaving and James D'Arcy also played Asian characters in Cloud Atlas, while black actor Keith David was made up to look Asian in the film too.

Mr Aoki complained about the apparent assumption that white actors could be made to look Asian just by changing their eyes and 'not their facial structure and complexion' - according to the Hollywood Reporter.

He was also critical of scenes in which Asian women were made to look white - which he accused the film's makers of taking greater trouble to get right - and said that in part of the film about black slaves, the slaves were played by black actors.

Other actors in the film to play different races included Ms Berry, who plays a white woman, and Mr Hanks who plays a British man of southern European heritage.

The purpose of these changes was intended by the film's makers to portray the 'continuity of souls,' according to the Reporter.

Mr Aoki said the film showed that using 'badly done yellowface' in films 'is still OK.'

The film’s directors Lana and Andy Wochowski attended the film's premiere. Following their success with the Matrix the sibling directors have teamed up again for the epic film, an adaptation of the novel of the same name.

The hotly anticipated movie hits cinemas on October 26.
