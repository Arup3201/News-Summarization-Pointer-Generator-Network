Two four-year-old boys enjoying a Mother's Day lunch were served alcoholic cocktails causing one child to be hospitalised for intoxication.

The boys were with their mother at Frenchy’s South Beach Café when she ordered them 'virgin' versions of a daiquiri last Sunday.

However, a waitress incorrectly entered the order at the Florida restaurant, according to police.

One of the children stopped drinking after tasting the cocktail - while the other drank more and became drunk. The boy was taken to hospital by ambulance and later released.

According to Clearwater police, the waitress Christine Johansen who brought the drinks to the table was extremely upset.

There was 'no intent involved on anyone’s part and it was an accidental incident' according to a report obtained by The Smoking Gun.  

Frenchy’s South Beach Café has been open since 1981 and has a large patio terrace and ocean views. 

Daiquiris are a strong, fruity drink which usually have a rum, lime juice and sugar base.
