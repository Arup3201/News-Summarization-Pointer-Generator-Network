NO MORE CLIMBING

It is likely that never again shall we see the Wimbledon champion climbing onto the roof of the commentary box as they go to celebrate with their coaches and family after the All England Club installed a new gate this year at the front of the Centre Court players’ box. It allows players to walk directly from the court to the box through the stands.

Still GB, for now...

On the day which Great Britain find out their 2015 Davis Cup opponents in the first round draw in Dubai, the Scottish independence referendum takes place on September 18.

If Scotland vote yes, though, it would be at least another three years before they could field their own team due to the long and complicated application process.

TAKE YOU PICK, MARIA

Maria Sharapova received a surprise proposal as she watched Russia take on Algeria in the World Cup from her rented house in Wimbledon on Thursday night.

Four Russian fans were spotted by TV cameras holding up banners which read: ‘Sharapova Will You Marry Me?’ The 2004 Wimbledon champion responded on Twitter: ‘I missed the goal but I didn’t miss this… I have to marry all 4?’

SERVICE PAIN

Monica Niculescu was in tears as she took a blow to the back of her head — courtesy of a serve from doubles partner Klara Koukalova. The Romanian was at the net when Koukalova’s serve went flying into her. The pair went on to lose to Garbine Muguruza and Carla Suarez Navarro.

PATTY'S PREGNANT

Former world No 7 Patty Schnyder, 35, announced her pregnancy yesterday on Facebook. She wrote: ‘I’m pregnant. And there is a daddy full of joy too. So there was no sperm donator needed.’

Schnyder last year split with husband Rainer Hoffman, a private detective originally hired by her parents to rescue her from a former lover and coach.

ARE YOU SURE, LESIA?

The award for worst challenge of the tournament goes to Ukrainian Lesia Tsurenko who asked to review one of Simona Halep’s serves.

Hawk-eye showed the ball to be at least two feet clear of both lines inside the service box. It brought back memories of Marat Safin’s challenge during his 2008 semi-final defeat here to Roger Federer which became a YouTube classic.

DYLAN BOWS OUT

After nine years of service, police bade farewell to sniffer dog Dylan who scoured the grounds here for the last time yesterday.

Dylan has worked in security all his life, ensuring there are no explosives on site. The Labrador has also done his bit for the next generation, fathering 29 children, a number of whom have followed in his footsteps.
