On his way: Former Newcastle striker Nile Ranger has agreed terms with Blackpool

Ranger, whose career has been blighted by a string of off-field controversies, left Swindon Town in May after his contract was mutually terminated.

The 23-year-old former England youth international scored eight goals in 22 games for Swindon.

He has also had spells on loan at Barnsley and Sheffield Wednesday while on Newcastle’s books.
