A huge spillage of mash potato brought a major road to a standstill as emergency services desperately tried to clear up the unusual incident.

Motorists were urged to avoid the A64 near Malton, North Yorkshire, after it was left covered in food when a lorry accidentally shed its load.

The lorry dropped just over a quarter of its contents on the carriageway at about 3.30pm yesterday, which resulted in thousands of drivers being stuck in huge traffic jams.

Police were forced to close the road after the lorry shed its load of instant mash potato on the A64 in North Yorkshire. Officers said the lorry shed about a quarter of its load in the incident which caused huge tailbacks

The lorry was travelling westbound towards York, before the road becomes a duel carriageway, when the incident happened.

One witness, who wished not to be named, said: ‘It was like a sea of white.

‘I was about a mile away from where it happened but I could still see it.

‘At first I just didn't know what it was. I heard it was mash potato, but I am not sure whether it was mashed before or after the spillage.

‘It was a big disturbance for the area, and I think the only diversion for drivers would be down country lanes.

‘The road was closed for hours and hours.’

North Yorkshire Police said the road was closed after the incident created unsafe driving conditions.

A spokesman said: ‘Instant mash is covering the road and cars have skidded as a result of the mash swelling up.’

Highways Agency crews and firefighters also attended the scene and the road was closed in both directions for several hours while the carriageway was cleared.

Nobody was injured in the incident and the road was later re-opened on Saturday evening.

It is the second time this month that a lorryload of mashed potato has led to traffic chaos.

Twenty firefighters along with police and an ambulance were called to Henley Bridge in Henley-on-Thames following a report that a lorry had crashed and spilled its load.

Initially, it was feared there had been a toxic chemical spill, but it later turned out to be mashed potato that was due to be used in animal feed.

The road was closed for three hours while rescue workers scraped the potato from the road and hosed it down.

Room for seconds: Earlier this month a lorry carrying mashed potato intended for animal feed spilled its load in Henley-on-Thames, Oxfordshire
