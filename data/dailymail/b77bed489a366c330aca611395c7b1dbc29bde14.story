It seems that Champagne isn’t the only Christmas fizz being quaffed this year, as sales of specialty British beers have soared by up to 500 per cent.

Premium beers, ales and lagers have become the festive tipple of choice, as shoppers pick up individual bottles to enjoy at home.

Sales of London-based beer Fullers ESB are up 120 per cent year on year, and Meantime IPA is up 500 per cent year on year.

Flavoured 
beers are also proving popular, as Innis Gunn Rum Cask beer is up 22 per
cent.

And Meantime Chocolate Porter, a rich dark beer made with real 
chocolate, is up 400 per cent.

David
Wyllyams, Waitrose beer buyer, said: 'Shoppers aren’t celebrating the 
festive season with just wine and spirits any more - it’s all about beer
this Christmas.

'There are so many varieties and 
flavours, all made in Britain, that everyone is bound to find a beer 
they’ll enjoy cracking open on Christmas day.’

The
trend for artisan beers is becoming increasingly popular, and small 
breweries are experimenting with styles and flavours to create fun and 
interesting drinks for a more personal drinking experience at home.

It’s
not just the British booze that is causing a flurry - American craft 
beers are enjoying a sales uplift of 20 per cent year on year.
