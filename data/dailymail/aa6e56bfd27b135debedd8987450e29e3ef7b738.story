Whether you suffer hangovers is, in part, determined by your genes, a team of scientists has discovered

Whether or not you will fall victim to a monumental hangover after a night out drinking is, in part, determined by your genes, scientists have revealed.

While the speed at which a person drinks, whether they eat before embarking on a drinking session and their tolerance for alcohol plays a part, a team of researchers believe a person's DNA will account for almost half of the reason as to why they are afflicted the morning after.

The study examined links between the number of hangovers each individual reported experiencing in a year, and their genetic make-up, Live Science reported.

The team studied more than 4,000 adults from the Australian Twin Registry to reach their conclusions.

Their findings found genetic factors accounted for 45 per cent of the difference in hangover frequency in women and 40 per cent in men.

Furthermore, the scientists discovered that those people who had the genetic variants involved in increasing the risk of suffering a hangover, also drank to excess more regularly than those lacking the hangover genes.

They concluded that those genes, which dictate how often a person is struck by a hangover, may also control how frequently they get drunk.

As a result, it is hoped the findings could help contribute to future research on alcohol addiction, researchers say.

Study leader, Wendy Slutske, a psychology professor at the University of Missouri-Columbia, said: 'We have demonstrated that susceptibility to hangovers has a genetic underpinning.

'This may be another clue to the genetics of alcoholism.'

She said those who are less susceptible to a hangover, might be more prone alcohol addiction.

The participants of the study revealed how many times they had got drunk in the last year, along with how frequent their hangovers were - telling researchers the number of days in the previous year they felt sick the day after drinking.

And the twins taking part reported their 'hangover resistance' - whether or not they had ever experienced a hangover after getting drunk.

Scientists found a strong link between identical twins in reports of hangover frequency and resistance, suggesting there are genetic similarities that play a part in determining if a person will fall victim to a hangover.

'With drinking alcohol, it is not "one size fits all",' Professor Slutske said.

'People are different in their ability to consume alcohol without experiencing adverse consequences, such as having a hangover.'

Professor Slutske's team did note their study was limited because people's memories of their drinking habits, may not have been totally accurate.
