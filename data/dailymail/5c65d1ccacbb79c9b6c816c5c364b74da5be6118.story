With global sea levels rising and 
flooding becoming more common in many parts of the world, architects are now looking at new ways to construct buildings, such as the Makoko Floating School.

The ambitious project is currently under construction in the 
water community of Makoko in Nigeria.

The floating school will not be a totally alien sight to residents - people living in the fishing community of Lagos have built their homes on the water and have traded on it for years.

But the area has only one primary school so the new floating construction is a welcome addition for locals.

Future: With global sea levels rising and flooding becoming more common in many parts of the world, architects are now looking at new ways to construct buildings, such as the Makoko Floating School

Novel: The Makoko Floating School is an ambitious project that is currently under construction in the water community of Makoko in Lagos, Nigeria

The triangular building is being put together by NLÉ, a collaborative agency whose 
mission is to provide architectural change for developing cities.

The 
three-story architectural structure, built as a triangular prism, is 
intended to float on water with a base made of 256 plastic drums.

Built with locally sourced wood and electrically 
powered with solar panels, the 
floating construct is designed to house about 100 students and even has a playground and green space.

Empowering: Architect Kunlé Adeyemi of NLÉ said that using floating devices meant they were not relying on the total strength of the soil which is normally an issue for builders in the local area

Solution: The idea of building on stilts and raising houses is a traditional approach used in many low-lying areas where flooding is frequently a problem

Nigerian-born, Netherlands-based architect, Kunlé Adeyemi of NLÉ told World Architecture News that
the use of floating devices meant they were not relying on the total 
strength of the soil, as the soil around Makoko is particularly loose.

He spoke of the adaptability of the 
design, as the water level changes frequently in the area so they 
'wanted a design that would adapt to the changing conditions.'

Mr Adeyemi hopes his design will pioneer sustainable development in coastal African cities and his floating town design will eventually replace the entire Makoko shanties.

According to the progress report issued by the architects, the school will be completed by the end of the month, with the floating houses being finished in September of this year and the Lagos Water Community project by the end of 2014.

Labour of love: Built with locally sourced wood and electrically powered with solar panels, the floating construct is designed to house about 100 students and even has a playground and green space

Innovative: The three-story architectural structure, built as a triangular prism, is intended to float on water with a base made of 256 plastic drums

Ambitious: The pilot project will generate a viable, ecological and alternative building system and urban culture for the teeming population of Africa's costal regions

Way of life: The floating school will not be a totally alien sight to residents - people living in the fishing community of Lagos have built their homes on the water and have traded on it for years

Ambitons: Mr Adeyemi hopes his design will pioneer sustainable development in coastal African cities

Versatile: Mr Adeyemi spoke of the adaptability of the design, as the water level changes frequently in the area so they 'wanted a design that would adapt to the changing conditions'

Playtime: Children dance on on a floating platform in the middle of their neighbourhood
