Millions of pounds in penalty fines will be levied on failing Network Rail as an 'incentive' to make trains run on time, the Government’s official rail watchdog announced today.

The aim is to improve punctuality for the nation’s beleaguered rail users faced with late and cancelled trains and soaring fares.

In future, Network Rail will be hit with a £15million fine for every percentage point it falls below its agreed punctuality target for long-distance services.

Painful reading: The Government's rail watchdog will be hitting Network Rail with fines for 'unacceptably' late or cancelled trains in a bid to improve punctuality

From next year, 92 per cent of trains must run on time.

Currently the figure is 89.2 per cent, equivalent to more than one in 10 trains running behind schedule.

If Network Rail fails to improve on that figure, it faces a £42million fine.

Last year, the journeys of 13.7million passengers travelling on long-distance trains were affected by late or cancelled services – a scandal the Office of Rail Regulation (ORR) found 'unacceptable'.

Network Rail’s punctuality performance failures mean it is currently on track to breach the terms of its licence to operate, according to the watchdog.

The rail watchdog announced its punitive action today because of increasing dissatisfaction with poor time-keeping on the nations railways.

Network Rail may even face a separate one-off fine for poor performance this year.

A spokesman for the ORR said: ‘We have told Network Rail to deliver better levels of punctuality for passengers on long-distance train services or face a substantial penalty.

'The aim is to give Network Rail an incentive to improve. We don’t want to fine them. We want the trains to run on time. They are responsible for that  performance.'

The regulator has instructed Network Rail to deliver plans, agreed with train operators, for better levels of punctuality on long-distance services in 2012-13. It must also speed-up further improvements towards meeting its committed punctuality target of 92 per cent in 2013-14.

The ORR said: 'If the company fails to deliver the 2013-14 target it will face a substantial financial penalty.

'The size of any financial penalty will reflect the extent of Network Rail’s failure to meet the commitment, increasing by £1.5 million per 0.1 percentage point it drops below the 92% punctuality target.'

However, the regulator said passengers are experiencing good levels of punctuality 'by historical standards'.

But it stressed: ‘Network Rail committed to achieving more, and taxpayers and customers have paid the company to deliver.

'Our investigation showed that the company struggled to cope with the challenges of reaching its long distance punctuality target.'

An increase in cable theft has caused many cancellations, but the watchdog stressed that many of the problems - including timetable planning and predicting and spotting equipment failures - are 'of the company’s own making'.

ORR chief executive Richard Price, said: 'Levels of punctuality on long distance rail services across Britain are good by historical standards, but passengers should be experiencing even better levels of train performance, benefitting from the punctuality commitments which they and taxpayers have funded Network Rail to deliver.'

Network Rail’s funding for the next five year period (2014-2019) will be in part dependent on any ‘failure to deliver’ on performance now.

The watchdog said: 'We concluded that Network Rail is likely to be in breach of its licence with regards to performance in the long-distance sector in 2013-14.'

'Unacceptable': Last year, the journeys of 13.7million passengers travelling on long-distance trains were affected by late or cancelled services

It has proposed, subject to statutory consultation, to make an enforcement order requiring Network Rail to meet its performance target of 92 per cent, adding: 'Furthermore, we will be carefully monitoring progress of the agreed plans for 2012-13 and will take further action if they are not being delivered.'

In January 2012, the regulator issued an enforcement order requiring Network Rail to develop new, robust plans to help recover long distance performance.

The measure for punctuality  for long distance trains allows them to arrive at their final destination within ten minutes of the advertised time.

Network Rail committed to, and was funded to achieve, 92 per cent of trains arriving within that wnidow in 2012-13.

Network Rail’s current long-distance punctuality is 89.2per cent – which would leave it with £42million fine.

It has plans in place to take it to 90.4per cent, which is still below its target and would incur a £24 million fine.

Backing: Rail Performance Minister Norman Baker has commended the watchdog's robust approach

Network Rail chief executive Sir David Higgins said: ‘We welcome the ORR's recognition that we, and the train operating companies, have already done much to improve long-distance punctuality in this control period - which is currently running at a record level of 89.2 per cent for the past year - and we accept the challenge to deliver an even better service.

'We are determined to do all we can to achieve that through balancing the continued growth in demand with passengers' desire for improved reliability in terms of punctuality.'

ORR chief executive Mr Price said in future train companies will also be required to publish exact 'right time' figures showing ‘to the minute’ on every journey how late trains really are – not just broad averages or whether trains arrive within the generous ten minute punctuality window they currently enjoy.

Anthony Smith, chief executive of rail customer watchdog Passenger Focus, said: 'We know from our research that getting trains on time is both the key driver of passenger satisfaction and a key priority for improvement.

'Performance has not been good enough and it is good to see action being taken so that passengers can get back to depending on the railway to deliver them on time.'

Rail Performance Minister Norman Baker said: 'I hope the ORR's robust approach will encourage NR in driving up performance and improving reliability for passengers.'

Michael Roberts, Chief Executive of the Association of Train Operating Companies (ATOC) representing the train firms who use the tracks run by Network rail said: 'The regulator is right to take a firm line with Network Rail. The big problem for long distance rail passengers is lack of consistency in train service punctuality and Network Rail needs to do a better job of managing the track and signals to resolve this.'
