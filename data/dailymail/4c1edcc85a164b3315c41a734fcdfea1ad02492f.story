Real Madrid defender Pepe has never been predictable - but it's not an unprovoked act of violence or his latest red card that has caused a shock this time.

In a truly hair-raising act of individuality, the Portugal international has decided on a new haircut that comes straight from the rap artist Coolio school of style.

The 31-year-old - who previously had skinhead before the curls he sported at the World Cup - has had his hair coiffed into stand-up dreads that would give even Bacary Sagna a run for the worst haircut in football.

The Brazilian-born centre back has returned to Los Blancos for pre-season training after a disappointing World Cup where he was sent off in Portugal's opening game for a typically aggressive reaction following a foul on Germany's Thomas Muller.

Portugal lost that game 4-0 and Cristiano Ronaldo and Co were eventually eliminated at the group stage, losing out to Germany and the USA.

And, dodgy haircuts aside, this wasn't the first time that Pepe has lost his head. The was banned for 10 matches after attacking Getafe's Javi Casquero and Juan Albin towards the end of a Spanish league game in 2009.
