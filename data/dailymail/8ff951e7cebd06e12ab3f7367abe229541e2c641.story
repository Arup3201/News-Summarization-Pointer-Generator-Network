Microsoft is working on an
advanced version of its competitor to Apple's Siri, using
research from an artificial intelligence project called
'Einstein.'

Microsoft has been running its 'personal assistant'
Cortana on its Windows phones for a year, and will put the new
version on the desktop with the arrival of Windows 10 this
autumn. 

It has now been revealed Cortana will be available as a standalone app,
usable on phones and tablets powered by Apple Inc's iOS
and Google Inc's Android, people familiar with the
project said.

Cortana could tell a mobile phone user when to leave for the airport, days after it read an email and realized the user was planning a flight. 

It would automatically check flight status,determine where the phone is located using GPS, and checking traffic conditions. 

Microsoft has been running its 'personal assistant 'Cortana on its Windows phones for a year, and will put the new version on the desktop with the arrival of Windows 10 this autumn. 

'This kind of technology, which can read and understand
email, will play a central role in the next roll out of Cortana,
which we are working on now for the fall time frame,' said Eric
Horvitz, managing director of Microsoft Research and a part of
the Einstein project, in an interview at the company's Redmond,
Washington, headquarters.

The plan to put Cortana on machines running software from
rivals such as Apple and Google, as well as the Einstein
project, have not been reported. 

Cortana is the name of an
artificial intelligence character in the video game series
'Halo.'

They represent a new front in CEO Satya Nadella's battle to
sell Microsoft software on any device or platform, rather than
trying to force customers to use Windows. 

Success on rivals'
platforms could create new markets and greater relevance for the
company best known for its decades-old operating system.

The concept of 'artificial intelligence' is broad, and
mobile phones and computers already show dexterity with spoken
language and sifting through emails for data, for instance.

Still, Microsoft believes its work on speech recognition,
search and machine learning will let it transform its digital
assistant into the first intelligent 'agent' which anticipates
users needs. By comparison, Siri is advertised mostly as
responding to requests. 

Google's mobile app, which doesn't have
a name like Siri or Cortana, already offers some limited
predictive information 'cards' based on what it thinks the user
wants to know.

Microsoft has tried to create digital assistants before,
without success. Microsoft Bob, released in 1995, was supposed
to make using a computer easy, but ended up being the butt of
jokes. 

The Office Assistant nicknamed 'Clippy' suffered a
similar fate a few years later.

'We're defining the competitive landscape... of who can
provide the most supportive services that make life easier, keep
track of things, that complement human memory in a way that
helps us get things done,' said Horvitz.

Outside his door stands 'The Assistant', a monitor showing a
woman's face that can converse with visitors, has access to
Horvitz's calendar and can book meetings.

On his desktop, Horvitz runs 'Lifebrowser', a program that
stores everything from appointments to photos and uses machine
learning to identify the important moments. 

A keyword search for
his university professor instantly brings up photos and video
from the last time they met.

Cortana could tell a mobile phone user when to leave for the
airport, days after it read an email and realized the user was
planning a flight. It would automatically check flight status,
determine where the phone is located using GPS, and checking
traffic conditions.

None of the individual steps are a breakthrough, but
creating an artificial intelligence that can stitch together the
processes marks a breakthrough in usefulness, Microsoft says.

Apple is also pushing Siri, which uses Microsoft's Bingsearch engine in the background, into new areas with its CarPlayand HomeKit platforms, as well as the recently unveiled AppleWatch.

Rivals are on the same track. Google's latest mobile app
uses the predictive power generated from billions of searches to
work out what a user is doing, what they are interested in, and
sending relevant information, such as when a favorite sports
team is playing next.

The key to Cortana's success will be knowing where a user
is, what time it is, and what they are trying to do. Albert
Einstein's work on the relationship between space and time gave
rise to Microsoft's secret project name, said Horvitz.

'Einstein was brilliant about space and time,' he said.
'It's using brilliance about space and time generally in our
agents.'
