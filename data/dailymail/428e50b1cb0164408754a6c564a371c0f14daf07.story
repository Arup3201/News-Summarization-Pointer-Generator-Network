They were among a group of 19 artists, activists and lawmakers receiving the award - the highest possible civilian honor - at the ceremony Monday.

In a lengthy speech he lavished attention on his favorite talents - recounting his personal love for Streep's films, and how he bought his first Stevie Wonder album aged 10 - and still listens to him on the campaign trail.

He said: 'I have said publicly, I love Meryl Streep. I love her. Her husband knows I love her, Michelle knows I love her. There's nothing nothing either of them can do about it.

'She inhabits her characters so fully and compassionately, saying it is the greatest gift of human beings that we have this power of empathy.

'And off the screen as an advocate for women and girls, she uses that gift to help others write the stories of their choosing and to encourage greater empathy in the rest of us.

'She is truly one of America's leading ladies.'

Of Wonder, he said: 'Early copies of Stevie wonder's classic album - Talking Book - had a simple message written in braille: "Here is my music, it is all I have to tell you how I feel, know that your love keeps my love strong."'

'This is by the way the first album I ever bought with my own money. I was ten years old, maybe 11.' 

He continued: 'A musical prodigy with an electrifying voice, Stevie's blend of R&B and jazz and funk and blues and soul and whatever else you got speaks of love and loss, justice and equality, war and peace.

'But what really defines Stevie's music is the warmth and humanity that resonates in every note. Some of the songs helped us to fall in love on the others mended our hearts - and motivated some of us on the campaign trail.

In a reference to one of Wonder's biggest hits, he finished by saying: 'And thanks to Stevie all of us have been moved to Higher Ground.'

Others receiving the award included Ethel Kennedy, author Isabel Allende and Rep. John Dingell, D-Mich., the longest-serving member of Congress who is retiring at the end of the year.

He said: 'At pivotal moments, Tom got it. He reported on Watergate, snuck a camera into Tienanmen Square. He sat down for the first one-on-one with Mikhail Gorbachev with an american American TV reporter, covered every presidential election since 1968.

'We have welcomed him into her home at dinnertime and Sunday mornings. We trusted him to tell us what we needed to know and to ask questions that needed asking.

'I know because i have been on the receiving end of some of those questions.'

Posthumous medals went to six individuals, among them civil rights workers James Chaney, Andrew Goodman and Michael Schwerner, who were slain in 1964 as they participated in a historic voter registration drive in Mississippi.

Composer Stephen Sondheim was scheduled to receive the award, but Obama said he couldn't make it and will be included in next year's class of honorees.
