The U.S. women's soccer team has advanced to the gold medal match of the Olympic tournament with a wild 4-3 win in extra time over Canada.

Alex Morgan scored on a header in the final minute of injury time in extra time Monday night for the two-time defending Olympic champions, who will play Japan on Thursday for the title.

Christine Sinclair scored a hat trick for the Canadians. Megan Rapinoe scored twice, and Abby Wambach had one goal for the U.S.

'Even when they scored their third goal, there was something in me that knew that we had more, that we could give more,' Wambach said.

'I don't know what that means, quite honestly. I don't know if it's just confidence until the end, but this team has a belief in itself, even when the going gets rough.'

The final at Wembley Stadium will be a rematch of last year's World Cup final, which was won by Japan on penalty kicks.

The Americans have played in the gold medal match in every Summer Games since women's soccer was introduced in Atlanta in 1996.

Canada will play France for the bronze medal.

Earlier, the coach of the Canadian women’s soccer team stoked tensions with the U.S. squad just before their semifinal match today, taking a jab at the Americans for what he calls 'highly illegal' tactics.

John Herdman accused Team USA of breaking the rules with their physical play on set pieces.

Herdman
said yesterday: 'One of the big threats we've got to take care of, and 
what we've paid attention to, is the illegal marking in the box on their
corners and free kicks.'

'Some of the blocking tactics, which are highly illegal, we'll keep an eye on them in the game. We've starting working on that in training without trying to injure our players.'

'Obviously they're trying to free up a key player, but in a very illegal way... The U.S., it's what they do well,' he said.

Herdman cited an example from the Americans' victory over France in the Olympic opener, when forward Abby Wambach headed in a corner kick in the first half.

Few successes: Canada is winless in its last 27 matches against its rivals to the south, going 0-23-4 since a win at the Algarve Cup in 2001

He said U.S. defender Amy LePeilbet 'took a good battering' while making a move that freed up Wambach.

Canada is winless in its last 27 matches against its rivals to the south, going 0-23-4 since a win at the Algarve Cup in 2001. 

The all-time series tilts 44-3-5 in favour of the Americans.

Nonetheless, the U.S. did not be taking its previous successes for granted.

Wambach added: 'Canada has always been a dogfight for some reason.

'We've had historically close matches 
and because of the physical nature of the play, the result has often 
been a lot closer than we would have liked.'

It's wasn't the first time the U.S. has been accused of playing dirty during the London games.

Colombian soccer player Lady Andrade, who was suspended last month after 'sucker punching' Wambach, said that it was the Americans who struck first.

'The whistle always goes in their favour,' she insisted. 'They were hitting us and hitting us, but there was never a whistle.'
