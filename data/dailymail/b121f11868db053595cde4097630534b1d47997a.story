The grandmother who helped organize a staged kidnapping of her 6-year-old grandson to teach him a lesson about stranger danger appeared in court on Tuesday as she was charged for the traumatic four-hour experience. 

Rose Brewer is sharing the same lawyer as the man who lured her unnamed grandson after school one day, 23-year-old Nathan Firoved, and both entered not guilty pleas. 

The boy's mother, 25-year-old Elizabeth Hupp, and aunt, 38-year-old Denise Kroutil, will enter their pleas at their next February 26 court date, according to St Louis Today.

The boy's mother, grandmother, aunt and her co-worker Firoved are accused of terrorizing a 6-year-old boy in an attempt to toughen him up because he was too nice to strangers. 

The incident took place last week in Troy, Missouri, where Lincoln County sheriff’s deputies say the child was lured into a pickup truck by Firoved while he was walking home from school.

Once inside the truck, Firoved told him he would never ‘see his mommy again’, and he would be ‘nailed to the wall of a shed’ Fox 2 reported.

The crying child was then shown a gun and threats were made to hurt him if he did not stop crying.

The boy’s hands and feet were then bound with plastic bags and he was blindfolded with a jacket.

Firoved drove the boy around for a while to disorient him and then took the terrified child unknowingly to his home.

The ordeal did not end there.

His aunt then removed the boy’s pants, told him he could be sold into sex slavery and shouted at him for not resisting either her or Firoved.

He was then left in the basement for some time before being untied.

Family members then lectured him about stranger danger. The whole ordeal went on for four hours.

The boy told school officials about the incident soon afterwards, and they called the local division of Family Services. 

Firoved works with Kroutil and told deputies that he was asked to kidnap the boy to ‘scare’ him because he was ‘too nice’ to people.

The suspects have told investigators that they were trying to teach the boy a lesson. They were reportedly unrepentant and felt they did nothing wrong.

All four suspects are being held at Lincoln County Jail on $250,000 cash only bonds and are facing charges including felony kidnapping and abuse and neglect of a child.

The boy has been placed into protective custody.
