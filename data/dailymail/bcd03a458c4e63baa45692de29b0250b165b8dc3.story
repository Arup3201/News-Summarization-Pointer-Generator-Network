Tens of thousands of middle-aged adults are developing dementia, a report will warn this week.

More than 42,000 Britons under the age of 65 are thought to have the illness - twice as many as was previously thought. This includes 2,000 who are in their forties.

Charities warn that many adults are coming to terms with the condition whilst still working, looking after children and paying off their mortgage.

They are also concerned that doctors are misdiagnosing many younger sufferers as they assume dementia mainly occurs in the elderly.

Fears: A new study has found that 42,000 people in the UK are suffering from early-onset dementia

But a report by the Alzheimer’s Society to be published on Wednesday will warn that twice as many adults are developing dementia in mid-life than previously thought.

There are now 42,325 cases of early onset dementia in UK – which occurs before the age of 65 – previously there were only thought to be 17,000 cases.

This includes 2,010 in their 40s, 7,700 cases in their 50s, 32,000 in their 60s and 707 cases in their 30s.

Men are slightly more at risk than women – they account for 21,519 cases compared to 20,806.

And overall, the under 65s are believed to account for a third of all cases of dementia.

Jeremy Hughes, chief executive at Alzheimer’s Society said: ‘For too long dementia has been perceived as a natural part of ageing which only affects the oldest of the old in our society.

‘Say the word Alzheimer’s and many people picture a frail, elderly person in a care home.

‘The risk of developing dementia does increase with age, but the reality is that dementia is caused by diseases of the brain that don’t discriminate.

Worrying: The report will also warn that the numbers of Britons with early-onset dementia will rise by a fifth by 2051. File picture

‘Many people will be coming to terms with the symptoms while still in work, perhaps looking after children and paying a mortgage.

‘Too often we hear of people reporting memory loss to their doctor in mid-life, but being misdiagnosed because they are considered too young to have dementia.’

The report will also warn that the numbers of Britons with early-onset dementia will rise by a fifth by 2051 to 50,000 cases.

Many of those who develop the illness at a younger age have a family history although it is also triggered by alcohol and linked to Down’s Syndrome.

The most recent figures show that 850,000 Britons have dementia although the report this week will warn the numbers are significantly higher.

Ministers are becoming increasingly concerned at the burden the illness is placing on the health service.

And despite decades of research, drug companies have failed to find a cure or even a treatment to halt the illness’s progression.

Last year David Cameron promised to double the funding for dementia research in the hope of that there will be a major breakthrough by 2025.

Recently there have been a number of setbacks and several drugs which initially seemed promising were later found to be ineffective.

Researchers are now focusing their efforts on developing treatments to give to patients very early on possibly before symptoms develop.

The few existing drugs only work in people who are diagnosed very early on and they only temporarily halt the disease’s progression.

Symptoms include memory problems, confusion, hallucinations and problems with language, speech and moving around.

On average patients live for between eight and ten years after symptoms first occur but it varies hugely between individuals.
