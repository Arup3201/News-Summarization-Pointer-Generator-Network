Cilla Black, 71, who has joined the euthanasia debate admitting that she doesn't want to live too long

Veteran TV star Cilla Black joined the euthanasia debate last night, admitting she still thinks 75 is ‘a good age to go’.

‘I still think that way,’ the 71-year-old Blind Date presenter told the Daily Mirror.

‘If things are starting to drop off – like the hearing – and I’ve got twinges in the morning, I do think that.’

Her own mother suffered from the progressive bone disease osteoporosis and endured a slow and painful end.

‘She said to me once, “I’m trying to die but I can’t”, oh God it was heart breaking. The brain was great but the body wasn’t,’ she said.

‘Eventually when she did die she was 84, it wasn’t a good experience. I think that’s what has made me feel like this.

‘My biggest fear is going like that when I can’t control my body.’

However, the mother-of-three, who also has two grandsons, said that although she agreed with clinics like Dignitas in Switzerland, where people can end their own lives, she didn’t plan to take matters into her own hands. 

She added: ‘I agree with Dignitas, but I couldn’t be the one to administer the poison that kills me. I know I couldn’t commit suicide. I’m too much of a coward, I couldn’t do it. I’d rather somebody make that decision for me.’

Best known for presenting Blind Date from 1985 to 2003, Miss Black has not officially retired but rarely makes TV appearances.

She had been due to star in a BBC sitcom with chat show host Paul O’Grady but the project was axed amid concerns she would be unable to stand the long filming hours.

Miss Black began her career more than 50 years ago as a singer, and had a string of top ten hits in the Sixties and Seventies.

After a brief time as a comedy actress, she became a TV presenter in the 1980s. Her husband Bobby Willis, who died in 1999 from cancer, was her manager for much of her career.

On Sunday she will collect a TV BAFTA special award in recognition of her outstanding contribution to entertainment.

She will receive the prize at the event - officially called the Arqiva British Academy Television Awards - on May 18 at the Theatre Royal, Drury Lane, in London and it will also be broadcast by BBC1.

It coincides with a new biopic of her life, starring actress Sheridan Smith.

The ITV drama from Jeff Pope will ‘capture the essence of 1960s Liverpool’.

It will also focus on how Black’s friendship with Ringo Starr brought her to the attention of Beatles' manager Brian Epstein and producer George Martin.
