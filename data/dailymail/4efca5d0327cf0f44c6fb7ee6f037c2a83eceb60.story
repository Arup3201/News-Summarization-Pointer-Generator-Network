More than a year has passed since Kate Middleton's father Michael walked her up the aisle to meet her groom Prince William.

Today the Duchess of Cambridge watched her father give away another beautiful bride as the Middleton family attended a society wedding.

Michael Middleton walked family friend Thierry Kelaart into St Bartholomew's church and down the aisle, standing in for her late father.

Sophisticated: The Duchess of Cambridge chose a pale blue knee-length dress and her trademark nude heels for the wedding, while sister Pippa wore a beige dress topped off with a jacket and matching fascinator

The elegant brunette tied the knot with 
groom Patrick Heathcote-Amory, a relative of Tory politician David 
Heathcote-Amory - whose career was marred by an expenses scandal in 
which he billed the cost of manure to the taxpayer.

Kate and Pippa looked glamorous as they watched the Church of England ceremony and the sounds of Glory Hallelujah could be heard ringing as the couple wed.

After the ceremony Kate's mother, Carole Middleton, led her daughters through a side door surrounded by other guests while the bride and groom stood in the entrance at the back of the church.

Fresh from her tour of Southeast Asia with husband Prince William, the Duchess of Cambridge wore a striking hat at the wedding of family friend Thierry Kelaart

Smiling Kate appeared eager to avoid the attention of photographers gathered at the church in Oxfordshire, keeping her head lowered beneath her hat

Surrounded by smartly dressed children 
the happy couple posed for photographs while guests lined the churchyard
 alongside them, while bells rang out in the background.

The bride and groom and their guests then made their way to a farmhouse next door to the church before other guests joined them and eventually Pippa, dressed in a cream suit jacket over a cream dress, followed.

Kate was not far behind as, surrounded by several male pals, she made her way quietly up the dirt path alongside the church building to the reception area.

Dressed elegantly in a long-sleeved turquoise dress, the future Queen turned her hat, positioned at an angle, to a bank of waiting press photographers to hide her face.

Fresh back from her tour of the Far East she appeared shy and reluctant to return to the limelight after the exhausting round of public appearances.

The Duchess did her best to remain in the background, avoiding upstaging the bride at the picturesque village wedding, in Nettlebed, near Henley-on-Thames, Oxfordshire.

A source at the church said: 'It went very well. The wedding was very well planned and it was a wonderful village occasion.

'As far as I'm aware the Middleton's are very, very old family friends of the bride.'

One wedding guest said: 'The wedding was lovely, absolutely lovely. I don't know why Michael Middleton was chosen to give the bride away but I know her father has passed away.'
