Family and friends of murdered Irish journalist Jill Meagher today said an emotional goodbye at her funeral.

The 29-year-old from Co Louth, Ireland, was raped and killed after a night out with colleagues in Melbourne, Australia, as she walked the short distance home to her husband.

Her grieving family and a small group of friends attended a private service at Fawkner Memorial Park in the city two weeks after the tragedy.

Last goodbye: The mourners released 29 white doves for Mrs Meagher - one for each year of her life

White ribbon wristbands were given to 
mourners to signify the fight to prevent violence against women and 29 
white doves were released at the end of the service, one for each year 
of Mrs Meagher's life.

Tears flowed as her husband Tom said a farewell in Gaelic: 'Slan abhaile no chara', meaning 'Safe home my friend.'

He spoke of their shared love of literature and how much his wife loved to go dancing, adding that she was always happiest when she was making others laugh.

'I couldn't ask for more loyalty, happiness and fun,' he said. 'Goodbye my beautiful, funny girl. I'll love you forever.'

Many of the women attending the service wore pink clothes and red shoes in memory of Mrs Meagher, a radio programme manager for the Australian Broadcasting Corporation.

Mourners danced to her favourite Queen song, Under Pressure, during the hour-long ceremony, to celebrate the ebullient woman's love of dancing.

Guests were driven to the service in buses, and Cordell Chapel was heavily protected by police.

Her father George McKeon fought back tears as he read a card he and his wife Edith had sent to their daughter in 2004, in which they told her how much they missed her, her laughter, energy and smile.

'It hard to be apart from you,' he read. 'So many of my thoughts are of you.

'Each night when the world is quiet and still, your smile and the wonderful moments we have shared crowd my mind. Then I find myself missing you even more.'

Mrs McKeon, from Boyle, Co. Roscommon, had travelling from Perth in western Australia for the service.

She said the family were overwhelmed by the outpouring of grief in both Australia and at home near Drogheda, where the young woman grew up.

She wrote on Facebook about her cherished memories of playing frisbee with the family in the park on their last meeting three weeks ago.

her uncle Michael, who had last seen his niece three weeks ago when she was on a trip home to Ireland, said: 'Gillian was a brilliant person, so happy, great worker, so in love with Tom - all the cliches, that was her.

'Tom and Gillian were a lovely couple and they don't deserve this - nobody does.'

In a statement released by the family yesterday, they said: ‘We understand your interest and that many of you are grieving with us. However, we also request that you allow us, our family and Jill’s friends time to grieve the loss of our beautiful wife, daughter and friend in privacy at this emotional time.

‘We would like to sincerely thank the public for their support, condolences and concern.’

Thousands took to the streets of Melbourne on Monday for a peace march Mrs Meagher's memory.

Mrs Meagher vanished after a night out with colleagues from ABC, and her body was found last Friday.

Adrian Bayley, 41, was arrested after leading police to her shallow grave.

The last image of Mrs Meagher on a shop's CCTV footage showed her talking to a man wearing a blue hoodie before she vanished.

'We miss your smile': George McKeon read out a letter at the service that he and his wife Edith had sent to their daughter in 2004

Happy moments: The family were reunited in Ireland three weeks ago, where they played a Frisbee game together

Safe journey: The 29-year-old was described as happy, fun, a keen dancer and a loyal companion

According to one witness report, a car made a U-turn on the street after Mrs Meagher walked past.

Her husband, Thomas, raised the alarm when she failed to make the short walk to her home less than a mile from Bar Etiquette.

Last weekend, 30,000 people marched in her memory in the north inner suburb of Brunswick, Melbourne, where Mrs Meagher lived after moving to Australia two years ago.

Thousands are expected to attend a memorial mass in St Peter's Church, Drogheda, at 7pm tonight.

A candlelit procession through the town will take place beforehand.
