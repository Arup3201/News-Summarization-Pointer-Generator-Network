Kirk Cameron is on a mission to make sure no one loses their joy this holiday season.

The sometime actor and full-time evangelical Christian recently posted a video on his Facebook page for all the ladies out there, and he knows just what they need to make this Christmas truly special - cooking, cleaning, singing and decorating.

He also wants them to know that they are 'irreplaceable.'

Christ almighty: The actor is also suggesting everyone check out his new film Kirk Cameron's Surviving Christmas, which is in theaters now

'Calling all moms, wives and keepers of your home - I made this video for you, to remind you of how irreplaceable you are to your family this Christmas,' says Cameron to his 2 million followers.

'If you are a mom, if you are a wife, if you're the keeper of your home, I want you to know that your joy is so important this Christmas.'

Joy is what Christmas is all about according to Cameron, and stolen joy can sap a person's strength he explains, before declaring the best way for a woman to experience joy during this very special time of the year.

'Let your children, your family, see your joy in the way that you decorate your home this Christmas, in the food that you cook, the songs you sing, the stories you tell, and the traditions that you keep,' says Cameron.

'Invite your whole neighborhood into your Christmas, and invite the world into our story of our king and his kingdom.'

He then plugs his new movie, which is in theaters today, Kirk Cameron's Saving Christmas.

The Los Angeles Times is calling the film an 'unholy mess,' while the Chicago Sun-Times declares it 'one of the least artful holiday films ever made.'

Cameron also took some time to talk to all of his male followers, and again promote his film, in a second video on his Facebook page this week.

This time around it was less about joy, and more about what the manly thing to do is this holiday season.

'Men. Fathers. Husbands. Sons. Our example in our family's life is so important at Christmastime. So be all in this year. Don't be a Bah Humbug. Support the women in your life,' says the former Growing Pains star.

'Put up the lights, prepare the house, and realize how blessed you are. Remember, Jesus came to serve. And so should you and I.'

Cameron also has ideas for other things men can do this Christmas.

'You know what the really manly thing to do this Christmas is? How about the dishes?! Or give your wife a good foot massage. That would be awesome! Because I'm thinking, she deserves it,' says Cameron. 

'And you know what another amazing thing you could do is? Take your whole family and see Saving Christmas.'

And for those who don't manage to catch Saving Christmas in theaters, but are hoping to see Cameron back in the spotlight, he will likely be making a television cameo on the popular reality series 19 Kids and Counting in the very near future as he attended the wedding of Jessa Duggar earlier this month.

Cameron declared Duggar's decision to not even kiss her future husband before their wedding day admirable, and took his two teenage daughters with him so they could see what he deemed a very special moment.

Kissing has long been incredibly sacred to Cameron, with the actor refusing to even kiss other women while filming, and demanding his wife Chelsea Noble serve as a stand-in for all scenes that require any tonsil hockey.
