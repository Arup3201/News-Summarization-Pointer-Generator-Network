A nurse who treated dozens of severely injured victims of the Peshawar school attack has revealed how she is haunted by memories of the dying children and says she has not been able to sleep since the massacre took place.

Despite having treated the victims of more than 300 terror attacks in her short career, Nargis Ghazi, 25, said the sight of scores of slaughtered children as young as five still wearing their uniforms on Tuesday has left her weeping continuously and unable to eat or drink.

Ms Ghazi says she encountered so many dead bodies during the attack that she barely recalls individual faces, but remembers the injuries suffered by the innocent children as horrific, as cold-blooded Taliban terrorists fired automatic weapons indiscriminately before blowing themselves up.

The young nurse spoke of her trauma amid as vigils and memorial services were held around the world for the 132 victims of the atrocity who were murdered at the school by six militants who carried out the attack on the orders of Pakistani Taliban leader Maulana Fazlullah.

Trauma: Nargis Ghazi, 25, said the sight of scores of slaughtered children as young as five still wearing their uniforms on Tuesday has left her weeping continuously and unable to eat or drink

Tears: Describing her inability to rest since the attack, Ms Ghazi said: 'Believe me, I couldn't have slept even for five minutes. I couldn't close my eyes. I have taken tablets but there has been no respite'

Speaking of the traumatic day, Ms Ghazi said frantic mothers were streaming in to Lady Reading Hospital, where she has worked since 2010, and running from bed to bed looking for their children in the hope they had somehow escaped being killed.

The tragic reality is that the search was in vain for as many as 132 of these mothers, as their beloved child's body lay riddled with bullets inside the school where they'd believe them to be safe.

Ms Ghazi described how, although she has treated the victims of 300 terror attacks, she has never had to deal with so many children victims before, as casualties are normally religious leaders or government officials.

Two days since the attack took place, the memories are as vivid as ever for both Ms Ghazi and her many traumatized colleagues.

'Whenever I close my eyes, their faces come in my mind. I can still hear their cries. One of my colleagues has been weeping continuously since Tuesday after seeing the children at hospital. She has not been eating,' Ms Ghazi said.

'We are in such bad condition after seeing them [the dead children]. I don't know how their mothers and sisters have been coping with the situation,' she added.

'This incident will not leave me rest of my life. I will never be able to forget those faces. Their cries and helplessness of their mothers and sisters and fathers and brothers,' she went on to say.

Describing her inability to rest since the attack, Ms Ghazi said: 'Believe me, I couldn't have slept even for five minutes. I couldn't close my eyes. I have taken tablets but there has been no respite.'

'I cannot sleep... I try to eat but vomit after a few minutes,' she added.

'Whenever I try to sleep, the children come in my dreams. I still can feel their cries and pain. I think if I am going through this, what must the mothers be feeling?,' she added.

In the aftermath of the attack, Ms Ghazi and her colleagues had been unable to console the victims' mothers because they had no idea what to say to them. 'They were in such [terrible] condition that we couldn't even gather the courage to console them... What could we say to them?' she said. 

Something else weighing heavily on the minds of the hospital workers is their own safety after the attack, with Ms Ghazi raising concerns that Lady Reading Hospital may be targeted by the Taliban.

'I am so worried about my security after the attack. You know their school was situated in high security zone near military offices. We live in hospital's hostel and we are so worried that terrorists can easily attack us. We may be their next target,' she said.

Ms Ghazi's comments came as Pakistanis united in grief over the Peshawar atrocity - with Muslims and Christians holding vigils and memorials for the victims of the Taliban slaughter.

Surprisingly a number of Islamic militant groups have also come forward to condemn the carnage.

Most such groups have slaughtered civilians themselves, but the wave of outrage following the school attack is threatening the relative freedom they enjoy in Pakistan.

The country is home to a range of armed militant groups. 

Some, like the Pakistani Taliban, fight against the state. Others have cosier ties with the authorities who use them against India and to jostle for influence in Afghanistan.

Whether Islamabad moves against all of them equally will show whether the school massacre has finally spurred authorities to tackle militancy seriously, said Senator Afrasiab Khattak.

'They are all terrorists and the state has to clearly oppose them in all shapes and colours...So far they have not done so,' he said.

The Afghan Taliban, a group Pakistani jihadists look up to, were the first of the Sunni Islamist armed groups to denounce the school attack as un-Islamic, despite often killing civilians themselves. 

An Afghan Taliban suicide bomber killed more than 50 people at a volleyball match last month.
