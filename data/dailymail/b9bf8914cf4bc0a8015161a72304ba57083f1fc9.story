A North Korean version of the Apple iPad has been developed by the secretive state, it has been revealed.

But the slick seven-inch tablet, called the 'Samjiyon', is unlikely to provide a window into life behind the secretive country's border as it can't connect to the internet.

Since its announcement in 2012, the computer has been developed using a basic version of Google's android software.

And, after being put on general sale in North Korea, reviews on technology websites have begun to filter through into the outside world.

Compared to its pricey western versions, the Samjiyon costs the equivalent around £155 and comes with a selection of pre-loaded apps, one of which is a version of Angry Birds.

Although the handheld device cannot access the world wide web, it is designed to be able to connect to North Korea's own intranet, where state propaganda, news, TV programs and educational apps are hosted.

One of the apps is a language acquisition tool which teaches users basic English.

It also comes loaded with over 100 eBooks, although they, like the intranet come with a nationalistic theme. Most of the publications are about North Korean political, military and cultural history.

The hend held device is smaller than the latest iPad air with a 7inch 1,024 by 768 pixel display, comapred to the Apple machine's 9.7inch 2,048 by 1,536 resolution.

The machine is only likely to be available to a select few in North Korea, with the majority of the population having nowhere near the disposable incomes required to splash out on tech.

But it seems that the regime known for closely guarding its state activities is happy for their technology to pass freely over its borders.

One reviewer on the website NorthKoreaTech told how they were allowed to buy the item before taking it freely through an airport and into a neighbouring country.

After having a play around with the product, the tech blogger said the performance of the tablet was comparable to western models.

The review reads: 'I can honestly say that the Samjiyon is surprisingly impressive.

TALE OF THE TABLETS - TECH SPECS OF THE iPAD AND THE SAMJIYON

'In terms of responsiveness and speed, it can almost compete against the leading tablets out there.

'Tapping and launching apps feels fairly fluid, instantiating the camera is as fast as the world’s leading tablets, and there is no noticeable lag when playing games I’m familiar with, like Angry Birds.'

One of those who has seen the the tablet is Professor Ruediger Frank from the University of Vienna, writing on the tech blog 38 North, he said: 'The tablet has obviously been made for people who mainly use it offline.

'This gadget is not available to all North Koreans; just as a Mercedes Benz S-class sedan is out of reach for most Germans.

'The existence of this tablet does not in any way change the fact that [North Korea] is, for many of its people, a country of hard manual labour and simple living conditions.

'The Samjiyon is a useful and entertaining device for a minority in a totalitarian system with a dominant ideology.'
