Police in India have charged a man with the murder of British backpacker Sarah Groves two months ago.

Dutch tourist Richard De Wit was arrested after 24-year-old Miss Groves was found stabbed to death on a houseboat in Kashmir in April.

She had suffered 45 knife wounds, most on her fingers, hands and arms, indicating she had fought ferociously for her life.

De Wit, 43, was formally charged on Monday and is due to appear in court in Srinagar on June 15 when he is expected to enter a plea.

Indian police believe Miss Groves met her alleged killer during her travels in Goa.

She was attacked in her room on a houseboat hotel on Srinagar's picturesque Lake Dal in the early hours of April 5.

Police said De Wit swam to shore and hailed a taxi but was stopped 45 miles away and arrested.

He is said to have confessed to killing her after smoking cannabis, triggering delusions that she was a Dutch spy.

Detectives are also probing claims that Miss Groves, a friend of Princess Beatrice, was conned out of money before her death.

De Wit is being held in the region's central jail having received treatment in a government-run psychiatric hospital.

Miss Groves's parents Victor and Kate told the Daily Mail last month that they had begged their daughter not to go to the region.

Ownership of the territory is under dispute by India and Pakistan, and the area has for many years been targeted by terrorists and militants.

So fearful were Mr and Mrs Groves for their daughter’s safety that they had booked a trip to Nepal, where they were planning to meet her at the base camp of Mount Everest.

The trip was arranged specifically to persuade Sarah to leave Kashmir, but tragically she died before that planned reunion with her parents.

In July 2012, Sarah had posted a message
on Facebook, writing: ‘Quit your job, buy a ticket, get a tan, fall in love, never 
return.’

Two days before the murder, De Wit, 43, booked onto the New Beauty houseboat on Dal Lake in Srinagar.

Sarah had been staying on the boat for a month with her new boyfriend, Saeed Ahmed Shoda, whom she had met on her travels, and his family.

Immediately after his arrest, De Wit apparently told them ‘the Devil took hold of my body’.

But police revealed last month that De Wit had bought the knife with which he stabbed Sarah hours before the killing, suggesting it was a premeditated act.

It had initially been believed he already had the knife in his possession when he arrived in Kashmir.

Miss Groves was born in Manchester in 1988, moving to Guernsey when she was four with her parents. She and her older half-brothers, Ben, 26, and Tom, 31, grew up in a large manor house on the island.

Miss Groves was educated at two prestigious independent Catholic schools, first at Blanchelande College in Guernsey, then as a boarder at the £30,000-a-year St Mary’s College in Ascot, Berkshire.

She studied at Chelsea College of Art and Design in London before returning to Guernsey, having decided to become a fitness instructor.

After qualifying, she worked for two years at the five-star Old Government House Hotel, leaving last August after deciding to go travelling.

In October, she arrived in Tanzania, where she climbed Mount Kilimanjaro, before flying to New Delhi in February this year.

She was undeterred by Foreign Office advice that women should use caution when travelling in India; there have been a number of sexual attacks against British women in the country including in Goa, where Sarah travelled after Delhi.

‘She was happy, but we were keen that she didn’t stay too long,’ Mr Groves told a press conference in Guernsey last month.

In Goa, Sarah met Saeed Shoda, 25, a Kashmiri who was on holiday there. They became besotted with each other, and Saeed invited her to stay on his parents’ houseboat on Dal Lake.

Sarah had been planning to go on to Sri Lanka, but was so taken with Shoda that she agreed to change her plans.

‘We tried so hard to stop her going,’ Mr Groves told the press conference.

‘It is nothing against the guy, but sadly she met someone and, instead of going to Sri Lanka, she went north.’

Sarah travelled to Kashmir in April and moved onto the New Beauty houseboat, which has a number of basic, furnished rooms for rent to tourists.

Doctors said that Miss Groves's injuries revealed she fought for her life

She helped Shoda's mother, Hafiza, paint the railings on the deck in preparation for the summer visitors, calling her ‘mother’ in Kashmiri.

She spoke to her parents nearly every day on the phone, but those conversations did not assuage their fears for their daughter.

Victor and Kate, 66, decided to book a trip to Nepal — and persuaded Sarah to meet them there as a way of enticing her away from Kashmir.

‘We didn’t want to separate them [Sarah and Saeed] long-term, but Sarah wanted to see so many places and she got caught up in something which meant she only saw two places,’ Mr Groves told the press conference.

He also spoke heart-rendingly of the close bond between Sarah and her mother.

‘The relationship between Sarah and my wife, Kate, was always very, very close. They made each other laugh all the time,’ he said.

De Wit turned up at Dal Lake and booked into the New Beauty houseboat.

The following day, Saeed left to visit friends for a couple of days. He says he invited Miss Groves to go with him, but she chose to stay behind.

Last October, De Wit abandoned his wife Uma Rupanya and two daughters to go travelling.

In a video posted on YouTube from Zurich in December last year, De Wit said he had been receiving psychiatric treatment, but believed his doctors had been acting on behalf of the security services to spy on him and others.

He claimed to have been visited by intelligence agents who believed he was a far-Right republican posing a threat to Queen Beatrix of the Netherlands.

After Miss Groves's murder, his wife said he had stopped taking his anti-psychotic medication and had begun smoking cannabis.

Sarah was introduced to De Wit on the Friday, when they had a brief chat.

According to one local who spoke to Saeed’s family, Sarah had borrowed the Dutchman’s camera and put her memory card into it, although this has not been confirmed.

It seems Saeed’s mother was uneasy about Sarah staying alone on the houseboat with De Wit, and asked if she wanted to spend the night in her room. Sarah declined, saying she wanted to read her book.

In the early hours of the morning, she was disturbed by the Dutchman, who forced open the door to her room armed with a 12in knife.

Sarah suffered 45 wounds to her body, most of them defensive cuts as she tried to fight off her attacker.

But she also received two fatal wounds, one to her neck and another to a lung, and bled to death.

The Shoda family were woken by screams and what sounded like an argument. Shoda’s brother and father ran to investigate, and found Sarah lying in a pool of blood in her room.

Out on the river, they saw De Wit rowing a boat towards the shore, but it capsized, and he had to swim ashore.

He flagged down a taxi but was arrested in Qazigund, 50 miles away, still wet and wearing no shoes.

Later, Shoda’s mother discovered a missed call on her mobile from Miss Groves, who had desperately phoned for help.

A doctor from the post-mortem team who examined Sarah’s body, who asked to remain anonymous, told the Mail there was no sexual assault before she was killed.
