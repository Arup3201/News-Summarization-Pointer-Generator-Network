The man convicted of gunning down three Royal Canadian Mounted Police officers in a rampage  was given life in prison, the country's harshest sentence in 50 years.

The life sentence was handed down to Justin Bourque on Friday for the murder of three officers and wounding of two others in Moncton, New Brunswick, on June 4.

Dressed in combat fatigues with a shotgun slung across his back, Bourque shot several Mounted Police officers with what he later testified was a semi-automatic rifle.

Guilty: Justin Bourque, 24, was sentenced to life in prison with no parole for 75 years, the country's harshest punishment since 1962

Moncton, a city of nearly 70,000 was on lockdown for 30 hours as a manhunt followed before Bourque finally surrendered to law enforcement on a homeowner's lawn.

His sentence will be the harshest in Canada since 1962, when two men were hanged for murder.

RCMP Assistant Commissioner Roger Brown found the long sentence for Bourque a fitting punishment.

'This probably was one of the worst crimes that we've ever seen in our country,' Brown said. 'We saw three of our own gunned down because of the job they do.'

Due to the first degree murder charge, Bourque was already facing a mandatory life sentence after being convicted. He will be 99 when he's first eligible for parole.

First degree murder convicts in Canada are normally given life with no parole for 25 years, after which they can apply for parole.

The prosecution asked the court for the maximum sentence of 75 years based on an amended section of Canada's Criminal Code, while the defense argued for parole at 50 years.

It was the second-deadliest attack on RMCP in 120 years, after the 2005 killing of four RMCP officers in Alberta. 

During his sentencing hearing, a video tape of Bourque saying he wanted to start an insurrection against the 'soldiers' defending federal institutions and protecting the rich. 

'I know this is going to sound pretty messed up, but I felt pretty accomplished,' he told police. 

'I miss my husband every minute of every day. He cannot ever be replaced,' said Rachael Ross, widow of one of the officers, said outside court.

Nadine Larche said the sentence means their children will unlikely be subject to parole hearings. 

According to witnesses of the shooting, the first gunshots came from a wooded area about 100 yards from the trailer park where Bourque lives in the northwest part of the city.

After the first shooting, police sighted the killer three times prowling the city, including once at 8am near Moncton's Costco.

During another call Thursday afternoon, patrol cars and armored trucks surrounded a building in the area, presumably thinking Bourque was inside, but they later dispersed.

'We received some information and did a search and it was unfounded,' a RCMP spokesperson said. 

At one point, Bourque was seen coming in and out of a wooded area, said Commander Marlene Snowman, who added that Bourque was not known to police, meaning that he had never been seen as a cause for concern by officials before his rampage.

Schools and government offices were closed, and the city pulled its buses off the roads. Mail delivery was suspended.

Commanding Officer Roger Brown said the two wounded officers underwent surgery for non-life-threatening injuries Thursday and he met with their families. One was later released from hospital.

Bourque finally surrendered to police in the lawn of Michelle Thibodeau, 21, who watched his arrest. 

She said she heard the suspect say, 'I'm done,' before officers, some with their guns drawn, arrested him.
