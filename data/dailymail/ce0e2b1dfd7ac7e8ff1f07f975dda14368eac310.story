Prime Minister David Cameron has warned those who choose to cash in their pension early under Government reforms that they could end up paying more for their care later in life.

It comes after George Osborne announced in the latest Budget that savers would be allowed to withdraw money from their pension pots as they wish when they retire.

However, under Government reforms, those who have assets worth more than £118,000, including their own homes, will have to pay for their own social care.

Prime Minister David Cameron said people 'have a choice' about whether they decide to withdraw a lump sum from their pension or take out an annuity

It has prompted fears that those who choose to withdraw a large amount of money from their pension pot will be pushed over the threshold and forced into spending their saved cash on their care bills.

However, Mr Cameron said people ‘have a choice’ about whether they decide to withdraw a lump sum from their pension or take out an annuity.

According to The Telegraph, he said: ‘I know there is a concern that if you take your money out of your pension pot and have it as your own money, it counts as your money when you are assessed for care needs. That is true, that is the case, but you have the choice.’

From April 2016, the Government will introduce a limit of £72,000 on the amount any one person has to pay for social care.

The Prime Minister said the cap would help those who faced hefty bills for social care and nursing homes.

He said: ‘I think there was a great unfairness that, if you were hit with dementia, sometimes at a relatively young age, you could be faced with hundreds of thousands of pounds in nursing homes, eating up every last penny of savings.

‘Putting a cap on the maximum amount is a fair and good step to take’, reported the Telegraph.

Last week, Chancellor George Osborne announced big changes for pensioners in his Budget 2014.

He unveiled the most radical reform of pensions for a century which will allow workers nearing retirement to transform their private pension pots into bank accounts.

It will abolish the need for some pensioners to buy annuity, meaning individuals will be free to spend their nest eggs as they like.

Mr Osborne also revealed new ‘pensioner bonds’, issued by National Savings and Investments, which will launch in January 2015 with an investment limit of £10,000 each.

Setting out his pitch to voters ahead of the 2015 general election, he declared: ‘If you’re a maker, a doer or a saver: this Budget is for you.

‘We set out our plan and together with the British people, we held our nerve. We’re putting Britain right.’

The new bonds aimed at pensioners will be offered with market-beating interest rates, with over 65s potentially being offered a four-year bond paying interest of around four per cent.

Restrictions on pension pots will be reduced from Thursday and individuals with savings of £30,000 or less will be able to withdraw the full amount if they wish – which is nearly double the current £18,000 limit – with marginal tax rates.

Then from April 2015, pensioners will be able to withdraw the entirety of their pensions from the age of 55.

It means an individual with a £100,000 pension could take the first £25,000 tax free and then withdraw the remaining £75,000 but pay tax on it.
