Derided advice: NHS adviser Jayne Morris was inspired to give napping advice after her time in Japan where companies offer lunchtime snoozes

NHS Online's life coaching expert Jayne Morris is under fire today for saying that overworked staff should keep a pillow under their desk in case they need a snooze at work.

Jayne Morris advised grabbing a 20 minute 'power nap' to recharge workers' batteries, even in the middle of the working day.

Napping employees may not go down well with British bosses.

However, Ms Morris insists that it would make our workforce less stressed, enabling the brain 'to clear thought clutter and boost creativity'.

She said: 'Naps can be taken almost 
any time, any place, if you get creative.

Keep a pillow under your desk 
or a blanket in your car.'

She acknowledged that some may need to 
mentally prepare by getting rid of guilty feelings.

She advised: 'Release any inner gremlins telling you that you are lazy for napping. Remind yourself of the benefits.'

If
workers cannot sleep easily at their 
desks then she suggests they ‘pop in some earplugs, wear an eye mask or 
close the blinds’.

This can be any time, anywhere, she 
said, including the office, the car and even ‘at the back of a yoga or 
pilates class to drop off for a while during the class.’

Matthew Sinclair, Chief Executive of the TaxPayers’ Alliance, was shocked at the idea.

He
said: 'When there is serious pressure on health budgets, taxpayers will
find it astonishing that NHS Online is spending money on a ‘life 
coach’.'

'It is all the more
absurd that the coach is suggesting that office workers sleep on the 
job. If they’re taking that advice seriously, it’s little wonder the 
economy is stagnating.'

Ms Morris explained her inspiration: 'I worked in Japan for three years where burnout is a massive problem. Over there they dim all the lights at lunchtime in some companies and let everyone have a little snooze.'

'In Spain they have siestas, though that’s to do with the weather.'

'If we are shifting to longer working hours then you either manage it better or support it better.'
