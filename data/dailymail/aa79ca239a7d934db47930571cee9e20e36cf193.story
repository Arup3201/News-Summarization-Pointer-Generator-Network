Lord Sugar last night launched a scathing attack on Apprentice winner Stella English after she lost a constructive dismissal claim against him, saying ‘she picked the wrong person’.

The multi-millionaire heralded the tribunal’s decision as a victory against Britain’s compensation culture, and vowed to begin a personal crusade against ‘ambulance-chasing lawyers’.

Lord Sugar branded Miss English, 34, a ‘money-grabber’ and a ‘chancer’, claiming she had launched a sham case against him in the hope he would pay out to avoid an embarrassing confrontation in court.

He warned that disgruntled employees 
had been allowed to use the tribunal system to effectively blackmail 
small businesses into settling claims.

He added: ‘This case was a sham and a
total abuse of a tribunal system which is there to protect employees 
who have been mistreated. It is not there to aid those chancing their 
arm at landing a big payday.

‘I hope that other companies will learn  from this example and also fight off derisory claims.’

Victory: Stella beat rival Chris Bates in the 2010 final of the show but she said the job was not what she hoped

Lord Sugar, 66, said the allegations 
against him were ‘tantamount to blackmail’, adding:  ‘I’m afraid she 
underestimated me and her reputation is now in tatters.’

Stella English was known on The Apprentice as the 'ice maiden' due to her cool demeanour, but wept when she found out she had won a £100,000 contract with Lord Sugar.

The mother-of-two had given up her job in banking after progressing in the sixth series of the BBC show but stressed that all the hard work had been worth it when she beat 15 others to win the talent search.

She was tearful as she thanked Lord Sugar for offering her a job, having been described by the peer as 'well-liked and determined to get on with whatever you're asked to do'.

The 34-year-old, who left school with no qualifications, said on the BBC after winning that the challenge had been 'convincing other people'.

In the interview, conducted in the back of a chauffeur-driven car, she said: 'I'm so excited about the future. It's all been worth it. All the blood, sweat and tears. I've got through to the end and I'm just so happy.'

Months later, the cracks were starting to appear however when she started work at IT firm Viglen, a position she ended up stepping down from before then joining television set-top box company YouView.

Lord Sugar had praised Miss English on the show for showing determination, noting her background and the fact she had fought to educate herself.

Miss English was brought up by relatives on a council estate and then worked her way up the career ladder to an £82,500-a-year job in a Japanese investment bank before applying to take part in The Apprentice.

The tribunal heard Miss English is currently working in IT, but in interviews she has spoken of plans to launch her own fashion range of business clothing. She lives with her sons and husband in Whitstable, Kent.

In a unanimous written judgment, the tribunal panel said: ‘This was a claim which should never have been brought.’

The Apprentice star’s tirade marked 
the end of a bitter legal battle between him and Miss English, who won 
the hit BBC1 show in 2010.

Her prize was a £100,000 job in one 
of Lord Sugar’s subsidiary companies, but she walked away from the 
year-long contract after just five months, claiming she was used as ‘an 
overpaid lackey’.

The mother-of-two, who gave up a 
£82,500 salary in the City to go on The Apprentice, said her new 
colleagues shunned her because she was recruited through the TV show.

On her first day at work she claimed 
she was told: ‘The cameras have stopped rolling now … Welcome to the 
real world, there is no job.’ Miss English said she felt ostracised 
while she worked at Viglen, which supplies IT equipment to schools, 
universities and hospitals. Far from being mentored by Lord Sugar, she 
said she only saw him five times while she worked there.

Miss English told the tribunal that 
when she asked Lord Sugar for feedback, he replied: ‘The feedback is: 
“Nice girl, don’t do a lot”.’

During a confrontation over her role, she claimed Lord Sugar told her: ‘I’ve met my obligations to you.

‘I did it for the BBC and the 
integrity of the show and a bit of my own PR and a bit of yours too. But
the fact is that I don’t give a s***.’

Lord Sugar denied her claims and 
yesterday the East London employment tribunal dismissed Miss English’s 
case, saying there was no evidence to support her allegation that she 
was unfairly treated. Contestants in the show were warned Lord Sugar 
would not be their line manager and that they would rarely see him, the 
three-strong panel ruled.

Miss English was given ‘a real job’ but resigned after discovering the reality of working in the tycoon’s empire, it said.

Miss English, who lives in Whitstable, Kent, with her husband Ray Dewar, was unavailable for comment.

Dewar, now a builder, was a notorious
hardman linked to Clifford Norris, the gangster father of David Norris,
one of the convicted killers of Stephen Lawrence.

Lord Sugar was defiant as he gave evidence in the employment tribunal and was vindicated today when the panel rejected Ms English's claim

He styles himself as Britain's most belligerent boss and is known for his ruthless grilling of contestants on The Apprentice.

But when a former winner of the television show decided to sue Lord Sugar, he was the one facing questions for a change.

Lord Sugar's no-nonsense style is now familiar to thousands of television viewers thanks to the reality series which started in 2005. It spawned the catchphrases 'You're fired!' and 'You're hired!' - the latter of which he said to 2010 winner Stella English, who is the first of the show's contestants to take Lord Sugar to an employment tribunal.

Before the cameras started rolling, Lord Sugar had been a businessman for decades. The East End boy started off selling electrical goods from the back of a van and then founded Amstrad in 1968, which later went into manufacturing. He stepped down as chairman of the firm, which now sells set-top boxes, in 2008.

The Labour peer currently has a string of businesses under his belt. They include advertising brand Amscreen, private air travel firm Amsair and property firms Amsprop - the 'Ams' prefix representing his initials Alan Michael Sugar.

He stepped down as chairman of YouView, the television catch-up service that employed Ms English after she left Lord Sugar's IT company Viglen, earlier this year.

More recently, he has also invested in products dreamed up by winners of The Apprentice, as the format has changed since Miss English won the show. That fact explains why Lord Sugar, a fan of social media, can often be found extolling the virtues of the s-shaped nail file created by series winner Tom Pellereau on Twitter.

Outside the world of business, Lord Sugar has been involved in several spats with high-profile figures on Twitter - and most recently took offence at followers who tweeted "foul-mouth comments" on his tribute to Baroness Thatcher, describing them as 'despicable scum'.

Last year he angered Donald Trump, star of the American version of The Apprentice, when he told him that 'Scottish don't want wind turbines' and 'The Scottish don't want you!'.

Trump replied by saying Lord Sugar 'should not be doing The Apprentice', and added: 'Without my show you'd be nothing!'

He also engaged in a war of words with X Factor judge Tulisa Contostavlos, after firing off the missive: 'This Tulisa talks nonsense on X factor, what qualifications does she have to judge singing talent. Please advise where I am missing the point."

The N-Dubz singer replied by telling Lord Sugar: 'As someone that came from nothing to something maybe u should have a little more respect for people that have done the same.'

In his personal life, Lord Sugar is an ardent Tottenham Hotspur fan, and used to be chairman of the club. He collects Rolls Royce and Bentley cars - one bearing the personalised number plate AMS1.He is married with three children and is reportedly worth £770 million.
