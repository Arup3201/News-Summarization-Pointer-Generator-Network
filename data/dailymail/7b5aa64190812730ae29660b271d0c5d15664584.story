Deputy Labor leader Tanya Plibersek has revealed her leader and 'friend' Bill Shorten has had a 'pretty bad week' following historical rape allegations levelled against him.

Ms Plibersek opened an address to 400 Queensland Party members at a Brisbane conference on Saturday, where she admitted Mr Shorten's revelations had played a toll on him.

The Labor leader said on Thursday he was the subject of an investigation into rape claims stemming from a Young Labor camp he attended near Geelong in 1986.

Addressing the Queensland Australian Labor Party's 51st state conference in Brisbane, Ms Plibersek said: 'My friend Bill Shorten would have loved to have been here with you today.'

'Bill's had a pretty bad week but he's had a wonderful year.'

Aside from this week's allegations Mr Shorten had to deal with the death of his mother Ann in April but has performed well in the opinion polls, especially in light of an unpopular budget.

A police investigation cleared the Labor leader who called the rape allegations 'untrue and abhorrent.'

Mrs Plibersek's comments come after Mr Shorten addressed the media on Friday to confirm Victorian Police had investigated claims made by a woman on Facebook last year.

Mr Shorten today released a brief statement in Melbourne which confirmed police had dropped their investigation into claims he described as 'untrue and abhorrent'.

'I will not go into the details, except to say that the allegation was untrue and abhorrent,' Mr Shorten said at a press conference.

Mr Shorten revealed the investigation had been difficult for he and his wife Chloe Bryce, the daughter of former Governor-General Quentin Bryce.

'This has been deeply distressing for my family,' he added.

'I'm thankful for the love and support of Chloe and the support of my staff and parliamentary colleagues.'

The alleged victim made claims on Facebook last year that they were assaulted at a Young Labor camp near Geelong in 1986.

'Investigating police sought advice from the Office of Public Prosecutions, which advised there was no reasonable prospect of conviction,' read a statement from Victoria Police.

'All parties have been notified that Victoria Police will not be proceeding with criminal charges.'

According to Mr Shorten's lawyer, the claims 'go back about 30 years to when he was a teenager'

Richard Marles, the Shadow Minister for Immigration and Border Protection and a longtime friend of Mr Shorten, told 2GB on Thursday afternoon that it had been 'one of the worst moments of Bill's life'.

'I first met Bill in 1987 and I have been a close friend of Bill since that time. I know that these allegations are not true, because the person I've known is simply not capable of undertaking the allegations that have been made against him,' he told Ben Fordham on his radio program on 2GB.

'I have no idea what the motivations are behind the allegations that have been made.

'There's just no way that any of this was possible. These allegations surface almost immediately upon Bill becoming the leader of the Labor Party.

'It's been a really difficult time for Bill. I think this has been one of the worst moments of Bill's life. I think with this being dealt with in the background shows how tough a guy he is.'

Earlier Mr Shorten's lawyer issued a statement earlier, saying the claims were 'unsubstantiated'.

'My client has maintained from the outset that the claim, which goes back about 30 years to when he was a teenager, was untrue and that he would be cleared,' he said.

'I fully cooperated to clear my name and that is what I’ve done. I freely answered all the questions that the police asked of me,' he added.

'The easy option would be to say nothing, but that is not who I am. I want to address this myself directly.'

The woman was reported to be a nurse who now lives in NSW after she made a formal complaint to police last year.

'The police have conducted an investigation they have vigorously and thoroughly investigated it and the matter is now closed,' Mr Shorten added.

'The decision speaks for itself I have no intention after this statement to talk about it any further.'

Late last year I learned that a claim had been made about me, going back to when I was nineteen. It was made on social media, when I was elected Opposition Leader. 

I will not go into details, except to say that the allegation was untrue and abhorrent.

The allegation was made by someone I knew briefly at that time. 

There is absolutely no basis for the claim. 

The claim has now been thoroughly and rigorously investigated by police, as is entirely proper.

I fully cooperated to clear my name. And that is what I have done. 

I freely answered all questions the police asked of me.

Now the police investigation has concluded, I can make this statement.

This has been deeply distressing for my family.

I am thankful for the love and support of Chloe, and the support of my staff and parliamentary colleagues.

Others who were aware of the investigation have acted with the utmost integrity by leaving the police to do their job.

The police have now concluded the investigation. 

The decision speaks for itself.

It is over.  

I have no intention of making any further comment.
