Leeds United owner Massimo Cellino has promised to kick out any player guilty of racism but defended Giuseppe Bellusci against Norwich striker Cameron Jerome’s claims.

The Football Association are investigating Jerome’s allegation of racist abuse by the Leeds defender during the 1-1 draw at Carrow Road on Tuesday.

Jerome complained to referee Mark Clattenburg that he was racially insulted by the 25-year-old Italian in the first half.

But Cellino insists Bellusci, a summer signing from Catania, said nothing of a racist nature.

‘Bellusci is no racist,’ Cellino told the Yorkshire Evening Post. ‘I spoke with him and he said, “You must be joking, I said nothing like this to him”.

‘I don’t allow racists at this club and I won’t allow racists at this club ever. If one of my players is a racist, I’ll kick him out before the FA has a chance.

‘Bellusci says he spoke (to Jerome) in Italian. I don’t know if he (Jerome) speaks Italian too but Bellusci swears to me he said nothing racist. I believe him and I’ll support him.’

Jerome said on Twitter he would not publicly reveal what was said and would leave it to the FA. ‘I made (an allegation) to the referee which he will write in his match report,’ he said.
