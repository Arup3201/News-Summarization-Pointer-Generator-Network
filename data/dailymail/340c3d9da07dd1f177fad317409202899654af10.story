Vile: The original Human Centipede movie came out in 2009

Dutch director Tom Six’s 2011 film, Human Centipede II (Full Sequence), is one of the most repellent exercises in sexual sadism that I have ever witnessed in a cinema.

Its 2009 predecessor, The Human Centipede, was an amazingly unpleasant horror film about a mad scientist joining three people together surgically.

Evidently, Mr Six thought this hadn’t gone far enough, for last year he came up with the sequel, which is roughly ten times more extreme, filthy and psychopathic than the original.

The sadistic anti-hero Martin (played with slobbering relish by Laurence R Harvey) is a huge fan of the first Human Centipede movie.

An obese, inarticulate, retarded man who lives with his mother, Martin gets his kicks by abducting motorists from a multi-storey car park and taking them to a disused warehouse, where he attempts to join 12 of them together as a human centipede with one digestive system.

To this end, he maims, cuts, slices off pieces of anatomy, indulges in sadistic, unskilled dentistry, rapes them and forces them into other vile acts.

The producers of this exercise in extended sexual aggression proudly advertised it as ‘a film so sick the BBFC didn’t want you to see it!’

The British Board of Film Classification did, indeed, initially deny the film an 18 certificate on the grounds that no amount of cuts could overcome the central problem – that the plot revolves around the sexual arousal of the central character by the torture and degradation of others.

However, in perhaps the most lily-livered act in its inglorious history, the board reversed that decision after an appeal by the film’s distributors.

A total of 32 cuts were made, totalling 2 minutes 37 seconds, but these did little to disguise anything that was happening.

Gore: Directors such as Eli Roth, pictured, would have seen many of their films blocked by the censors before 1996, says Christopher Tookey

Sadly, The Human Centipede II is not an isolated example, and one movie – A Serbian Film – is even more disgusting in its celebration of sexual torture.

The truth is that ever since it let through another exercise in sexual sadism, Crash, in 1996, the BBFC has repeatedly allowed 18 certificates for films that wallow in sexual degradation, rape and torture.

Mostly these were abstruse foreign-language films. More recently, however, a new genre of mainstream, English-language films has sprung up, often called ‘torture porn’, in which Eli Roth and other directors have wallowed in the erotic degradation of both sexes.

Many of these have had ‘Hostel’ or ‘Saw’ in the title, but there are dozens of them, and as a film critic I have had the misfortune to see them all. None of them would have got past the censors before 1996.

If, at long last, the authorities are starting to see sense and realise that films like this do influence people in real life, it’s not before time.

Several questions need to be answered much more honestly than they have been.

Should the opportunists responsible for films like this be ashamed of themselves? Yes.

Do films like this help to brutalise some of those who see them? Of course. Does the British Board of Film Classification care? Not sufficiently.

Do we all have to live with the social and criminal consequences? Yes.

Degrading: So-called 'torture-porn' films such as Hostel, pictured, have emerged and 'wallow in the erotic degradation of both sexes' according to Christopher Tookey

Slipping standards: Censorship hasn't been the same according to Christopher Tookey since 1996 film Crash, starring James Spader, pictured, made it through the net

He says that such films would never have made it past the censors before controversial 1996 film Crash
