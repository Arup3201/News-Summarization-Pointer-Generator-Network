Stalking: Former Aston Villa goalkeeper Matthew Ghent, 32, admitted harassing his ex-lover relentlessly

He could scarcely look more arrogant if he tried.

Bathing in banknotes, this is Matthew 
Ghent, a former professional footballer who left his ex-girlfriend 
suicidal after a relentless campaign of harassment against her.

Just weeks before he admitted the 
charges in court, he posted this photograph on his Facebook page, 
showing himself sitting in a bathtub full of cash, cigarette in one hand
and a glass of wine in the other.

He even gloated that he had hidden the £50 notes underneath the £20s to avoid being too ostentatious.

He wrote: ‘Because I can. Go **** 
yourself’, adding: ‘The bottom layers were actually 20s/50s. I thought 
it was too “bling” to put 50s on top.’

A court heard the former Aston Villa 
and England youth goalkeeper booked a holiday for the couple after the 
woman broke up with him, then began stalking her when she refused to go 
on the trip.

Ghent bombarded her with 70 emails and
text messages, paid money into her online PayPal account and turned up 
at her office, not leaving until the woman’s colleagues threatened to 
call police.

He left the 30-year-old victim feeling ‘trapped and 
isolated’, the court heard.

In a victim impact statement the woman
said she was left always ‘looking over her shoulder’ and that, almost a
year on from the ordeal, she was considering abandoning her career as a
prison officer for a ‘fresh start’ abroad.

It is not the first time 
Ghent has been convicted of harassing an ex-partner. In 2006 he was 
jailed for three months for attacking and stalking his then girlfriend, 
Maria Morris.

A court heard he had kicked her in the
stomach when she was pregnant with their son and throttled her because 
he didn’t like how she decorated the Christmas tree.

Ghent was in the full Aston  Villa 
squad for three seasons between 1997 and 2000 and was often a 
substitute, but never played for the first team and was eventually 
released.

He went on to play for Barnsley and Lincoln City, then lower 
league teams Tamworth and Solihull Moors.

He retired in 2008 and now sells hair and beauty products online.

Ghent admitted harassment and was 
handed a ten-week suspended prison sentence at Northampton Magistrates’ 
Court.

The prosecutor told the court that Ghent, pictured above, had been 'very controlling' during the relationship

He was also given a two-year supervision order, ordered to take 
part in a domestic abuse programme, handed a restraining order banning 
him from contacting the victim and told to pay her £750 in compensation.

Sentencing, deputy district Judge Elizabeth Harte said Ghent was guilty
of an ‘exceptionally unpleasant case of true stalking behaviour.’

The judge added: ‘If you fail to 
moderate your behaviour, you will go to prison for a long time.’ 
Prosecutor Julia Barnett told the court the couple met on a dating 
website, and Ghent had been ‘very controlling’ during their turbulent 
six-month relationship.

They broke up last May and Ghent was 
given a harassment warning by police after the victim complained. He 
booked the holiday in July, and the stalking began afterwards.

Mark Moore, defending, said Ghent, 
from Tamworth, in Staffordshire, accepted he sent a ‘number of emails 
and messages but they were not threatening in nature’.
