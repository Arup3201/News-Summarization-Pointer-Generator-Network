U2 frontman Bono has defended Ireland's controversial business tax policies - claiming the large companies which avoid paying billions bring prosperity to the country.

The tax deals Ireland struck with Apple in 1991 and 2007 have come under the microscope of the European Commission, which has warned Apple may yet be required to pay billions in backdated tax.

In a letter released last month, it warned Ireland could be granting the company illegal rebates worth billions of dollars.

Apple funnels the bulk of its international sales through subsidiaries in Ireland - where it benefits from low, negotiated tax deals.

But doubts have been raised over their compatibility with EU law as it is a practice the commission believes 'constitutes state aid'.

But in an interview with the Observer, Bono has defended Ireland's business-friendly reputation and said the tax policies had brought the country prosperity by attracting people.

He said: 'We are a tiny little country, we don’t have scale, and our version of scale is to be innovative and to be clever, and tax competitiveness has brought our country the only prosperity we’ve known. 

Bono was nominated for the Nobel Peace Prize in 2003 for his attempts to alleviate third world debt and has campaigned to raise AIDS awareness in Africa.

He told the paper: 'We don’t have natural resources, we have to be able to attract people.'

He added that Ireland had benefited from 'more hospitals and firemen and teachers because of [the tax] policies'. 

If the commission ruled Apple had to repay some taxes, the money would come as a windfall to Irish state coffers.

However, fearful of losing its reputation as a business-friendly country with low corporate taxes, the Irish government is adamant that no EU rules have been breached.

Scrutiny over corporate tax avoidance has risen to the top of the political agenda in the United States and Europe in recent years. 

Apple employs 4,000 people at a manufacturing plant in Cork, south-west Ireland, its only such facility outside of the United States.

Apple paid an average tax rate of just 2.5 percent on around $109 billion of non-U.S. profits in the past five years - a fraction of Ireland's 12.5 percent tax rate.
