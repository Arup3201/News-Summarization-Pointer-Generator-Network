A three-year-old heart patient died following a major delay in getting a key hospital appointment because of a glitch with a new NHS computer booking system, an inquest has heard.

Samuel Starr was born with a congenital cardiac defect, but underwent surgery not long after his birth and made a good recovery.

Medics treating the little boy said he would still need regular tests to check on his progress but Flax Bourton Coroner’s Court heard that Samuel did not have a crucial scan for 20 months after his first major operation.

Samuel Starr, three, died after a computer glitch meant he did not have a check-up for 20 months. He was born with a heart condition and underwent surgery when he was nine months old

It also heard that the delay came after a new computer booking system called Cerner Millennium was rolled out.

Once
 an appointment had been made and a detailed check-up was carried out, 
doctors found Samuel needed open heart surgery. During that procedure he
 suffered a stroke.

Further 
complications then followed and and he died in the arms of his parents 
Catherine Holley and Paul Starr at Bristol’s Children’s Hospital a few 
weeks later.

A tearful Ms 
Holley told the inquest she expected her son to get a check-up in early 
2011 - but said she was left feeling 'dejected' and 'alarmed' when the 
appointment did not go ahead until the summer of 2012.

She told the inquest of the moment she kissed her son goodbye.

She said: 'He was a kind and gentle boy with a great understanding of the world.

'As we read Samuel his favourite stories, he died in our arms.'

Samuel was born with a restricted pulmonary artery - causing blood to easily flow away from his heart to his lungs.

Samuel had an operation at Bristol Royal Hospital for Children and he was recovering well initially. However, his heart then began to struggle but this was not picked up because he went for so long without a check-up

Ms
 Holley said the condition was picked up during her 20 week scan. He was
 born 39 weeks into her pregnancy, on June 15, 2009 weighing 8Ibs.

But despite his heart problem Ms Holley said her child continued to flourish, and had required little medical intervention.

His parents were also told to expect for their son to undergo around three operations by the time he was aged five.

On March 3, 2010, Samuel had his first surgical procedure - open heart surgery at Bristol Royal Hospital for Children.

He
 was discharged six days later, and referred to the Paediatric Cardiac 
Clinic at the Royal United Hospital (RUH) in Bath for check-ups.

The
 inquest heard the first of these took place in Bristol in October 2010,
 and an echocardiogram, also known as an 'echo', was carried out.

Ms Holley said she was told the procedure would next be carried out early into the new year.

She added: 'We left the hospital comfortable knowing this information.'

However,
 at the next appointment, which took place in Bath the following April, 
Ms Holley said she was 'surprised that no echo' was undertaken.

The
 doctor told Samuel’s parents he hadn’t expected to see the youngster 
and swiftly moved them on without performing an echo scan.

But despite expecting to return six months later as instructed, they were not given an appointment until 14 months later.

He underwent surgery at Bristol Children’s Hospital on August 7, 2012.

Distraught
 Ms Holley said she begged a district nurse to help but she still 
struggled to get vital appointments at the Royal United Hospital in 
Bath.

Reading
 a statement, she said: 'We were expecting an appointment in the New 
Year (2011) - something we took to mean January - but we still hadn’t 
received one by March.

'We 
got Claire, our community nurse, to call the hospital. She called them 
on the 12th March, 20th March, 8th May, 28th May and the 29th May.

'We were then given an appointment for 14th June but we already had commitments then so it was rescheduled for 21st June.

Samuel was due to have his check ups at Royal United Hospital, Bath, but they became sporadic. A report has suggested a new computer-based patient booking system introduced at the RUH in 2011 was to blame

By the time Samuel's failing health was diagnosed he was very weak and he had to have more heart surgery. He died a month later following complications. An inquest into his death is due to open at Flax Burton Coroner's Court (pictured) on Monday

'When we got there Dr Tometzki said that he had expected to see us a lot earlier than this.

'After doing an echo scan he told us he didn’t want to shock us but he wanted Samuel to have heart surgery that spring.

'We were shocked, we hadn’t been expecting this. It wasn’t meant to happen.'

Samuel had a cardiac catheter inserted in July, before undergoing surgery in August.

'Just
 hours before his operation Samuel was dancing around the ward and 
telling the nurses all about Spiderman - we had to remind him to quieten
 down,' Ms Holley said.

'Many
 of the nurses on the ward could not believe how energetic he was 
considering the surgery he was about to have - he was a happy and 
healthy boy.

'After the operation, on August 9, as they began bringing Samuel out of sedation his left arm started flailing.

'We were (later) told Samuel had had a stroke and several cardiac arrests.'

His
 condition continued to deteriorate and on September 6, his parents were
 recommended for treatment to be withdrawn following the onset of a 
second cardiac arrest.

Experienced medic Dr Tometzki broke down in tears as he recalled that moment during his evidence.'It is not ideal to take a child off (life support).....but it was the right decision'.

Dr
 Tometzki said the decision to operate had been prompted after the 
discovery that Samuel's heart valves had thickened and become blocked.

'Had I seen this in January I would have gone ahead with the same treatment.

'Would it have made a difference? Logically the earlier you catch something then the result might be better.

'But I have no evidence in this case when you are looking at a patient with this condition.

'Yes I would have seen the obstruction (earlier), but I can't say whether that would have changed the outcome entirely.'

Samuel's cause of death was given as complex congenital heart disease and said to be 'multifactorial'.

Among the four main findings in his post mortem included sepsis (infection) and clotting abnormalities.

The inquest continues.
