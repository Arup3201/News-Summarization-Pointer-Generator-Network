68-year-old Pierre-Paul Thomas was born blind and would have continued to live without vision if he hadn't fallen down his stairs two years ago.  

The fall sent him to the hospital for fractures around his eye sockets and when treating his injuries a surgeon for the first time realized his blindness was curable.

Thomas was born with congenital nystagmus, a condition that made his eyes move side to side involuntary and had damaged optic nerves and cataracts on top of that.

He had resigned himself to the fact that he would never be able to see.

'It's bad luck but that's how it is,' he told the Montreal Gazette.

But then he fell down a set of stairs in his Montreal apartment two years ago, and it may have been the best thing to ever happen to him.

The fall required surgery on Thomas's face, where the thin bones around his eye sockets fractured.

While consulting with a plastic surgeon, she asked nonchalantly: 'Oh, while we're at it, do you want us to fix your eyes, too?'

Thomas was shocked. he didn't think it was possible.

But he grew up in the 1940s before free health care and the advancement of eye surgery.

According to Dr Dev Cheema, head of the ophthalmology clinic at Montreal General Hospital, it was the cataracts that caused Thomas to be legally blind - and not the disease. All they had to do was remove the cataracts.

'It feels great to do something like this. There's always a positive story to tell when it comes to ophthalmology,' he said.

With the repair of his vision, Thomas said he feels like a child all over again.

While visiting his sister Giselle in Ahuntsic, Canada, he witnessed flowers and trees blooming for the first time.

'I find everything beautiful,' he said. 'Faces, skin - I find it all beautiful.'

Thomas' new found vision has caused a few problems though, as he has to learn everything over again as if he were a child.

When he went to the corner store with his sister, he handed the cashier a $10 bill when he really should have handed a $5 bill.

Colors still confuse him, and the first time he stepped out onto his sixth-floor balcony, the drop down gave him vertigo.

The idea of remembering things visually is hard as well, and he still resorts to touching and feeling the world around him to store those memories.

But overall, Thomas is happy now that he has the ability to see.

'Before this everything way grey,' he said.
