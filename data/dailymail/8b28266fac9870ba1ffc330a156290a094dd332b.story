The deconstruction of a mountain villa built on the roof of a Beijing skyscraper has finished one year after it was ordered to be demolished.

The 8,610-square foot structure used rocks and greenery to recreate the illusion of an incredible natural mountainside, but angered residents who were living in fear below it.

They claimed it was unsafe and caused cracks to appear in ceilings and walls, while some had to battle with leaks from broken pipes and drains.

When it was finished, the villa boasted dining halls, a gym, a karaoke bar, guest rooms and a swimming pool

The indulgent villa was perched atop a 26-storey building in Beijing, China, and featured several dining halls, a gym, a karaoke bar, guest rooms and an open-air swimming pool.

Owner Zhang Biqing, who made his fortune in traditional Chinese medicine, recently invited a group of reporters to survey what remained of the once-sprawling villa.

The property made headlines last year for what - at a distance - looked like a pile of rocks dotted with trees on top of the apartment building.

Neighbours had complained about the villa, saying they feared it could collapse on top of them.

The demolition has finally been completed a year after it was first ordered to be deconstructed

The rocks used for the building's exterior were said to be made of imitation shells, rather than stone, and had trees and shrubs growing from them as seen in classical Chinese landscaping painting

The rooftop home, which never received planning approval, caused cracks to appear in neighbours' ceilings and walls while some had to put up with leaks from broken pipes and drains.

Neighbours were also forced to live with the noise and disturbance caused from the building work.

One resident said their apartment was constantly flooded while another described the owner as a 'menace'.

The rocks used in the villa were said to be imitation shells rather than solid stone, and had trees and bushes growing among them as in classical Chinese landscape painting.
