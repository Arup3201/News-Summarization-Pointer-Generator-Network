Jermain Defoe was in Toronto International Airport the last time he had a conversation with Roy Hodgson.

That was in May, and the Three Lions boss was ringing to tell the Toronto FC striker he would not be going to the World Cup.

Defoe might well have been tempted to jump on a flight back to London, rather than the plane he was about to board for a Canadian Championship match in Vancouver.

Jermain Defoe has set his sights on a recall to the England squad following his move to Sunderland 

Defoe made his Sunderland debut in their 2-1 defeat at former side Tottenham on Saturday

For that was the point at which Defoe – already missing home and the Premier League – realised that his MLS move had been a case of misadventure.

‘I was devastated,’ said the new Sunderland frontman, recalling the moment Hodgson delivered the news.

‘I was involved in every squad. If I’m honest, I thought I was going. When I got the phone call it was hard.

‘At the back of my mind I thought the main reason was because I’d left the Premier League.

Defoe has scored 19 goals from 55 appearances for his country but was left out of the World Cup squad

Roy Hodgson has not spoken to Defoe since breaking the bad news to the striker in May last year

‘I think the manager looked at that and thought there are players in the Premier League who are performing there and deserve to go more than me, whereas I was in another country.

‘But even before that I always thought, “I miss the Premier League”.’

Defoe has not spoken to Hodgson since and won’t be calling the England manager any time soon, preferring to do his talking on the pitch as he bids for a recall.

‘I don't think I need to speak to him,’ said the 32-year-old, who has 19 goals from 55 appearances for his country. ‘What am I meant to say to him? Why?

Defoe joined the Black Cats on a three-and-a-half year deal from MLS side Toronto FC earlier this month

‘I had the conversation when I wasn't included. He said it was because he wanted to go with a lot of the younger players who had done well.

‘It was as simple as that. At the end of the day, Roy knows what he gets from me. He can look at my England record.’

There was speculation that Defoe could retire from international football in the wake of his World Cup snub.

But that was never a consideration for the player, who instead believes his goals for Sunderland can win back his place in the England set-up.

Defoe faced the media up in the north east during a press conference on Tuesday

‘I still think I've got a lot to offer,’ he said. ‘I still feel sharp. I've always worked hard and I still feel like I've got a lot of goals left in me.

‘Yes, I was disappointed and upset, but at the same time I still want to play for my country. I still want to score goals for England.

‘If I’m scoring goals, I’d like to think I’ll get the opportunity to do that again.’

Defoe, meanwhile, refuses to criticise MLS or Toronto, but does admit to being taken aback by the culture of the league.

‘One of the strangest things was the reporters in the locker room,’ he said.

Defoe says he joined Sunderland because a return to the Premier League proved too tempting

The striker turned his back on the MLS outfit after just 12 months at Toronto

‘I used to forget and just come out of the shower and I would be like, “woah”.

‘I was sat there and surrounded by journalists and I had just got out the shower. I had never experienced anything like that before.

‘There was also a lot of travelling. My first game was five hours away against Seattle and that was one of the closer ones.

‘I came out on a red carpet and there were fireworks. I was like “wow, this is a bit different”.’

In the end, it was the differences which persuaded Defoe to come back to what he knows. He will be hoping Hodgson, too, turns to a familiar face when he names his next England squad.
