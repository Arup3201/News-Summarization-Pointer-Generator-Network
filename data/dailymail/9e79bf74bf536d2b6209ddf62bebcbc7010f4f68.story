Manchester City hope Sergio Aguero will sign his new £210,000-a-week deal before the start of the new season.

The Premier League champions have made it clear to the Argentina striker that he is pivotal to their future, along with captain Vincent Kompany, and talks have gone well. 

Real Madrid and Barcelona have made no secret of their admiration for Aguero, 26, but City want to wrap up a new improved five-year deal overtaking the current one which runs to 2017.

Aguero was dogged by niggling injuries last season, but still scored 28 goals in 34 games.

City have opened initial talks with Kompany over a similar sized deal and hope Edin Dzeko, Joe Hart and James Milner follow suit.

Milner, 28, wants to wait to see how many games he gets before renewing, but is key to City’s homegrown quota.
