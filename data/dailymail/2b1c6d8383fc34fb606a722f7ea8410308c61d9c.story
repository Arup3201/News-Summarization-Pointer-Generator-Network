A nurse has been sacked from a hospital after she was seen taking money from a patient's wallet - by a relative who was watching on the other side of the world on Skype.

New dad Nick and his wife, Chrysa, were on a Skype call to family in Greece when they stepped away briefly to check on their baby in the nursery at Melbourne's Epworth hospital.

Their family waited on the line, watching the live feed of the new parents' empty hospital room.

A female nurse was sacked from her job at Epworth Hospital in Victoria after being spotted on Skype stealing $20 from a patient's room

'My husband came back first and his dad asked him "where's your jacket and your wallet?" because, he said, a lady came into the room,' the new mum told Fairfax Radio on Tuesday.

'She went to the chair - and my husband's jacket was there - she took the wallet, opened it and she took something.'

The same nurse later visited the room as part of her duties.

'My father-in-law was still on Skype he confirmed that it was that person,' Chrysa said.

An Epworth Hospital spokesperson said that theft in hospitals was a rising problem and the facility would now introduce security cameras in public areas to try and deter theft from patients

'It wasn't much, it was only $20 but that is not right from a nurse.'

'We're very upset, we don't know why the lady did that, myabe she had problems?' Chrysa told Nine News. 

A hospital spokesperson said a nurse was dismissed for theft and she was required to hand the cash and a written apology to the family.

'Epworth confirms that a staff member was identified a few weeks ago on Skype stealing money from a patient's room,' Epworth media manager Colleen Coghlan said.

'Epworth took swift action and the staff member left Epworth's employment immediately.'

Chrysa told ABC Radio that she wished that the nurse would not lose her job but did not want the same thing to happen to others.

Chrysa said she was upset by the theft and said maybe the woman was struggling financially 

Alan Kinkade, Epworth Health CEO, described the situation as awful, and said he believes other staff would be horrified by the incident 

Mrs Coghlan said theft in hospitals was a rising problem and Epworth would introduce security cameras to public areas to deter theft from patients' rooms.

'The issue for public and private hospitals has been identifying the perpetrator,' she said.

'I'm shocked. I think it was a horrible experience for the patient concerned and it's not something that anybody expects to happen when they come in to be cared for in a hospital.'

Alan Kinkade, Epworth Health CEO echoed this when speaking to Nine News.

'It's awful, awful. I think for our other 5000 staff they would be horrified that this has occurred.' he said.
