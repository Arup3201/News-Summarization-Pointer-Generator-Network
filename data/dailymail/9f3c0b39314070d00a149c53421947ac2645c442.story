Wolf Hall star Mark Rylance claims he has to edit Shakespeare plays to remove 'antisemitic' lines.

The British actor and former artistic director at the Globe Theatre in London said he feels compelled to cut certain parts which have taken on more 'resonance' since the Holocaust.

Rylance, who plays Thomas Cromwell in the hit BBC drama, was speaking at the Globe where he unveiled a copy of Shakespeare's first folio -  recently found in France.

Wolf Hall star Mark Rylance claims he has to edit Shakespeare plays to remove 'antisemitic' lines. He was speaking at the Globe Theatre where he unveiled a copy of Shakespeare's first folio (above),

He said: 'I don't think there's pressure (to remove) the bawdy jokes. He's bawdier a lot more times than people realise.

'The pressures I feel are more for times where he will say something very antisemitic.

'I have to make the decision, do I include that or not. There are some very unfortunate antisemitic things that characters say.

'If a character says it, it doesn't mean the author means it but since the holocaust... these statements have a lot more resonance now than they did at that time.'

Rylance, 55, added: 'Mostly you edit the plays because they're too long and boring. I think they were edited at the time.

'From what I know of talking to scholars, our own practices are not different from what they did at the time.

'If you went out and played in a puritan town in the north of England, you took out some of the things that were going to offend those people.'

He said actors would be 'chased out of town' if they did not censor their own plays.

'Players have always adjusted the words to get on with the powers that be,' he added. 

Professor John Jowett of The Shakespeare Institute at the University of Birmingham said: 'Anti-Semitism is a fact of the early modern culture in which Shakespeare lived, worked, and thought, and he was not exempt from it.

'Critics have often remarked on his sensitive and to some extent sympathetic presentation of Shylock, but there is always an element of special pleading. 

Many point towards Shakespeare's character of Shylock in The Merchant of Venice as a symbol of the antisemitic feeling present in Elizabethan England at the time.

Shylock is a Jewish moneylender who grants a loan to his Christian rival Antonio.

When Antonio defaults on the loan, Shylock demands a pound of flesh as payment - as was previously agreed.

One interpretation of the play is that Shakespeare meant to contrast the mercy of the main Christian characters with the vengeful Shylock, who lacks the religious grace to show mercy.

Similarly, some highlight  Shylock's forced conversion to Christianity as Shakespeare intending a 'happy ending' for the character - redeeming him from his unbelief and his specific sin of wanting to kill Antonio.

However critics also remark on the sensitive and sympathetic presentation of the Jewish character.

'Mark Rylance is absolutely right to note the sharply anti-Semitic 'resonance' that some of the lines Shakespeare gives his characters have today. 

'Directors face difficult decisions in this respect. They should be free to act without fear, irrespective of whether their decision is to play the text fully or soften its edges to avoid giving offence. 

'It's useful when they tell the public what they've done, and so I welcome Rylance's openness.'

Mark Rylance was artistic director at the Globe Theatre for ten years from 1995 to 2005, directing and acting in notable productions of Twelfth Night and Richard II. 

He spoke today at the unveiling of The Saint Omer folio.

The folio was found in November in a library in the French town of Saint Omer - where it had lain undiscovered for nearly 200 years.

The value of the folio is estimated at £3 million to £6 million, according to Remy Cordonnier, who uncovered it in the library in Saint Omer.

It will be exhibited at the Globe in 2016, the year of the 400th anniversary Shakespeare's death. 

There are only around 230 copies of the folio in existence, experts say.

During today's interview, Rylance, who has won three Tony awards for his roles in Shakespeare plays, added that he was 'not a big fan' of making young people read the.

He said: 'I'm not a big fan of young people being forced to read Shakespeare.

'His chosen art form was theatre. It's not a thing that relies on whether you can read or not.

'The plays were written to be heard and I think taking young people to read them and then answer tests about them is really disrespectful to the author.

'If you like reading them, great. I prefer to hear them and have them acted out. I can't understand them apart from when I read them, until I get up and play them, or hear some good actors playing them because they are expressions of emotions and feelings.

'If you read them drily, unless you imagine that stuff, or are good at imagining that stuff, they cannot make sense

'But when you hear them and see them acted out in front of you or you act them out yourself, which is what I did as a child, then you really get into the value of them.

'So I'm a little bit sceptical about young people being forced to read them. If they want to, great, but I think that's the last thing the author intended.'
