Mario Gomez is itching for an international recall with Germany after missing their World Cup win through a long-standing injury.

The 29-year-old, with 59 caps and 25 goals to his name, last featured for Germany more than a year ago in a 3-3 draw against Paraguay.

'I obviously want and I will come back to the national team,' Gomez told Sport Bild magazine. 'The pre-season preparation went well and we are well prepared for the start of the (Italian) season.'

Relax: Gomez will hope to break into the Germany squad after missing the World Cup-winning party in Brazil

Resting: Gomez has been on the sidelines but is ready to work hard to earn an international recall for Germany

A promising start to life after Bayern Munich at Fiorentina was cut short by a knee ligament injury in September last year that kept him sidelined for months. 

It led the striker to label last season 'the ugliest of his career'. 

It got worse as a further injury upon his comeback saw Gomez miss the selection for the Germany squad that went on to win the World Cup in Brazil. 

In his absence,  Miroslav Klose took on the responsibility as Germany's sole forward. The striker has now retired internationally, adding to the likelihood of a Gomez return. 

Germany manager Joachim Low will imminently name his squad for their friendly against World Cup finalists Argentina on September 3 and their first Euro 2016 qualifier against Scotland four days later.
