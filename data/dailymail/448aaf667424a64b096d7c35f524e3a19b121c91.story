Another year, another Eurogamer. But where only hints of next-gen gaming blessed last year's meeting, this year, the Playstation 4 and Xbox One took centre stage.

And generally, both fared very well. Earlier in the year, Daily Mail Games reported that PS4 exclusive Drive Club looked extremely rough around the edges - even being eclipsed in the visual department by current-gen racer, Gran Turismo 6.

Out of first gear: at this year's Eurogamer, Drive Club looked far more impressive than the E3 demo

But what a difference a few months make. Dive Club is noticeably sharper, and car models have been given a much-needed spit and polish. Environments are no longer plagued with pop-up, and there's now a subtle motion blur, giving the racer a next-gen sheen.

Still, Microsoft's Xbox One exclusive, Forza 5, raced ahead of the pack with regards to graphics. Pixel-perfect cars and dynamic lighting make this one of the best-looking racers yet. Critics may have noticed some of the environments looking slightly bland, but the demo is far from representative of the final game.

Stunning: Forza 5 boasted the best visuals of any racer at the event, closely followed by Need For Speed Rivals

Need For Speed Rivals added a much-needed dash of arcade racing to the mix, while The Crew's intriguing multiplayer mechanism is sure to win over fans. Here, players have to work together in a pack of modified super cars to complete objectives - such as ramming a target vehicle off the road.

Up close, The Crew's visuals still look slightly raw, but it's hugely impressive in motion - with Burnout-style slow-motion takedowns and intricately-detailed car models.

Dark Knight rises: Origins explores a much younger Batman and his animation and fighting style reflects that

Away from the racing scene, and Batman: Arkham Origins was unveiled in all of its glory. It's extremely similar to the last two games - which may leave some fans wanting more. What is noticeable, however, is Batman's movement. 

He's younger in Origins and so is more agile and graceful than the blunt, heavy-handed hero we've played in the last two games.

Being a current-gen game in a sea of next-gen offerings is always hard, but Origins still looked impressive. The sense of scale and the realisation of a snow-covered Gotham create the most visually-striking backdrop yet.

Silky smooth: New Order was a masterclass in gaming, boasting a consistent framerate and great visuals

Although queues stretched long and far for Battlefield 4, Call of Duty Ghosts and Titanfall, it was Wolfenstein: New Order that really stood out for us. Running on middle-powered PCs, the visuals still looked breathtaking.

Shooting mechanics were incredibly responsive, as were death animations, while a clever lean function emphasises the need to rely on cover (to let health regenerate) and not just running in.

Lighting up next year: Dying Light is looking like a much more dynamic version of Dead Island. The free-running component is inspired, too. It's set for release next year

Dying Light, too, a mix of Mirror's Edge and Dead Island was incredibly impressive, too. You play a survivor who must scavenge for weapons and food and must use free-running to escape hordes of zombies.

During the day, they are slow and clumsy, but at night they change into frenzied, merciless animals. Boasting dynamic lighting, photo-realistic textures and  next-gen motion blur and draw distance, it looks to be the most impressive, open-world zombie game ever created.

On this evidence, the future's bright for gamers.
