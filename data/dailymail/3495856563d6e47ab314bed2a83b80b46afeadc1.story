Leicester City have signed Stoke City defender Robert Huth on a loan deal until the end of the season. 

Huth arrived at Leicester's training ground on Friday morning and trained with his new team-mates before finalising the deal. 

He becomes Nigel Pearson's third signing of the window, following goalkeeper Mark Schwarzer and striker Andrej Kramaric.

 Huth was recently in trouble with the FA for sending explicit tweets, and was handed a two-game ban

Pearson is desperate for defensive reinforcements as he plots to keep his ailing team in the Premier League and sees Stoke's Huth as the ideal man to shore up his defence. 

Huth has been restricted to just four appearances this season under Mark Hughes - two in the Capital One Cup, once in the FA Cup and only one Premier League game. 

Stoke City and Leicester City had to renegotiate the terms of Huth's loan after he was given a two-match ban by the FA instead of a one-game suspension anticipated by the clubs for an explicit tweet he sent out.

Huth had responded to a Twitter account - named 'C**k or no c**k' - which posts sexual images of individuals and asks users to guess their gender.

The longer punishment meant Huth is available to Leicester for one fewer game, hence a reduction in the loan fee was discussed, but talks were successful.
