New curbs on Muslim veils in the Commons were criticised by Respect MP George Galloway last night, writes Simon Walters.

Mr Galloway, whose Bradford West constituency has a large ethnic population, said the restrictions could discriminate against Muslim women.

The rule for everyone who works at the Palace of Westminster states: ‘You may be required to remove any covering which obscures your face.’

Mr Galloway said: ‘Everyone understands the need to have proper security.

'But these rules seem a little heavy handed and confusing to me.

We live in a multi-faith society and need to be sensitive about that.’

But one MP said it would be better for visitors: ‘It will be much more welcoming for them if they are greeted by someone whose face they can see clearly.’
