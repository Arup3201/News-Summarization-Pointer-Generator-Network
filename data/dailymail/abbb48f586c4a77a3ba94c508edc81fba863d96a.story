Thirteen children and a teacher have been injured by electric shocks after metal door handles and a fence became live at their primary school.

Witnesses said the deputy headteacher at Briercliffe Primary in Burnley, Lancashire, was 'blown backwards' in one incident, suffering burns to her hands and arms.

Mrs Addy was apparently hurt  after she opened the door leading to the playground while parents said their children suffered shocks from the fencing.

MailOnline understands that in 'significant' parts of the school every metal object was live.

Danger: Children and a teacher have been hurt after getting electric shocks off metal objects in their Lancashire primary school

Victim: Destiny Goodwin, pictured with her mother and father, said she felt a 'buzzing' up her arm after she touched the fence

Electricity North West said today they are investigating. There was a power cut in the area yesterday morning and engineers had been working on a fault at the school before the problems.

The teacher and the thirteen children, aged between seven and 11, were hurt at around 1pm. 

Mrs Addy and five children were taken to Blackburn Infirmary while eight more pupils were treated at the scene.

Parents said they had rushed to the school yesterday after students were evacuated. They were taken to shaded areas and given cold drinks until parents arrived.

Destiny Goodwin, 10, a pupil in Year 6 was given a shock after touching the fencing said: 'You would touch the metal fencing in the playground and it would give you an electric shock. When you touched it you couldn’t let go straightaway.'

Her mother Zoe added: “All the kids were touching the fencing at lunch time. Destiny said it was like a buzzing up her arm. I’m just upset. They’ve been sat in the shade under the trees.

'I’m not happy at all. The school has not been shut and parents didn’t find out anything.'

Problems: North West Electricity said it is investigating after metal objects in significant parts of the school became live 

Many parents said they had found out only when they picked up their children and saw the commotion.

They said they had been left confused and angry that they had not been notified.

One angry parent, who refused to be named, said: 'You don't send your child to school and expect something like this to happen. 

One said that she had only found out after her sister in Spain text her asking what was happening at her grandson’s school.

She added: 'My sister text me from Spain asking what was going on. We didn’t have a clue. someone said that the children involved had been taken to hospital and are fine and others are being checked out here. Someone said that the teacher touched it and it blew her backwards.'

Another parent whose son Kai is a pupil at the school and in Year described it as 'chaos'.

She said: 'I just found out about it now on Facebook, it’s disgusting. The head teacher wouldn’t tell us which class or which children. We didn’t know whether they had been electrocuted or not. The parents are all fuming because we have not been informed. We should not have to see it on Facebook. 

'We turn up at the school and ambulances are here, it’s your worst nightmare, we don’t know what’s going on it’s disorganised and they won’t let us past. We’ve been told not to touch any metal. The kids must be scared to death.'   

Concerns: Parents with children at Briercliff Primary said that the teacher was 'blown backwards' after touching a live object

As the children were finally let out of the school grounds around 4pm children could be overheard saying that children were left upset and some were crying from the shocks.

Rob Blanchet, headteacher at Briercliffe Primary School, said: 'Earlier today, ten children and a teacher received an electric shock. The teacher has been taken to hospital and the children, who are between the age of 7 and 11, are being treated on site by paramedics.

'It is too early to say exactly what happened. The cause of the problem is currently being investigated by the electricity company.

'The school is closed at the moment until the site has been made safe. As things stand, we don’t know whether we will be able to open the school tomorrow.

'We are receiving support from safety experts and colleagues from Lancashire County Council and other organisations.'
