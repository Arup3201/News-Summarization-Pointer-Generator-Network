A 25-year-old woman attacked another woman at a barbecue in Washington state because she thought her shorts were too short.

Alica Rae Hanson of Snohomish is accused of confronting the other woman at a party on June 22, first complaining about her attire and then several minutes later attacking her and knocking her to the ground.

Hanson was charged with felony second-degree assault, according to papers filed in Snohomish County Superior Court last week.

The prosecutor wrote that the defendant confronted the woman about her shorts, 'claiming that they were too short for the BBQ party and acting in an aggressive manner.'

Several minutes later, Hanson allegedly ran up to the woman and knocked her to the ground with a punch. She was jumped upon her victim, repeatedly hitting her even pulling out hair.

When police arrived, they found the shaken victim, bloody with her left eye swollen shut, reports The Daily Herald.

They also spotted 'a pile of blond hair extensions on a table,' which had been pulled from the victim's head.

The victim suffered broken facial bones and bleeding in the left eye.

Hanson has no criminal history, according to prosecutors
