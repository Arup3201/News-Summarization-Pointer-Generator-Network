Two council employees were killed on their bicycles after they were hit by a car which was apparently being chased by police.

The men were named locally as father-of-two and bin lorry driver John Morland, 29, and father-of-five and waste management employee Kris Jarvis, 39.

Both men died at the scene last night in the flood-hit village of Purley-on-Thames, Berkshire.

Death: The first victim was named locally as father-of-two John Morland (pictured with his wife Hayley)

Tragic: The second cyclist also worked at Reading Borough Council and was named locally as Kris Jarvis, pictured

Speeding: The BMW collided with two cyclists on the A329 . Mr Morland (pictured) was named locally as the younger victim. Both worked for Reading Borough Council

Police were called at 9pm to a 'fear-for-welfare' incident involving a black BMW convertible.

It is believed officers gave chase to the vehicle on the A329 before it crashed and hit the two cyclists.

The
 31-year-old driver of the BMW, from Purley-on-Thames, was cut out of 
the car and taken to hospital, where he was treated for minor injuries 
before being arrested on suspicion of causing death by dangerous 
driving. He remains in custody.

The Independent Police Complaints Commission (IPCC) is carrying out an assessment of the incident.

Mr Morland's mother-in-law, who gave her name only as Janet, left a bouquet of red and white flowers at the scene.

She said her daughter was too upset to speak. 'My daughter's in bits and the children too,' she added.

Poignant: A black bike saddle was left by the side of the road today. It is unclear if it was linked to the incident

Bollards: The two cyclists were killed on impact with the black convertible

A spokesman for Thames Valley Police 
said: 'The BMW, which was travelling on the A329 Purley Rise, 
subsequently collided with two cyclists, who both died at the scene.'

Reading Borough Council confirmed the two victims were employees.

Spokesman
 Oscar Mortali said: 'It is with great sadness that news of the tragic 
death of two council employees reached us this morning.

'The thoughts of everyone at Reading Borough Council are obviously with their families at this sad time.'

Leigh Bracher, 36, watched in horror through her window as police, fire engines and ambulances arrived at the scene.

She
 said: 'All we heard was the crash and when we looked out the car was 
just outside my neighbour's drive and police were there already.

'We
 could heard them cutting him out of the car. He was moaning and 
screaming, he was obviously in a lot of pain, but all I could see was an
 expensive gold watch.

'The car was carnage. The bonnet was half open and the front and back ends were crushed.'

Another
 resident said he saw a big flash of light and when he looked out, he 
saw two bodies lying on the ground outside his house.

The man, who did not want to be named, said: 'I've been told it was a police chase.

'The
 car rolled over and ended up outside the house and someone was being 
cut out of it. I didn't do anything as the police were already here.

Scene: The cyclists were hit by a car on the Purley Rise junction of the A329, pictured

'The man added that it was an "accident blackspot" with many crashes at the scene before.'

A
 bent signpost and two traffic bollards could be seen at the side of the
 road where the accident happened, with displaced earth underneath it.

A bicycle seat and other debris could be seen in bushes to the side of the road, which has a 30mph speed limit.

The two men have not yet been formally named by the authorities.

Assistant
 Chief Constable of Thames Valley Police Richard Bennett said: 'There is a significant amount 
of work ongoing with regards to the investigation and so it is difficult
 to give any further details at the moment.

'Our
 thoughts and sympathies at this time are with the two families who have
 been left absolutely devastated by the loss of their loved ones.'

Purley-on-Thames is one of the areas worst hit by the flooding in the Thames Valley.

Village: Two cyclists died last night after being hit by a car in Purley on Thames, Berkshire

Flooded: Ed Miliband visited the village on Tuesday to examine the damage done by the floods there

Labour
 leader Ed Miliband visited the village earlier this week and urged the 
government to put pressure on insurance companies so flood victims do 
not have to wait for payouts.

Bill
 Ayling, a long-serving councillor on Purley-on-Thames Parish Council, 
said the road where the incident happened is on a hill and would not 
have been flood-affected.

He
 said: 'I'm absolutely shocked. I know the road very well. It is well 
lit at night and it's up on a hill, so I know it would not be flooded up
 there.'

Parish council chairman Rick Jones added: 'Reading is nearby and car crime is a normal occurrence in areas like that.

'I
 do know of cars being stolen and police chasing them, and that road 
where the incident happened lends itself to cars travelling fast.

Location: The crash took place in the Thames Valley, which has been badly hit by flooding

'It's a shock. It's a very quiet village normally.'

Purley Rise, between the junctions of Westbury Lane and Sherwood Rise, reopened about 10 hours after the crash, police said.

An IPCC spokesman said: 'We sent investigators to the scene and we are carrying out an assessment.

'Our people on the ground are looking into the circumstances and in time will decide the level of IPCC involvement.'

Anyone who witnessed the collision or saw the BMW beforehand is asked to contact police on 101 or Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111.
