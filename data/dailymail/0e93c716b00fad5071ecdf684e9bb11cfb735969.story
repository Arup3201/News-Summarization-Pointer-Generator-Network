She's the reality TV star who is rarely seen looking anything but polished and glamorous.

And Kim Kardashian is so passionate about make-up that she and her sisters have just launched their own beauty range.

Despite all this, her boyfriend Kanye West is actually a fan of the low maintenance look and prefers Kim - who has famously revealed the work that goes into her beauty routine - without a scrap of make-up.

Revelation: Kim Kardashian has revealed in an interview that rapper beau Kanye West actually prefers her more natural look

The Keeping Up With The Kardashians star revealed 36-year-old Kanye's preference for her bare-faced look in an interview with Feelunique.com.

She said: 'He loves the dress up aspect, but he also likes me without make-up on.'

And it seems that Kim is taking a more relaxed approach to her beauty regime because of this.

A source told Us Weekly that she hasn't worn any make-up since the arrival of her daughter four weeks ago.

'She has always had a schedule with every hour of the day taken,'

'Now, she hasn’t had her hair or make-up done since she had the baby,' said the insider.

How he likes her: Whilst Kim said that Kanye likes it when she dresses up (R) he loves her without make-up (L) and a source has revealed that she hasn't even worn any make-up since the birth of her daughter a month ago

But the oh-so-polished Kim, 32, revealed that, like every other woman, she has suffered many make-up and fashion disasters in her time.

She cites matching eye shadow to her hair accessories and clothes as the worst of her make-up faux pas.

But thanks to years of practice it seems that Kim knows what she's doing. A number of the beauty products from her new line sold out within a matter of hours on beauty e-tailer Feelunique when they went on sale on Monday, with some fans being put on a waiting list for some sold-out products.

Hot on the heels of their fast fashion collaboration with Dorothy Perkins Kim, Khloe and Kourtney created their affordable cosmetics line designed to inject a bit of Los Angeles into the everyday.
