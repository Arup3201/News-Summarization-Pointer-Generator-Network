The Greek Football Association have offered young Celtic fan Jay Beatty the trip of a lifetime to see his hero Georgios Samaras in action at the World Cup.

Beatty, who was carried around the pitch by Samaras on Celtic's end-of-season lap of honour, will get a chance to see the Greek striker when they take on Costa Rica in the last 16 on Sunday.

The young fan was also handed a league winner's medal by manager Neil Lennon.

Opportunity: Beatty was offered the chance to see his hero Georgios Samaras in last-16 action

The 11-year-old, who has Down's syndrome, was described by Samaras as 'a friend and an inspiration'.

Beatty's dad received the call with the offer of a lifetime when about to take off for a holiday to USA.

Samaras added: 'This boy gives me so much strength, it’s incredible. There are no words. I feel his love so much. This love I feel, is also felt by many people in Greece. There’s a Facebook page for him to come to Brazil.'

'This morning, in a talk I had with the head of the EPO, we said we will arrange his tickets to come and watch the match with Costa Rica. Well will talk with the boy’s father, we’ll tell him about everything and we’ll see.'

Greece qualified for the last 16 with a last-gasp penalty to beat Ivory Coast 2-1 in their final Group C game and finish in second place behind Colombia.

In the second round, the Euro 2004 champions will play surprise Group D winners Costa Rica, who topped their division ahead of Uruguay, Italy and England.
