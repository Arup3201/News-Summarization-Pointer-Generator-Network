He has faced accusations of chillaxing ever since he was appointed – not least because of his tendency to fall asleep on the job.

But it seems Larry the Downing Street cat is at last taking his duties as Chief Mouser to the Cabinet seriously.

After a barren year he leapt into action yesterday, and was found sitting proudly alongside a dead mouse outside No 10.

Bring out the bunting: Larry is shown here outside No. 10 and to the far left you can see his victim lying on the small lawn

First kill: A year after arriving at Downing Street Larry is shown on the left just after pouncing on a mouse, which was then tossed on the grass, right,  just outside the Prime Minister's official residence 

It was believed to be his first  ‘confirmed kill’, with the prey itself as evidence.

Larry, five, was recruited last 
February to rid No 10 of its rodent problem, but swiftly earned a  
reputation for napping rather than ratting.

Until yesterday, when it appears he discovered his killer instinct.

Olly Grender, deputy director of 
communications at No 10, tweeted: ‘Just arrived at work. Larry the cat 
sitting proudly outside No 10 front door with a dead mouse next to him.’

She added: ‘Contrary to popular 
belief Larry is not a tart for the cameras and moved.’

While the other 
residents of Westminster still have weeks until the end of the summer 
recess, perhaps Larry has tired of the easy life.

In June, he was photographed soaking up the sunshine in the middle of Downing Street.

But he soon found himself hoisted up 
by a police protection officer and dumped unceremoniously by No 11, 
where David and Samantha Cameron live.

Larry, a rescue cat from Battersea 
Dogs and Cats Home, was hailed as a ‘good ratter’ and having ‘a high 
chase-drive and hunting instinct’ when he first arrived in Downing 
Street.

But his career has, until now, been 
less than successful. Indeed, last year a photographer caught him as he 
pounced for a mouse – and missed.

And he previously got into trouble by
 lingering outside the famous front door before the Prime Minister was 
due for a photo call, earning himself a gentle nudge inside courtesy of a
 policeman’s boot.

At least yesterday’s kill will make 
up for the disappointment he naturally felt after narrowly missing out 
on Celebrity Cat of the Year.

He was beaten to the top prize by cartoon character Simon’s Cat.

Long boot of the law: Lazy Larry paused
 too long for the policeman standing guard last year, who helped him on his way 
with a helpful boot up the backside

Taking it easy: Larry the Downing Street had more of a reputation for chillaxing outside on the pavement than catching mice - until now

Job done: Larry has earned his keep while David Cameron is on holiday in Cornwall, shown here stalking the corridors of power

Behind you! Last year Larry the Downing Street cat prepared to pounce as this mouse popped its head up - but he missed

Now where is it? Larry searched the gulley as the mouse ducks out of sight - but thankfully he has caught his first one
