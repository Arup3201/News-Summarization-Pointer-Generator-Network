It is a possibility his fans won’t even want to think about.

But Andy Murray says he has come to terms with the fact that he may not win Wimbledon - and claims he is now a better player because of it.

The Scottish tennis ace, 26, said yesterday that his failure to win the championship last year had taught him not to put too much pressure on himself.

Speaking on the eve of this year’s games at SW19, the world number two warned fans he could not guarantee a win - and that he was ‘comfortable’ with that.

He added that his new attitude would allow him to just ‘go out there and play’ - without worrying about letting anyone down.

He said yesterday: ‘It’s still an incredibly difficult tournament to win.

‘The players that are around right now are so good and so consistent that it’s going to be a tough tournament for me to win and I’ve thought about finishing my career and not winning Wimbledon and I’m comfortable with that.’

Last year, when he lost to Roger Federer, his devastation was plain to see on live television when he shed several tears on court.

Among the crestfallen crowd on the day were his girlfriend, Kim Sears, and the Duchess of Cambridge - both of whom were also crying.

After that disappointment, he went on to beat Federer and win gold at the London Olympics - and also became the champion of the US Open.

Yesterday, he admitted that he had been putting too much stress on himself at crucial parts of matches in the run-up to the Wimbledon final.

He told he told BBC5 Live’s Sportweek: ‘I can’t guarantee I’m going to win Wimbledon.

'I’m doing all I can to give myself the best possible chance. I work as hard as I can and as long as I give 110% on the court that’s the best that I can do.

‘After the Wimbledon final last year I accepted that there is a chance I may finish my career without a grand slam even though it’s something I was desperate to do.

‘I was starting to put way too much pressure on myself in the big matches and the important moments in those matches.

‘Once I became comfortable with those sort of thoughts I was able to just go out there and play.’

Yesterday, it was also revealed that Murray’s grandmother Shirley Erskine may miss him playing at Wimbledon.

The 79-year-old - and his No1 fan - has broken her hip and may be unable to take her seat on Centre Court to cheer him on.

Murray revealed that she was recovering from surgery after being taken to hospital following a fall at her home in Dunblane.

‘She was doing the bed and tripped on the electric blanket,’ he said. ‘I called and asked, why in this day and age, she was still using an electric blanket and she said, “It’s not me, it’s your grandfather!”'
