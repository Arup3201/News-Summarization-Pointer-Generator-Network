The adage 'time is money' has proven true for one Canadian man who has spent the last seven years and $100,000 fighting for, what he believes is, his rightful half of a $21.4 million lottery prize.

Joel Ifergan's seven-year battle against Loto-Quebec came to a disappointing end Thursday when the country's highest court ruled it wouldn't hear his case, according to The Globe and Mail. 

Ifergan, of Montreal, has been fighting for half of the May 23, 2008 Super 7 jackpot fortune after a computer delay caused his ticket to print seven seconds after the cutoff time.

Ticket: Ifergan picked the winning numbers. But Loto-Quebec rejected his ticket because it had the following week's draw date printed on the top as a result of the seven-second print delay

Ifergan picked the winning numbers for the jackpot of $21.4 million (27 million Canadian dollars). But Loto-Quebec rejected his ticket because it had the following week's draw date printed on the top as a result of the seven-second print delay, according to the Toronto Sun.

Ifergan sued the province's lottery regulator blaming the delay -- and the $21.4 million loss -- on the company's central computer system, according to ITV news. 

'The deadline that they advertise was for 9 p.m. –- which I did,' Ifergan told  CTV.

Ifergan said the seven-year battle has cost him more than $100,000 in legal fees. 

On that fateful May night, Ifergan made a last-minute decision to purchase two Super 7 Loto-Quebec lottery tickets during a stop at a convenience store for ice cream, according to TIME magazine.

The clock read 8.59pm when Ifergan purchased the tickets, and the cutoff time for the draw was 9pm.

With only seconds left before the clock struck nine, the first of the two tickets popped out, but the second was seven seconds late which led to the new draw date, the Globe and Mail reports.

'I’m really disappointed in the decision, and it’s not because it’s about the money,' Ifergan told CTV

'My crusade is up, I've done all I can, I spent enough money going to the Supreme Court... it cost me a lot of money, but it also consumed me for seven years.'

The Quebec Superior Court ruled against Ifergan in 2012 and the Court of Appeal ruled against him in 2014.

System: Ifergan argued that the company's slow-processing system puts people in Quebec at a disadvantage compared with the rest of Canada

Loto-Quebec spokesman, Jean-Pierre Roy, told CTV that no protocol changes will be made in the future.

'The judgement was clear and convincing that Loto-Quebec procedures were altogether reliable and integrated and were the right ones,' Roy said.

But, Ifergan argued that the company's slow-processing system puts people in Quebec at a disadvantage compared with the rest of Canada, according to CTV. 

'Had those tickets been bought anywhere else in Canada, I would have been a millionaire seven years ago,' Ifergan said. 

The Lotto Super 7 has since been discontinued and replaced with Lotto Max.
