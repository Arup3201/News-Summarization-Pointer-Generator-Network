Luis Enrique will continue to speak to his players before making changes during games despite Lionel Messi's negative reaction in Saturday's 3-0 victory against Eibar.

The Barcelona manager wanted to give his star man a rest during the second period but Messi made his intention to complete the full match clear and he was allowed to stay on.

Speaking ahead of his side's Champions League clash with Ajax, Enrique told AS: 'Before making changes we generally ask the players and we make the decision afterwards.

'What happened can be interpreted many ways, depending on who it serves. I will carry on doing what I have been doing.'

The same publication also has quotes from Atletico Madrid chief executive Gil Marin, who claims that the club had planned to re-sign Fernando Torres from Chelsea last summer.

The striker grew up at Atleti before joining Liverpool in 2007 but a return to the Vicente Calderon was not completed as manager Diego Simeone hadn't asked for him.Â 

Marca and Mundo Deportivo both carry the news that Gareth Bale has been ruled out of Real Madrid's European game against Liverpool at Anfield on Wednesday.

The Welshman has reportedly suffered a muscle tear in his buttock and will be out for at least 15 days.

Over in Italy, La Gazzetta dello Sport focus on Filippo Inzaghi's impact at AC Milan and have Roma midfielder Daniele De Rossi insisting his side will attack Bayern Munich in the Champions League.

Tuttosport and Corriere dello Sport both continue to cover the fallout from Juventus' controversial win over Serie A title rivals Roma a few weeks ago.

The referee from that match, Gianluca Rocchi, admits he was wrong to give a penalty against Rudi Garcia's side and hopes his performance will not affect his career as an official.
