The Great British Bake Off may conjure up images of summer garden parties but it's set to be a Christmas staple this festive season.

Cook books associated with the BBC TV show - that pulled in 9.1m viewers this year - are dominating bestseller lists.

Recipes from the show's judges Mary Berry and Paul Hollywood are so in demand they have even knocked Jamie Oliver off his throne as the king of celebrity chefs.

For the past two years, Oliver has topped the Christmas bestseller lists but his latest cook book, Save With Jamie, is currently being out sold by Great British Bake Off: Everyday Over 100 Foolproof Recipes and Paul Hollywood's Pies And Puds at Tesco.

Bake Off related tomes make up five of the top ten bestselling recipe books from the supermarket.

Berry has three different books that are selling fast - her Complete Cookbook, Christmas Collection and Cookery Course.

Lost his crown: Jamie Oliver usually tops the Christmas book chart but Save With Jamie, left, is only Tesco's fifth highest selling book from a celebrity chef. Nigel Slater's Eat, right, is outselling Oliver at Tesco and Amazon

Tesco book buyer Hazel Powell said: 'The 
Great British Bake Off is now so popular that it has helped create the 
biggest home baking revival in decades and turn what was an occasional 
dabble into one of our most popular hobbies.

'As a result, the show and its two chefs Paul Hollywood and Mary Berry will dominate the book chart this Christmas.

'Jamie Oliver of course also features in the list as do a couple of other long term favourites; Nigel Slater and Rick Stein.'

Slater's book called Eat - The Little Book Of Fast Food, is also outselling Oliver's at Tesco and is also currently the bestselling recipe book via Amazon.

The book contains 600 simple and quick to cook meal ideas.

Also notable in Tesco's top 10 list is the literary arrival of Tom Kerridge whose successful TV show, Proper Pub Food, has also been enjoying strong viewing figures this year.

The chef, whose pub is the only one in
 Britain to ever earn two Michelin stars, is in fourth place with his 
first book, Proper Pub Food.

Also making up Tesco's stop ten are the Hairy Bikers with their low fat meal ideas.

Bloomsbury,
 who publish Hollywood's recipe books, said profits have risen this year
 thanks to their stable of successful cookery titles.
