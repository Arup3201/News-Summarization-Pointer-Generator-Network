A series of gloomy mini dramas aired during Downton Abbey to promote the show’s sponsor not only enraged viewers but also broke industry rules.

The ten second credits for insurance giant Aviva ran at the beginning and end of commercial breaks.

Early slots traced the true story of Gary, who suffered a motorbike accident. Viewers complained they were depressing and ruined the programme.

Breached rules: In this link for the Aviva mini-drama featuring crash victim Gary, he says: 'It's my insurance policy. I think I am still covered if I do that course.' Ofcom said the line promoted the sponsor's income protection policy

Now industry regulator OFCOM has ruled that some scenes contained an ‘advertising message’ which is not allowed in sponsorship promotions.

‘Credits must not encourage the purchase or rental of the products or services of the sponsor or a third party,’ a spokesman explained.

‘The focus of the credit must be the sponsorship itself.’

The latest controversy comes on top of concerns that the series, starring Dame Maggie Smith and Hugh Bonneville, was swamped by ad breaks, with up to one minute of promotions for every three of Downton Abbey.

Broadcasters are restricted to 12 minutes of advertising per hour and credits are not counted towards the total.

The credits, which sparked viewers' 
complaints because of their regularity, featured his recovery, his 
inability to return to work and his decision to retrain for a new 
career.

In 
one of the links, Gary was seen to be reading an insurance document and 
tells his partner: 'It's my insurance policy. I think I am still covered
if I do that course.'

Ofcom judged that that line promoted a benefit of the sponsor's income protection policy.

Aviva amended subsequent sponsorship credits, which featured a character called Jane, removing the phrase 'It's my insurance policy'.

But Ofcom said that they were still in breach of the broadcasting code because 'it was still clear that the character was referring to an insurance policy that covered him even if he undertook a training course'.

Ofcom said: 'We concluded that the sponsorship credit contained an advertising message and therefore was in breach of the rule.'

The mini-drama was shown in September and October during six episodes of Downton.

Despite drawing record-breaking audiences, it is the latest setback to hit the ITV drama which has been criticised for having too much advertising.

In other complaints:

In their ruling, Ofcom said sponsorship could not contain advertising messages.

Ofcom said in its ruling: 'To prevent 
credits effectively becoming advertisements and therefore increasing the
amount of advertising transmitted, broadcasters are required to ensure 
that sponsorship credits do not contain advertising messages.'

Channel TV, responding for ITV, said the reference to the benefit was 'a brief product description' rather than an advertising message 'about a distinct benefit of Aviva's cover.'

The mini drama has previously been heavily criticised by viewers who regarded the clips as adverts.

But executives at Aviva believed its campaign would strike a chord with viewers and force them to think about what would happen if they had to take time off work due to injury or illness.
