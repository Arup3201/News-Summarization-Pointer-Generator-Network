Two men face third-degree murder and involuntary manslaughter charges from a crash that killed a mother and three young sons in Philadelphia.

A fourth son was also injured crossing the 12-lane highway plagued by pedestrian deaths, police said.

Khusen Akhmedov, 23, of Lancaster, and Ahmen Holloman, 30, of Philadelphia, were arrested Wednesday night.

Investigators believe they may have been drag racing. The pair also faces charges of homicide by vehicle, recklessly endangering another person, aggravated assault, simple assault and aggravated assault by vehicle stemming from the crash on Tuesday night.

Listed telephone numbers for the suspects couldn't immediately be located, and it wasn't clear if they had attorneys.

Samara Banks, 28, and three of her sons were killed as they crossed Roosevelt Boulevard at a point with grassy medians dividing the traffic lanes, but no crosswalk or traffic light.

Her 23-month-old baby Saa'sean died at the scene, nine-month-old baby Saa'mir died after reaching hospital and her four-year-old son Saa'deem died yesterday. Her oldest, a five-year-old, survived with bumps and bruises.

Banks often called a cab to take her and her four little boys home from family visits on the other side of the boulevard, relatives said.

But on Tuesday night, she thought temperatures had cooled down enough to walk the mile back home from her aunt's house.

'The cab service knows her well,' 
said LaTanya Byrd, an aunt who described Banks as a devoted mother who 
had helped raise siblings after her own mother died. 'Last night, it got
a little cooler and she felt she could walk.'

Roosevelt
Boulevard had the nation's 2nd and 3rd most dangerous intersections in a
2001 insurance company study, which tallied 618 crashes at those two 
intersections alone in a two-year period.

The
speed limit is 40 mph where Banks and her boys were killed, but drivers
frequently go 10 or 20 mph above that to make — or run — a light, 
neighbors said Wednesday.

Many
residents of the lower-income area don't have cars and are left to 
traverse the boulevard on foot to get to schools, parks and stores.

Just
hours after Banks and her boys died, Iris Rolon chose the same 
mid-block route to cross with her 10-year-old daughter and 8-year-old 
niece.

They were walking to a city pool on the 95-degree day.

'It
ain't safe, but I like to wait until I see that the light changes,' 
said Rolon, adding she once had a close call crossing the boulevard in 
her youth.

Police 
could not immediately provide more recent data on fatal or non-fatal 
accidents on the road, but news reports detail a few of them.

Last
August, 43-year-old Michael Romano died after pushing his 5-year-old 
son out of danger just before he was struck by a hit-and-run driver at 
11 p.m.

His death came just days after another man was killed in a 2 a.m. hit and run nearby.

And 36-year-old pedestrian Brenda Rodriguez was struck and killed in June 2009 after she and a friend picked up Chinese food.

Witnesses said she was struck as two drivers were racing each other; both of them fled.

The deaths continued even after the city started installing red-light cameras to try to calm traffic.

'Every
time I cross the boulevard, I see somebody running the light. I think 
they don't know there's a camera there,' said Angel Mendoza, 32, who 
lives a block away.

Banks
had previously worked at a day care center, and her apartment was often
the gathering spot for her large extended family, relatives said.

They
plan to bury her with her 7-month-old son in a cemetery plot just 
across the street, and bury her 23-month-old and 4-year-old together in 
an adjacent plot.

'She was a great parent,' Byrd said. 'When her mom passed, she just took over and got things done.'

Samara's family were about 6ft from the sidewalk when an Audi hit them with such force that it knocked Ms Banks 200ft.

Ms
Banks, who had helped raise her sister and three brothers after their 
mother died seven years ago, took her own sons everywhere with her, 
always insisting that they hold hands.

'That's why all of them got hit,' Nicole Holmes, one of her cousins, said.

'She was a beautiful person and she loved her kids,' Rose Williams, Ms Banks's aunt, said. 'That's why they were all with her.'

As relatives gathered at her home to comfort each other, they remembered Ms Banks as a good parent who always made sure her children were well-behaved and happy, and loved taking them on trips to the zoo and library.
