Hate preacher: Abu Hamza may strike a deal with U.S. authorities and plead guilty in return for a lighter sentence

Hate preacher Abu Hamza may strike a deal with U.S. authorities and plead guilty in return for a lighter sentence, it emerged today.

The radical Islamist cleric is facing terrorism charges in the U.S. after he was last month finally extradited from Britain following an eight-year legal battle.

His lawyer, Jeremy Schneider, yesterday said there is now a possibility of a 'plea bargain', although Hamza currently denies all charges.

He told The Sun: 'If they offer something agreeable to the defendant and myself, we would accept it.'

Hamza, known for his signature metal hooks, appeared in court without prosthetics on October 26, his arms visibly red.

The white-haired and white-bearded cleric, who has asked to be referred to in court by his birth name, Mustafa Kamel Mustafa, pleaded not guilty to 11 criminal charges at an earlier hearing last month.

He is being held in the maximum security section, known as South 10, of the Metropolitan Correctional Center next door to the courthouse in lower Manhattan.

Hamza was accused in 2004 of participating in hostage-taking in Yemen in 1998 that led to the deaths of three Britons and an Australian. A trial date has been set for August 26, 2013.

He is also charged with providing material support to the Al Qaeda network by trying to set up a training camp in Oregon and attempting to organize support for the Taliban in Afghanistan.

At the October 26 hearing, U.S. 
District Judge Katherine Forrest asked both sides about the potential 
size and scope of the case, which spans 14 years and three continents.

Federal prosecutor Edward Kim said 47 boxes of documents and evidence would need to be shipped from Britain.

Mr Schneider requested more lawyers to work on the case and said his client would help in preparing his defence.

The judge said the defense could have
two law firm partners, two associates and two paralegals, 'resources to
put on a full and fair defence'.

She scheduled the next hearing for December 14.

Earlier this week, it emerged that 
Hamza is to be given new prosthetic hands after U.S. authorities refused
to allow him to wear metal hooks in place when outside his jail cell. 
They will be paid for by the U.S. government.

army in Afghanistan.

Mr Schneider said the prosthetics he 
is allowed to wear, only inside the maximum security jail cell where he 
is being held, cause pain and irritation on his skin.

'I have no idea what the new prosthetics look like,' Mr Schneider said.
