Mother Teila Veronica Williams, 24, is charged with first degree cruelty to children

A mother has been arrested after her ten-week-old baby was diagnosed with multiple broken bones and a detached retina.

The baby's twin brother was found dead at the weekend - his cause of death has not yet been determined.

Mother Teila Veronica Williams, 24, was arrested Wednesday night and charged with first degree cruelty to children.

Additional charges are possible when investigators determine how the baby boy died, police said. 

The baby girl was found after police were called to the home in Snellville, Georgia, following reports of her twin's death.

But it soon became clear that his twin sister needed urgent medical attention and she was taken to a local hospital, reports AJC.com.

At the hospital, doctors determined she had broken ribs, arms and legs, as well as a detached retina, the warrant states.

The little girl was then flown to Children's Healthcare of Atlanta, the arrest warrant states. 

'Child likely suffered from nutritional neglect and given the infant's clinical picture, it is consistent with medical neglect,' a doctor said according to the warrant. 

Investigators have not determined who caused the baby's injuries.

Captain Carey Roberts told Channel 2 Action News officers plan to interview three other adults who also live in the home.

Williams was being held on $5,700 bond Thursday night at the Gwinnett County jail, booking records showed. 

Her other four children are in protective custody, according to police.
