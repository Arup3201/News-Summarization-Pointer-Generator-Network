A house that was sold in a state of rank squalor has been cleaned and put back on the market just six months later - for £10,000 more.

The filthy three-bedroom semi-detached home in Short Heath Road, Erdington, Birmingham, was sold for £114,950 in March after being advertised on property search website Zoopla.

The photos of the house resembled a bombsite, with filthy dishes piled on sinks and counter-tops, floors stained and partially hidden by garbage and mountains of clothes heaped in every room.

Filth: Dirty dishes, disused mugs and empty containers litter the kitchen in this shocking property advertisement photo which appeared on website Zoopla in February

Slight improvement: A new image which has appeared on property search websites, Zoopla and Rightmove, shows a cleaner kitchen - albeit still needing some work

Despite the shocking pictures, estate agent Burchell Edwards optimistically described the property as a 'period style' house featuring 'Minton tiled flooring' in the vestibule and a 'generous lounge'.

The property also boasted a 'family bathroom' and a third bedroom 'bigger than your normal sized third bedroom' as well as being just half-a-mile from Erdington Train Station and local shops.

The kitchen diner was described as featuring 'a range of wall and base units incorporating a one-and-a-half bowl stainless steel sink with drainer, integrated appliances to include oven, hob and microwave'.

Astonishingly - the property was viewed 14 times by prospective buyers and was on the market for one month before being bought for the full asking price in March.

Squalor: The living room was pictured online looking like a bombsite with rubbish piled everywhere - yet the property still attracted a buyer

Clean up: The latest advert shows a tidier living room - the house in Erdington, Birmingham, is now on the market for £125,000 

It was purchased by a property developer who hoped to renovate it and turn it into a luxury family home.

But today it emerged that the house was for sale again and, in a sign of the rising housing market, had an asking price of £125,000 - a £10,000 increase in just six months.  

The buyer, who has not been identified, initially described the house as 'a palace'.

But yesterday his love for the property seemed to have waned as updated pictures of the inside of the house looking tidier appeared on the Zoopla website.

Grim: The bedroom was originally captured with piles of clothes obscuring the bed and drawers hanging open spilling their contents on to the hidden floor

Empty: The clothes have been taken away but the bedroom is far from welcoming with the door off its hinges and a shoddy-looking cabinet in the middle of the floor

Andy Keogh, of Erdington Estate Agents, said: 'The guy who bought it was a property developer but he only got as far as emptying all the rubbish out and then he ran out of time.

'It's not perfect, it needs a new roof, new windows, new central heating, new everything. It's a massive challenge.

'And someone who likes gardening. Homes that need work get more attention. It needs everything doing, it needs gutting and starting again.' 

On Zoopla, the latest advertisement confesses: 'The property has featured in The Daily Mail when the property was full of furniture and rubbish (now removed). The property will need a full refurbishment and is on the market due to the new owner not been able to complete the works.

'It would suit someone with plenty of time on their hands and be able to restore the property to a liveable condition. The property is huge inside and should be viewed to appreciate the space on offer either as a family home or multi-room let property.'  

Original advert: The post appeared on Zoopla in February with estate agent Burchell Edwards optimistically describing the property as a 'period style' house

Fresh on the market: The cleaner property has reappeared online with an asking price of £125,000 - £10,000 more than it was bought for in March

On the latest Zoopla advert, it reads: 'The property would suit someone with plenty of time on their hands and be able to restore the property to a liveable condition'

Home went on the market in February - appearing on property website Zoopla in a state of absolute filth

Amazingly it was sold for its asking price of £115,000 to property developer who hoped to turn it into luxury home

But after six months he's only cleared out the rubbish and cleaned the rooms, with the house still not 'liveable'

Despite this - it's now back on the market for £125,000 - with new Zoopla photos showing off house's tidy rooms.
