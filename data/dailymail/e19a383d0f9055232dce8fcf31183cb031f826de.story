Tragedy: Liza Benson, 28, was killed after getting caught in an avalanche last Sunday; she died in her boyfriend's arms

A seasoned skier who was caught in an avalanche drew her last breathes in her boyfriend’s arms after the barrage of snow swept her into a tree.

Elizabeth ‘Liza’ Benson was backcountry skiing with her boyfriend, Jason Ray, near Clause Peak in Wyoming last weekend when the slide drew her into the tree, causing fatal head and body trauma.

Ms Benson’s death was not the only ski-related fatality – nearly 60 miles away, veteran skier and Grand Teton National Park employee Nick Gillespie died when he was caught in an avalanche at the park. Their deaths were the first people to die in slides this winter.

On Sunday afternoon, Ms Benson was skiing with her boyfriend, and two other friends, including a physician. The group was skiing in the backcountry, where the powder is often fresher, but there is a significant risk of avalanches.

According to the Sublette County Sheriff’s Department, the 28-year-old athlete was caught in a small slide west of Bondurant. Trapped in the snows, she hit a tree.

Mr Ray, who works as a seasonal administrator for the Sublette County Search & Rescue team, rushed down to her aide.

The physician was quick on the scene as well and administered CPR to Ms Benson, but realized the young woman had died in her boyfriend’s arms.

Ms Benson was slated to graduate with a physician’s assistant degree, according to the Jackson Hole News and Guide.

‘I know she died happy and with someone she loved so much,’ her sister, Adrienne Benson, told the paper. ‘And it was really fast.’

Other friends and co-workers described her as passionate, with a deep love for the outdoors.

She had met Mr Ray at a clinic last October, and told her sister that only after a week, she had met her soulmate. 

Mr Ray told the News and Guide that they were ‘doing what we loved together when tragedy struck.’ He added that the two had plans to marry.

Longtime Grand Teton National Park seasonal employee Nick Gillespie, 30, of Jackson, was also caught in an avalanche around 5 p.m. Sunday on the southeast face of Survey Peak and died of injuries from the slide, park officials said Monday.

Gillespie, who had worked on Grand Teton National Park's trail crew the past six seasons, was with three other people who tried to resuscitate him, park spokeswoman Jackie Skaggs said.

When they were unable to, they carried his body to a backcountry patrol cabin, where they spent the night.

They weren't able to make a telephone call to authorities until around 9 p.m. Sunday, so rangers weren't able to fly in to the remote area until last Monday.

Park officials said the avalanche danger was listed as low last Sunday morning but was expected to rise to moderate in the afternoon between 9,000 and 10,500 feet, meaning human-triggered avalanches were possible.

The avalanche danger was rated as considerable Monday at middle and high-elevations in the Tetons and moderate in the Togwotee Pass and Greys River areas.

The Tetons got significant snowfall over the weekend following a prolonged dry, cold period. 

The snowpack is unstable because the new snow is resting on old snow that is either weak because it has crystalized and become grainy or slick because the snow melted and then turned icy, said Jim Springer of the Bridger-Teton Avalanche Center.

The danger is higher on the west side of the Tetons, where up to 18 inches of snow fell Sunday.
