A puppy was taken away from its owner this week after testing positive
for drugs even though there is not enough evidence to charge the New Mexico
woman with any crime.

Arlene Saiz, 30, of Albuqurque, says she brought the dog to a
veterinarian Tuesday after it began acting strangely and was told it tested
positive for cocaine and marijuana – she insists she has no idea where the drugs
came from.

The single mother claims the vet and police then coerced her
into signing a document that forfeited her rights to Maddie because she asked to
be billed for the visit.

Taken away: 11-month-old puppy Maddie has been placed in the care of the city

Ms Saiz told MailOnline that she and her 11-year-old
daughter became concerned when Maddie become unsteady on her feet during a
walk.

They took the dog home and it soon started twitching, shaking and having trouble holding up
its own head, said Ms Saiz, that’s when she rushed Maddie to the vet.

‘I thought something maybe bit her, I didn’t know what was
wrong with her.’

Veterinarians quickly told her otherwise.

‘She has marijuana in her system,’ Ms Saiz recalled being
told.

The veterinarian went into the back and again came out.

‘Your dog has cocaine in her system,’ the veterinarian said.

'I don't take drugs': Arlene Saiz, the dog's former owner, claims she doesn't take drugs and didn't give them to the dog

The city won't give Maddie back: City officials refuse to return Maddie, saying Ms Saiz signed away her rights to the puppy

Soon police arrived and teamed up with doctors to force her
to sign a document saying she couldn’t pay for the visit and release the dog
into the custody of the city, she said.

It was the only way to keep the dog alive, she says she was
told.

The dog is being taken care of by the city, according to
KOAT. It has since suffered from multiple seizures and an infection.

Mr Saiz says she asked to be billed for the visit.

‘I can pay for the dog,’ she said, adding that she wasn’t
provided that option.

A toxicology report obtained by the Albuquerque Journal concluded the dog may have eaten cocaine-laced marijuana.

The call center employee claims she has never done drugs and
will gladly take a drug test to prove it wasn’t her that gave the dog the
illicit substances.

‘I have an 11-year-old daughter, I’m a single mother, I
don’t take drugs,’ she said, adding that child welfare officials checked in on
her daughter, and even interviewed her without permission.

Friendly: Maddie is very friendly and often played with Ms Saiz's daughter - the woman claims the dog tried to play with neighbor children as well, which may have led to a conflict

Her daytime digs: Maddie often spent her days in the backyard while Ms Saiz worked, the single mother believes someone spiked her dog's food

She has since tried to get the dog back, but the city isn’t
budging. A spokesperson told KOAT the dog wasn’t spayed or licensed – she
cannot have Maddie back.

Police have declined to press charges, citing a lack of evidence tying her to the dog's drugging.

When asked where the dog could possibly have found cocaine
and marijuana, Ms Saiz said Maddie is normally kept outside while she is at work, someone
may have spiked the poor pooch’s food.

‘I know one of my neighbors doesn’t like my dog,’ she said,
explaining Maddie tried to play with the neighbor’s children a few times.

She also blamed a 'poop-like' substance the dog ate near an outdoor trash can, explaining Maddie started acting funny after eating it.

Maddie will either be handed to a rescue agency or put into
an adoption program once healthy, a city official told KOAT. Ms Saiz is unable
to adopt any pets for one full year because she signed the waiver.

Ms Saiz has hired a lawyer and is pursuing legal action to
be reunited with the dog. She is also considering a civil suit against both the
city and the vet’s office.
