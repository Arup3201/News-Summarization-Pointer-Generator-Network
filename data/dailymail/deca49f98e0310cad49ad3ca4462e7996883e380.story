Washington's National Portrait Gallery has joined the legion of fans paying tribute to late actor Robin Williams.

The gallery is displaying a photograph of the comedian that was taken for the cover of a Time magazine issue that was published in March 1979.

The portrait shows Williams, then a fresh-faced 27-year-old, during his meteoric rise to fame as Mork from the television comedy Mork & Mindy.

In memoriam: National Portrait Gallery in Washington pays tribute to late actor Robin Williams

David Ward, senior historian at the National Portrait Gallery, said the photograph is from the gallery's Time collection.

He told Smithsonian.com: 'It was just as he made his breakthrough from stand-up to TV and then movies.'  

After he learned of the Oscar-winning actor's death, Ward assembled a team to retrieve the image from off-site storage and prepare a spot for it.

The Time article that accompanied the photo documents Williams' ascent from 'a nobody' to a national television star who was watched by an average of 60 million viewers a week.

The article began: 'Five months ago he was what Hollywood likes to call a complete nobody.

'He became what moguls love to call an overnight star.'

The photograph was taken by Michael Dressler.

It will be displayed for a few weeks in a spot where the National Portrait Gallery hangs portraits of icons who have passed away, Smithsonian.com reports.

Williams was found hanged in his home near San Francisco on Monday morning, authorities say.
