From colourful TV adverts and shiny pictures in magazines, to rambunctious cider tents at music festivals and clinky bottles of wine on restaurant tables: it is impossible to shield your children from alcohol completely.

Whether or not you choose to drink in front of them, however, is up to you. But by doing so could you be setting a dangerous example, and setting them up for a troublesome relationship with the sauce as adults?

Two mothers appeared today on ITV's This Morning to debate the issue, with journalist Shona Sibary maintaining that enjoying a glass of wine over dinner with her husband sets her children a beneficial example, while writer Liz Fraser stressed that children who see everyday drinking as normal will use that as their life model.

It's fine if it's with food: Does drinking alcohol every night with dinner teach children that everyday drinking is acceptable?

A recent investigation discovered that last year there were 293 cases of children aged 11 or under attending A&E with alcohol-related conditions, anf 6,500 under-18s.

This has lead to prominent alcohol education charity Drinkaware beseeching parents to have the 'alcohol chat' with their children before it's too late.

Speaking to Holly Willoughby and Philip Schofield, mother-of-four Sibary said: 'My children - the eldest of whom is almost 15 - see me drinking a glass of wine in the evening - with my husband, with food - to relax.

'They see it in moderation. They don't see me drunk or staggering.

'It's naive to think children aren't going to come across alcohol when they leave home, and it's safer for them to learn about it here with me rather than by binge drinking at university.'

Fraser said: 'It's hard to disagree with this, but we're talking about the more extreme things. Of course it's a good idea for children to see parents having a good relationship with alcohol, the problem is when it's every day, when wine is on the table every night at dinner.

'Health professionals say we should stop daily drinking and make that clear to children from the ages of 0 to 10. Instead of "When Mummy's tired she has a drink".

'You see it on Twitter - "5 o'clock: wine o'clock" - 5 o'clock shouldn't be wine o'clock! It should be make the kids tea o'clock, or go for a walk o'clock, or go to the gym o'clock.

'Drinking alcohol should not be an everyday thing.'

Sibary counteracted the argument explaining daily drinking is part of European culture and also done in the Mediterranean. She reiterated that she'd rather alcohol wasn't a hidden topic, but discussed openly within her family so her children were less likely to rebel later on.

'I will give my kids a drink before they go to university - half a beer or a glasss of wine - so hey can understand the effect alcohol has on their bodies.Â 

'I have alcoholism in my family and so my
kids have seen the negative effects it can have. Seeimg me 
drinking one glass of wine in the evening is not the same. I object to the guilt trip mothers are when they have a glass of wine at the end of a stressful day.'

Fraser, who admitted having bought her 15-year-old a bottle of beer when she took her to the Edinburgh Festival, said it was precisely that language that caused the problem, leading children to believe that the solution to feeling stressed, tired or even hungry is at the bottom of a bottle.
