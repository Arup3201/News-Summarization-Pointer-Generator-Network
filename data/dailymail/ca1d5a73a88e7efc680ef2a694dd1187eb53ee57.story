Announced earlier this year, the Watch it set to go on sale in spring 2015, with the cheapest model costing $295, and more expensive luxury versions expected to cost thousands more.

The new kit allows developers to start building apps for the Apple Watch, which is expected to go on sale in Spring, with prices starting at $295.

The Apple watch will use three types of app. 

Notifications allow users to take action or respond right from their wrist such as turning the lights off after they've left the house, quickly accessing flight details at the airport, and rerouting their transit when a train or bus is late.

Glances, which quickly show users information they care about most, such as the latest news and sports scores, alarm system status or the next step of a favorite recipe.

Full apps can use a developer's own interface. 

 'Apple Watch is our most personal device ever, and WatchKit provides the incredible iOS developer community with the tools they need to create exciting new experiences right on your wrist,' said Philip Schiller, Apple's senior vice president of Worldwide Marketing.

'With the iOS 8.2 beta SDK, developers can now start using WatchKit to create breakthrough new apps, Glances and actionable notifications designed for the innovative Apple Watch interface and work with new technologies such as Force Touch, Digital Crown and Taptic Engine.'

Instagram is one of the first to create an app for the Apple Watch.

'Apple Watch allows us to make the Instagram experience even more intimate and in the moment,' says Kevin Systrom, co-founder and CEO of Instagram. 

'With actionable notifications you can see and instantly like a photo or react with an emoji. The Instagram news and watch list allows you to see your friends' latest photos, follow new accounts and get a real-time view of your likes and comments.'

Developers can create notifications that allow users to take action or respond right from their wrist such as turning the lights off after they've left the house, quickly accessing flight details at the airport, and rerouting their transit when a train or bus is late. 

They can also incorporate Glances, which quickly show users information they care about most, such as the latest news and sports scores, alarm system status or the next step of a favorite recipe.

Finally, they can build full apps that use their own interface. 

The Apple watch will use three types of app. WatchKit apps have two parts: A WatchKit extension that runs on iPhone and a set of user interface resources that are installed on Apple Watch. When your app is launched on Apple Watch, the WatchKit extension on iPhone runs in the background to update the user interface and respond to user interactions.

American Airlines has already created an app

Others who were given early access include American Airlines. and ESPN.

'Fans crave real-time and personal information, and the ESPN app for Apple Watch gives us the ability to deliver live scores and information for their favorite teams,' said John Kosner, executive vice president of Digital and Print Media, ESPN. 

'Glances provide fans with a snapshot of live games, and if there is no game taking place, they'll get valuable game-time information or the final box score. 

'With actionable notifications, the experience becomes even more personal, as fans receive alerts on score changes, news and more.'

'The American Airlines app on Apple Watch reminds you when it's time to head to the airport via pre-trip notifications, and provides updates for gate changes, connecting gate info upon arrival, and will notify you when boarding begins if you're not at the gate yet,' said John Gustafson, American Airlines vice president of Digital. 

'Travelers can also ask 'Where am I?' in-flight and get real-time location information at 30,000 ft.' 

The WatchKit site includes programming guides, human interface guidelines, templates and more. 

Starting later next year, developers will be able to create fully native apps for Apple Watch.
