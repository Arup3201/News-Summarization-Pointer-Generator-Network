A robber disguised as a Muslim mother wheeling a pram is being sought by police after helping an armed gang raid a jewellers.

The man used his disguise to trick staff inside Choice Jewellers in Rusholme, Manchester, into unlocking the shop's security door on Sunday morning.

Producing an axe, he then wedged the door open with the pram so that his three masked accomplices - one armed with a sword, and another with a sledgehammer - could storm into the store.

CCTV footage taken from inside the shop shows staff reeling in terror as the gang run rampant, smashing up glass cabinets storing a hoard of jewellery.

They continue to loot gems even after the manager triggers a booby trap that fills the shop floor with dry ice.

The gang then flees outside - but the robber in a burka starts smashing the shop window with his axe in a bid to grab more loot.

The robbers eventually escape in a waiting black saloon car.

Greater Manchester Police today released footage of the raid as they appealed to catch the robbers.

Detective Constable Ian Wrench said: 'The men who carried out this frightening robbery need to be caught so I would ask anyone who saw the men either going in or out of the shop to please call us.

'The jewellery stolen is worth quite a lot of money, and the robbers may try to sell it on the black market.

'I would urge anyone who is offered jewellery from anyone other than a licensed dealer to not fall victim by
 buying these stolen goods and call us immediately.

'The first offender is described as a 
tall person wearing a burka. The three offenders who got out of the car 
were all dressed in dark clothing with their faces covered by 
balaclavas.'

The raid occurred shortly before 11.35am on Sunday, police said.
