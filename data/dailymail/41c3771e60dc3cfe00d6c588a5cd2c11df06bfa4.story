Vincent Kompany has allayed any lingering injury fears after departing Belgium’s Euro 2016 qualifier early on Friday night.

The Manchester City captain was substituted in the 55th minute, with pictures emerging of the central defender appearing to be given some treatment to his right leg.

But Kompany is insistent that his withdrawal – Belgium were already three goals up against Andorra – was merely a precaution.

There were concerns over a potential injury for the Manchester City captain as he was strapped up on the bench after being substituted after 55 minutes

‘Before the game I already had a slight problem and the coach decided to take me out,’ Kompany told RTBF.

‘I am now getting ready for Bosnia. It was not easy out there.’

While Marc Wilmots will want the 28-year-old fit and firing for a sterner test against Bosnia on Monday night, it is Manuel Pellegrini who will be breather the heavier sigh of relief.

City can ill-afford to be without their skipper during a crucial four days to see them face Tottenham at the Etihad Stadium next Saturday before a trip to CSKA Moscow in the Champions League as they attempt to get back on track in Group E.
