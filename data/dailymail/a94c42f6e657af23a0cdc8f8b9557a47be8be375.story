They got engaged in February after five years of dating and it appears as if Jenson Button has married Jessica Micibata just before  2014 comes to an end.

The Formula One ace and the beautiful model have been enjoying a luxurious holiday in Maui, Hawaii over the festive period and Jessica, 30, hinted they had tied the knot when she posted a picture to Instagram of herself in a beautiful white dress on Christmas Eve. 

Jessica simply wrote: 'Feeling white for #christmaseve  Jewlry from @mauimarioceanjewelry @jacquieaiche dress by @keikosasaki_mylan,' but the dress is decidedly bride-like and she made sure her huge diamond engagement ring was front and centre in the photograph. 

MailOnline has contacted representatives for Jenson and Jessica for comment.

And a number of fans took to Twitter to congratulate the duo on their wedding, even though it has yet to be officially confirmed.

The couple confirmed their engagement in February after Jessica was pictured in the paddock during day three of Formula One Winter Testing at the Bahrain International Circuit weariing a huge diamond ring.

A spokesperson for Jenson, 34, formally confirmed the news and declared that the couple were 'delighted'.

Congratulations: Many fans took to Twitter to congratulate the couple on their reported wedding 

The Japanese model first met Jenson in 2008 in a hotel bar in Tokyo and originally perceived him to be something of a womaniser, turning him down when he first asked her out.

Eight months later she finally gave in to his pursuits and the pair started dating.

Jenson was at the lowest point in his career after finishing 18th in the championship and being dropped by sponsor Honda, but that didn't stop their relationship going from strength to strength.

But it wasn't until Jenson became Formula One World Champion in Brazil in 2009 that Jessica realised just how strong his love for her was, when he dedicated his win to her, live on television.

The pair split in 2011, but spoke constantly during their time apart and decided to give their relationship another go six months later. 

Of Jessica's stunning engagement ring, Vashi Dominguez, CEO and founder of diamond jewellery specialist Vashi.com told MailOnline: 'This is a stunning engagement ring but a brave choice if Jenson selected it himself.

'It looks to be a pear shaped five carat diamond three stone engagement ring set in platinum and we would estimate the cost would be in excess of £250,000.'

He added: 'As the ring is so unusual, we suspect it might be an occasional piece for show rather than being worn every day, as for someone as sporty and active as Jessica the shape and weight is not very practical.

'It is not unusual for couples to invest in a second, more practical ring when a large stone such as this is purchased, so we may well see Jessica occasionally wearing a more traditional round cut solitaire when in need of something for everyday wear.'

News of Jenson's engagement was some welcome happy tidings shortly after the sudden death of Jenson's father, John Button, who died in January aged 70. 

John passed away from a heart attack at his home on the French Riviera. 

He was an extremely popular and ever-present figure in the grand prix paddock, and missed only one of his son's 247 Grands Prix starts. 

The ultimate reward for the father-son duo came in 2009 when Jenson, who started the campaign as an underdog, was crowned world champion. 

When Mr Button split from his wife Simone (Jenson's mother), Jenson moved in with his father but remained close to his mother and older sisters, Natasha, Samantha and Tanya.
