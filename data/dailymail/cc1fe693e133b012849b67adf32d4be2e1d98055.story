When authorities found an 11-year-old Guatemalan boy's body just about a mile from Texas' southern border, they also discovered his brother's Chicago phone number scribbled on the inside of his belt buckle.

The boy, wearing Angry Birds jeans, black leather boots and a white rosary around his neck, had apparently gotten lost on his way north from his native country and was found earlier this month, alone in the brush less than a mile from the nearest U.S. home, a South Texas sheriff said Monday.

While hundreds of immigrants die crossing the border each year, the discovery of Gilberto Francisco Ramos Juarez's decomposed body in the Rio Grande Valley earlier this month highlights the perils unaccompanied children face as the U.S. government searches for ways to deal with record numbers of children crossing into the country illegally.

'Down here finding a decomposed body ... we come across them quite often,' Hidalgo County Sheriff Eddie Guerra said, adding that this was the first child immigrant his office has found since he became sheriff in April. 'It's a very dangerous journey.'

More than 52,000 unaccompanied children have been apprehended entering the U.S. illegally since October, creating what President Barack Obama has called an 'urgent humanitarian situation.'

On Monday, Obama asked Congress for more money and additional authority to deal with the surge of youths, mostly from Central America. Obama wants flexibility to speed the youths' deportations and $2 billion in new money to hire more immigration judges and open more detention facilities.

The number of unaccompanied immigrant children arrested along the border has been rising for three years as they fled pervasive gang violence in Honduras, Guatemala and El Salvador. More recently, children and parents have said they heard children traveling alone and parents traveling with young kids would be released by authorities and allowed to continue to their destination.

Common: Sheriff Eddie Guerra says finding decomposing bodies of immigrants in the desert is not uncommon

Far from home: Gilberto Francisco Ramos Juarez was found dead a mile from the border

Many of the
 children turn themselves in to the first law enforcement person they 
see, so Guerra said it was unusual to find a child in this more remote 
area â€” near La Joya, about 20 miles west of McAllen.

The
 boy's body was found June 15. Sometimes smugglers leave people behind 
if they can't go on; other times a group may scatter when authorities 
approach.

Investigators were able to reach the boy's brother in Chicago; his phone number was one of three on the boy's belt.

It's
 not uncommon for immigrants to put relatives' phone numbers on their 
clothing because scraps of paper can get lost or wet during their 
journey.

The boy's brother gave authorities his father's phone number in Guatemala, and the dad identified the boy's personal items.

The
 cause of death has not been determined, but authorities suspect heat 
stroke, Guerra said. The boy was no longer wearing a shirt when he was 
found. An autopsy did not find signs of trauma and the pathologist 
estimated the body had been there for about two weeks.

The
 boy's family in Huehuetenango, Chiantla, Guatemala, had last heard from
 him about 25 days before his body was found. At that time, he was in 
Reynosa, Mexico, waiting to cross the border. His father told 
authorities the boy was traveling with a coyote, or smuggler.

Although
 the number of immigrant children who have died crossing into Texas was 
not immediately available, such discoveries are not unheard of.
