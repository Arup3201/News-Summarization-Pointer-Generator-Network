Professor Steve Field said he wouldn't hesitate in to close down practices that weren't providing proper care

GP surgeries should open seven days a week to help patients holding down full-time jobs, the new care watchdog says.

Setting out a tough regime of checks on doctors’ surgeries, Steve Field warned those that provide poor care could face big fines and even closure.

Professor Field, who is chief inspector of primary care, said that lazy medics who do not stay open for long enough risk being punished.

He said: ‘I will not hesitate at all to order the closure of GP practices that we find to be unsafe, or providing poor access, or which do not care for patients properly or treat them with dignity.’

While acknowledging the high standard of care provided by most GPs, he said surgeries should provide care seven days a week and described opening hours as ‘patchy’.

Ahead of the introduction of a ratings system for GP surgeries, Professor Field said one in ten surgeries will need to make significant improvements. 

He told the Guardian newspaper: ‘While we’ve got some of the best general practices in the world, it’s let down by a small percentage of practices which aren’t providing appropriate access or quality of care.’

Speaking about the need for longer opening hours, he added: ‘Access should be brilliant, but currently it’s patchy.

‘A lot of patients are dissatisfied with current access and think it’s inadequate. It seems to be a huge source of frustration.

‘We should move to seven-day services in general practice, where patients should be able to access a GP for advice at the weekend.’ Professor Field, who works as a GP in Birmingham, said that patients holding down nine-to-five jobs struggled to make appointments.

Pointing to the rising numbers of surgeries offering appointments later in the evenings and at weekends, he said such working practices should be commonplace. 

He said the need for longer opening hours will be a key assessment criterion for his inspectors.His priority upon taking on the role will be the provision of substandard out-of-hours care, often provided by private contractors such as Serco.

He said: ‘Out-of-hours care has been a concern of mine for years.’

But his plans were immediately met with scepticism by Clare Gerada, chairman of the Royal College of General Practitioners.

‘I would love there to be seven days a week access to GPs,’ she said. ‘But that’s not possible when we need 10,000 more GPs to cope with our growing workload, and when GPs are getting their smallest share of the NHS budget for a decade.

Professor Field listed out-of-hours care as one of his biggest concerns saying patients seem to be 'frustrated' with the current opening hours of GP's surgeries

'We need those in power and authority to understand that and not constantly berate GPs and get the stick out.’

Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt echoed Professor Field’s message, saying GP salaries could be slashed if they fail to look after the elderly. 

He was speaking as new GP contracts are being drawn up, suggesting that he has ‘no problem paying GPs well’ if they give good care.

‘We need to change the model for reactive primary care to proactive primary care and that’s rediscovering the idea of family doctoring, and the idea of a GP who keeps tabs on people whether or not they’re ill,’ he told the Daily Telegraph.

‘We need to be much more ambitious about how people access the system in ways that cost the system a lot less.

‘We’re trapped in a mentality where the heart of primary care provision is a ten-minute GP appointment when actually if you look at what happens in the US, they find that if you allow people to ask questions by email it is cheaper and quicker.’

Professor Field is a former chairman of the Royal College of General Practitioners.
