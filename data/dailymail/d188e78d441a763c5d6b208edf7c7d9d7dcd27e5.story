Riders are getting their first turns on a skyline-changing Las Vegas Strip observation wheel that's opening as the world's tallest.

A ceremony Monday at 11:30 a.m. local time marked the completion of the 550-foot High Roller — built by Caesars Entertainment Corp. as part of its $550 million LINQ development at the heart of the glittery Strip resort corridor.

Standing more than 100-feet taller than the London Eye, the High Roller is the tallest observation wheel in the world.

It's wheely here: It's not the first time someone in Vegas has tried to build an observation wheel. The partially constructed Skyvue is still visible on the south end of the Strip, far short of the 500 feet it was supposed to reach

The Ferris-style wheel has 28 glass-enclosed and air-conditioned gondolas that can each hold up to 40 people.

A full revolution takes 30 minutes. Tickets are $24.95 in the daytime and $34.95 at night.

The height tops the 443-foot London Eye and the 541-foot Singapore Flyer.

Riders can take in unparalleled view of the Las Vegas Strip and surrounding valley during the 30 minutes that the wheel takes to complete one full rotation.

Look at the view: There is an expansive view of the entire Strip. From the Wynn, LVH to the north, and down to Mandalay Bay on the south

Round and round: Each cabin has 300 square feet of glass, so you're guaranteed a great view. There are orange benches on each end. But mostly, people stand

The Ferris wheel is located across from Caesars Palace, adjacent to Flamingo Las Vegas and The Quad Resort & Casino.

Caesars also said each pod is equipped with air conditioning which should provide relief for summertime riders.

Caesars expects between 4 million and 5 million riders within the first year of operation.

The new attraction also will serve as the towering centerpiece of Caesar Entertainment’s LINQ project, the combination retail, restaurant and entertainment complex that first broke ground in 2011.

Flanked by the Flamingo and Quad resort casinos, the half-billion-dollar complex is arguably the biggest development to hit the Strip since CityCenter opened in 2009.

The ride also includes a dynamic video and music show that fades away seamlessly as the wheel ascends to showcase the most impressive views of the Las Vegas valley.

The High Roller is the latest in a string of family-friendly attractions to open in Las Vegas in recent years.

Circus Circus debuted its new roller coaster "El Loco" last month. The Rio is preparing to open a new zipline, and the Slotzilla zipline downtown is also nearing completion.

This summer, families will have two water parks to choose from: Wet ‘n' Wild, which opened last year, and Cowabunga Bay, which is scheduled to open in the coming weeks.
