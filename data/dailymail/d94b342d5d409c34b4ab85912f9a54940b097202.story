Follow the live scores from the third one-day international between Sri Lanka and England in Hambantota as Alastair Cook's men try and get back in the series.

England are 2-0 down in the seven-match series after back-to-back defeats in Colombo, and will need a win in Hambantota to drag themselves back into the series.

Cook's side know they need to improve in all areas after being bowled out for 185 in the second one-day international before watching Sri Lanka stroll to their target inside 35 overs.

England dropped Ian Bell and brought Alex Hales back to bat at No 3 in the third one-day international against Sri Lanka.

After two defeats so far in this seven-match series, the tourists decided on three changes in all at the Mahinda Rajapaksa International Cricket Stadium.

Captain Cook and Moeen Ali's opening partnership will not be disturbed. But further down the order, Chris Jordan and Ben Stokes return - with no James Tredwell or Harry Gurney.

Sri Lanka won the toss on an increasingly cloudy afternoon ahead of this day-night match, and brought Thilina Kandamby in for Mahela Jayawardene - who is missing the fixture for personal reasons.
