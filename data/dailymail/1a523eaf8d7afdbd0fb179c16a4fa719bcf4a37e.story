Motorists were spared fuel price rises as the Chancellor confirmed a freeze on petrol and diesel duty would go ahead as planned from April 2015.

George Osborne announced he was scrapping the ‘trigger-point’ for automatically putting up duty if oil prices drop below a set level, as they did recently.

But yesterday’s parallel report by the Office for Budget Responsibility suggested that duty rises could return in September 2015 and rise in line with inflation from 2016 to 2019.

Relief: George Osborne announced he was scrapping the ‘trigger-point’ for automatically putting up duty

AA president Edmund King welcomed the confirmed April 2015 freeze but said the OBR report appeared to confirm the fears of 84 per cent of AA members in a recent poll who said they were concerned that motoring taxes would increase after next May’s general election.

Mr Osborne said he was ‘freezing fuel duty to help hardworking people be more financially secure’.

He added: ‘Action on fuel duty since 2011 will save a typical motorist £675 by the end of 2015-16.’

However, the OBR report said: ‘The next duty rate rise, planned for September 2015, means that receipts are expected to increase by 0.3 per cent in 2015-16.

Sceptical: Motorists fear rises in duty in the future

'From April 2016 onwards duty rate rises are assumed to be in line with RPI inflation, leading to receipts growth of 2.5 per cent on average between 2016-17 and 2019-20.’

Mr King said: ‘Today’s re-confirmation of a £15billion investment in UK roads and the continuing fuel duty freeze puts drivers on a “highway to hope” after some hellish years of high fuel prices, potholed roads and only patchy investment.

'But our members were right to be sceptical about future taxes.’

RAC Foundation director Professor Stephen Glaister said: ‘The Chancellor is pushing for more transparency in the pricing of airline tickets, so now he should also back our call for pump receipts to show how much of the price of petrol and diesel is tax.

'Currently well over 60 per cent goes to the Exchequer in the form of fuel duty and VAT.’

RAC chief engineer David Bizley said: ‘The negative impact of fuel duty on economic growth is now acknowledged by the Treasury. 

'With fuel duty already frozen until May 2015, we had feared an early return to the fuel duty escalator system – a deeply unpopular practice which led to a series of fuel duty hikes.

'But, for now, it appears that is not going to be the case.’

Howard Cox, founder of the FairFuelUK Campaign, said the government should investigate why pump price falls are not keeping pace with plummeting oil prices: ‘There should be 7p less showing at the pumps. Who is holding onto this profit?’

Motorway filling stations will soon have to post their prices in advance on roadside signs so motorists can see if there is cheaper fuel ahead.

Ministers were inspired by the system used in France where motorists can see the price of fuel at a variety of outlets on signposts (pictured) miles before they reach each service station. It is hoped the move will promote competition and lower fuel prices.

The signs will be tested at five service stations on the M5 between Bristol and Exeter, with a view to being introduced UK-wide by the end of 2015.

The RAC last month found motorway service stations charge 10p more a litre of petrol than the national average.
