A supply teacher at a Catholic school was marched off the premises after reportedly brandishing a knife during a lesson.

The male teacher was ordered off St Edmund Campion Catholic School's site a day after the incident in Erdington, Birmingham on Friday.

The school told him to leave after it was understood that he waved a covered blade in the air during a lesson involving Year 7 children, aged 11 and 12.

Shocking: The agency worker was told to leave the secondary school the morning after reportedly waving the blade in class

The exact details remained unclear but Birmingham City Council said an investigation had been launched.

West Midlands Police said the matter had not been reported to officers.

One parent whose child attends the school said she was 'stunned' at the news. 'The teacher was escorted from the school at 11am on Friday,' she said.

'The head was calling parents. I phoned the school because my daughter told me what happened.

'I was stunned and wanted to find out if it was true. The head called me back and confirmed there was an incident with a teacher.'

A school spokesman said the matter was being looked into, but refused to name the supply teaching agency the teacher worked for.

'Following an alleged incident reported, an agency teacher was asked to leave the premises and we have reported the matter to the agency,' the spokesman said. 'We have also contacted the local authority's Position of Trust team and they will be looking into it.'

A West Midlands Police spokesman said: 'No allegations have been reported to the police'.

The 1,000-pupil school was rated 'good' following a visit by Ofsted inspectors in November last year.

The watchdog said significant improvements had been made since the last inspection in March 2011, when inspectors found attainment was 'low, but improving'.

'St Edmund Campion Catholic School provides a good education for its students,' the report read.

'It is an inclusive school; the care, welfare and personal development of its students are central to its vision.'
