Burger King is grappling with the trials and tribulations of social media after their Twitter account was hacked by a McDonald’s fan.

The branding of their Twitter page, which has more than 89,000 followers, has been changed to feature their rival’s food and even their logo and Twitter name have been changed, appearing as McDonalds @BurgerKing.

The first sign of trouble was a post made from the official Burger King account stating: ‘We just got sold to McDonalds! Look for McDonalds in a hood near you.’

The Burger King Twitter account has been suspended after several posts, some racist and offensive, were made by the McDonald's fan over several hours.

'Whopper flopped': Burger King's Twitter account has been hacked by a McDonald's fan who has changed the branding of their page to feature McDonald's food, their logo and their name

From the Burger King account, the hacker promoted McDonald's food, posting: 'Try our new BK (sm) Bath Salt! 99% Pure MDPV! Buy a Big Mac, get a gram free!'

Since then there has been a string of Tweets from several Twitter users as news of the hack went viral with many tweeting and re-tweeting posts from the hacker.

One Twitter user wrote: ‘Somebody needs to tell Burgerking that 'whopper123' isn't a secure password.’

Another wrote: ‘Yo @burgerking I tried ordering a Bic Mac at the drive through and got laughed at :( #specialsauce’

A Burger King spokesperson told MailOnline tonight: 'It has come to our attention that the Twitter account of BURGER KING® brand has been hacked. 

Promoting their rival: From the hacked Burger King account, posts such as this one have been posted today, promoting McDonald's food

'We have worked directly with 
administrators to suspend the account until we are able to re-establish 
our legitimate site and authentic postings. 

'We apologise to our followers who 
have been receiving erroneous tweets about other members of our industry
and additional inappropriate topics.'

McDonald's denied any involvement in 
the hacking, posting on their Twitter page at 6.45pm: 'We empathize with
our @BurgerKing counterparts. Rest assured, we had nothing to do with 
the hacking.'

Some Twitter users mused over how the official Burger King account could have been hacked.

One wrote: ‘The fact that @BurgerKing got hacked and turned into a @McDonalds feed is pretty funny. Never know what is going to happen in social media.’

Another said: ‘We're guessing the @BurgerKing social media team is having a bad day...’

Twitter and Burger King are yet to make any official statements about the incident.
