Parents can rely too much on technology to entertain children these days so a mother-of-two has published a book on how to get your kids back to the good old-fashioned way of playing - by using their imagination.

Photographer Neva Elliott knows all too well how easy it is to plonk your kids in front of the TV with the busy schedule she leads with her four-year-old daughter, Josie, and two-year-old son Ryan.

But the Gold Coast woman wanted her kids to experience the imaginative play that she enjoyed throughout her childhood and says her family now lives in a more harmonious household.

'The whole atmosphere at home has changed I've seen my children so much happier - they are eating and sleeping better because they are more active,' she said.

The Busy Little Kids book, which was first released as an app for parents, gives you 123 tips how to encourage imaginative play including making daisy chains, pet rocks, mud pies and cubby forts.

'I thought the playing side of things came easily to children before I had kids but when I became a parent I found myself turning the TV on too often,' she said. 

'They need to look, listen, touch, feel and taste things and I think watching TV is such a passive form of entertainment that they really don't learn much about the world - they learn through tangible types of things.' 

But this is not to say that the TV never goes on in the Elliott home.

'They still watch it occasionally - just not as much as they used to,' she said.

'It takes a little bit more effort to get them to do imaginative sorts of things but it's just a habit that you have to get into.'

Neva's mother's words of wisdom have always stayed with her since she was a little girl: 'Teach to entertain yourself and you have a friend for life.'

10 WAYS TO GET YOUR KIDS OUTDOORS THIS SUMMER

DINOSAUR DIG

Put on your overalls and helmet because it’s time to go digging. Hide a few toy dinosaurs around the yard, in the sandpit or at the beach, then grab a bucket and spade and start searching. Chicken bones make great pretend dinosaur fossils so your children will feel like real life archaeologists.

PET ROCKS

This one is so popular, Time Magazine named it one of the top 10 toy crazes of all time. Pet rocks originated back in the 1970's but they’re still just as fun today! Simply find a rock, give it a name, draw on a face and voila, you have your very own pet. Better yet, it doesn't need walking or feeding. If you want to be really creative you can use stick on eyes, felt ears and glitter pens, your child's imagination is the limit.

ICE CUBE PAINTING

This one can get a little messy but it’s lots of fun for kids. Add a few drops of different food colouring to water in an ice cube tray and freeze. A few hours later you’ll have some ‘water crayons’ that are perfect for drawing on paper as they melt. You could even try freezing paddle pop sticks into the ice cubes to help with painting. A wonderful summertime activity.

CAR WASHING

Anything involving water is fun, especially on a warm sunny day. Grab a bucket of soapy water and a sponge, and get to work on making those toy trucks and cars shine. The older children can even help wash the family car.

LEMONADE STAND

Lemons, cold water, sugar and crushed ice is all you need to make the perfect lemonade. If you want to be extra creative you could add oranges and make orangeade. Once it tastes perfect, set up a lemonade stand or even host a lemonade party for all your teddies.

CLOUD SHAPES

Pick a day when there are plenty of fluffy clouds around and find a comfy place to lie with your child. Point out all the shapes you see and watch how they move and change with the wind. Can you spot a monkey, a giant crocodile, or a fire-breathing dragon?

READING AT DUSK

Let your child choose a few of their favourite books and head outside with a rug. Set yourselves up under a tree or umbrella in your backyard or patio. This will give them an entirely different experience to the usual bedtime story. If you’re feeling especially creative, a few fairy lights will make the atmosphere even more enchanting.

BACKYARD COOKING

Using sand, water, shells, straw and herbs from the garden, set up your own little outdoor kitchen. Children love playing with all the different textures, and you can use anything you have available. Add a few cups, spoons and a saucepan and you can look forward to some tasty mud pie or leaf soup for dinner.. Delish!

MAGIC WANDS

Did you know you can find the perfect magic wand in your garden? You can search the yard together to find one, or surprise your child with these - perhaps a fairy or a wizard left these in the yard for them? Once you find the perfect one you can make some magic; maybe you can make flowers grow or get the garden ants to walk in a straight line. Hours of enjoyment, so easy and completely free.
