Manchester United may be struggling for form in the Premier League, but star signing Angel di Maria looked to be planning a party this weekend.

The Argentine winger was spotted buying a bevy of fizzy drinks on Monday as he loaded his Waitrose shopping trolley with a range of liquids.

Di Maria - who earns a £200,000-a-week salary at Old Trafford - was out shopping with his wife Jorgelina Cardoso in Cheshire as he purchased gallons of soft and alcoholic beverages including Fanta, Sprite, Coca-Cola and 12 bottles of popular Mexican lager Corona Extra.

It wasn't all beer and fizzy drinks for the 26-year-old, however, as Di Maria also spent time perusing the vegetable aisle, where he picked up two bags of green salad.

Despite the large number of carbonated drinks, United boss Louis van Gaal will have been pleased to see his main man pack a packet of frozen prawns into his trolley as well as he looks to stay in shape for the visit of Crystal Palace on Saturday.

The former Real Madrid star also picked up a pack of 10 Diet Coca-Cola cans to add to his his trolley load of multi-pack items. 

Di Maria will be hoping to help his team to a much-needed victory on Saturday following last weekend's 1-0 defeat at the hands of rivals Manchester City. 

The Manchester United midfielder was also sure to pick up three large bottles of Evian still water

The Etihad clash saw Van Gaal's defensive injury woes worsen as Chris Smalling was sent off while Marcos Rojo was forced off after dislocating his shoulder.

Returning midfielder Michael Carrick could be in line for a start at centre back as Van Gaal looks to add some experience to his backline.

‘You have to adapt,’ said the England midfielder recently. ‘There are different jobs to do in certain games, different formations that you have to adapt to. That is not something that bothers me. I could do without centre-half at times, especially against Andy Carroll, but that is something you have to live with.’

The Argentine winger has scored three goals so far this season and has been a shining light for Louis van Gaal

Last month, Liverpool striker Daniel Sturridge posted a snap of himself at Sainsbury's with a host of goods picked up in a late-night supermarket sweep.

But how does his list compare to Di Maria's haul?
