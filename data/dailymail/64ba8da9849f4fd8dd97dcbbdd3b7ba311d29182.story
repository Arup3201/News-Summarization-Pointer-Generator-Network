A Romanian actress and TV presenter has been arrested after allegedly trying to blackmail a doctor into giving her a free boob job.

Oana Zavoranu, 40, had already paid for seven breast operations from Dr Marek Valcu at his clinic in Bucharest, Romania, but became upset after she thought he was conning her.

She allegedly began messaging the doctor, demanding £7,000 and another surgery for free, after becoming convinced he had used taxpayer money meant for burn victims to fund her operation.

Oana Zavoranu, 40, allegedly tried to blackmail her plastic surgeon, Dr Marek Valcu, into giving her free breast implants and £7,000 despite already having seven operations

Zavoranu had already undergone seven surgeries at the clinic, but after becoming unhappy with the results of the latest operation, began making threats

Zavoranu also believed that Dr Valcu had used state hospital facilities for her surgery, then billed her for the cost.

Many Romanian medics work in both private and public health, and there are often allegations that medics use state operating rooms and medicine to treat private patients, then bill private clients for their use.

Yet instead of reporting it to police, she contacted the doctor directly and demanded that he pay her money to keep quiet and carry out another boob job.

He in turn reported that she was trying to blackmail him to police and officers set up a sting operation that resulted in her being arrested as the cash was handed over.

'She texted him to say that she was unhappy with her last boob job,' said a police spokesman.

'The message was quite threatening, asking for another breast implant job and cash to boot. She threatened to reveal "compromising information" about him if he did not pay up.

Police say Zavoranu threatened to reveal Dr Valcu was using money for burn victims to fund plastic surgery

Dr Valcu tipped off the police and when Zavoranu turned up to collect the cash she was arrested

'She claimed that the clinic was using funds meant for burns victims but we have no evidence of this.

'She said she could prove his involvement in an illegal plastic surgery network.'

Police in Bucharest did recently arrest medical staff at the Burns Hospital on suspicion of using state money for breast implants, but have not found any evidence against Dr Valcu.

Dr Valcu added: 'She counted the money, took it and put it on the back seat of her car. I gave her the full amount, otherwise the police set-up would not have had anything to arrest her for.'

The police spokesman added. 'She is being questioned and a report is 
being prepared that will be handed to prosecutors who will decide how to
 proceed.

'If she has any evidence to back up her claims they will be 
considered. For the moment, she is remaining in investigative custody.'

Police did investigate a Romanian hospital for using money for burn victims to fund cosmetic surgery, but Dr Valcu was not involved in the scandal
