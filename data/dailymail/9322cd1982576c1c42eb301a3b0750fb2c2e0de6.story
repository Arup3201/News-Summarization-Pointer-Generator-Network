Australia may be a country filled with amazing natural beauty, but when it comes to some of its man-made efforts, the words ‘could do better’ suddenly spring to mind.

However, now that one of Brisbane’s biggest eyesores is about to disappear from the city’s skyline, with Roma Street’s Brisbane Transit Centre to be ­demolished to make way for the redesigned Bus and Train tunnel, why should we stop here? 

It's a progressive step and one that could help other cities take a similar initiative. Many other buildings around the country are in bad need of an update, or perhaps being replaced too.

Brisbane Transit Centre is to be ­demolished and it won't be missed, Transport Minister Scott Emerson said 

The Courier Mail reported that a new, modern transit centre will be built in place of the transit centre, following a fresh proposal for the BaT tunnel that would have it constructed below the site instead of beside Roma Street Parkland. 

Transport Minister Scott Emerson said the transit centre, often voted one of Brisbane’s ugliest buildings, would not be missed and we now had a chance to build an ‘iconic gateway’ to the city. 

In 2012 The Pixel building in Melbourne was named among the world’s top 10 building eyesores by travel website Trippy.com and Reuters. 

An architectural guinea pig in carbon neutral designs, the building stands out with its quirky design featuring what appear to be shards of glass in bright colours, news.com.au said. It’s not the only building in Melbourne deemed 'ugly' either, with Federation Square named among the world’s top 10 ugliest buildings by travel site Virtual Tourist in 2009.

A review of the building found it: ‘Frenzied and overly complicated, the chaotic feel of the complex is made worse by a web of unsightly wires from which overhead lights dangle.’

Parliament House in Adelaide has been called  odd, awkward and inelegant by some architects. It's a building that would fit in perfectly into a gothic horror film.

A Guardian city review of Perth said its urban sprawl is considered one of the worst in the world, due to the unfortunate tendency to build out rather than up, and the fact western Australians are loath to give up their three-car garages.

Perth Convention and Exhibition Centre has its fair share of critics

The Telstra Exchange in Perth has not proved to be a very popular design with locals

‘Many would call the Perth Arena the worst building in Perth,’ the review states. ‘I guess I get it – it’s misshapen and angular. It resembles a teenager who hasn’t grown into his body and is all elbows and knees.’

In a poll taken by PerthNow readers the search for our city's most unsightly building was a close race but three stood out in the minds of.

After more than 10,000 votes were cast, the Perth Arena finished just ahead of the Perth Convention and Entertainment Centre and the Telstra Exchange.

Perth Arena grabbed more than 28 per cent of the vote, while the PCEC (24.8 per cent) had edged ahead of the Telstra Exchange (23.1 per cent).

The Telstra Building at the Gabba in Brisbane has had its fair share of criticism

Stockland House in Sydney is the head office of Stockland, one of Australia's largest property groups

Sydney’s Meriton Tower has balconies that critics say don't work aesthetically

Meanwhile the Telstra Building at the Gabba in Brisbane was described by one architecture blogger as ‘a disgrace and the planner who allowed it to go there should be charged for crimes against humanity.’ 

In listing Sydney’s worst buildings, the Sydney Morning Herald plumped for Stockland House on Pitt Street. It’s the head office of Stockland, one of Australia's largest property groups. Faults include its pink marble facade, the car park entrance that destroys the footpath, and two ‘nasty’ pedestrian bridges.

Sydney’s Meriton Tower was also described as Harry Seidler's ‘worst’ building, with balconies that don't work and an awkward pedestrian entrance canopy on George Street. 

Even the Australia War Annex in Canberra has had its detractors in the past

The Herald report also reserved a special mention for The Star in Pyrmont. Describing it as rude and greedy 'wall' that blocks the harbour, trashes streetscapes and is unfriendly upon entry.  

In the Brutalist Buildings in Canberra blog the Australia War Annex in Canberra also came in for some criticism.

While not to be outdone, the Edmund Barton Building in Canberra, has divided opinions. It is a building that is loved by some for its modernist architecture, but to others it is just a concrete eyesore.

Its concrete 'silos', joined by horizontal columns studded with steel buttons, have polarised the Canberra community for decades.
