Parents are putting their children at risk by ‘conniving’ with them to get on Facebook, David Cameron’s adviser on family issues has warned.

Reg Bailey, the chief executive of the Mothers’ Union, attacked the ‘complicity of parents’ who allow their young children to use social networking sites which are supposed to be for the over-13s.

It has led to the alarming situation where about 60 per cent of nine to 12-year-olds have a social media presence, putting them in danger of being groomed by paedophiles or targeted with inappropriate advertising.

Mr Bailey, who wrote a high-profile report on the sexualisation of children for the Prime Minister in 2011, said he was worried about the example such parents were  setting about ‘honesty’.

It came as a survey of more than 2,000 parents showed that 34 per cent do not believe it is their responsibility to teach their children about being safe online.

The report, by Plymouth University and technology firm AVG,  also indicated that parents are in the dark about what their teenage children get up to online.

Some 85 per cent said their children had not looked at porn online, even though NSPCC evidence shows the majority of 14-year-old boys have accessed such content.

Mr Bailey made his hard-hitting comments at a summit on child internet safety in London which was sponsored by Disney – after both Google and Facebook declined to take part.

The Mothers’ Union boss said: ‘One of the problems I have is with the complicity of parents.

'With social networking sites, the minimum age is 13, and yet getting on for 60 per cent of children under the age of 13 have a social network presence.

'This is sometimes with the tacit acceptance of parents and sometimes the active connivance of their parents. It worries me about what sort of message you’re sending children about honesty.’ 

Mr Bailey told the Mail that many parents let their children go on Facebook and other sites because their friends are on them and they do not want them to get left out.

‘The problem with this is that if the child is eight years old but they claim to be 13 to get online, the site is constantly assuming they are five years older than they are,’ said Mr Bailey.

‘So when they get to 13, the site is assuming they are 18 and can then be targeted with advertising aimed at 18-year-olds, including gambling sites, drink and so on.’

The summit at London’s QE2 Conference Centre was sponsored by Disney’s Club Penguin, an internet site used by more than 1million children each month.

But conference producer Aisha Tilstone said Facebook and Google declined an offer to sponsor the event or take part.

She said: ‘We struggled to secure sponsorship from Facebook and Google for the summit, despite telling them they would be communicating directly to teachers and parents. For me, their lack of representation speaks volumes.’ 

Lucy Woodward, head of Club Penguin in Europe, said: ‘For parents, internet safety needs to be one of those life skills they need to pass on to their children, like teaching them to cross the road.’
