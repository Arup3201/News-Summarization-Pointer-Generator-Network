She runs her own fashion blog and has an impeccable sense of style so it made sense for Tu at Sainsbury's to call on Louise Redknapp to style and model her top ten looks for its 10th anniversary.

To celebrate a decade since its launch in 2004, the label worked with singer and TV presenter Louise, to style her favourite looks from the anniversary collection. 

Speaking to MailOnline about her latest project, fashion fan Louise said: 'I love fashion and I'm trying to do more style based work so it was perfect timing for me and I was really honoured to be asked.'

Fashionista: Louise Redknapp, who runs her own style blog, has styled and modelled Tu at Sainsbury's 10th anniversary range and says she loves this calf length skirt because it is 'really contemporary' 

The mother-of-two, who runs her 'passion project' - a blog called A Style Album with her girlfriends -added: 'I am a mum and I know I'm not young anymore but I've found what style works for me.

'I've been in the industry for so long that I've picked up tips from stylists along the way. I used to be so caught up in the pop industry and back then, it was all about stage-led outfits but fashion is more accessible now.'

Louise, who loves to mix classic items that work season on season with the latest trends, wanted to style fashionable but wearable outfits from the range.

Laid-back style: The former Eternal girl group member says she prefers the casual look and is a huge fan of sharp tailoring, nicely cut coats and sexy kick heels

The range takes lead from this season's catwalk trends, featuring folk-inspired pieces, bold autumn brights and prints, alongside 1960s silhouettes such as the A-line skirt and tunic. Louise styled these statement pieces with seasonal staples to create what she believes to be the ten must-have looks for autumn.

'These are quite catwalk-led looks that you can recycle and wear with anything. There's a great leather skirt, mohair jumper and big knits; it's all what's happening right now in the world of fashion,' she said.

Love for fashion: She and husband Jamie Redknapp share a passion for fashion and he appreciates the stylish and often expensive clothes she buys

Comeback? Louise has been toying with the idea of getting back in the studio after launching her pop career over twenty years ago with girl group Eternal 

One person who really appreciates her passion for fashion is her ex-footballer husband Jamie.

'My friends' husbands all say to them "how much?!" when they buy new clothes but Jamie gets it. He's really into fashion so I'm lucky and my friends are envious.'

Aside from her fashion and styling duties, Louise runs a successful organic make-up company with her make-up artist friend, Kim Jacob. 

Speaking about the range, which has won countless organic beauty awards, Louise said: 'I've been harping on about the power of natural make-up for years and people are finally getting into it now.

'People don't think about the goodness that can go into make-up.'

While she's big on organic skincare, you won't find her slurping on a spirulina smoothie any time soon.

'I'm low maintenance, I don't take any supplements but I do eat well,' she said of her diet. 'I don't cut everything out and I do like a drink occasionally.'

When it comes to exercise, the trim star says she isn't into 'faddy stuff' and does 'a bit' of exercise when she has the time in between blogging.

Despite her already hectic schedule,Louise has even been toying with the idea of getting back in the studio after launching her pop career over twenty years ago.

'I've been into the studio for a chat but there's no definite plans but we will wait and see what happens.' 

Fashionable family: Louise is married to football pundit Jamie Redknapp and says he is good at styling himself
