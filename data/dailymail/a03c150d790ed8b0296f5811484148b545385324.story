Thief: Daphne Whited stole Christmas decorations and lights from front gardens in Florida

A Christmas decoration thief has been outed on Facebook after a man offered to help her load the stolen goods into her car before taking her photo.

Daphne Whited, 44, drove around a neighbourhood in Florida stealing festive lights and decorations from front gardens.

She stashed the goods into the back of her waiting vehicle, before driving to her next target.

However, she was caught red-handed after resident Sean Young spotted her stealing decorations from his garden in the Tributary Street neighbourhood in Pensacola, Escambia.

Mr Young offered to help Whited load the festive goods into her car before taking out a camera and snapping her photo.

He then uploaded the image to Facebook in a bid to identify the thief, reported NorthEscambia.com.

'I asked her if she needed help putting my stuff in her car,' Mr Young wrote on the social-networking site. 'Then I took her picture.'

Whited was later arrested by police and charged with multiple counts of petit larceny and possession of marijuana.

She was found to have stolen decorations from a number of houses, according to the Escambia County Sheriff's Office.

Whited blamed her actions on a Craigslist advert claiming the posting said the decorations were 'free for the taking'.

She was later released from Escambia County Jail on a $1,000 (Â£611) bond while the stolen decorations were returned to their rightful owners.

It isn't the first time a 'real-life Grinch' has been caught red-handed stealing Christmas decorations.

Earlier this month, a thief stole a Santa figure from the front garden of an elderly couple in Inverurie, Aberdeenshire.

Kathy and Alistair Cowell were devastated when they spotted the criminal dragging the prized decoration into a car before speeding off.

However, the thief later returned the prized decoration with a guilt-ridden apology from 'the guy who stole your Santa', according to the Daily Mirror.
