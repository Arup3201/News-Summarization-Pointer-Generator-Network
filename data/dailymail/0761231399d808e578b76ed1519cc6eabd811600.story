Floating away on a boat and leaving the world behind is at the top of many holidaymakers' wish list.

Well now visitors to England can do just that.

A hotel is Surrey is the first outlet in the UK to offer the HotTug; a wood-fired hot tub which allows users to sail on a tug boat while simultaneously relaxing in a warm bubble bath.

Romantic escape: The HotTug is being advertised as the ideal retreat for couples who want to enjoy some alone with nothing but the lapping water for company

Going solo: Sailors can sit back and enjoy the peace and quiet while relaxing in the HotTug as it makes its way down the Thames

The brain child of Dutch designer Frank De Bruijn, the HotTug uses a specially developed wood-burning stove to keep the water a balmy 38C, and a silent electric engine to send a group of soakers merrily downstream.

De Bruijn says he has a soft spot for places where the natural and cultivated go hand in hand.

He says: ‘The feel of the outdoors is very important to me. Now the HotTug is expanding my work horizon to the water as well.’.

The 'tub' - which is available to rent from the Runnymede-on-Thames Hotel in Egham nestled on the banks of the River Thames - is ideal for care-free fun or simply relaxing in the summer sun.

Take a dip: The sturdy rim of the HotTug allows users to jump into the water during their ride - although that might not be advisable on London's River Thames

Full steam ahead: Group of friends can also enjoy drinks while sailing along in the hot tub boat

De Bruijn, continued: ‘It's much more than a boat, it's a vessel with different options.

'When the tug is filled, there is only a narrow rim between you and the water, making you feel at one with your surroundings.’

He gained experience of wood stoves while living and working on his own barge helped him to develop a wood-burning underwater stove. 

This underwater stove is what heats the 2,000 litres of water in the HotTug to a pleasant 38 degrees Celsius (100 degrees Fahrenheit) in a few hours.

We are sailing: Sailors might get some strange looks from people on board other vessels as they put down waterways

The HotTug proved a great success when it was introduced at the Hiswa boat show in Amsterdam in September. 

Now the company is exploring the possibilities of branching out as Bruijn aims big.

When asked what his idea of success is, he responded: ‘When the HotTug is a common sight at holiday homes, campsites and saunas around world.’

Prices start from £14,000 to buy or £90 per hour to rent.
