Lolita is a fashion subculture from Japan, influenced by clothing from the Victorian and Rococo eras

The style has no association with the book Lolita

The Japanese fashion subculture Lolita has made its way to Mexico, and the trend appears to be a hit.

The trend 
Lolita is often associated with Vladimir Nabokov's novel by the same 
name, referred to as cute, 'nymphet'-inspired styles in high fashion magazines.

However the Lolita style is influenced by clothing from the grand, but demure, Victorian and Rococo eras, its roots lying in modesty rather than promiscuity.

Its basic style consists of a buttoned up blouse, petticoat, bloomers, bell-shaped skirt, knee-high socks, and heavy make-up with an influence from Japan's Anime media.

Members of the Lolitas Paradise club in Monterrey are turning what was once a sporadic and limited style outside of Japan into a prominent fixture in South America.

A member of Lolitas Paradise club 
said: 'The goal of Lolita is not to create a sexy image but rather to 
maintain a cute or elegant appeal.

'The
 intention of Lolita fashion is for women to wear what makes them feel 
beautiful and dress for their own happiness, not for the approval of the
 opposite sex,' she added.

Ellie Frye, a 24-year-old Lolita 
reinforced this idea: 'It’s not, as some commentators have suggested, 
some sort of appeal to men’s expectation that women should be childlike,
 or an attempt to pander to pedophiles.

'Pedophiles
 like little girls. They don’t like grown women who happen to like 
dresses with cakes on them. I’ve never been hit on by a pedophile while 
in Lolita. We don’t get into it because it is some sort of misplaced 
pedo complex or anything, and the objective isn’t simply to emulate 
little girls, despite the name Lolita,' she explained to Jezebel.

The style, which emerged from the 
Japanese street fashion scene in the Nineties, has many incarnations and 
subsects, among them Elegant Gothic Lolitas, Erotic Lolitas, Gory 
Lolitas, Sweet Lolitas and White Lolitas.

While some Lolitas veer toward the 
goth influence with inky black garb, others emphasise a kitschy 
'cuteness' through pastel colors and pretty bows.

Major Japanese brands, like the 
Metamorphose temps de fille, Moi-même-Moitié, Angelic Pretty, and Baby 
The Stars Shine Bright started shipping Lolita products and goods to the
 international marketplace three years ago.

However, with the demand increasing, many non-Japanese designers are producing their own Lolita style and range of clothing, enabling pockets of the sub-culture to flourish outside of Japan.
