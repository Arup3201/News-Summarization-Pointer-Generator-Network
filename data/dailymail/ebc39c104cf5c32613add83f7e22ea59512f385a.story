News of a baby brings a much-needed boost for the Today show which is flagging in the ratings compared to ABC's Good Morning America.

Fueled by the Oscars, GMA is celebrating its most-watched week in nearly 23 years. The Nielsen company said last Thursday that ABC's morning show averaged 6.3 million viewers last week, the most since the company began keeping electronic records in 1991.

ABC's Monday telecast from Los Angeles the morning after the Academy Awards had nearly 7.2 million people watching the show.

The big week helped GMA regain some momentum from Today which had won their morning-show competition for two weeks during the Olympics. Nielsen said last week that GMA averaged 988,000 more viewers than Today.

Guthrie's baby news adds to the growing number of new moms on Today. It is the third baby in recent history of the morning show after correspondents Jenna Bush Hager and Jenna Wolfe.

Henry and Jenna Bush Hager announced on Today in December 2012 that they were expecting their first child. Their daughter, Margaret Laura 'Mila' Hager, was born on April 13 last year in New York City.

Jenna Wolfe announced on Today last March that she and lesbian partner NBC News Correspondent Stephanie Gosk were expecting a baby.

The couple's daughter Harper Estelle Wolfeld-Gosk was born on August 21, 2013.
