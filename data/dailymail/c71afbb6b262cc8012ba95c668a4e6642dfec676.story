Posing happily together for the camera a few weeks ago, this is the family whose lives ended in cold-blooded slaughter in their home.

Richard Smith stabbed his wife and two young children on the marital bed before starting a fire that killed him.

Detectives are probing the possibility that he had been having an affair and that this was a key factor behind the appalling multiple murders.

Smith, 37, is believed to have killed
his family in the early hours of Saturday after they all attended a 
function at the local cricket club.

He murdered wife Clair, 36, and 13-month-old Aaron with a single stab wound to the chest.

His other son Ben, nine, was also 
stabbed once in the chest but died from suffocation, possibly through a 
pillow being held to his face.

Smith stayed in the house for another 24 hours – even washing his car on Sunday morning – before taking his own life.

Tragic: Ben Smith, nine, was pictured in his local paper a month ago dressed up in a Pudsey Bear outift as part of a charity day alongside his classmates at Greenside Primary School in Pudsey, West Yorks

Yorkshire Police's Homicide and Major Enquiry Team, right, addresses the media this morning

Members of the public look at the tributes left at the police cordon in Pudsey, Leeds, where the four were found dead on Sunday afternoon

He put a mattress up against the 
window of the room in which he had killed his family, blocked the door 
and started a fire. He died from smoke inhalation, a post-mortem 
examination showed.

A neighbour raised the alarm after spotting the blackened bedroom window and phoned Smith’s brother Matthew.

They called the police and, accompanied by three officers, broke into the house and found the bodies at 5.30pm on Sunday.

Detective Superintendent Paul Taylor,
who is leading the investigation, refused to speculate on the motive, 
saying: ‘It will all come out in the fullness of time.

‘As we have previously stated we are 
not looking for anyone else in connection with this enquiry and our role
is to now establish the facts leading up to the tragic event that has 
ended the lives of four people and a seemingly happy family.

Tributes: The bouquets were laid outside the house which was cordoned off with police tape. The note on flowers is from friends Sara and Dean Turnbull

‘That information is then passed to the coroner, who will make a decision around the circumstances of the deaths.’

He said his thoughts were with family
and friends of the family, adding: ‘I cannot begin to imagine what they
have been through during the last 48 hours.’

Friends said the Smiths appeared to 
have had no problems. They moved to their £180,000 house in Pudsey, West
Yorkshire, last May, had no money issues and appeared happy after 13 
years of married life.

Investigation: Forensic teams work at the house today after the family was found in a bedroom on Sunday

Cul-de-sac: Police initially sealed off the house fearing a chemical leak

Smith was a designer for a shopfitting firm and his wife worked part-time as an accounts manager.

He was also the coach of the local 
under-nines football team that Ben played for and the whole family were 
at the team’s Christmas party on Friday evening.

Police have established there was no 
row or incident at the event, attended by 35 adults and 31 children at 
the Pudsey St Lawrence cricket ground. The Smiths left by taxi at 11pm –
the last time they were all seen alive.

Tragedy: Neighbours described Smith as a 'great guy' who appeared to have had no problems

Tragedy: The bodies of two adults and two boys were found in the property

The fact that Ben’s advent calendar had not been opened on Saturday was another sign as to when the murders happened.

Mr Taylor said: ‘We believe something
has happened overnight on Friday into the early hours of Saturday. If 
anyone else has any other information that contradicts that we very much
want to hear from them.’

Sealed off: Emergency workers in protective clothing prepare to enter the houseon Sunday night. Officers initially thought the family might have died as a result of carbon monoxide poisoning

Under watch: An officer guards the property in the aftermath of the grim discovery

The bodies were discovered at a property near the centre of Pudsey on the outskirts of Leeds

He said no note to explain the crime 
had been left in the house. Police are already focusing on Smith’s 
personal life to establish the motive.

Mrs Smith’s parents Alan and Norma Robinson paid tribute to their daughter in a statement.

It said: ‘Clair was an exceptional 
person, loving and caring to everyone. She was a loving mum, her 
children were her life, and everything centred around her family and 
home.

‘She was our daughter and our best 
pal. We cannot imagine what caused this tragedy.’ The Smiths suffered 
the heartbreak of losing a baby four years ago through a miscarriage at 
21 weeks.

But their sadness turned to joy when Aaron was born in November last year and they moved to a bigger house as a result.

Shelley Robson, 43, was Aaron’s 
childminder and had helped look after him since he was a young baby. She
said: ‘My heart has been ripped out by this. They were such a lovely 
family.

‘I know Richard and I don’t know what
has happened to make him flip and do that, to be honest I really feel 
for him. Something must have gone really wrong.’
