GOALKEEPER: PETER SCHMEICHEL

Has to be 'Big Pete.' What a fantastic goalkeeper, I played with David Seaman and he was a very good goalkeeper but for me Schmeichel was another level. Just the fact that, one on one's, normally when somebody goes through on the goalkeeper you just pray that they're going to save it but you just knew Schmeichel was going to save it, so we'd always set up a counter-attack because we knew he would. He could also throw the ball as far as he could kick it and the amount of times we would get get corners against us, he'd pluck it and release it to Giggs and Kanchelskis and we'd score goals. Best goalkeeper in the world during his time.

RIGHT BACK: JAVIER ZANETTI

He is a great player. Zanetti joined Inter Milan the same time as me and he was just awesome. He was just a young kid but he just slotted into the way we played. The reason I put him in ahead of Gary Neville is because Javier can play in different positions and I always want players who can be flexible and what ever position he played in - he was world class. He was unbelievable.

CENTRAL DEFENDER: TONY ADAMS

Colossus. Proper centre half. Men-of-men. In our England team we were all men, we were all big characters and big men but he was men-of-men. He was a leader and he inspired people around him. People say he wasn't the best passer but he wasn't that bad. His volley against Everton showed he could play. He wasn't the quickest but his timing of tackling. He was a brilliant organiser, he's top draw.

CENTRAL DEFENDER: GARY PALLISTER

Very unlucky to not play for England more. Laziest man you'll ever meet in football, if you did running he'd be at the back, when you finished training he'd be the first out of the door. I used to go round his house and he'd be playing on his PlayStation eating Malteasers. But when it came to playing football you would never see anyone go past him, you'd never see anyone beat him and he had telescopic legs, he was quick and he could play. The only negative is that he should have scored more goals but what a player.

LEFT BACK: ROBERTO CARLOS

When I first met him at Inter, I thought wow. Firstly, I couldn't believe how big his legs were, you can see that in the way he plays and strikes a ball. He had great pace up and down the line, he could tackle, score and he was an incredible player. The only thing that disappointed me was that Roy Hodgson let him go to Real Madrid a little bit early.

RIGHT WING: DAVID BECKHAM

An easy decision. Becks was the true professional, he was probably the best technical player I played with. I used to watch him and watch him. As soon as we'd finished [training], the mannequins would be out and he'd be taking free-kicks, corners and he'd do it for an hour. Every training session he'd give 110 per cent, he would never beat anybody but if you give him a yard, he'll put in the best balls you'll ever see. What a player.  

Ince described Beckham as the best technical player he played with during his footballing career

MIDFIELDER: ROY KEANE

For a complete player, without a doubt Keano. Apart from the bad side he had, he was the complete midfield player for me. He was an inspiration, a leader, could score you vital goals, he could tackle when he had too, he would be naughty when he had too but playing alongside him for three or four seasons helped him improve my game a lot.    

MIDFIELDER: PAUL GASCOIGNE

Probably the best player I played with. What more can I say? He's a maverick, he just had everything. He wasn't the quickest but he had that little injection of pace to get away from people and I remember seeing Gazza play for the first time at Upton Park and he was telling Billy Bonds to keep up. He's brilliant, scores all types of goals and without doubt the best player I played alongside.

Paul Gascoigne was highly praised by Ince and claims the former Newcastle man was the best he played with

LEFT WING: RYAN GIGGS

He would play 20 games and be unplayable, he was that good. If you're a full back and think get tight - then he'll spin inside, he you drop off then he will rip you apart. Outstanding player, what he's done in the game, his mindset when he played in centre midfielder for Manchester United for two or three years says it all. The best left winger there will ever be.  

STRIKER: ERIC CANTONA

Couldn't leave him out. When Cantona did come to United I knew that we'd win the title because he just had the aura and presence about him. He took the responsibility away from all of us lot. He was unbelievable, he'd come in at half past nine every morning, do his own warm-up and work on his skills, touch and his x, y and z. He was just brilliant. His goals and importance to the team make him an unbelievable player. 

STRIKER: ALAN SHEARER

When I think about a complete striker and what I'd want as a manager as my striker is Alan Shearer. It's not just the goals he scored, he was a handful, he could run the channels, his retention of the ball was fantastic and he was a leader of men. I don't think we'll have a striker in that mould again.
