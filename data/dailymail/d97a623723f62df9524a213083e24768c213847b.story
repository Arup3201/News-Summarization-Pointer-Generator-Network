A centuries-old secret  letter has been discovered under the floorboards of a former boarding school which featured in the works of Charles Dickens.

The 200-year-old note was uncovered as part of renovation works at the 16th century Eastgate House in Rochester, Kent.

Written in copper-plate handwriting, it is thought to have been sent by a former pupil at the Victorian girl's boarding school.

Addressing 'my dear little girl', the author- who signs their name simply as N Brunenell- appears to forgive the recipient for some long-forgotten upset. 

It was then stashed under the floorboards and forgotten for more than 200 years.

Built in the 16th century as a private home, the building has since been used as a Victorian boarding school, a young men's hostel, a restaurant and a museum.

My Dear little Girl,

I am very willing to excuse you. no my dear Girl I bear no Malice I will come present-ly and kiss you if that will do any good. Allow me to remain, my dear

Your Friend that you are

N Brunenell

Other theories surrounding the letter suggest it may be a love note from a resident to his sweetheart during the building's use as a  hostel.

But the Grade I listed building is most notable for its association with celebrated English writer Charles Dickens.

The Victorian social critic is likely to have visited the building which he featured as Westgate in The Pickwick Papers and as the Nun's House in The Mystery of Edwin Drood.

Most recently the historic property was used as a Dickens Museum and the famous Swiss chalet, where the writer penned several of his novels, was relocated from Gad's Hill in the 1960s.

A multi-million pound conservation project is under way to bring the building back into public use and create a community space with improved visitor facilities and access.

The letter is just one of many finds uncovered by contractors who are renovating town house in Rochester High Street.

Others include a toothbrush made of bone, a farthing dated 1923, a thimble and a gentleman's collar pin.

Site manager Jay Westwood, said everyday they were finding new historical treasures and described it as 'an honour to work on it.' 

Lawrence Best, contracts manager at Fairhurst Ward Abbotts added: 'This has already proved to be a fascinating project which will no doubt result in the discovery of further artefacts offering a glimpse into the building's rich history.

'Our experience of the heritage sector will ensure that any discoveries are protected and that Eastgate House is sympathetically conserved.

'This will include restoring many of the property's original historic features, such as decorative plaster ceilings, which will be returned to the way they were in the 16th century.

'We're proud to be involved in such an important project and look forward to providing a fantastic new community space and leading tourist attraction that will ensure Eastgate House remains a much loved part of the local community.'

Once work is complete at the historic house, it will re-open to the public in 2016 for the first time in more than 30 years, with exhibitions and displays telling the story of the building and those who have lived and worked there for more than 400 years.

The 16th century Eastgate House was built for Sir Peter Buck, Mayor of Medway

Eastgate House was built in the 1590s for Sir Peter Buck, Mayor of Medway and Clerk of the Cheque at Chatham Dockyard.

Five generations of the Buck family were associated with the house until 1687 where it passed into the hands of the Parkers, and later the Bartholomews.

In 1761 the house was held by Annabel Darwin, but possibly let to tenants.

It passed to James Reed in 1791 who is thought to have originally founded the school.

By 1841 it was under the governorship of Rebecca Norton and there were 14 boarders.

It was in this guise that Charles Dickens incorporated it - as 'The Nuns' House' - into his last, unfinished, novel The Mystery of Edwin Drood.

Eastgate House also features as The Westgate Seminary for Young Ladies in The Pickwick Papers.

Eastgate House once again became a private dwelling in the 1870s, being the home of Samuel Shaw, a wholesale coal merchant.

Its transition to a young men's hostel in 1890 appears to have been fairly brief as it had become a temperance restaurant by 1897 when Rochester City Council resolved to turn it into a municipal library and museum in celebration of Queen Victoria's Diamond Jubilee. 

In 1923 an extension to the museum, a new formal garden and a caretaker's cottage - 'Eastgate Cottage' - were added.

The Dickens Chalet was relocated here from Cobham Hall in 1961.

In 1979 the museum was moved to the Guildhall, and Eastgate House became the Dickens Centre, with displays devoted to the author's life and works. The Dickens Centre closed on 31st October 2004.

Work is now underway, with funding from the Heritage Lottery Fund, to transform the house into an exhibition centre for art and history events.
