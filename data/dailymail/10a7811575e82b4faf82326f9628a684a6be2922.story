Olympic swimming champion Grant Hackett is on his way to the United States to enter rehab over his addiction to the prescription drug Stilnox, Mail Online can exclusively reveal.

Hackett left Australia on Tuesday afternoon for America to undergo a treatment program for his addiction, following a bizarre incident in which he was filmed half-naked in an Australian hotel foyer.

The 33-year-old triple gold medal winning Olympian boarded the flight after a crisis meeting with his family on the Gold Coast.

The Australian flew to his parents, Margaret and Neill's Miami Beach home following the incident.

A spokesman for Hackett told Mail Online he was 'taking steps to seek help for a problem he has with Stilnox'.

'His family and friends are enormously proud of his courage in pursuing this course of action,' the spokesman said in a statement for Hackett

This is not the first time Hackett has battled an addiction to the prescription sleeping pill Stilnox and he had a 'heavy reliance' on the drug towards the end of his swimming career, Sydney's Daily Telegraph reported in 2012.

Hackett told the paper that he was first given the sleeping pills by swimming officials but overused them.

'At one point they scared me. They're evil', Hackett said in 2012.

Fellow Olympic swimmer, Michael Phelps, also admitted in the past to using Stilnox throughout his career and is popular with sporting professionals due to it's 'no hangover effect'.

Stilnox, a Zolpiem drug, is also used for anxiety but can be highly addictive if overused.

Side effects from the drug have been linked to strange behaviour, hallucinations, impaired judgement and delusions.

Stilnox is a Zolpidem drug, that is also sold under the brand name Ambien in the US.

It is a prescription anti-anxiety drug and sleeping pill that is given to patients to treat insomnia and anxiety.

Side effect can include hallucinations and amnesia.

There are more than 13 generic versions of Zolpidem, such as Ambien, Stilnox, Sublinox, Hypnogen and Zolsana.

In 2013 the FDA required the manufacturer of Ambien and Zolpimist to half the recommended dosage for women after studies linked it to car accidents from patients being too drowsy and next-morning impairments after taking the drug.

Hackett had also been taking Stilnox in 2011 and in 2012 to help him sleep while recovering from a shoulder injury at the time - the same year that he and his then-wife Candice Alley split

The couple separated in an ugly split which followed Hackett's trashing of their luxury  apartment  during Melbourne's 2011 Spring racing carnival in a wild drunken rampage which ended when eight police cars were called to the home.

Coupled with Hackett's confessions of a Stilnox addiction and alleged boozy behaviour at a television awards party, Hackett's behaviour has caused concern for the welfare of the dual Olympic gold medal winner.

Last month, it was revealed Hackett has found new love with Sydney model, Tahlia Giumelli, a onetime Miss Teen Australia who is 13 years his junior

Hackett has taken leave from his role as a relationships banker with Westpac Australia to seek treatment in the US for addiction and also visited his mother on the Gold Coast and aid with his father's post-operative recovery before his flight Stateside.

Following Hackett's apartment trashing incident three years ago, Neville Hackett said of his son, 'he's a dickhead, but I love him'.

At the time Hackett Sr dismissed reports his son had thrown Candice Alley against a window during the rampage.

'He may have wrecked the joint but he didn't harm anyone,' Neville Hackett said.

Hackett Sr is undergoing treatment following surgery to clear a blocked carotid artery, which put the retired policeman at risk of a stroke.

Grant, his manager Chris White, his brother Craig and Craig's wife Nicole gathered around Margaret on the Gold Coast yesterday for a family meeting.

This follows the latest bizarre incident involving the former swimmer and banking executive.

The Olympian was photographed wandering in the Crown casino foyer wearing a singlet over his underpants. Hackett reportedly wasn't thinking straight as he searched for his four-year-old son, Jagger, who had disappeared from their hotel room.

Hackett was driven by fear and panic when he realised his son had vanished.

The incident began in the early hours of Saturday morning, when Hackett was staying in a room at the casino with his twins, Jagger and Charlize.

In the middle of the night, Hackett was woken by a noise, which may have been the doorbell to his hotel room.

Daughter Charlize was beside him, but Jagger was nowhere to be seen. Panicked, and dressed only in underpants and singlet, Hackett removed his singlet, draped it around his underpants and grabbed Charlize under his right arm.

The pair took the elevator down to the foyer, which is where they were captured on the casino's CCTV security footage.

Unable to find Jagger, Hackett sought assistance from the night desk. The boy was eventually located, unharmed on another floor of the hotel.

Hackett regularly stays at the casino while visiting Melbourne for access visits to his children by estranged wife, Candice Alley.

Crown Casino has been contacted for comment over the foyer incident.
