Real Madrid midfielder James Rodriguez is available for Saturday's Club World Cup final against San Lorenzo but centre back Sergio Ramos needs a late fitness test, coach Carlo Ancelotti said on Friday.

Rodriguez has recovered from a calf injury that sidelined him for two weeks, while Ramos had to come off after an hour of the 4-0 semi-final win against Cruz Azul on Tuesday after picking up a thigh problem.

'There is no risk with (Rodriguez) as he has been training since Wednesday and he has recovered completely,' Ancelotti told a news conference previewing the clash between the European champions and the Argentine Copa Libertadores winners.

Ramos would train later on Friday and a decision would be taken on whether he is able to play depending on the advice of medical staff, Ancelotti added.

Real are seeking a Spanish record-extending 22nd consecutive win in all competitions against San Lorenzo and victory would add the Club World Cup to their 2014 Champions League, King's Cup and European Super Cup crowns.
