The parents of six children who died when their house was gutted by fire appeared in court this morning charged with their murder.

People in the public gallery shouted 'b******' and 'scum' as the charges were read to Mick and Mairead Philpott at Southern Derbyshire Magistrates’ Court, in Derby.

They face six counts of murder after prosecutors decided that pressing charges was ‘in the public interest’.

Family tragedy: Mick Philpott and his wife Mairead are charged with murdering six of their children

This morning, more than 20 friends and members of the family turned up at court, including one man believed to be Mr Philpott's brother.

During the 10-minute hearing a man and woman had to be led away by officers after the woman started shouting at the defendants.

Mr Philpott wore a white tank top and folded his arms throughout, while his wife wore a white sleeveless dress. He appeared to mouth the word 'w*****' at his abusers as he was led from the court.

There was no application for bail and the couple were remanded in custody to appear at Nottingham Crown Court tomorrow.

The Philpotts were taken into custody 
on Tuesday morning – a fortnight after they broke down in tears at a 
press conference as officers described the incident which claimed the 
lives of their children.

Jade Philpott, ten, and brothers 
John, nine, Jack, eight, Jesse, six, and Jayden, five, all died in the 
fire, while older brother Duwayne, 13, succumbed to his injuries in 
hospital three days later.

Their father had been hailed by neighbours as a hero for ‘valiant’ attempts to rescue his children.

After two days of questioning by police, the 55-year-old father and his wife, 31, were charged.

Officers had already established the 
blaze was deliberate, caused by petrol being ignited at the front of the
family’s three-bedroom council house in Allenton, Derby.

The Crown Prosecution Service said: ‘The evidence was reviewed by a Crown Advocate from the CPS East Midlands Complex Casework Unit, who decided that there was sufficient evidence to charge and that it is in the public interest for a prosecution to take place.’

Derbyshire Police assistant chief constable Steve Cotterill, who has led the investigation, said he was hopeful that more people from the local community would now come forward with information about the fire.

‘We are determined to get to the truth of what happened and still want people to speak to us to tell us what they know about this tragedy.’

The parents were arrested together in Derby city centre at 10am on Tuesday. Yesterday, police were given an extra 12 hours to question them at separate stations.

Mr Cotterill had earlier urged members of the local community to put aside allegiances and come forward if they have any information about the fire.

‘I appreciate that it will be difficult for some people but they should put their trust in us,’ he said. ‘My appeal is do not wait any longer – come forward now.’

The children were killed in the early hours of May 11 after the fire funnelled up the stairs and smoke filled the rooms where they were sleeping.

Philpott, a father of 17 by five women, became known as ‘Shameless Mick’ in 2007 after demanding a larger house to share with his wife, his girlfriend Lisa Willis, and eight of his offspring.

Funerals for the children are being arranged, funded by more than £10,000 already raised by the local community.
