An angry bank customer has been arrested for covering a woman in petrol and trying to set her on fire in chaotic scenes described as similar to a 'Quentin Tarantino movie'.

The dispute was triggered by a bank attendant's inability to unblock a customer's credit card when he urgently needed it to book a ticket to visit his son.

The customer allegedly returned to the bank in a rage, covered the attendant in petrol before trying to set her on fire.

A witness said the incident that erupted was like a scene from a 'Quentin Tarantino movie'

The man was trying to book tickets to visit his son with his blocked credit card when he became enraged

He left the bank and returned with matches, petrol and a hand grenade

Bank clerk Svetlana Zhigudova, 27, told the him red tape meant his card remained blocked and the issue was out of her hands.

He then stormed from the building, shouting: 'We'll settle this later, it's not over', before returning with a bottle of petrol, pouring the liquid over her and trying to ignite it.

The brazen attack occurred in the city of Belgorod, on the Russian side of the Ukranian border.

CCTV footage shows the attacker unable to reach the attendant with a match, but by grabbing a chair, he tries to climb over the counter to scramble after her.

Another employee of the bank pushed the panic button and police arrived, detaining the attacker following his attempt to pursue the staff member over the counter

The victim, who was covered in petrol, later said she thought she was going to die in the attack

'Now we'll see if I get my credit card or not,' he said.

Employee Galina Drekova, 34, pushed the panic button and police arrived to detain the attacker.

She said: 'It was like a scene from a Quentin 
Tarantino movie. Screaming, threats, panic - and this crazy old guy 
trying to set my friend on fire just because she couldn't unblock his 
credit card. If he had managed to get the match lit, she would be dead. 
She was drenched in petrol.'

Later 
Svetlana told police: 'I have never been so afraid in all my life. His 
card was blocked much higher up the chain and I told him there was 
nothing personal, but that I was not able to help him. He was completely
 unreasonable.

'When
 he threw the petrol on me it was surreal, at first I thought it was 
acid then I smelt the fumes and realised he was trying to set me on 
fire, I thought I was going to be burned to death.'

Mihail Tavroukin, 59, was arrested by police and could face life imprisonment.
