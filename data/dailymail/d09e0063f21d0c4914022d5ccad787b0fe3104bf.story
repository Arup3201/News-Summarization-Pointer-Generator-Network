Dog-lovers everywhere have been left outraged after video footage appeared online showing two council workers opening a yard gate and letting a dog run free.

Queensland’s Bundaberg Regional Council has been forced to apologise on behalf of their workers, after the video went viral around the world.

The video, which was posted to Sooty Daul’s Facebook page, has garnered over 240,000 views since it was uploaded on the social media site two days ago.

A video of council workers opening a gate and setting a dog free has gone viral, with many outraged at their actions

The footage clearly shows one worker entering the property, patting the dog and apparently stepping aside to let the animal past.

When the second man enters the yard he holds the gate open so the dog can gain access to the street.

In a Facebook post, Sooty Daul, who is believed to be the dog in question, warned other dog owners of misbehaving council workers.

“ALL DOG OWNERS beware of ‘council dog inspectors’ deliberately letting your beloved family pet out. I am requesting BRC supply a written apology and explanation for this behaviour & disciplinary action against this employee/contractor,” he said.

The men can clearly be seen opening the gate for the animal and patting him on the head before waving the dog on his way

Sooty the dog has taken to his Facebook page to let loose on the workers, telling other dog owners to watch out

When asked if the dog arrived home safely, Sooty reveals that the dog was safe but that he was nearly impounded.

“Sure is BS, Sooty is back home for now, almost got taken away by the pound (go figure),” the post said.

“I contacted BRC,their response at this stage was ‘call back tomorrow,’ they did make a very slow attempt to go after her once Danielle was informed, ‘your dog is out’,” the page said.

Bundabery Regional Council has apologised for the incident but has claimed that the dog was never in danger of being impounded

Speaking to the Courier Mail, local Peta Merritt said she witnessed the incident.

“I finished having a coffee with a friend and I noticed the same people at a property, (I) didn’t think much of it until the dog scooted out of the property and was running,” Mrs Merritt said.

“I nearly hit the dog and the car (in) front of me. I was distracted and couldn’t focus 100 per cent on driving; I’m still a little shooken (sic) up from the incident.”

The council worker seems to rethink his actions as the dog strolls out of the gate on to the busy street

Bundaberg Regional Council has responded to the incident, apologising to the owner and claiming they are ‘disappointed’ at the chain of events.

According to the council’s Health and Regulatory Services portfolio spokesperson, Cr Wayne Honor, thousands of properties were undergoing inspection that day.

The worker steps outside to see where the dog has gone but he doesn't go far. He then goes back inside and closes the gate

“I have seen the CCTV footage regarding this unfortunate incident but what the footage does not show is two members of our inspection team pursuing the dog almost immediately.

“Additionally, a Council Local Law Officer was called to assist and the dog was recovered very quickly,” Cr Honor said

Cr Honor said that the dog was never at risk of being impounded. He said the dog was unregistered and he has advised the owner to register the animal as soon as possible.

Members of the survey team had again been briefed by Council on the importance of ensuring their own safety and the security of animals located on private property.
