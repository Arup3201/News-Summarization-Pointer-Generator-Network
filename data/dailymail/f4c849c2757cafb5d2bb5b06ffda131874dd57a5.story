A tiny baby boy is flipped, twisted and spun around like a rag doll in shocking footage posted on the internet of 'child yoga.'

The horrifying video, posted on Facebook, shows the naked baby boy, who is just months old, being flipped over and swung in circles by a woman.

It is thought she is carrying out the controversial practice of 'baby yoga' which has been banned from a number of websites through fear it glorifies child abuse.

Horrifying: Swung around like a toy, a tiny baby boy is flipped, twisted and spun around in shocking footage of 'child yoga'

Concerning: The shocking video shows the naked baby boy, who is just months old, is flipped over and swung in circles by a woman

The baby appears visibly distressed and becomes redder and redder as a result of the horrific treatment.

The unknown Russian lady, who is smiling throughout, calls the child 'an idiot' and even asks him 'what's the matter' when he begins to cry.

Throughout the video she is heard to say: 'He wants me to do it. He wants it. The little idiot. He likes it like this.'

Cruel: The unknown Russian lady, who is smiling throughout, calls the child 'an idiot'' and even asks him 'what's the matter' when he begins to cry

She then asks the crying baby: 'What's the matter? Why are you crying?'

It is unclear if the video is fake or whether the child is actually real - but extreme baby yoga is said to be common in Eastern Russia.

The controversial practice has become highly popular in the country and many parents pay 'professionals' to administer the extreme yoga to their young children.

Sessions can often last up to five minutes and babies are spun, swung and flipped - often by a single limb.

It is believed it increases blood flow to the baby's joints and will make the child grow bigger and stronger than it normally would.

Yesterday Lana Wilson, who discovered the video on the social networking site, said she thought it was 'horrific beyond words'.

She said: 'I found a disgusting video on Facebook which is horrific beyond words.

'Many users have already been in contact with Facebook to remove said video but they deemed it non threatening and violent.

'Maybe they weren't watch the same video, but this is disgusting, these parents need to be locked up.

'I find it unbelievable that the video is still sitting there, it make me sick with horror just watching it.'

The video, called 'real baby swung 
around by mum', has 87,863 likes, been shared 6,987 times - but has also
 attracted 81,329 negative comments.

One
 disgusted viewer wrote: 'Only managed to watch a couple of seconds of 
this sick video! All the people involved in this need to be strung up!!

'Can't believe what I just witnessed, sick to the bottom of my stomach.'

Another
 wrote: 'This is an awful video and that is no mum who would do this to a
 new born baby. She needs locking up poor little fella. He just wants 
cuddles.'

Lena Fokina, who is not in the video but has become well known for practicing the bizarre routines, told reporters in an interview last year that the movements were designed to improve baby's muscular abilities.

The Russian said: 'The method was originally developed to cure and correct the health of children having muscular or skeletal problems but it is also suitable for healthy children.

'The movements are designed to improve their muscular abilities and development.

'And the children often turn out to be early readers, singers, talkers, swimmers. It also makes their hands stronger. We are humanists and we don't do anything wrong.'
