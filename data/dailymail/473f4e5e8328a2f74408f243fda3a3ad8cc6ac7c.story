Risks: Common allergy medicines have been found to cause memory and concentration problems in older people, researchers say. Picture posed by model

Allergy pills taken by thousands of Britons could be causing memory problems, researchers claim.

Common treatments including Benadryl for hayfever have been found to increase forgetfulness and concentration difficulties in pensioners.

Canadian scientists have also found a link with popular sleeping pills and antidepressants.

They are now urging doctors to consider whether their patients should really be taking these medications in light of the possible side-effects.

Although the researchers did not look at the risk of dementia, there is some evidence having mild memory problems makes you far more susceptible to the devastating illness.

Academics from Montreal University in Canada looked at 68 studies which had examined the potential health risks of certain medications.

They found that treatments for allergies, insomnia, depression and for overactive bladders were all linked to memory and concentration problems.

These drugs include Benadryl, for hayfever, benzodiazepines such as the sleeping pills diazepam and temazepam and the antidepressant  amitriptyline.

Lead researcher Dr Cara Tannenbaum warned that the potential effects of such drugs on memory problems, or cognitive decline, is ‘undervalued.’

She said: ‘Patients need this information so that they are more comfortable talking to their doctors and pharmacists about safer pharmacological or non-pharmacological treatment options.

‘Each individual has a right to make an informed choice based on preference and a thorough understanding of the effects the medications may have on their memory and function.’

The study, published in the journal Drugs and Aging, concluded: ‘Patients are increasingly concerned with perceived memory and attention deficits that may signal early dementia.

‘The impact of medications on cognitive function and their ability to affect the results of neuropsychological test scores during the clinical assessment of memory complaints is undervalued.

Recall: Having mild memory problems can make elderly people more susceptible to dementia, evidence suggests

‘There is a consistent body of evidence suggesting that drug-induced mild cognitive impairment can occur with episodic use of medications for insomnia, anxiety or allergy symptoms.’

Experts think the drugs interfere with chemicals in the brain called neurotransmitters, which are responsible for passing on messages.

This may result in forgetfulness, concentration problems and there is some evidence it leads to dementia.

Earlier this year Harvard researchers found that benzodiazepines increased the risk of developing the devastating illness by up to 50 per cent.

Most antihistamine tablets are sold over the counter and there are no figures for the numbers of patients currently using them.

But as many as 15 million Britons suffer from some form of allergy in their lives, including hayfever, although not all will seek treatment.

Figures also show that around 1.5 million are on sleeping pills and 6 million on antidepressants.
