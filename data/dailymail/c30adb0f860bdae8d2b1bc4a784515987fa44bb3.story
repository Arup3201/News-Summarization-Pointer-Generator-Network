Celebrity chef Raymond Blanc has been branded an ‘idiot’ for apparently revealing the winner of the Great British Bake Off on Twitter.

The 63-year-old Frenchman was criticised by viewers who said he had ‘ruined’ the BBC2 show ahead of tonight’s final.

He eventually apologised after he was publicly criticised by several current and former contestants, including this year’s favourite Ruby Tandoh – and then performed a U-turn and insisted he didn’t know who’d won after all.

It’s still unclear whether Mr Blanc 
does have any inside knowledge – but if you don’t want to risk him 
spoiling your enjoyment of tonight’s show, you might want to turn away now.

Mr Blanc kicked off the row by telling
his 84,868 Twitter followers: ‘The Great British Bake Off. Not much 
skills, female tears. And a winner so thin who makes me doubt her love 
for great cooking, baking.’ Within half an hour, the chef’s message had 
been retweeted more than 70 times.

Miss Tandoh, one of the three 
finalists, was quick to hit back, writing: ‘“female tears”?! and what 
has anyone’s size got to do with it? i don’t care if you’re a patisserie
king - don’t be an idiot.’

Many Twitter users assumed Mr Blanc’s 
message referred to the 21-year-old student and former model, who is the
slimmest contestant remaining in the competition and who has been 
criticised for a string of tearful performances.

Bake Off judge Paul Hollywood expressed his surprise in a sarcastic tweet of his own

‘Wow Raymond have you seen the winner already???’ he wrote.

However, show sources denied Mr Blanc 
had any access to the results and the chef, whose Oxfordshire restaurant
Le Manoir Aux Quat’Saisons has two Michelin stars, quickly backtracked,
blaming his poor English for the confusion.

He said: ‘Ok, sorry guys, I was a grumpy Frenchman this morning. I don’t know who has won #GBBO, but can’t wait to find out...’

He added: ‘It seems my tweet was not written how it was meant to. Frenchman writing English!

‘I’m sorry I do not know who the 
winner is. Apologies if I upset people this morning. I would like to 
congratulate you on a show. Best Rb xx’

Angry reaction: GBBO judge Paul Hollywood and finalist Ruby Tandoh hit back at the French chef on Twitter

The Bake Off final was filmed in June,
but contestants and production staff are under a strict contractual 
obligation to keep the winner’s identity a secret.

Yesterday, former contestant Mary-Ann 
Boermans – a finalist in 2011 – said: ‘I don’t know if he is just 
guessing or he does know but it is disappointing.

‘It takes the magic out it. The show 
is all about the excitement, and knowing spoils it. It is like someone 
saying Snape killed Dumbledore before you have read the [Harry Potter] 
book.’

Bookmaker William Hill has Miss Tandoh
as favourite to win tonight’s Bake Off, with Kimberley Wilson a close 
second and Frances Quinn an outsider at 6-1.
