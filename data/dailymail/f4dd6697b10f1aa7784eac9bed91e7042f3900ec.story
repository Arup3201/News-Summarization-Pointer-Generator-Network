Pepe Reina only completed his £2million switch to Bayern Munich on Friday, but already the former Liverpool goalkeeper has lined up in full kit for his new side.

But it wasn't for a competitive game, or even a pre-season friendly, it was for the club's official team photo where the German side proudly showed off three of the four trophies they won last term.

There was no room for the UEFA Super Cup, but Reina sat proudly in the first row just in front of the FIFA World Club Cup and the German league title, with the German Cup also featuring in the picture.

Let's get organised: The Bayern Munich squad hangs around during the photoshoot, with Reina looking on from the front row following his £2million switch from Liverpool

 

Reina is expected to play as understudy to Manuel Neuer for the German champions and he exchanged in brief conversation with the German World Cup winner shortly before the photo-call as he got to know his new team-mates - including fellow summer arrival Robert Lewandowski

It was all a bit much for Arjen Robben though, who rather than being excited for a new campaign following his dazzling World Cup displays for Holland, found himself looking rather bored and fed up with proceedings as he sat on the bench during the photoshoot.

Cheer up, Arjen. There's not long to go until the new season begins!

Reina sent a message to Liverpool fans after sealing his Munich switch.

In a letter headlined 'Once a Red Always a Red' the former Liverpool 'keeper addressed the fans and signed off with 'You'll Never Walk Alone, Pepe.'

He says that he knew his time at the club was over before the last campaign and updated the fans from a letter last year on what he called 'an honour and a priviledge.'

The move to Munich reunites Reina with his former captain at Barcelona, Pep Guardiola, and he says he wanted to enjoy his time with the German champions as much as his time at Liverpool.

Finally, he tells fans that he now counts himself as a Liverpudlian and he looks forward to returning to Anfield as a fan.
