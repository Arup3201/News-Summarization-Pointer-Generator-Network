A former Olympic gymnastics coach at a prominent California club has been permanently banned and kicked out of the sport's Hall of Fame after allegations of sexual abuse.

Don Peters, who coached the 1984 U.S. women's Olympic team, has been listed as 'permanently ineligible' for membership by USA Gymnastics, the nation's governing body of the sport.

The action means he can no longer work or volunteer at more than 2,000 member clubs across the country.

Allegations: Former Olympics gymnastics coach Don Peters, pictured in 1988, has been permanently banned from coaching

The investigation into the 62-year-old comes after newspaper The Orange County Register reported alleged sexual and physical abuse of underage gymnasts.

More than a dozen former gymnasts told the newspaper stories of abuse.

In a September 25 story, Doe Yamashiro, a former U.S. national team and SCATS member, said Peters began fondling her in 1986, when she was 16, and had sexual intercourse with her when she was 17.

As he looks today: Peters has been kicked out of the sport's hall of fame

Peters, who resigned from USA Gymnastics earlier this year, had argued that his banning was 'moot' because he had already relinquished his membership, and his attorney attacked the investigation, according to ABC news.

'The investigator hired by USA Gymnastics tainted and corrupted the interviews of the witnesses against Coach Peters,' attorney Kevin O'Connell claimed.Â 

USA Gymnastics is standing by the findings of its hearing panel, which essentially said it believes the allegations of the two now-adult women and decided Peters should be banned, reports ABC News.

'They can remove [Peters] from their corporate Hall of Fame,' Mr O'Connell added, 'but they cannot remove the gold medals from the team he coached'.

Peters led the U.S. women's team to a record eight medals in the 1984 Olympics.

The
alleged abuse took place in the 1980s and can not be prosecuted under 
California law because the statute of limitation has expired.

Two
other U.S. gymnastics coaches, Doug Boger and Michael Zapp, have either
been dismissed or terminated from coaching roles after allegations of 
sexual and physical abuse surfaced in newspapers.
