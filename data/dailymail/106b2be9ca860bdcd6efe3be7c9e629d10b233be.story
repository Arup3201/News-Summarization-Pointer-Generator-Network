With its carefully collated facts and figures, it reads like a set of company accounts.

But closer inspection of the 400-page document reveals it is a chilling breakdown of the murderous activities of the fanatics battling for control of Iraq.

For this is the 'annual report' of the Al Qaeda-inspired Islamic State of Iraq and Syria (ISIS), designed to demonstrate its power and attract funds from potential donors.

Like any corporate document, it uses computer-generated graphics, details a management strategy, lists performance and targets.

But the jihadists' statistics chart in numerical and geographical detail its lethal operations – bombings, assassinations, suicide missions and cities taken over.

In the latest edition of 'al-Naba' – the News –  covering the 12 months up to last November, ISIS claims to have carried out nearly 10,000 operations in Iraq. That includes 1,000 assassinations, planting more than 4,000 roadside bombs and freeing  hundreds of prisoners.

ISIS even records the number of people who renounced Islam then repented – and contains one sickening category headed 'apostates run over'.

The report, written in Arabic with a photograph of an ISIS gunman on its cover, has been analysed by the US think-tank, the Institute for the Study of War (ISW), which has corroborated much of the information. John Lawrence, of the Washington-based institute said: 'These numbers are not just purely propaganda figures.'

ISIS's aim appears to be to 
demonstrate its record to potential donors, and ISW says the annual 
report, the second published in as many years, destroys the myth that 
the insurgents are a rag-tag band of Islamist militants.

The
 ISW analysis portrays an organisation 'functioning as a military rather
 than a terrorist network' with a clear political strategy aimed to 
eventually set up a Sunni sectarian state run under harsh Sharia laws.

Jessica Lewis, director of research at the institute, told the Financial
 Times: 'The reports provide measures of performance in the way you roll
 out details for donors.

Numbers: Another set of graphics in the report shows the weaponry Isis now has in its possession

Isis claims in the 2013 report to have 15,000 fighters who have carried out 1,000 assassinations

'They
 affirm that the organisation operates like an army and that it has 
state-building ambitions.' The ISW study concludes: 'This is a military 
enemy that requires a considered strategy, military as well as involving
 anti-ISIS Sunni populations, to defeat it, or it will become a 
permanent fixture in the Middle East.'

The
 latest annual report does not include the ISIS fanatics' major gains in
 recent weeks, where they have swept through northern Iraq, carrying out
 summary executions. They are now battling government forces close to 
Baghdad.

This year has also
 been successful in financial terms for the terror group. Its fighters 
looted hundreds of millions of pounds from banks in Mosul, Iraq's second
 city which was over-run by ISIS last week.

Social media like this Twitter feed has played a huge role in recruiting members of Isis especially from overseas

According to the Council on 
Foreign Relations, ISIS was already extorting taxes from Mosul 
businesses before its takeover – to the tune of £4million a month.

In
 its 2013 document, ISIS says it took over eight cities, compared to one
 the previous year. The ISW warns that the number of attacks reported by
 ISIS may be exaggerated but month by month, area by area, the document 
reveals soaring levels of violence.

In
 2013, ISIS claims to have executed 1,083 people – almost double the 585
 in 2012. Mortar attacks jumped from 359 in 2012 to 607 last year and 
the number of houses burned or bombed rose from 648 to 1,015.

ISIS
 massively increased the use of suicide bombers – either wearing bomb 
vests or driving bomb-laden vehicles – to terrorise Iraqis, with a 
six-fold increase in the number of attacks to 238. Baghdad bore the 
brunt of suicide bombers, with an increase from seven to 81 murderous 
attacks in the capital.

Targeted
 killings jumped from 16 to 1,047 and are evidence of a disciplined 
shift in tactics and techniques by ISIS to wrest control of Iraq, says 
the ISW.
