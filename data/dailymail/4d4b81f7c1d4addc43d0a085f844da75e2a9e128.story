The husband and brother of a Staten Island woman are on a desperate mission to Turkey to try and find the mother-of-two after she failed to board a flight back to the U.S. several days ago.

Sarai Sierra, 33, a freelance photographer and mother to two young boys, left for Istanbul January 7, in part to indulge her passion for the medium, capturing the stunning scenery and architecture.

She was last in touch with her family on Monday, when she was supposed to begin her journey home.

Mrs Sierra was originally supposed to travel with a friend but when that fell through at the last minute, she chose to travel alone, marking her first solo trip overseas.

Without a trace: Sarai Sierra, a 33-year-old mother of two young sons, has not been heard from since January 21 after travelling alone in Turkey

Eye for detail: Mrs Sierra, a freelance photographer, had gone on the trip to snap photos of the ancient country

Contact: The last time her family heard from her was on January 21

Her husband, Steven Sierra, was waiting for hours at Newark Liberty International Airport in New Jersey on the 22nd to pick her up. Airline attendants in Turkey said that his wife did not show up for the flight.

‘We just want to find her and get her home safe,’ he told the Staten Island Advance from his home in the Silver Lake neighborhood of the borough yesterday.

The panicked husband also found out that his wife’s passport, clothes, phone chargers, and medical cards were found in her room at a hostel in Beyoglu, Turkey. The hostel’s owner told Turkish authorities that he had last seen her last Sunday night.

Mr Sierra told ABC News that her behavior is highly unusual, and that the mother to two preteen boys seemed perfectly content with her life, and going off the radar is extremely out-of-character for her.

He and Mrs Sierra’s brother, David Jimenaz, are scheduled to arrive in Turkey by Monday afternoon and will continue their search aided by local officials. They said that they will also look in hospitals to see if Mrs Sierra somehow sustained an injury and was unable to make contact with them.

The heartbroken husband said that he’s been married to her for more than 14 years, adding that his love for her is ‘deeper than it is for any individual.’

He told WABC: ‘You have so many thoughts going through your mind, you don’t know what to think, you don’t know what to believe, you don’t know what to expect, you don’t know what will come out of this.’

During her last few days in the Eurasian country, Mrs Sierra planned to head to the Galata Bridge, a well-known tourist destination that spans the Golden Horn waterway, to take some photographs, her mother, Betzaida Jimenez, told the Associated Press.

'You
have so many thoughts going through your mind, you don't know what to 
think, 
you don't know what will come out of this.'

Crime in Turkey is generally low and Istanbul is a relatively safe city for travelers, though there are areas where women would be advised to avoid going alone at night.

The Galata and the nearby Galata Bridge areas have been gentrified and are home to fish restaurants, cafes and boutiques.

The U.S. Consulate in Istanbul did not immediately return MailOnline's request for comment over the safety of the city for Western tourists or the status of the missing mother.

Sierra's children, aged 9 and 11, do not know their mother is missing, her brother said. Betzaida Jimenez said the situation has 'been a nightmare.'

'I'm forcing myself to get up because I have to get up,' she said.

The mother later told ABC News: 'My heart is broken,' saying that the doubt and uncertainty was causing tremendous amounts of stress on her and her family.

But she said the tight-knit family was holding onto their faith.

'We're praying and trusting God that she's safe somewhere and we're going to find her,' she said.

Mrs Sierra's friend, Magalena Rodriguez, told the New York Daily News that the petite woman, who stands at 5ft2in and weighs only 110 pounds, has fainted before without warning.

Ms Rodriguez fears her friend has fainted and could be hurt somewhere in the unfamiliar country.
