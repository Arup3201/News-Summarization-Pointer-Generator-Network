Rich foreigners should be restricted from buying houses in Britain and purchasing newbuild homes solely as an investment, a leading think-tank has said.

Wealthy overseas investors are adding to 'rampant house price inflation', driving up prices and forcing millions of middle and low UK earners out of the property market, Civitas has said.

The think-tank has called on ministers to adopt a scheme to stop existing homes being sold to those from outside the EU.

It also proposes foreigners should only be allowed to buy new homes if they prove their investment would lead to more properties being built.

It would therefore stop foreign investors such as Chelsea football club owner Roman Abramovich from adding to his multi-million pound collection of London homes.

Investment from China, Malaysia and Singapore will also be reduced under the plans, it is hoped.

The report, called Finding Shelter, revealed that 85 per cent of London homes in 2012 were bought by foreign investors. Two thirds of those were bought solely as investments and were not lived in.

Civitas says foreign buyers are not just acquiring high-value London properties - but also mid-market new homes.

They say 27 per cent of new builds in central London were bought by UK citizens, with more than half sold to those from Singapore, Hong Kong, China and Russia.

The report, to be release in full tomorrow, said: 'The UK property market is being use as an investment vehicle by the global super-rich - and increasingly the simply the well-to-do.

'It is good news for estate agents... But it is not good for those already being priced out at the bottom.

It added foreign investments are 'distorting housebuilding priorities with developers disproportionately attracted to high value developments while ignoring the under supply at lower levels of the market.'

The paper, co-written by director of 
Civitas David Green and director of communications at the body Daniel 
Bentley, added: 'London property is now seen for many in terms of its 
investment potential, as a safe haven for cash in an unstable global 
economic climate, rather than something that should be meeting a basic 
social need for the capital's residents.

'For too many it is providing financial shelter rather than human shelter.'

The restrictions are similar to a scheme currently in force in Australia, where all non-residents and holders of short-term visas  must apply to the country’s Foreign Investment Review Board (FIRB).

They cannot purchase an existing home - but can buy a new property provided they can satisfy the FIRB that the housing stock has increased.

Civitas says similar controls are used in Singapore, Switzerland and Denmark.

Shadow London minister Sadiq Khan told The Observer: 'London is in the middle of a severe housing crisis, yet there are around 50,000 empty homes.

'We must stop housing that's built as family homes being used instead as a piggy bank for the world's wealthiest people.'

Rather than blaming the property boom on foreign buyers, some analysts have criticised the Government's flagship Help to Buy scheme for pushing up demand in the housing market.

The scheme gives people with only low deposits saved a helping hand to get on to the property ladder.

They say this imbalance between demand and supply is fuelling an upward pressure on prices.

Recent
 Land Registry figures showed that house prices in London increased at 
more than double the rate of the rest of the UK over last year.

London house prices leapt by 11.2 per 
cent over 2013 to reach £403,792 on average, while prices across England
 and Wales generally lifted by 4.4 per cent in the 12 months to December
 to reach £167,353.
