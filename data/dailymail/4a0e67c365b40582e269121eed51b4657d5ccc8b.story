 A skydiver beat the sweltering summer heat by landing on a 200ft slip-n-slide.

Experienced jumper Niklas Daniel decided to cool off after leaping out of a DHC-6 Twin Otter as it cruised over Arizona, at 5,000ft.

The fearless parachuter made a near vertical descent as he approached the giant water slide - before landing perfectly on his bum to slide the full length at around 50mph.

Mr Daniel, who has over 8,000 jumps behind him and runs a flight school in the states, captured the entire jump on a GoPro attached to his helmet.

He said: 'The weather was very hot and we were trying to figure out a fun way to cool off in between jumps.

'It was a great way to end the day.'

Alongside fellow skydiver Brianne Thompson, the pair can be seen smiling at the camera as they wait their turn to jump

Showing no sign of nerves having completed nearly 20,000 jumps between them, the professional skydivers nonchalantly leap out - despite being just 5,000ft above the ground

The normal height for a skydive is roughly 13,000ft. It meant they had to pertorm a tricky 'hop and pop' routine where they immediately pull their parachute after free falling for only a few seconds.

The pair can be seen casually gliding towards an airstrip in the Arizona desert - where temperatures can rise as high as 45C

The scorching heat prompted the pair to set up the stunt in a bid to cool off after a packed day of teaching sky diving at their Axis Flight School

Niklas added: 'This type of landing has a higher risk associated with it because of the high decent rate and additional speed produced when diving the parachute.

'It is by no means a normal parachute landing and takes many thousands of jumps and years to learn.'
