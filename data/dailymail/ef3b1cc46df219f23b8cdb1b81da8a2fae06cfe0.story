Two alleged thieves carrying a stolen 17ft bright red canoe managed to trick police into letting them go - after telling them they were using it to go sledging.

It is understood police officers stopped the pair after a neighbour reported the theft from a garden in Edinburgh on Monday.

However, they were allowed to go on their way after the officers were assured they had been given permission to borrow the canoe to use on the snow.

Norman Maver said it was 'ridiculous' that the two alleged thieves were allowed to go on their way after telling officers they were using the canoe to go sledging

The 17ft red canoe was reported stolen from the garden in Edinburgh during a snow storm

The owner Norman Maver called the apparent misunderstanding ‘ridiculous’.

He said: ‘They came out responding to a call about a bright red, 17ft canoe that had been reported stolen.

‘It’s a hundredweight and usually takes a few people to shift it.

‘[My neighbour] called the police but when they arrived [they were told] they had permission to go sledging in it and that was that.

‘They just let them go on their way.

‘I don’t know about anyone else but I have never seen a 17ft canoe going sledging before. It’s insane.

‘For the police not even to take names when they are on a call about a stolen canoe is ridiculous.’

Mr Maver said the canoe has been stored in the same place for 30 years and has never been taken before

The father-of-two went to a police station the following day to file a report the theft where he discovered the incident had been dismissed as a misunderstanding.

Mr Maver said the canoe was ‘irreplaceable’ to him and had owned it for 30 years after being given it by an old friend.

The canoe was later recovered and Lothian and Borders Police said a 16-year-old boy had been arrested and charged in connection with the alleged theft.

The spokesman added: ‘He is scheduled to appear in court at a later date. The canoe has been recoved and will be returned to its owner.’

The canoe, which has now been recovered, was given to Mr Maver by an old friend and he said it is 'irreplaceable'

Mr Maver said: ‘It’s just so frustrating, it’s the sentimental value to me. I have no idea how much it’s actually worth. I did give it a new paint job though last summer, and that cost me £250.’

He said an inspector had visited him to apologise.

He said: ‘His exact words to me were “I’m here to eat humble pie”

‘I just can’t believe it happened. It’s just you couldn’t make it up.’
