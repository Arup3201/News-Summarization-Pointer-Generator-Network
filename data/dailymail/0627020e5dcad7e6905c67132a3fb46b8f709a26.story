If you thought your journey to work was bad this morning, think about the drivers crawling at less than one tenth of a mile an hour in rush-hour traffic.Â 

A new survey has revealed the worst of the snail-pace journeys in Britain are in London, while Manchester, Merseyside and Birmingham also have some of the slowest-moving roads.

Jamaica Road in Southwark, south London, was found to have the worst jams in the survey by GPS vehicle tracking supplier RAM Tracking.

Congestion: Jamaica Road in south London has the worst traffic jams in Britain

Those travelling along this route in Southwark averaged just 0.08 miles an hour between 8am and 9am in 
February 2013, the survey showed.

The next-worst congested route was the B221 Bedford Road in Clapham, south London, where traffic managed 0.13mph.

Third
equal in the slow-coach list was Greenhill Way in Harrow, north west 
London, and Queen Anne's Gate in Westminster, central London, with rates
of 0.25mph.

All the 10 
slowest-moving roads were in Greater London, while the worst route 
outside London was the A5081 Park Way in Trafford Park, 
Manchester, at 0.69mph.

This was followed by Skipton Road in Harrogate, North Yorkshire, at 1.50mph, and the B5145 Poulton Road in Wallasey on Merseyside at 1.76mph.

In the non-London list, Headington in Oxford appears twice in the top 20, while Birmingham has six of the 20 most-congested roads.

RAM Tracking managing director Chris McClellan said: 'Our findings have revealed what a phenomenal amount of time many business drivers waste when travelling during the breakfast rush hour.'

In addition to this data RAM has also collated the top five most congested motorways at morning rush hour.

They are the M6 at Ward End, West Midlands (27mph); M62 at Hunsworth, West Yorkshire (34mph); the M4 at Brentford (37mph); the M11 at Chigwell, Essex (38mph); and the M25 at Downside, Essex (38mph).

RAM Tracking has also developed an interactive map which shows drivers which roads are the slowest during rush hour.
