Members of the Dortmund squad took to social media on Tuesday to post pictures of the team making their way to London ahead of the Champions League clash with Arsenal.

Dortmund go into the match at the Emirates on Wednesday night with a perfect Champions League record, having already secured their place in the last 16 of the competition.

And, despite the club's woeful Bundesliga form that has left Jurgen Klopp's side 16th in the table, the squad looked in high spirits as they set off on their travels.

Manager Klopp, who continues to be touted as the man to replace Arsene Wenger at Arsenal, was pictured arriving at the airport with a winged rhino - said to represent the Dortmund concert house - on his luggage trolley.

Forward Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang had his photo taken in the cockpit with the pilots ahead of take off, and also shared a selfie with team-mate Milos Jojic after taking their seats on the plane.

Former Manchester United midfielder Shinji Kagawa, who rejoined Dortmund this summer after an unsuccessful spell at Old Trafford, got in on the act too as he posed with strikers Adrian Ramos and Ciro Immobile.

The Italian, who signed for the German outfit from Torino in the summer, was also pictured being greeted by Dortmund's mascot Emma the bee as he arrived at the airport.

Dortmund, coming off the back of a disappointing 2-2 draw with newly promoted Paderborn on Saturday, recorded a 2-0 win over Arsenal in the reverse fixture back in September.

The Germans pose a stern test for Arsene Wenger's side, who are yet to guarantee their progression form Group D after throwing away a three-goal lead to draw with Anderlecht in the last round of fixtures.
