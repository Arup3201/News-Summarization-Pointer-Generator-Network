A hospital boss embroiled in a cancer waiting time scandal was accused last night of  bullying staff.

Gordon Coutts, chief executive of the trust running Colchester General Hospital, was said to have presided over a culture obsessed with government targets.

His personal assistant Mandy Tapfield quit last month after 28 years at the hospital, claiming her ‘life was made hell’.

The 56-year-old, who was his executive PA until last month, claims she left because she could no longer tolerate Dr Coutts’s demands. Her husband Paul, 59, says she has reported the alleged bullying to health watchdog Monitor.

‘My wife had worked at the hospital for the past 28 years – for the past two years for Gordon Coutts,’ he said. ‘That guy made my wife’s life hell. His expectancy was that she would run his life for him and arrange everything.

‘He degraded her, he ran her down all the time. It got to the stage where he was telling her what time she had to go for her lunch.'

He said his wife contacted health union Unison and human resources before quitting last month. The mother of two has now taken a job in Lincolnshire.

Mr Tapfield criticised Dr Coutts for claiming he would not tolerate bullying by staff: ‘It is him that is the bully, and that comes from the top downwards. There is a cultural problem without a doubt. It can only come from the top.’

Police are examining a report by the Care Quality Commission saying officials were fiddling figures to make it seem the hospital was meeting guidelines for treating cancer patients. Thousands of patients may have been affected.

It has published claims that staff have been ‘pressured or bullied’ by managers to change cancer waiting times – potentially putting lives at risk.

Dr Coutts – in charge of the trust since 2010 and on £165,000 a year – held a widely discredited internal inquiry into the data fiddling claims in 2012.

He has also said the hospital ‘cannot accept and does not accept any kind of bullying’. The allegations however include that:

He sits on a board set up by Sir David last year as a centre of excellence for managers to develop ‘outstanding leadership in health’.

Colchester General Hospital is being investigated by police following a Care Quality Commission report saying officials were fiddling figures

Karen Webb, a regional director for the Royal College of Nursing, said: ‘For the last two or three years, Colchester has been a flashing red light on my dashboard.

‘We have been raising concerns over the culture of bullying at the hospital since 2011 – we have dealt with dozens of complaints from our nurses.’

Mrs Webb said it was easy to see how staff may have felt bullied or under pressure to change data, adding: ‘It is bullying, it is oppressive. It is about don’t speak up, don’t say anything, keep your head down and get on with it.’

She said she experienced such ‘intimidation’ first hand when Dr Coutts swore at her during a private meeting and told her twice to ‘shut up’, after she suggested cleaning cuts could be linked to a rise in the superbug Clostridium difficile.

Colchester Hospital University NHS foundation trust was under pressure to meet targets after being fined £16,000 in March last year.

North East Essex primary care trust penalised it for missing the 62-day deadline for two patients to receive initial treatment and a delayed consultation for a woman with ‘breast symptoms’.

In a letter to a colleague last week, a consultant at the hospital wrote: ‘The pressure on staff in the hospital has been absolutely awful over the last 2 years at all levels of the organisation’.

He also spoke of doctors ‘being badgered about cancer breaches by clerks in the cancer coding department’.

However, he accused the CQC of mounting a witch hunt against the trust.

A trust spokesman would not comment on the allegations that waiting times were fiddled because an independent investigation is underway. And he said discussing Mrs Tapfield would be a ‘breach of confidentiality’.

But he said Dr Coutts had not told Mrs Webb to shut up.

The trust insists that targets were not put ahead of patient safety.

Dr Coutts worked as a junior doctor before becoming an executive in the pharmaceutical industry and then returning to the NHS.

Health chiefs at Colchester Hospital repeatedly ignored allegations made by staff and patients that cancer waiting times were being manipulated.

At least six employees contacted senior managers or board members to complain about the practice since December 2011, but no action was taken.

Gordon Coutts, the chief executive, was even contacted directly by a patient as early as March 2011. It is believed the trust’s most senior executives missed at least three major opportunities to take action, potentially putting lives at risk. These were:

March 2011: Patient John Campbell contacted Dr Coutts in 2011 after a nurse told him openly in front of other patients that she had heard records were being altered.

But rather than act on the information, the chief executive sent an astonishing reply saying he would only investigate if the patient had evidence of wrongdoing.

IT manager Mr Campbell said he waited more than four months for surgery to have part of his prostate removed, after a blood test indicated he could have cancer.

When he asked a nurse why there had been a delay, he was stunned by her response.

‘The nurse said she was very sorry and said the rumour was waiting lists were being manipulated,’ he said.

‘She said the rumour was they were removing people from the waiting list and putting them back on again with new dates so their wait would not seem too long. I couldn’t believe it.’

Mr Campbell, 52, wrote a letter to Dr Coutts to say he was ‘extremely concerned’ to hear of attempts to ‘manipulate the waiting list system’.

Yet, rather than launch an immediate investigation, the hospital chief sent a curt reply three weeks later, in April 2011.

It said: ‘Your fax implies irregularities in the management of waiting lists. If you would like to provide me with the names or evidence or waiting list irregularities I will investigate this further.

'The trust does not support or tolerate any manipulation of patient records.’

Mr Campbell’s wife Julie said: ‘He asked for us to get evidence, but that is for him to do. He’s at the hospital, he has the records.’

February 2012: The hospital board failed to act when two female clerical workers alerted senior managers that staff members were being pressured to change data.

It prompted a brief investigation by two of Dr Coutts’s most senior executives during which the whistleblowers were not even interviewed and no action was taken.

Dr Coutts, 52, has since admitted the internal investigation was ‘inadequate’, but said ‘it did not seem to be as serious at the time as it was’.

Spring 2013: Dr Coutts was contacted again when a female member of staff sent him an email to report the manipulation of data and bullying.

A source said: ‘It contained a lot of evidence of what was going on and was not a short email. Most chief executives would have made it their duty to immediately investigate it and speak to the person who reported it.

'Instead, they received a one-line email which said a board member would look into it. They never heard back.’

Tim Roberts, of the union Unison, said: ‘We understand that junior staff informed board members about the falsification of data and the bullying of staff to keep quiet about it, in both 2012 and 2013.

'We do not accept the trust’s position that the first they heard about it was in August 2013, when it was reported to the Care Quality Commission.’
