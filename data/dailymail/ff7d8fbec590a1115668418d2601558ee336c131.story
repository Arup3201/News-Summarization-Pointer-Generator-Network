 A man in an inflatable bubble was rescued by the coast guard 70 nautical miles East of St. Augustine on Saturday morning in a bizarre attempt to run to Bermuda from Florida.

Reza Baluchi was found in an inflatable hydro bubble on Wednesday, but waved coast guard officers off, saying he was determined to make the 1,033-mile journey himself.

But three days later he was too exhausted to carry on - so had to be rescued.

Strange traveler: The Coast Guard rescued Reza Baluchi from his Hydro Bubble 70 miles away from St. Augustine, Florida on Saturday

Helicopter rescue: Once all of the aircrew arrived, a rescue swimmer got Baluchi from his inflatable raft and into a helicopter where he was later evaluated by medical crews and found to be uninjured 

Philanthropist: Reza Baluchi is both a daredevil and philanthropist dedicated to achieving great feats and  raising money and awareness for impoverished children in the process 

When rescuers first discovered him on Wednesday, he was disoriented and asking for directions to Bermuda. His bubble contraption was filled with protein bars and bottled water - though he had claimed before leaving he would mostly survive by fishing.

The Coast Guard were worried straight away by Baluchi's state of exhaustion and lack of supplies, so asked him to end his mission.

He refused, so they continued to monitor him until he activated his Personal Locating Beacon on Saturday morning.

When the call came, an HC-130 airplane and a MH-60 helicopter were dispatched to his rescue along with a rescue ship.

Once all of the aircrew arrived, a rescue swimmer got Baluchi from his inflatable raft and into a helicopter where he was later evaluated by medical crews.

He was not injured.

According to Baluchi's website Runwithreza.org, he was on a mission to travel from Florida to Bermuda to prove that the Bermuda Triangle is not dangerous.

On the site he says: 'Everyone wants to know how Reza Baluchi will be successful in his travel to through the Bermuda triangle. Reza is so confident that he will succeed in this trip because he has carefully articulated every detail it takes to survive.'

Avid runner: Reza Baluchi once ran 135 miles nonstop from Death Valley, California to Mt. Whitney,California

Long Journey: Reza Baluchi was attempting to travel 1,033 miles from Florida to Bermuda

Baluchi claims he designed his Hydro Pod specifically to take him on his journey across the ocean - though it was never going to be a walk in the park.

He said: 'Being inside the Hydro Pod is not going to be a walk in the park; it will be very hot and humid. One can easily dehydrate quickly and lose breath.

'Reza has devised this Hydro Pod to prevent physical difficulties. But not anyone can use without being mentally and physically fit. Being mentally fit is the main component to be able to survive a long journey in the Hydro Pod.'

In 2013, Reza tested his Hydro Pod by taking it out from Newport Beach to Catalina Island with apparently great success. 

Reza next wanted cross the Bermuda Triangle because of the stories of shipwrecks and plane crashed linked to the area.

The Bermuda Triangle, also known as the Devil's Triangle, is a region in the western part of the Atlantic in which an imaginary line is drawn from Miami to Bermuda to Puerto Rico.

Vessels have mysteriously disappeared on the journey but mostly in the journey from Florida to Puerto Rico.

On his website, Baluchi describes how the avenger plane Flight 19 took off from the Florida Naval Base in 1945 and never returned after crossing that threshold.

'Reza is aware of the accidents that could happen to him including death. The Bermuda Triangle is one of the deadliest stretches of ocean on Earth. Call him "crazy" but likes to roll the dice,' he says on his site.

Reza Baluchi is still alive and unharmed but whether or not he will attempt his journey once again across the Devil's Triangle is a mystery.

1.The distance between Miami, Fl to Bermuda is approximately 1,033 miles one way.

2. The Hydro Pod is made of 3mm thick of plastic.

3. Inside the Hydro Pod it will reach up 120 degrees Fahrenheit.

4. Reza is an excellent fisherman and he will be catching his food on a daily basis. There be will some days that he will not be able to catch fish. So he will he survive on his own made up protein bars.

5  He will need to manually pump his Hydro Pod for one hour to ensure that it will stay afloat.

6. At night the Hydro Pod will have a light emitting from the bottom to help with the travel.

7. Reza will rest in the early hours of the morning when the sea is calmest

8. On a daily basis 400,000 ships sail through the Bermuda without harm or loss

9.The frame is designed by Mr. Reza Baluchi.

10. A typical day will be, Reza will be sleeping from 6am-9am, will wake up to start running until his body becomes too hot, he will then jump into the sea to cool himself off with a leash strapped to his leg connected to the bubble.

11.He will sleep on a hammock that will be inside the bubble.

12. He will have tracking device on him so that his team is aware of his position at all times.

13. Reza is doing this dangerous journey to raise money for children in need and to give inspire     those that have lost hope for a better future. Also to raise awareness for his Non-Profit Organization called Plant Unity. Plant Unity is a charity devoted to kids that are in need of basic living necessities. For example, clothes, medical and financial help and also to teach them healthy living skills. Plant Unity slogan is 'Children are like roots of a tree – I like to nourish the roots and help them grow.'
