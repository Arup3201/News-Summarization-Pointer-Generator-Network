The Navy has place two admirals on leave while investigating their connection to a massive bribery scheme in Asia involving prostitutes and luxury travel.

Vice Adm. Ted Branch, director of naval intelligence, and Rear Adm. Bruce Loveless, director of intelligence operations, are on temporary leave after their classified access was temporarily suspended Friday.

Both are being investigated over their involvement with Glenn Defense Marine Asia, a Singapore-based defense contractor, the Washington Post reported.

The firm's CEO was arrested in September on charges he bribed naval officers with prostitutes and cash in exchange for privileged information, according to the Post.

Three other senior Navy officials have been arrested in the case.

The investigation is far from over, according to an official who spoke to the Post.

'We do believe that other naval officers will likely be implicated in this scandal,' a Navy spokesman told the paper.

Kirby said the allegations against Branch and Loveless involve conduct before their current assignments and rank. Neither officer has been charged with a crime, but it has not been made clear why they were sanctioned, the Post noted.

Both men will maintain their ranks during the investigation, according to the paper.

While there is no indication any classified information was breached by Mr Branch or Mr Loveless, two other midshipmen have been charged with passing classified data to the defense contractor's CEO, the paper noted.

Among the bribes handed to naval officers are cash, prostitutes, paid travel and tickets to shows all over Asia, the paper reported, citing court documents.

Other midshipmen have been implicated in the scandal, including an officer who handed over classified info to the contractor for payments totaling $100,000, as well as a harem of prostitutes.

Other officers are suspected to be involved, but have not yet been charged. The investigation remains ongoing.
