German prosecutors are investigating the leader of the anti-Muslim PEGIDA movement
 for inciting hatred after a newspaper printed a
photo of him posing as Hitler with the caption 'he's back'.

Lutz Bachmann has been forced to stand down as the group's leader after a furious backlash to the photograph, which he insisted was a joke.

The image showed the 41-year-old sporting a pencil moustache and hair gelled down one side of his face, reminiscent of the Nazi dictator.

Another paper reported that he had described
refugees as 'animals' and 'scumbags'.

PEGIDA's co-founder Lutz Bachmann (pictured) appeared in two newspapers posing as Hitler 

The picture of Bachmann was published in the Hamburger Morgenpost and Bild

The mass-circulation daily Bild printed the photo of
Bachmann with Hitler-style moustache and hair on its front page. 

It quoted him as saying the photo had been taken as a joke,
prompted by a recent satirical book about Hitler called Er ist
wieder da (Look Who's Back).

The Dresdner Morgenpost newspaper also quoted what it said
were Facebook messages from Bachmann saying asylum seekers acted
like 'scumbags' at the welfare office and that extra security
was needed 'to protect employees from the animals'.

The Hitler picture, which was posted to Bachmann's Facebook page, caused an outcry in a country still
trying to come to terms with its Nazi past.

Deputy Chancellor Sigmar Gabriel, a Social Democrat, said
the real face of PEGIDA had been exposed.

'Anyone who puts on a Hitler disguise is either an idiot or
a Nazi. People should think carefully about running after a Pied
Piper like this,' he told Bild.

Bachmann, who has a criminal conviction for burglary but denies he is racist or anti-Muslim, faces a criminal investigation

'Patriotic Europeans Against the Islamisation of the West'
(PEGIDA) has forced itself onto the political agenda with
anti-immigrant slogans that have attracted tens of thousands to
regular rallies in Dresden.

A march by PEGIDA's sister movement LEGIDA is to take place
on Wednesday evening in Leipzig after police banned a PEGIDA
march in Dresden planned for Monday, as well as counter
demonstrations, due to a concrete threat of an attack.

Bachmann, who has a
criminal conviction for burglary but denies he is racist or
anti-Muslim, faces a criminal investigation.

'Preliminary proceedings have been opened. The suspicion is
of incitement to popular hatred,' a spokesman for state
prosecutors in Dresden told Reuters, adding that pictures of the
Hitler pose and other comments attributed to Bachmann had
prompted the probe.

In an interview with Reuters last week, Bachmann played down
a ribald comment made in 2013, seized on by German media, that
'eco-terrorist' Greens, first and foremost former party leader
Claudia Roth, should be 'summarily executed'.

'I am an impulsive person. That was stupid. It was never
meant in that way. But I still think that Frau (Claudia) Roth is
unbearable for the German people,' he said. 'In that moment it
was wrong. I regret I didn't resist my impulsiveness.'
