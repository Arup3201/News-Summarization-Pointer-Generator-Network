Robert Durst's lawyer has dismissed his clients apparent confession during the final seconds of HBO's The Jinx docudrama and said the unguarded comments could be interpreted in a 100 different ways.

The six part series concluded last Sunday with the eccentric millionaire off camera talking to himself in a bathroom with his wireless microphone still live.

'There it is. You're caught. Killed them all. Of course,' Durst was heard to mumble to himself.

HBO's six part docudrama concluded last Sunday with eccentric millionaire Durst off camera talking to himself in a bathroom with his wireless microphone still live

Durst was heard to mumble to himself 'killed them all, of course' in an unguarded moment off camera featured at the end of the final episode of HBO's The Jinx

Durst was arrested by police in New Orleans just hours before the show was broadcast and has since been charged with murder in the December 2000 shooting death of Susan Berman.

There is speculation that Durst's explosive comments could be used against him in court, but attorney Dick DeGuerin said they prove nothing.

'There's one hundred ways of interpreting it ... one of 'em being very Shakespearean. The soliloquy,' he told 48 Hours.

Famously used by Shakespeare in a number of his plays, a soliloquy is an act of speaking one's thoughts aloud when by oneself or regardless of any hearers. For instance Hamlet's 'To be or not to be' speech.

'If you are a student of Shakespeare, as I am, you'll understand that what I'm talking about,' said DeGuerin.

He said he first heard Durst's recorded comments 'along with the rest of America' when it was broadcast last Sunday.

The lawyer also said that it is well know that Durst talks to himself and 'that's just one of his quirks.'

'There are people who feel like he got set up. ...My daughter's a journalist, and she was outraged at what Jarecki and his producers pulled.'

DeGuerin also said he was 'astonished' that Durst was interviewed by Los Angeles prosecutors for three hours without his lawyer present after his arrest last Saturday.

'Bob is not sophisticated, he is intelligent, he's got Asperger's,' said DeGuerin explaining why his client hadn't simply refused to speak until he had his counsil present.

DeGuerin filled court papers on Friday in which he claims Durst was illegally arrested on charges that he murdered a woman in California, as well as drug and weapons charges filed in New Orleans.

In the papers filed at the State Criminal District Court in New Orleans, Gibbens and DeGuerin asked a magistrate judge to schedule a preliminary hearing so that they can prove that there is no probable cause to keep Durst jailed.

They argue that he should be released.

'I think he's an easy target and everybody's piling on. ... They're gonna find nothing,' DeGuerin, the lead attorney on Durst's team, told KTRK-TV.

DeGuerin also accused Andrew Jarecki, the director of The Jinx, right, of setting up Robert Durst

'I think Louisiana and their elected officials want a piece of the publicity pie.'

The judge agreed to schedule that hearing during another court appearance by Durst on Monday in New Orleans.

The attorneys also asked the judge to order that evidence be preserved from the hotel where Durst was arrested.

They are seeking any and all records related to Durst and Everett Ward, the pseudonym Durst used to check into the hotel.

The documents blasted the arrest, which the attorneys say was orchestrated 'to coincide with the final episode of the HBO docudrama The Jinx.

Durst, a member of a wealthy New York real estate family, was charged with murder in California for the December 2000 shooting death of Susan Berman.

Durst's arrest came shortly before the HBO finale about his links to three killings — that of his first wife, who disappeared in New York in 1982; Berman, the daughter a mobster and a close friend who acted as his spokeswoman after his wife disappeared; and a 71-year-old neighbor in Texas whose dismembered body was found floating in Galveston Bay in 2001.

Durst has only ever been tried for the Texas killing, and he was acquitted of murder.

Durst waived extradition in New Orleans but he is being held there on charges that he was a felon in possession of a gun and with illegally carrying a weapon with a controlled substance.

Court documents say investigators found nearly $43,000 in cash, a gun and a rubber mask that could cover his head and neck in his hotel room when he was arrested.

Authorities have also said marijuana was found in the room.

However, Durst's attorneys say his previous convictions are not serious enough to merit the gun charge.

He has been charged in Los Angeles with first-degree murder in the 2000 killing Susan Berman, the daughter of a mobster and a close friend who acted as his spokeswoman after his wife disappeared in New York in 1982.

Durst, 71, who is estranged from a family that has a real estate empire worth an estimated $4 billion, has long denied killing Berman and Kathleen Durst, who was declared dead even though her body was never found.

Investigators had reopened that case and planned to speak with Berman when she was shot once in the back of her head at her home near Beverly Hills.

After the killing, Durst disguised himself as a mute woman and moved into a cheap Galveston, Texas, boarding house where he killed an elderly neighbor in 2001.

He claimed self-defense and was acquitted of murder but was convicted of unlawfully disposing of the man's body, which was found chopped up and floating in Galveston Bay.

While legal experts said Durst's remarks off-camera and to filmmakers during the production will most likely be admissible, prosecutors will have to decide if they outweigh the possibility that the defense would play other portions of interviews showing him denying any killing.

'I would see this moment of unguarded truth as worth a lot of those denials,' said George Fisher, a former prosecutor and professor at Stanford Law School. 'The flat out meaning of the statement is very clear on its face.'

In the case of Blake, prosecutors sought to introduce a portion of a jailhouse interview of the actor discussing his family with Barbara Walters because it contradicted other evidence. The defense then successfully pushed to bring in the rest of the interview.

'It did a great deal both to humanize him and so he wasn't just seen as a celebrity,' said M. Gerald Schwartzbach, who won Blake's acquittal on a murder charge involving the killing of his wife. 'There was an image projected that a lot of people had about Robert as a difficult person. In this video, he came across as a very sympathetic person.'

Prosecutors are not commenting on the Berman case while Durst is still held in Louisiana, where he also faces firearms charges.
