Sydney's 'Bondi hoarders' have held onto their home and the neighbours are less than happy about it.

The Bobolas family managed to stump up the cash to settle a reported $180,000 debt just hours before the house was due to go under the hammer on Tuesday night.

Neighbours had been looking forward to the sale of the property at 19 Boonara Avenue, which was due to be auctioned on Tuesday night by the NSW Sheriff's Office.

The sale had been called to recover money owed for cleaning and legal fees owed to Waverley Council by the Bobolas family.

'This was going to be the second happiest day of my life,' said one neighbour, who did not wish to be named.

'This will never come to an end in my life time. It won't happen until 2045.'

An auction of the infamous Bondi hoarder house was cancelled on Tuesday afternoon after the owners came up with the $180,000

Earlier on Tuesday the NSW Sheriff's Office denied previous reports that the Bobolas family had come up with the cash to stop Tuesday's auction

The Bobolas family, consisting of Mary and her daughters Elena and Liana (pictured in April), were being forced to sell their home

The house was listed for sale by the state government in order to recoup the hundreds of thousands of dollars spent on clearing the mountains of rubbish collected on the property over years

Despite rubbish being piled high, the home was still in a better condition than in previous years.

'What you look at now is actually good, it used to be on the roof,' the neighbour said.

Once the Bobolas family settled the debt, a NSW Department of Justice official said they could continue to live in the home.

Another neighbour came to the defence of the Bobolas family.

'If someone is in a wheelchair, you don't kick them. They have a mental illness, so they need help,' the neighbour said.

'They don't need punishment.

Amazingly, the house is expected to go under the hammer for about $2 million, however the new owner will be required to apply for a court order to evict the family

After amassing an enormous debt to the local council, the notorious Bobolas family  are being forced to sell their garbage-strewn property

If this home wasn't in a wealthy area, no one would care, the neighbour said.

Real estate agent Ric Serrao had expected the 546sqm property to receive bids of up of $1.8 million at auction.

'I'm glad there's been some resolution, but it would have been quite a spectacle from an agent's point of view,' he said.  

The Californian-style home, which has been listed for auction with Raine & Horne Double Bay agent Ric Serrao, has been marketed as 'one of the suburbs most desirable streets' 

The owners of the property - Mary, Elena and Liana Bobolas - have been the centre of controversy over the past few decades as Waverley Council and furious neighbours have battled to get them to clean up their yard
