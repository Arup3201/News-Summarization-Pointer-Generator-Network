Opera star Andrea Bocelli’s was scammed by conmen after they produced tens of thousands of fake bottles of his own branded wine - and sold it for up to ten times the price.

The rip-off versions of Bocelli a Lajatico were sold in Italy and abroad alongside fake bottles of other classic Italian wines, such as Chianti and Brunello.

The huge fraud sheds light on the counterfeit wine trade from which criminal gangs in the agribusiness sector reap millions.

Opera singer Andrea Bocelli has been the victim of a high-level scam after fraudsters bottled
 poor-quality wine and pretended it was the singer's own brand, Bocelli a
 Lajatico

Thousands of bottles of wine, including rip-off version of Chianti, were found by police after raids in Tuscany

The bottles - which were falsely marked as Brunello di Montalcino, Chiantis and the opera singer's own brand - were exposed by police in Tuscany, after a series of raids, Italian newspaper La Repubblica reported.

The wines were said to be of poor quality but carried the highly-prized DOCG label, meaning guaranteed designation of origin.

Investigators trawled wine cellars, shops, supermarkets and bottling factories to undercover the scam.

Police in the regions of Lazio, Liguria and Umbria were also involved, the ministry of agriculture said in a statement.

The blind opera star owns a family winery near Pisa with his brother Alberto, which produces about 300 bottles a year. 

Agriculture Minister Maurizio Martina praised the work of police and described the wine trade as 'one of the main symbols' of Italy’s agricultural heritage.

He said: 'We must continue to work with maximum attention to defend our production from all illegality, which damages the ‘Made in Italy’ [brand].'

Six people are under investigation for fraud and counterfeit.
