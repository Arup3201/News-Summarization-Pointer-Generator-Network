Two shop workers managed to wrestle an axe-wielding armed raider as he attempted to rob a London convenience store. 

Errol Woodger, 28, threatened one staff member behind the counter of the convenience store in Greenwich, south east London on October 13, last. 

Woodger raced behind the counter and punched his victim. He then lashed out several times with his axe in a bid to force the man to open up the till.

The 28-year-old criminal waved the axe at a second man, believed to be a customer, before returning his attention to the man behind the til.

After 22 seconds, a second employee approached the scene was threatened by Woodger, who had a hooded top tightly secured around his head.

A few seconds later, the first employee manages to grab the end of the axe and Woodger panics and tries to flee.

The second worker races to the hatch at the end of the counter and tackles the raider. Both shop workers wrestle with Woodger, forcing him to the ground, narrowly avoiding a display of wine bottles.

During the assault, Woodger kicked the man behind the counter several time and lashed out at the cash register with the axe in an effort to smash it open. 

Police arrived at the St Nicholas convenience store in Greenwich to find Woodger being pinned to the ground by the two shop assistants. 

The men, who are both in their late 30s, were treated at the scene for minor injuries. 

Woodger was later jailed for four years at Woolwich Crown Court  late last month for attempted robbery and possession of an offensive weapon. 

Detective Constable Laura Hills of Greenwich CID said: 'This was a vicious attempt to rob the store and I would like to commend the victims for their extreme bravery in tackling and apprehending a man armed with an axe until police arrived. 

'Greenwich will be a safer place with Woodger behind bars.'
