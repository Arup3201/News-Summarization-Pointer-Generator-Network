For fans of all things astronomical, 2013 could mark the year when their dreams of travelling to space become a reality.

Pioneering companies championing 'space tourism' are planning to send their spaceships into the skies and fine tune their equipment over the next 12 months.

Companies, including Sir Richard Branson's Virgin Galactic, are seeking to send ordinary members of the public into space for the very first time.

Suborbital flights could see passengers taken to beyond the earth's atmosphere, providing views only ever experienced in person by trained astronauts.

Virgin Galactic - billed as the world's 
first commercial 'spaceline' - has carried out successful test flights on its ship SpaceShipTwo, but it is yet to fly any tourists into space.

Hundreds of keen adventures have already paid a refundable deposit to secure their place on the $200,000 flight.

In 2012, Virgin Galactic's SpaceShipTwo underwent significant testing with its first rocket-powered flight expected this year.

Developers of the ship have overseen 22 gliding tests between October 2010 and August 2012.

Virgin Galactic hopes it can now begin 'powered tests' using the hybrid rocket that will propel the vehicle into space after a launch permit was issued by the US Federal Aviation Administration last May.

Prospect: Sir Richard Branson hopes the spaceship will be the first to ferry paying passengers into space on a regular schedule

The rocket has been added to the prototype and fired on the ground 17 times.

Another space tourism pioneer XCOR Aerospace is also building a vehicle known as the Lynx I this year.

The spaceship will be the prototype for the Lynx Mark 2, which it is hoped will eventually fly passengers into suborbital space.

XCOR spokesman Bryan Campen told SPACE: 'We’re looking at 2013 as the time for our test flight program and in early 2013 we’ll get started.

'For the Lynx Mark 1, our prototype craft, we’ll be doing test fights throughout the year from early 2013 and then go into commercial flights.'

Private companies are also hoping to further develop new commercial spacecraft.

Space Exploration Technologies has already flown its unmanned Dragon capsule three times but is planning an astronaut-carrying version of the craft.

The company is among those battling it out to win a transportation contract from NASA to transfer crew to the International Space Station.
