After she parked her pickup truck in front of the main entrance, she ran into the lobby to check out. While she was doing so, someone jumped in her truck and sped off â€” with Scout inside.

'He had to be watching and waiting out there, it happened very fast," she told Oklahoma television station News9. 'We ran out the door, that thing was going 60 miles an hour outta here.'

Sundgren then contacted her family and told them to make a post on Facebook with a picture of Scout asking if anyone had seen the beloved pooch and contact them.

Not long after the post was put online, Cynthia Torres, who lives in the Timbers Apartments in Norman, only 2 milles from the La Quinta Inn, spotted Scout sitting in the complex's courtyard.

'I took her in, put her picture on Facebook, 25 minutes later, I'm getting messages,' Torres told News9.

Those message eventually worked their way back to Sundgren, who was reunited with Scout the same day.

'I'm thrilled, I mean, I can't tell you how happy [I am]," Sundgren said. 'I really was afraid I would never see her again. It's a miracle.'

The pickup truck has still not been found.

The Sundgren family hasn't forgotten that without Torres' help, Scout might still be missing. They say they will be sending her a reward.
