Immigration Minister Scott Morrison has told an inquiry into the treatment of children in detention about the 'moral burden' and 'emotional challenges' of his job, but says indulging in sentiment will result in more asylum seeker deaths at sea.

Mr Morrison made the comments during his opening statement into an Australian Human Rights Commission inquiry hearing into the treatment of children in detention.

'There is much emotion in this serious topic that is before your inquiry. There should be,' he told AHRC president Gillian Triggs in Canberra.

'As a parent of two young children, the emotional challenges of working in this policy portfolio are just as real and just as great [as] they would be any other parent in my position.

'But sentiment cannot be indulged at the expense of effective policy that is saving lives and ending the chaos and tragedy that was occurring.'

He said the Australian people decided at the last election that enough children had drowned while seeking asylum.

'There is no decision that I, or any of my predecessors, take as a minister in this area that is free of moral burden.'

150 children will be released from mainland detention centres into the community. But approximately 700 children will remain in detention on Christmas Island (pictured) and on Nauru

The inquiry comes as this week Mr Morrison announced that 150 children held in mainland detention centres would be released into the community on bridging visas by the end of the year.

Approximately 700 children will remain in detention centres, including those in Nauru and on Christmas Island.

Concerns have been raised by refugee advocacy groups about the effect mandatory detention has on children, with allegations of physical and sexual abuse and deprivation outlined in a recent report released by the Australian Human Rights Commission.

However Mr Morrison said the inquiry should be investigating his Labor predecessors, under whose watch most of the children arrived in Australia.

Mr Morrison expressed disappointment the commission had not sought testimony from his four Labor predecessors, given more than 8,469 children arrived in Australia by boat during the Labor years.

'I invite the commission to rectify this situation by extending an invitation to my predecessors,' he said.

Under the Abbott government, more children had been released from detention than put in, he said.

He said just 353 children had arrived in Australia by boat since the September election, while 537 were released from detention - with the further 150 to come out in coming months.

Prof Triggs pressed Mr Morrison for any evidence that detaining children for long periods of time had a deterrence effect.

'There appears to be no connection between these two,' she said.

People she had interviewed in mainland centres and on Christmas Island had 'no idea' of that aspect of government's policy.

But Mr Morrison said detention of young children was merely a consequence of the government's policy not to allow refugees to be processed in Australia.

That was followed by a heated exchange about whether detention facilities employed armed guards and resembled prisons.

Prof Triggs said there was no way into the centres except through armed guards.

Immigration department secretary Martin Bowles took issue, categorically denying armed guards work at the centres and calling on Prof Triggs to retract her statement.

The commissioner then claimed conditions on Christmas Island were similar to those of prisons, prompting Mr Morrison to query whether she was comparing the facility with Long Bay jail.

Prof Triggs said she would like to move on.

Mr Morrison blamed the government's lack of movement on processing tens of thousands of backlogged refugee applications on the Senate, which was refusing to pass the reintroduction of temporary visas.

The government's policy was to no longer grant permanent visas to refugees meaning there was no visa available for them, he said.

'And the government is not going to allow a set of policies to be weakened that would see an Australian staring into the face of a child corpse again,' he said.
