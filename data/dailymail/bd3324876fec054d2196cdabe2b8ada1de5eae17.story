The brother of notorious prisoner Charles Bronson, pictured, claims that the criminals was approached to appear on I'm A Celebrity... Get Me Out of Here

The brother of one of the Britain's most violent prisoners has claimed the criminal has been approached to be a contestant on I'm A Celebrity... Get Me Out Of Here.

Mark Peterson, brother of notorious prisoner, Charles Bronson has said plans were discussed for his sibling to appear on the ITV reality show should he get parole.

Bronson, who is serving a life sentence for robbery and kidnap at Full Sutton Prison in York, has been behind bars for 40 years mainly in solitary confinement due to his 'aggression'

But using his brother's real name Michael, Mr Peterson says the prisoner had been asked to appear on the programme and believes he would have come across as a bright and charismatic man.

He said: 'A few years ago he was approached to appear on I'm A Celebrity...Get Me Out Of Here! should he ever get parole.

'And I can just imagine him on that.

'He'd be brilliant on that show because no matter what they'd find to throw at him he'd have already had it 100 times worse.

'The only downside would be that none of the other contestants would get a look-in.

'Come every bushtucker trial, Mickey would always be the first one with his hand in the air.'

Originally given seven years for an armed raid on a Cheshire post office in 1974 - in which he netted just £26.18 - it was Bronson's violent behaviour towards guards and fellow prisoners while incarcerated, which led to his tariff being significantly extended.

Over the years, he has been involved in at least ten jail sieges and the outbursts have seen him moved 150 times.

He was given a life sentence in 1999 for holding a prison art teacher hostage for 44 hours for criticising some of his sketches.

Earlier this year, it was reported that Charles Bronson ‘smeared himself in butter before taking on 12 prison guards’ after Arsenal won the FA Cup.

The Tottenham Hotspur fan admitted he had 'another rumble' with prison guards after the North London side beat Hull beat Hull at Wembley.

But Mr Peterson, 53, is hopeful that his 61-year-old brother will be successful in appealing against his sentence for a third time and that he should then spend his days with his brother near the Ceredigion coast in Wales.

He added: 'I feel like this would be the best place for him, somewhere stable where he can rehabilitate slowly back into society.

'The world's very different now compared to the '70s and all the things we take for granted are totally alien to Michael.

'He's never even had a mobile phone.' 

A spokeswoman for ITV told the Daily Mirror that Bronson had not been approached to appear on the show and that they would not have put that request to him.
