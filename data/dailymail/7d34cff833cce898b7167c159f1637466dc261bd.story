Accomplished soldier: L/Cpl Jonathan McKinlay died when his patrol came under fire in Afghanistan's Helmand Province on September 14

Tributes have been paid to a British soldier killed in Afghanistan who 'died trying to make the world a better place'.

Lance Corporal Jonathan McKinlay, of B Company, 1st Battalion The Rifles, was killed on September 14 by a burst of small-arms fire while on patrol with his team.

Family and friends gathered for his funeral at St George Church, Bulford Camp, Wiltshire, today - on the 10th anniversary of the conflict in Afghanistan.

His union flag-draped coffin adorned with flowers was carried into the small church by six of L/Cpl McKinlay's comrades to the sound of High on a Hill.

The 33-year-old from Darlington, County Durham, leaves behind his wife Lisa, mother Valerie, sister Becca, daughter Megan and stepchildren Ollie and Piper.

During the service, tears mingled with mirth as people laughed at stories from L/Cpl McKinlay's life.

The mourners were told 'there was never a dull moment' when L/Cpl McKinlay was around.

Speaking to more than 200 mourners packed into the church, Padre Grant Ashton told them L/Cpl McKinlay had 'died trying to make the world a better place'.

He read out a few words from L/Cpl McKinlay's mother, who said: 'Jonathan always lived life by the skin of his teeth.

'He sky-dived, loved it; he rode a motorbike, loved it; and he was an infantry soldier, loved it. Not a safe trio, I'm sure you'll agree.

'He died doing the job he loved with his kind of people around him.

'As his mum, I will miss him dearly until the end of my days. Life is going to be a lot duller without him.'

Poignant: L/Cpl McKinlay's funeral was held on the 10th anniversary of the start of Operation Enduring Freedom, the invasion of Afghanistan

Serjeant Gavin Shorrock, who had been L/Cpl McKinlay's best man at his wedding, read a tribute from Lisa.

It said: 'From the moment we met, you wowed me. We connected right there and then and always said we were two missing pieces come together.

'Wherever you are Jon, forever you have our hearts. Watch over Ollie, Megan and Piper and me. I love you.'

Sjt Shorrock added his own stories of L/Cpl McKinlay, bringing laughter from the congregation about nights out, fancy dress and on-tour anecdotes of three course meals using almost all of their ration packs.

He added: 'Jon, I cannot believe I'm standing here doing this when it is only 11 months ago I was doing your best man speech. I was proud of you then and I am proud of you now.

'You served your country with honour and you were an asset to the Rifles. Mate, it's never going to be the same without you. You've done your job, stand down.'

Paying respects: Soldiers from the 1 Rifles Honour Guard fire volleys within the grounds of the church as L/Cpl McKinlay's coffin is placed into the back of the hearse

Following the Last Post, the coffin was taken from the church to the sound of Pink's Who Knew.

As it was placed into the back of the hearse, the 1 Rifles Honour Guard fired volleys within the grounds of the church.

Watching the hearse, with flowers that spelled out Dad, his family wiped tears from their cheeks and hugged each other before the cortege made its way to Salisbury for a private cremation.

L/Cpl McKinlay was known as an outgoing and friendly commander who was said to have had time for everyone he met.

Paying tribute, Major Alex Price, 1 Rifles, said: 'To anyone who met him, L/Cpl McKinlay made an instant impact.

'He was a man of great character, he was agile of mind and he was not afraid to express a considered opinion when the opportunity arose.

'He took delight in doing things for others to make their life more comfortable and he was a real grafter. He was happy to help out in any scenario no matter how big or small the contribution required.

'1 Rifles have lost a fantastic battalion character and a highly accomplished soldier.'

Too many deaths: L/Cpl McKinlay is among 382 British troops who have died since operations in Afghanistan began in 2001 in the wake of the 9/11 terror attacks

L/Cpl McKinlay deployed to Afghanistan as a battle-casualty replacement in June 2011, having recently qualified as a Bravo Mortar Fire Controller.

He was based in Checkpoint Chaabak in the Nahr-e Saraj (South) district of Helmand.

The soldier was with members of the Afghan Uniform Police in a village near his checkpoint when they came under attack.

This week marks 10 years since the US and UK launched the campaign known as Operation Enduring Freedom in the aftermath of the 9/11 terror attacks.

The conflict in Afghanistan has left hundreds of British families mourning the deaths of loved ones who fought and died there.

The number of British troops who have died since operations in Afghanistan began in 2001 currently stands at 382. This compares with 179 UK personnel who died in Iraq between 2003 and 2009.

L/Cpl McKinlay joined the Army in 1996 and racked up 'a great degree of experience' throughout his career, with deployments to Northern Ireland, Iraq and Afghanistan, the Ministry of Defence said.

The MoD added: 'He held an impressive array of qualifications on top of this, making him a great asset to his company and the battalion.'
