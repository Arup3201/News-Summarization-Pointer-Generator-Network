Daniel Sturridge's dance moves were back at Anfield last Saturday when he scored in the second half of Liverpool's 2-0 win against West Ham and the striker's return to fitness has clearly been welcomed by the rest of the squad.

For Raheem Sterling, Jordon Ibe and Mario Balotelli, it appears they have particularly enjoyed Sturridge's return to the first-team fold.

Sturridge uploaded a video on Instagram of Sterling and Ibe dancing in the changing rooms to 'Blessings' by Big Sean featuring Drake and Kanye West, before the camera cuts to the striker himself doing a jig reminiscent of his renowned scoring celebration.

But as the England man jives away, Mario Balotelli wanders behind Sturridge and jokingly scowls at the camera, with Sturridge seemingly unaware the Italian is even there.

But Balotelli's gesture was clearly taken well by Sturridge, who captioned the video 'Too much jokes...'

Brendan Rodgers' side were straight back into training on Thursday, the day after their 2-1 victory over Bolton in the FA Cup, to prepare for Saturday's Merseyside derby.

Sturridge's injury comeback continued against Neil Lennon's side as he was brought on in the 70th minute for Joe Allen and he could make his first start since August against Everton. 

But Rodgers refused to be drawn on whether Sturridge would play form the beginning.

'I think every player wants to play, not just Daniel,' he said.

'He is coming along very well. It is not that he won't start, we just need to analyse that over the next couple of days.

'We focus on the details on the game; whether it is at Anfield or Goodison, they are tough games but we are playing well, arrive into it creating opportunities that we weren't at the start of the season and we are really excited.'

Rodgers must decide whether to partner Sterling with Sturridge in attack against Everton

It was Sterling, the man Sturridge referred to as a 'little brother' following the West Ham victory, who scored Liverpool's equaliser in the fourth-round replay at Bolton, before Philippe Coutinho struck a last minute winner.

Rodgers will also have to decide whether to bring Balotelli back into the squad on Saturday, as the Italy international did not even make the bench in midweek.

Ibe, a pacy winger with similar skills to Sterling, is held in high regard at Anfield and was recalled from his loan at Derby as Rodgers felt he could contribute to Liverpool's top-four challenge. 

But it is Coutinho who Everton will hope to keep quiet in Saturday's late kick-off at Goodison Park.

The Brazil international has been in sensational form of late and signed a long-term deal at the club on Tuesday.

Sterling was full of praise for him after the Bolton win, saying: 'Philippe has that magic to turn the game on its head and that's what he did.

'It was great individual skill and a great finish.'
