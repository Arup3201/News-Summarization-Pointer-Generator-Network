A California mother who gave up her first-born son nearly 50 years ago, met him for the first time this weekend in an emotional reunion. Raella Bodinus, 67, sobbed as she hugged her son Ken Drake at his home in Lindon, Utah.

'We've been waiting a long time for this,' she said. 'You look like one of my kids.'

Bodinus was just 16-years-old when she gave birth to Drake in May 1964, at a home for teen mothers in Los Angeles.

The out-of-wedlock pregnancy was covered up, as her family told everyone that she  attending a prep school in Washington State. Not even her boyfriend, Drake's biological father, knew where she was.

The teen mother was never allowed to touch her infant son after he was born, as nurses quickly shuttled off the newborn to the nursery.

In the end, Bodinus decided to give her son to another family in a closed adoption.

'It had been decided. I was hoping and praying he was with a good family, and I didnâ€™t want to impose,' Bodinus told the Salt Lake Tribune.

The teen mom went on to marry birth-father Richard Bodinus in August 1965, a little over a year after giving birth to Ken, and the two went on to have two more children of their own - a daughter named Robin and a son named Ricky.

Meanwhile, Drake grew up happy in Riverside, California with his parents and another adopted sister.

He reconnected with his birth mother last month after submitting a DNA profile to genealogy site Ancestry.com and was received a 'close match' to Richard Larsen - his birth mother's brother and his biological uncle.

Drake, now 49, says he wasn't out to find his birth mother, since his adopted sister became estranged after reuniting with her own birth mother.

'The fallout from that was really bad,' Drake said. 'I never wanted to put my mom through that.'

But he was interested in genealogy and submitted the profile to learn more about his ethnic background.

He sent a message to Larsen after the match, and his uncle responded back just two days later saying he was '99 per cent sure' who his mother was.

'She would like you to contact her if you are OK with that,' Larsen wrote, adding a cell phone number.

It was obvious once they started exchanging photos that the two were related, and they quickly planned a trip to Drake's home in Lindon, Utah to reconnect.

Bodinus' daughter, and Drake's full biological sister, Robin Ramirez came along for the reunion as well which took place on Friday.

During their weekend reunion, Ramirez discovered she shared her aversion to egg whites with her brother, while noting that brothers Ricky and Drake share musical talents.

For Drake, meeting his mother for the first time made him finally understand the reasons why she had to give him up.

'I was naive,' Drake said, 'and I never really understood the social forces that shaped what my birth mom had to go through. I never really gave it any thought, and I feel guilty now because I never put myself in her place and imagined what she was feeling.'
