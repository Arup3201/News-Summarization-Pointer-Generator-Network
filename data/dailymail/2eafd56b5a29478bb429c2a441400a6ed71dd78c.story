Ukip has surged to a record level of support in the wake of Brussels’ demands for an extra £1.7billion from Britain.

Some 19 per cent of people now say they will back Nigel Farage’s party, twice the level seen early last year. Mr Farage last night said the EU should be told to ‘get stuffed’ and said the demand had been a 'gift' to his party.

The rise of Ukip has come at the expense of both the main parties, with Labour slumped at the lowest level of support since Ed Miliband became leader.

Ukip has jumped four points to 19 per cent - one point above their previous highest rating in a ComRes telephone poll in June

The new ComRes survey for The Independent puts Labour neck and neck with the Tories on 30 per cent.

It means Mr Miliband has dropped five points in just a month, his worst rating ever as leader.

At the same time backing for Ukip has jumped four points to 19 per cent - one point above their previous highest rating in a ComRes telephone poll in June.

The Liberal Democrats are down one point on 9 per cent and the Greens unchanged on 4 per cent.

Ukip appears to have been bolstered by the huge row over the demand that Britain pays an extra £1.7billion to the EU by December 1.

Ed Miliband has seen support for Labour slump to its lowest level since he became leader, and is now neck and neck with David Cameron's Tories on 30 per cent

David Cameron yesterday insisted he will not meet the deadline, but suggested Britain could end up handing over hundreds of millions of pounds.

He told MPs that the row had undermined public support for the EU. Despite his combative stance in the Commons, the Prime Minister appeared to shift his position by saying it was the ‘scale’ of the cash demand that was unjustified.

However Mr Farage said he would tell the European Union to “get stuffed quite frankly”. He told ITV’s The Agenda: ‘Quite honestly politically it's a gift to Ukip… The Prime Minister was very clear.

‘We will not be paying this money before the first of December. 

‘What he really means is they won't pay it until after the Rochester by-election. Then we will pay it because those are the rules of the club. ‘Either we abide by those rules or we say the club's not for us… I wouldn't pay it today. Never.’

Budget commissioner Jacek Dominik said it would be 'extremely difficult' for the Prime Minister to challenge the EU's demand for extra cash.

Mr Dominik said the move risked opening a 'Pandora's box' which could put the future of the UK's £3billion-a-year rebate in question. 

But in a statement to the House of Commons this afternoon Mr Cameron said: ‘Britain will not be paying two billion euros to anyone on December 1 and we reject this scale of payment.'

And in a clear indication that he believes the row has undermined public support for EU membership, Mr Cameron told MPs: ‘For those of us who want to argue that the European Union is capable of reform, this was not a good development.’
