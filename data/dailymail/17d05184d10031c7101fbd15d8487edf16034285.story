His fans include Katy Perry, Miley Cyrus and Katy Perry and his SS14 collection was inspired by 
the idea of a 'glamorous walk of shame', so it's no surprise Ashish's new collection for Topshop is pretty out-there.

The Delhi-born king of sequins, scrunchies, slogans and all things metallic has just unveiled his tenth range and while it doesn't land in stores until May 29, his army of celebrity fans are already wearing his designs.

Inspired by what he describes as his 
'Paradise Hotel', the range is full of tongue-in-cheek slogans such as 
'My name is....My room number is...' and 'I want to...your...' 
emblazoned on towels and oversized T-shirts.

New in: Delhi-born, London-based designer Ashish has unveiled his tenth collection for Topshop and with fans including Miley Cyrus and Rita Ora, it's as quirky as you'd expect

'Ashish brings his humour and style together to create a fashion collection for beach to bedroom, pool to club,' said Kate Phelan, Topshop creative director.

'Light-up trainers, towelling hoodies and towel wrap-dresses make hotel style the ultimate look for summer.'

There are
 also plenty of mesh tops that wouldn't look out of place in Miley 
Cyrus' wardrobe, and light-up backpacks - all modelled by Cara 
Delevingne's model BFF, Mary Charteris.

Witty: Ashish is known for conveying his humour through his slogans and his new range for Topshop doesn't disappoint (£40)

Embrace your inner kid: The new range is full of LED light-up buffalo boots and back-packs, as modelled by Cara Delevingne's best friend Mary Charteris (light-up backpack and buffalo boots, £350)

One for Miley? Miss Cyrus, known for her penchant of all things mesh, would love this £65 fishnet dress

Fancy embracing your inner six-year-old? You'll love the stand-out LED Buffalo Boots.

The light-up wedge trainers have already been spotted on Lily Allen, Lady Gaga, Ellie Goulding and Rita Ora - however, at £350, they don't come cheap.

More affordable pieces include his £30 'Not Now' eye mask and £35 'Por favor, no fotos, gracias' vest.

Speaking to Vogue.com about the range, the designer said: 'In a way I think the LED lights are almost like light-up sequins. Sequins are like a long-term love, this collection is like my holiday fling!'

Naughty! Ashish is well known for his love of bold statements and these tongue-in-cheek T-shirts stick to his signature style (£40)

Room service: Ashish has created clothing for his fictional 'Paradise Hotel' including towel dresses with hilarious slogans

First look: The wacky shoes were unveiled at his AW14 runway show and they're coming to a store near you next week

Of course she's got some! Savvy dresser Lily Allen has already got her hands on the coveted trainers
