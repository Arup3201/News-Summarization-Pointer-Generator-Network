Another entry in Jermain Defoe’s little book, another dilemma for Gus Poyet.

How do you rest a man who, on current form, will comfortably keep Sunderland in the Premier League?

That was the question niggling at Poyet this weekend, barely a week after admitting he did not enjoy watching his side play. That he spent much of Saturday wearing a huge grin says everything about the impact of a striker who has scored twice in three league games.

Swansea have not lost against a side from the bottom half of the table this season.

The latest of those, a delightful strike against Swansea, means he is the only striker to have scored against all 20 clubs in the Premier League. 

Trivial, maybe, but goals are what Sunderland have lacked and they keep Defoe interested.

‘Things like that are always special to me,’ Defoe said. ‘I keep a note of things I’ve done, a little incentive.

‘I just write down lists — sometimes it’s things I’ve done, sometimes it’s things I want to do. It hasn’t been much of a surprise. When you’ve spent your whole career in the Premier League it should not take you too long to get back into the swing of things.’

To that end, Poyet is hoping for 10 goals from the 32-year-old. 

Poyet said: ‘It was a perfect deal, signing Jermain. Sometimes things happen for a reason and I hope it was that we deserved to get a player like Jermain. If he gets 10 goals we’re going to finish in a very nice place.’

The dilemma comes from knowing Defoe, whose opener on Saturday was cancelled out by Ki Sung-Yueng, must be handed a break at some point. 

Poyet said: ‘When someone scores goals you cannot drop him. He’s going to have to die on the pitch.’
