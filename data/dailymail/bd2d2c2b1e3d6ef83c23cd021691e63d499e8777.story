The relatives of an eight-year-old girl who died as she was allegedly sexually abused by her father have heard horrific details in court of how her murdered body was found.

Hiawayi Robinson's body was found partially unclothed at a dumping ground in Prichard, Alabama on September 18 - two days after she was reported missing after heading out to meet her father.

Her crumpled body was surrounded by trash, her Hello Kitty t-shirt was pulled up and her purple shorts and underwear were pulled off one leg and hanging around the other knee, Agent Deric Taylor of the State Bureau of Investigations testified in court, Al.com reported.

The details emerged on Monday during a preliminary hearing in the case against her father, Hiawatha Robinson, 38. After the testimony, the judge ruled that a grand jury should hear the case.

Arrest: Hiawatha Robinson, left, has been charged with murder and sodomy for the death of his eight-year-old daughter Hiawayi, right, who was found killed in Prichard, Alabama in September

Robinson, seen in court on Monday, kept his back to the courtroom, where sobbing family members sat, during his hearing

During the hearing, Hiawayi's relatives cried softly - and one relative became so emotional that she fled from the courtroom, the website reported.

Robinson, who joined the search for his daughter when she vanished and made a public appeal for her safe return, has been charged with felony murder and first-degree sodomy.

The Mobile County District Attorney's Office believes Hiawayi died during a sexual assault but have not provided further information about how exactly she died. 

Robinson's attorney, Jeff Deen, said that there is no DNA evidence connecting him to the case.

A swab was taken of the little girl's body and, while semen was found, the swab was contaminated and a DNA test could not be carried out, Deen said. 

'They don't have any DNA connecting him to the case,' he told Al.com. 'They have some circumstantial evidence. The people that I've talked to that seem to just come up to me, that seem to know Hiawatha, they can't believe that he would be involved in something like this.'

Tragic: A court heard how her little body was found partially clothed at a dumping ground off this road in Prichard two days after she vanished. After the testimony, the judge ruled a grand jury should hear the case

But prosecutors believe the young girl's father was to blame. 

'The facts will show that while engaging in sodomy in the first degree, Hiawatha Robinson Jr. caused the death of Hiawayi Robinson,' Mobile County District Attorney Ashley Rich said while announcing the charges last month.

Rich is waiting for more results from the FBI crime lab in Quantico and said there are 'dozens and dozens' of pieces of evidence.  

In Alabama, the charge means someone is accused of engaging in 'deviant sexual intercourse' with someone under the age of 12, AL.com reported.

Loss: Hiawayi told her grandma she was going to meet her dad on September 16 but never returned

'Deviant sexual intercourse is defined in the law of the state of Alabama as sexual gratification involving the sexual organs of one person and the mouth or the anus of another person,' Rich said.

Rich would not say whether the alleged abuse by the father had been ongoing.

On the day she vanished, Hiawayi returned home from school to change her clothes because she was wet from the rain. Her father then called her and they spoke for 17 minutes, Taylor said.

Hiawayi then told her grandmother she was heading to her cousin's apartment in the same complex because her father was going to meet her there to give her $150 for her birthday.

But the cousin later told police she would not have been at the apartment at that time.

Hiawayi headed out and never returned home. She was reported missing by her grandmother around 10pm that evening. 

Her body was found two days later around a mile from their home.

After she went missing, authorities looked at surveillance footage taken from businesses along a strip mall near their home and saw a red SUV driving along the road. 

That day, her father had been driving his girlfriend's red Chevrolet Tahoe, authorities said. 

In separate surveillance footage from a store that afternoon, Hiawayi could be seen buying candy and then heading in the direction where the SUV was seen.

Fifteen minutes after she left the store, her father called her grandmother to see where the little girl was, authorities said. 

Plea: After she vanished, her father, pictured, appeared on local TV stations pleading for her safe return

During a later search of his girlfriend's car, police found a clear hair bead, like those worn by Hiawayi, and black duct tape, Al.com reported.

After she was reported missing, the authorities and the community searched for her, and her parents, who are separated, appeared on television to appeal for information.

'I'm going through pain,' Robinson told Fox10 as he stood beside her mother, Yosha Populus. 

'I've been up for the last 24 hours, I've been up all night searching for her - ain't had anything to eat, anything to drink, I ain't going to stop until it's over with - until she's in her home. That's all I want, that's all I ask for.'

When asked what he thought might have happened to her, he said: 'Nothing.'

'I don't believe nothing happened to her,' he said. 'I believe she's out there. She's out there. They just need to let her come home. Her daddy gonna find out what the f*** going on.'

Her mother also pleaded for information as she stood beside the girl's father.

After the arrest was announced, Populus's godfather, Kourney Adams, told Al.com: 'She's been praying it wouldn't be him.'

But he added that they were thankful that finally someone has been arrested.

'We thought they had given up,' he said. 'Thank you to the FBI and the Mobile and the city of Prichard for doing their job.' 

If Robinson is found guilty of all current charges against him  jurors would be unable to hand him the death penalty as he has not been charged with capital murder.
