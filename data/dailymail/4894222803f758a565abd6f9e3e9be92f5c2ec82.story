Karin  Ward, 56, is facing a High Court trial for accusing Freddie Starr of 'groping her', according to court documents

A Savile abuse victim has slammed the BBC and ITV for 'leaving her on her own' as she faces a £300,000 defamation claim brought by Freddie Starr. 

Karin Ward, 56, is facing a High Court libel trial over accusations that comedian Starr 'groped her and called her a '***less wonder' when she was just 15', according to court documents.

The mother-of-seven, who is recovering from cancer, claims she felt pressured into giving a taped interview with Newsnight in 2011 when she was 'vulnerable' and believed she was dying from the disease.

'The BBC turned up uninvited in my life when I was very vulnerable, suffering from cancer and asked for my help to make their programme,' the mother from Oswestry, Shropshire told MailOnline.

'This involved raking up extremely painful memories of sexual abuse by Jimmy Saville when I was a schoolgirl.

'I felt pressurised to do so, thought I was dying from cancer and so eventually agreed to take part. I would never have done so if I had known that I could be sued, that they would not support me and I was on my own in all this.'

But the Newsnight report was shelved and her claims were aired on Panorama 11 months later, despite producers not asked her permission.

Ms Ward also claimed that Newsnight told her they would not identify Freddie Starr in the Newsnight programme, but 'Panorama ignored this'.

Starr, 72, is now suing Ms Ward for damages over her allegations that he ‘groped the defendant’s breasts and backside and called her a ***less wonder while in Jimmy Savile’s dressing room after a show called Clunk Click in 1974’, according to the defamation claim form. 

The action centres on words spoken by Ms Ward and broadcast by BBC, ITV and ITN News in 2011.

Starr - who has not been charged over allegations of historic sexual abuse - is seeking £300,000 to cover lost theatre bookings as well as an injunction to stop Ms Ward repeating the allegations. 

Both the BBC and ITV have refused to cover Ms Ward's legal costs – despite the fact that she was an interviewee for their programmes.

According to the court papers, in November 2011 Ms Ward told BBC journalist Liz MacKean: 'That's when the other guests on the show would come in, generally after the show had finished, they would come in and they clearly saw girls and, well, kids, male and female, as there to be used.

'I had a famous person who would try, he smelled awful, he smelled of sweat and alcohol and it made me heave just to be near him, so I certainly didn't want him to do anything to me.'

Ms Ward said: 'If you are a contributor on a TV documentary made by the BBC or ITV/ITN you should be in no doubt that if you get sued, you will be on your own and they will not help you.

'You have no control over what they choose to include and you then find yourself in the position of having to defend their journalism on your own.'

The mother, whose testimony helped expose Jimmy Savile, added: 'It's absolutely disgraceful. Nobody in their right mind should take part in a TV documentary, even one where you think you are doing the right thing like exposing Jimmy Savile.'

Her lawyer Mr Price said: 'Ms Ward has been sued for the Panorama programme, but she did not give permission for the interview to be broadcast.

'The footage was initially taken for the Newsnight programme, but she did not say it could be used for another programme a year later.' 

The mother also spoke on camera in the ITV documentary that brought Savile's abuse to public attention - Exposure: The Other Side of Sir Jimmy Savile.

The defamation claim also cites in the on-camera interview with ITN that Ms Ward said: 'I was horribly, horribly humiliated by Freddie Starr who had a bad attack of wandering hands and had groped me and I didn't like him because he smelled like my step-father and it frightened me and freaked me out and I rebuffed him and he humiliated me in front of everyone in the dressing room.'

Starr, 70, initially denied appearing on the show or meeting her. But when footage emerged showing her standing behind him on Clunk Click, he was forced to admit he was 'mistaken' but still denied the 'awful allegation' of abuse.

ITV/ ITN are also not planning to cover Ms Ward's court costs.

Ms Ward has even claimed that ITV/ ITN was not even willing to provide the information and documents she asked for to help defend the libel case.

Starr – who has not been charged over allegations of historic sexual abuse following a thorough police investigation – is proceeding with a legal claim accusing Ms Ward of defaming him.

A 10-day libel trial is expected to take place in June or July.

The case against the comedian was dropped in May last year after prosecutors said there was insufficient evidence to support the claims of 13 women that he molested them up to 40 years ago.

A BBC spokesperson: 'We wouldn't comment on individual legal cases but we note that following ITN's programme these allegations were repeated across the media, including extensively in the Daily Mail.'
