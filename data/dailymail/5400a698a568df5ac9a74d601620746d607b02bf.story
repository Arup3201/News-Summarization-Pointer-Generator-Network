Innocent: Miss Cooper admitted to being 'cheeky' but denied any wrongdoing - she was cleared of all charges

A lesbian police community support officer who was accused of groping five colleagues sobbed in court after she was cleared of all charges.

Sylvia Cooper, 45, said she wanted to get back to an ordinary life following her 'two year nightmare' and accused her fellow cops of making the allegations because they were jealous of her success.

She was accused of groping three female officers' breasts and bottoms, as well as grabbing the genitals of two male cops.

Miss Cooper was also accused of propositioning a female colleague by asking her if she 'fancied a shag'.

Miss Cooper, who was a PCSO with West Midlands Police for five years before she was forced to resign, told the jury at Warwick Crown Court she had been 'shocked and horrified' when she learned of the allegations made against her by two female PCSOs, two male police constables and a male PCSO.

Two days before the allegations were put to her, Cooper had been presented with a Women in Policing award in front of about 200 people.

The jury found Miss Cooper, of Stourbridge, West Mids, not guilty of eight counts of sexual assault after deliberating for seven hours and 41 minutes.

Innocent Cooper had worked in the prison service for more than ten years and then for a security firm until joining the police as a PCSO in the West Midlands in August 2005.

During her four-day trial Miss Cooper was described as 'a credit to the service'.

But Miss Cooper told the court there had been 'a hell of a lot of jealousy' after she got the award, which she had been recommended by her sergeant.

She told defence barrister Martin Steen: 'I broke down in tears. I couldn’t believe it, I was so shocked and horrified.'

Miss Cooper admitted being 'cheeky' and giving one of her female colleagues 'a childhood flick on the bottom' as they walked up a flight of stairs at a police station.

She also admitted joking with a male colleague that he had a 'nice package' when he walked into police station wearing a pair of cycling shorts.

Miss Cooper mouthed 'thank you' to the jury and sobbed with relief as the verdict was read out on Monday.

'Hell of a lot of jealously' - Miss Cooper believes the the true reason behind the allegations was envy

Outside court Miss Cooper accused her colleagues of falsely accusing her because they were jealous of her because she won a prestigious policing award.

She said: 'I’m grateful to the jury for their careful deliberations.

'I was falsely accused by some who were resentful that I had been put forward for the Women in Policing community award.

'The last two years have been a nightmare. I hope I may now be allowed to continue my life in the ordinary way.'

Her partner Rebecca Morris added: 'At last. It’s been two years. It should never have got here.'
