Uruguay striker Luis Suarez scored two goals during a friendly match against Oman on Monday.

The Barcelona ace, who could make his La Liga debut against Real Madrid on October 25, netted a brace in the second half to help his side claim a win.

His first came in the 57th minute when he was allowed the space and time to score past Oman goalkeeper Ali Al Habsi from inside the penalty area.

The Wigan Athletic goalkeeper was forced into picking the ball out of his net just 10 minutes later when Suarez chipped Al Habsi.

Suarez's deft lob over the onrushing custodian was further proof as to why Barcelona decided to fork out £75million on the former Liverpool ace.

Jonathan Rodriguez added a late third in the closing stages of the friendly encounter.

Suarez tweeted after the match that he was glad to get some 'important minutes' under his belt.
