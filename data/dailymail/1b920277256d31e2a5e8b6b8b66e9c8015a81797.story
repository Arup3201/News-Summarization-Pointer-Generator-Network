Two men who used a roundabout and dual carriageway as a 'stunt track' have been prosecuted after being on camera.

Danny Neville, 54, and William Smith, 22, raced each other in a silver Toyota Supra and a purple Nissan 200 in Horsham, West Sussex, Crawley Magistrates' Court heard.

They also carried out ‘drifting’ manoeuvres, skidding their cars across the dual carriageway around Great Daux roundabout on the A24.

They were both charged with driving without due care and attention after residents complained about the noise and informed police, who went out equipped with handheld cameras.

Neville, of Bridge Street, Leatherhead, was given seven points on his licence. He was also ordered to pay a £750 fine, £100 costs and a £75 victim surcharge.

Smith, of Eight Acres, Hindhead, was banned from driving for 28 days, fined £350 and ordered to pay £85 costs and a £35 victim surcharge.

Inspector Phil Nicholas said: ‘This manner of driving has unfortunately become increasingly common in the area of the A24 Great Daux roundabout. 

Police caught this Toyota Supra on camera racing around the A24 in Horsham. Drivers Danny Neville, 54,  and William Smith, 22, were prosecuted for driving without due care and attention

‘This has had a massive impact not only on other drivers, but on the victims in their own homes who have been blighted by the noise of this activity for many years.

‘The court case has shown that we take all manners of antisocial driving seriously and are willing to prosecute drivers who show no regard for the safety of themselves or other road users.

‘It sends out the message that if you drive irresponsibly on the streets of Sussex, to the annoyance of not only other road users and residents, we will use everything possible to take you to court.’

A police spokesperson added: 'They used the A24 as a stunt track and were prosecuted.'
