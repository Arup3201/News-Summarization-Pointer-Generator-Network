These fascinating pictures show the first time a great white shark has been caught and tagged in Cape Cod before being released back into the deep.

A team of scientists and fishermen screwed satellite and acoustic tags on to the dangerous predator's dorsal fin in just 15 minutes, on a platform of their former crabbing vessel in the Atlantic off Massachusetts, U.S.

These will track the 2,000-pound creature's movements through the ocean and - along with blood and tissue samples collected - should explain some of the many mysteries surrounding the great white.

Shark expert Greg Skomal admitted he 
was 'nervous' when the Ocearch crew caught the 15-foot-long animal, because of the 
research organisation's unorthodox methods.

While other teams tag great whites using harpoons, Ocearch baits the fish and leads them on to a large platform that lifts them out of the water.

The work is dangerous for both man and 
fish, with one shark dying on the lift in South Africa. The crew has to complete its work within just 15 minutes.

The sharks are attracted to the ship using 'chum' - bait made from fish parts, whale blubber  and blood - which is placed a mile from the Ocearch vessel.

Smaller boats circle the area looking for great whites - and one group got lucky last Thursday evening.

Worth the risk: Ocearch's will now be able to track 'Genie', named for famed shark researcher Eugenie Clark

They hooked the shark, leading it four miles to the 126-foot Ocearch.

Captain
Brett McBride guided the shark on to the wooden platform with metal 
sides. He jumped in barefoot and the lift rose out of the water until it
was level with Ocearch's deck.

The shark thrashed and bared her teeth as the water receded, curving her head and tail into the air.

Captain McBride threw a wet towel over her eyes and removed the two-foot hook 
from her mouth. He pumped water over her gills with two large hoses.

The crew jumped on to the lift in jeans and long-sleeve shirts, and the clock began.

They
measured the fish - 14 feet, 8 inches and 2,292 pounds - and screwed 
the satellite tag, an accelerometer and an acoustic tag on to her dorsal
fin with a power drill. Researchers collected blood and tissue samples.

Captain McBride named the female shark Genie after renowned shark researcher Eugenie Clark.

After nearly 15 minutes, everybody scrambled off as the lift was lowered back into the water.

Captain McBride grabbed Genie's tail and slowly guided her back into the ocean.
They were done in 16 minutes flat. Genie drifted down into the dark 
water. The crew clinked beer cans and soda cups.

'That
one shark alone was worth the trip,' said Captain McBride, noting that 
she might lead researchers to breeding and birthing sites. 'Any time we 
tag a great white shark it adds tremendous information to what we 
already know, which is very little.' 

Luring them in: Ocearch crew members drop chum - whale blubber and fish parts - to the bottom of the Atlantic Ocean to attract great white sharks

Teamwork: Ocearch Captain Brett McBride and Co-Captain Jody Whitworth tie strips of fish to a cooler containing whale blubber and send in down to the ocean floor, left, while expedition leader Chris Fischer applies sunscreen before leaving the ship to check chum locations for signs of activity

The crew, led by Chris Fischer, is mainly made up of sport fishermen and is funded by sponsors and  donors. A previous expedition in South Africa was the subject of the History channel's Shark Wranglers.

Ocearch is in Cape Cod for a 
few weeks to help 
shed light on the sharks' migration patterns, protect breeding and 
birthing sites, improve public safety and raise awareness about the 
threatened species that is a rising presence in the area.

'We have massive knowledge gaps about how to protect their future,' said Mr Fischer.

'I used to be nervous of what they'd do to me,' said co-captain Jody Whitworth. 'Now I worry that we'll hurt them.'

While great white sightings have risen near Cape Cod, they are much more common off South Africa or Australia.

Mr Skomal estimates that 30 great whites roam the Cape Cod coast on any given day. The Ocearch crew hopes to tag five.

Bravery: The small boats used to find the elusive great whites are not much bigger than the 15ft creature itself

Thrilling moment: A small boat team spotted the shark last Thursday evening and lured it back to their ship

'These predators keep the next lower level in check,' said Bob Hueter, of Mote Marine Laboratory, one of the research organisations working with the Cape Cod expedition. 'It's a system of checks and balances.'

The great white is the 'lion of the ocean,' keeping seal, squid and fish populations in check, Mr Fischer said. But it is also the shark that people are most interested in, making it a gateway for ocean conservation and advocacy, he said.

Ocearch's real-time satellite tags 
last five years. Each time sharks' dorsal fins breaks the surface, the 
tags ping a satellite and mark an online map, accessible to researchers 
and the public. 

Genie has pinged several times in the waters off Nantucket. So far, she is the crew's only catch.
