A 23-year-old man and his parents have been left with a  debilitating gastric illness after falling ill during a dream family holiday to Egypt almost two years ago. 

The Wheeldon family, from Hoddesdon, Herts, travelled to the Resta Grand Resort in Marsa Alam for what they hoped would be a relaxing two-week break in July 2013. 

But the family became alarmed at the apparent lack of food hygiene when Reece, his parents, two siblings and his girlfriend fell ill with severe diarrhoea, stomach cramps and headaches shortly after their arrival at the resort.

Since returning from their nightmare holiday, Reece has been diagnosed with Irritable Bowel Syndrome, while his parents continue to suffer from painful side effects. 

'We were all concerned by the food hygiene standards and we felt that the facilities were shabby and not what you might expect from a five-star resort,' says Reece, who works as an administrator.

'We tried to make the best of things, but in the second week it was as if we were dropping like flies, one by one falling ill with horrendous symptoms. It was an absolute nightmare.'

The family believes that under-cooked  chicken from a barbecue may have been to blame for their illness.

The family of six were travelled to the Resta Grand Resort in Marsa Alam for what they hoped would be a relaxing two-week break in July 2013

'I have been diagnosed with IBS which means I now have to be more careful about the foods I eat and it can be very restrictive and my mum and dad have also still got some symptoms.' adds Reece.

The tour operator TUI UK Ltd has now admitted liability, allowing the family to pursue a legal complaint and seek to compensation for their misery.

'We are pleased that the tour operator has admitted liability as it means we are now one step closer to gaining justice,' say Reece.

'However, nothing can turn back the clock and we hope that improvements to hygiene practices at the hotel are made to prevent another family from having to suffer like we have.'
