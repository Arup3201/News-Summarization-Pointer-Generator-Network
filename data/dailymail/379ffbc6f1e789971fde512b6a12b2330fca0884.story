Only 6 per cent of those questioned would trust the Secretary of State for Education Michael Gove

Parents are concerned about the effect the Government is having on their child's education, a poll suggests.

Around one in 12 (8 per cent) parents think that the coalition has had a positive impact on the education system since it took power, while almost half (44 per cent) said the impact has been negative.

The survey of around 2,000 adults, commissioned by the National Union of Teachers (NUT), indicates that the majority would entrust their child's education to school leaders.

Asked who, other than themselves, they trust the most to educate their son or daughter, more than half (59 per cent) of those questioned said head teachers, followed by the local authority (16 per cent) and school governors (13 per cent).

Around 6 per cent said they would trust the Secretary of State for Education, a post currently held by Michael Gove, and the same proportion said they would trust an academy chain.

The poll also reveals that just 2 per cent believe politicians should be able to prescribe what teachers teach, while a third (35 per cent) said teachers should be able to exercise their professional judgment to meet the needs of their pupils.

The survey comes as the NUT meets for its annual conference in Liverpool.

NUT general secretary Christine Blower said: 'The fact that only 8 per cent of parents think that the Government has had a positive impact on the education system is very significant.'

She added: 'It appears that it is now only the Secretary of State who believes that his policies are taking education in the right direction. Michael Gove's proposals for examination reform, the national curriculum and academies and free schools are all being questioned.'

The poll shows that Mr Gove 'does not have the confidence of the profession or parents', Ms Blower said.

Parents were also asked if they were in favour of the Government's plans to allow schools to decide on teachers' pay - a key issue in the NUT's current dispute with the Government.

One in four (25 per cent) said that every school should have to set its own pay system, while 60% were in favour of a national pay system for all teachers.

Ms Blower acknowledged that the survey had not asked parents if they would back teachers if they proceeded with strike action over pay. The NUT and NASUWT teaching unions are proposing to stage a series of regional walkouts, followed by a national stoppage before Christmas in a continuing row over pay, pensions and workload.

She said that if they were to ask 'do you want your child's teacher to go on strike?'the 'greatest likelihood' is that they would say no.

General Secretary of the NUT Christine Blower said that strike action disrupts a child's education and should be avoided when possible

'Strike action inconveniences people,' Ms Blower said.

But she added that the action was not just about pay and pensions, but also workload and "the umbrella question underlying it, which is, 'is what's being done to your children's education the right thing?'."

Ms Blower said the NUT is planning a series of rallies to meet parents, governors and young people to ask, "do you think what's going on in education is right?".

A Department for Education spokesman said: 'This survey in fact demonstrates the high level of parental support for our reforms.

'Almost two-thirds of parents want heads and teachers running their schools, rather than councils - that is why we have given schools more freedom than ever before to do just that through our academies programme.

'Our new national curriculum will be significantly slimmer than the current one, and does not tell teachers how to teach its content - this poll finds that 98 per cent of parents support us in that.

'Additionally, the vast majority of our new free schools are so popular with parents that they are over-subscribed.

'There is much to do but our package of reforms will again give all parents the confidence that their child is receiving the first-class education they deserve.'

The YouGov poll questioned 2,008 adults between March 12 and 18.
