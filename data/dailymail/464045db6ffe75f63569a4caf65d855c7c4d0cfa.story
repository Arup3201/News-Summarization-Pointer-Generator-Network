It is the elite gentleman’s establishment whose members have included Beau Brummell, Winston Churchill and innumerable politicians and aristocrats.

Now the historic Boodle’s Club is at the centre of an intrigue that has embroiled Ukip leader Nigel Farage, scandal-hit Tory MP Brooks Newmark and a peer accused of being a Government spy.

The Mail on Sunday has learned that Mr Newmark, who resigned from the Commons last weekend for sending X-rated pictures of himself, met Mr Farage for lunch at Boodle’s in early July – at a time when the Ukip leader was trying to woo disaffected Tory MPs to his party.

Food for thought: Brooks Newmark, left, and Nigel Farage, right, who met for lunch at Boodle's Club in early July

Despite the discreet venue, the pair were being watched: Mr Newmark, a Boodle’s member, had barely finished his meal at the 250-year-old club in St James’s, Central London, when he received a call from David Cameron’s Chief of Staff, Old Etonian Ed Llewellyn.

Mr Llewellyn growled: ‘Brooks, you are very unwise to have lunch with Farage so close to a reshuffle.’

The nature of Mr Newmark’s exchanges with Mr Farage and Mr Llewellyn has remained private.

But it was followed by a sudden – if short-lived – turnaround in Mr Newmark’s political fortunes.

Just two weeks after they dined, Mr Newmark, a previously rebellious malcontent who was sacked from the Whips’ Office last year, received a surprise promotion to Minister for Civil Society.

A number of disaffected Tory MPs suspected of ‘flirting’ with Ukip have been subject to a No 10 charm offensive, including offers of career advancement designed to stop them from joining Douglas Carswell and Mark Reckless in defecting.

Last night Mr Farage declined to reveal the content of his discussion with Mr Newmark. He said: ‘I meet a lot of MPs.’

So how did No 10 find out about the Newmark-Farage summit?

Boodle's Gentleman's club in St James, central London, is now at the centre of the scandal involving Farage

Friends of Mr Newmark accused the moustachioed Tory peer Lord Lexden, who was also dining at Boodle’s that day, of ‘grassing him up’ to Downing Street. Lord Lexden, 69, a veteran Tory fixer and official historian of the Conservative Party, is a long-term ally of Mr Llewellyn.

Last night the peer admitted: ‘It was indeed brought to my attention that Mr Farage and Mr Newmark were having lunch together across the room. But I am an old-fashioned gentleman who doesn’t carry a mobile phone, so it would have been impossible for me to have tipped off Downing Street within that timeframe.

‘I do know Mr Llewellyn, or rather Ed as I prefer to call him, but I didn’t tell him about the lunch. Not guilty!’

Boodle’s was founded in 1762 by the future Prime Minister Lord Shelburne and named after original head waiter Edward Boodle. It was the model for ‘Blades’ in the James Bond books, written by club member Ian Fleming, while other members have included economist Adam Smith, anti-slavery campaigner William Wilberforce and actor David Niven. Mr Newmark, 56, was handed his new ministerial responsibility on July 15; the day before he made the catastrophic decision to send a semi-naked self-portrait, while clad in Paisley pyjamas, to an undercover male reporter posing as a blonde PR girl.

When the story emerged on the first day of last month’s Conservative Party Conference – the same day as Mr Reckless’s defection – Mr Newmark resigned his ministerial post.

Last weekend he announced that he would also be quitting the Commons at the next Election after it emerged that he had sent other naked ‘selfies’ to a woman with whom he had been having an affair. He wrote in The Mail on Sunday of ‘battling demons’.

Ukip will target Mr Newmark’s Braintree seat, in its Essex heartland, hoping that the scandalous nature of the MP’s downfall will swell the party’s support.

Mr Newmark declined to comment last night.
