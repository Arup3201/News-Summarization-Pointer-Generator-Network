Sentenced: Stefan Fry, 18, inspired by the Yorkshire Ripper, has been jailed for four years, after assaulting a woman with a hammer

A teenager who was obsessed with the Yorkshire Ripper carried out copycat attacks on lone women while armed with a hammer.

Stefan Fry, 18,  was jailed for four years at Dorchester Crown Court last week.

The court heard he researched mass murderer Peter Sutcliffe extensively before he stalked his two victims as they walked alone in secluded parks.

He crept up on 37-year-old dog walker Gemma Thompson and struck her twice on the head with a hammer.

He then fled the scene, dropping the weapon along the way.

Two months earlier the teenager attacked 32-year-old Maria Clarke while she walked along an alleyway.

Fry punched her in the face and was beaten off when Miss Clark lashed out at him with her umbrella. 

He also left a hammer at the scene as he ran off.

A year before the two attacks the 
supermarket worker was stopped and searched by the police after a 
frightened women reported that he had been following her.

Fry was caught after Mrs Thompson 
managed to remember part of his car registration number despite 
being beaten with a hammer.

In interview Fry confessed that his interest in the Yorkshire Ripper had influenced him to carry out the attacks.

Detectives said there was a worrying escalation in the severity of the offences and they believe he could have gone on to kill had he not been stopped.

In jailing him, judge Roger Jarvis described the attacks as ‘deeply disturbing.’

He said: 'You were plainly influenced by your fascination with serious crime, your searching on the internet for the Yorkshire Ripper and having a book on him.

'Everybody who looks at this must reach the view that you were experimenting at acting out the man’s acts.'

A court heard that Fry’s first attack happened on December 15 last year in Dorchester, Dorset.

Detective Chief Inspector Paul Powley, of Dorset police, said: 'She walked passed him and thought there was something not quite right.

'As she turned around he punched her in the face. She fought him off with an umbrella she was carrying otherwise it could have been a lot worse.'

He said a hammer was later found hanging on a fence near the scene.

On February 22 this year, Fry followed Mrs Thompson as she walked a friend’s dog in woods at Langdon Hill, Bridport.

She had just put the dogs in the boot of the car when she heard Fry’s footsteps on the gravel behind her.

DCI Powley said: 'She was twice struck from behind to the back of the head. Luckily she didn’t suffer serious injuries, just bruising.

'She had the presence of mind to take a registration number which we are very thankful for.

'There was an escalation of violence in her case and there is little doubt that Fry was in his infancy of his crimes.

'I think he was progressing and pushing the boundaries. Had we not caught him when we did, goodness knows what he would have gone on to do.

'He appears to have come from a normal family background but somewhere along the line he became infatuated by Peter Sutcliffe.

'The public are now protected as a result of him being put in prison.

'It is thanks to the courage of the victims and the tenacity of the investigative team that Fry is now serving that prison sentence.'

Carolyn Branford-Wood, prosecuting, said Fry made no secret of his interest in the Yorkshire Ripper.

She said: 'Asked about the use of the hammer on the two occasions he said he obtained that idea from reading books and also research on the internet about the Yorkshire Ripper.

'He thought it was a large blunt instrument that would have a visual impact on his victims.'

Sutcliffe was caught after one of the most notorious murder hunts in British criminal history.

It was on July 5, 1975, just 11 months after he married, that Sutcliffe first attacked a woman with a hammer.

He said he believed he was on a 'mission from God' to kill prostitutes - although not all of his victims were.

He became known as the Yorkshire Ripper after mutilating their bodies with a hammer, a sharpened screwdriver and a knife.

Charles Gabb, defending, told Dorchester Crown Court the attacks had been a ‘desperate cry’ for attention.

He said Fry had felt he had under-achieved throughout his life.

He added: 'The aim was to frighten and scare, not to do anything else.'

Judge Jarvis said Fry needed to receive help in prison before being released into society.

He said: 'There is plainly a secretive part of your character where you keep some part of your personality hidden from those who think they know you well.

'It seems to me you need to spend a significant amount of time in custody so there is a clear understanding of your motivation and you receive all the help that is available in erasing those dangerous impulses.'

Fry, from Bridport, pleaded guilty to two counts of assaults occasioning actual bodily harm and two offences of possessing an offensive weapon.
