A shocked mother was furious after a talking toy she bought her nine-year-old daughter taught her to say: 'f*** you.' 

Louise Wilkinson, 42, bought two of the £15 popular Furby toys as a treat for her daughter Monet and her grandchildren Tia, four, and Shannon, three.

But she was stunned when one of the little bundles of fluff blurted out the words: 'f*** you' after pressing the button on its back at her home on Monday.

And now she says her young daughter will not stop repeating the obscenities while walking around the house in Llanfyllin, Powys in Wales.

The interactive toys are designed to pick up words that are spoken to them, but Ms Wilkinson insists she hadn’t sworn at them as they were newly out of the packet.

Hotel housekeeper Ms Wilkinson said she wanted to warn other parents about the foul-mouthed Furby, which she bought from Argos, in Oswestry, Shropshire.

Louise has now taken the toys from her children as a precaution and is complaining to the company that manufacturers them.

She said: 'I was in shock as I couldn’t believe what I was hearing.

'My daughter picked up on it straight away and now she keeps saying it. It’s not funny because it could stay with her and she’ll say it at school.

'She keeps on walking around saying ‘f**k you, f**k you. I’m not a fan of swearing as it is but especially not when it's coming from the mouth of your own child.

'Only one of the Furbies swears, but we've had to confiscate the other because it wouldn't be fair.

'The children are so upset.

'Other parents needs to be aware this could happen. It’s not right.'

Ms Wilkinson does not think the glitch is deliberate because she cannot tell what the toy is saying.

She said:'I don’t think it’s a prank by a factory worker because it isn’t obvious what it's saying.

'But it’s obvious enough for my daughter to pick up a horrible phrase like that and something needs to be done.'

Argos is investigating the complaint.

A spokesperson said: 'We have robust processes in place to ensure the toys we sell are safe and appropriate for children.'

It is not the first time Furbies have been caught swearing and the internet includes a number of sites in which tips are given on how to teach the toys naughty words.

Tens of millions of Furbies have been sold since they were launched in 1998, when they were the biggest selling toy of the year.

The toys - which saw a huge revival in 2012 - are capable of talking in 24 languages.
