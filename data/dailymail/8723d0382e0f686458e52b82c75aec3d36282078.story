Warren Jupiter's family has been awarded $5.9m in damages following his death

The children of a US veteran who died from gastric bypass surgery which went horribly wrong could be denied a payout of nearly $1m because the Government believes he was abusive and set a bad example to them.

Father-of-three Warren Jupiter, from New York, died after developing a gastric leak which went undetected for months following the surgery at the Manhattan VA Hospital.

Last week the federal government was ordered to pay $5m to his widow and an additional $900,000, which was to be split among his three grown-up children.

The government is now reportedly considering appealing the $900,000 payout because he called his son a 'homo', refused to pay for his Bar Mitzvah and made obscene gestures when he felt they were ignoring him.

On Thursday Brooklyn Federal Judge Leo Glasser ruled it was 'inexplicable and inexcusable' doctors failed to detect the leak in the 35 stone cab driver because did not think he would fit inside a CT scan chamber.

But according to the New York Daily News, court papers filed after the 2010 trial saw government lawyers argue his children should not receive any money for damages as he was abusive and irresponsible.

They also argued his bizarre behaviour set a bad example to his children.

The children have claimed they had a close relationship with Mr Jupiter, but the government has said his odd behaviour included upsetting his daughter by urinating in the back yard when he was unable to use the bathroom.

The court papers also say he laughed when leaving human waste on the walls and floor of the bathroom and eventually moved out of the apartment in Manhattan because his wife said he unhyienic.

The government's lawyers argued: 'Mr. Jupiter offered no meaningful support or guidance to his children at any age, and could not have been expected to provide guidance to his now adult children in the future.'

A Brooklyn US Attorny's office spokesman has said the ruling was being reviewed.

Mr Jupiter was admitted to the government-run Manhattan VA Hospital in April 2003 when it became apparent his huge bulk was a threat to his life.

The 2010 court hearing heard how when he failed to recover, his family had to watched as he wasted away before his death at a nursing home in the Bronx two years later.

His daughter Hannah, 21 at the time, told the hearing: ‘There were times I would visit him... his air bed was deflated and he was sunken in and couldn't move’.
