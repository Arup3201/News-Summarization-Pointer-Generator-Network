A yacht bobbing on the Mediterranean is dwarfed by a furious waterspout in this incredible picture.

Holidaymaker Isabelle Filippini had been admiring the calm sea off the coast of the French island of Corsica when the enormous, powerful vortex formed above the surface of the water.

Mrs Filippini, who ran to grab her camera, said witnessing the phenomenon had left her stunned.

Waterspout: The enormous vortex appeared over the sea off the coast of the French island of Corsica

'My family and I had been admiring the sea, despite the low clouds,' said Mrs Filippini, 43.

'Then all of a sudden one of the clouds was pointing towards the sea and I realised it was forming a tornado. I was amazed as the waterspout touched the sea,' she said.

'On the ground everything was quiet - the weather had been stormy for a few days but there was no strong wind and no rain. I ran to catch my camera, changed my lens and caught a classic view of the spout.'

Waterspouts occur when tornadoes form over oceans, lakes and rivers.

The intense funnels are formed when 
layers of cool air blowing over the water cause warm, moist air to sweep
up from underneath, forming a column of condensation.

The tornadoes can pose a threat to boats, swimmers and aircraft in their path.

Phenomenon: Stunned holidaymaker Isabelle Filippini captured the natural display on camera

The mother-of-one snapped the pictures during a visit to her parents' seaside home north of Bastia, on Corsica.

'I have spent my holidays in Corsica since I was born, but never saw such a tornado,' she said.

'I'm so amazed I got this photo of the boat in front of the huge water spout - they must have been so scared.'

Despite having never spotted one of the phenomena in the past, Mrs Fillipini witnessed two on the day she took the photos.

'I don't think I will ever see anything like it again. It seems to be quite rare, but happens sometimes in the Mediterranean.

The tornado lasted around 10 minutes and then disappeared. About 20 minutes later, another appeared to the south, close to another boat.

'This one was even quicker,' Mrs Filippini, a computing company worker living near Paris, France, said.

'I managed to shoot it just once, and it faded just after.'
