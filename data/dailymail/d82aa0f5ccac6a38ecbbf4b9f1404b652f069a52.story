One lucky waitress who has always dreamed of visiting Italy
where her family is from is now able to do so after a customer left her a
$1,000 tip for the trip.

In a post on Tumblr, the daughter of the waitress recounted the
story. She said that her mom was talking with a man she waited on and told him
that her family is from Florence and she has always wanted to go there.

A man left a waitress a $1000 tip at a restaurant so she could go on her first trip to Italy

‘She’s got 8 years of art education and she’s working a
waitress,’ the daughter, who is a waitress at the same restaurant, wrote. ‘It’s
pretty…sad and disappointing I guess.’

The daughter, who does not identify either her, her
mother or the restaurant they work at, goes on to say that her parents divorced six years ago and her mom ‘hasn’t
had a real job ever.’ She adds they have been stuck in a small town.

The lucky waitress will be able to see some of Italy's most famous sites, such as the Colosseum in Rome

The man who tipped the mother $1,000 just walked out without
saying he left the gigantic gratuity on his credit card slip. He simply wrote, ‘Your
ticket to Italy. Enjoy!!’
