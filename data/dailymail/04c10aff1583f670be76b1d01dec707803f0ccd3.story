A race against time is taking place to extract oil from a massive container ship stranded in New Zealand due to concerns of a major ecological disaster.

The 775-foot Liberia-flagged 'Rena' struck the Astrolabe Reef about 12 nautical miles from Tauranga Harbour early on Wednesday, and has been foundering there since.

The ship has been leaking fuel, leading to fears of a major environmental disaster if it breaks up further.

Maritime New Zealand (MNZ) said in a statement today that a barge, the Awanuia, has pulled up alongside the Rena and should soon begin pumping fuel from the stricken ship.

Despite initial thoughts that any leaks of oil had stopped, a new patch of fresh oil has been sighted on the surface of the sea.

Officials now estimate that 10 tons of oil have leaked from the vessel.

The operation to extract the oil from the ship is expected to last at least two days, although it could be delayed by bad weather.

So far, eight birds suffering the effects of the oil spill have been found and helped.

The ship has been listing violently to one side since it became trapped.

Its cargo of 2,000 containers can be seen balancing precariously on deck.

None of the 25 crew members have been injured.

MNZ spokesman Renny van der Velde, speaking shortly after the Rena became stranded, said: 'There is significant flooding in two cargo holds, there is a significant amount of water, some pumping has occurred and is ongoing.'

Refloating the vessel is the responsibility of the owners and salvage experts, but any plan would need official approval.

Mr van der Velde said: 'The
 vessel is hard and dry on the reef so it may take some time, certainly 
from current indications this will be an ongoing and quite a long 
process.'

He said it was not yet known how the ship came to hit the reef.

The Rena, operated by the Mediterranean 
Shipping Co, was headed for Tauranga to load further cargo.

Tauranga, 120 miles south east of New Zealand's biggest city, Auckland, is one of the the country's largest ports.

The district is a popular holiday resort, with long beaches renowned for surfing.
