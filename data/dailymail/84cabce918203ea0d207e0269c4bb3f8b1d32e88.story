David Cameron today puts the prospect of Alex Salmond ‘calling the tune’ in a deal with Labour at the centre of the Tory election campaign.

As he launches a poster showing a tiny Ed Miliband in Mr Salmond’s pocket, the Prime Minister warns of the ‘chilling and real prospect’ of Labour being propped up in government by the Scottish National Party.

His offensive comes after a day in which four members of Labour’s shadow cabinet refused repeatedly to say whether they would do a deal with the SNP in the event of a hung parliament.

Pocket-size: Ed Miliband is dwarfed by Alex Salmond in the new Conservative election poster

Polls last week suggested the nationalists could win 50 out of the 59 Westminster seats in May, including those seen as the safest Labour strongholds such as Gordon Brown’s in Kirkcaldy. This would sink any prospect of Mr Miliband winning a Commons majority. 

Mr Cameron says today: ‘Britain needs to wake up to a chilling and real prospect – Ed Miliband as prime minister, propped up by Alex Salmond who says he’ll call the tune.

‘Again and again, Ed Miliband refuses to rule out this possibility. He is so weak, everyone knows he would be in Alex Salmond’s pocket. On every vote, every budget, every decision, the SNP would exact a high price for his support.

‘Everyone in Britain will pay with higher taxes, more spending, more debt and weaker defences in dangerous times. To keep the recovery on track and avoid this nightmare, vote Conservative.’

A Labour parliamentary candidate has rejected a £1,000 donation from Tony Blair towards her election campaign.

Lesley Brennan, who is standing in Dundee East, said on Twitter her ‘instinct’ was to turn the offer down. 

The former Prime Minister has pledged £106,000 to help Labour campaigns in 106 marginal seats. 

But there has been unease about Mr Blair’s links to foreign corporations and dictatorships and candidates have been under pressure to hand back the so-called ‘blood money’.

Mr Miliband is under huge pressure from his Scottish MPs to rule out a deal with the nationalists.

Yesterday his deputy Harriet Harman dodged the issue eight times on the Murnaghan show on Sky. Labour energy spokesman Caroline Flint refused four times to rule out a deal with the nationalists on the Andrew Marr Show on BBC1.

She said: ‘We are focused on winning a Labour majority government. Let me say this. We do not want, we do not need and we do not plan to have any coalition with the SNP.’

Shadow justice secretary Sadiq Khan dodged the question four times on Pienaar’s Politics on Radio 5 Live and shadow Scotland secretary Margaret Curran did so nine times on the BBC’s Sunday Politics.

On Friday, Mr Salmond, the former SNP leader who is expected to lead the party in Westminster after the election, said Scotland could ‘call the tune’ in the Commons.

‘It is now clear that neither Tory nor Labour will win an overall majority,’ he said. ‘Neither are fit to govern.

‘It is also clear that Scotland is swinging behind SNP candidates the length and breadth of the country. In that situation Scotland can call the tune in the next Westminster Parliament.’

At the same time, Scottish First Minister Nicola Sturgeon removed the biggest obstacle to a Labour-SNP deal by ditching her red line on Trident. She said her party could back a minority Labour government in key votes even if it had not secured an agreement to scrap the nuclear deterrent.

Labour MPs say the party has ‘decided internally’ not to rule out an SNP pact before the election.

This will be particularly concerning to English voters who fear the price of concessions the SNP will seek to extract from Labour in return for handing Mr Miliband the keys to No 10.

Peeping from the breast pocket of a giant Alex Salmond, Ed Miliband is portrayed as a mere plaything of the SNP in the Tories’ latest poster.

Lips pursed, he appears pensive and childlike as the larger-than-life Scottish nationalist looks down on him with a patronising smirk.

The poster’s clear aim is to suggest Mr Salmond will have free rein to boss Mr Miliband around if their parties form a coalition in May. Last night the pair were immediately dubbed ‘Big Eck and Little Ed’.

The Tory campaign drew comparisons to ITV’s Spitting Image, which mercilessly lampooned politicians in the 1980s and 1990s. Its targets included David Owen and David Steel, joint leaders of the SDP/Liberal Alliance. 

Mr Steel was lampooned as Mr Owen’s adoring sidekick and sometimes appeared in his pocket, left.
