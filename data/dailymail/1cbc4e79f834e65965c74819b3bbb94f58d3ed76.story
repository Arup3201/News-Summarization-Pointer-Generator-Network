Lewis Hamilton, the Sunday specialist, will have to pass Nico Rosberg to win the Brazilian Grand Prix after the German drove the fastest lap ever at Interlagos to take pole position.

Rosberg was fastest all weekend – in three practice sessions and the first two periods of qualifying. And, when it counted, he pipped Hamilton by three hundredths of a second with a nerveless final act in cloudy Sao Paulo.

His time of 1min 10.023sec eclipsed the previous lap best set here by Rubens Barrichello of 1min 10.646sec for Ferrari in 2006.

Rosberg has now taken 10 pole positions to Hamilton’s seven, a remarkable record given that no previous team-mate has outperformed Hamilton, the acknowledged one-lap specialist, in qualifying over a season.

‘Perfect job if only it were tomorrow,’ said Rosberg. ‘I am in the best place but I have to make it count, which I didn’t do last time in Austin. I didn’t find my rhythm there but I am confident I can put that right.’

Yes, it is during races that Hamilton has proved the superior performer, having won 10 grands prix to Rosberg’s four. That gives the Briton a 24-point lead going into the penultimate round. Yet double scoring in Abu Dhabi in a fortnight leaves his title hopes vulnerable to a decisive mistake or a calamitous engine failure.

Back to Saturday's showing in Brazil, Hamilton explained that he lost a bit of time at turns one and 10 on his final flying lap, but said: ‘It is a long race and there should be two or three stops. There are opportunities throughout, not just at the start.

‘The Brazil race means more to me than any other one. It is a race I nearly won in 2012 but I got taken out. I remember watching Ayrton (Senna) race on this track when I was younger, and that makes it special.’

A random factor in this capricious climate is the ever-present danger of rain, and that could yet play havoc with the otherwise unassailable Mercedes of Hamilton and Rosberg.

Hamilton is 24 points ahead of Rosberg with two races remaining, but has never tasted victory in Brazil 

Someone who knows all about the local weather is Felipe Massa, who was supported warmly en route to an impressive third fastest for Williams. Every time he tore along the pit straight, his countrymen got to their feet, waved their hands in the air and let out a cheer that carried across the track to the media centre over the garages.

Jenson Button, who is due to leave McLaren at the end of the season to make way for Fernando Alonso, beat his team-mate Kevin Magnussen and will start fifth, two places ahead of the Dane.

Away from Sao Paulo, Caterham are trying to raise enough money to compete in Abu Dhabi. They have launched a ‘crowdfunding’ scheme by which supporters are urged to contribute a minimum of £10 in exchange for bits of old car.

So far the team, who are administration with debts of £16million, have raised £500,000 towards a target of £2.35million. Their deadline is next Friday and the clock is ticking loudly.

But F1’s puppeteer Bernie Ecclestone is unimpressed by the project. ‘I think it’s a disaster,’ he said. ‘We don’t want begging bowls. If people can’t afford to be in Formula One, they have to find something else to do.

‘If I sit in a poker game and I can’t afford to be there with the other people, I get killed and have to leave.

‘We give the teams nearly $900million (£561m) a year. We don’t spend it.

‘When I had a race team a few years ago, in fact a few hundred years ago, I used to run it according to how much money we could spend and we won the world championship.

‘That’s what they don’t do. They don’t seem to understand that somebody is going to be last.’

That someone in qualifying was Pastor Maldonado of Lotus. There were no surprises in the eight who fell out of the reckoning with him, leaving the 10 leading lights in the shootout for pole.

And, as is his consistent habit, Rosberg shone brightest at the sharp end of Saturday afternoon, at a record average speed of 138.45mph.
