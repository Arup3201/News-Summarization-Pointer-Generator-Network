Arthur Paintin, the captain's steward (seen here in a previously unpublished photo), said he hoped a near-collision Titanic had with another vessel when it left port was not a sign of things to come

A Titanic-headed letter by the captain’s personal steward in which he wrote of his fears that the doomed liner was cursed with bad luck is tipped to sell for £36,000.

In his note days before the ship sank, Arthur Paintin said he hoped a near-collision Titanic had with another vessel when it left port was not a sign of things to come.

Chillingly, he also told his parents in England that he expected to be away at sea all summer ‘bar accidents’.

Mr Paintin was very close to Captain Edward Smith and was last seen standing on the bridge next to him moments before the liner sank after hitting an iceberg in 1912.

When the ship docked at Queenstown, Ireland, three days before the disaster, Mr Paintin took the opportunity to post the letter to his parents in Oxford.

In it, he warned of how the Titanic may have been followed by bad luck associated with her sister ship the Olympic, which had accidentally collided with a battleship the year before.

He wrote: 'We have now commenced the quick voyages all the summer (bar accidents).

'I say that because the Olympic’s bad luck seems to have followed us.'

He then gave a detailed account of how the Titanic and the liner the New York nearly collided at Southampton on April 10.

In a well-documented near-miss, the New York slipped her moorings under the pressure of Titanic’s suction, causing it to drift towards the ‘unsinkable’ ship.

The letter has been handed down through Mr Paintin’s family over the last 100 years and is now being sold at auction by one of his direct descendants.

Also being sold is an unpublished photo of the steward which has been made available by the family.

Andrew Aldridge, of Henry Aldridge and Son of Devizes, said: 'Arthur Paintin worked under Captain Smith for several years on the Olympic and the captain had him transferred to Titanic to follow him.

'This is a man who knew Captain Smith better than most and was last seen by his side on the bridge when it sank.

'The content of the letter is superb.

'He questions whether the Titanic is cursed with bad luck, mentions the facilities on board and gives a very detailed account of the New York incident.

'On top of that, the letter is written in Titanic-headed notepaper and these letters are always in demand.'

Mr Paintin, from Southampton, was 29 when he was transferred on to Titanic for its maiden voyage to New York on April 10, 1912.

His job was to be at the beck and call of the white-whiskered captain who famously chose to go down with the ship when it sank during the early hours of April 15 with the loss of 1,522 lives.

Describing the ship, he wrote to his parents in Oxford: 'Bai jove [sic] what a fine ship this is, much better than the Olympic as far as passengers are concerned.

'But my little room is nothing near so nice, no daylight, electric light on all day, but I suppose it’s no use grumbling.

'I cannot realise that I had ten days at home, and am very sorry I could not get to Oxford for we have now commenced the quick voyages all the summer (bar accidents).

'I say that because the Olympic’s bad luck seems to have followed us for as we came out of Southampton dock this morning we passed quite close to the New York which was tiedup in the Adriatic’s old berth, and whether it was suction or what it was I don’t know, butthe New York’s ropes snapped like a piece of cotton and she drifted against us.

'There was great excitement for some little time, but I don’t think there was any damage done bar one or two people knocked over by the ropes.'

The auction takes place this Saturday.
