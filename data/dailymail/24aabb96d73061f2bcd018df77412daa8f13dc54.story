Extraordinary bravery: Marie Jalowicz Simon used cunning, guile and desperate pragmatism to stay one step ahead of her Nazi hunters, living in underground slums, on coal piles or the beds of not-so-kindly Berliners with a conscience. © Hermann Simon

For three years Marie Jalowicz Simon lived a life of isolation and fear in the dark heart of Nazism.

She was what the Gestapo called a  U-Boat, one of the scores of Jews who managed to survive out of sight beneath the surface of society.

Marie remained hidden for three years in Berlin and her battle to avoid capture and stay alive is told in a powerful new book, Submerged.

She died 15 years ago but the book, just published in Germany, is based on tape recordings she made about her time in hiding. ‘She became a submarine and she stayed  submerged and she lived,’ said her son Hermann.

From 80 cassette tapes, Hermann and author Irene Stratenwerth have produced what has been described as a masterpiece.

The book says that by 1941 both Marie’s parents were dead. She was 25 and working as a slave labourer at an arms factory in the capital.

By this time the Nazis’ plans for Jews had moved from deportation to slavery and eventual extermination. As time dragged on and workmates disappeared, she realised that she could be next. So she failed to turn up for work one day and then went to the forced labour office pretending to be a neighbour who said Marie Simon has been deported.

Despite her ruse, the Gestapo came looking for her and she had to go on the run. She said: ‘I did not want to belong to the community of death. I wanted to live.’

'Submerged': The title of  the book (left) is a reference to the names the Nazis gave Jews like her;  'U-Boats' who stayed hidden beneath the surface of a society that wanted to put them on to trains to concentration camps, then to gas chambers (right)

Slaves: Jewish slave labour girls line up for work. Marie Jalowicz Simon was 25 in 1941 when she started working as a slave labourer on a lather at a Siemens plant in the capital

She dyed her hair, scavenged a set of false papers and became known to the handful of Berliners who would give her shelter.

One
 night here, one night there, sometimes sleeping in a coal pile, other 
times surrendering to the advances of not-so-kindly helpers.

‘Not all motives were noble,’ she said. ‘I had to be pragmatic.’

She was alive when the city fell to the Red Army in May 1945.

‘The
 survival of every single submerged person was based on a chain of 
coincidences that was hard to believe and often wonderful,’ she said. ‘I
 lived on a tightrope.’

Terror: Had she been captured, she would most likely have ended up in a concentration camp like this at Auschwitz, where she would probably have been sent to a gas chamber

Almost nowhere to hide: While in hiding in Berlin, she had to keep a keen eye out for the 'catchers,' often Jews themselves, who were deployed by the Nazis to engage in conversation in parks, cafes and on the street with people they thought were other Jews on the run (this picture was taken in 1938)
