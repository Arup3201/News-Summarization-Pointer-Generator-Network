A baby who was diagnosed with cancer before she was even born has survived a dangerous operation and a gruelling round of chemotherapy, and has beaten the disease.

Doctors spotted a tennis ball sized tumour on Jenna Smith's neck when her mother was 32 weeks pregnant and operated to remove it days after she was born.

Now enjoying her first Christmas, the baby's cancer is finally in remission following weeks of chemotherapy.

Brave: Baby Jenna Smith, now nine months old, was born with an enormous tumour on her neck

Her mother Lisa, 38, who lives in Penrith with husband Anthony, 38, said: 'It was such a massive shock to us both when we were told that Jenna had this neck cancer.

'She was still inside me and hadn’t even been born yet, yet I was being told that my baby had cancer. It was terrifying.

'When I saw the massive tumour on her neck when she was delivered, I couldn’t believe just how big it was. 

'She was such a tiny baby and yet she had this massive tumour on her neck. I just had to pray that she would be able to survive.'

Mrs Smith, 38, suffered a heartbreaking miscarriage two years before becoming pregnant with Jenna but her joy soon turned to terror.

Harrowing: Her parents Mark and Lisa Smith from Penrith feared their daughter might not survive

'I was overjoyed that I was pregnant again,' remembers Mrs Smith. I went for my scan at 12 weeks and doctors said there was a good strong heartbeat that that was a relief. 

'Then on the 20 week scan everything looked fine too so I was just looking forward to becoming a mum at last.'

After developing diabetes during the pregnancy, Mrs Smith had another scan at 32 weeks to make sure her daughter was developing normally - but was horrified when doctors spotted the tumour.

‘We were devastated when we were told what was the matter with our baby,' she says. 'We didn’t know whether she was even going to survive.’

Mrs Smith was referred to the Royal Victoria Infirmary in Newcastle and when her waters broke at 34 weeks in March, she was rushed straight into the operating theatre.

The birth proved equally traumatic, with doctors forced to cut a hole in Jenna's throat to insert a breathing tube midway through the delivery.

Beating the odds: The little girl had her first operation during birth and another a few days later

All gone: The tumour was successfully removed but baby Jenna had to begin a round of chemotherapy

‘It was so scary,' remembers her mother. 'They were operating on Jenna literally as she was half way through being born.’

After her birth, the tiny baby was taken straight to the intensive care unit. She had an operation to remove the tumour and initially tests came back showing that it was benign.

‘We were so relieved at first because we were told it wasn’t cancer,' says Mrs Smith. 'We thought we could just take her home and get on with our lives and put all this behind us.’

But a few weeks later, the couple got a call from the hospital to say that further tests had shown that the tumour was cancerous.

Jenna, who is now nine months old, had to be taken back into hospital to begin months of gruelling chemotherapy treatment to stop the cancer spreading.

Survivor: The nine-month-old girl has beaten off the disease and celebrated her first Christmas last week

Happy: Despite the chemotherapy, Jenna's mother says she remains a happy and smiling baby

She has scans once a month at the hospital to check her progress.

‘She has been tired and exhausted with the chemotherapy treatment,' says her mother. 'But in-between her chemotherapy she is still a happy and smiling baby.’

With just two more weeks of chemotherapy treatment to go, the future looks brighter and there is no sign of the tumour returning.

’We are very proud of her,' added Mrs Smith. 'Luckily when she grows up, she will be too young to remember everything that she has been through.

‘We will tell her when she’s old enough about how lucky she has been - to survive being born with cancer.’
