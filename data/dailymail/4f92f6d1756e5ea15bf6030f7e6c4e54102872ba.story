Vince Cable yesterday opened the door to a 'rainbow coalition' of Labour, the Lib Dems and the SNP following the General Election.

The Business Secretary went further than any other senior Westminster politician as he claimed a left-leaning pact between the three parties would be 'possible' if there is another hung parliament.

Labour leader Ed Miliband has played down the prospect of a deal with the resurgent SNP, but Mr Cable insisted there is 'no taboo' on the Nationalists.

However, he said whichever party has the most seats at Westminster should have the first opportunity to form a government. He went on to condemn recent remarks from First Minister Nicola Sturgeon, who said she would prop Labour up in Downing Street even if the Tories win the election.

Mr Cable was one of the key figures when the current Tory/Lib Dem coalition was formed in 2010, but has remained a critic of the Conservatives and is frequently tipped as his party's next leader.

In recent years, Labour has courted Mr Cable in the hope of forming a coalition with the Lib Dems after May's election, and Mr Miliband revealed in 2012 that he was in regular text message contact with the Cabinet minister.

But polls suggest the Lib Dems face an election drubbing, particularly in Scotland, and the SNP could emerge as the third largest force in UK politics. 

Miss Sturgeon – who insists she will lead post-election negotiations rather than Alex Salmond – has ruled out any deal with the Tories, yet is willing to prop up Mr Miliband in Number Ten.

In return, she wants the replacement programme for Trident nuclear missiles to be scrapped, an end to 'austerity' and sweeping new powers for Holyrood that critics fear would lead to 'independence by the back door'.

Senior Scottish Labour MPs are known to bitterly oppose the idea, but Mr Miliband has repeatedly declined to entirely rule out a post-election deal. 

Any pact would most likely would be a 'supply and demand' arrangement, ensuring budgets and other key pieces of legislation were passed rather than a formal coalition.

Speaking to journalists on a visit to Edinburgh yesterday, Mr Cable said: 'There is probably going to be an issue in the next parliament of minority government. We don't absolutely know, it could go all kind of different directions.

'When that happens there are all kind of different possibilities – coalition, support outside coalition - and I think any sensible party has to be willing to look at all those possibilities in an open-minded way. 

'What the country will need is stability, I don't think the electorate will be at all well-disposed to any party – whether it's one of the UK parties or the SNP – which aims to destabilise the government and runs back to the electorate after a few months.'

Asked about Miss Sturgeon's claim that she would do a deal with Labour even if it was the second largest party at Westminster, Mr Cable said: 'We adopt a different approach – we think you have to show respect for the electorate.

'You have to respect the principle that the party with the largest number of seats at Westminster has a basic legitimacy. That's where we started from in 2010.'

Quizzed on the possibility of the Lib Dems working with the SNP, he continued: 'We're perfectly happy to work with the SNP. There's no taboo on the SNP. 

'The party we had the greatest degree of difference from were the Tories, but given the reality of the situation in 2010 – the need for a stable government, the extreme nature of the economic crisis – we worked together in a business-like way and we would approach the SNP in precisely the same way.'

Asked if a 'rainbow coalition' with Labour, the SNP and the Lib Dems is therefore a possibility, Mr Cable replied: 'It's possible. We're not leaning in one direction or the other, we're trying to be equidistant between the parties and leave the public to decide which direction they go, but certainly that kind of arrangement would be possible – I certainly wouldn't rule it out.'

Mr Cable insisted the Lib Dems will not get wiped out north of the Border, despite polls suggesting that Chief Secretary to the Treasury Danny Alexander and Women's Minister Jo Swinson could be out of a job.

'I think we'll get far more MPs back than the polls are indicating at the moment,' he said.

'These average figures, which I know are quite low in Scotland, don't actually tell you the underlying trend about what's happening in Argyll or Aberdeenshire or Edinburgh West. I think the vast majority of our colleagues will get back.

'[For Danny Alexander] it's an uphill struggle. But he's got a very high profile, he's delivered a lot for his area as well as across the UK, so I would include him in the category of people who when it comes to the crunch, people will look at the individual and their record as an MP and I'm pretty confident we shall see them back.'

The Business Secretary went on to criticise Miss Sturgeon's recent bid to delay plans to cut Britain's deficit and spend an extra £180billion over four years, in return for SNP support in the Commons.

'I'm not sure that delay is a good doctrine in itself,' he said. 'You've got to face the realities.

'I think if [the SNP] did find themselves in government, they would find themselves making some very difficult decisions. Any responsible government has to deal with very large deficits.'

Last night, SNP Westminster leader Angus Robertson said: 'A strong team of SNP MPs will be a progressive force for change across the UK, standing up for Scotland's interests and an alternative to austerity focused on jobs, growth and fairness.

'Unlike the Lib Dems, we have made clear that we will never help the Tories into government - and having played their part in inflicting devastating cuts over the last five years, the Lib Dems must now answer to the electorate in May.'

A spokesman for the Scottish Labour Party said: 'In every election since the 1930s the biggest party has formed the government. This election is about evicting David Cameron from Downing St and only the Labour Party can do that. 

'A vote for any other party makes it get more likely that the Tories will be the biggest party, and David Cameron will get into government through the back door.'
