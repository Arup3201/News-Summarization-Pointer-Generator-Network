FIFA has banned former Greece coach Fernando Santos for eight international matches for verbally abusing match officials at the World Cup.

Santos, a 59-year-old Portuguese, was sent from the dug-out after extra time of Greece's last-16 match against Costa Rica. The match finished 1-1 and Costa Rica went on to win on penalties.

FIFA said in a statement: 'Fernando Santos is suspended for eight matches...for displaying several acts of unsporting conduct towards the match officials.'

Banned: Former Greece coach Fernando Santos has been banned for eight international matches

Santos' contract expired after the World Cup in Brazil and his ban means he is unlikely to manage at international level again.

FIFA's disciplinary committee has also suspended Italy medical official Aldo Esposito for six matches.

Esposito was sent from the dug-out during Italy's 1-0 defeat to Uruguay, the match where Luis Suarez bit Italy defender Giorgio Chiellini.

Unfriendly: The ban came from him verbally abusing officials during the World Cup

Success: He led the Greeks to the last-16 of the tournament where they lost to Costa Rica on penalties

FIFA also confirmed that Suarez has eight matches from his nine-match international ban still remaining as well as a four-month ban from any football-related activity.

Suarez is appealing to the Court of Arbitration for Sport on Friday with a decision expected next week.
