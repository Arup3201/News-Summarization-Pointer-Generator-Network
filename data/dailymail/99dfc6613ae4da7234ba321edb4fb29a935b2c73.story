A couple who spent £20,000 on fertility treatment finally conceived thanks to a controversial treatment involving egg yolk and soya.

Cathy Garvey and her partner Dan Bowley spent six years trying for a baby.

Four rounds of IVF treatment failed, leaving the couple, from Birmingham, heartbroken.

But they finally achieved success after trying a new technique being pioneered in Britain.

Cathy Garvey and her partner Dan Bowley spent six years trying for a baby. After four unsuccessful rounds of IVF and £20,000 they eventually succeeded thanks to a pioneering treatment involving egg yolk and soya 

Called intravenous intralipid therapy, it is made from soya bean oil, egg yolk, glycerin and water and administered through an IV drip.

It works on the premise that some women are actually immune to pregnancy.

So, when an embryo tries to develop in their womb, their immune system goes into overdrive to destroy it as if it were an intruding bug or virus.

Instead, the IV mixture helps by fighting killer cells that destroy a mother's chance of pregnancy.

And thanks to the unusual treatment, Ms Garvey and Mr Bowley are now proud parents to baby Joseph who was born on July 8, weighing 7lbs 14oz.

Their son's arrival means they can now begin saving for their wedding.

'It was worth every penny because we got Joseph in the end,' said Ms Garvey, 43, a recruitment administrator.

'We did have to put off our wedding because we couldn't afford it after spending so much money on fertility treatment.

'But Joseph is perfect. He'll be the guest of honour at our wedding.'

The intralipid treatment, as it is known,  enabled Ms Garvey to conceive baby Joseph, born in July this year 

Ms Garvey had expected to have problems conceiving after previously being told she had blocked fallopian tubes.

But with no success after two years of trying, she and Mr Bowley, a retail manager, received two courses of IVF on the NHS, both of which failed. 

Further heartbreak followed after Ms Garvey conceived after the third cycle - but went on to miscarry at five weeks.   

Desperate to become parents, the couple visited a fertility clinic in January last year. 

Called intravenous intralipid therapy, it is made from soya bean oil, egg yolk, glycerin and water and administered through an IV drip.

It works on the premise that some women are actually immune to pregnancy.

So, when an embryo tries to develop in their womb, their immune system goes into overdrive to destroy it as if it were an intruding bug or virus.

Instead, the IV mixture helps by fighting natural killer cells that destroy a mother's chance of pregnancy.  

The IV mixture is highly calorific — about 200 calories a dose, the equivalent of a Snickers bar — and has been likened to 'getting an armful of mayonnaise'

Administered via a drip usually twice before conception, and then three more times after, the treatment is thought to help the embryo implant and grow normally.

Alongside this, women are also recommended to take steroids, which further suppress the immune system, and blood thinners to prevent blood clots, which also can impede embryos implanting.

There, medical experts discovered Ms Garvey had natural killer cells, which were attacking any embryos placed inside her.

'The cells were rejecting the embryos every time we tried IVF,' she said. 

'It was heartbreaking for us when we couldn't get pregnant.. We really wanted a baby and that's why we went through extremes of having IVF.'

Finally in November last year, they started the process again at the CARE fertility centre. 

But this time, doctors decided to combat the natural killer cells by giving Ms Garvey two intralipid infusions of egg yolk and soya oil.

The therapy stimulates the immune system to suppress so-called 'natural killer cells' and allow an embryo to implant in the womb.

One was administered when the fertilised embryos were put back inside her, another when she had a positive pregnancy test.

She said: 'This was the last time we were going to have IVF and I just had a very positive feeling about it from the beginning. 

'We kept our fingers crossed and two weeks later we had a positive test.

'When we went for the early scan to check everything was OK, we were petrified -  but also over the moon. 

'We saw the picture and Dan asked what the flashing was on the screen, and we were told it was the heart beat.

'We both just burst into tears. We hadn't even got that far with the other pregnancy.

'While I was pregnant with Joseph I never moaned about anything. 

And it was amazing when I felt him kicking inside me. Having a baby was our priority. We've now started saving for our wedding.'
