A personal trainer to the stars says you don't need to match the salaries of celebrities in order to emulate their athletic physiques.

Instead, Jon Denoris - whose clients include singers Rachel Stevens and Natasha Bedingfield and The Hills star Whitney Port - said all you need to stay in shape is some basic equipment like dumbbells... and his new book.

And if you can't afford the dumbbells he recommends working with what you have instead, whether that's a water bottle, brief case or handbag.

Solutions for all: Jon says anyone can get fit without expensive equipment - even a water bottle could be used as a weight. The svelte Rachel Stevens, right, is one of his celebrity clients

London based Jon, 39, has written 'The 
Pop-Up Gym', published by Bloomsbury next week, in which he reveals the 
fitness secrets he shares with the stars.

He explained to MailOnline that it's not about spending money but changing lifestyle habits and getting active - no matter where you are. As such, his workouts can be done at home, in the local park or even at work or while on holiday.

He said: 'Working with people in the entertainment 
and business worlds, I have had to find fitness solutions for them that 
are creative and spontaneous, for example at the recording studio, on 
set or in hotel rooms on the road. The book is a natural progression of 
this type of work.'

The park is your oyster: A local bench can be used for step ups, or you can do the moves on your stairs at home

No need for fancy equipment: Jon demonstrates to a client how a tree can be used for pull ups

He added: 'I hope that it breaks down some of 
the barriers to fitness and demonstrates just how easy it can be to 
enjoy fitness and have fun. It's aimed at anyone who wants to become 
more active, particularly those who are time pressured and who don't 
always have fancy equipment close by.'

Jon has devised a number of routines aimed at raising the heart rate and strength and conditioning.

Moves include lunges, squats and press ups and high intensity interval work.

While this type of workout is nothing new, Jon said it is often overlooked as people look for complicated challenges over simplicity - when the latter can provide just as good, or better, results.

Mobile workouts: Jon said the aim of the book is to help people keep fit wherever they are

He said: 'Most experts try to make fitness sound 
complicated, I wanted to create something that was so simple that it 
would be usable. 
I've always felt that simplicity is an art form, fitness unplugged if 
you like.'

As a result, Jon is all for using what you have around you to help you achieve your fitness goals, rather than splashing out on expensive gym membership and equipment.

For example, if you can't afford to buy dumbbells or an Olympic bar, he suggests lifting a heavy bag or brief case instead or do pull ups using a tree branch. Your local park bench is a useful tool for step ups and press ups while the stairs at home can also be used to keep fit.

He said: 'Everyone is an individual. I want people to work 
as hard as they can safely, while having fun. I want them to create 
habits that encourage consistency - this is where so many people fall 
short in their fitness routines, you have to be in it for life.'

This is why Jon says it's important for people to find out which location works for them.

For some of his celebrity clients, like blogger Perez Hilton, this means exercising in his hotel room when travelling for work.

Perez said: 'Despite my poor diet while I was in town 
and drinking like a Londoner, I still managed to lose weight and improve
 my fitness during my recent trip. And I have Jon to thank for that.'

Busy London Mayor Boris Johnson is another of Jon's clients and he advised him to do daily stretches and moves that were possible to do in his office incorporating his furniture like his desk and chair.

Even though Jon owns a fitness studio of his own, Club 51, in London, he believes exercising in a non-gym environment is the future.

He said: 'Gyms need to spend more time working on behavioral change and helping people plan lifestyle fitness solutions, they are too easily led down the fad route and often don't offer value, this is why the budget gyms are booming.

'Thanks to advances in wearable technology and remote-based coaching, people can now get levels of support and help that the traditional gym will be unable to match.'

Along with the exercise routines, Jon explains how to get your mind in gear for a long-­term commitment to fitness. He also shares motivational tips, fat‐burning advice and nutritional information.

The Pop‐up Gym by Jon Denoris is published by Bloomsbury Sport on 8th May, paperback £12.99
