Nasa has spotted the ghostly glow of ancient galaxies that were ripped apart by gravity.

The event happened four billion light-years away inside an immense collection of 500 other galaxies.

And the remarkable data suggests as many as six such structures were torn up over a period of six billion years.

Scientists at Nasa in California have spotted evidence of galaxy destruction in massive galaxy cluster Abell 2744, seen here. Total starlight from the cluster has been coloured blue, with the dispersed light shown in dark blue. The light comes from 'dead' galaxies town apart at the centre of this cluster

The finding was made by Nasa's Hubble Space Telescope in the Abell 2744 galaxy cluster, nicknamed Pandora's Cluster.

It found that scattered stars from the event were no longer bound to any one galaxy, and drift freely between galaxies in the cluster.

By observing the light from the orphaned stars, Hubble astronomers assembled forensic evidence that suggests as many as six galaxies were torn to pieces inside the cluster.

The doomed galaxies would have been pulled apart like 'taffy' according to Nasa if they plunged through the centre of the galaxy cluster where gravitational tidal forces are strongest.

Hubble spotted light that came from 'dead' galaxies.

The galaxies were torn apart long ago by the cluster's gravitational forces, and their stars were scattered into 'intracluster' space - the space between the galaxies.

These orphaned stars roam the cluster, without being gravitationally tethered to any single galaxy.

Because these extremely faint stars are brightest at near-infrared wavelengths of light, this type of observation could only be accomplished with Hubble's infrared sensitivity to extraordinarily dim light

The intracluster light was detected as part of the Frontier Fields program, an ambitious three-year effort, begun in 2013, that teams Hubble with NASA's other Great Observatories - the Spitzer Space Telescope and the Chandra X-ray Observatory - to probe the early universe by studying large galaxy clusters.

Astronomers have long hypothesised that the light from scattered stars should be detectable after such galaxies are disassembled.

However, the predicted glow of stars inside such a cluster was very faint and was therefore a challenge to identify.

'The Hubble data revealing the ghost light are important steps forward in understanding the evolution of galaxy clusters,' said Dr Ignacio Trujillo of The Instituto de Astrofísica de Canarias (IAC), Santa Cruz de Tenerife, Spain.

'It is also amazingly beautiful in that we found the telltale glow by utilizing Hubble's unique capabilities.' 

The team estimates that the combined light of about 200 billion outcast stars contributes approximately 10 per cent of the cluster's brightness.

'The results are in good agreement with what has been predicted to happen inside massive galaxy clusters,' said Dr Mireia Montes of the IAC, lead author of the paper published the Astrophysical Journal.

Hubble measurements determined that the phantom stars are rich in heavier elements like oxygen, carbon, and nitrogen.

This means the scattered stars must be second or third-generation stars enriched with the elements forged in the hearts of the universe's first-generation stars.

Weighing more than four trillion solar masses, Abell 2744 is a target in the Frontier Fields program.

This ambitious three-year effort teams Hubble and Nasa's other Great Observatories to look at select massive galaxy clusters to help astronomers probe the remote universe.

Earlier this month Abell 2744 was used to spotted one of the faintest and most distant galaxies ever seen in the universe. 

Galaxy clusters like this one are so massive that their gravity deflects light passing through them, magnifying, brightening, and distorting light in a phenomenon called gravitational lensing.

Astronomers exploit this property of space to use the clusters as a zoom lens to magnify the images of far-more-distant galaxies that otherwise would be too faint to be seen.

Using the Hubble Space Telescope they saw the glow of orphaned stars

These were once inside galaxies but the structures were ripped apart like 'taffy' by a galaxy cluster over six billion years

As many as six galaxies may have been torn apart at the heart of the cluster

Here gravity is strong enough to cause these dramatic effects
