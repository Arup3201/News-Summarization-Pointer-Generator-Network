Bar mitzvah boy is back and this time he's taking New York Fashion Week by storm.

Sam Horowitz graced the computer screens across Americans as video of his unbelievable bar mitzvah dance routine became a certified viral sensation last month.

Now that he's conquered the hearts of millions with his impressive song and dance moves, he's landed at the biggest style event of the year to prove he's also a true fashionista.

Fashionista: Sam Horowitz, aka bar mitzvah boy, is at New York City Fashion Week proving he's not just about song and dance but also about style and substance

'He loves fashion,' says his mom Angela Horowitz. 'He’s got friends at Neiman Marcus.'

Sam was spotted in a stylish animal print blazer and black leather pants at Helmut Lang's showing of his spring 2014 collection.

He struck a confident pose despite being surrounded by big names like Stacy Kiebler and Taylor Momsen.

The boy whose incredible choreographed
bar mitzvah dance became an internet sensation has now stormed New 
York for a second time. He gave a dazzling Broadway performance of the 
dance routine that made him famous on Good Morning America in August.

Thirteen-year-old
Horowitz grinned as he performed with backup dancers - while his mother revealed he planned his glitzy stage 
entrance when he was just nine.

'At
a very young age, I took him to his first concert,' Angela explained. 
'Dancers came from the ceiling on chandeliers and he said, 
"Mom, I'm gonna do that for my bar mitzvah."

'I thought he would change in four years, but when Sam commits, he commits.'

The
teenager, from Dallas, Texas, took the internet by storm when the 
video, which was filmed last November, appeared on a Jewish parenting 
site. It now ranks as the most popular video on YouTube.

All the stops: Back up dancers, smoke, spot lights, and his name spelled in giant letters--everything about the show was big and it turned out to be a big hit

Crowd pleaser: The audience went wild as the man of the hour was introduced. All of America has since gone just as crazy for the young showman

Wow: Sam appeared to drop from the ceiling in a chandelier-like cylinder before exploding onto the stage

On Broadway: Sam Horowitz, whose bar mitzvah dance became an internet hit, danced on GMA on Thursday

Passionate: The teenager, from Dallas, Texas, said his new found fame felt 'like a dream'

The video shows backup dancers, a stage with his name in giant letters and an enormous round box that drops from the ceiling to 
give the impression that Horowitz was lowered onto the stage.

'I would rehearse every Sunday for a month for three hours with my very good choreographer,' he told GMA, adding that his new-found fame is 'like a dream'.

'I never thought this would happen in my entire life,' he said.

The performance took place at the Omni Hotel in Dallas, and footage of the routine was posted on Youtube on November 26, 2012.

Supportive: Angela Horowitz said her son had been inspired by a music concert four years ago

Excited: Sam said he had practiced for three hours every Sunday for a month before his bar mitzvah performance

It was then posted to the Jewish parenting website Raising Kvell and has since gone viral.

Reactions
to the performance on the Internet were mixed - some people called the 
routine fabulous, others found it 'vulgar' and some people even went so 
far as to attack the boy's sexuality. 

'What is this? "Keeping up with the Steins"? Sorry, I find it vulgar, 
ostentatious, and humiliating,' commented Gary Goldstein, a physician from Oro Valley.

'Was this for the benefit of the parents 
or the kid? All that was missing was a stripper pole.'

Another person commented that, 'Sam is going to make some man very happy one day,' while another added that 'this little boy has to be gay because there would be no other reason to 
have something over the top for him. He's turning 13 years old he's not a
burlesque dancer.'

This isn't Horowitz's first performance, though - prior to his bar mitzvah dance routine, Horowitz filmed his own music video for the Carly Rae Jepsen hit 'Call Me Maybe.'

The footage shows him lounging around an opulent home and dancing in swimming pools  with friends as they mouth the words to the popular song.
