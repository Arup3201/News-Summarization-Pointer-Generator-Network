After Saturday's comprehensive Premier League win against Swansea on Saturday the Chelsea players have every right to be in confident mood.

And Diego Costa, Willian and Filipe Luis looked relaxed as the squad took a flight to Liverpool on Monday ahead of their Capital One Cup semi-final against Liverpool at Anfield.

The trio were all smiles as they posed for a picture on board the jet, which Brazilian Willian shared on Instagram with the caption: 'Off to Liverpool'.

Chelsea go into Tuesday's clash off the back of the 5-0 thrashing of Swansea at the Liberty Stadium - a win that put Jose Mourinho's side firmly back in charge of the title race after Manchester City's defeat by Arsenal maintained a five-point lead.

Captain John Terry, who was a relative bystander during Saturday's easy win, insists that league form will go out the window against Liverpool.

'It (Anfield) is going to be a tough place to go. I think Daniel Sturridge might be back, (Raheem) Sterling is back as well and they proved when we went up there in the league that it's always a tough game.

'You kind of forget form and where they are, it goes out of the window, it's Chelsea vs Liverpool. It's going to be tough and over the two legs I just hope we're strong enough.'

The former England international is no stranger to winning trophies at Chelsea, but admits this Jose Mourinho side cannot be considered great until it brings silverware to Stamford Bridge. 

'We've got top, top players but, as I've said before, until we go and win things, it's not there yet,' Terry said.

World Cup-winner Andre Schurrle scored the fifth and final goal of the afternoon with just 10 minutes remaining

'That will be the test. We've shown during the first half of the season that we're capable of pushing the top sides and that's what we aim to do.

'There is a motivation in the dressing room to win the league and push on in the Capital One Cup, Champions League and FA Cup. At this stage, to still be involved in all competitions is where you want to be, and it's down to big players to step up.'

'In the first half at Swansea, the football and the goals were some of the best I've seen. Myself and Gaz (Gary Cahill) felt like we weren't doing much apart from applauding what we were seeing in front of us, it was a delight to watch and I really hope we continue that.'
