Very few saw the funny side when West Brom’s Saido Berahino was filmed inhaling laughing gas last season.

But the England hopeful was back to putting smiles on faces with two goals on the opening day of the season.

His breakthrough campaign had included a hat-trick on his full debut and an England Under 21 call, only to end with the ‘hippy crack’ controversy and team-mates blaming him for the surrender of a last-minute lead against relegation rivals Cardiff.

Back with a bang: Saido Berahino scored twice as West Brom drew 2-2 with Sunderland on the opening day

Spot on: Berahino strokes home a penalty just before half-time for the first of his two goals 

Sunderland have not won on the opening day since Darren Bent scored the only goal at Bolton in 2009. 

West Brom, however, survived, and so did Berahino. And on Saturday he delivered a reminder as to the talent which sees him touted as a future full international.

The 21-year-old converted a first-half penalty – cancelling out Lee Cattermole’s early stunner - and volleyed a second after the break before Seb Larsson salvaged a late draw for the visitors.

But Berahino – pacey, problematic and potent - had been the game’s best player and insists last season’s travails served an invaluable lesson.

‘I have learned a lot,’ he said when asked about inhaling the legal high and the dressing-room bust following Cardiff.

‘It’s made me a better player and a better person off the field. I am more aware of stuff that goes on in and around football, so it’s made me a much better and stronger person.

‘(Cardiff) is in the past and everyone has moved on. We drew a line under it straight after the game and we’re all just looking forward to this season.’

New Baggies boss Alan Irvine has had no issues with Berahino – who fled war-torn Burundi aged 10 after his father was killed – and expects him to remain at The Hawthorns this season.

‘I have not had to talk to him about his discipline. I was aware of (his problems) as they were well documented,’ said the Scot, who swapped Everton’s academy for the Premier League dugout in June.

‘Saido has been a model professional. What happens in the past, people make some bad decisions at different times, we have all done it.

‘But he is a pleasure to work with. I hope he doesn’t feel the need to pursue a career beyond here. He could be a top player. He has got so much talent.’

The respect is mutual, as Berahino added: ‘Outsiders might see him (Irvine) as a surprise choice but he’s a really good coach and from the first day he came in he’s had us all working together as a unit and he’s got everyone back to happiness.

‘So we are all just working together great and we’re lucky to have him because he’s a good man and a good coach.’

Sunderland, meanwhile, had new dad Larsson to thank for rescuing a deserved point five minutes from time. The 29-year-old Swede – whose wife gave birth a baby girl last week – climaxed a swift breakaway from close range after debutants Jordi Gomez and Patrick van Aanholt had combined.

The Black Cats won four of their final five games to escape the drop last season but Larsson feels there is renewed optimism under Gus Poyet.

England hopes: Jack Rodwell, who made his debut for Sunderland, is hoping for an international recall

‘I’m pretty confident that we’re not going to be in trouble this season,’ he said. ‘I’ve really been looking forward to this season – more than for any other in a long time. I just feel that we’re going places.’

Poyet handed a debut to £10million Jack Rodwell – who hopes to win an England recall this month – but he was subdued and was replaced midway through the second half.

On this evidence, it is Berahino who you’d back for a place in Roy Hodgson’s Three Lions squad.
