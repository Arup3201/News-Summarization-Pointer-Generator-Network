Standing at only 5ft 2in tall and using a customised gun with pink cartridges, 16-year-old Amber Hill admits she is ‘not your typical shooter’.

She was taught to shoot by her grandfather when she was nine years old and is a rising star in the sport.

And yesterday she made her Commonwealth Games debut at Glasgow 2014, missing out on a place in the women’s skeet semi-final, in which competitors fire at clay discs, after a tense shoot-off.

The BBC Young Sports Personality of the Year now has her sights set on the Rio 2016 Olympics.

She bowed out of the Games gracefully, tweeting: ‘Thanks for all the support everyone! Missed out on a place in the final in the shoot-off but been a great experience.’

She recently spoke about competing in a male-dominated sport, saying: ‘My nails are bright, I have a sprayed gun and pink cartridges. I’m not a typical shooter. 

‘I am still really girly, but sport is a big part of my life. I don’t see why I can’t have a mix of both, even though it is a male-dominated sport.’

The Berkshire schoolgirl burst on to the shooting scene in 2012 when she equalled the women’s world record.

Last year she became the youngest ever winner of a senior gold medal at a skeet world cup in Mexico.

She said: ‘This is my first Commonwealth Games. I’ve never been to a competition of this scale so I’ve definitely learned a lot.’

Miss Hill joined her grandfather Bill Rogers on a shoot when she was still in primary school.

‘My granddad’s influenced me so much,’ she said. ‘He’s done everything – he comes every week to training, to competitions.’

Mr Rogers told the BBC: ‘I think she can go to the top. She’s just a natural shot. The first time she picked up the gun, I could see she could shoot.’
