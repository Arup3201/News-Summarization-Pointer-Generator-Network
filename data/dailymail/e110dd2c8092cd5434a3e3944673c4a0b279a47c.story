A 35-year-old Florida woman has been arrested over claims that she had been having sex with a 12-year-old boy.

Joy L McCall is facing three counts of lewd and lascivious battery after the schoolboy confided in a friend at church.

McCall, who has children the same age as her alleged victim, is accused of having sex on three occasions with the boy.

Charges: Joy McCall was arrested after her victim's mother discovered text messages she sent to her son

The 12-year-old, who has not been named, told police that he had been receiving Facebook messages from the woman which 'continued to get more heated'.

The boy claimed McCall sent him pictures of her underwear and arranged through text messages to meet him at a shopping mall, according to a police report seen by Ocala News.

On January 13, McCall allegedly picked the boy up at Paddock Mall and they had sex in the backseat of her car.

The boy claimed he contacted her again five days later. She picked the student up and drove him to some woods, where they had sex again.

He claimed they met for a third time on February 16 and had sex in the same wooded area.

McCall, a shop worker, confirmed that she had sex with the boy, according to police.

The person the boy confided in told the 
victim's mother, who called police after finding text messages between 
McCall and her son.

'She was able to see through the different text messaging that had occurred between McCall and the juvenile. And determine the dates that the incidents had occurred,' Sergeant Angy Scroble told WCJB.

McCall, who has no previous convictions for sexual offenses in Marion County, had her first court appearance on Tuesday, where a judge set her bond at $45,000.
