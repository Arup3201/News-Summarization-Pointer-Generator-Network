David Cameron today lashed out at Russia's 'illegal' intervention in Ukraine

David Cameron today accused Russia of sending its tanks across the border into Ukraine in a ‘completely unacceptable and illegal’ invasion.

The Prime Minister threatened ‘further consequences’ if Vladimir Putin failed to pull back his forces.

Mr Cameron’s remarks came as 1,000 Russian troops crossed the border into Ukraine, according to Nato. A further 20,000 Russian troops are stationed just across the border.

The Prime Minister said Mr Putin's claims to desire a peaceful solution to the crisis in Ukraine are ‘not credible’ while tanks roll across the border.

The Prime Minister said he was ‘extremely concerned’ about reports of major troop movements from Russia into south eastern Ukraine and warned the activity must stop immediately.

The crisis in Ukraine will be at the top of the agenda of next week's Nato summit in Wales, where Mr Cameron will meet with other alliance members to discuss collective security at Europe's eastern border.

In a statement, Mr Cameron said: ‘I'm extremely concerned by mounting evidence that Russian troops have made large-scale incursions into South Eastern Ukraine, completely disregarding the sovereignty of a neighbour.

‘The international community has already warned Russia that such provocative actions would be completely unacceptable and illegal.'

He added: ‘President Putin has said that Russia is willing to find a peaceful solution to the conflict but this is not credible when Russia is supporting pro-Russian separatists in Ukraine with arms and troops.

'It is simply not enough to engage in talks in Minsk, while Russian tanks continue to roll over the border into Ukraine. Such activity must cease immediately.

‘We urge Russia to pursue a different path and to find a political solution to this crisis. If Russia does not, then she should be in no doubt that there will be further consequences.’

Earlier, Ukraine's president Petro Poroshenko said: ‘Russian forces have entered Ukraine.’

Mr Poroshenko summoned his national security council as the strategic south-eastern town of Novoazovsk appeared firmly under the control of separatists and their Russian backers.

The moves open a new front in the war in eastern Ukraine between the separatists and his government in Kiev.

Speaking at Nato headquarters, Brigadier General Nico Tak, Dutch commander of Nato's crisis operations centre, said the ultimate aim of Russia was to stave off defeat for the separatists and turn eastern Ukraine into a ‘frozen conflict’ that would destabilise the country ‘indefinitely’.
