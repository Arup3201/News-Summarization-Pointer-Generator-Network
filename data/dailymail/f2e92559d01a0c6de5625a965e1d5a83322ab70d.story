A great grandmother has been banned from visiting a day centre in her own wheelchair after council health and safety bosses said it was made of the 'wrong' kind of metal.

Retired nurse Ryta Grimston, 80, has been enjoying her outings to the centre in Selby, in her aluminium chair for six years without any complaints.

But the pensioner was shocked to be told she has to leave her chair at home because it is not 'crash proof' according to a new 'risk assessment'.

Banned: Ryta Grimston, 80, has been told by North Yorkshire County Council that she can no longer be transported to a day centre in Selby in her aluminium wheelchair, because it is not 'crash proof'. The great grandmother has been told she must use a council approved steel chair instead.

Mrs Grimston pays £2.40 a time to be transported by North Yorkshire County Council from the doorstep of her home in Selby to the day centre three miles away.

Because the chair is not steel, but softer metal, council bosses are concerned about the risks of transporting her there in a wheelchair taxi or minibus.

The authority fears that if there was a crash during the eight-minute journey the chair’s frame might not withstand the impact - and the council could be held liable.

Mrs Grimston said the first she knew of the new rule was when the council taxi service told her: ‘I’m sorry. We can’t take you because your wheelchair is not crash proof.'

Now the council drivers have to pick up a spare steel wheelchair from the day centre, take it to Mrs Grimston's home, and take her to the day centre in it.

But the steel chair is too heavy for 
her to propel herself so she has to be pushed around by the care staff 
when she arrives - or just slump in an arm chair.

She
 does not have the use of her left hand, having suffered a stroke 
affecting her left hand side, and would therefore be unable to move the 
heavier chair without help.

Mrs
 Grimston, of Thorpe Willoughby, Selby, has branded the ban ridiculous, 
particularly since she uses her own chair when her family take her out 
in a car.

She has also been told by some of the
 care workers that they have taken clients out in the same type of 
aluminium chair without problems.

She
 said: 'It is stupid idea. I have been going to the centre all these 
years in the aluminium chair and no one has said anything.

Lifeline: The retired nurse has been visiting the Carentan House day centre (pictured) for six years, with no problems. But North Yorkshire County Council has now said her aluminuim wheelchair is not strong enough to withstand any possible crash, while travelling to and from the centre

'Everyone has been having a good laugh about it. But on the serious side it has really upset me and I can’t sleep.

'It is health and safety gone mad. My son asked me what the punch line was and I said "it is not a joke - it’s true".

Anger: Mrs Grimston branded the council risk assessment 'stupid', adding: 'It's health and safety gone mad'

'I have just paid over £75 for a new seat for my chair - and now they say it is no flipping good.

'There is no way I’m buying a steel one. A steel one would be too heavy and there is a long waiting list anyway.'

Her family say her visits to the Carentan House day centre have been a lifeline in the 80-year-old's twilight years.

She has dinner there with her friends, plays bingo and dominoes, does a spot of baking, and goes for picnics in the local park.

Mrs Grimston added: 'Going to the day
 centre is the only time I can get out. I have had a stroke and can’t 
move far or walk very much.

'Sometimes they take us on to Bridlington on day trips in a mini bus. I suppose I won’t be able to go on those either now.

'The silly thing is if I go in an ambulance to hospital for a check-up I go in my own chair.

'If
 it can go in the back of an ambulance I don’t see why the council can’t
 take me anywhere in it and the carers say they regularly take clients 
out in aluminium chairs.'

A
 council spokeswoman said: 'The county council must ensure that people 
transported in wheelchairs in any of our vehicles are safe.

'Over the last couple of years 
therefore the county council has been carrying out a rolling programme 
of risk assessments to ensure that wheelchairs are suitable to be used 
on transport in line with the manufacturers’ guidelines.

'In
 cases where wheelchairs are found to be not suitable for 
transportation, the county council makes every effort to ensure that 
users are able to access their usual services.

'In this case, the county council has arranged for a suitable wheelchair to be made available on a temporary basis so the customer can be transported in the usual way, until a permanent solution can be found.'

But The Selby and Ainsty Tory MP Nigel Adams said: 'It sounds like box ticking gone mad. I shall be looking into this.

'If Mrs Grimston wants to get in touch with me I will speak to the county council on her behalf.

'But on the face of it seems like one of the local authority more bizarre dictats.

'There is clearly no health safety risk while she is inside the day centre. It is just a transportation issue.'
