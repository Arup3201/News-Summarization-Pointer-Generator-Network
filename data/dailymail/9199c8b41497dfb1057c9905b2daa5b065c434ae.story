Ruling: Sir James Munby dismissed Essex council's application to have the name of the women whose child was taken suppressed by the media

A campaign by social workers to stop an Italian mother speaking out about the way she lost her child was an ‘affront to humanity’, a senior judge said yesterday.

Sir James Munby, the country’s leading family judge, said the attempt to silence the mother was an ‘affront not merely to the law but also, surely, to any remotely acceptable concept of human dignity and, indeed, humanity itself’.

He also said the scandal over Alessandra Pacchieri, who underwent a forced caesarean before her child was taken for adoption, was a ‘final, stark and irrefutable demonstration’ of the need for revolution in openness in the family courts.

Sir James, President of the Family Division, took over the case this month after newspapers, including the Mail, revealed the story.

The pregnant 35-year-old, who suffers from bipolar disorder, was sectioned under the Mental Health Act after suffering a breakdown at Stansted Airport last summer.

In secret court hearings, a Court of Protection judge ordered she undergo a compulsory caesarean, and a family court judge in Chelmsford overruled her pleas and ordered that her baby daughter should be adopted in Britain.

Yesterday Sir James gave reasons for his ruling on an application by Essex County Council, whose social workers are in charge of the care of the child, banning publication of Miss Pacchieri’s name or picture, or that of the father or family, alongside anything that could identify the baby.

The judge said: ‘Given the circumstances of the case and the extreme gravity of the issues which here confronted the courts...  it is hard to imagine a case which more obviously and compellingly requires that public debate be free and unrestricted.’

Ordering that nothing should be published that identified the child, including the mother’s married name, Sir James said the mother should be free to identify herself by her first and maiden names.

‘The mother has an equally obvious and compelling claim to be allowed to tell her story,’ he said. ‘If ever there was a case in which that right should not be curtailed it is surely this case.’

Sir James also disclosed there were five errors in the application for reporting restrictions initially put forward by Essex, including failures to attach documents, state timings, and supply reasons for various submissions.
