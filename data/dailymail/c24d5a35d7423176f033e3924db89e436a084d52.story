Now he is to be a father, you might think Simon Cowell would want to start looking after himself – and his pregnant girlfriend – a little better.

But it seems even the responsibilities of impending parenthood can’t stop the TV mogul from lighting up a cigarette.

The 54-year-old has been spotted smoking in the company of Lauren Silverman in the past weeks, leading to fears his habit could harm his unborn baby.

Habit: Simon Cowell lights up as he leaves St Martin's Theatre, London, with New York socialite Lauren Silverman, who is reportedly carrying his child. He was criticised by the charity Action on Smoking and Health

Pictures of him puffing away by her side even prompted health charity Action on Smoking and Health to warn all pregnant women to avoid passive smoke because of the increased risks of congenital abnormalities.

After studying images of the pair, the charity’s research manager Amanda Sandford said: ‘Tobacco smoke is toxic and can harm the unborn child so it’s really important that pregnant women avoid breathing in tobacco smoke, whether through active or passive smoking.

‘Studies show that babies born to women who were exposed to secondhand smoke during pregnancy are at greater risk of having a low birth weight, congenital abnormalities and are also at increased risk of dying shortly after birth.’

Cowell is a self-confessed nicotine addict, and once admitted he started smoking at the age of eight.

Earlier this year, he tried to kick his 40-a-day menthols habit by switching to smokeless electric cigarettes instead.

But he was soon back on the tobacco, admitting: ‘I equate smoking with having a good time. I shouldn’t be saying this but, well, they’re not illegal, are they? After sex – amazing.’

Last month, Cowell had a cigarette in his hand when he and 36-year-old Miss Silverman – who is five months pregnant – went out to dinner in New York.

And he was smoking again over the weekend as they walked side by side down the street in Beverly Hills on Sunday.

The X Factor boss recently said he felt he would be a good father despite not having a natural affinity with babies.

He said: ‘I’m not brilliant with babies. I never know what to do. But [once it’s older] I think I’ll be a good dad in terms of advice. And then I’ll get to do all the things I want to do, like go to Disneyland or Universal Studios, teach him how to drive – I love all that.’

However, he added he would ‘100% absolutely not’ change the child’s nappies.

Miss Silverman divorced her husband in August after it was revealed she was carrying Cowell’s child.The New York socialite has told friends she wants to marry him.
