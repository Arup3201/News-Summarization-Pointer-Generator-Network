The President and First Lady both filmed TV appearances in Burbank, California on Thursday - but billed taxpayers for two separate private flights to get there.

Barack Obama took Air Force One to LAX, at a cost of more than $1million, so he could be on Jimmy Kimmel Live.

But, rather than ride with him, Michelle Obama chartered a different, earlier plane for a slot on The Ellen DeGeneres Show, filmed in the same LA suburb as Kimmel's program.

Tough at the top: Barack Obama took some time to read insulting tweets about himself on the show

Despite the closeness, the White House has insisted that the pair's schedules 'were not in sync', CNN reported.

The Commander-in-Chief used his time on the airwaves to read out mean tweets about himself, while Mrs Obama busted dance moves alongside DeGeneres to the tune of Uptown Funk.

Obama's episode of Kimmel has aired already, while the full DeGeneres show is due on Monday.

White House deputy press secretary Eric Schultz defended the arrangement to a group of reporters on Air Force One.

He said: 'I believe on this occasion the schedules were not in sync to travel together... I'm not even sure they overlapped.'

Obama's visit was also occasion for a host of obvious - and expensive - security measures. When the president took a helicopter from LAX to Burbank airport, he was accompanied by three military choppers.

A team of snipers was also dispatched to Los Angles to guard the president, who took a 40-car motorcade from Burbank's airport to Kimmel's studio.

The Obamas are not thought to have seen one other at all in California. The president flew on to Phoenix on Friday afternoon, while the First Lady returned to the White House Thursday.

Air Force One costs more than $200,000 an hour to fly, meaning the tab for Obama's flight to Los Angeles will have passed the $1million mark by itself.

The specifics of the First Lady's travel arrangements are not clear, though it is likely to have stacked tens of thousands of dollars on to the overall cost.

It is not the first time the First Family has come under scrutiny for drafting multiple planes for very similar trips.

A 2011 summer jaunt to Martha's Vineyard saw the President take Air Force One solo to the famous golfing spot.

Michelle, Sasha and Malia followed in a separate jet just four hours later - likely costing tens of thousands extra again.

The Obama family went to even greater lengths to fly apart earlier that year.

The annual presidential retreat to Hawaii saw Michelle and the children set off several days before the president, taking an 'office in the sky' jet designed for military commanders, at an estimated cost of at $63,000.
