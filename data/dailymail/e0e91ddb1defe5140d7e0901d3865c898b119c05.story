Controversy: A tweet by Evan Davis provoked a quick response from the Latvian Institute

When BBC broadcaster Evan Davis bumped into a ‘lovely guy’ at a barbecue, he decidedto help him out.

He called on his 125,000 Twitter followers to find the migrant worker a job so he would not have to return home to Latvia.

What he did not expect was for his good deed to land him in hot water with the Latvian authorities – who accused him of comparing their country to the evil realm of Mordor in Lord of the Rings.

The Dragons’ Den and Today programme host met unemployed Constantin Jenson, 35, ata friend’s house last weekend.

The aspiring actor had been living in London for two-and-a-half months and was struggling to find a job.

Davis, 51, posted a picture of him on Twitter with the words: ‘Can anyone give this lovely guy I met at a bbq yesterday a job? Hospitality perhaps? Or he has to return to Latvia.’

However, the Latvian Institute, a body set up by Latvia’s government to promote ‘positive awareness’ of the country abroad, did not approve of his suggestion that returning home to the Baltic state would be an ordeal.

It said: ‘Latvia is not Mordor. Economy is on the rise for the 12th consecutive quarter, and unemployment is down and the country is gorgeous’.

Helping hand: Evan Davis' tweet, pictured, was meant as an act of kindness but was seen as casting aspersions on an entire nation by Latvian authorities

Despite Davis’s helping hand, Mr Jenson was unsuccessful in his job hunt and is expected to return to Latvia today, having run out of savings.

He insisted his stay in the UK had been a ‘fun experience’ and thanked the presenter for trying to help him.

The Latvian Institute's public relations officer Karlis Pots told MailOnline: 'It was all 
meant in good fun. We thought the final part of his tweet "or he has to 
return to Lativa" sounded a bit dramatic... It was a bit like "or else".

'We wanted to portray that everything is not perfect but is improving economically wise.

On the up: Latvian authorities were keen to point out the country, of which Riga, pictured, is the capital, were booming

Not Latvia: The country's authorities insisted Latvia was not Mordor, pictured, but instead a thriving, vibrant economy

Setting the record straight: The Latvian Institute was quick to react to Evan Davis' tweet, with a tweet of their own, stating that the country was actually booming

'We
are not annoyed with Mr Davis, it's not at all that. We just wanted to 
let him know maybe he should choose his phrasing a little better. It 
sounds a bit overly dramatic.

'We've
been an EU country now for more than nine years and, as I wrote in the 
tweet, our economy has been up for 12 consecutive quarters, our economy 
is the fastest growing economy in the EU.

'I'm not saying everything is 
fine and dandy, there is work to be done, but if there is a chance to 
combat misconceptions about the country, then we'll take it.'

A BBC spokesman said: ‘As Evan is tweeting from a personal account we would not comment on this.’
