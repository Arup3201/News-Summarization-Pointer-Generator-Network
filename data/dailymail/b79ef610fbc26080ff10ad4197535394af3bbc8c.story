Last night's highly publicised television debate between the Prime Minister and the leader of the opposition was intended to focus the watching audience's attention acutely on them ahead of the general election in May. 

However, the morning after the night before, another name is grabbing the headlines.

As Jeremy Paxman's co-host on Cameron & Miliband Live: The Battle for Number 10, Sky News anchor Kay Burley, 54, was charged with managing the audience's questions.

Kay Burley, pictured with David Cameron and Jeremy Paxman, was accused of giving the PM an easy ride 

Narrowing her gaze at Mr Miliband: The Sky News anchor was trending on Twitter after the programme aired with one user, Imperial Aerosol Kid accusing her of being 'biased' towards Cameron

Perched to left of the stage, wearing a bright pink dress, the presenter caused such a storm while interviewing David Cameron and Ed Miliband, that her name promptly trended on Twitter.

Imperial Aerosol Kid wrote: 'I'm not sure how any sensible person can say Kay Burley was neutral last night. I laughed a few times at how biased she was.'

While Tommy Ball wrote sarcastically: 'Just watched Kay Burley. Really hard to see where her political loyalties lie. Wonderfully even-handed.'

The audience at home also derided the co-host, accusing her of giving the Prime Minister an easy ride, as she asked him questions about Shredded Wheat (in reference to leading for three terms) and even his favourite colour.

A spokesman for communications watchdog Ofcom said it had received 131 complaints by late morning today, all of which were about perceived bias against the Labour leader. 

An Ofcom spokesman said: 'We are assessing the complaints before deciding whether or not to investigate.' 

Channel 4 also confirmed today that they had received around 300 complaints following the show last night although a spokeswoman couldn't confirm specifically what they were about.

Viewers at home took to Twitter to say they felt Burley, 54, was noticeably softer on the PM

Kay has responded to many of the Twitter responses...surmising that both herself and Jeremy Paxman were 'alternately accused of being pro and anti both Cameron and Miliband'

The news anchor took to Twitter herself to refute accusations of bias.

She posted after the debate: 'I see JP [Jeremy Paxman] and I are being alternately accused of being pro and anti both Cameron and Miliband. Our work here is done #BattleForNumber10.' 

Later, when another user accused her of 'telling porkies' about the reaction of viewers on Twitter, Burley responded that '@Ed_Miliband team disagreed', suggesting the Labour party team were happy with Burley's questioning of Mr Miliband.

A Channel 4 spokeswoman said both parties had been happy with the format: 'Both politicians, one of whom is likely to be the next Prime Minister, agreed to the format and were prepared for and actively participated in robust questioning about their policies and abilities. Neither party has expressed any dissatisfaction to Channel 4.'  

Burley, 54, responded on Twitter that the Miliband team were 'happy' with her performance

Making Peter cry: Pop star and television presenter was reduced to tears in 2010 after Burley asked him about whether he worried about losing custody of his children. The star promptly asked for the interview to end

There was an awkward moment during Miliband's questions with the audience when Burley seemed to introduce an audience member as former One Direction boy band member Zayn Malik. The man's name was actually Zaid Malik.

Twitter users also didn't miss the opportunity to rake over Burley's previous TV clangers.

The Wigan-born Sky News anchor has, on more than a few occasions, prompted a backlash with her questioning.

In October 2012, when Burley was dispatched to Machynlleth in Wales to report on the disappearance of five-year-old April Jones, she told volunteers searching for the little girl that the case had become a murder inquiry live on TV. The volunteers broke down at the news.

At the time, Labour MP Tom Watson accused Burley of being 'insensitive bordering on cruel'.

Complaints were filed against Sky News in 2010 after Burley broke the news to two female volunteers live on camera that the disappearance of five-year-old April Jones was being treated as a murder enquiry  

The women were unaware of the latest developments in the April Jones case and were visibly distressed as the cameras continued to roll. Critics accused Burley of 'unethical journalism'

In 2010, Burley commented that US Vice President Joe Biden's head looked bruised. 'What's happened to his head?' she asked. 'It looks like he's walked into a door.' Biden was actually daubed in Ash Wednesday ash.

In the same year, she reduced pop star and TV presenter Peter Andre to tears during a live interview after asking him whether he worried about losing custody of his children. Andre, who was on the show to promote his new tour was left upset and asked for the interview to end. 

However, perhaps her most famous gaffe remains her 2001 declaration that 'the entire eastern seaboard of the United States has been decimated by a terrorist attack' as she covered the unfolding 9/11 tragedy. It is a moment that her critics haven't let her forget.
