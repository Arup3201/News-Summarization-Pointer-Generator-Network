Two thirds of voters want George Osborne to increase the amount people earn before paying tax, instead of a tax cut for middle and high earners, a new poll shows.

Only 13 per cent of people think the Chancellor should use tomorrow’s Budget to increase the point at which workers start paying the 40p higher rate of tax.

It will bolster Mr Osborne’s determination to face down calls from Tory MPs to take action to help the 1.3million extra people dragged into the 40p band.

Two thirds of people back a rise in the income tax threshold over increase in the 40p rate

Chancellor George Osborne is expected to use tomorrow's Budget to increase the income tax threshold to £10,500

The coalition parties have become bitterly divided over how to use extra cash in the Treasury coffers to cut income tax.

The Lib Dems have pushed for an increase in the amount workers can earn before paying any income tax.

In April it will hit £10,000 – up from £6,475 in 2010 – but Mr Osborne is expected to go further and increase it to £10,500.

It will mean basic rate taxpayers will pay £800 less income tax in 2015 than in 2010.

However, Mr Osborne has faced a storm of criticism from some Conservatives for freezing and lowering the higher rate of tax.

In 2010 when the coalition was formed there were 3.02million people earning more than the £43,875 threshold where they started paying the higher tax rate.

But this year the threshold has fallen to £41,450, which means 4.4million now pay the 40p rate.  In 1988 just 1.35million was paying that rate.

According to a YouGov poll for the Sun, 66 per cent of people want Mr Osborne to use any money available for income tax cuts to increase the personal allowance.

Only 13 per cent favour an increase in the 40p tax threshold, 10 per cent want neither change and 11 per cent don’t know.

In a further boost for Mr Osborne, 33 per cent of people now think he is doing a ¿good job¿ as Chancellor, up from 26 per cent in December

Mr Osborne has extended his lead of Ed Balls for being the best Chancellor to 13 points, the YouGov survey for The Sun found

There has been clamour from Conservative backbenchers, backed by former chancellors Lord Lawson and Lord Lamont, for Mr Osborne to announce a significant hike in the threshold to ensure the higher rate is once again reserved for the biggest earners.

But Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg insisted even those paying the 40p rate are better off as a result of increases to the tax threshold to £10,000.

He told Sky News: "There's a huge misconception about this. Yes, it is true that more people are paying the 40p rate of income tax, but no, they are not paying more income tax.

Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg insisted even those paying the 40p rate of tax were better off

‘It might sound counter-intuitive, but because we've raised the point at which you start paying income tax, finally reaching my long-cherished aim of removing income tax paid on the first £10,000 you earn as of next month, you are also better off as a 40 per cent income tax payer.

‘Far from paying any extra income tax as a 40 per cent income tax payer, you are on average about £300 better off.

‘In other words, you pay £300 less income tax than you might have done at the beginning of this Parliament.’

Asked if there would be any change in the 40p rate tomorrow, Mr Clegg

 In a further boost for Mr Osborne, 33 per cent of people now think he is doing a ‘good job’ as Chancellor, up from 26 per cent in December.

Some 39 per cent think he is doing a bad job, down from 46 per cent at the end of 2013.

The Tory Chancellor has also extended his lead over Labour rival Ed Balls.

In the latest YouGov poll 35 per cent said Mr Osborne would make the better Chancellor, compared to 22 per cent who said Mr Balls – a 13 point lead.

In January last year, only 32 per cent said Mr Osborne, to Mr Balls’ 23 per cent, a 9 point lead.
