She's the face and body of Victoria's Secret but Lily Aldridge, 29, is no slouch when it comes to high fashion as this stunning new shoot reveals.

The American model has appeared in a shoot for Spanish magazine S Moda, and wears a striking blue faux fur coat that's a far cry from the glittery bras produced by the lingerie behemoth.

Her make-up also appears to have undergone a dramatic transformation, with Ms Aldridge channeling a striking Jane Birkin style look - complete with 70s eyeliner and nude lips.

Hairstylist to the stars, Keith Carpenter  cut the Victoria's Secret Angel's hair for the magazine's November cover, transforming her single-length long locks into a choppy 'shag'.

As a result, Aldridge looks every inch the 1970s style icon in the photos, which were shot by David Roemer and styled by fashion director Chabela Garcia.

The model, who has one child with Kings of Leon frontman Caleb Followill, is known for having one of the hottest bodies in the business, but these latest pictures show she doesn't have to take her clothes off to prove it.

First spotted by a scout at a school carnival, the model's career has since gone from strength-to-strength, although her super-stylish family has certainly come in handy.

Her father is an illustrator who designed The Rolling Stones’ album artwork, while her half-brother Miles is a world renowned fashion photographer.

Half-sister Saffron is also a model, having spent years working for Ralph Lauren, and younger sister Ruby is a model and singer.

'I grew up on fashion shoots,' she said recently. 'When I was a kid, I thought I was going to be a soccer player, then a photographer, as I looked up to Miles so much.'

'But I was so in awe of Saffron; I watched her work all the time.'
