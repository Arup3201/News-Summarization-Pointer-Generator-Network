The cover photo for Manchester United’s first match programme of the new Gaal-actico era tried to capture the mood with one simple image: a picture of Angel di Maria’s No 7 shirt hanging in the Old Trafford dressing-room alongside that of Radamel Falcao’s No 9. Two superstars who alone could end up costing in excess of £110million.

On the next peg you could only just about make out Marcos Rojo’s jersey. And if you didn’t know the identity of the other new signing making his home debut yesterday, it was practically impossible to read the blurred name and number on the back of the fourth shirt.

When Daley Blind was unveiled next to Falcao at a press conference last Thursday afternoon, he might as well not have been there. A couple of polite questions were put to the baby-faced Dutchman with the mop of blond hair, but the spotlight was inevitably fixed on the Colombia striker.

There was little change yesterday. Di Maria deservedly stole the show with his match-winning contribution, and the biggest ovation of the day was reserved for Falcao’s introduction in the second half.

Blind, meanwhile, eased seamlessly and selflessly into his new surroundings at the other end of the pitch.

Patrolling the area in front of United’s experimental defence, he sniffed out and then snuffed out any trouble he could detect on the rare occasions QPR threatened. It was if he had been there for years.

This is a job he perfected at Ajax and is the reason Van Gaal paid £14million to take the son of his old captain and right-hand man Danny Blind with him to Old Trafford.

To Van Gaal, Blind is the epitome of an Ajax player: an intelligent, disciplined, and tactically astute player capable of operating in a number of different positions and following his coach’s instructions to the letter. They don’t make you Dutch Player of the Year — an award Blind accepted at the start of this month — for any old reason.

‘I have worked with Daley in the Netherlands national squad, so he is no stranger to me,’ wrote Van Gaal in his programme notes yesterday. ‘He is a very intelligent player and a great reader of the game. He has the versatility to play in many positions which is a great asset to have and gives me many options for him.’

Van Gaal played Blind primarily as a left-back for Holland at the World Cup, and it was the 24-year-old’s arrowing through ball that picked out Robin van Persie for his spectacular diving header against Spain. He also weighed in with a goal in the third-place play-off against hosts Brazil.

Going forward there will be tougher tests for Daley Blind and his teammates, but it was a good start

But Blind prefers the midfield holding role and that is where the manager hopes to utilise him most at United — a defensive anchor to the fearsome offensive line-up he has assembled at Old Trafford.

That is not to say that Blind will not have licence to get forward. It was his 25-yard effort yesterday that led to the parry from Rob Green and loose ball that Falcao could — and perhaps should — have turned into his first goal for United.

But not every game will be a comfortable four-goal canter against weak opposition, and Blind knows that his job going forward will be to screen his defence, break up play and get the ball rolling for United’s high-octane attack.

He is a lot more than ‘a water carrier’, as Eric Cantona once dismissively described Didier Deschamps. Observers in Holland talk about his almost metronomic passing and an ability to set the tempo of a game. It was hard to remember him misplacing a pass yesterday.

Afterwards Blind could not have been more satisfied with his debut. ‘I was really excited before the game,’ he said. ‘It was a really good debut and everything has gone well. I felt at home straight away.

‘It is a new team and it can be difficult at first but I think we did well. Everybody is feeling good and everyone helped each other when we lost the ball.

‘It’s important that we do that as quickly as possible when we lose it — that is the manager’s philosophy. We did a good job as a team and this is a new beginning.’

When United fans wake up this morning, Di Maria will be the name on the lips. The prospect of him teaming up with Falcao is mouthwatering indeed. But in his own way, Blind could prove to be an equally important addition to the new order at Old Trafford.
