It is a mystery that has perplexed historians for more than 400 years - what ever became of the 120 settlers who tried to establish England's first colony on the north-east coast of America?

Queen Elizabeth I and famed explorer Sir Walter Raleigh had hoped the expedition in the 1580s would create a capital in the New World, but something went terribly wrong.

The men, women and children simply 
vanished - possibly massacred by native American Indians - any evidence 
of a settlement disappeared and the infamous 'lost colony' became rooted
in American folklore.

But solving the centuries-old mystery 
may have come a step closer this week after experts identified a 
tantalising clue hidden in a map drawn by a man on that fateful voyage.

Riddle in invisible ink: The map (left) of Roanoke Island in North America drawn by John White during an attempt to create England's first colony reveals a hidden possible location for the settlement when it was illuminated from underneath (right) in recent tests. The colony disappeared in mysterious circumstances in the 1580s

Shedding new light: In this close-up of the patch at the centre of the map, a lozenge, the symbol for a fort, can clearly be seen. The symbol was drawn in invisible ink and further concealed with a piece of paper glued on top

Tests have found a hint at the possible location of what may have been intended as the colony's capital near Roanoke Island, apparently drawn in invisible ink.

The 'x-marks-the-spot' is shown in the form of a lozenge, the symbol for a fort, on the map drawn by John White, who accompanied Raleigh's first attempt to establish the colony and who led the settlers on their quest to set up the 'Cittie of Raleigh'.

The ink, which is also disguised by a
piece of paper glued to it, was likely put together using milk, citrus 
juice or urine, as was common at the time.

Its use during the 'lost colony expedition' also sheds light on an era of political suspicion at the time.

Location, location, location: Roanake Island is located just off what is now the state of North Carolina. White's maps have been praised for being particularly accurate

Were they slaughtered? This painting by White shows native North Americans dancing in a religious ceremony during an expedition in 1585. Many believe the 'lost colony' were massacre by American Indians

Folklore: John White returns to Roanake Island in 1590 to find the settlers have quite simply vanished after he had gone back to England to fetch more supplies

Among the most popular forms of invisible ink is lemon juice, but others have included urine and milk.

The acid from the citrus juice weakens the paper and can then be shown with the application of heat.

Invisible ink dates as far back as the first century, when Roman officer Pliny the Elder explained how the milk of the thithymallus plant could be used.

During the American Revolution, British and American spies used a mixture of ferrous sulfate and water for a similar effect. 

During the late 19th and early 20th century, carbon copies were used for secret writing.

The CIA used a paper that contained a special chemical that would be invisibly transferred to a second sheet of paper. 

The message could then be developed by using water or heat.

Plotters were attempting to place 
Catholic Mary Queen of Scots on the throne and there were concerns the 
map may be found by court spies.

Now farmland, the site will be excavated, it was expected to be announced today.

Professor
Brent Lane, from the University of North Carolina and a director of the
First Colony Foundation, who made a request for tests to be carried out
on the map, said he delighted with the findings.

'I marvelled at it,' he told The Independent. 'It was as if Sir Walter Raleigh had sent me an email saying "This was my... capital"'.

White drew the map - in pen, brown ink and watercolour - after setting out on the voyage in the 1580s.

A notable artist, his map is considerably accurate and his other works are held in the British Museum.

Having landed in North America, the settlers realised they had insufficient supplies, so White went back home to get more.

But when new stocks arrived, they had completely disappeared.

By the time they landed in 1587, it was too late to plant crops for the season, so White returned to England for supplies.

However, White arrived in England to find his country at war with Spain.

Constant
sea battles closed the Atlantic to nonmilitary vessels and prevented 
his return to the coast of North Carolina until 1590.

He found that the settlers he had left behind on Roanoke Island had completely disappeared.

It is believed they may have re-located to Croatoan Island (now Hatteras Island), but this has never been proved.

In 1607, after several failed attempts, Jamestown in the Colony of Virginia became the first permanent settlement in what is now known as the United States.

It would serve as capital of the colony for 83 years.
