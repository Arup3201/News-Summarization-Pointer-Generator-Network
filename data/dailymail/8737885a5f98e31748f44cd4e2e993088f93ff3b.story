Broke, on the dole, a failed last ditch High Court appeal to clear his name, facing lengthy jail sentences for sexual assault and plotting his wife's murder, Man Haron Monis walked into the Lindt Cafe on Monday morning a man at the end of the line.

Just three days earlier his all consuming desire to clear his name had for all practical reasons come to an end.

The 50-year-old, who almost two decades earlier had fled Iran accused of scamming thousands from innocent citizens, faced widespread exposure as a sham Islamic cleric if convicted on more than 50 sex charges.

Monis had taken up a number of jobs and aliases since arriving in Australia, where he was known as Michael Hayson, Michael Hassan, Michael Hayson Mavros, Mohammad Hassan Manteghi (his real name), Shiekh Haron and, finally, Man Haron Monis.

Three days before he stormed a Sydney cafe with a shotgun Man Haron Monis had an appeal against conviction rejected in the High Court

His 'profession' had ranged from psychic to spiritual healer, and it was in the latter job which he practised at Wentworthville and other western Sydney locations which resulted in sexual asault and indecency charges stretching back to 2001.

After six years on unemployment benefits, Monis couldn't even afford the $1000 bail on the charges in April, relying on his girlfriend's mother to pay up.

And last Friday morning, just three days before he took a shotgun to Martin Place, Monis was rebuffed yet again.

After reluctantly pleading guilty to twelve charges of sending malicious notes disguised as 'sympathy letters' and making phone calls to he families of Australian soldiers killed in Afghanistan, Monis had taken his case to the High Court.

On Monday he took 18 hostages and held many of them in the Lindt Chocolate Cafe in Sydney for over 16 hours

He had already been rejected by the NSW Court of Criminal Appeal (NSWCCA). He had already taken his case - that charges of using a postal service or similar to menace, harass or cause offence were unconstitutional - once to the High Court.

In February last year, six members of the High Court returned their judgement. It was a split decision, divided evenly between three male judges who agreed with Monis that the charges were unconstitutional.

Three female judges ruled that the appeal court decision that the charges against him were constitutional should hold.

Last Friday Monis went to the High Court again. Represented by Sydney barrister Guy Reynolds SC, he made an application to remove the Appeal court decision to the High Court.

Separated from two adult daughters back in Iran, Monis had also been denied contact with his two sons - now aged 10 and four years old - in a long running custody battle with his ex-wife's family

By 10am, the court's Chief Justice Robert French and Justice Stephen Gageler swiftly dismissed his application.

Monis, who was not present in the court, was telephoned and told his bid had failed.

Separated from two adult daughters back in Iran, Monis had also been denied contact with his two sons - now aged 10 and four years old - in a long running custody battle with his ex-wife's family.

Following a bitter and vengeful relationship with the children's mother Noleen Hayson Pal after she ended it in 2011, Monis had been charged with intimidating her but was lucky enough to have the charge and an Apprehended Violence Order against him dismissed in May 2012.

In April the mother of Monis' children Noleen Hayson Pal was stabbed 18 times and set alight in the stairwell of his western Sydney flat in Werrington

But in April 2013, Ms Pal was stabbed 18 times and set alight in the stairwell of his western Sydney flat in Werrington and seven months later, in October last year, police charged Monis with accessory to murder.

His girlfriend, Amirah Droudis, a Greek Australian Muslim convert was charged with Ms Pal's murder.

Ms Droudis was also charged over the hate letters, for aiding and abetting Monis. In September last year, Monis told police he had known Droudis for six years but that their relationship had not begun until May 2013 - the month following Ms Pal's murder.

Seven months later, in October last year, police charged Monis with accessory to murder while his girlfriend Amirah Droudis was charged with Ms Pal's murder

Ms Droudis was due to appeal her charges in court next February, the same months Monis would face a trial on the multiple sex charges, including two of inciting a teenage girl to commit an indecent act.

No date had been set for the murder trial.

But it was the mark against his name over the poison pen letters which had dominated Monis's thoughts since 2009, as he went from the District Court to the Court of Criminal Appeal, to the High Court and back to the High Court again, only to be rebuffed.

Seventy-two hours later, Monis took a shotgun into Martin Place.
