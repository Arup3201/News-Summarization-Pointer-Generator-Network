This is the hair-raising moment a fearless Brazilian puts three tarantulas in his mouth without even flinching.

Daredevil Arteval Duarte scooped the spiders off the ground calmly placed them in his mouth in a revolting yet oddly fascinating stunt caught on camera.

Arteval performed the stunt to bring attention to harmful deforestation in the Amazon and the threat it poses to native species and villagers.

He has been nicknamed the ‘Ninja of Serpents’ thanks to similar antics involving snakes he has found in the wild.

Recorded in the state of Para in northern Brazil, the footage shows Arteval handling two of the venomous spiders, including one that digs its retractable claws into his skin.

He appears to be stacking them on top of each other when he reaches down and grabs a third as it attempts to scurry away.

One of the arachnids gets loose as he tries to add the third to the tarantula sandwich, so he calmly shoves it into his mouth.

The fearless Brazilian allows the spiders to crawl out on their own after holding them for a few moments

He fumbles with the other two before tilting his head back and placing them into his mouth alongside their friend.

For a few moments the large, hairy spiders wriggle about in a bid to escape until Arteval places his hand against his chin. One-by-one the spiders crawl out without any sign of harm.

In another recent stunt, Arteval wrapped a snake around a tarantula and placed both in his mouth.

Arteval said he has been charming and training poisonous animals for more than 15 years.
