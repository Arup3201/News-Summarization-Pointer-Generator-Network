A pensioner, 82, who drove the wrong way on a motorway after missing his turn-off, killed himself and another driver in a 100mph head-on crash.

Cyril Titcombe was driving his wife Sheila home from Bristol airport after a holiday in Ibiza, when he did a U-turn on the M4 and started travelling west along the eastbound carriageway before he collided with an oncoming car halfway between junction 14 at Hungerford and 13 at Newbury on July 7.

Mr Titcombe was killed instantly while the other driver, Tunay Guillym, 48, who was travelling 70 to 80 mph in the fast lane at the time of the collision, was rushed to John Radcliffe Hospital but was later pronounced dead.

Deadly U-turn: Cyril Titcombe, 82, missed his turn off and so did a U-turn on the M4 and started travelling west along the eastbound carriageway when he collided with an oncoming car near Newbury (pictured)

Mrs Titcombe was knocked unconscious but survived the horrific crash with just a broken arm.

In a statement read at the double inquest at Newbury, Berkshire, she told how the couple had been driving their Mazda 323 from Bristol airport to their home in Swindon, Wiltshire.

The couple had made the journey many times for the annual holiday to the Spanish holiday island, where they had been for the last 29 years, but usually travelled back during the day.

This time however they had to drive home at night after their flights were changed, landing at Bristol at around 9.30pm.

She said that she had noticed her husband had missed the junction as he travelled along the M4.

Mrs Titcombe said: ‘I said to Cyril “where are you going?” I told him to find somewhere to turn around.

‘He said he was and we carried on driving for 10 minutes. I was very tired and nodding off.’

Mrs Titcombe said she then saw a turn-off and the couple came off the motorway to turn around.

She said: ‘The next thing I remember was a really loud bang, I realised we had been hit by a car.

‘I said to Cyril “what have you done?”’ He was pushed to my side of the car.

‘I think I was knocked out and when I came around there was glass smashing everywhere and I heard a noise like cutting, maybe it was me being cut out (by the fire brigade).’

'I said to Cyril "where are you going?" I told him to find somewhere to turn around.'

Crash investigator Tony Reading told the coroner that a post mortem examination showed that both men died as a result of injuries sustained in the crash, although Mr Reading felt that Mr Guillym, who also lived in Swindon and was driving a Volkswagen Passat, could have survived if he was wearing a seatbelt.

He said: ‘Mrs Titcombe was subjected to the same level of force. She is a lot older and less fit than a 48-year-old man and it’s my feeling that the injury would have been a lot less.

‘I’m not saying he would have survived but he stood a better chance of surviving.’

Mr Reading said he thought Mr Titcombe’s car was travelling between 10 and 60mph, while Mr Guillym’s was going at 70 to 80mph at the time of the crash, although he did not think that the damage was indicative of a 130mph impact.

Mr Titcombe would have only had to travel a further five miles to leave the motorway safely.

Mr Reading said that although police had been told that Mr Titcombe’s car was driving in the wrong direction, there would have been little that officers could have done to stop him.

He said: ‘You wouldn’t have a police car go on the wrong carriageway. If you came across this you would stay in your own carriageway and do all you could to signal to him to pull over and stop, or alert other traffic.

‘It’s a nightmare scenario when you get a vehicle travelling the wrong way on a motorway.’

The inquest was told that Mr Titcombe had been concerned about his poor memory prior to the crash.

Accidental deaths: Mr Titcombe died instantly after colliding with Tunay Guillym's car. He was rushed to John Radcliffe Hospital (pictured) but was later pronounced dead

He had visited his doctor about it and was prescribed treatment for hyperthyroidism, which was thought to have been causing the problems.

Michael Burgess, assistant deputy coroner for Berkshire, recorded a verdict of accidental death for both men Mr Titcombe drove the wrong way down the road.

He said: ‘It is impossible to know the speeds but an estimate in excess of 100mph is probably correct.

‘Both received injuries, Mr Titcombe dying at the scene, Mr Guillym dying subsequently at the John Radcliffe hospital, to where he had been moved.

‘Mr Titcombe entered onto the motorway clearly by accident.’

HGV driver Steven Daly said that he saw a car, thought to have been Mr Titcombe’s, perform a U-turn.

He had been delivering newspapers from Newport, South Wales to Didcot, Oxfordshire, when he saw the car slow down in front of him.

He said: ‘I wondered whether he got confused, thinking that was a turn-off.

‘I could see he stopped in the first lane, I’m approaching, slowing down and I thought this was strange and should I pull over or overtake but before I could make my mind up the car did a u-turn and went up the eastbound carriageway in the third lane.’

Another driver, Benjamin Smith, said he alerted the emergency services after spotting the car travelling in the wrong direction on the quiet motorway.

He said: ‘My wife saw a car coming towards us in the first lane, going in the opposite direction.’

Russell Thirkettle had also been driving on the M4 when he was overtaken by Mr Guillym’s car, which he thought was travelling at 80 to 85mph.

He said: ‘I could see the car that past me was about 100 metres in front. There was a glimmer of brake lights and the car inclined violently.

‘He swerved to his right, then the impact. It all happened within a fraction of a second.

‘He didn’t have time to put the brakes on, there was an explosive collision.

‘I had the windows up and the radio on, it was deafening from 100 metres back.’
