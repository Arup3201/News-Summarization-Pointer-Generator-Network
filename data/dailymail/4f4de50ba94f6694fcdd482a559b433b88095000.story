Police say a man walked out of a New Jersey prison after serving 15 years for robbing a children's shoe store, headed straight back to the same shop and robbed it again.

In 1999, Christopher Miller - then 25 - was arrested after he forced employees into the back room of the Stride Rite shoe store on Hooper Avenue in Toms River, tied them up and fled with cash.

After serving a 15-year sentence, Miller was released on Friday from South Woods State Prison in Bridgeton, NBC reported.

Police say Miller, now 40, took a bus from Atlantic City to Toms River on Saturday, and went to the same shoe store.

Re-offending at its worst: The day after Christopher M. Miller finished a 15-year prison sentence for robbing a Stride Rite store in Toms River, he committed an almost identical crime at the same store, police said

Employees tell police that he entered the store at 4.21pm and demanded cash, telling the workers - a 17-year-old boy and 43-year-old woman - to go to the back room.

He was not believed to be armed and the workers refused to follow his orders.

He became agitated, according to police, and took the cash register drawer, which had $389 inside.

He then took the workers' cell phones, the store phone and fled on foot.

The employees still managaed to call 911 and police responded immediately.Â 

Police say they found Miller a few blocks away, with the cash stashed in a gutter and the phones in a garbage can.

Toms River Police Chief Mitchell Little says he has to wonder whether Miller considers prison life home.

On Saturday, Miller took a bus from Atlantic City to Toms River, returned to the same Stride Rite store at 1358 Hooper St, and committed a second robbery

Just as he did in 1999, Miller demanded the Stride Rite workers to go to the rear of store, however they refused. Miller was not armed, it is believed

'Maybe that's the only life he knows, and the only thing he could think of was going back to the same store and doing the same crime again - getting caught and going back where he was taken care of and told what to do and getting meals and shelter and everything else,' he said.

Police say Miller lists Tulsa, Okla. as his last address.

His connection to Toms River is not clear.

He is charged with robbery - again - and is being held on $100,000 bail.

Back in 1999, Miller was sentenced to 15 years in prison for for three armed robberies in Toms River and Brick, as well as theft, criminal restraint and possession of a weapon for unlawful purposes.
