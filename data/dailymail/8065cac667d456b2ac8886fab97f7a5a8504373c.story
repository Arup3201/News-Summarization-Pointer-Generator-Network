Mother-of-one Della Callagher died in 2012 of food poisoning after eating a reheated Christmas dinner

A pub chef and his manager have both been jailed and the company has been fined £1.5 million after a reheated Christmas dinner left mother dead and dozens seriously ill. 

Mehmet Kaya and Ann-Marie McSweeney, the chef and manager of the Railway Hotel in Hornchurch, Essex, were jailed at Snaresbrook Crown Court for 12 months and 18 months respectively for perverting the course of justice.

Mitchells and Butlers, the chain which owned the pub, was fined £1.5 million after being found guilty of placing unsafe food on the market.

Della Callagher died and 32 others fell ill after eating the meal at the Railway Hotel in Hornchurch on Christmas day 2012.

Today manager Anne-Marie McSweeney, 40, was jailed for 18 months and head chef Mehmet Kaya, 37, for 12 months for perverting the course of justice by falsifying records.

And pub chain Mitchells and Butlers was fined £1.5million pounds for having 'manifestly inadequate' food safety measures in place.

The company was fined the huge amount so it recognises the 'seriousness of the offence' and so its management and shareholders recognise the need to 'operate within the law,' the judge said.

It was found guilty of placing unsafe food on the market by a jury at the end of last year.

Mrs Callagher, 46, became unwell on Boxing Day and her devastated husband told the court how his wife began shaking and her eyes rolled back into her head.

Guests paid £39.95 for a meal which had been cooked the day before and re-heated on Christmas day.

The diners developed a type of potentially fatal form of food poisoning called Clostridium perfringens after a turkey breast was not prepared properly.

After the outbreak landlady McSweeney and Kaya disposed of all the waste food, preventing health inspectors from taking samples. They also forged kitchen records.

They were both found guilty of perverting the course of justice for falsifying food safety records.

Pub chain Mitchells and Butlers was found guilty of placing unsafe food, namely turkey meat, on the market by not ensuring food hygiene rules were followed.

Fining the company, Judge Alastair Hammerton at Snaresbrook Crown Court, said: 'The company had become aware of the risks [prior to the incident] of cooking, cooling, and re-heating, turkeys but had took manifestly inadequate steps in addressing that risk.'

Landlady Anne-Marie McSweeney and chef Mehmet Kaya were jailed for 18 months and 12 months each

He added: 'The company is a substantial concern, with a turnover of £1.96billion and a pre-tax profit in the region of £125million.

'In these circumstances, my judgement is that fine should be £1.5m. This figure is of a level that recognises the seriousness of the offence, taking into the company's means.

'It brings home to business management and shareholders the need to operate within the law.'

He added: 'They was a systematic failure in record-keeping at the Railway Hotel.'

Addressing Kaya and McSweeney, the judge said: 'Following the discovery of the food poisoning outbreak on December 26, Mrs McSweeney and Mr Kaya, you both embarked upon the fabrication of the kitchen's due diligence logs.

'I am satisfied that you, Mrs McSweeney, were in charge of the process and caused Mr Kaya to get involved.'

Two victim impact statements were read to the court, from Mrs Callagher's husband John and her father Daniel O'Leary.

Mr Callagher struggled to control his emotions as his statement was read out by the prosecutor Andrew Campbell-Tiech: 'When Della was killed our lives fell apart, Della's passing was completely avoidable and all three defendants appear to have little, or no, indications what their actions have caused.'

It added: 'Life will never be the same, my daughter Nancy, will now grow-up without Della by her side, and that is simply unforgivable.'

Mr O'Leary added: 'I've lost my zest for life.'

During the trial Mrs Callagher's husband John, who was also struck down by the food bug, described his wife's death as 'horrific.'

Mr Callagher, 53, said: 'I was getting increasingly concerned as the day went on. The vomiting and diarrhoea wouldn't stop. Della was a very private person. It was horrific to see what was going on.'

He took his wife to A&E but her condition deteriorated on Boxing Day.

'She got far, far, far, worse. It was horrific.

'Something changed. I felt her physically shake and her eyes rolled, as if she was having a cardiac arrest.'

She was rushed to Queen's Hospital, Romford and pronounced dead at 8.15am on December 27.

McSweeney, who worked for the company for 24 years, and Kaya were both cleared of one count of placing unsafe food on the market.

The pub were ordered to pay a victim surcharge of £120, and Kaya and McSweeney were each ordered to pay £100.

The court heard that the cost of the trial to the public purse was £273,000. However, the court has yet to decide if, or how much, of that sum will be paid by the pub chain. 

The court heard that on Christmas Day 2012 the pub put on a lunch for 128 customers.

But turkey meat prepared the day before was not cooled properly after it was cooked, and then was not adequately reheated before it was served to guests.

Diners were left with food poisoning and two days later Mrs Callagher died.

The court was told that food safety records had not been filled in, and so McSweeney, of Hornchurch, Essex, who had worked at the hotel for 24 years, concocted a plan for her and Kaya to falsify them.

The pair 'covered their own backs' by retrospectively filling out false due diligence logs over the cooking, cooling and reheating of the meat before environmental health inspectors could carry out an investigation.

Prosecuting, Andrew Campbell-Tiech QC told the court it was 'highly likely that other food-related records were fabricated'. 

Mr Campbell-Tiech told the court that, although records prior to that December were unavailable, 'the inference is that for many, many months record-keeping and policies diverged'.

He added: 'Ms McSweeney was clearly in charge of the process of fabrication and caused a number of others to be involved in it, including members of staff and her family.'

Interviews with staff were not disclosed, and nor were records such as stock transfer logs which may have shown where the turkey came from.

The pair were acquitted at the trial of a charge of placing unsafe food on the market, of which the Ember pub's owner Mitchells & Butlers was found guilty. 

Speaking after the hearing, Osman Dervish, Havering Council's Cabinet member for regulatory services, said: 'Our condolences go out to the Callagher family, who have been in court throughout the trial.

'We hope that this morning's result will act as an impetus for all food providers, both local and across the country, to ensure that their food hygiene regimes are thorough and robust.'

David Travers, for Mitchells and Butlers said: 'this case was a tragedy, it's beyond argument that the incident had terrible consequences and the company deeply, deeply regrets it.'

He added: 'The tragic death of Ms Callagher is an aggravating feature, if the company had been following procedure, the staff could have been more effectively reminded of how to cook, cool and reheat the turkey.'

Janick Fielding, for McSweeney, said: 'She was at all times very sorry for what happened and her remorse which was clearly there for all to see was real.

He added: 'It wasn't falsification prompted by any realisation that they had committed any specific error but a realisation that the form filling that had been required of them by their company had not been done.'

He said that since the incident, McSweeney has lost both her job and also her home because she lived at the Railway Hotel.

She has been living with her family on benefits, and Mr Fielding said she has no hope of getting a job in the catering industry again.

He said: 'It's sad that someone of her capabilities should be laid so low.'

Nigel Sangster, for Kaya, said: 'it was clear from the evidence that he was put under pressure to fill in these logs and he was told what to put - when he fabricated these records it's not because he was aware of what had happened or was aware of the death, it was because records that should have been had not been filled in.'

Judge Alistair Hammerton said: 'The essence of this offence is that the company was aware of the risks relating to the cooking, cooling and reheating of turkey meat, and the weekly bulletin was a wholly ineffective way of alerting staff to these risks and disseminating information.'

Sentencing McSweeney to 18 months imprisonment, he said: 'You knew of the death of Mrs Callagher, and persisted with your cover-up.'

Jailing Kaya for 12 months he said: 'You also knew of the death of Mrs Callagher but you too persisted in the cover-up, I accept that there are mitigating factors.

'First of all you were in a subordinate position and were directed by Ms McSweeney to embark upon a course of conduct that left you in a difficult position.'

McSweeney, from Hornchurch, Essex, was cleared of one count of placing unsafe food on the market but found guilty of one count of perverting the course of justice.

She was also cleared of obstructing a police officer.

Kaya, from Purfleet, Essex, was cleared of one count of placing unsafe food on the market but convicted of perverting the course of justice.
