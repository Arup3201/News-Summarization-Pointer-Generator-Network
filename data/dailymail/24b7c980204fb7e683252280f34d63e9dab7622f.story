Under pressure: Ed Miliband's Labour has received more than £18million in ¿soft loans¿ from the Co-op Bank

Labour has received more than £18million in ‘soft loans’ from the Co-op Bank – which is to be the subject of an independent inquiry ordered by Chancellor George Osborne.

Documents lodged with the Electoral Commission reveal the Co-op has been propping up the Labour Party for years with a string of generous loans and overdraft facilities at rock-bottom rates.

The party is facing acute embarrassment over its links with the troubled lender, which David Cameron told the Commons had been ‘driven into the wall’ by its disgraced former boss Reverend Paul Flowers.

The Co-op is seeking a £1.5billion 
recapitalisation after being plunged into crisis thanks largely to bad 
loans associated with its takeover of Britannia Building Society in 
2009.

Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg today called Flowers' rise to the top of the Co-op Bank 'extremely murky'.

'I'm sure the Labour Party will want to both account for itself but also make sure that, in addition to all the question marks that still exist about the way in which they act almost as puppets on the end of a string for the trade union bosses, that they are not also in hock to some slightly off characters at this bank,' he toldLBC 97.3.

The Prime Minister told the Commons the debacle needed to be investigated thoroughly.

The Government’s first priority was to safeguard the Co-op Bank and ensure customers and bondholders were protected, he said, but he raised a series of questions about Flowers’s suitability for a top banking job and his links with Labour.

Government sources said an inquiry was likely to be ordered within days by the Prudential Regulation Authority, under powers Mr Osborne obtained in the 2012 Financial Services Act.

A separate investigation could be launched by the Financial Conduct Authority into whether the bank broke City rules.

The £18million in Co-op loans to Labour include £4million over seven years in 1999 at an interest rate of 6.8 per cent, £2million in 2007 for five months at 2 per cent above base rate, a £2million ‘emergency overdraft’ in 2009 at 5 per cent above base rate, and £1.2million over six months in 2006 at  2 per cent above base rate.

Labour’s latest Co-op loan, worth £1.2million, was doled out in March this year, just weeks after Ed Miliband invited Flowers to his Commons office for private talks.

The Co-op’s sister organisation, the Unity Trust Bank, lent Labour an identical sum on the same day.

Both loans were arranged at an interest rate of just 4 per cent – far lower than the Co-op offers to its own loyal customers – and were made despite Labour’s poor credit history.

Tory MP Brooks Newmark said the scandal surrounding Flowers, a former Labour councillor, had ‘peeled back an unhealthy and poisonous relationship between Labour and the Co-op Bank’.

Mr Brooks, a member of the Commons Treasury committee, said the revelations raised disturbing questions about whether Labour was turning a blind eye to disastrous governance at the bank.

He added: ‘Given its dire financial circumstances the Labour Party would normally struggle to get loans from anyone other than Wonga.

'But because of its cosy relationship, which means Labour has been able to place councillors and members in key positions at the Co-op Bank, it has continued to have access to these extraordinary soft loans.

‘Ordinary customers of the Co-op Bank and shoppers at Co-op stores will be astonished that their money is being used to make huge donations and loans at very soft rates to Ed Balls and Labour.’

Mr Miliband has attempted to distance himself from Flowers in recent days, after the Methodist preacher was filmed buying hard drugs, including crack cocaine and crystal meth.

But details have emerged of a cosy relationship between the two men.

Mr Miliband and shadow chancellor Mr Balls hosted a Downing Street reception for Flowers and other Co-op grandees in 2010.

The Labour leader then went on to appoint him to his elite Business and Industry Advisory Board.

Mr Miliband also held a secretive meeting in the Commons with Flowers on March 6 this year.

Three weeks later the Co-Op Bank approved the £1.2million loan to Labour.

In the Commons, Mr Cameron suggested Labour knew about Flowers’s ‘past’, before the drugs and porn claims emerged.

He said: ‘Why was Reverend Flowers judged suitable to be chairman of a bank? Why weren’t alarm bells rung earlier, particularly by those who knew?’

The Prime Minister said Mr Osborne was ‘discussing with the regulator what is the appropriate form of inquiry’.

He told Mr Miliband: ‘What we can now see is this bank – driven into the wall by this chairman – has been giving soft loans to the Labour Party, facilities to the Labour Party, donations to the Labour Party, trooped in and out of Downing Street under Labour, still advising you, and yet now we know all along they [Labour} knew about his past.

‘Why did they do nothing to bring to the attention of the authorities this man who has broken a bank?’

Mr Miliband told Mr Cameron: ‘You’ve taken millions from tax exiles and tax avoiders, your party has never paid back the money from Asil Nadir – and they’re just the people I can talk about in this House.’

Treasury Select Committee chairman Andrew Tyrie said: ‘The Treasury Committee strongly recommends that any review into the Co-op Bank be conducted by an independent person.

'The authorities cannot be seen to be marking their own work.’
