Botox injections are being tested to see if the drug can help men who suffer from premature ejaculation.

Researchers at Tulane University in New Orleans injected male rats with the drug to see if it made any impact on how long they lasted during intercourse.

The length of intercourse was then compared to their pre-injection performance.

Researchers found the rats lasted much longer after they were injected with the drug - which is made from one of the world's deadliest toxins Botulinum.

The data was then published in the latest Journal of Sexual Medicine.

Now a two-year trial on 60 human volunteers is being rolled out across the country to see if Botox could help those suffering from premature ejaculation.

Men between 18 and 50 who are currently in long-term monogamous relationships are eligible for the trial - which is being conducted in both London and Belfast by the drug's manufacturer Allergan.

A selection of the volunteers will have the drug injected in to a muscle at the end of their genitalia - while others will receive a placebo.

Dr John Dean, the former president of the International Society for Sexual Medicine, said the trials were 'worth investigating'.

However, he warned the drug must be administered by medics who were familiar with the drug.

The doctor added the treatment may have to be repeated once the drug wears off.

Around one in four men suffer from premature ejaculation - and it is the most common sexual problem among young men.

According to the NHS Choices website, a man who regularly ejaculates within one minute would be regarded as having a medical problem that requires treatment.

Comparatively, a study of 500 couples from five different countries found the average length of intercourse was five-and-a-half minutes, the site says.

A number of things are thought to contribute to premature ejaculation. They include stress,    relationship problems, anxiety, previous traumatic sexual experiences and depression.

Some methods of treating the condition include taking selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) - which are a type of antidepressant which can help delay climax. Others find couples therapy can help.

Botulinum is a lethal toxin which can kill if injected or inhaled. It can cause botulism - a serious and life-threatening illness in humans and animals.

Botox is often used to smooth wrinkles and lines - particularly on the face.

In 2012, the NHS announced it was to use Botox to treat chronic migraines.

The move was based on guidance from the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE), which recommend it could be used to treat people who have chronic migraines.

They said the treatment must only be used on people who have headaches on at least 15 days of every month - eight of which must be migraines.

They must also have tried three prior preventative drug treatments.
