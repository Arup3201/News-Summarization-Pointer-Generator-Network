The family of jailed Australian journalist Peter Greste have apologised for a 'poorly worded' post on Twitter that raised speculation he would be deported.

His family tweeted on Tuesday that 'the Presidential Decree has been invoked' in reference to a newly introduced law allowing Egyptian President Abdel Fattah as-Sisi to deport foreigners who have been sentenced to prison or facing trial.

Followers of the Al-Jazeera journalist were quick to speculate about what the post meant and some even congratulated Greste on being granted deportation.

'The Presidential Decree has been invoked. We are now waiting for respective governments to meet, discuss and negotiate possible deportation,' the full tweet read.

Greste's family took to Twitter on Wednesday morning to clarify and apologise for the misinterpretation. 

'A poorly worded tweet which was misinterpreted. We apologize for the misunderstanding. We are just saying that all the paperwork has been submitted and we are hoping that negotiations can now begin to try to seek deportation. We sincerely apologize for the confusion,' the post read.

Parents of Al-Jazeera journalist Peter Greste, Juris and Lois, are holding out hope their son will be released from the Cairo prison he has been held in for a year

A Cairo court last week ordered a retrial after Greste, and two of his Al-Jazeera journalist colleagues, were convicted of aiding the blacklisted Muslim Brotherhood.

Greste, Canadian-Egyptian Mohammed Fahmy and Egyptian Baher Mohammed have been held for more than a year in prison.

The Australian journalist was sentenced to seven years in prison alongside Fahmi, while Mohammed was handed 10 years last June.

The families of Greste and Fahmy both say they have applied to the government for deportation. 

In November, the Egyptian government issued a new decree granting President Abdel Fattah al-Sissi the power to deport foreign defendants convicted or accused of crimes.
