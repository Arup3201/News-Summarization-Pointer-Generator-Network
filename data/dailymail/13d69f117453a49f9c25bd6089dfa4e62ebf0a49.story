Mesut Ozil has beefed-up in an attempt to reinvigorate his Arsenal career.

The £42.5million man made his return to action after four months on the sidelines with a knee injury against Stoke on Sunday.

And the Germany star was noticeably more muscular than he was during his previous appearance in October against Chelsea.

Ozil's arms are certainly smaller in March last year compared with how he looked against the Potters

And Sportsmail can reveal, increased upper body and core strength work was incorporated into Ozil's rehabilitation programme to prepare him for the rigours of Barclays Premier League football.

While Ozil's quality on the ball has not been questioned since his arrival from Real Madrid 18 months ago, his slender frame has led to suggestions that he can be bullied by top-flight defenders.

But his new muscular frame should help ensure the attacking midfielder can stand up to the physical nature of the English top-flight.

The 26-year-old came on as a late substitute in the win over Stoke and is now in contention to start against Manchester City at the weekend.

'It feels great to be back on the pitch after such a long time on the sidelines. I worked hard for this moment,' said Ozil.

'As I watched the matches on TV I started to get nervous, because I really wanted to play again.

'Of course I am not at 100 per cent, I only trained with the team once on Saturday, but I hope that I will be back at 100 per cent by the end of January.'

Ozil came off the substitutes' bench in the 73rd minute to make his comeback appearance against Stoke
