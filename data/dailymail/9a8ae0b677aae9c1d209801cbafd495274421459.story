Princess Diana leaked information about the Royal Family to reporters to show the ‘forces that were ranged against her’, it was claimed yesterday.

She sought out journalists as allies in her bitter divorce battle with estranged husband Prince Charles and gave them information to ‘take him on’, the Old Bailey heard.

News of the World journalist Clive Goodman said she sent him an internal phone directory for the Royal Household to reveal the size of Charles’s palace staff and complained she felt ‘swamped’ by his aides.

Goodman is accused of paying public 
officials for Royal Household directories but told the phone hacking 
trial that Diana sent the directory to him at work and called him twice 
to ask if he had received it.

He
 said the book, dated from 1992, arrived at his desk in an envelope, but
 he did not think he was the only one to receive one from the princess. 
The internal phone directory was known as the Green Book.

Goodman
 said: ‘She was going through a very, very tough time. She told me she 
wanted me to see this document, she wanted me to see the scale of her 
husband’s staff and household compared to hers.

‘She was in a very bitter situation with the Prince of Wales at the time and she felt she was being swamped by his household.

‘She
 was looking for an ally to take him on, to show the sort of forces that
 were ranged against her. We were quite a powerful organisation to have 
as an ally.’

Charles and Diana separated in 1992 after an 11-year marriage and the warring Waleses set up separate households.

Goodman,
 56, the former royal editor at the now defunct Sunday tabloid, was 
asked if he was the only journalist she had sought out as an ally. ‘Oh 
gosh no, there were several journalists,’ he replied. ‘She was very 
close to Richard Kay at the Daily Mail, she was very close to Andrew 
Morton who went on to write her biography, and she was forming a 
relationship with Martin Bashir at Panorama.’

Diana
 eventually gave an interview to Panorama in 1995, in which she 
complained her husband’s relationship with Camilla Parker Bowles meant 
there were three people in her marriage. The couple divorced shortly 
afterwards.

Goodman told the
 court he was given two more directories by a former valet for Prince 
Charles, Kenneth Stronach, and said the valet was ‘thoroughly fed up 
with working for the Royal Family and the Prince of Wales particularly’.

He
 said he used the directories as a ‘glorified phone book’ to contact 
press officers and senior members of the household about stories outside
 normal office hours.

Following
 Diana’s death in 1997, he said, the palace press office was ‘frankly 
useless’ so he called the Queen’s private secretary in the early hours 
for a ‘very frank conversation’.

He
 told how following her death, amid public anger at a perceived lack of 
respect from the royals, there were demands for a flag to fly at 
half-mast over Buckingham Palace.

The
 palace refused because of ‘stuffy protocol’, he said, but a flag 
suddenly appeared for 20 minutes at half-mast and then disappeared 
again. Press officers told him it was a mistake but he used the 
directories to find an ‘enraged’ fireman at the palace who admitted he 
had hoisted the flag in protest.

Police
 found 15 directories at Goodman’s home when he was arrested in 2006 
over phone hacking. He said he could not remember where the other 
directories had come from but said he had never paid a police officer 
for any directory, or for information for a story. He also denied using 
the directories to help him to hack phones or  ‘blag’ information.

The
 jury was told Goodman worked at the News of the World for 20 years 
before he was arrested for phone hacking in 2006. He admitted hacking 
and was given a four-month jail sentence and sacked from the newspaper, 
although he later accepted a £140,000 settlement over a claim of unfair 
dismissal.

He was then 
arrested again in 2011 by police investigating hacking at the tabloid, 
and denies two charges of conspiring to commit misconduct by paying 
public officials for royal directories.

Goodman
 is not accused of hacking in this trial although he is named as part of
 an alleged plot in which former News of the World editors Rebekah 
Brooks and her successor Andy Coulson are accused of conspiring to hack 
phones.

They both deny the conspiracy and all seven defendants in the trial deny all the charges against them.

The trial continues.
