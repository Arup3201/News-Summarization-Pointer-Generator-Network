Nicola Adams has taken the boxing world by storm in the last few years, winning gold at London 2012 and also at the Commonwealth Games in Glasgow last week.

But the boxing sensation appears to have met her match - and it isn't in the shape of an opponent in the ring - but in the weather.

However it isn't dealing with the elements outside that has caused the West Yorkshire star problems, but trying to relay it as a weather forecaster.

Giggles: Nicola Adams bursts into laughter as she tried to present the regional weather

Getting in the flow: Adams managed to maintain some composure to eventually bring the weather forecast

Finding form: Adams looked nervous during the broadcast but improved as she grew into the role

Adams attempted to present the regional weather forecast as the Leeds-born star visited ITV studios, having tasted Commonwealth gold for England after defeating Northern Ireland's Michaela Walsh in Glasgow last week.

And while we can appreciate that such a job is much harder than it looks, it certainly seemed to get the best of Adams who for once showed a rather nervous display with the pressure on.

Despite a few nervous giggles, Adams did manage to complete the forecast. Although given her strengths inside the boxing ring, we would advise to let the gloves do the talking in future.
