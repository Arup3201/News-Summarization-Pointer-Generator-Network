Ravel Morrison has been training with his new club Lazio as he moves on from being released from West Ham United.

The Hammers terminated Morrison's contract early in February and he is set to begin a four-year deal with the Rome-based club in the summer after signing a pre-contract agreement earlier this year.

While Morrison is unable to play for his new side until the 2015-16 season, manager Stefano Pioli has seen fit to introduce the 22-year-old to his training sessions in a bid to help the new signing get used to life in the Italian capital.

Morrison was pictured at the club's Formello training base getting into the groove of things having not made a first-team appearance since December 6 when he turned out for loan club Cardiff City against Rotherham.

Morrison only made two appearances under Hammers boss Sam Allardyce this season; with his last outing coming in a 3-1 home defeat to Southampton back on August 31.

A series of disciplinary problems had hampered his progress at Upton Park and he was loaned to Birmingham, Queens Park Rangers and Cardiff City - with his three-month deal at the latter cut short earlier in December.

However, the England Under 21 international will now look to resume his career in Italy next season.
