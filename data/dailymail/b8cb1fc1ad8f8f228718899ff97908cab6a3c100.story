A former chief of staff for Tennessee Senator Lamar Alexander, has been found dead after committing suicide while awaiting court proceedings on child pornography charges.

Jesse Ryan Loskarn's lifeless body was found Thursday by family members in their Sykesville, Maryland, home, and officials told MailOnline the former Senate staffer killed himself by hanging.

The accused pedophile, 35, had been released last month from jail to live with parents Chuck and Gay Loskarn.

Police discovered child pornography on Loskarn's hard drive after raiding his home as part of an investigation of a Canadian film-maker.

New allegations: Loskarn wrote that he was sexually abused as a child and that is what drew him to child porn

'We loved our son very much, and we’re devastated by his death,' they said in a statement released to Politico. 'Please respect our privacy at this difficult time and let us grieve in peace. Pray for him, his family and friends.'

Loskarn was on conditional release at the home provided he wear a GPS monitoring bracelet and have no access to the internet.

'At approximately 12 p.m. yesterday, Carroll County Sheriff’s Deputies responded to a private residence.. for a report of an unconscious male, believed to be deceased,' authorities said in a statement.

'Family members reported finding 35-year old Jesse Ryan Loskarn unresponsive in his basement where he’d been residing with family since [December 16].'

Rising star: Loskarn had worked as the chief of staff to Republican Senator Lamar Alexander for two years (seen together in January)

The death was ruled a suicide Friday by the State Medical Examiner's Office, it was first reported by Politico.

'The cause of death was hanging and it was by suicide,' medical examiner's office spokesperson Bruce Goldfarb confirmed to MailOnline.

'For everyone involved, this is a sad and tragic story from beginning to end,' Sen Alexander said in a Friday morning statement.

Loskarn's lawyers had successfully argued for his conditional release by saying the 
35-year-old had no prior convictions or arrests and 'deep ties' to the community.

Magistrate Judge John Facciola ordered Loskarn to be confined to his parents' despite objections from prosecutors

Those objections included statements he is alleged to have made while in custody that suggested he was a suicide risk, according to reports.

His lawyer dismissed the notion, saying Loskarn taking his life was 'not a concern.'

Loskarn's parents appeared in court for the hearing, 
and his father stood with his arm around his mother as she told the 
judge that they have no home computer and that cellphones and iPads were 
password protected.

They promised to ensure their son would have no access to the Internet.

Loskarn was arrested last month and 
faced up to 10 years on possession charges and a minimum of five and 
maximum of 20 years on distribution charges.

Filings cited by the Tennessean showed multiple delays in the prosecution of charges against the former Senate aide, possibly hinting at a plea deal being in the works.

Loskarn had served as chief of staff for the Republican senator for two years up until his arrest.

According to a filing with the U.S. 
District Court last week, police used a ram to enter Loskarn's home the 
day it was searched, and noticed that he put something on the ledge outside a 
window.

It turned out to a portable hard drive with videos depicting child pornography, according to the filing.

The filing states that, in 2010, the U.S. Postal Inspection Service and Toronto Police Service were investigating a movie production company whose films feature young nude boys, and discovered the former political operative made several purchases from the company in 2010 and 2011.

Federal investigators then identified Loskarn's residential IP 
address on a peer-to-peer network offering files 'with names that are 
consistent with child pornography broadcasting as a download candidate,' the filing continued.

Loskarn
 was a rising star who had spent the past decade working his way up to 
increasingly important posts in the House and then the Senate.

Republican Senator Alexander said in a news release the day of the arrest that he was 'stunned, 
surprised and disappointed' by the allegations against his newly 
departed staffer.

Alexander
 initially placed Loskarn on unpaid leave, but before the end of the 
day, he had replaced Loskarn with David Cleary, the senator's 
legislative director.

Rep. 
Marsha Blackburn, another Tennessee Republican for whom Loskarn had 
worked as communications director, said she was 'shocked, saddened and 
stunned.'
