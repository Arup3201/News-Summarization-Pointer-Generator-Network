It's not often Mark Wright and fiance Michelle Keegan team up with Liam Payne and Benefit Street's White Dee.

But these famous faces all appeared in a video made by romantic Paul O’Leary, 27, from Stafford,  to propose to his girlfriend.

Paul asked the celebrities to cameo in the video he made for girlfriend, Natalie Heathcote, 26, in which he  popped the question.

Paul spent weeks contacting the couple’s favourite celebrities and put together the video to play before he got down on one knee during a trip to New York.

Not all of the big names were able to take part though, so sadly 'Liam Payne' was actually just a friend donning a mask but the rest all appeared.

In the video, White Dee says to the camera; 'Natalie, Paul loves you and wants you to marry him!’

It then cuts to Mark Wright in his car, who rather amusingly fluffs his first attempt at a well-wish.

He says: 'Lee, I’m Mark Wright and I’ve met your fiancé. Wait, let’s go again.' The former TOWIE star then nailed the sweet message, saying: 'Natalie, I’m Mark Wright, and I’ve just met Paul, and you should definitely say yes because he’s a top geezer.'

Next up is Michelle Keegan, pictured sitting down ON the floor, dressed down in jeans and a black vest.

Her message is short but sweet: ‘Please say yes Natalie!’

The video then cuts to Paul himself, with perhaps the most affectionate message of all.

'Natalie, please give me a yes and make me the happiest man alive, I love you,’ he says, before blowing a kiss to the camera.

The
 couple had been together three years before Paul decided to compile the
 video of friends, family and celebrities for his big gesture on 
Brooklyn Heights Promenade.

He finally picked the secluded spot in New York for its great views of Lower Manhattan to ask the big question.

Lucky for him, Natalie said yes straight away.

Star power: Deirdre Kelly, aka, White Dee, from the TV show Benefits Street, pictured here, made a cameo in Paul O'Leary's proposal video, too

'It’s all just been crazy and overwhelming,' said teacher Paul 'But we’re so happy together.

After I had asked her and before she answered I said, "Wait - watch this" and I played her the video on my phone.

'She loved it as they were all our favourite celebrities and she started crying as she watched.

'We were big fans of Benefits Street and Natalie loved White Dee’s personality so it was great when she agreed to do the video.'

Not the real Liam Payne! A friend dons a comical
 mask of the One Direction star's face, encouraging Natalie to say yes 
to Paul's proposal, whilst 

Paul explains that even though he deliberately picked a quiet spot, one passerby guessed that they'd just got engaged.

'They said, "Oh
 my, did you two just get engaged?"' says Paul. 'There were only a 
handful of people around as I wanted it just to be the two of us.

'We’re just really pleased. We couldn’t be happier and we’re looking forward to the future.'

Dee
 - real name- Deirdre Kelly said: 'It brought a tear to my eye. It was a
 reminder of old-fashioned values - romance is not dead.'

The couple are planning to marry in two years time after a long engagement.
