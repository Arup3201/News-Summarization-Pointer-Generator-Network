Blanked: The family of nurse Jacintha Saldanha, who committed suicide after transferring a call about Kate Middleton, have received no answers from her employers King Edward VII Hospital

The family of a nurse who committed suicide after answering a hoax phone call about the Duchess of Cambridge have received no answers from her hospital bosses despite sending them 40 questions.

Instead, Jacintha Saldanha’s family have been told by King Edward VII Hospital – where the pregnant duchess was being treated for acute morning sickness – that they will have to await the outcome of an internal inquiry which may answer some of the questions.

Ms Saldanha’s husband and two children have also received no answers from Australian radio station 2Day FM, which was behind the prank, despite sending the broadcaster 20 questions before Christmas.

The radio station’s parent company, Southern Cross Austereo, has written back, merely stating that an official inquiry by Australia’s media watchdog was under way.

So far, Southern Cross Austereo has not made any attempt to contact Ms Saldanha’s family to express their condolence or apologise for the hoax call, which has received international condemnation.

Ms Saldanha, 46, was the duty nurse when DJs Mel Greig and Michael Christian called King Edward VII pretending to be the Queen and Prince Charles, asking about the duchess’s condition.

She forwarded the call to another nurse, who divulged confidential medical information about Kate. The prank was broadcast by 2Day FM within hours, and made headlines around the world.

Ms Saldanha was found dead in the nurses’ quarters three days later, having hanged herself with a scarf. 

Her accountant husband Benedict Barboza, 49, son Junal, 17, and daughter Lisha, 14, sent King Edward VII 40 questions before Christmas, in their search for answers.

But hospital chief executive, John 
Lofthouse wrote back, saying he could not give detailed answers as an 
internal inquiry  is being conducted by the chairman, Lord Glenarthur.

Mr Lofthouse wrote: ‘Many of the 
questions which you attached to your letter will be, or already have 
been, addressed by our inquiry. I would expect that our council will 
provide .  .  . a copy  of the conclusions.’

Southern Cross Austereo said in its 
letter: ‘Southern Cross Austereo is co-operating with the Australian 
Communications and Media Authority official inquiry in Australia.’

Labour MP Keith Vaz, who is acting as
the family spokesman, said: ‘I welcome the fact that the hospital is 
conducting an internal inquiry.

'I feel that it would have been in the
family’s best interest that there should have been an independent 
element of the inquiry rather than it being chaired by Lord Glenarthur.’

The inquest into Ms Saldanha’s death will begin on March 26.
