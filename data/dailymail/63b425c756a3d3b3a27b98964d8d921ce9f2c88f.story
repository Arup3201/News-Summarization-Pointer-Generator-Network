The infamous ‘London Whale’ trading scandal which rocked the City has landed America’s biggest bank JPMorgan Chase with a £570 million fine.

The huge settlement includes a £137.6 million fine from the UK watchdog the Financial Conduct Authority, the second biggest penalty ever levied by British financial authorities.

The remainder of the penalties will be paid to US authorities, including the Federal Reserve. 

Payout: JP Morgan was forced to hand over a £570 million fine following the 'London Whale' scandal

Yesterday the UK watchdog said the losses of £4 billion racked up by a group of traders in London ‘sent a shockwave through the markets’.

In a damning statement, the FCA’s director of enforcement and financial crime Tracey McDermott accused the blue blooded investment bank of ‘failing to be open and co-operative with the regulator.’

She said: ‘We consider JPMorgan’s failings to be extremely serious such as to undermine the trust and confidence in UK financial markets. This is yet another example of a firm failing to get a proper grip on the risks its business poses to the market.’

Crisis: JP Morgan CEO Jamie Dimon (pictured in 2009) was dubbed the King of Wall Street but has seen his reputation tarnished by the debacle

The bank has agreed to settle actions brought by US authorities, paying $300 million (£190 million) to the Federal Reserve, and $200m (£120 million) to both the US Securities and Exchange Commission and the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency.

In one of the biggest trading scandals to hit the City, a group of London based traders working in the firm’s Chief Investment Office made huge bets on complex financial instruments and then covered up their losses for months.

One of the traders, French born Bruno Iksil was nicknamed the London Whale because of the size of his bets.

Two former traders face criminal charges in the US. But Iksil will escape prosecution because he co-operated with US authorities.

Yesterday the UK watchdog also blamed top bosses of JP Morgan for failing to react quickly enough to the scandal, which first became public in April last year.

McDermott said: ‘As things began to go wrong, the firm didn’t wake up quickly enough to the size and the scale of the problems.

'What is worse, they compounded this by failing to be open and co-operative with us as their regulator.’

JP Morgan’s boss Jamie Dimon, who has been dubbed the King of Wall Street, has seen his reputation tarnished by the debacle.

He initially dismissed the losses racked up by his team of London based traders as a ‘tempest in teapot’.

Yesterday he said: ‘We have accepted responsibility and acknowledged our mistakes from the start, and we have learned from them and worked to fix them.’
