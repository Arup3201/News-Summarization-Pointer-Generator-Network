A son finally heard his dead father’s voice for the first time - after unearthing a lost, original recording of the 70’s hit song ‘Seasons In The Sun’.

In 1970, musician Alan Ludley was tipped for fame when asked by Polydor Records to record an unknown French folk song with the lyrics: 'We had joy, we had fun, we had seasons in the sun.'

But when Alan, from Middlesbrough, was killed in a car crash, his version was never released - so singer Terry Jacks recorded it instead and got a 1974 hit, selling 10million records.

Emotional: Adrian Ludley, 43, broke down in tears after hearing his dad's voice for the first time after listening to an original recording of hit song Seasons In The Sun

Alan left behind a one year-old baby who although photographed once with his father, could never recall his voice.

Now
Adrian Ludley, 43, has finally found a copy of his dad’s studio 
recording, thanks to a local appeal - meaning he can finally hear his 
dad for the first time.

A 
BBC Inside Out documentary reveals Adrian's extraordinary search for the
song and it’s remarkably poignant lyrics - of a son saying farewell to 
his father for the last time.

Viewers
see Adrian break down in tears as he listened to his late father 
singing the ominous words 'Goodbye Papa, it’s hard to die'.

He said: 'Nothing could top this in my life, this is just amazing. It’s the best experience ever.

'Definitely I’ve found a reconnection with him, it’s just incredible. The perfect closure for my search.'

‘Seasons In the Sun’ by Canadian singer Terry Jacks remains one of the best known pop songs of all time, and became a Christmas Number 1 in 1999 for Westlife.

It was an adaptation of the song ‘Le Moribond’ by Belgium songwriter Jacques Brel in 1961 with lyrics by American singer-poet Rod McKuen.

The Jacks version is one of the fewer than thirty all-time singles to have sold 10 million (or more) copies worldwide.

But years before Jacks shot to fame, a newly-signed band in Middlesbrough called Rivers Invitation had recorded their version of the song for Polydor and it was all set for a 1970 summer release when tragedy struck.

Alan, who was the band's singer, was killed aged 23 in a car crash, Rivers Invitation disbanded with their debut single unreleased.

It left his baby Adrian to be raised by his grandparents, before moving on to start adult life in California.

As he approached his 40’s with children of his own, Adrian became determined to find out more about the father he could not remember.

He embarked on a quest to find a 
recording of the Rivers Invitation version of Seasons in the Sun and to 
hear his dad sing the words which had become loaded with added poignancy
because of his sudden death - ‘goodbye to you my trusted friend. 
Goodbye my friend it’s hard to die’.

Four years ago Adrian contacted BBC Tees presenter John Foster for help and an appeal to listeners did help to find some recordings and photographs, but not Seasons In The Sun.

Adrian told listeners at the time: 'The song that I’ve been searching for and what everyone has told me was the recording of Seasons in the Sun.

'It would be absolutely amazing if that ever came about - huge. I’d never experienced any of his music.

'Since the accident, since I was a kid I would search but nothing ever came of it so I could only really imagine what his voice must have sounded like.

'The first time I was told he recorded Seasons In The Sun I didn’t believe it.

'It was too much because of the magnitude of that song and how everybody knew it.

'It was the first 45 record I ever bought and I would listen to it in 
my bedroom over and over and imagine how he would sing it.

'It would be amazing to actually get that song because that’s what triggered it all, that’s what motivated me.'

After four years of trying, Adrian feared the song had been lost forever, but it was then discovered in an old tin of junk in band member Peter Ayton’s house. 

The song was played to Adrian and Inside Out got the band members back together for the film.

And after hearing the emotional recording together, Adrian broke down in tears and uttered: 'Thank you all so much.'Adrian's story is told on Inside Out BBC One (NE & Cumbria) on Monday  January 16 at 7.30pm and can be seen the following day by viewers outside the North East & Cumbria on the BBC iPlayer.
