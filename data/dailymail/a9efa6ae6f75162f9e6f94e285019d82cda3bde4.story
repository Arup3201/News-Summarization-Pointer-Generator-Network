The creators of How I Met Your Mother have apologized for having three characters dress up in 'yellowface' and wear stereotypical Asian costumes for a fantasy sequence.

In keeping with one of the show's long plot lines of prepping a 'perfect' slap, one of the characters sought advice from three wise 'slap masters' who were Asian variations of three of the main characters.

The show creators issued an apology on Wednesday via Twitter, acknowledging their misjudgement and urging viewers to see the mistake as an unintentional one.

Taking offense: Colbie Smulders was one of the three main characters who was dressed to look Asian in Monday night's episode, prompting backlash

Insensitive: A number of Twitter users thought that they should have hired Asian actors

'With Monday's episode, we set out to make a silly and unabashedly immature homage to Kung Fu movies, a genre we’ve always loved. But along the way we offended people. We're deeply sorry, and we’re grateful to everyone who spoke up to make us aware of it,' Carter Bays wrote.

'We try to make a show that's universal, that anyone can watch and enjoy. We fell short of that this week, and feel terrible about it.

'To everyone we offended, I hope we can regain your friendship, and end this series on a note of goodwill,' he wrote, referencing the fact that this is the CBS sitcom's final season.

Co-creator Craig Thomas said that he agreed with everything Bays wrote and apologized once more. 

White face: Alyson Hannigan's skin looked even more pale than normal, suggesting that they used geisha-style lightening products to make her fall into the stereotype

Not just the girls: Josh Radnor was given a fu manchu mustache

The backlash from viewers was instant and many started using the hashtag #HowIMetYourRacism.

'#Yellowface doesn't get you better ratings, it just makes people want to boycott your network,' one Twitter user wrote.

'Really, #HIMYM?? You couldn't even bring yourself to hire Asian actors for this?' wrote another.

In the show, Jason Segel's character seeks advice from three 'slap masters' who are his three friends- played by Colbie Smulders, Josh Radnor and Alyson Hannigan.

Imitation: The co-creators said that they meant it as an 'unabashedly immature homage to Kung Fu movies'

Smulders appears from behind a fan with a noticeably more yellow skin tone than normal. Her outfit continues with the theme, as she is seen wearing a geisha-style red silk dress with chopsticks in her bun.

Radnor is sporting a fake Fu Manchu style moustache and Hannigan's skin is clearly covered with some white makeup to make it look more pale.

All three are eating ramen throughout their respective dream sequences.

For her part, Hannigan re-tweeted the apology made by Bays while Neil Patrick Harris- who is by far the most prolific Twitter user of the cast- has not made any mention of the episode since it aired.
