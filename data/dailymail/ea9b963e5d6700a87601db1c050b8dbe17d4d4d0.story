A scuba diver has been arrested for allegedly trying to smuggle eight pounds of marijuana from Canada into the U.S. by swimming underneath a busy shipping lane.

Border agents swooped at around 1am yesterday morning after the frogman surfaced near Marine City, Michigan, on the American side of the St.Clair River.

They later recovered a waterproof canister containing the drugs, which have a street value of around $40,000, tied to a seawall ladder.

Border agents found 8lbs of marijuana in a waterproof canister after arresting a scuba diver who had swum across the St. Clair river from Canada into the U.S.

The authorities swooped after St. Clair County dispatch received a tip-off that someone was swimming across the river south of Sarnia.

A camera operator at Selfridge Air National Guard Base in Harrison Township picked up the swimmer and noticed he appeared to be towing a 'dry bag'.

Border patrol agents on the ground in Marine City, Michigan were quickly alerted and prepared a welcoming committee.

Foolhardy: Authorities described the swim across a one kilometre wide section of the St. Clair River (pictured) which is a busy shipping channel as 'very,very, dangerous'

Authorities described the swim across a one kilometre wide section of the river which is a busy shipping channel as particularly foolhardy especially in the middle of the night.

Greg Grogan, a public affairs officer with U.S. Customs and Border Protection said: 'If there’s a freighter coming through there, there’s no way for a freighter to stop. That’s a very, very dangerous thing to do.'

The man, a Canadian national who has not been identified, was handed over to the St. Clair County Drug Task Force which will prosecute the case.
