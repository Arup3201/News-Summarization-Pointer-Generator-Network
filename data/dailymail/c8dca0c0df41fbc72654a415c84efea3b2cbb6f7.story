A woman has told how she thought her head was going to explode after she used a hair dye home colouring kit.

Selma Jesus, 32, grabbed the phone to dial 999 for an ambulance when she had an allergic reaction that caused her face and head to swell dramatically.

She feared she was going to die after she used the £5.99 Clairol Nice n' Easy black dye and her eyes started to close over while her forehead began to expand.

Selma Jesus, 32, from Bournemouth, Dorset, was rushed to hospital after she tried to dye her hair and suffered an allergic reaction and her head swelled

'It was horrible and I'm still in shock. I could feel my forehead coming out.'

She admitted she did not carry out the recommended sample test of the dye on herself before putting it on her hair, because she had used different colours by the same brand in the past with no reaction.

Miss Jesus, of Bournemouth, said she was given an injection by paramedics who rushed to her home, and her GP gave her a prescription for tablets to relieve the swelling.

But she took herself to hospital a few hours later when the swelling got worse.

Selma soon noticed her face had started to balloon and called for an 
ambulance after using Clairol Nice n' Easy black dye

The reaction was still showing five days after using the black dye.

'I called an ambulance because I was desperate - now I have to take six tablets a day' she said.

A
Clairol spokeswoman said 'We are sorry to hear about this situation. 
Our consumers' safety and well-being is our absolute priority and we are
keen to help however we can.

'Reactions to hair colourants can occur for a very small number of people, in the same way that some individuals can react to a variety of foods and natural substances.

'It is clearly stated on the pack that consumers should carry out a patch test each and every time the product is used.

'Millions of people all over the world use hair colourants without experiencing any adverse effects. In the UK around 100 million hair colourant applications are carried out every year in homes and salons.

'Hair colourants are one of the most thoroughly studied consumer products on the market and their safety is supported by a wealth of scientific research.'
