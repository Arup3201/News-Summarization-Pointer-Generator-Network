A leader in the controversial Quiverfull movement - which promotes family values and male dominance over women - has resigned and closed his ministry after having an affair.

Doug Phillips, who is married with eight children, announced he was stepping down from Vision Forum Ministries, based in San Antonio, Texas, in a statement on his website on October 30.

'I engaged in a lengthy, inappropriate 
relationship with a woman,' he wrote. 'While we did not "know" each 
other in a Biblical sense, it was nevertheless inappropriately romantic 
and affectionate.'

Then on Monday, in light of Phillips' 'serious sins', the Board of Directors of the ministries concluded that 'it is in the best interests of all involved to discontinue operations'.

It added: 'While we believe as 
strongly as ever in the message of the ministry to the Christian family,
 we are grieved to find it necessary to make this decision. We believe 
this to be the best option for the healing of all involved and the only 
course of action under the circumstances.'

Phillips had asked for forgiveness in his resignation letter - and praised his wife, Beall, for her strength after he told her about his indiscretion.

'There
 are no words to describe the magnitude of shame I feel, or grief from 
the injury I caused my beloved bride and children, both of whom have 
responded to my repentance with what seems a supernatural love and 
forgiveness,' he wrote.

'I thought too highly of myself and behaved without proper accountability. I have acted grievously before the Lord, in a destructive manner hypocritical of life messages I hold dear.'

The affair indeed is at odds with what he has long been preaching; Vision
 Forum Ministries call the family 'the basic agency of dominion on 
earth' and claims it 'is under attack from every side today' - including
 homosexuality and feminism.

Famous figure: Phillips' ministry promotes the 'Biblical patriarchy' and male dominance over women

While Phillips led his own ministries, he was also a famous adherent to the Quiverfull movement, which is also followed by Jim Bob and Michelle Duggar on TLC’s '19 Kids and Counting'

The Quiverfull is a Christian evangelical movement in which followers avoid contraception and have as many children as they can.

It is based upon Psalm 127:3-5, which says in part: 'Lo, children are an heritage of the Lord: and the fruit of the womb is his reward... Happy is the man that hath his quiver full of them.'

The movement also advocates a return to 'traditional' roles in the home, where a woman is a wife and mother before anything else. Followers believe women are designed to support their husband as head of the household.

In the US, Quiverfull families often reach up to a dozen children with the numbers of adherents in the tens of thousands.

He
preaches that a man is called to 'rule over his household' and 'the 
God-ordained and proper sphere of dominion for a wife is the household'.

His
 ministries also reject birth control and believe that large families 
are a sign of God's blessings - an attitude reflected by his friends Jim
 Bob and Michelle Duggar on TLC’s '19 Kids and Counting'.

In order to 'exercise dominion' over 
growing families and carry out his 200-year plans, he teaches families 
to home school their children.

The schooling teaches girls domestic 
duties, while boys are taught to uphold 'Biblical' gender norms by being
 chivalrous and adventurous. College education is for them only.

In this climate, his wife, an adherent of his conservative teachings, is left with no options.

Julie
 Ingersoll, an associate professor of Religious Studies at the 
University of North Florida, wrote for the Huffington Post that the community is unlikely to support Phillips' wife.

'The leaders (all male) are 
likely to be sympathetic the husband's "temptation" and should she 
discuss the situation outside of the sanctioned forums controlled by men
 she will be denounced as a gossip,' she wrote.

'Sometimes the women are blamed: the 
"other woman" as Satan's temptress and even the completely innocent wife
 for having "let herself go" or being inadequately submissive.'

Apology: Phillips, pictured center with some of his family members, asked for forgiveness - and commentators said it is likely his community with support him and, if anything, blame the women in the situation

Growing family: He is close friends with the Duggar family (pictured) - the stars of TLC's '19 Kids and Counting' and fellow adherents of the Quiverfull movement

He has earned a tidy sum by preaching
 this message. In 2011, his ministry reported $3.3 million in revenue 
and Phillips received $44,000 in salary for a 30-hour workweek for the 
ministry.

Phillips' influence over his community is far reaching.

He began working as an attorney at the Home School Legal Defense Association and has become a popular speaker at home school conventions.

Phillips has also been active in the Tea Party in San Antonio.
