There were scenes of chaos and devastation today as clashes erupted while dozens of illegally-built houses were demolished in a Roma suburb in Bulgaria.

Two people were reportedly arrested as the authorities moved in to begin to demolish the 55 homes in the Lozenets district of the Bulgarian city of Stara Zagora.

According to reports, three officers were injured as occupants of the site threw stones and tiles during the confrontation.

Almost 1,000 Gendarmerie members were at the site as the homes were demolished today, along with fire trucks and ambulances.

According to Bulgarian news agency Novinite.com, citing Nova TV, Mayor Zhivko Todorov ordered the homes be bulldozed this morning.

The plan had previously been due to take place in May but was postponed due to security concerns.

Two police officers and one gendarme received minor bruises and injuries in the confrontation, according to Novinite.com.

Todorov said: 'None of the residents 
indicated that they want to buy the right to build. If they want to be 
accommodated somewhere, they must submit the necessary papers'.

Pictures taken at the scene show bulldozers demolishing the homes in the Roma suburb.

Residents can be seen walking through the rubble, salvaging materials, while one woman merely sits among the destruction with her hand to her face.

Shocking pictures emerged last week of a Roma teenager who was beaten and left for dead in a supermarket trolley in France.

Vigilantes kidnapped the 16-year-old boy,
 known only as Darius, from the camp he shares with his family near the 
northern commuter town of Pierrefitte-sur-Seine on the outskirts of 
Paris.

The thugs rang the youngster's mother demanding a €12,000 ransom for the safe return of her son.

The figure was later reduced to €4,000, but when it was not paid, the gang battered Darius before dumping him in a shopping trolley before leaving it on the roadside.

Doctors in a Paris hospital placed Darius in a medically induced coma following Friday's brutal assault, which has left him fighting for his life.
