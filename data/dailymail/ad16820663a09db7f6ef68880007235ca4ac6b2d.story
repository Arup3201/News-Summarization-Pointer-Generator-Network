Finally, down a quiet side street a few miles from my home, I found the address I was looking for.

Spiked metal gates protected a rather foreboding forecourt where a generously sized man was standing, shirtless and missing some teeth, hosing down an old red car.

Behind him were about 15 dust-covered other old vehicles, all sporting heavy-duty wheel clamps. Among them was my trusty old VW Golf.

Nicole Mowbray, from London, had her VW Golf towed away from her home, 18 months after failing to pay a fine she did now know she had. She paid £694 to get her impounded car back

To cut a long story short: my car had been seized by a debt recovery agency following an unpaid ticket for a ‘traffic offence’ that had been issued by my local council.

I was here to buy back my car from an auctioneer who had, in turn, purchased it from bailiffs.

I only found out that my car was missing one Saturday morning recently when I went to find it in the street outside my home in South London. It wasn’t where I had left it.

I scanned the road. Four of my neighbours have similar black Golfs. I could see theirs — but not mine.

Nor was there any sign — such as smashed glass on the kerb — to suggest it had been broken into and stolen. Also, the car has an immobiliser and I had both the keys in my bag.

Suddenly I began to panic. Had I driven it somewhere and forgotten where I had left it? Perhaps I’d parked it in a neighbouring road and my mind was playing tricks.

With a growing feeling of fury, I begrudgingly called 101, the non-emergency police number to report my vehicle as stolen.

This was the kind of hassle that has made me not very keen on cars. As a teenager, I wasn’t much fussed about learning to drive. I figured, as a city-dweller, it’s usually quicker, easier and less stressful to take public transport.

But I then learned to drive in my mum’s car. Driving someone else’s vehicle taught me to be careful and I’ve I’ve had no points on my licence and only one parking ticket in the ten or so years since passing my test.

As I waited on the phone to be connected to the police, I thought through what life would be like without a car if mine never turned up.

Eighteen months earlier, Nicole had performed an 'illegal manoeuvre' by turning right where it was banned. Her car was found outside her home by an Auto Number Plate Recognition vehicle

Certainly, I would save money, because motorists get fleeced. We all know driving is expensive — my council parking permit is more than £200 per year, then there’s the car tax, insurance, petrol etc.

At last, a police operator answered. Having told him about my missing car, he asked: ‘Are there any parking restrictions on your road?’ I told him there are but that I had the correct permit, an MoT, full insurance and a valid tax disc.

‘Oh,’ said the operator, who, had checked my number-plate with the DVLA. ‘Your car has been seized for an unpaid parking offence.’

I was mystified. I hadn’t got any parking tickets — and if I had, I would have paid straight away.

So I pressed a little further.

It transpired that 18 months earlier (in December 2013), I’d performed an ‘illegal manoeuvre’ on a road in nearby Clapham, turning right where I wasn’t supposed to.

While I don’t recall doing so, I didn’t doubt the police version of events. In any case, the incident had been caught on CCTV. It was, as they say, a fair cop.

The operator said I had been sent notices of the ‘penalty charge’ which I had ignored.

Yet I hadn’t received any at all.

Surely only police or councils should be 
allowed to have vehicle-recognition systems — not bailiffs. But even cowboy parking firms have access to DVLA 
records

Eventually, I discovered what had happened. I moved house last year and despite changing the address details on my driving licence, insurance policy and council parking permit, I hadn’t got my new address put on my car’s registration document until May this year, when a cashier at the Post Office who was sorting out my new car tax disc told me that I was legally bound to do so.

Apparently, under European Directive 1999/37/EC, vehicle registration documents (what used to be called log-books) must contain the owner’s up-to-date address.

My failure to do so was an oversight, but naively, I’d assumed that when you changed details on your driving licence with the DVLA, they would automatically update all your details. But I was wrong, and thus all penalty notices about the traffic offences had been sent to my old address.

The police operator told me this was now a ‘civil matter’ and the police would be unable to help me recover my car. He simply gave me the phone number for a debt recovery company called Equita Ltd.

Let’s just say that when I phoned them, the woman who answered didn’t sound like she was happy in her work. Rude, obstreperous and obstructive, she told me that I must pay £694 to Equita if I wanted to get my car back, otherwise it would be sold at auction in a few days’ time.

I also discovered that two days earlier, while I was at work, an Auto Number Plate Recognition vehicle (to you and me a ‘spy car’), owned by bailiffs and which has a computer linked to the council’s database, had located my car outside my house. A tow-truck was summoned to remove my £7,000 Golf to take it to an auction firm to be sold.

The Automatic Number Plate Recognition system cameras are used by police and councils, but are also used by bailiffs

All because I hadn’t paid a £130 traffic fine I knew nothing about.

I was outraged. Surely only police or councils should be allowed to have vehicle-recognition systems — not bailiffs. But I have subsequently learned that even cowboy parking firms have access to DVLA records.

I’m not alone in thinking this is outrageous: the Government has announced a proposal to ban private companies such as bailiffs from using this technology to recover unpaid traffic fines. Indeed, the Department For Communities & Local Government and the Department For Transport joined together to tackle what they called ‘unacceptable parking fine collection practices’.

In any case, how difficult would it have been for my local council of Lambeth to track me down without using bailiffs? While I was no longer at the address on my vehicle registration documents, the correct details were on my driving licence, insurance documents, MoT certificate, council parking permit and the electoral roll. All of this is computerised.

Cynically, I felt the council didn’t actually want to find me because otherwise they couldn’t fleece me of such large sums of money!

Anyway, back to Mrs Rude at the bailiffs. She told me to call back on Monday because the car pound wasn’t open at weekends. So, on Monday I called again. This time, I spoke with a fairly decent guy called Nathan. He said I had to pay the £694 to get my car back.

I explained that I’d had no notification about how these charges had accrued so asked for a breakdown of the costs. He said I had to apply in writing, but only after paying the  fee. I wasn’t even allowed to know which pound my car was in until I’d paid, because, even though Nathan was sure I wouldn’t, I might otherwise ‘go down there and cause trouble without paying for the car’.

So I just had to pay some guy over the phone £694 — with nothing in writing to confirm the ‘deal’.

To add insult to injury, when I asked for a receipt, I was told I didn’t need one. But I wanted one, I said. Again, I’d have to apply in writing. (I’ve since had a receipt, but no breakdown of costs.) How do I complain, I asked? You have to send an email and they will tell you how, he said.

Welcome to the Kafkaesque world of councils, bailiffs and traffic offences.

After I’d gone through this rigmarole, I had to wait an anxious hour — £694 poorer — for Equita to locate my vehicle and ring  me back.

Which explains how I found myself outside General Auctions Limited of Earlsfield, South-West London, a car auctioneers that specialise in selling repossessed vehicles.

It wasn’t their fault — they’re just making a living. But I am incensed by Equita Ltd and the Borough of Lambeth who seem to be making obscene amounts of money out of the  genuine mistakes of honest drivers.

Paying almost £700 to retrieve a car in which the driver had committed a £130 offence would be out of the reach of many people.

While I accept I made two mistakes (the illegal manoeuvre and not telling the DVLA of my change of address so as to amend my car’s log-book) holding people such as me to ransom for minor misdemeanours — parking  tickets, entering a bus lane, turning right at a no right turn — is criminal.

The sooner this dubious practice of using spy cars is outlawed  the better.
