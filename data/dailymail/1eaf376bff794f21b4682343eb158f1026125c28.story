A south-east Missouri man accused of killing his estranged wife, the mother of his then-five-year-old triplets, has pleaded guilty to murder.

James Clay Waller II, 42, was given a 20-year 
prison sentence on Thursday after pleading guilty to second-degree murder 
and admitting inside a packed Cape Girardeau
County courthouse that heÂ  choked his wife Jacque Waller, 39, to death before burying her 
body on a nearby island in the Mississippi River nearly two years ago.

Prosecutors originally charged Clay Waller with first-degree murder last year, despite the fact that Jacque Waller's body hadn't been found. His guilty plea to the lesser charge was conditional on his leading detectives to his wife's body.

Abuse: Jacque Waller's husband murdered her after a meeting with divorce lawyers more than two years ago

Left behind: Jacque Waller's seven-year-old triplets are being adopted by her sister, Cheryl Brenneke

Neither Jacque Waller's sister Cheryl Brenneke nor Circuit Judge Benjamin
Lewis were happy with the lighter sentence, but were left 
with few options, since Waller was the only person who could lead 
authorities to Jacque Waller's body.

Guilty: James Clay Waller II leaves the courtroom after pleading guilty to second-degree murder for the death of his wife, Jacque Sue Waller at the Cape Girardeau County Courthouse in Jackson, Missouri

Authorities finally found 39-year-old Jacque 
Waller's body on May 29 in Alexander County, after she had been missing 
since 2011.

The plea deal ensured a conviction for Clay Waller and offered grieving 
family members closure in the case.

'I did not want this deal,' said Brenneke, who has custody of her sister's now-seven-year-old triplets and plans to adopt the two girls and one boy.

'My mother and father and these children deserved to bury her, though.'

Judge Benjamin Lewis acknowledged that 'there will 
be a number of people critical of this plea agreement. However none of 
those critics could provide the body of Jacque Waller.'

'That
is not what you deserve, but it will have to do,' he said in handing 
down the 20-year sentence to Clay Waller. Under the original charge of 
first-degree murder, Waller could have faced the death penalty or life 
in prison without parole.

'It was decided that it was more important to get Jacque back,' said County prosecutor Chris Limbaugh.

Clay Waller is already serving a 
five-year term in federal prison for threatening Brenneke over the 
Internet. His sentence in the murder case will run concurrent with the 
federal case, officials said.

Jacque Waller went missing on June 1, 
2011, the same day she and her husband met with a divorce lawyer and 
argued over money. The had been living in separate houses for three 
months prior to the meeting.

The
Honda Pilot belonging to Jacque Waller was found along Interstate 55 
with its tires slashed the day after she disappeared. It had been seen 
the day before at Clay Waller's home. Several searches since then turned
up sporadic leads, including the discovery of her purse near where the 
car was found.

Memories: In a statement on their Facebook page Waller's family confirmed 'with a heavy heart' that Jacque Waller's remains were found

The FBI 
said last year that Clay Waller suggested to his father that he had 
broken Jacque Waller's neck and buried her in a hole that he had dug in 
advance. But Clay Waller made no confessions to police, and his father 
died before he could testify against his son.

During
the hearing, Clay Waller heard a taped statement from his 
own seven-year-old son in which the boy disowned him. 'I never want 
to see you again for my entire life,' said the boy, calling his father a
'big, fat jerk.'

Disowned: In a taped statement to the court, Clay Waller's seven-year-old son disowned him, telling his father, 'I wish you weren't my dad.'

'You killed our mom,' the child said in a taped statement. 'I thought you were a good guy. Now I know you're not ... I wish you weren't my dad.'

Before her death, Jacque Waller had 
again found love with a new boyfriend, her sister said Thursday.

Brenekke spoke to Waller with rage and contempt, telling him: 'To someone who has always 
considered himself the smartest guy in the room, you just look like a 
skinny, washed-up, murdering con man to everyone in this room.'

'I knew immediately that you killed my sister.'

Split: James Clay Waller and his wife Jacque were on the verge of a divorce settlement when he lured her to his house and murdered her in 2011

Waller didn't look up as he admitted his guilt.

'We got in an argument,' he said, describing an assault on his wife at the Jackson home he was living in after the couple split. 'I lost my temper.'

But investigators said Waller had planned to kill his wife, digging a six-foot hole in the sand on the banks of the Mississippi River the previous day and scouting out the burial location via helicopter.

Cape Girardeau Sheriff John Jordan said Clay Waller lured his wife to his home by convincing her that their son was there when the child was actually with Clay Waller's girlfriend.

A funeral for Jacque Waller is scheduled for Saturday in Park Hills, Missouri.
