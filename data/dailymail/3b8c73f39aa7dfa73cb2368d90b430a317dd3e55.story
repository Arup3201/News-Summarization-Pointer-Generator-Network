Donald Sterling has been rejected by eight different law firms as he tries to file a lawsuit against the NBA.

The disgraced LA Clippers owner has been banned from the NBA and is reportedly hoping to prevent a forced sale of the team following the racist recordings of him speaking to his alleged mistress.

TMZ reports that the 81-year-old billionaire has approached eight major law firms asking them to represent him but he has been rejected by them all.

Turned down: Donald Sterling has reportedly approached eight different large law firms to help him sue the NBA over his lifetime ban but all of them are believed to have turned him down

The names of the specific Los Angeles and San Francisco-based firms have not been released but they were described as being extremely large and prestigious.

Legal sources told the site that the firms are worried that it would lead to bad publicity if they accepted him as a client.

They reportedly fear that not only would any of their African American clients get upset, but also with their scandal-averse corporate clients.

The rejections have reportedly come as personal insults to Sterling because he has doled out favors- and Clippers tickets- to partners at the respective law firms in the past.

These reports come hours before a taped interview with the embattled owner is set to air.

Sterling sat down with CNN's Anderson Cooper and apologized, the full tape of which will be shown later tonight.

'I'm not a racist,' he said in the

'I made a terrible mistake. I'm here to apologize.'

In his first public comments since being banned for life from the NBA, Sterling said years of good behavior as an owner should count toward his future.

'I'm a good member who made a mistake,' Sterling said. 'Am I entitled to one mistake, am I after 35 years? I mean, I love my league, I love my partners. Am I entitled to one mistake? It's a terrible mistake, and I'll never do it again.'

The interview came nearly two weeks after NBA Commissioner Adam Silver banned Sterling, fined him $2.5 million and urged the other league owners to force him to sell the team.

Sterling said he waited to make a public apology because he was 'emotionally distraught.'

'The reason it's hard for me, very hard for me, is that I'm wrong,' Sterling said. 'I caused the problem. I don't know how to correct it.'

He later added, 'If the owners feel I have another chance, then they'll give it to me.'

Sterling's comments came on the same day ABC News posted excerpts of an interview his estranged wife gave to Barbara Walters.
