An Alabama man was fined after being pulled over by police in Georgia for 'eating while driving'.

Madison Turner, a computer software engineer, almost choked on his food after being told by police the reason for him being stopped was for consuming fast food whilst in the fast lane.

The officer wrote him up under Georgia's distracted driving law which states: 'a driver shall exercise due care in operating a motor vehicle on the highways of this state and shall not engage in any actions which shall distract such driver from the safe operation of such vehicle.'

Mr Turner has said he will fight the ticket when he goes to court next month.

Hard to swallow: Madison Turner from Alabama says he was issued a ticket in Cobb County, Georgia, last week for snacking on a just-bought burger while he was behind the wheel

Cheesed off: The officer wrote him up under Georgia's distracted driving law, saying Turner was 'eating while driving' in the ticket's comments sections

Meanwhile, lawyers familiar with Georgia's road rules say the incident is the first they've heard of anyone being prosecuted over eating whilst being behind the wheel. They believe the ticket will be tossed when it comes to court.

Mr Turner had ordered a double quarter-pounder with cheese from McDonald's last week when the officer pulled him over along Canton Road in Marietta.

Should have dined-in: 'The officer explained to me that he observed me eating a burger for 2 miles,' Madison said. 'He said specifically three times, you can't just go down the road eating a hamburger'

Both hands on the wheel! Lawyers say unless eating the burger caused an accident, there really should have been no problem with munching on a tasty burger while driving down the road 

'The officer explained to me that he observed me eating a burger for 2 miles,' Madison told WSB-TV. 'He said specifically three times, you can't just go down the road eating a hamburger.' 

Distraction? Georgia's distracted driving law is vague and the ticket will likely be tossed in court

'Maybe I was enjoying the burger too much I needed to tone it down. I was certainly willing to do so but I didn't expect to be fined or punished,' Madison said.

Lawyers say  the only time someone might be prosecuted under the law would be if an accident had occurred as a result of eating behind the wheel.

'I've only seen something like this charge when there's an accident,' William Head, a longtime traffic and DUI attorney said.

'There was no accident here so the fact that this man was charged with eating and driving is a first for me,'

Cobb County police have so far refused to comment on the case, although experts agree the law is exceptionally vague.

It is not clear how much Madison was fined.
