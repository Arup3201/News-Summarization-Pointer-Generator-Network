Harriet Harman may be reluctant to speak out now, but when the Jimmy Savile scandal exploded in 2012, she loudly demanded a judge-led inquiry.

She toured television and radio stations proclaiming ‘we need to get to the truth’ for the sake of child abuse victims.

She flatly rejected any notion that attitudes had changed or that it was a ‘different world’ years ago, insisting even in ‘historic’ cases, there were lessons to be learnt.

Loud demands: Harriet Harman (left) was beating the drum for a public inquiry as Jimmy Savile (right) was revealed in October 2012 to have abused children at schools, hospitals and the BBC

Silence: Until now Miss Harman has said only that the Mail's story is 'untrue and ridiculous' but has refused to answer any questions, as have her husband, Jack Dromey (pictured), and their Labour colleague Patricia Hewitt

Miss Harman even lectured Parliament 
that, whatever injustices had occurred in the past, they should be dealt
 with now to protect others in the future.

Her
 battle cries of 2012 contrast sharply with her silence in the past week
 in the face of questions about her role in the paedophile-supporting 
National Council for Civil Liberties (NCCL).

Miss
 Harman has said only that the Daily Mail’s story is ‘untrue and 
ridiculous’ but has refused to answer any questions, as have her 
husband, Jack Dromey, and their Labour colleague Patricia Hewitt.

In
 October 2012, as Savile was revealed to have abused children at 
schools, hospitals and the BBC, Miss Harman was beating the drum for a 
public inquiry.

1978 briefing: The NCCL legal officer Harriet Harman wrote this briefing paper on the Protection of Children Bill, which sought to ban child pornography. She argued that it would lead to an 'increase in censorship'

Argument: The second page contains a paragraph saying that a picture should not be considered indecent if the model was not harmed

Recommendations: Miss Harman's briefing went on that the NCCL would argue that the Bill to protect children should be amended

Signed: The Labour Deputy Leader's name is carried at the bottom of a briefing that argued that a pornographic picture of a naked child should not be considered indecent unless it could be proven that the subject had suffered

Only an ‘overarching’ judge-led investigation into Savile’s rampage of abuse would suffice, she argued.

Teachers, social workers and NHS staff should be legally required to give police all allegations of child sex abuse, a report into the Jimmy Savile scandal will demand today.

The report was commissioned by police and is based on interviews with more than two dozen of Savile’s victims.

They told interviewers that professionals who come into contact with children should be required to pass on any accusations handed to them.

Currently Britain lacks a ‘mandatory reporting’ law – meaning people who work with children can go unpunished if they fail to report abuse. Such laws are common in parts of the US.

Today’s report calls for a dedicated reporting line for abuse allegations and improved training for police officers.

On
 October 15, she told MPs debating Savile in the House of Commons: ‘It 
is impossible to overstate the suffering caused to those whom he abused.
 No one should be complacent.

‘This
 goes wider than just the BBC. There are still countless young women and
 men who have been abused but have never complained because they bear a 
great burden of shame, guilt and disgust, and fear that they will not be
 believed.

‘Should not our 
strong and clear message to them today be: “Come forward now, seek the 
support that you need to address the wrong that has been done to you, 
and, in doing so, not only secure the justice that you deserve but 
protect others in the future”?’

Miss Harman also called for the Home Office to be part of the historic investigation because Savile abused children at an Approved School run by the Home Office.

It is not beyond the bounds of possibility that any such inquiry, had it taken place, might have unearthed a letter sent to the Home Office in April 1978.

It was written by the legal officer of the NCCL, one Harriet Harman, and it argued that child pornography should not be banned as ‘indecent’ unless it could be shown that the child depicted had been harmed.
