Struggling to cope with the heavy 1-6 loss at home to Marseille on Friday night, it appears one frustrated Toulouse fan decided to launch a makeshift missile at opposition goalkeeper Steve Mandanda as he gave a post-match interview. 

Mandanda, though, clearly still on alert from the game, managed to catch the bottle of water thrown from the stands. 

The amazing show of reflexes was made even more impressive by the 29-year-old stopper's smooth follow up, asking the journalist plainly, 'Would you like some water?'

Marseille's victory sees them move to second in the Ligue 1 table, leapfrogging PSG and reigniting their title charge. 

They now have 53 points from 28 games, just one behind leaders Lyon who have played one game less. 

The club had not won in the league since January 31, but a brace from Belgian attacking midfielder Michy Batshuayi as well as strikes from Baptiste Aloe, Andre Ayew, Andre-Pierre Gignac and an own goal from Tolouse defender Francois Moubandje, put them back on track.
