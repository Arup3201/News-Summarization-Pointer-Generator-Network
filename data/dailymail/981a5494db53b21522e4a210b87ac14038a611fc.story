Tyson Fury pronounces himself to be ‘a uniquely athletic boxer’. Chris Eubank Jnr is perceived as a replica of his famously eccentric father.

This Saturday night in London’s ExCel, their immediate futures will be mapped out. The massive Manchester traveller and the muscular chip off the old Brighton rock have sold out the 15,700-seat arena in the Docklands.

Now both men need to take out equally ambitious rivals to move on to world title challenges.

Fury, on the eve of his rematch with Dereck Chisora from which the winner should be propelled into a mega-euros fight with Wladimir Klitsckho, has trained ‘as never before’.

So hard in fact that he was able to weigh in fully clothed and still scale under 19 stones.

Eubank makes a sudden jump in class as he takes on Billy Joe Saunders — but also a leap of faith that he will be the one to challenge the winner of next month’s fight for the vacant WBO middleweight title between Matt Korobov and Ireland’s Andy Lee.

The most extravagant boast before these Battles of Britain has come from Chris Eubank Snr, who touts his son as greater already than the legendary Sugar Ray Leonard and more dangerous than any other boxer active today — Floyd Mayweather Jnr and Manny Pacquiao included.

Yet the claim which will intrigue the sports community most is Fury’s depiction of himself as ‘the most mobile, fluent, lithe, flexible and explosive athlete in the world’. But even though 6ft 9in Fury is an incorrigible jester, he is deadly serious when he says: ‘I am a one-off. Yes, unique. I was born to be a sportsman. Not only a fighter but a champion at any sport.’

Most importantly, he points out: ‘The biggest key is my legs. They are the legs of a racehorse. Not the legs of a carthorse like most fighters who are built squat for power.’

By chance, I can confirm that he is unexpectedly agile when he wants to get in shape. One day at his old training camp in Belgium he said ‘Watch this’ and vaulted acrobatically from the floor, above the ring apron and over the ropes to land lightly on his feet in the ring. It was a startling sight.

Fury suspects that the mighty Klitschko is already aware of his physical prowess ‘and may not agree to fight me next year even though I will be his mandatory challenger’.

Klitschko had a close-up view of one of the very few heavyweights taller than himself when Fury worked out at Wladimir’s and his brother Vitali’s training camp in the Austrian Tyrol. Fury says: ‘He watched me train — but showed no inclination to spar with me. In a way I’m glad because if we do meet he won’t have the learning experience of us trading punches.’

Eubank Jnr has considerably less professional and amateur experience than his opponent

Fury claimed that his biggest assets are his legs, which he said were the legs of a racehorse 

Eubank the Younger, on the contrary, is built for the strength which he hopes will counter Saunders’ considerably deeper amateur and professional experience.

Saunders is defending his European, British and Commonwealth middleweight titles. As the champion, he is favourite.

But it is not forgotten in the Eubank household that this month sees the anniversary — the 24th — of the dramatic night when Chris the Elder, then a comparative novice, overturned the odds with that historic upset of Nigel Benn.

And of the two big fights at the ExCel, this appears the harder to call. ‘Fifty-fifty,’ plead many when asked to predict the outcome.

So it will be if Saunders allows his visibly seething anger at the deliberately provocative behaviour of the opposing camp to draw him into a slugging match. The Eubanks are calculating on a knockout if the fight turns into machismo exchanges of heavy punches.

Eubank Jnr and Saunders looks set to overshadow the main event between Tyson Fury and Dereck Chisora

But if Saunders keeps his temper and sticks to his boxing skills, he should edge a 12-round decision.

Fury, for his part, argues with conviction that in his current chiselled and athletic condition he will beat Chisora more easily than he did when they first met three years ago. Chisora, however, has rededicated himself since that defeat, taken Vitali Klitschko the distance and now scales 18lb lighter than he did three years ago at 17st 3½lb.

It will be no surprise if both men are knocked down at various stages of the fight but Fury has a consistent record of getting up after being decked — and appears to hit the harder.

It would be no great shock, either, if this one went the full 12 rounds scheduled for Chisora’s European title defence. Although that is not my expectation.

Fury should get the job done, even it is later rather than sooner.

JEFF POWELL’s predictions:

Saunders beats Eubank on points. Fury K0s Chisora in 10th.
