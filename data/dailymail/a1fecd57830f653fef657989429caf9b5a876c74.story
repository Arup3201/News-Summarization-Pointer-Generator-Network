Cristiano Ronaldo met up with Real Madrid new boy James Rodriguez as the pair returned to training in the Spanish capital.

Rodriguez joined the European champions from Monaco for £63million after impressing at the World Cup in Brazil, where he won the Golden Boot for being top scorer at the tournament.

And after a well-earned break the Colombia star reported for training at the club’s Valdebebas HQ to and joined up with his new team-mates.

Rodriguez could be in line to make his Madrid debut alongside Ronaldo and Gareth Bale in next week’s European Super Cup against Sevilla in Cardiff.

If Rodriguez, Ronaldo and Bale do start together then it will be one of the most expensive front lines ever assembled with a combined transfer value of £230m.

Real Madrid have not had the best pre-season so far, losing 3-1 to Manchester United in the International Champions Cup and boss Carlo Ancelotti said: 'We were not happy with the defeat (by United); we didn’t play well but the Super Cup will be a completely different game. 

'We can’t be ready at this stage, because some of the squad have only been training for a week. Plus the team aren’t used to playing without Cristiano and other players, so what happened (against United) is to be expected. We have to continue to prepare ourselves.

VIDEO Rodriguez's dreams are real 

'Cristiano’s determined to play in the Super Cup, that’s why I gave him 20 minutes. He needs another week to get up to speed with the team. I think he’ll be fit (for the Super Cup). There’s no reason to worry about his fitness; we’ll prepare him well and there’s no cause for concern.

'James has been training in Valdebebas and he could be ready to play in the Super Cup too. I think all the players will be ready. We only have a week, which isn’t long, but we’ll prepare well.’
