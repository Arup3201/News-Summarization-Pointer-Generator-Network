A woman in Florida allegedly set fire to a man's car after he refused to buy her a McDonald's McFlurry for dessert.

According to shocked witnesses the man and woman were sitting in the restaurant on Beach Boulevard in Jacksonville at 12.30 on Sunday morning.

Suddenly they became embroiled in a huge fight over whether or not she was entitled to one of the popular ice cream treats - at which point she went outside and proceeded to set the man's car on fire.

'They were going at it,' said witness Sabryna Maré of the couple who were standing behind her in line.

'She was saying she wanted this and wanted that, and she wanted either a McFlurry or an ice cream on top and he was not in for it. Then he was yelling at her saying he's not going to do it.'

At this point the argument escalated out of hand and the woman began making seemingly outrageous threats.

'Next thing you know, she says 'I'm going to blow it up,' and we were wondering what are you going to blow up? ' said Maré.

Smoke: The firefighters arrived to put the flames out and couldn't find any trace of the man or woman

At this point the woman burst out of the restaurant and within minutes the shocked patrons of the McDonalds saw 1994 El Dorado in flames in the parking lot.

'She got something out of the car that happened to be a bottle and then she got gasoline from who knows where. Then she poured everything all over it and next thing you know there was a match and it was up in flames,' said Maré.

Witnesses tried to put the fire out but when the firefighters arrived the car was beyond help.

The woman who is thought to have started the fire disappeared out of the parking lot and the police are keen to speak to her and the man who vanished after the flames were put out.

'It was one second here, one second there, gone. Later we saw the car parked on the side of Beach Boulevard,' said Maré.

Jacksonville Sheriff's Office officers said the license plate did not match the vehicle.
