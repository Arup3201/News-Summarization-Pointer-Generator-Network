An aide to Labour's leader in Wales has quit the party, branding Ed Miliband an out-of-touch 'Chuckle Brother' who is heading for 'inevitable' defeat in the general election.

Luke Ellis, a Labour councillor who worked for Welsh First Minister Carwyn Jones, claimed Labour strategists could not have found a leader with 'less charisma, sincerity or balls' than Mr Miliband if they had tried.

It comes as former Labour Cabinet minister Charles Clarke warned voters do not think Mr Miliband will be any better than the Tory-Lib Dem coalition.

Mr Miliband's leadership has come under increasing pressure in recent days, with senior party figures fearing he is failing to make an impact ahead of the election on May 7.

Mr Ellis, a councillor in Bridgend, announced his decision to quit Labour with an excoriating attack on Mr Miliband.

Writing on his blog, he said: 'If political strategists all got together in a room to choose a leader with less charisma, sincerity or balls, they couldn't have chosen better than the hapless Chuckle Brother they chose to lead the party to the inevitable defeat coming it's way in less than 100 days.

'There are several sources of information that outline the multimillionaire's catalogue of failures and his massive disconnect with the public could not be more obvious than it already is.'

Mr Ellis added: 'I have met both men and without a shadow of a doubt, Jeremy Kyle is more in touch with British voters than 'The wrong Miliband'.'

He also claimed Labour in Wales 'has proven to be nothing more than a cult-like mafia that is frightened of free speech'.

Mr Miliband has come under increasing criticism in recent days from senior Blairite figures in the party unhappy at the direction of his leadership.

Lord Mandelson warned Mr Miliband's plan to impose a mansion tax is 'crude' and would end up 'clobbering' people.

Lord Hutton and Mr Milburn, two senior Blairites, accused the Labour leader and Shadow Chancellor Ed Balls of failing to defend the economic record of the last Labour government. 

Now Mr Clarke, a former Home Secretary who served in Tony Blair's Cabinet, said voters did not believe Labour would be any better than the coalition.

He told The Times: 'The reason why [minor parties have] gained support is because people don't think the Conservatives, Liberals are good and they are not confident enough that Labour will do better. 'Labour's challenge is to ensure that we convince people that we would do better.

'In a general way, I think that investment and reform, which was our slogan in the Blair years, is crucial. Certainly, the party has to campaign on the NHS, but it also has to campaign on education, which is another story of investment and reform.

'It has to campaign on transport, it has to campaign on policing and a whole set of other issues.'

Mr Miliband yesterday insisted he has enough 'life experience' outside politics to lead the country - because he had been an adviser to Gordon Brown.

The Labour leader said roles in the Treasury and lecturing at Harvard University in the United States before he became an MP qualified him to be prime minister. 

Mr Miliband highlighted his previous jobs as he took questions from young voters after being asked how he represented ordinary people. 

He was asked: 'Outside of politics, what life experience do you have ... to indicate you should be the one to represent the people of Britain?'

Mr Milband, speaking at an Ask The Leaders session organised by Sky News and Facebook, replied: 'I've done a number of things which I think are relevant to this.

'I was obviously an economic adviser in the Treasury. I think that's important because the economy and how we change our economy is at the heart of the country.'

He added: 'I taught at Harvard University. I actually taught around government and economics and I think that, actually, one of the things that that did for me (was learning) to listen and engage with people about what their issues are, what they're interested in.'

Mr Miliband went to Oxford University before working briefly as a researcher in the media, and then becoming a Labour Party researcher.

He was an adviser to Gordon Brown in the Treasury between 1997 and 2002, at which point he took an 18-month sabbatical to teach economics at Harvard.
