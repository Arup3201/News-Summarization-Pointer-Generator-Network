Hillary Clinton has praised the governor of Arizona after she vetoed a bill that would have let businesses refuse to serve gays and lesbians on grounds of religion.

The former U.S. Secretary of State spoke to an audience at the University of Miami yesterday, and addressed an estimated audience of 6,100 people.

Highlighting the issue, Mrs Clinton, 66, said that Republican governor Jan Brewer 'recognized that inclusive leadership is really what the 21st century is all about.'

She added that all countries, including the U.S., must allow 'full participation' for women.

'I believe strongly that the more we can get people to participate, to have a stake in the future, the better off we will all be,' she added.

Students listening to the speech cheered when they heard Mrs Clinton's comments.

Ms Brewer vetoed Arizona's controversial religious rights bill, after facing a deadline to decide whether to sign it on Saturday.

The controversial politician faced enormous pressure to veto the legislation, even from within her own Republican ranks after the bill set off a national furor over gay rights and religious freedom.'

'My agenda is to sign into law legislation that advances Arizona,' Ms Brewer said at a news conference. 'I call them like I seem them despite 
the tears or the boos from the crowd.'

Decision time: With the clock ticking for Arizona Governor Jan Brewer finally decided to veto controversial SB 1062 on Wednesday. Here, the governor is seen mid-veto in a photo she posted to Twitter

The governor said she gave the legislation careful deliberation in talking to her lawyers, citizens and lawmakers on both sides of the debate.

The bill backed by Republicans in the Legislature was designed to give added protection from lawsuits to people who assert their religious beliefs in refusing service to gays. But opponents called it an open attack on gays that invited discrimination.

Gay rights supporters were delighted when they heard the official news of the veto signing at a rally held in Phoenix yesterday.

The bill has thrust Arizona into the national spotlight after both chambers of the state legislature approved it. As the days passed last week, more and more groups, politicians and average citizens weighed in against Senate Bill 1062. Many took to social media to criticize the bill, calling it an attack on gay and lesbian rights.

Prominent Phoenix business groups said it would be another black eye for the state that saw a national backlash over its 2010 immigration-crackdown law, SB1070, and warned that businesses looking to expand into the state may not do so if bill became law.

Facing pressure? Three Republicans who had voted for the bill last week quickly changed their minds and said in a letter to Brewer that while the intent of their vote 'was to create a shield for all citizens' religious liberties, the bill has been mischaracterized by its opponents as a sword for religious intolerance.'

Companies such as Apple Inc. and American Airlines and politicians including GOP Sen. John McCain and former Republican presidential nominee were among those who urged Brewer to veto the legislation.

 was under intense pressure to veto the bill, including from three 
Republicans who had voted for the bill last week. They said in a letter 
to Brewer that while the intent of their vote 'was to create a shield 
for all citizens' religious liberties, the bill has been 
mischaracterized by its opponents as a sword for religious intolerance.'

SB
 1062 allows people to claim their religious beliefs as a defense 
against claims of discrimination. Backers cite a New Mexico Supreme 
Court decision that allowed a gay couple to sue a photographer who 
refused to document their wedding, even though the law that allowed that
 suit doesn't exist in Arizona.

Republican Sen. Steve Yarbrough called his proposal a First Amendment issue during a Senate debate.

'This
 bill is not about allowing discrimination,' Yarbrough said. 'This bill 
is about preventing discrimination against people who are clearly living
 out their faith.'

Celebration: Cheers erupted amid protestors of the bill after Brewer's announcement was made

Surprised? Many feared the outspoken and often controversial governor might sign the bill into law as she dragged her feet with the Saturday deadline to veto looming

Democrats said it was a veiled attempt to legally discriminate against gay people and could allow people to break nearly any law and cite religious freedom as a defense.

'The heart of this bill would allow for discrimination versus gays and lesbians,' said Sen. Steve Gallardo, D-Phoenix. 'You can't argue the fact that bill will invite discrimination. That's the point of this bill. It is.'

The bill is similar to a proposal last year brought by Yarbrough but vetoed by Brewer, a Republican. That legislation also would have allowed people or religious groups to sue if they believed they might be subject to a government regulation that infringed on their religious rights. Yarbrough stripped that provision from the bill in the hopes Brewer will embrace the new version.

Civil-liberties and secular groups countered that Yarbrough and the Center for Arizona Policy, a powerful social conservative group that backs anti-abortion and conservative Christian legislation in the state and is opposed to gay marriage, had sought to minimize concerns that last year's bill had far-reaching and hidden implications.

Good business? The 2015 Super Bowl will proceed as planned in Glendale's University of Phoenix Stadium. Before the veto, NFL officials said the bill would put their decision to play in the state into question

Yarbrough called those worries 'unrealistic and unsupported hypotheticals' and said criminal laws will continue to be prosecuted by the courts.

The Center for Arizona Policy argues the law is needed to protect against increasingly activist federal courts and simply clarifies existing state law. 'We see a growing hostility toward religion,' said Josh Kredit, legal counsel for the group.

Similar religious-protection legislation has been introduced in Ohio, Mississippi, Idaho, South Dakota, Tennessee and Oklahoma, but Arizona's plan is the only one that has been passed by a state legislature. The efforts are stalled in Idaho, Ohio and Kansas.

The push in Arizona comes as an increasing number of conservative states grapple with ways to counter the growing legality of gay marriage. Arizona's voters approved a ban on gay marriage as a state constitutional amendment in 2008. It is one of 29 states with such constitutional prohibitions, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures.

Federal judges have recently struck down those bans in Utah, Oklahoma and Virginia, but those decisions are under appeal.
