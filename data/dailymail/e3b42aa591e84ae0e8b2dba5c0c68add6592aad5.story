Red-faced former England captain and Sky commentator Andrew Strauss has apologised to Kevin Pietersen after a foul-mouthed tirade against his former team-mate was accidentally broadcast live.

Strauss, at Lord’s for the match between an MCC XI and Rest of the World XI, believed he was off air during an ad break but was overheard describing South African-born Pietersen as an ‘absolute c***’ on a feed broadcast to Fox Sports.

Strauss, also born in South Africa, made the crass remark as Pietersen batted for the Rest of the World. Sky then tweeted an apology before Strauss went on air to say: ‘I apologise unreservedly, particularly to Kevin Pietersen. I am mortified and profusely sorry.’

Troubled past: Pietersen was dropped after admitting making provocative comments about Strauss

A senior Sky insider said there would be no further action against Strauss but there was outrage on social media from fans angered by Pietersen’s England exile after bust-ups with team-mates and officials.

Sky would 
not confirm the precise nature of the conversation that was accidentally
 transmitted but did tweet an apology via its Sky Sports Cricket 
platform.

It read: 'Earlier comments were made during a break of play which were heard overseas. We apologise for the language used.'

Pietersen, 34, was sacked after last winter’s 5-0 Ashes whitewash and journalist and broadcaster Piers Morgan — a Pietersen ally —called for Sky to axe Strauss. He tweeted: ‘If Strauss story is true then he’ll have to be fired, surely? Or is a commentator calling @KP24 a ‘****’ on air acceptable @SkyCricket ?’

Support act: Pietersen's close friend has called for Piers Morgan has called for Strauss to be sacked

Strauss 
fell out with Pietersen in 2012 after the batsman insulted his captain 
in text messages to friends in the South Africa dressing room.

Morgan's comments referred to a troubled past between the former team-mates.

In 2012 Pietersen was dropped after sending messages to friends in the touring South Africa side which he admitted were 'provocative'.

Those messages were reported to be highly critical of Strauss, though suggestions that they included advice on how to get the opener out have been denied by Pietersen.

After a dramatic draw with the Proteas at Headingley, Pietersen started a memorably tetchy press conference by declaring he would not wait for skipper Strauss, who was also due to speak.

Speaking after the incident, Pietersen said: 'I apologise to Straussy and the team for the inappropriate remarks at the press conference and for the texts. I truly didn't mean to cause upset or tension. I need to rein myself in sometimes.'

Strauss, who retired soon after, reflected on the issue in his autobiography, Driving Ambition.He wrote: 'For me, he had crossed the line. He seemed to be at best destabilising and at worst undermining our carefully cultivated team environment.

'I did...have issues with him criticising me to the opposition. That felt like talking out of school, not to mention giving the opposition a way to drive a wedge between Pietersen and myself and the team.'

Strauss has been conciliatory about Pietersen in much of his commentary work but it seems he may have been concealing less savoury views.

Three months ago Kevin Pietersen said he was ‘good friends’ with Andrew Strauss.

In his own mind, Pietersen may have believed it, but the accidentally aired assessment of him as a ‘complete ****’ by a man universally respected in the game, has removed any room for doubt.

In Pietersen’s eyes he is the victim of unfair treatment at the hands of the ECB. The reality is he has burned too many bridges and fallen out with everyone he has ever worked with. Fortunate to be reintegrated into the team after betraying Strauss with derogatory texts to ‘close friends’ in the South African team in 2012, Pietersen was also divisive in Australia last winter.

Perhaps he did not realise how he had hurt Strauss with the ‘textgate’ affair with his former captain subsequently writing in his autobiography: ‘For me, he had crossed the line. He seemed to be at best destabilising and at worst undermining our cultivated team environment.’

He was eventually sacked because he had become a toxic figure, with senior players unable to trust him and unwilling to put up with him taking the contrary line on almost every decision current captain Alastair Cook or senior management attempted to make.

While other stars of cricket chose to refrain from talking about other matters ahead of the Lord’s bicentennial match between the MCC and Rest of the World, Pietersen used the platform to remind the public of his desire to play for England again, blaming his downfall on media ‘spin’.

Saturday’s bicentennial game — which saw Australian leg-spinner Shane Warne break his hand after being hit by a beamer from former team-mate Brett Lee — was completely overshadowed by Strauss’s gaffe regarding Pietersen. 

He retains a degree of support among the public and was warmly applauded to the crease yesterday before making 10 off 13 balls. 

But he has little support in the England dressing room while senior ECB figures insist their stance has hardened since his sacking. 

His ‘friends’ are simply not in the right places.                                                      SAM PETERS
