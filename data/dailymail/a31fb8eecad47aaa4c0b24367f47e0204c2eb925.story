Two British contractors were among 13 people killed when a suicide bomber rammed a military convoy in Afghanistan, the Foreign Office said.

Five coalition troops and eight civilian contractors were killed in the Kabul attack yesterday, Nato said.

The Taliban suicide bomber hit an armoured Nato vehicle as the convoy was passing the American University in the city.

A Foreign Office spokesman said: 'Two British nationals were among those killed in yesterday's attack in Kabul.

'Next of kin have been informed. Consular staff in Kabul are in close contact with the employer of the deceased.

'Our thoughts are with the families of those who died, ISAF personnel, contractors, Afghan forces and civilians. We stand ready to provide the consular assistance needed to their families.'

The armoured personnel carrier, known as a Rhino, was travelling on a four-lane road frequently used by Nato forces in a south-western section of the city.

In addition to those killed in the convoy, three Afghan civilians and one policeman died as a result of the attack with eight other Afghans, including two children, wounded, officials said.

Many of the attacks in Kabul have been
blamed on the Haqqani network, an al Qaida and Taliban-linked movement 
that operates out of Pakistan.

The
confirmation of the dead Brits follows the announcement that 12 
Americans and a Canadian were killed on Saturday when a Taliban suicide 
bomber struck a coalition vehicle in Afghanistan’s capital.

Four U.S. troops and one Canadian solider died in the blast as well as eight American civilian contractors.

It
is the deadliest attack on the U.S.-led coalition in Kabul since the 
war began and is a major setback for the alliance as it begins to scale 
back combat troops.

It was initially thought that all five soldiers killed were Americans.

However,  a Canadian defense spokesperson, told The Associated Press that a Canadian soldier was among the troops killed.

The attack is thought to be the worst loss of American life in Afghanistan since 33 soldiers were killed in a helicopter crash on August 6.

The Taliban claimed responsibility for the attack, which also killed three Afghan civilians and one policeman.

Eight other Afghans, including two children and four other civilians, were wounded, said Kabir Amiri, head of Kabul hospitals.

The strike occurred near Darulaman Palace, the bombed-out seat of former Afghan kings on the southwest outskirts of the capital.

It was the deadliest of two attacks 
in the day that targeted either the U.S-led coalition or Afghan 
government offices in the country.

'Initial reports indicate that there 
has been a vehicle-borne IED attack today against a coalition vehicle in
Kabul,' Nato said in a statement, using military terminology for a car 
bomb.

The alliance said 'several' of its service members were among the casualties of the attack, but provided no other details.

The Taliban claim came shortly after the attack in a text message to media outlets.

Amid a new deadly attack that claimed the lives of 13 American in Afghanistan, a new report shows that a strong Taliban still remains.

The Pentagon said that militants can still pack a punch when it comes to launching attacks in the Afghan capital of Kabul.

The report, released Friday, said the Taliban-led insurgency remains 'adaptive and resilient' and with a 'regenerative capacity.'

In addition, the insurgency is enabled by safe havens in Pakistan.

The document maintains that the U.S. goal in Afghanistan is to fight off the Taliban and deny its ability to overthrow the Afghan government and to allow Afghanistan’s forces to take over the country’s security by 2014.

An Associated Press reporter on the scene said that Nato and Afghan forces had sealed off the area.

Two Nato helicopters landed to airlift casualties.

The back end of a Nato bus appeared to have been blown apart and was turned into a charred shell.

Earlier Saturday, a female suicide bomber blew herself up as she tried to attack a local government office in the capital of Kunar province, a hotbed of militancy in northeast Afghanistan along the Pakistan border.

Abdul Sabor Allayar, deputy provincial police chief, said the guards outside the government's intelligence office in Asad Abad became suspicious of the woman and started shooting, at which point she deonated her explosives.

Afghan and U.S.-led coalition forces 
conducted operations earlier this month, killing more than 100 
insurgents in an effort to curb violence in rugged areas of Kunar where 
the coalition and Afghan government have a light footprint.

Farther
south along the Afghanistan-Pakistan border, Afghan and coalition 
forces captured two leaders of the Haqqani network and two other 
suspected insurgents in Sarobi district of Paktika province, the 
coalition said.

Haqqani fighters, who are affiliated with the Taliban and Al-Qaida, are heavily rooted in Paktika and neighbouring Paktia and Khost provinces.

One of the captured leaders provided insurgent fighters with funding, weapons, supplies and hideouts, and the other coordinated attacks against Afghan forces, the coalition said.
