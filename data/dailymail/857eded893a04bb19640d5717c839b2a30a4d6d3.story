Protestors are planning to turn their backs on the funeral procession of former British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher on Wednesday. Pictured, British forces' officers carry a coffin outside St Paul's Cathedral during yesterday's rehearsal

Police were under pressure last night to crack down on plans to insult the memory of Margaret Thatcher at her funeral.

Hundreds of protesters have pledged to turn their backs on the former prime minister as her coffin travels through Central London.

Campaigners said Scotland Yard has effectively encouraged the move by decreeing it is not against the law and will not provoke arrests.

The move is calculated to cause maximum embarrassment to her grieving family without provoking action by police. It will be seen by millions of people worldwide as the huge ceremonial occasion is beamed live around the world on TV.

Police chiefs said they are ‘not there to uphold respect’ and said demonstrators who are merely ‘insulting’ are unlikely to face arrest.

But they faced a backlash from many who questioned why anyone would want to be so disrespectful to the dead stateswoman.

Hundreds of people have signed up to online sites vowing to wear red and turn their back on the military funeral cortege.

They want to occupy high-profile points of Lady Thatcher’s three mile funeral procession so their views will not be missed.

Organiser Rebecca Lush Blum, 41, of Warsash, Hampshire, said that by giving the green light police have encouraged others to join in.

The environmental campaigner said: ‘It is symbolic gesture that I turn my back on Thatcherism and all it stood for and I hope other people will join me.’

John Cooper, QC, the architect behind the back-turning protest, said the public nature of the funeral means it is impossible to ban insulting gestures.

He said: ‘Simply saying it is beastly, horrible or distasteful - a point of view that I can understand - does not take away the fact there will be a proportion of society that rightly wants to legally demonstrate.

‘Therefore what I am doing is trying to provide an outlet for people who so chose who want to demonstrate. I’m not saying they should or they shouldn’t, but for those that choose to there should be a legal way.

‘It might well be cathartic or therapeutic for some to do so and one legal way, and the police have agreed it is legal, is to turn your backs on the cortege.’

Scotland Yard refused to say how many groups have asked for permission to demonstrate during the funeral.

But several Facebook protest groups that sprung up since Lady Thatcher died have attracted a vocal and enthusiastic following.

One group, Maggie’s Good Riddance Party, threatens to hold a ‘right jolly knees-up’ outside St Paul’s Cathedral.

Retired chief constable Dr Tim Brain said police are forced to tread the fine line between the right to protest and upholding the law.

The retired Gloucestershire chief said shouting insults may even be tolerated as behaviour that is ‘insulting but not alarming or distressing’ may be allowed.

He said police will have the ‘human rights’ of protesters to ‘freedom of expression’ at the front of their minds.

Asked if shouting would be an offence, he replied: ‘It depends what is being shouted. That is the very fine judgment you have to make about policing in a democracy.’

Speaking on BBC Radio 4, he said police will be ‘very firm’ if protest becomes disruption, for example if objects are thrown at the procession.

Dr Brain said: ‘My expectation will be that when you move from peaceful protest into acts of disruption that is where the line will be crossed.’

Lord Tebbit, the former Conservative chairman, described protesters as ‘mindless bigots’ but said police have no option if they obey the law.

He said their actions will not provoke her supporters, adding: ‘Hopefully, those of us who admire Margaret Thatcher are too well-mannered to fall for the bait.’

Lady Thatcher’s former press secretary Sir Bernard Ingham accused police of ‘conniving at a display of bad taste.’

He said: ‘The plain fact is that we know exactly what these Left and anarchist groups do - they break convention and they enjoy doing it.

‘I’m absolutely certain there will be people who take great offence and are deeply upset by these protests because they don’t think it is the way to behave.’
