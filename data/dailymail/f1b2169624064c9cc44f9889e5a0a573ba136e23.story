Dishonest: Pathologist Dr Freddy Patel could now be struck off for his post mortem of G20 victim Ian Tomlinson

The pathologist who examined G20 protest victim Ian Tomlinson may now be struck off after making a string of almost 70 errors during his post mortem, a medical disciplinary panel has ruled.

Dr Freddy Patel was 'dishonest and misleading' when he found the newspaper vendor died of a heart attack after he had been hit by a police officer.

Today his medical tribunal identified 68 failings, including the key fact that Dr Patel did not tell police that 47-year-old Mr Tomlinson suffered injuries that could have been consistent with a baton strike.

Dr Patel’s fitness to practise was impaired, panel members said, and he acted with 'deficient professional performance' in his investigation when the father of nine was hit and pushed to the ground by Pc Simon Harwood during the G20 protest in the City of London in April 2009.

An inquest jury found that Mr Tomlinson had been unlawfully killed but Pc Harwood was later cleared of manslaughter.

Today the medical panel stated: 'The question of dishonesty is especially serious and the panel notes that you have previously been found to be dishonest in relation to your CV.

'Thus, the dishonesty found in Mr Tomlinson’s case is even more significant than it would otherwise have been.'

Dr Patel carried out the first post mortem examination into the death and claimed Mr Tomlinson had died of coronary artery disease.

The panel found that Dr Patel did not properly consider or comment on the fact that abdominal bleeding found on Mr Tomlinson could have caused his collapse and death.

Upset: Ian Tomlinson's son Paul King and Julia Tomlinson have been left distraught by his death and she said today Patel 'misled everyone'

They also found that the pathologist 
did not adequately explain how Mr Tomlinson could have died from a heart
attack or properly consider any other possible non-natural causes of 
his death.

After receiving new evidence, Dr Patel
compiled a second post-mortem report but again made a series of 
mistakes and incorrect conclusions, according to the panel.

Today the Medical Practitioners 
Tribunal Service, sitting in Manchester, highlighted how Dr Patel had 
already been criticised at two previous panels in the past two years.

It identified 68 failings in his handling of the Tomlinson case.

Drunk: PC Harwood believed Mr Tomlinson, left, who was drunk at the time, was being deliberately obstructive during the G20 protests in April 2009

Shove: Video footage shows Tomlinson being violently knocked to the ground

Fall: After being hit Tomlinson fell to the ground but got up, walked 75 yards before collapsing

Laid out: The 47-year-old later died in hospital from internal injuries

The police officer who was cleared of killing Ian Tomlinson during the G20 protests in London will face force disciplinary proceedings on September 17.

Pc Simon Harwood was acquitted of manslaughter last month, but police watchdog the Independent Police Complaints Commission (IPCC) ordered that he should face the internal Metropolitan Police hearing in public.

Scotland Yard confirmed that a gross misconduct hearing in front of a panel of three people including a senior officer and a lay person. It is expected to last up to four weeks.

Harwood told jurors at Southwark Crown Court that he had used only reasonable force, and was cleared of killing the father-of-nine. Jurors in an inquest into the death had earlier returned a verdict of unlawful killing.

The officer, 45, from Carshalton in Surrey, had a controversial disciplinary record before the fateful day when he came across Mr Tomlinson.

A series of allegations were made against him over a 12-year period, and he was allowed to retire from the Met on medical grounds in 2001 despite unresolved disciplinary proceedings.

Later, Harwood rejoined the force as a civilian worker, before becoming a police officer for Surrey. He was then allowed to rejoin the Met in 2004 as part of its Territorial Support Group, specialising in public order.

His original conclusions were challenged when video emerged of Pc Harwood, 45, pushing Mr Tomlinson to the ground.

Further
medical reports suggested that, in fact, he died from an injury to his 
liver that caused internal bleeding and then cardiac arrest.

The panel criticised Dr Patel, who is
suspended, for his 'closed mind set' in dealing with the case and said 
he had 'deficiencies in the areas of observation, interpretation ... and
in the conclusions you draw'.

They
found that Dr Patel had 'brought the profession into disrepute' and 
that his integrity could not be relied upon. He also breached one of the
'fundamental tenets of the profession' through his dishonesty.

Panel chairman the Rev Robert Lloyd-Richards said: 'It is clearly in the interest of the general public that they should be able to have confidence in the coronial system and this confidence has been undermined by your failures.

'Having considered everything before it the panel has determined that your fitness to practise... is impaired by reason of misconduct and deficient professional performance in the case of Mr Tomlinson.'

Mr Tomlinson’s widow Julia said today: 'The 
incompetence and dishonesty of Freddy Patel helped Pc Harwood and gave 
us an uphill battle for justice from the start.

'He misled everyone, saying that Ian had died of a heart attack when in fact he had died of internal bleeding.

'It’s good that people can see some of
the things we have been up against. Patel has a lot to answer for and I
would like to know why with all the good pathologists there are, he was
selected to do the first post mortem.'

Dr Patel’s fitness to practice has also been found impaired in relation to a number of other cases, including the death of a victim of the so-called 'Camden Ripper'.

He claimed that 31-year-old prostitute Sally White had died in 2002 from “natural causes” despite her injuries which included a bite mark and a head wound.

Other botched cases include those of a four-week-old baby, a five-year-old girl and an elderly lady.

The MPTS panel is now hearing submissions from the General Medical Council on what sanctions should be imposed on Dr Patel. They will also hear from his defence team before deciding whether he will be struck off.

Sorry we are unable to accept comments for legal reasons.
