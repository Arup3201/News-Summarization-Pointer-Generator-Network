Middlesbrough are lining up a move for Chelsea midfielder George Saville.

Wolves and Sheffield Wednesday have all expressed an interest in Saville, 21, but Middlesbrough are in pole position to land the player after holding talks with him on Monday.

Boro are managed by Jose Mourinho's former assistant at Real Madrid, Aitor Karanka, and have already taken Kenneth Omeruo on loan from Stamford Bridge this summer.

Potential: George Saville, left, is set to join Middlesbrough on loan for the 2014/15 season

Riverside: Chelsea youngster Nathan Chalobah spent time on loan at Middlesbrough during the last campaign

Blues youngster Nathaniel Chalobah also spent the second half of last season at the Riverside Stadium.

Saville played a key role in Brentford's promotion to the Championship last season while on loan at Griffin Park.

Meanwhile, West Brom are interested in Middlesbrough midfielder Albert Adomah.
