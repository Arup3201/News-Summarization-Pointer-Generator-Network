A young father who died in a paragliding accident on Monday afternoon posted pictures of his view from the sky just hours before he lost control of his powered paramotor.

Kyle Wittstock, 22, posted photos from the air with the caption 'Guess where I am?', showing the beach and water far below his dangling feet.

The paraglider was swept into a garage door of a house on Linksman Street in Yanchep, Perth, by a strong wind at approximately 3.30pm on Monday afternoon.
