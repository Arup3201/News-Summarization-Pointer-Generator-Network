The three pitch invaders who disrupted Tottenham's Europa League match with Partizan Belgrade on Thursday night are serial pranksters whose videos on YouTube and social media have gone viral across the world.

Gomes Garcia, Nathan Brown and Dan Jarvis are part of TrollStation, whose previous pranks include turning a Tube carriage into a strip club and faking a kidnapping.

All three are still in custody after being arrested following their pitch incursions, the Metropolitan Police confirmed. They added that enquiries are ongoing, with one of the three also arrested for handling stolen goods.

YouTube, which recently gave the group an award  for attracting 100,000 subscribers to their channel, are yet to take any action against the group.

The trio ran on to the pitch during the first-half of the Europa League match, attempting to take selfies with the Tottenham players and evading stewards who tried to catch them.

After the third pitch invasion, referee Yevgen Aranovsky led the players into the tunnel for several minutes on safety grounds.

They wore white, long-sleeved T-shirts bearing the logo of audio manufcanturers BassBuds, who sell official branded headphones through Tottenham's merchandise store.

BassBuds issued a statement condemning their actions and denying any involvement in the incidents, stating: 'We want to confirm that BassBuds PR did not authorise Troll Station to invade/interrupt the Tottenham game and wear our merchandise for "Pranks" of this sort.

'We have worked with Troll Station before and have previously agreed to them giving away our BassBuds FC merchandise including speakers, whistles, earphones, and T-shirts branded with BassBuds FC writing for competitions and in street promotions.

'As you can imagine, we are very disappointed that our product was in any way associated with what they did and we are distressed.

'We would like to confirm we have never been in a contractual agreement with Troll Station. We have terminated our relationship with these irresponsible people, for the unauthorised events of last night (Thursday).' 

Despite this, Spurs severed links with the company after the stunt and could well take legal action if they are found to have links to it.

UEFA confirmed on Friday afternoon that they have opened disciplinary proceedings against Tottenham. 

The TrollStation video, uploaded to YouTube late on Thursday night, starts with Gomes introducing the prank and his fellow pitch invaders 'Nathan' and 'Jarvis'.

He says: 'Today we're going to see who lasts longer on the pitch.'

The three pitch invasions are then filmed from the stands, in breach of the ticket terms.

Nathan is the first to run on to the pitch, making his way past Jan Vertonghen before stopping to pose for a selfie with a frustrated Kyle Naughton.

He then runs past Benjamin Stambouli before  the orange-vested stewards catch him as the crowd egg him on.

A tweet by the Metropolitan Police confirmed the arrest of the three pitch invaders - they added that one of the three was also arrested for handling stolen goods

BassBuds, a sponsor linked with Spurs, denied they had anything to do with the incident

TrollStation also posted a video on their YouTube where they set up a 'strip club' on the London Underground

Gomes is the second prankster to run on to the field, evading security all too easily. He has his shirt pulled off by Roberto Soldado but continues bare-chested before being dragged to the ground by stewards.

Dan Jarvis, the third to run on, sends a steward flying as he climbs over the sponsor boards but is wrestled to the ground by Mousa Dembele. It is at this point the referee leads the players off.

In a statement published on their website, Tottenham confirmed: 'Three pitch invaders at tonight's match have been arrested and are assisting police with their enquiries.

'We apologise to fans for the disruptions caused by this totally unacceptable behaviour.'

The match, which eventually finish 1-0 to the hosts, was suspended after the events

One of the men who ran onto the pitch was tweeting about it on Wednesday evening

'Tonight my cojones will be put to the test,' he wrote, hours before disrupting the game at White Hart Lane

The match resumed after a short delay and Tottenham won 1-0, sealing their passage to the knockout stage of the competition.

The TrollStation Twitter account posted about the prank on Friday morning, calling for the trio to be released from custody.

The Metropolitan Police confirmed to Sportsmail that the three men were arrested at the match and remained in custody.

Another tweet suggested a repeat performance, saying: 'The questions is Emirates Stadium or Stamford Bridge?'

They had hinted a prank was imminent ahead of the event, with Gomes Garcia tweeting on Thursday afternoon: 'Tonight my cojones will be put to the test.'

They even apologised to BassBuds in one tweet afterwards, saying they 'had to do it... we support Arsenal'. 

The trio have gained a large online following for their pranks, racking up thousands of YouTube views.

A prank last month, which saw them seal off part of a London Underground carriage as a strip dancing club, attracted over 200,000 views on YouTube. 

Free lap dances were offered to passangers travelling on a Northern Line train through central London with the 'strip club' coming complete with bouncers and a velvet rope.

Another prank saw Nathan dancing wildly to techno track 'Sandstorm' by Darude on an Underground platform as unimpressed commuters watched on in bemusement.

They also ambushed Russell Brand at one of his recent protests and hid in the changing rooms at a Kent leisure centre so they could ride the flumes after it closed.

They also faked kidnappings in a supermarket, a mobile phone shop and a bus stop, complete with 'gangsters' in black balaclavas and hoodies, who bundled the 'victim' into the boot of a car. 

Dan Jarvis posted a video on his Facebook page after staying in a leisure centre after hours last month
