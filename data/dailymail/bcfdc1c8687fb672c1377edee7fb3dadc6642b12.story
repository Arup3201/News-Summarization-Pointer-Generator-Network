Belgian police have threatened to arrest British border staff stopping illegal migrants taking Eurostar trains to London.

Dozens of migrants are thought to exploit the so-called ‘Lille Loophole’ every day.

They buy a Eurostar ticket from Brussels to Lille, allowing them to avoid the UK border checks in the Belgian capital.

Loophole: Passengers can miss key border checks by buying a ticket from Brussels to Lille but then stay on until London

And when the train stops in Lille they 
simply stay on board and carry on through the Channel Tunnel to London, 
where passports are rarely checked.

Internal border agency figures suggest use of the loophole has shot up 
in recent months.

The Belgian authorities insist Britain cannot 
interrogate Eurostar passengers with tickets to France because both 
countries are inside the European Union’s Schengen area of free 
movement.

Hiding under a Eurostar train is one way of getting into Britain – as is trying to sneak into the back of a lorry.

But both are dangerous and far from certain to succeed – unlike the ‘Lille loophole’.

Illegal migrants must first buy a ticket – often for as little as £23 –from Brussels in Belgium to Lille in France.

Crucially, this ticket allows them to bypass the British border controls at the Eurostar terminal in Brussels, which are designed for those with tickets to London.

Instead the migrants walk down the passport-free lane for Lille passengers – where only their ticket is checked.

When the train gets to Lille, they stay on board and complete the journey to London.

Some buy a second ticket covering the final leg of their trip so they do not fall foul of ticket inspectors.

Brussels police say stopping passengers with tickets to Lille, even those thought to be headed for London, breaches the Schengen agreement on free movement.

One of the UK 
officials told BBC Radio 4’s The Report that a Belgian officer shouted 
at him: ‘This has got to stop.

You are not in Britain now, you are in 
Schengen. If they make a complaint you will be arrested.’

The threats mean British officials may now have to turn a blind eye to suspected illegal migrants.

In the first six months of this year, officers caught 80 migrants using 
the loophole to get into the  country.

But in the following five months 
that number increased to 240. Last year just 14 migrants were caught on 
the route.

As the figures show only those who are detected by the Border Agency, the true figure is likely to be much higher.

Border Agency sources said there were fears the loophole could be 
exploited by terrorists and people traffickers.

One said it was not 
unusual to see up to 20 suspect passengers on a Eurostar train.

Another officer even claimed Belgian police had been known to use the loophole to clear migrants from the streets of Brussels.

Immigration minister Damian Green said: ‘We are working closely with our
Belgian counterparts and Eurostar to resolve this as quickly as 
possible.’

A spokesman for the Belgian government did not respond to requests for a comment.
