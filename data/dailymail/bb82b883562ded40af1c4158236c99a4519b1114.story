A newly opened gluten-free schnitzel eatery in an Adelaide food court has offended customers with their 'racist' menu.

Schnityz City-Cross offers an Asian style 'yellow fever' dish, 'Ranga, Gingers have souls' and 'Kunst, German word for art'.

Customers have gone as far as urging others to boycott the fast-food store on social media.

Customers have labelled the new menu at Schnityz City-Cross as 'racist' and 'offensive'

Owner Tim Fitzpatrick says 'it won't be necessary' to change the menu at the store

'Disappointed that you would feature such racist/offensive menu items. I won't be trying and will be letting others know,' Anika Johnstone wrote on Facebook.

Kathy Hall was looking forward to the store opening until she saw the menu.

'It is racist and offensive,' she wrote.

Andrew Coulson wasn't impressed.

'Nice bit of racism going on in Adelaide...avoid,' he wrote.

Jones Vanessa also wrote: 'Not clever or funny in the slightest.'

However owner Tim Fitzpatrick says the menu was designed in good humour.

The fast-food store officially began trading on Wednesday

'It's a bit of tongue-in-cheek fun,' he told Daily Mail Australia.

'The aim was to make our menu mainstream and commercial with these names which also came as suggestions from staff.'

Mr Fitzpatrick denies being racist and says the label couldn't be further from the truth.

'Our team come from different nationalities including our manager who's Dutch, our head chef who's Indian and our kitchen hand from Italy and France,' he said.

He added other staff members are from Sri Lanka and Africa.

'Most people have found the menu hilarious and have been pretty nonchalant about it,' Mr Fitzpatrick said.

'The negative response has been very limited so I don't think it'll be necessary to change the menu.'
