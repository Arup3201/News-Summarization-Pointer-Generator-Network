Pippa Middleton today made her 2012 debut in the Wimbledon royal box as she arrived to watch the day's action on Centre Court.

Neat in a navy Orla Kiely dress and buttoned-up macrame jacket, the Duchess of Cambridge's younger sister took her seat in the box with her brother James to watch Andy Murray battle for his place in the third round.

Pippa, 28, a keen tennis fan, sat alongside Felicity Kendal and her son Jake Rudman, and the three soon struck up conversation.

The Middletons, who attracted a flurry of attention as they entered the grounds earlier today, had clearly made an effort to put across a polished appearance in the hallowed royal box.

Pippa is a member of the Queen's Tennis Club and a regular face at the tournament.

Last year she attended with her ex-boyfriend, Alex Louden and her parents Michael and Carole, all of whom watched the action from the royal box.

This year, Carole Middleton also attended - she watched Roger Federer take on Fabio Fognini on Centre Court yesterday.

Unlike last year, Mrs Middleton did not sit in the royal box, where 
Prince Charles and the Duchess of Cornwall were joined by Bruce Forsyth 
and his wife Wilnelia.

Instead, she joined the general public in the stands.

Among the other guests in the royal box today was actress Felicity Kendal.

Pippa today wore a navy and white macrame jacket by Irish designer Orla Kiely, a designer she has chosen before - namely for her appearance at the Thames pageant, when she wore the same navy blue dress she wore today with another Orla Kiely jacket on top.

Orla Kiely is a designer frequently chosen by the Duchess of Cambridge too, who wore a green Orla Kiely coat-dress on St Patrick's Day, and chose a brown dress for one of her public appearances during the Jubilee tour of Britain.

Pippa's Orla Kiely macrame jacket, which was initially £265, is currently on sale for £132.50

Pippa's sunglasses are Givenchy's Obsedia, available from Harvey Nichols at £159

FASHION VERDICT BY NICOLE MOWBRAY, EDITOR OF LIFE & STYLE

Ascot wasn’t alone in launching a new dress code to keep out the scruffs this year.

Wimbledon too has issued stricter rules about acceptable clothing in a bid to raise the sartorial standards of spectators.

But it seems Pippa took the smart style dictat rather too literally on Centre Court today.

Her buttoned-up formal look is not only way too old for her 28 years, but it’s also rather climate inappropriate - the temperature on Centre Court is expected to reach a whopping 28 degrees this afternoon; not really the weather for a knitted jacket. 

This new demure Pippa has been seen several times since the debacle in Paris where her friend pointed a gun at photographers.

She wore the same rather frumpy Orla Kiely ensemble at the Jubilee river pageant earlier this month.

Let’s not even talk about her sandals.

This is the first public outing of the ‘Middleton wedge’ this summer, but don’t expect it to be the last.

All the Middleton women wear the open-toed wedge style so often during the warm months they almost have to be surgically removed by the time autumn comes around.
