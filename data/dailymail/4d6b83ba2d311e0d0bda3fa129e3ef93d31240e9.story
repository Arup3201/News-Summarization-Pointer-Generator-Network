David Barrow has been jailed for four-and-a-half years for repeatedly stabbing Jason Earle in Bristol, who was having an affair with his wife of 19 years 

A jilted husband repeatedly stabbed his wife's lover in front of crowds in a shopping centre after she told him his love rival was better in the bedroom.

David Barrow, 46, had followed Nicolette Barrow, his wife of 19 years, to a secret rendez-vous with her lover Jason Earle at a shopping centre in Bristol. 

He confronted the pair and was about to walk away when Mrs Barrow said 'He's better in bed that you, deal with it.' 

Barrow then repeatedly stabbed Mr Earle, causing damage to his liver.

Onlookers at the busy shopping centre in Cribbs Causeway said Barrow appeared to be punching Mr Earle and to have forgotten he had the knife in his hand. After the attack he was seen repeatedly headbutting a wall.

At a hearing at Bristol Crown Court, Barrow, who has two teenage children with his wife, was jailed for four-and-a-half years after he admitted wounding with intent to cause grievous bodily harm. 

The court heard the Barrows had been married for 19 years when Mrs Barrow, 43, met Mr Earle over the internet and the pair started an affair. They met in secret, sometimes even at the family home in Patchway in Bristol. 

Peter Coombe, prosecuting, said on one occasion the Barrows, Mr Earle and his wife met at Strensham services on the M5 in Worcestershire to discuss what had been going on. 

During this meeting Barrow said to Mr Earle: 'It's a good job this wasn't two hours ago.

'I would be banged up by now because I had a knife.

'If I found you in my house you'd have been dead. I know everything about you. I know where you live.' 

The Barrows decided to go to marriage counselling and Mrs Barrow agreed not to see Mr Earle while she and her husband tried to repair their marriage.

But the affair continued. 

Barrow found out and bought a satnav and block of knives as he planned to warn off his wife's lover.  

He hired a car and on July 12 drove to Mr Earle's home in Malvern, Worcestershire, to confront him.

Barrow lunged at Mr Earle in The Mall shopping Centre in Bristol in July when it was busy with shoppers 

But he changed his mind on the way and began to make his way back to Bristol, the court heard. As he drove home along M5 he saw Mr Earle's van overtake him and he decided to change course again and follow him. 

Barrow called his wife to ask where she was and found he was at The Mall shopping centre at Cribbs Causeway, Bristol  - where Mr Earle was also heading.

When the trio arrived at the busy shopping centre Barrow confronted Mr Earle who admitted he was meeting Mrs Barrow.

Barrow phoned his wife and she joined the two men before they each 'exchanged words'.

He was just about to walk away when his wife insulted his prowess in the bedroom and he attacked Mr Earle.

Barrow lunged at his wife's lover outside a Marks and Spencer store and plunged the knife into him. Some of the wounds were so deep his liver was injured and blood was found in his lungs. 

Mr Earle was given life-saving treatment by a number of firefighters who were doing a charity event at the shopping centre before police and paramedics arrived. 

Ian Kelcey, mitigating, said: 'This is a truly tragic case.

'Clearly this was an act completely out of character for this man, a man with no previous convictions who had led a blameless life.

'He had been a hard worker within a major institution within this city, where he had been positively vetted to a high degree.

'He was a family man, dedicated to his children and his wife. He had been told a tissue of lies. He was desperate to save his marriage and his family life with his children.'

Mr Kelcey added: 'This [the comment about his bedroom prowess] really was what broke this man on that fateful Saturday morning.

'He has lost everything that he strived for throughout the years. In short, he is a broken man who appears before you today.'

As well as the prison sentence, a three-year restraining order was imposed.
