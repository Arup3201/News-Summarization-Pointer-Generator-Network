Gareth Bale was always going to be Wales' most dangerous threat going forward but it was the Real Madrid superstar's tenacity at the back that said it all for proud coach Chris Coleman.

Forward Bale scrambled to clear a ball from the line at the death as Wales stayed at the top of Group B and maintain their undefeated record so far in Euro 2016 qualifying. 

'That epitomises every thing about us at the moment,' said Coleman. 'Baley back there kicking it off the line. Usually we're talking about him at the other end but we all have to put a shift in.'

As a whole, Coleman said 0-0 was 'an incredible performance from our lads'.

'It wasn't pretty at times but who cares? It's about points,' he said.

'We learnt from the last campaign where we played some much better football, we had a lot of chances, we kept getting beat too much. (It was) Too easy when we didn't have the ball but we're a much tougher outfit now.

'That's two clean sheets in four games. Two clean sheets against the two top teams, Bosnia and Belgium, so we're on the right path, that's for sure.'

'We're up against an incredible offensive, aggressive team, they don't come much tougher than that. It's been labelled the best Belgium team ever so to come here and take a point it speaks volumes for our players.

'The lads, they showed so much character, courageous at times.

'That attitude and we've had it for some time now where we're always in the game even if the opposition are on top of us. We don't buckle, we don't duck it and we don't hide from the challenge. We stand our ground.'

The man himself, Bale, said his work rate getting forward and back was all part of this Wales team's make up dubbing the draw a 'fantastic' result.

'To get any result was a fantastic performance from us,' Bale said. 'We'll take the point.

'We started a bit slow in the first half but the football we played in the second half we showed true courage, true character and to get a point is massive for us.'

'We put expectation on ourselves more than anyone and we know what we're capable of.

'It was great to get a point, we showed a good performance for the fans.'

On his own defensive heroics, Bale said: 'You have to do those things. We all work for each other.' 

Coleman admitted his heart was in his mouth a number of times, as the likes of Chelsea's Eden Hazard consistently threatened but his side showed steel in defence.

'Offensively they're an aggressive team, they don't come much tougher than that,' he said. 

'We said we're going to have to ride our luck a bit.

Wales captain Ashley Williams, keeping tight on Nacer Chadli, said a point and a clean sheet is 'massive'

'[Wales] showed so much character and were courageous at times. When teams are on top of us we don't buckle.' 

Captain Ashley Williams hailed the 0-0 finish among the best performances he has ever been involved with in international football.

'One of the best performances I've seen at least in my time with Wales as a team,' he said. 

'Everyone really stuck to the cause. It wasn't too pretty in the first half but we dug in.

'To come here and get a point and a clean sheet is massive for us. It keeps our momentum in the group, we haven't lost yet.

'We wanted to win the game but we will definitely take a point.'
