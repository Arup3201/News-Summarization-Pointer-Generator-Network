A man who spent his vacation giving away $50 and $100 to dozens of need Canadians last week has been tossed into a mental institution.

After certain recipients of Richard Wright's rare generosity decided the Prince Edward Island man could be mentally ill, they called authorities Thursday and Wright was hauled away for evaluation.

Now his daughter has started an online campaign to get her father out of the institution and claims he's perfectly sane and just wanted to share 'some extra money.'

Unfair? Prince Edward Island man Richard Wright was tossed into a psych ward on Thursday not long after dozens of reports emerged that he was giving away hundreds of dollars to dozens of strangers last week

Wants her dad back: Wright's daughter has taken to Facebook to raise awareness of her dad's detainment, which she says is unfair and unnecessary

'He did nothing illegal, he was simply helping some people out. Since when did being a nice person make you end up in the hospital,' wrote Chelsey Wright on the Facebook page she created, #OpFreeRichardWright.'

Richard's troubles began while he was vacationing with family in Halifax.

Dozens of people started taking to social media to report a mystery man who gave them $50, $100 and in some cases valuable silver bullion coins simply because he wanted to help them out.

Chelsey told Metro News that he saved up for a long time for his charity spree.

But that didn't seem to matter after reports came that the modern day Robin Hood spreading the wealth around town may have been mentally ill.

'They think he is sick and has mental 
issues,' Chelsey wrote on Sunday. 'I know he does not. He plans to 
hopefully attain legal help tomorrow.

'We
 are keeping our fingers crossed. My dad is honestly a great guy. He has
 always been good to people, and he simply just wanted to help people 
out.'

Since she created #OpFreeRichardWright, over 3,000 people have joined the group and more are joining all the time.

Among his supporters are the people Wright helped along the way, including

Jennifer
 Corbett, who received $150 and a promise that 'things will get better' 
from Wright. She even called him at the psych ward in Charlottetown to 
wish him well.

'I don’t 
think it’s fair that this happened,' Corbett told Metro. 'I mean do you 
think that people are going to want to do good after this?'

Authorities won't comment on Wright's case for privacy reasons, but health officials said in a release:

'A patient is always admitted at the clinical recommendation of a physician who has met with and assessed the patient.'

Among the grateful recipients of Wright's kindness were Bill McNamara and June Bond, who received two $50 bills and two valuable silver bullion coins (held by Abigail, 3). Recipients like them have become strong supporters of Wright's
