Trainspotting isn't usually regarded as a dangerous hobby.

But a young Chinese train enthusiast was lucky not be killed when he was frazzled by high-voltage wires as he stood on top of a locomotive while posing for pictures. 

Lin Ho, 21, and a group of friends had gone to the station in the city of Fuzhou in south-eastern China's Fujian province to take photos of trains, according to The People's Daily Online.

Horrific: Lin Ho, 21, and a group of friends had gone to the station in Fuxhou to take photos of trains

Accident: But when Ho climbed up on top of the train, he touched the wires - turning him into a fireball

But after clambering up onto one engine Ho, from Putian, was seen to reach up and touch the overhead wires,  sending 35,000 volts ripping through his body.

Horrified pal Shi Tao, 22, said: 'One minute he was laughing and excited and the next he erupted into a ball of fire and was thrown right off the top of the roof.

'We ran over but he was burning and we couldn't get close so we began screaming for help.'

Another witness told Fujian Southeast Network he watched three men climb up onto the roof.

Xiao Yibo told the network: 'I see one of the men suddenly raised his arm but he did not actually touched the wires above his head.'

He said the next moment there was a loud bang, and the man caught fire and fell down.  

Mr Xiao yelled at the two friends, who appeared to be in shock, to get off the train as soon as possible.

'Someone fetched a fire extinguisher and put out the fire on the man,' said Mr Xiao.

Ho was then rushed to hospital, where he was treated in a special burns unit.

A hospital spokesman said: 'More than 80 percent of his body is severely burnt and although he is still alive he is by no means out of danger yet. 

'Even if he recovers, electricity has done horrific damage to his body.

'He is being closely monitored.'

Not out of danger: Ho was rushed to hospital, but suffered 80 per cent burns to his body

A spokesman for the railway station said the cargo trains which passed through were popular with locals, who visit to take pictures.

It is reported even newly married couples visit the station for photos, and many climb on the trains' roofs to get better shots. 

However, the spokesman was clear they try to discourage people from wandering onto the area where the trains are kept.

'But there are some, including children, who sneak into the area to play despite the fact we make it quite clear it isn't allowed,' he added.
