Newcastle has been chosen to host the 2015 Magic Weekend, when a full round of fixtures in the First Utility Super League are played over two days on the same pitch.

The Rugby Football League was forced to look for a new venue after being told that Manchester City's Etihad Stadium was not available next May due to building work.

Coventry, which will host semi-professional rugby league from 2015, was thought to be under consideration but Super League bosses have opted for Newcastle United's St James' Park, which will host three matches on Saturday, May 30 and three the following day, at its 52,404-capacity home.

Magic Weekend was first staged in Cardiff in 2007 and has also been held in Edinburgh as well as Manchester, which is favourite to regain the event from 2016 when it will have a new capacity.

Super League general manager Blake Solly said: 'St James' Park is one of Britain's iconic sporting stadiums and Newcastle is a fantastic destination city that will provide the perfect backdrop to the First Utility Super League Magic Weekend.

'We did receive interest in staging Magic Weekend from a number of other venues but none provided as good a fit as Newcastle for many reasons, including its transport links, hotel and accommodation options and opportunities for our fans to enjoy a weekend to remember.'

Super League was played in the north-east in 1999 when Gateshead Thunder entered the competition after the International Stadium had previously hosted an 'on-the-road' match between Leeds and Salford.

Thunder merged with Hull after only 12 months and moved to east Yorkshire but Gateshead re-formed as a Championship club and, after being recently taken over by Newcastle Falcons, will stage a play-off tie as part of a double-header with the rugby union club at Kingston Park on Sunday.

Sean Bullick, chief executive of NE1 Ltd, said: 'NE1 is delighted to be hosting Magic Weekend and to be welcoming rugby league teams and fans to Newcastle.

'Large-scale events like this do a fantastic job of promoting Newcastle and the wider region. I'm sure visiting fans will have a fantastic time in the city and we hope this will be the best Magic Weekend so far.'

Councillor Nick Forbes, leader of Newcastle City Council, said: 'Newcastle has a proven track record of hosting large-scale sporting events.

'With so much to do here and our famous hospitality, visitors are guaranteed a fantastic experience and a taste of Geordie Magic.'

The league say the fixtures and kick-off times will be confirmed in mid-November. There will be one fewer fixture than this year due to the re-structuring and relegation of Bradford and London Broncos.
