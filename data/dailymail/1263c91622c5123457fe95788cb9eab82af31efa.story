Tyson Fury has apologised following a foul-mouthed tirade aimed at Dereck Chisora ahead of their heavyweight showdown.

Fury is set to face Chisora on July 26 in Manchester but, in a press conference ahead of the bout, descended into using foul language as he set up a bet with his opponent on Monday.

Fury took to Twitter to say sorry to those offended, where he said: 'I apologise for my ungodly actions @ the press Recently with @dellboychisora there was no bad feelings or Intentions. Just a show,#forgiveme.

Let's shake on it: Dereck Chisora and Tyson Fury go head-to-head as they shake hands on a side-bet

Controversial: The press conference was marred by Fury's bad language which he has now apologised for

'Boxing has been good to me it has brought me Security,Health,&kept me out of trouble, I thank every1 who has been Involved in my career. Xxx'

Opponent Chisora had already tried to excuse Fury's behaviour, which only led to an angry reply.

'I don't give a f*** how many women and children are in the audience, Fury said. 'We're getting near to the fight and I'm in fight mode, kill mode.'

Promoter Frank Warren, who is also Chisora's manager, has been going to considerable lengths to sell the July 26 spectacle in Manchester at a time when the run-up to this rematch has been overshadowed by the World Cup finals.

The two had shook hands in the press conference on a wager where the winner could receive £100,000.
