Emotional: Victoria Pendleton weeps as she proudly displays her gold medal

There were tears of joy yesterday as Britain's female athletes led the rush for Olympic glory.

Cyclist Victoria Pendleton – ‘Queen Victoria’ – wept after winning gold in the keirin track event just 24 hours after the heartbreak of being disqualified in the team sprint.

Earlier on a magnificent day, rowers Katherine Grainger and Anna Watkins powered to a thrilling victory on the waters of Eton Dorney.

Pendleton, 31, said last night: ‘I 
don’t know if it was a bit bold, but I said about a year ago it's going 
to be an Olympics for the girls.'

For Grainger, 36, the victory in the women's double sculls was especially sweet after winning silver in the last three Olympics.

She said: 'It was worth the wait.' Prince William described her win as 'absolutely staggering.'

Today
Jessica Ennis goes for gold in the heptathlon after a inspirational 
start with a stunning victory in the 110m hurdles, while the  British
cycling  trio of Joanna Rowsell, Laura Trott and Dani King are favourites to win
the team pursuit gold at a packed velodrome.

There was disappointment for swimmer 
Rebecca Adlington who failed to defend her 800m freestyle title, but still picked up a bronze. That medal was matched by British judoka Karina Bryant's third-place finish in the women's 78kg+ category.

The
men did their bit too when cyclists Ed Clancy, Geraint Thomas, Steven 
Burke and Peter Kennaugh won gold in the team pursuit smashing the world
record as they beat Australia.

Alan
Campbell cried after winning bronze in the men's single sculls and George Nash and William Satch also took bronze in the men's pair. Andy Murray was guaranteed at least a silver by beating Novak Djokovic 
in straight sets to reach the men's tennis final where he will meet Roger 
Federer.

After her victory, Pendleton told how 
she searched the crowd for her fiancé  Scott Gardner. They finally kissed
in front of 6,000 fans in an emotional scene.

She said: ' I was searching for him 
desperately in the crowd. I didn't know where he was... I am so glad I 
found him.' Their relationship has caused controversy because he was on 
the staff of the cycling team and such liaisons were frowned on.

But
the fallout was forgotten as Pendleton powered home to golden glory. 
She said: 'I can barely believe it. The crowd have been fantastic - they
really helped me tonight.'

After three consecutive silver medals
Grainger had feared she would always be the bridesmaid at the Games, 
but she put those days behind her, raising her arms to the heavens as 
she crossed the line and bowed to a packed stand.

The scene could not have been further
removed from the devastating defeat in Beijing four years ago when she missed out on gold. Then, she was left distraught and contemplating retirement.

She told the BBC: 'It was worth the 
wait. I feel this medal, of all of them, is the people's medal. I feel 
so many people have been behind me and supported me and wanted this for 
me as much as I have.'

An exhausted Adlington apologised to the crowd for not winning but described her bronze as 'unbelievable'.

'I hope that people will still be proud of me,'she said. 'I don't  know what happened. I gave it everything and did my best.'

She was beaten by 15-year-old 
American sensation Katie Ledecky. Adlington, who had been willed on by 
deafening screams from the home crowd, hugged her teenage rival after 
the race.

The Olympic aquatics centre was filled with roars as the Briton entered, with screams and cheers continuing as the race began.

Throughout, the crowds chanted: 'Come on Becky' and 'Becky, Becky' as the 23-year-old battled to defend her title.

The Duke of Cambridge and Prince Harry were among the crowds willing Adlington to repeat her Beijing victory. Even
after defeat, the partisan crowd cheered for Adlington, who waved 
gratefully to her supporters as she left the pool. Adlington had taken 
bronze in the 400m freestyle on Wednesday.

And while there was no gold medal from the race, Britons remain staunch supporters of the Mansfield-born swimmer.Lee Cullinane, 48, from London, said: 'Well it's slightly disappointing, but I say good for her.

'That's a marvellous achievement, third best in the world is a pretty good place to be.'

Carrie Power, 24, a mechanic in the army, came with a special home-made Union flag, and her face painted.

'I think it's fantastic,' she said. 'She has done the country so proud, I feel so privileged to be here and supporting her.I loved the chanting, people really made an effort and the atmosphere's amazing.

'She's done brilliantly, what an amazing experience.'

The victories took the number of of Team
GB golds in the first week of London 21012 to eight and the overall 
total of medals to 22 with six silver and eight bronze. This 12 better than at the same stage in Beijing four years ago  and puts Britain in fourth place behind China, the U.S. and South Korea.

Thousands of people crowded in to Hyde Park today to watch Helen Jenkins try to boost Britain's gold medal collection in the women's triathlon.Crowds around the Serpentine were ten deep in some places to watch the start of the race.

Jenkins has previously said she was hoping similar crowds to the ones that roared Bradley Wiggins on to Olympic gold on Wednesday will help her stand on top of the triathlon podium.

The 27-year-old from Bridgend goes into the race as the reigning world champion and a dominant winner of the test event in Hyde Park 12 months ago.Triathlon is one of the few events that is mainly non-ticketed, where crowds can line the route to cheer on the British team.

Joanne and James White travelled from Leeds to London for Olympic events this weekend and decided to get up early to watch Jenkins' bid for a gold medal.

Mrs White, 29, said: 'The atmosphere is amazing. We saw the crowds for Bradley Wiggins and Lizzie Armitstead and wanted to experience it for ourselves.

'We're really hoping we get to see Team GB get another gold. It's so exciting.'
