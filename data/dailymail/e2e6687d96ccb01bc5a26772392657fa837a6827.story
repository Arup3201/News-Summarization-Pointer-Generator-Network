Support: Archbishop Dr Barry Gordon said it made 'no theological sense' to oppose women bishops

Women will be allowed to become bishops in Wales’ Anglican churches following a landmark vote that will surely put pressure on the Church of England to follow suit.

Members
of the Church in Wales’ 144-strong governing body voted through the 
proposals at a meeting in Lampeter, near Cerdigan in west Wales, earlier today.

Supporters and women’s rights groups called the decision long overdue, arguing the exclusion of women from the top roles made the church less relevant in modern society.

Wales has now joined Scotland and Northern Ireland in opening their doors to the ordination of women bishops, leaving just the Church of England opposed to the idea.

The issue was hotly debated at the Church of Wales’ governing body meeting in the University of St David.

The vote needed a two thirds majority from three of the Church in Wales’ 'houses' - Laity, Clergy and Bishops.

Laity voted 57 for and 14 against, with Clergy backing the move 37 to 10. Bishops’ vote was unanimously in favour of the plan.

Archbishop of Wales, Dr Barry Morgan, said it made 'no theological sense' to continue opposing the ordination of women as bishops when the church already ordained them as deacons and priests.

It is the second time in five years it had faced the issue. A previous proposal was defeated in 2008 by just three votes.

The Bill was proposed by the six diocesan bishops of the Church in Wales.

Canon Patrick Thomas of Christ Church, Carmarthen, said: 'I’m happy with Bishop Wyn but would be just as happy with Bishop Wynona.'

Nigel King, stewardship officer for the Diocese of Swansea and Brecon, added: 'Do we really care whether the bishop has external or internal plumbing?'

Canon Jenny Wigley, from Radyr, Cardiff, said the Bible itself says there should be no differences between people.

'It’s Christ-like people that the church chooses as bishops and I hope and pray that the Church in Wales gives an unqualified and unreserved yes to the Christ-like qualities of our women priests alongside our men,' she added.

However, Father Ben Andrews, from Barry, said it could be difficult for some people to stay in the church if women bishops were allowed.

He said: 'The bishop’s role is to hold the diocese together, and for those of us who in good conscience cannot accept the sacramental ministry of a woman bishop means we cannot be in communion with that bishop.

'We are told we have an honoured place within the church but that place is going to be difficult if not impossible for us to stay and remain.

Christ-like: Cannon Jenny Wigley argued there were no differences between people in the Bible

'There may come a time when it is impossible for me to function as a priest in the Church in Wales.'

Dr Elliott King, Swansea and Brecon, said the church should not feel it has to do what secular society says.

However, unlike democratic political elections, the Church in Wales takes all views into account in making its decisions.

And one contentious microcosm of debate was what level of protection should be afforded to those who fiercely objected to the plans.

Calls had been made for changes to the Church in Wales’ constitution for priests who did not want to be led by a woman, which would have prompted a second vote at a later date.

Some argued that allowing greater room for objectors by going to a second vote later in the year could avert a division opening up in the church.

However, those in favour of going to a straight yes/no vote - where any decision would come into effect within one year - said the matter needed to be resolved now.

Passionate: Archbishop of Canterbury Justin Welby is in favour of women bishops

The decision to allow women to be ordained as bishops in the Church of England was narrowly defeated last year.

The matter went before the Church of England's General Synod's governing body in November.

Despite it being approved by the House of Bishops and House of Clergy, the proposition was rejected by the General Synod's House of Laity.

As with the Church in Wales, each house needed a two thirds majority in favour for the vote to be approved. In the House of Laity, 74 voted against with 132 in for.

Had another six members voted in favour, the motion would have been passed.

Archbishop of Canterbury the Rt Reverand Justin Welby is firmly in favour of the ordination of women bishops and had been looking at dissolving the General Synod and holding fresh elections.

But In July the General Synod voted in favour of looking at the matter again by 319 votes to 84.

The General Synod is unlikely to vote on the matter again until 2015 at the earliest.
