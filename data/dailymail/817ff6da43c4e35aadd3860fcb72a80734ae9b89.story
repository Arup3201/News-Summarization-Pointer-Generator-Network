Apple has revealed that it is creating a 3D map of the world in direct competition with Google over online maps.

The computer giant today admitted to having a fleet of planes and helicopters which have been flying over major cities around the world.

It also plans to monitor iPhone owners when they drive to create live maps of traffic congestion.

The maps have a special 'flyover' feature that let users virtually fly around major cities.

'We have been flying in helicopters and planes, building up a 3D model of these places,' said Scott Forstall of Apple.

Apple's move to add 3D maps comes on the heels of Google's announcement last week that it would do the same with similar technology.

But Apple has aimed to one-up Google with its plans to use 'anonymous, real time data from iPhone users to keep traffic data up to date.'

The traffic monitoring is part of a new satellite navigation feature in the maps app.

Analysts said the decision to abandon
Google Maps, which has provided mapping data for the iPhone since it 
was introduced in 2007, is the start of a 'mapping war'.

Its new mobile operating software, 
called iOS6 will come with a mapping system 'built from the ground up,' 
said Forstall, sidelining the Google map service.

Previously close partners who shared 
board members, Google is now Appleâ€™s biggest challenger in the 
smartphone market with its Android operating system.

Facebook is getting a big boost from Apple in the wake of the social networking site's disappointing IPO, going deep into the iPhone and iPad software.

With the next Apple's iOS 6 software, users will be able to update their Facebook status by talking to their phones.

Users will also be able to 'Like' 
movies and apps in Apple's iTunes store, Apple executive Scott Forstall 
said in San Francisco at Apple's annual developers' conference.

Siri, Apple's voice-command 
application, will add a host of new languages, including Spanish, Korean
and Mandarin Chinese, Forstall said.

'She' will also be able to launch applications and movies - all at the user's command.

Apple hasn't said when iOS 6, will be available. It will run on iPhones, iPads and iPod Touches.

It is also expected to release the next version of its mobile operating software, the iOS6.

Apple started its Worldwide Developers' Conference touting its hardware, its biggest edge over Google.

The tech giant also revamped its existing line of notebook computers.

The new Macbook Air and MacBook Pro have upgraded graphics and memory, and go on sale today.

And
at 0.7 inches, the new MacBook Pro - Apple's highest-end laptop - ranks
among the thinnest laptops in the market.

They
will employ the 'retina' displays that have won strong positive reviews
for the new iPad, but start at an eye-popping $2,199 price tag.

The screen has more pixels than a HD TV.

'To create something genuinely new, 
you have to start again,' said Sir Jonathan Ive, Apple's British 
designer, who recently received a knighthood.

Craig Federighi, Vice president on Mac Software, said the new Mountain Lion system narrows the gap between the PC and phone software packages, allowing users to speak to their computers.

Speaking of phones, those who were anticipating the unveiling of the long-awaited iPhone 5 will have to wait longer, as Apple officials made no mention of a new mobile device.

Marketing chief Phil Schiller outlined how the redesigned MacBook Air notebooks, also unveiled at the conference, will be about $100 cheaper on average than predecessors, but sport quicker Intel Corp processors.

Analysts have speculated that the company will begin aggressively competing on price, gradually lowering the premium its Macs carry in general.

Long lines marked the beginning of the 
week-long annual forum, where Apple developers rub shoulders with 
employees, test the latest products and software, and connect with 
peers.

More than ever, Apple finds itself in a pitched battle with Google: in smartphones, cloud computing, and a never-ending competition to attract the best software developers.

That is crucial as Apple looks to draw users deeper into its applications ecosystem.

CEO Tim Cook, who took over from late co-founder Steve Jobs last August, told the audience that customers have downloaded more than 30 billion Apple apps so far, choosing from more than 650,000 apps - the largest library in the industry.

The firm also launched a new app that 
aims to replace tickets and storecards with an iPhone app. Called 
passbook, it lets users download movie tickets - right to your phone.
