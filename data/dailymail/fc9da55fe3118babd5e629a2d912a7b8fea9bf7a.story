A teenager who contracted a flesh-eating bacteria has been crowned homecoming princess by her high school friends after undergoing 18 grueling surgeries to save her leg.

Alexis Hanford, 16, had been swimming and playing on a rope swing with her sister at Lake Leonard in Redwood Valley, California two months ago when she caught the rare virus.

The teenager, from Bethesda, Maryland has been using a wheelchair since contracting the bug and will likely have to wear a brace for the rest of her life. However the sporty teenager is hoping to make a full recovery.

Excitement: The 16-year-old was named homecoming princess by her fellow students at Walt Whitman High School

On Saturday night, she attended her high school homecoming dance where she was surrounded by friends as they danced the night away. 

She sat in her wheelchair with her left leg wrapped in protective padding as her fellow students cheered when the pink-feather crown was placed on her head.

Miss Hanford, who plays several sports including basketball and soccer, has remained positive about her ordeal. 

She told ABC: 'I've lost a lot of use of my leg but I haven't lost my leg. What you guys would consider normal for walking is going to be very different for me. But eventually, it should become my normal.'

The teenager has kept up with her class and plans to graduate next year before going to college to study biomedical engineering.

Party time: The 16-year-old made it to homecoming dance after spending six weeks in hospital

Her best friend set up 'Alexis Healing Project' to take something positive from the 16-year-old's ordeal. Money raised will be donated to the Children's Hospital in Washington, D.C.

On July 25, Alexis had been attending a family reunion when she gashed her leg during a day out at the lake.

After doctors cleaned the wound, pulling out splinters of wood, she returned home to Maryland. However three days later, she developed excruciating pain in the injury and her leg began to swell.

She was taken to  Children's National Medical Center in Washington, D.C. where she was diagnosed with necrotizing fasciitis, a flesh-eating disease.

Doctors began round after round of surgery to cut away dead skin and muscle, fighting to save her leg. 

Surgeons used a new technique to 
fight the infection by placing cement beads coated in antibiotics 
directly into the wound during every surgery, according to the Star Tribune.
