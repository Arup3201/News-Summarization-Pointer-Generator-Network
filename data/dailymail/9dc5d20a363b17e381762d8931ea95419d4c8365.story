The mother was horrified after she and her baby were left stranded at Gold Coast Airport after their plane turned around on the runway, delivering her to federal and local police who had been alerted by the airline. 

Virginie Rutgers started to feed her 10-month-old son to soothe him while their plane taxied out to the runway on Gold Coast airport.

Virginie Rutgers was forced off a flight with her son after she refused to stop breastfeeding during take-off

Virgin Australia are being questioned on social media for their decision to turn their plane around to take a woman and her baby back to the terminal, where she was questioned by police

She used a baby sling to cover herself and the child for privacy, but was told to remove it by Virgin Australia staff.

‘He (the flight attendant) started to raise his voice and become quite abusive,’ Ms Rutgers told Seven News.

A woman who alleges she witnessed the incident from a couple of seats away has come forward, describing the ‘shocking’ incident on the Virgin Australia Facebook page.

Laureen Fairweather insists the mother and child were sitting in separate seats, with the infant using the appropriate regulation seatbelt while he was being fed.

‘The child was not restrained with the carrier at all! They both had their seat belts on. She was covering herself with the carrier while nursing.’ Ms Fairweather wrote.

‘She showed (the staff) too but they insisted it had to go.’

Ms Fairweather was shaken by the staff’s conduct during the confrontation.

‘Having witnessed the whole event, I can honestly guarantee you that it was not a pretty scene.’

‘(Ms Rutgers) did comply with the rule by restraining herself and the child.’

‘Absolutely gobsmacked at how rude and offensive the staffs were - totally unprofessional (Sic),’ she wrote.

The mother claims staff did not explain why covering her child’s head with a sling was a hazard.

Ms Rutgers continued feeding her child and was subsequently forced off the plane.

‘I was in a state of shock honestly. He (her son) was screaming because I couldn’t feed him any more,’ Ms Rutgers told Seven News.

Ms Rutgers was allowed to go without charge, but found herself stranded with her baby at Gold Coast airport

The pilot turned the plane back to the terminal where Ms Rutgers was met by local and federal police, who had reportedly been summoned by Virgin Australia staff.

Ms Rutgers was allowed to go without charge, but found herself stranded with her baby at Gold Coast Airport.

Virgin Australia has refused to compensate her for the cost of her hotel that evening or for her taxis.

But the airlines denies allegations of discrimination against the mother and said her breastfeeding had nothing to do with decision to remove her from the flight, according to Seven News. 

'Our crew acted in accordance with Civil Aviation Safety Authority regulations and, most importantly, with your child's safety at the forefront of their actions,' Virgin said.

People aware of Ms Rutger’s experience have taken to Virgin Australia’s Facebook page.

‘Utterly pathetic sevice virgin! I fly frequently and will make sure i NEVER fly with you again. I do not want to get kicked off a plan for breastfeeding my child,’ wrote one former customer.

‘Breast feeding is actually really good for the child and surrounding passengers ears and sanity, as it will help settle the child,' a supporter wrote on the Virgin Australia Facebook page

‘(Breast feeding) is actually really good for the child and surrounding passengers ears and sanity, as it will help settle the child. Never ever will I fly virgin,’ another declared.

Representatives from the airline have responded to accusations regarding the case.

‘We can assure you that Virgin Australia welcomes breastfeeding on board our aircraft, as outlined in our policy,’ they replied to a Facebook post regarding the incident.

‘The safety of our guests is always our number one priority and there are a number of CASA regulations that must be followed on board to safeguard this, including ones that apply specifically to infants.’

‘For privacy reasons, we cannot comment publicly on specific cases.’

We can assure you that Virgin Australia welcomes breastfeeding on board our aircrafts, as outlined in our policy,’ Virgin Australia said 

Ms Rutger has vowed to never fly with Virgin again. She and her baby took a Qantas flight the following day

However other people on Facebook have sided with Virgin Australia, pointing out their responsibility to adhere to strict safety protocols.

‘I think anyone with any sense would realize the issue here. Safety comes first. Breastfeeding is a right all mothers should have, but that right shouldn't take precedence over safety,’ argued one person.

‘I am sure that the staff had their reasons for asking her to remove the carrier, it may have been a projectile or strangulation risk in the event of a difficult take off,’ wrote another.

‘I wasn't there so I can't comment on how it was handled but I do think you have to trust the staff when it comes to safety requirements and requests.’

Virgin Australia have offered Ms Rutger flight credit to make up for the additional costs she accrued when she was kicked off her flight.

However, Ms Rutger has vowed to never fly with Virgin again.

She and her baby took a Qantas flight the following day.
