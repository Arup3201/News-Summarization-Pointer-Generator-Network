A grieving mother is trying to raise awareness of male domestic abuse after her son was brutally murdered by the 'psychotic' girlfriend he loved.

Michelle Mills, 31, from Melton Mowbray in Leicestershire, was jailed last year for stabbing Eddie Miller, 20, to death.

She stabbed him 24 times in the front and back with a kitchen knife in an attack that

was so forceful, she snapped the blade.

Missed: Sara with her son Eddie who was brutally murdered by his girlfriend last year

Now Eddie's mother, Sara Westle, has spoken of her heartache at losing her son in such horrific circumstances.

'I would describe her as a monster. I understand that there weren't what they call defence wounds on his hands. I don't want to think about it,' she said.

Mills and Eddie had been together for two years after meeting through friends and had a volatile relationship.    

Sara said she knew the pair often argued but she never believed petite blonde Mills would be capable of murder.

But the mother-of-two had suffered a troubled childhood, was a heavy drug user
 and had mental health issues. Eddie, who was a college student taking a course in hotel management, knew of her troubled past and was determined to help her.

Sara adds that he was also flattered that a more experienced, older woman was interested in dating him.

'He was definitely smitten. You could see the twinkle in his eyes that he was excited,' said Sara of her son when he first started his relationship with Mills.

However, his friends did not take to his new girlfriend.

'My first impression was she was just strange,' says Dylan Rocket, a close friend of Eddie's. 'She'd say inappropriate things.'

He added: 
'She was such a handful, and I used to feel so sorry for Eddie.'

As Eddie and Mills' relationship progressed, she began to become more possessive and tried to stop him seeing his friends.

Sara recalls: 'It was okay for her to go out with 
her friends and have a laugh, have a drink, do whatever girlies do. That was okay. But it was like a rule for one but not for the other.'

Then Mills' behaviour started to become violent.

Sara said: 'There were times when Eddie would stay 
over and she would kick him out in the early hours of the morning. He 
would come home with his face scratched or a black eye. 

'I said, "What happened?" He said that they got into a row and she just went berserk.'

Eddie's friends and family tried to persuade him to end his relationship with Mills.  'I often did say to him, "Are you sure you
 want to be in this relationship? And do you not think it's wise to take
 a break?"' Sara said.

'But he'd say, "No I want to help her, I want to support her.
 She hasn’t had it easy and she is facing up to her demons". He wanted 
to be the rock in her life.'

Dylan added: 'He genuinely thought that he could help her work through her issues.'

Eddie and Mills moved into a rented cottage together in the village of Scalford, Leicestershire, in the summer of 2012.

Their neighbour, Geri Paynter, said she often heard them having blazing rows.

'You don't expect someone 4ft 11, slim, attractive blonde, living next door to you, to turn out to be a killer'

She said: 'They would argue on a regular basis, 
sometimes it was once a week, sometimes every ten days. It never went as 
long as two weeks without an argument.'

But like Eddie's friends and family, she never believed the arguments would escalate to murder.

She said: 'What does a murderer look like? You don't expect someone 4ft 11, slim, attractive blonde, living next door to you, to turn out to be a killer.'

Police were called to Mills' home in the early hours of the 6th November 2012 where they found Eddie bleeding to death.

After one of their usual rows, Mills had armed herself with a kitchen knife and stabbed Eddie 24 times as he sat on the sofa. 

Shocked: Sara never thought Mills would be capable of murder

Paramedics battled to save his life but he died in hospital. Mills was arrested and charged with murder but pleaded not guilty claiming she had acted in self defence.

But her neighbour Geri didn't buy her story for a second. 'I think if you stab someone 24 times you damn well mean them to be dead,' she said.

And chillingly, it transpired that Mills had waited 20 minutes before calling the emergency services, precious time that could have saved Eddie's life.

Dr Keri Nixon explains in the documentary: 'I believe she planned to kill him, and I believe that in those 20 minutes she knew he was dying, and she let him die. At the point that he was lying on the floor, she could have got help. Eddie didn't die immediately. Paramedics battled to save his life. If he'd had 20 minutes of additional help there's a chance he could have survived.'

Smitten: Eddie had wanted to help Mills through her problems. The mother-of-two has been jailed for life

Eddie's friend Dylan said it was this that shocked him the most. 'That's something that a serial killer does, someone who's really quite twisted, psychotic, would do that, would watch their loved one die,' he said.

He added that even though Mills and Eddie had a volatile relationship, he didn't believe Eddie's death was a 'crime of passion'.

He explains: 'Had someone told me that it was a killing of passion, and I said to them you're talking s*** because killing of passion is when you feel passionate about something that moment, and once you realise what you've done you sort of think that you snap out of it.

'You're like, "What have I done? What have I done?" And you will do anything in your power to rectify it, and you will show remorse, that's a killing of passion.

'You didn't mean to do it, and you let the whole world know that you didn't mean to do it. But she didn't do that. She sat there and she watched him die.'

'You were extremely angry with him and 
you were in a rage. He did not realistically stand a chance of defending
 himself such was the ferocity of the attack'

He added that Mills trying to make out Eddie had attacked her first was a further insult.

'The fact that she tried to tarnish his name is disgusting, it goes without saying that he wouldn’t do that. He's not like that. He's just not that kind of person,' he said of Eddie, who was known by many as a 'gentle giant.'

A jury at Lincoln Crown Court didn't believe Mills' protests of innocence either when she appeared in court a year ago.

Judge Michael Heath passed a life sentence on Mills, ordering her to serve a minimum of 15 years.

He said: 'This was a brutal, ferocious and sustained attack. You loved each other but you were jealous of each other.

'You were extremely angry with him and you were in a rage. He did not realistically stand a chance of defending himself such was the ferocity of the attack.

'I detect no remorse in you. You have only been concerned with yourself. You did your very best to hoodwink the jury but they saw through you.

'Throughout this trial you have tried to portray yourself as a serial victim of domestic violence, that picture is not an accurate one.'

Dylan said Eddie's friends and family are now struggling to come to terms with their loss. 'She doesn't realise what she's taken away for everyone,' he explains.

'She doesn’t realise the hole that she's left in people's lives, especially his mum. That's someone you can never replace. He's got a place in my heart and he always will have.'

Sara added: 'I feel robbed and stripped. I miss him terribly.'

But she doesn't want her son's death to be in vain so she is now working to raise the often overlooked issue of male domestic violence.

Dylan explains: 'She wants to turn something that's negative into something that's positive to help other people, and that's just where Eddie gets his good heart and kind nature from, his mum.'
