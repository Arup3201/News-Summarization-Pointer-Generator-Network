Former President Bill Clinton said today he doesn't know if his wife Hillary is going to run for president and said 'she hasn't asked me yet'.

In a CNN interview broadcast on Monday from Vietnam, Clinton said: 'Whatever she does is fine.'

He called wife 'the ablest public servant I've ever worked with'. But he said determining whether to seek the Democratic Party presidential nomination is 'a decision only she can make'.

The former President added: 'I'm not going to try to jump the gun.'

Clinton was in Vietnam as part of the Clinton Foundation's work on global health in Southeast Asia.

He also told CNN  that his wife 'really does need some time to think through' a run for the White House in 2016.

He said that when his time was through at the White House in early 2001, he told his wife that she had made sacrifices to support his career for 26 years, and that he owed her 26 years in return.

The former Secretary of State said herself last Thursday she has not yet decided to run for the presidency in 2016, but that her campaign would include an as-yet unrevealed 'very specific agenda'.

Clinton made the remarks while speaking in an hour-long interview with journalist Charlie Rose on his PBS program as part of her 'Hard Choices' book tour.

When asked by Rose if her agenda will only be revealed after she makes a choice, Clinton said: 'Yes, yes.'

'If I decide to run, I will have a very specific agenda about what I think we should be doing,' Clinton said on the program.

'But right now, we have a big election - midterms 2014 -  that could determine the control of the Senate. And I’m not going to - you know - jump the line and start talking about 2016 right now.'
