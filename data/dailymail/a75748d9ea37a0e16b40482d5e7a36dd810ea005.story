If you’ve ever sent a text to the wrong person, or regretted texting someone while drunk, then the Ansa app could offer some piece of mind.

It works in a similar way to Snapchat, by automatically deleting messages, photos and videos seconds after they’ve been viewed.

However, unlike Snapchat, Ansa lets you also delete messages remotely, from another person’s device, before they get a chance to read it.

Ansa (pictured) was created by 23-year-old Natalie Bryla from San Francisco. It lets people send self-destructing messages, photos and videos when using the ‘off the record’ mode. Users can see when people have read their messages and if a text is sent by mistake, it can be deleted from the other user’s device

The free Ansa app is available on iOS and Android and was created by 23-year-old Natalie Bryla from San Francisco.

‘Ansa is the safest place to let go, and be yourself with friends,’ said Ansa.

‘It’s the only messaging app that lets you communicate like you do in person, without leaving a record behind.

‘With Ansa you can go ‘off the record’, and have full conversations that automatically disappear; send self-destructing photos and videos that only last for seconds; and take back the messages you already shared using synced deletion.’

Videos and photos only appear when a user clicks ‘Tap to view’, and once viewed it is visible for 60 seconds before being deleted. However, people don’t have to use the ‘off the record’ function, and can use Ansa to save conversations in a similar way to other messaging apps such as Whatsapp or Skype

Only users of the app can message each other in 'off the record' mode.

The self-destruct feature does not apply to messages, photos or videos sent using traditional methods or through other apps.

Videos and photos only appear when a user clicks ‘Tap to view’, and once viewed are only be visible for 60 seconds before being deleted from both users’ phones.

Photos and videos can also be annotated, and captions can be added.

However, people don’t have to use the ‘off the record’ function, and can use Ansa to save conversations in a similar way to other messaging apps such as Whatsapp or Viber by not enabling this tool.

In February Facebook bought messaging app WhatsApp for $19 billion (£11.4 billion), after failing in a previous $3 billion to buy Snapchat.

At the start of April, Vine revealed its ‘Vine Messages’ service that enabled users to send messages to each other.

This directly followed once-popular social network Bebo’s attempts to get back into the game with Blab, their own video messaging service.

Facebook, meanwhile, is busy trying to increase the profile of its Messenger app, with rumours that it will shift WhatsApp users onto its native messaging client.

Facebook announced a selfie feature for Messenger that makes it easier to send people pictures of yourself.

It then announced Snapchat rival Slingshot in June.  

Instagram announced Instagram Direct, a direct messaging service last December, and later announced Bolt - designed to be another rival to Snapchat - in July.

In May, Snapchat released the ability to chat with friends in real time via messenger.
