The U.S. should adapt to a European model in the workplace in order to halt global warming, a study says.

By working less hours per week and take longer vacations the American people could reduce carbon emissions, think tank Center for Economic Policy and Research claim.

If the ‘Western European’ working model was to be adopted in the U.S., it could reduce up to 50 per cent of the addressable global temperature rise expected by 2100.

There is a documented link between a shorter work week and lower levels of carbon emissions, which is at the centre of the research by the Washington think tank.

As productivity grows in western civilisations, as well as developing countries, the study analyses the gains from the resulting increase in consumption versus the possible loss as a result of fewer working hours.

It concludes that a developing country expanding at a high rate should chose the ‘European’ model in order to keep greenhouse emissions at bay.

It adds that an American switch to the 'European' system could have a significant impact on global warming.

The research paper estimates that a change could ‘eliminate about one-quarter to one-half’ of global warming which is not already in the atmosphere, and would have particular effect if adapted by workplaces that consume high levels of energy, such as factories.

‘The relationship between [shorter work and lower emissions] is complex and not clearly understood, but it is understandable that lowering levels of consumption, holding everything else constant, would reduce greenhouse gas emissions,’ the study’s author, economist David Rosnick, writes.

He concludes that some climate change is inevitable, but adds that the amount of which is ‘very much under our control’.

‘In addition to reducing emissions by other means, a significant reduction in climate change is possible by choosing a more European response to productivity gains rather than following a model more like that of the United States.’

In the ‘best case scenario’ Americans would begin working about 0.5 per cent less each year, starting with a 10-hour reduction in 2013, which could prevent an increase of up to 1.3 degrees.

‘We can get a similar amount of work done as productivity and technology improves,’ Rosnick says.

‘It's something we have to decide as a country—there are economic models in which individuals get to decide their hours and are still similarly productive as they are now.’

However the study does not take into consideration what people would do with the increased leisure time, and although it says fewer working hours will help, it could be cancelled out if it would mean an increase in holidays with extensive travelling.
