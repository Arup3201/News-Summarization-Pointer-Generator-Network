At least nine students have been pulled out of school and facing multiple charges - including inciting a riot - for their alleged role in a huge food fight - and there may be others.

The mealtime melee erupted on Friday at Ola High School in McDonough, Georgia, with numerous students tossing food items at each other during lunch.

The food fight had reportedly been 
planned for weeks, and when school officials got wind of it, they made 
an announcement before lunch, warning students not to go through with 
it.

But they did anyway, with disastrous results.

One student was injured during the cafeteria-wide scuffle, though not seriously.

Aftermath photos obtained by WXIA-TV showed food splattered across the floor of the cafeteria.

Each of the five non-minor of the students were charged with disruption of public school.

Courtney Striplin, Jimmy Dobson and Devin Graziani, all 17, were also charged with inciting a riot.

Nathan Brunnert, 17, was charged with failure to disperse, and Whitney Camp, 18, was charged with obstruction and possession of marijuana.

The other four arrested students are juveniles, and were not identified.

Additional arrests may be possible after school officials watch surveillance footage of the incident.

Some students decried the arrests as too harsh a punishment for a high school prank.

Ola student Breanna Silver told WXIA-TV: 'I think they went a little too overboard with charging. They could've done like suspension or something.'

While many students have dismissed the food fight as a prank, the school's leaders say that this is no laughing matter.

Henry County Schools spokesman J.D. Hardin told WXIA-TV: If you went out anywhere else in public and did this you would face a similar consequence.'

He added: 'We donâ€™t want our students to participate in this.School is supposed to be a fun learning environment.'
