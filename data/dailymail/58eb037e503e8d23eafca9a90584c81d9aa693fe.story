Stars: Dan Aykroyd as Elwood Blues, left, and John Belushi as Jake Blues became iconic for their performance as the Blues Brothers on 'Saturday Night Live,' in New York

Weekend Update: Chevy Chase performs during a 'Weekend Update' sketch on 'Saturday Night Live,' in the long-running sketch comedy series which will celebrate its 40th anniversary with a three-hour special

The comedy series will feature a star studded turn out from it's alumni and other guests ranging from Sir Paul McCartney to Taylor Swift who are expected at fabled Studio 8H.

Other stars in attendance will be Miley Cyrus, James Franco, Derek Jeter, Steve Martin, Fred Armisen, Eddie Murphy, Jerry Seinfeld, Kristen Wiig and Kerry Washington.

The content of the show is still a well guarded secret and is yet to be determined according to SNL creator and executive producer Lorne Michaels. 

And as proof that the show was still a work-in-progress a few days ago the special subsequently grew by 30 minutes from its originally announced three-hour length.

SNL which was titled NBC's Saturday Night in its first season premiered on October 11, 1975, with comedian George Carlin as host, and Billy Preston and Janis Ian its musical guests.

It was born as the brainchild of Michaels, then 31, who today, at 70, remains very much hands-on. By the end of 1975, it had caught on as a rare TV venue for topical humor and sassy comedy.

Eddie Murphy is among the series' biggest discoveries whose SNL tenure fell during Michaels' absence between 1980 and 1985.

'Eddie Murphy coming is a huge thing,' Michaels said with pride.

Characters: Will Ferrell portrays Craig Buchanan, left, and Cheri Oteri portrays his cheering partner Arianna on a popular segment on Saturday Night Live

Star: Gilda Radner, left, as Rosanne Rosanna Danna from Saturday Night Live and Phil Hartman as Bill Clinton during the 'Clinton-Brown Debate' skit on April 18, 1992 

The show's inaugural lineup included Dan Aykroyd, John Belushi, Gilda Radner and Chevy Chase.

During his breakout performance on the show's premiere Chase launched 'Weekend Update, which led to him becoming the cast-member who regularly voiced the catch-phrase that, after 39 years and counting, remains the show's trademark:  'Live from New York, it's 'Saturday Night'!'

The anniversary show will include sketches and a mash-up of different generations, so people will work together who never actually worked together before on the hit show.

'I can see Russia from my house!': Tina Fey portrays Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin, left, and Amy Poehler as Sen. Hillary Clinton during a skit on Saturday Night Live

So which is which? Sarah Palin and Tina Fey in 2008. The right-wing politician is set to appear once again on Saturday Night Live, where she will have the opportunity to joust with lookalike Tina Fey. (Palin is right)

In 2008, Tina Fey's hilarious portrayal of then Vice President nominee Sarah Palin became one of the show's big hits.

'I can see Russia from my house,' she'd quip in a red suit, glasses and cheeky grin. 

There are rumors that Palin could also be set to reprise her ratings-busting turn on Saturday Night Live for the show's 40th anniversary special.

She last appeared on the show in 2008, just two weeks before election day - although on that occasion viewers were disappointed when she did not appear side-by-side with Fey. 

Honor: On Sunday, the show tweeted that it had received a special new street sign called 'SNL Way' in Rockefeller Plaza to honor it's 40th anniversary

Five Timers Club: Alec Baldwin joined other stars to share his thoughts behind the success of SNL as the NBC late-night sketch comedy celebrates its 40th anniversary in the new issue of The Hollywood Reporter

SNL appeared on American television screens when  there was nothing much to watch on TV other than a trio of broadcast networks and became essential viewing for many American households.

The comedy sketch show has received 156 Emmy nominations, as of 2012, which is the most received by any TV show. 

On Sunday, the show tweeted that it had received a special new street sign called 'SNL Way' in Rockefeller Plaza to honor it's 40th anniversary. 

And SNL will always be remembered for making stars out of comedy legends like Steve Martin, Eddie Murphy, Chevy Chase and many others.

Some of those stars shared the cover of The Hollywood Reporter to talk about why they think it's been so successful for over four decades.
