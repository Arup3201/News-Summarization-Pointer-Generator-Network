Community leaders in Missouri are demanding the removal of the white prosecutor investigating the death of unarmed black teenager Michael Brown, saying Prosecuting Attorney Robert McCulloch is not objective enough for the 'racially charged climate' in Ferguson.

'This racially charged climate demands an independent investigation, and to be perfectly blunt, the African-American community has no confidence that your office can carry out an impartial investigation and prosecution,' state Sen. Jamilah Nasheed said.

But McCulloch, who's been a prosecutor in the racially divided St. Louis County for some 23 years, is not stranger to controversy — and he's not one to give up easily.

Prosecutor Robert McCulloch, who is handling the shooting of unarmed black teenager Michael Brown, has been amid racially-charged controversies for decades

As a teenager, McCulloch — whose 
mother, father, brother and two other relatives worked at the St. Louis 
PD — wanted desperately to be in law enforcement.

Even when he lost a leg to cancer, he continue to chase down his dream.

'I couldn’t become a policeman, so being county prosecutor is the next best thing,' McCulloch told the St. Louis Post-Dispatch.

His first tryout in the national spotlight came a few months after he took office in 1991, when a Guns N' Roses concert turned into a riot that ended up injuring 40 people and 25 police officers.

Frontman Axl Rose was accused of hitting at least one security guard and three concertgoers, as well as thrashing a dressing room.

McCulloch charged Rose with misdemeanor assault and property damage, and pursued him across the country to enforce an arrest warrant.

'Where he goes, we'll be waiting for him,' a determined McCulloch said, according to the Post-Dispatch.

'If he wants to cancel his whole schedule, fine,' he added. 'If he leaves the country, we’ll notify Customs to get him when he comes back.'

McCulloch finally caught Rose after a public uproar and the rock star signed a plea agreement.

But critics say that McCulloch is partial to police-involved violence, especially between white cops 
and black suspects, going back to the shooting of his own father in 
1964.

His dad, 37-year-old canine officer 
Paul McCulloch, was killed in the line of duty while responding 
to a kidnapping at a public housing complex.

The shooter, Eddie Glenn, who was black, was sentenced to life in prison for the shooting.

Then
 years later, now a prosecutor in 2000, McCulloch was forced — not for the last time — to 
ascertain his objectivity when community leaders began questioning his leading an investigation into the shooting of two unarmed 
black men by two white police officers.

The officers were not indicted.

But McCulloch said his decision had nothing to do with his history.

'My father was killed many, many 
years ago, and it’s certainly not something you forget, but it’s 
certainly not something that clouds my judgment in looking at a case,' 
McCulloch told the St. Louis Post-Dispatch. 'It certainly 
makes you more aware of the severity of it.'

Demonstrators continue to gather in Ferguson to protest the shooting of Michael Brown, raising their hands and chanting, 'Hands up, don't shoot'

Democratic Congressman William Lacy Clay, of St. Louis, this week accused the prosecuting attorney of trying to taint a potential jury pool when he released a video allegedly showing Brown robbing a convenience store — on the exact same day that police released the name of the white cop behind the shooting, Darren Wilson.

'I have no faith in him,' Clay said, according to the Post-Dispatch.

St. Louis County Executive Charlie Dooley, who has also questioned McCulloch's objectivity, has asked the state attorney general's office to appoint a special prosecutor to handle the case. 

If he chooses to continue handling the case, Nasheed said, Ferguson might go up in flames.

'If you should decide to not indict 
this police officer, the rioting we witnessed this past week will seem 
like a picnic compared to the havoc that will likely occur, because the black community will never accept that there was an impartial investigation from your office,' added the democratic senator, of St. Louis.

'On
 the other hand, if you should indict, the black community will be 
suspicious of your office's sincerity in carrying forth he prosecution, 
as I can imagine serious questions about the lack of African-American prosecutors in the county.'

But, through a spokesman, McCulloch said his office isn't backing down.

'We are working with the county police,' the spokesman, Ed Magee, told the Washington Post. 'We will continue to work with them if it proceeds to the grand jury and beyond if necessary.'
