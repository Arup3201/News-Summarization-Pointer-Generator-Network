An Eagle Scout whose defence of same-sex unions became an internet sensation last year, has challenged the anti-gay policy of the Boy Scouts of America during its annual conference in Orlando.

Zach Wahls, 20, of Iowa City, Iowa, presented the Boy Scouts leadership with a petition signed by 275,000 people calling for the organization to end discrimination against gay youth and leaders.

The petition was launched April 17 on 
Change.org, the web-based social change platform, by Jennifer Tyrrell, 
32, a former Boy Scouts den leader from Bridgeport, Ohio, one week after
 she was ousted because she is gay. The petition also calls for her 
reinstatement.

Hoping for change: Eagle Scout Zach Wahls needed a little help as he delivered the cartons of 275,000 petitions to the Boys Scouts of America national board meeting in Orlando

Fight: The petition was launched on April 17, one week after Jennifer Tyrrell, 32, an ex-den leader from Bridgeport, Ohio, was ousted because she is gay

Eagle Scout is the top rank attainable in the BSA and requires a major service project to demonstrate leadership, along with numerous merit badges.

It is also fuelled by some star power, with support from chat show host Ellen DeGeneres, Modern Family star Jesse Tyler Ferguson and singer Ricky Martin.

ABC News reported that leaders of the Boy Scouts appeared receptive to Wahlsâ€™ statements.

Mr Wahls told the network: 'It's a dialogue that continues to be difficult for many people. But the members of our community are the ones that pay the price, not the organization as a whole.'

Tyrrell, who will not attend the event, said she is not optimistic.

Ms Tyrrell was honoured for her fight against the Boy Scouts' decision on stage at the Gay & Lesbian Alliance Against Defamation Media Awards in Los Angeles last month.

Mr Wahls, whose defence of his own lesbian mothers and civil unions before the Iowa House of Representatives has been viewed on YouTube more than 2.5 million times, said gay rights advocates are aware of many Boy Scout leaders who support change.

'I think it's a lot closer than people might expect,' Wahls said.

He added: 'It's very clear that there's a lot of support even within the Boy Scouts of America... What we're trying to do is make sure we give them some real credence so they know that they have external support, that there are a lot people that have their back when it comes to actually changing this policy from a national perspective.'

But later, the BSA indicated it would not be changing its policies.

Deron Smith, BSA director of public relations, said in a statement to ABC: 'The Boy Scouts of America teaches its members to treat those with different opinions with courtesy and respect at all times.

'Today, Scouting officials accepted signatures from an online petition and shared the purpose of its membership policy.'

The statement went on: 'Scouting maintains that is youth development program is not the appropriate environment to introduce or discuss, in any way, same-sex attraction. Parents and caregivers should have the right to decide when and how to discuss the issue with their children.'

The Boy Scouts of America in 2000 famously won a 5-4 U.S. Supreme Court ruling allowing the organization to ban gays whose conduct, the Boy Scouts argued, violated its values.

Mr Wahls, his lesbian parents and Tyrrell found that local Boy Scout leaders and parents accepted them regardless of the parents' sexual orientation.

'It was a complete non-issue after people got to know me and know my parents,' he said.

Ms Tyrrell said she was assured by her 
local cubmaster that her sexual orientation was not a problem and she 
was even drafted to be den leader.

However, later, when she became treasurer and pointed out some financial discrepancies in the books, someone told the pastor of the church that chartered her den that she was gay, and the Boy Scouts dismissed her.

'The fact is the [Boy Scout] organization is still run by a lot of older folks who grew up in a time and culture where quite frankly this was not something that was discussed,' Mr Wahls said.

On the Change.org web page hosting Tyrrell's petition, supporter James Dozier was one of several former scouts who posted comments critical of the anti-gay stance.

'It is stuff like this that really demeans all I worked for to become an Eagle Scout... I am so grateful for everything the Scouts taught me and I am proud about being an Eagle Scout, but this really diminishes everything I accomplished,' Dozier wrote.

The BSA is one of the biggest U.S. youth organizations, claiming some 2.7 million youth members and over 1 million adult volunteers at the end of 2011.

It was founded in 1910 as part of the international Scout movement established in Britain by General Robert Baden-Powell.
