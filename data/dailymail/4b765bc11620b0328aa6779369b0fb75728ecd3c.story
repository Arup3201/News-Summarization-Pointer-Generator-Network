British-based Formula One team Marussia have officially stopped trading with the loss of over 200 jobs. 

Marussia, absent from the United States Grand Prix and this week’s race in Brazil, had hoped to take part at the season finale in Abu Dhabi.

But their administrators FRP confirmed on Friday that the financially-stricken team, whose headquarters are in Banbury, Oxfordshire, will not race again.

The announcement that Marussia are folding leaves more than 200 employees without a job

Geoff Rowley, one of the administrators at FRP Advisory said: 'It goes without saying that it is deeply regrettable that a business with such a great following in British and world motorsport has had to cease trading and close its doors.'

Marussia were placed in administration on October 27 and despite stringent efforts over the last few days to find a buyer and keep the team afloat, they have ultimately come to nothing.

Rowley added: 'Whilst the team made significant progress during its relatively short period of operation, operating a F1 team requires significant ongoing investment.

'The group was put into administration last month following a shortfall in on-going funding and the administration process provided a moratorium to allow for attempts to secure a long-term viable solution for the company within a very limited timeframe.

'Sadly no solution could be achieved to allow for the business to continue in its current form.

'We would like to thank all the staff for their support during this difficult process.

'As joint administrators our immediate focus will be to assist staff who have lost their jobs and provide them with the necessary support to submit timely claims to the Redundancy Payments Service.

'The team will not be participating in the two further rounds of the 2014 championship in Sao Paulo and Abu Dhabi. The joint administrators will continue with their statutory duties to realise the assets of the business in the best interests of all the creditors.' 

Marussia joined the grid under the guise of Virgin Racing in 2010, funded primarily by British entrepreneur Sir Richard Branson. 

They won the first points of their history at the Monaco Grand Prix in May after Jules Bianchi finished the race in ninth.

But the team have since been rocked by the Frenchman's horror crash at Suzuka when he ploughed into the back of a tractor during the rain-lashed race. He remains in Japanese hospital in a critical condition. 

After being taken over by Russian industry magnate Andrey Cheglakov, Marussia's own future was secured, but as it has proven only in the short term.

With mounting debts and rising costs, Cheglakov pulled the plug a fortnight ago after his home grand prix.

And it now remains to be seen whether struggling Caterham will follow suit as they, too, are currently in administration and fighting for survival.
