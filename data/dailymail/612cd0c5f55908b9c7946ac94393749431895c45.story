The Duchess of Cornwall's son Tom Parker Bowles was evacuated from his home in the early hours of this morning after a multi-million pound mansion nearby went up in flames.

Sixty firefighters were called to the five-storey house in the exclusive central London district of Bayswater at  around 1.20am.

The blaze affected every floor and part of the roof of the property, which had been undergoing restoration work, but nobody was injured. It was brought under control around ten hours later.

During the incident Mr Parker Bowles, 38, took to Twitter to thank the emergency services. He said: 'Raging fire just broken out. All of
us evacuated. Police, neighbours and fire brigade magnificent.'

Mr Parker Bowles, who took shelter in a neighbour's home with his wife and two young children, later said the incident had brought out the 'best of British' spirit in his street.

He said: 'It must have been about 1.30am when officers came in to get us all out. The kids were still in their pyjamas.

'We have some very nice neighbours who took us in after we were evacuated. The police and fire brigade were exemplary. I really cannot praise them enough. They did a perfect job.

'Incidents like this really do bring out the best of British. We've been able to go back and pick up some essentials but we won't be able to return until tonight.'
