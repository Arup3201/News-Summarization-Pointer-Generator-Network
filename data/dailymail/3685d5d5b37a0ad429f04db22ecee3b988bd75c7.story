Gillingham have sacked manager Peter Taylor after 14 months in charge.

Taylor had been in charge of the Gills since October 2013 but back-to-back home defeats against Chesterfield and Bristol City on Sunday have led to the 61-year-old's departure.

Former Southampton and Everton striker James Beattie, who was manager at Accrington Stanley before leaving by mutual consent in September, is in the frame to replace Taylor.

The former Leicester boss , who also took charge of Gillingham between 1999 and 2000, departs having lost just two of his last nine matches in all competitions but with the club in 20th place in League One.

Andy Hessenthaler, who returned to the club in May as Taylor's assistant, will take charge of their clash with Port Vale on Saturday and could still be in charge for their Johnstone's Paint Trophy area final first leg against Bristol City on Tuesday.

'Peter Taylor has been relieved of his duties with immediate effect,' a brief statement on the club's website read.

'The chairman has asked the coaching staff to assist Andy Hessenthaler with this weekend's game against Port Vale.'
