A teenager who appeared on national television wearing the logo of listed terrorist organisation Islamic State appeared in court on Wednesday charged with affray and the stalking and intimidation of a cleaner at a shopping centre.

Sulaymin Khalid, 19, a part-time labourer from Regents Park in Sydney's west, was at Bankstown local court when he faced the charges.

His look was a far cry from how he appeared on SBS's Insight show on August 12 when he wore a black jacket which featured the Islamic State logo and black hat over his hair.

To court he wore a blue and white checked shirt and khaki green trousers, his black curly hair slicked back in a ponytail.

Khalid previously appeared on SBS Insight wearing the the Islamic State symbol adorned to a black sleeveless jacket as he sat in the audience

Khalid, who goes by the Islamic name Abu Bakr, was accompanied in court by his lawyer Zali Burrows and around six family members and friends.

They walked into court number five after the morning hearing had begun and were there for two minutes as Ms Burrows contested the facts of the charges.

The court was adjourned until October 29.

In court all Ms Burrows said of her client was 'he is in the courtroom today'.

Outside court she told Daily Mail Australia, when questioned about Khalid's support of the Islamic State, 'why don’t you ask him about it?'.

When Daily Mail Australia asked Khalid outside of court why he wore the Islamic state flag on television he said 'want to race me?' and then he ran off down the street with a friend.

His father said 'I don't want to talk about it'.

Police allege Khalid approached a 43-year-old cleaner  at Bankstown shopping centre before threatening and intimidating him as part of an alleged 'religious hate crime'.

Khalid was arrested at about 2.45pm on Friday 15 August in Stuart Lane, Bankstown.

However, he claimed he was simply walking through the shopping centre after seeing a film with a friend when the cleaner – an Iraqi Christian - made a comment about his vest which was adorned with the Islamic State flag, the Sydney Morning Herald reports.

The cleaner apparently objected to the symbol he was wearing and Khalid claims the cleaner actually threatened him.

Khalid has been charged with two offences that allegedly occured between 9pm and 9:30 pm on August 10, including an affray.

Police allege he threatened cleaner Petrus Matlub with unlawful violence 'by conduct such that a person of reasonable soundness if present at the scene would have feared for their safety'.

The second charge against Khalid is for stalking or intimidating 'with the intention of causing Petrus Matlub physical or mental harm'.

The 'black flag of jihad' as used by various organisations since the late 1990s consists of a white-on-black shahada

Khalid is under strict bail conditions. He must report to police every Monday, Wednesday and Friday between 8am and 8pm, he must be of good behaviour and must not go within 50 metres of Bankstown shopping centre

Khalid is under strict bail conditions. He must report to police every Monday, Wednesday and Friday between 8am and 8pm.

He must be of good behaviour and he must not enter Bankstown shopping centre or go within 50 metres of the shopping centre.

He is also on a night time curfew and must stay indoors between 8pm and 7am unless accompanied by a parent or guardian.

Ms Burrows told Daily Mail Australia last month that Khalid is simply a 'young kid who is passionate about injustice'.

She argued a ‘verbal dispute’ between two people wouldn’t normally be treated with such important by police.

She said there is a ‘witch hunt’ against Khalid since he appeared on the SBS Insight show on August 12 wearing the Islamic State symbol.

'Let’s hope the call to press charges does not further fuel the angry and dangerous mob who are bombarding my client and self with threats,' she said.
