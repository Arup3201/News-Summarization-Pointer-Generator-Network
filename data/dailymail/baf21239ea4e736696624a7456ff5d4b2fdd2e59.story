Miss America Organization officials are hopeful Miss Rhode Island will be able to compete in Wednesday night's preliminary competition after she fainted on stage the previous night.

Pageant officials are monitoring Ivy DePew's medical condition. 

DePew was treated and released from a hospital after she apparently fainted during an awards presentation Tuesday night, which was led by New Jersey Lt. Gov. Kim Guadagno inside Atlantic City's Boardwalk Hall. She was standing in the back row of contestants  when she collapsed. 

'During the Tuesday night preliminary competition, Miss Rhode Island, Ivy DePew fainted on stage, and today, she is doing much better,' Sharon Pearce, president of the Miss America organization said in a statement sent to MailOnline Wednesday morning. 

'The Miss America Organization is in close communication with Ivy and her medical team,' Pearce said. 'We look forward to Ivy resuming her activities today and continuing to compete for the 2015 Miss America Competition this week.'

Pageant officials would not release any information on what caused DePew to become ill.

Dena Blizzard, the pageant's host, told the audience 'She just got a little overheated.'

Pageant officials say it still hasn't been determined whether she will compete.

On Tuesday, Pearce told The Associated Press 'She fainted, but she will be OK.'

Sam Haskell III, CEO of the Miss America Organization, said Tuesday that DePew was alert and talking as she left Boardwalk Hall with her family en route to a hospital. He did not know if she would need to stay overnight.

DePew had competed earlier in the evening in the pageant's swimsuit and evening gown competition.

The Philadelphia Inquirer reported that supporters tweeted '#prayersforivy.'

Winners: Miss Ohio Mackenzie Bart, left, won the talent competition for a ventriloquism routine, and Miss Florida Victoria Cowen, right, won the swimsuit competition

Miss Florida Victoria Cowen won the swimsuit competition Tuesday, while Miss Ohio Mackenzie Bart won the talent competition for a ventriloquism routine.

Bart wowed the crowd with a ventriloquism routine in which her dummy appeared to sing the Mary Poppins song 'Supercalifragilisticexpialidocious.'

'I was obsessed with Lamb Chop and I loved Shari Lewis,' Bart told reporters afterward. 'I used to sit with an old sock and I would mimic what they were doing. I just loved it.'

The start of competition came on the same day that yet another casino company, Trump Entertainment Resorts, filed for bankruptcy and threatened to close what will soon be its lone remaining casino, the Trump Taj Mahal Casino Resort, in November. It would be the fifth of the 12 casinos Atlantic City began the year with to close this year.

So the start of the Miss America pageant, an Atlantic City icon for generations, is a welcome diversion for some from the bad news settling over the city like Boardwalk fog.

'Our hearts go out to the many, many people who have lost their jobs,' Haskell said. 'We hope that the Miss America competition, the Show Us Your Shoes parade and all the wonderful events this week are going to help bring some happiness and joy to this great city that serves as the birthplace of Miss America. We know what's going on here and we want to be something positive.'

The next Miss America will be crowned Sunday night.

Here we are! The Miss America contestants are seen Tuesday evening
