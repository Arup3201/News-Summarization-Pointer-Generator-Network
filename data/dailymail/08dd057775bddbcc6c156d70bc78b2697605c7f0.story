She battled not to let the death of AFL husband Troy Broadbridge mar her future after watching the Boxing Day tsunami claim his life as they honeymooned in Thailand in 2004.

Untimely death: Troy Broadbridge played for the Melbourne Demons in the AFL before his death in 2004

Phi Phi Island: Troy was among almost 230,000 people, including 26 Australians, who died on Boxing Day 2004 when a devastating tsunami rolled across the Pacific, destroying parts of Thailand, Sri Lanka and Indonesia

Friends say the couple are now engaged and Trisha, 33, who has reverted to her maiden name, is poised to announce the couple's love in an exclusive magazine interview.

Rewind ten years ago and it was an entirely different affair for the then 23-year-old who was celebrating her honeymoon with Melbourne AFL player Troy Broadbridge.

She watched in horror as her 26-year-old footballer husband was swept out to sea as they  strolled along the beach, hand-in-hand, on Thailand's Phi Phi Island as the tsunami struck.

The way it was: The couple wed on 18 December 2004 and were only married for eight days when the tidal wave ripped them apart

Later she revealed a powerful surge of water uprooted a bungalow in front of them which then hit her and she was swept away in the torrent.

His body was later discovered and identified by his father, Wayne. 

The Melbourne Demons player Broadbridge was among almost 230,000 people, including 26 Australians, who died on Boxing Day 2004 when the tidal wave rolled across the Pacific, destroying parts of Thailand, Sri Lanka and Indonesia.  

Smiling again: Youth worker Trisha met Jake thanks to a dating campaign called Five in Five which challenges singletons to dare each other to line up five dates in as many weeks

The pair have remained tight-lipped about their romance with Jake telling Daily Mail Australia simply: 'I don't really want to talk about it.'

A close friend of the two, based in Melbourne, told Daily Mail Australia: 'Trisha is absolutely lovely, she lost her husband in the Boxing Day Tsunami ten years ago and is now engaged to a lovely guy.

'She is finally able to move on with her life. It's taken some time but she's got a second stab at love,' the friend added.

Trisha, a chief executive officer at St Kilda Youth Service, and Jake, who works at the bar at The Parlor eaterie in Cheltenham, Victoria, caught each other's eye during a dating campaign Five In Five which challenges singletons to date five times in as many weeks.

She has told friends she is excited about the future with Jake and indeed friends on their respective Facebook accounts remark how contented they both look.

Recalling the horror of their trip to Thailand, Trisha said Troy shouted at her to keep her head above water as he was dragged away by tides.

'This was the last time I saw Troy,' she told The Age a year later.

'Often, I'll have a dream about someone I've spent time with during the day, where there's water and I can't save them,' she previously told The Age. 'It's always different places, and the water comes.' 

In her book Beyond the Wave, published in 2005, she talks about the unbearable pain of missing her husband which saw her contemplate suicide.

'Troy was not there to hold me, and he never would be ever again … I sat on the bed with a whole bunch of pills in front of me and the phone in my hand,' she writes.

'I rang my mum, hysterical, and told her to get over here because I was going to hurt myself.'

The nightmares have subsided and Trisha battled to remain positive in the face of despair.

She has worked tirelessly to raise money for victims of the Tsunami and in 2006 received a Young Australian of the Year Award for her work in Thailand and with Australian youth.

She returns regularly to visit the Broadbridge Education Centre on Phi Phi Island, a school erected in his honour by the Melbourne Football Club and paid for by the AFL Players' Association. 

'I never want to forget what happened and I never want to forget Troy,' she told the Herald Sun five years after the disaster.

'He was my first love and someone I admired so much,' she added.

Daily Mail Australia has contacted organisers of the Five in Five challenge but they refused to comment.

The campaign raises money for charities Whitelion, which fights against poverty, and St Kilda Gatehouse, set up to stamp out sexual exploitation among women.
