A Polish man who was caught with stockings over his head performing a sex act on himself outside a police station has lost his sight.

Rafal Ciesielski, 35, was arrested in broad daylight after he was seen in the car park where he got ‘excited’ outside Spalding police station in Lincolnshire on August 12.

He claimed that someone may have spiked his drink and he was ‘ashamed and embarrassed’ by his actions.

'Ashamed': Rafal Ciesielski faced Spalding Magistrates Court, pictured, after he was caught performing a sex act on himself outside Spalding police station

Spalding Magistrates Court heard how a police officer saw Ciesielski wearing a pair of women's stockings pulled down over his face while ‘committing a sex act on himself’.

Edward Johnson, prosecuting said: ‘Another officer also saw what was going on.

‘Both officers were shocked and disgusted by what they saw and found the behaviour outrageous and totally unacceptable.’

The court also heard that the man from Spalding, Lincolnshire, who works in a local fruit factory, had suffered sight problems since the incident.

Rachel Stevens, defending, said: ‘The defendant is completely unable to explain his bizarre behaviour.

‘He was substantially under the influence of alcohol. 

‘He wonders whether someone spiked his drinks - this actually happened in the middle of the day and the last thing he could remember the night before was being in a club. 

‘He is incredibly ashamed and embarrassed.’

Miss Stevens said Ciesielski has suffered ‘a severe loss of vision’ in the last month and been referred for an MRI scan. 

The sight problem means he cannot drive or operate forklift trucks at work although he still works in the factory.

Ciesielski admitted outraging public decency when he appeared in front of JPs on August 30 and was sentenced to a 130 hour work order along with 12 months’ supervision by probation and ordered to pay £85 costs. 

Earlier this year, a father-of-two admitted one count of outraging public decency when he used a small voice-activated camera to make secret upskirt videos of them.

James Manchand, 48, who just hours before had been at a sex offenders course for an almost identical crime, was caught after suspicious security guards at Manchester's Market Street Boots realised he was following women around their store.
