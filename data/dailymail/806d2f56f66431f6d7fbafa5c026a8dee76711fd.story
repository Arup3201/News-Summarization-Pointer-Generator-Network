Coronation Street could soon be filming life on the Weatherfield cobbles in 3D.

The world's longest running soap is planning a 'future-proof' set at its new studio at MediaCity in Salford Quays, paving the way for 3D technology to be used in special episodes.

The show, which was first broadcast in black and white in 1960, already films in high definition.

The move could add an extra touch of drama to scenes such as this one with Jennie McAlpine as Fiz, Chris Foundain as Tommy and Natalie Gumede as Kirsty

But according to the Sunday Express, future episodes could make use of 3D technology - and pilot tests are believed to have started two years ago.

It is believed to be the first move of its kind among television soaps.

The soap is expected to move to the 7.7 acre site at MediaCity by 2014.

Filming is to continue at its Quay Street studio until the move, with the Rovers Return to be refurbished after viewers see it go up in flames next month.

An ITV spokesman said there were 'no plans' yet to film Coronation Street in 3D but that the Street's new studio would be prepared for such technological developments.

The spokesman added that there is no set date for the move to MediaCity.

Earlier this month the BBC announced Doctor Who will be filmed in 3D to celebrate its 50th anniversary in 3D.

And at Christmas the Queen updated her traditional festive speech by broadcasting in 3D for the first time.

ITV says there are no plans to film Corrie in 3D yet, but its new studio will be a far cry from the days of Ken, Mike and Deirdre's love triangle in February 1983
