This is the moment a police van was left danging over a 5ft deep hole after the footpath it was parking on gave way.

The vehicle was being parked by officers in Newcastle city centre when the ground collapsed - leaving a large black gap in the pavement.

Its front wheel became wedged in the mouth of the hole - causing the entire van to tilt to the right.
