Most boys his age would be content with a football, a colouring book and Duplo.

But for three-year-old Harrison Brown, his passion lies in the art of Morris dancing.

The youngster, from Cheltenham, Gloucestershire, spends hours every day practicising his moves - and has even become Britain's youngest Morris dancer.

Having fun: Harrison Brown, from Cheltenham, Gloucestershire, has become Britain's youngest Morris dancer

Sporting a red sash, a floral hat and bells on his trousers, he performs with his local team of dancers on a regular basis, and aspires to become a fully-fledged Morris dancer when he grows up.

Harrison first learned the art of a Morris dancing from an iPad after becoming besotted with the ancient folk tradition a year ago.

Days later, his mother caught him waving her rolling pins and napkins around in the kitchen in a bid to recreate the dance himself.

She later took Harrison to watch Morris dancers perform in the town centre - and he immediately started to join in.

Harrison has now become so popular in his town that the older Morris dancers have 
created a miniature-sized uniform for him, comprising of a sash, hat, trouser bells and a rosette, known as a baldrick.

'I love Morris dancing because I love dancing with the sticks and the cloth,' said the youngster.

'I love Crumpet the horse (a plastic horse head the dancers use) and the Morris men are my best friends.'

Harrison's mother Christina, 41, said her son 'really firmly believes he is a Morris man', adding: 'There is not a single day
 that goes by that he doesn't get all his gear on and practices.

'It is the first thing he says to me in 
the morning, "Can I Morris dance please?" He wakes up singing the tunes 
and is always asking to watch it on the iPad.

'Before he even has breakfast he will have done at least two dances if not more. It is a true obsession. 

'It's at the point that if I'm in a restaurant or car with friends, he will get the napkins from the table and start twirling them, or he'll get sticks from the park to bang together.'

Harrison first became interested in Morris dancing after spotting a group of men performing in his local high street last year.

The then-two year old refused to be dragged away from the spectacle - and when his mother eventually manage to get him home, he began bombarding her with questions.

Just days later, while she was cleaning their home, his mother heard noises from the kitchen, and found Harrison had collected two rolling-pins and napkins to try to recreate the dance himself.

'He kept saying "I'm a Morris man, I'm a Morris man",' the senior sales operations manager said.

'I started opening up YouTube on my iPad and laying it on the sofa for him to see, I realised he was pretty much copying them move for move.

'I did a bit of research to see if I could take him anywhere to see them and found out they danced every week around Gloucestershire.

'By this stage my mum had made Harrison a couple of bells on elastic for his ankles. When I took him to his first meeting with his makeshift uniform he was in awe.

'It was as if you had just met Madonna or something like that, he couldn't believe he was next to real Morris men.

'As they started to perform he started to copy them and it just went from there.'

Passionate Harrison now watches his friends - the Gloucestershire Morris Men - perform every Tuesday

Harrison and his mother now watch the Gloucestershire Morris Men perform every Tuesday - and he has become firm friends with them.

The youngster also regularly helps out at local fundraising events and proudly shows off his dancing skills to raise money for charity.

His mother said: 'The Gloucestershire Morris Men have been fantastic. They came to his third birthday and danced outside and got all the kids involved.

'He is just absolutely fascinated. I think the dancers are hoping he'll grow up as in love with it as he is now.

'He has to be seven to join their practice sessions. They are hoping he will because with his age he pulls down the average age of the group by about 50 per cent!'

Tony Poulter, one of the Morris dancers, said: 'This lad, he just loves us and he loves doing the dancing. He's like our little mascot.'
