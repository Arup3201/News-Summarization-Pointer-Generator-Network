Aston Villa have confirmed the appointment of Tom Fox as their new chief executive.

The former Arsenal chief commercial officer replaces Paul Faulkner, who left last month.

Chairman Randy Lerner said: 'Tom's reputation as a leader and team builder makes him, to my mind, a great fit to take our club forward.

'I was delighted and even flattered by Tom's interest in the Villa job. His achievements at Arsenal speak for themselves.' 

Great start: Aston Villa won their opening game of the Premier League season, beating Stoke 1-0

Boost: Fox's appointment will aid Villa boss Paul Lambert

Fox joined Arsenal in 2009 and had previously worked for Nike, running the company's Asian sports marketing business, before moving to the sportswear giant's US operation as sports marketing director.

Chief financial officer Robin Russell had been Villa's acting CEO since Faulkner's departure and is now expected to return to his previous role.
