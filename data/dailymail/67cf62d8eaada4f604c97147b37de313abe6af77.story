Thierry Henry was a surprise guest at a Welsh school on Tuesday, but rather than appearing in his usual roles as a television pundit or footballer, the Frenchman turned up as a supply teacher.

The Arsenal legend was on hand to give Pen-Y-Dre High School student Emma Morgan an award live on Sky Sports News, and went undercover with an easy-to-see-through disguise as he took the teacher's place at the front of the classroom.

The Sky Sports pundit wore a black wig and glasses in an attempt to fool the class in Merthyr Tydfil, but quickly revealed his true identity once the students cottoned on.

Henry was appearing on his first appointment as a Sky Academy Ambassador, handing out the Sky Sports Living for Sport Student of the Year award for Wales. 

The awards celebrate the achievements of students and teachers in using sports stars and the skills learnt through sport to build life skills for young people. An overall winner, picked from Emma and winners from England, Scotland, Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland, will be decided on Sunday.

Henry said: 'Emma is a fantastic example of the effect Sky Sports Living for Sport can have on young people and I’m delighted to present her with the Student of the Year award for Wales.

'The life skills learned through sport can be applied to all areas of life and Emma managed to turn her life around and reach her potential since being involved in Sky Sports Living for Sport. She’s a deserving winner.'
