Cristiano Ronaldo made an emotional return to Lisbon on Thursday evening as Real Madrid touched down in Portugal ahead of Saturday's all Spanish Champions League final against Atletico Madrid.

The 29-year-old looked relaxed as he chatted with compatriot Pepe after stepping off Real's private plane at Lisbon airport, just 48 hours before Carlo Ancelotti's side take to the pitch at the Estadio da Luz.

Ronaldo arrived back in the capital, where he spent six years playing for Sporting Lisbon before moving to Manchester United in 2003, having been assured of a place in Carlo Ancelotti's starting XI against Atletico.

The Portuguese has not played since Madrid's 1-1 draw with Valladolid on May 7, when he had to be withdrawn after just eight minutes because of injury.

Ronaldo was set to play against Espanyol in Real's final La Liga game of the season last weekend, but felt discomfort during his warm-up and was removed from the squad as a precaution.

Despite worries over his fitness, Ancelotti has confirmed that his star man will be able to face Diego Simeone's title winners.

Speaking on Tuesday, the Italian said: 'Gareth (Bale) and Cristiano will play and that's the most important thing.'

Ronaldo added: 'Nobody wants to miss a final, a final we have been aiming for and it is obviously important.

'If the body can't do it then it is not the end of the world but I will be there, I am confident.'

Defender Sergio Ramos is certain to start Saturday's showpiece as Real aim to win 'La Decima' - the club's 10th European Cup.

The Spanish international has never played in the Champions League final before and describes the chance to win the famous trophy as a 'dream'.

Previewing the clash with Atletico for club sponsors Bwin, Ramos said: 'It's a special moment. It is a dream and a reward for the sacrifices and work of so many years.

'Although we look at it more as a collective level, it is a reward for the work of the team has carried out all of these years.'

There has been plenty of talk about Real's failure to be crowned kings of Europe since 2002, but Ramos insists that his side will not be overwhelmed by pressure

'We shouldn't talk about pressure or obsession either,' he said. 'I think it is more the hopes we have to be able to win the Champions League and to be able to share it with the fans.'

Ramos had claimed that Real were underdogs to emerge victorious in Lisbon, but he now admits that the clash with city rivals Atleti is too difficult to call, even after his side's defeat in the 2013 Copa del Rey final.

He added: 'They aren't very different (the finals), we are practically the same players, there 
is a title at stake. It is 50-50. Both of us will use our strengths to 
try and win the game.'
