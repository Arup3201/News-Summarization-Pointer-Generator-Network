Disney fans are lining up to get their hands on an incredible collection of vintage memorabilia from ‘the happiest place on Earth’.

Providing a glimpse into the theme park’s early days, nearly 1,000 souvenirs from a lot titled ‘The Story of Disneyland’ are set to go under the hammer in what is being billed as ‘the most comprehensive and complete collection’ to hit the market.

Spanning more than 60 years, the set includes an original Donald Duck hat, a Disneyland blueprint, a red flag bearing Mickey Mouse’s face, staff uniforms and tourist photos from the 1960s.

This Disneyland bade is one of nearly 1,000 collectibles that are being auctioned by Van Eaton Galleries

It is believed the rare collection will fetch tens of thousands of pounds when it is sold off piece by piece at Van Eaton Galleries in Sherman Oaks, California, this weekend.

The assortment of souvenirs, games, toys and collectibles from the famous theme park in Anaheim offers a look at Walt Disney’s empire through the ages.

Some of the items date back to the very beginning of Walt Disney’s planning for his first resort, and the one-of-a-kind collection has been amassed over 30 years.

Those looking to own a piece of Disney history can bid on the original audio-animatronic skeleton from The Pirates of the Caribbean, an original Bob Bushman concept drawing for Tomorrowland, and an original Cigar Store Indian from Frontierland.

One of the rarer items, a Disneyland blueprint, is expected to sell for up to  $70,000 (£45,000)

Some of the more unique items include colourful uniforms worn by front-line staff and entertainers

High bids are also expected on a Tiki bird from the enchanted Tiki Room (valued at $20,000 to $25,000 or £13,000 to £16,000) and a Michael Jackson artwork from the Captain EO attraction (estimated at $40,000 to $60,000 or £26,000 to £39,000).

Some of the more affordable items include a 1956 popcorn box (valued at $150 to $200 or £100 to £130), and a 1955 cigar box featuring Sleeping Beauty's castle (estimated at $250 to $350 or £160 to £225).
