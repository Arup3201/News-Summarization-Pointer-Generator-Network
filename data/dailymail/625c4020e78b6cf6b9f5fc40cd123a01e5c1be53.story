The Taliban has offered to release a U.S.soldier held captive for four years in exchange for five senior operatives who are being held in Guantanamo Bay.

Sergeant Bowe Bergdahl, from Hailey, Idaho, is the only known American prisoner of war in Afghanistan. He was captured after leaving his base on June 30, 2009, and it is thought he is being held in Pakistan.

The offer of a prisoner exchange was made by the Taliban from its political office, which opened in Doha, the capital of the tiny Arab country Qatar, this week.

Captive: Sergeant Bowe Bergdahl has been kept as a prisoner of war by the Taliban after being captured

Taliban spokesman Shaheen Suhail said Sergeant Bergdahl 'is, as far as I know, in good condition' but did not comment on where the 27-year-old soldier is being held.

Among the five prisoners the Taliban has consistently asked for are Khairullah Khairkhwa, a former governor of Herat, and Mullah Mohammed Fazl, a Taliban military commander.

The men have been held at Guantanamo for about a decade.

Their release is the top item on the Taliban's agenda, and is seen as more of a priority than peace talks, Mr Suhail, who worked at the Afghan Embassy in Pakistan before the Taliban were ousted from power in 2001, said.

'U.S. officials have made it clear that getting Bowe Bergdahl back from the Taliban is still one of their top priorities,' NBC's Chief Pentagon Correspondent Jim Miklaszewski said.

'It's not unusual when you get into peace negotiations like this that a good faith gesture at the very beginning is some kind of prisoner swap,' he told KTVB.

Sergeant Bergdahl's parents received a letter from their son this month, giving them hope that he is still alive.

Because he is considered to still be in a volatile situation, no details were released from the letter, which was delivered by the International Committee of the Red Cross.

The former ballet student was seen as an unlikely recruit for the Army by some, but family and friends say he admired the military for its discipline and for what he saw as its role in protecting the American way of life, according to the New York Times.

He was lured into a military life by the promise of travel and the chance to help people across the world. But two months after arriving in Afghanistan he was captured.

Since his capture, Sergeant Bergdahl has been forced to appear in several propaganda videos for the Taliban, pleading for an end to the U.S's involvement in the war.

It is also believed that he made a daring escape attempt in 2011. He jumped from a first-floor window of a mud-brick house in Pakistan where he was being held, and escaped into underbrush and forested mountains.

His captors found him three days later hiding in a trench, covered with leaves and nearly naked, according to a report.

Sources described Sgt Bergdahl, as fighting 'like a boxer' when he was found.

Negotiations: Secretary of State John Kerry may meet the Taliban to discuss the swap when he arrives in Qatar

Headquarters: The Taliban has opened an office in Qatar, which has infuriated Afghan President Hamid Karzai

The offer of a prisoner swap comes as Secretary of State John Kerry prepares to travel to Doha for a conference on Syria at the weekend.

He is expected to meet the Taliban, but state department spokesman Jen Psaki said the U.S. had 'never confirmed' any specific schedule with the Taliban in Doha.

Prospective peace talks are also still in question, especially after Afghan President Hamid Karzai became infuriated by the Taliban's move to cast their new office in Doha as a rival embassy, according to ABC.

President Karzai has also suspended 
negotiations with the U.S. on a bilateral security agreement  to cover American troops staying in Afghanistan after Nato withdraws at the end of next year.

At an opening ceremony for the office, a Taliban spokesman said the organization wanted talks with Washington but said its fighters would continue to attack.

Hours after the ceremony, the group claimed responsibility for a rocket attack on Bagram Air Base near Kabul, that killed four American service members.

A prisoner exchange with the Taliban was first discussed in secret talks nearly two years ago. A proposal to send the Guantanamo inmates to Qatar was scuppered when President Karzai demanded that the prisoners were sent to Afghanistan instead.

If Mr Kerry does meet the Taliban over the weekend it will be the first  talks between the U.S. and the Taliban in a year and a half.

Sergeant Bergdahl's family are holding a rally in Hailey on Saturday to support the campaign to bring him home.
