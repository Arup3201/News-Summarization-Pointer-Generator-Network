Murdered baby: The two-month-old had been left in the back of his father's car as the man lit a fire to warm up his shop

Millions of angry Chinese are demanding the death penalty for a thief who murdered a two-month-old baby he found in the back of a  car he stole.

The outrage threatens to upstage the ongoing National People’s Congress in which new Chinese leader Xi Jinping will officially take over the presidency.

The thief, Zhou Xijun, jumped into the SUV parked outside a shop in the north-eastern city of Changchun on Monday and sped off.

Police say that on hearing the cries of baby Haobo in the back seat, he panicked and strangled the boy then buried him in roadside snow.

The baby’s father had left the engine of his Toyota RAV4 running after he dashed into his shop to light a fire before bringing his son inside.

The child’s disappearance led to a huge two-day search involving 8,000 police and thousands of volunteers.

Zhou, 48, handed himself in and  confessed late on Tuesday.

But although Haobo’s clothes and blanket have been found, his body has yet to be recovered.

Under Chinese law, Zhou could escape the death penalty for murder because he handed himself in and instead may receive a life sentence.

China’s popular social media sites Sina and Weibo have been inundated with 5million posts calling for Zhou to be executed.

Many said they are also mourning the death of a caring society and fear three decades of headlong economic growth has left a moral vacuum in its wake.

In a series of emotional TV appeals dad Xu said: 'Please, please don't hurt my boy. Do what you want with the car, but give us back our boy.

'The baby was crying and screaming and I thought he would give me away,' brutal Zhou Xijun, 48, told police.

'So I stopped the car, strangled the baby and buried his body in the snow,' added the killer, now facing the death penalty.

The tragedy touched locals in the city, who lit thousands of candles for the tragic tot.

'I
 can take comfort from the love other people have for my son but I can't
 understand how a human being could do that to a baby for a car,' said 
heartbroken dad Xu.

During the manhunt the police set up roadblocks, combed the city’s streets and checked parking lots after the family alerted police. Taxi drivers also joined in the search.

The disappearance also sparked a huge media and online response, gripping the Chinese nation.

The
 search dominated social media websites, generating far more attention 
than the annual meeting of China's parliament, which opened in Beijing 
on Tuesday.

Several local 
radio channels suspended regular programing to follow the case. Jilin 
Traffic Radio offered a reward of up to £5,000 for information leading 
to the boy's recovery.

Earlier
 on Tuesday, the police said they found the car abandoned in front of a 
school 40 kilometres outside of the city, but there was no trace of the 
baby.

The parents launched an emotional appeal for the thief to let them know where their baby was.

The search ended in heartbreak after the baby was found murdered and the suspected thief and murderer turned himself in.

China.org.cn reported the baby's mother suffered a heart attack on hearing the news and was rushed to hospital.

According to Jilin Province police authorities, suspect Zhou Xijun confessed to officers yesterday.

It emerged that the 48-year-old had previously undergone two years forced labour for molesting women.

He admitted that, after finding the baby on the back seat of the car he had stolen, he strangled the infant before putting his body in a bag and burying it in the snow.

Police had already determined Zhou was the prime suspect before he gave himself up.

The suspect added that he abandoned the baby's clothes and the vehicle near Yongfa town of Gongzhuling. The police investigation continues.
