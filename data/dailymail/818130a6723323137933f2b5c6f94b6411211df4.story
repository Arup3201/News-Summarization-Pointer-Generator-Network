Jimmy Tarbuck has been arrested over an alleged sexual assault on a young boy in the 1970s.

The 73-year-old comedian was detained at his home in Kingston upon Thames, south-west London, and questioned for several hours.

The arrest arises from allegations made to Scotland Yard officers working on Operation Yewtree, set up after Jimmy Savile was exposed as a predatory paedophile with more than 450 victims.

Police have arrested 12 men as part of
 the operation, including convicted paedophile Gary Glitter, comics 
Freddie Starr and Jim Davidson, presenter Rolf Harris and DJ Dave Lee 
Travis. All deny any wrongdoing and investigations are continuing.

Tarbuck
 was questioned after claims about the alleged abuse of a boy in 
Harrogate, North Yorkshire, in the late 1970s.

The comedian, who became a
 well-known TV personality 
in the mid-60s, was arrested on April 26, but it had remained secret 
because North Yorkshire Police chose not to release the information.

It comes amid an ongoing row over the rise of secret arrests.

It is common practice for police forces to release some details of high-profile arrests on the day they take place.

In
 the case of Stuart Hall, Lancashire Constabulary said that publicity 
surrounding the initial arrest of the 83-year-old broadcaster led to the
 majority of his sexual assault victims coming forward.

In Tarbuck's case, the Met decided allegations against him did not fall under their Yewtree investigation and passed their information to North Yorkshire Police.

Last night Tarbuck said: 'I'm not commenting on this. You need to speak to my solicitor.'

A police spokesman said: 'North Yorkshire Police can confirm that a 73-year-old man has been arrested in connection with a historic child sex abuse investigation in Harrogate. He was released on police bail pending further enquiries.'

A week ago, following disclosure of the arrest of Rolf Harris, a Sunday newspaper reported that 'another household TV name' was under investigation. Tarbuck, who has been married to Pauline for more than 50 years, has three children, including 48-year-old actress and radio presenter Liza Tarbuck.

The comedian – known affectionately as Tarby – began his showbusiness career aged 18 as a member of a touring rock and roll show and then as a Redcoat for a Butlins holiday camp in Brighton.

After leaving school at 15 his first jobs were as a mechanic and sweeping the floor of a ladies' hairdresser. He recalled: 'It was a brilliant way to meet girls.'

Tarbuck was classmates with John Lennon at Dovedale Junior School in Liverpool. He claimed the former Beatle once spiked his drink with speed.

The entertainer's first taste of mainstream success came in 1964, when he presented It's Tarbuck 65! on ITV.

He went on to host numerous quiz shows, including Winner Takes All and Full Swing. In the 1980s, he hosted Sunday night variety shows Live From Her Majesty's, Live from the Piccadilly and Live from the Palladium. He was awarded an OBE for services to showbusiness and charity in 1994.
