Former Ivory Coast leader Laurent Gbagbo has become the first head of state to face judges at the permanent war crimes court.

Gbagbo was calm and smiled at supporters in the public gallery as the 25-minute hearing opened in The Hague, Netherlands.

The 66-year-old was extradited to the Netherlands last week to face charges including murder and rape committed by supporters as he attempted to cling on to power.

Unrepentant: A smiling Laurent Gbagbo, former president of Ivory Coast, appears at the International Criminal Court in The Hague on charges of crimes against humanity

Charges: Gbagbo, 66, is accused of being an 'indirect perpetrator' in a campaign of violence against supporters of rival Alessane Ouattara

Prosecutors say around 3,000 people died in violence by both sides after Gbagbo refused to concede electoral defeat, despite losing by a near eight-point margin.

President Alassane Ouatarra took power in April with the help of French and UN forces.

The former president, speaking in French, said he wanted to see the evidence against him.

'I will challenge that evidence and then you hand down your judgement,' he told the three-judge panel.

Gbagbo also complained about his arrest by opposition forces backed by French troops in April, saying he saw his son beaten and his interior minister killed in the fighting.

'I was the president of the republic and the residence of the president of the republic was shelled,' he said.

Killings: A child sits near a mass grave where the bodies of around 30 people were dumped by pro-Gbagbo militiamen in Yopougon, Abidjan, in April this year

Victims: members of the Dosso family, who lost parents, grand parents and five siblings in the violence after an election in April, watch Gbagbo's appearance on television

He also claimed he was not told he was being taken to The Hague from northern Ivory Coast, where he was under house arrest.

The brief hearing was to confirm Gbagbo's identity and ensure he understood the charges.

According to court papers, he is charged as an 'indirect perpetrator' in a carefully orchestrated campaign of violence against supporters of Mr Ouattara.

Another hearing has been scheduled for June 18, when prosecutors will present a summary of evidence and the judges will decide whether it is strong enough to merit bringing Gbagbo's case to trial.

Gbagbo's adviser Toussaint Alain said: 'It's a neocolonialist trial. The (ICC) has become an instrument of France... to empower friends and punish the ones who don't follow along.'

Extradited: Gbagbo was flown by helicopter from northern Ivory Coast, then by plane to Rotterdam before being transferred to a detention centre in The Hague

Rival: President Alassane Ouattara won the election by nearly eight points, but nearly 3,000 people died in clashes between the rival groups

His lawyer, Habiba Toure, questioned the legitimacy of his detention.

'In principal, an arrest warrant is delivered to a free individual or a person on the run, which was not the case for Mr Gbagbo because he was already in the hands of Ivory Coast officials.'

Human rights groups say grave abuses were committed by forces loyal to Mr Outtara, who enlisted the help of a former rebel group to oust Gbagbo.

Gbagbo is the sixth suspect taken into custody by the court, all of them in Africa. A further 12 suspects remain at large.

He claims he was told he was going to meet a magistrate in Ivory Coast and was surprised when the arrest warrant was produced.

He was taken by helicopter from remote Korhogo on November 29 and put on a plane to Rotterdam where he arrived the next day.

A convoy of police vans then drove him to the Scheveningen detention centre in The Hague, where former Bosnian Serb military leader Ratko Mladic - the 'butcher of Bosnia' - was housed earlier this year alongside political partner Rodovan Karadzic.

Inmates in the centre include Charles Taylor - the former Liberian president charged with committing murder, rape and sexual slavery as he sought control of Sierra Leone's 'blood diamonds' - and Thomas Lubanga, the Congo warlord charged with recruiting child soldiers.
