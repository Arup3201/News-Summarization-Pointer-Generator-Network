For Krissy, 21, home is a large, rubbish-filled storm drain in the business district of Jamaican capital, Kingston.

Homeless since the age of 12, his life has been one of hardship, moving from place to place, each squat becoming progressively dirtier, flimsier and more dangerous.

But Krissy's bad fortune hasn't come about because he refuses to work or lacks education. Instead, Krissy, and others like him, are ostracised purely because he is gay.

Tough: Krissy, just 21, has been homeless and ostracised since the age of 12 because of his sexuality

Jamaica is a country where 80 per cent of the population admit to being homophobic and having gay sex is punishable with 10 years of hard labour in prison.

Evangelical preachers who promote homophobia attract huge and receptive audiences, while lyrics in popular songs regularly include exhortations to 'kill the batty boys'.

As a result, men like Krissy, who says he has always felt like a man trapped in a woman's body, are forced to the margins of society, with many cast out by their families.

Living with Krissy in the drain is a group of 25 men, many of whom have to work as prostitutes to survive, and all of whom face a barrage of violent abuse on a daily basis.

'This is a homophobic country,' says Thelma, another transgender man living in the drain. 'You can't
 just go and sit in the park, 10 or 20 men, sit and hold hands and 
laugh.

'If gay people are going to meet, you need a safe space to meet.'

Grim: The men share this filthy storm drain with 22 others and are flooded with sewage and water when it rains

Precarious: Sachaberry climbs down into the drain in her platform heels. She works as a prostitute

For now, that safe space is the drain, although as Channel 4's Ade Adepitan reveals in tonight's episode of Unreported World, that safety is precarious.

In one scene, a crowd streaming back past the drain from an athletics meet turns violent, peppering the gully with stones and screaming insults.

Asked what is happening, one replies: 'Them [the crowd] are troubling them because they 
think them are gay, which is a man who goes with a man.

'Them boys will 
come out and they will burn them up. I want them to burn them up.'

When the riot police arrive, they turn their attentions not on the crowd but to the men instead.

'Members of the diverse society, or if 
you want to call them, a group of homosexuals, throwing stones at people
 passing, pedestrians,' one explains when asked what is going on.

For Krissy and his friends Sachaberry and Thelma, this is a risk they run every day.

'It is very, very dangerous to do what I
 do,' explains Sachaberry, who works as a prostitute. 'I'm running a great, great risk. I know friends who passed on 
because of it, who died, got gunshots, were stabbed...'

Sachaberry was herself stabbed when she went to meet a client and found an angry gang of more than a dozen men waiting for her.

'One of them was doing the damage,' she remembers. 'One of 
them had the knife, one of them doing the damage. They punctured a 
lung... Four times. I could have died.'

Krissy too has suffered violent attacks and chose to leave home rather than allow his family, who live in a poverty-stricken part of the Jamaican capital, to be stigmatised by association with him.

Painful: Sachaberry shows off one of the scars left after she was stabbed four times and almost died

Furious: Local councillor Carrie Douglas confronts the men. She wants them to be cleared out of the drain

'You have some Jamaicans who will be moved [by my plight] but it would still leave like a stigma and bring down the family,' he says.

Although still close to his sister, he hasn't seen his parents for years and cannot even walk the streets of the shanty where he grew up for fear of attack.

'If I could [walk through the streets], 
life would be 100 per cent better for me,' he says. 'I wouldn't have to go back 
into the gully. This is my yard, this is 
where I was born. This is where I had most of my fun growing up in life.'

Quite how precarious his life has become is made plain when you hear from local district councillor, Carrie Douglas, who would like nothing more than to turf the group out of the storm drain.

'Jamaica is homophobic, Jamaica isn't foreign,' she froths. 'So you can't 
come to Jamaica and dress up like a drag queen like you are foreign.

'And
 guess what! You can do it but if you do do it, you are going to be at a
 disadvantage. Standing here, living underneath the gully is a 
reflection of that.'

Dangerous: Krissy, pictured with reporter Ade Adepitan, says he hopes an angel will take him away one day

'Behind us is a residential community,' she adds. 'I get reports of petty theft, persons entering illegally into their back yards, whether to make out with people, or to use it as their bathroom.

'That is why the commander of the New Kingston police will try to remove them from this gully. I don't know where they will go after this. That is not my responsibility.'

Although Sachaberry insists that a dangerous life on the margins of society is a price worth paying to be herself, it's clear that the strain is beginning to tell on Krissy.

'I think when I can't bear it anymore, 
the Lord will send some angel for me who will let me feel relief,' he says, as tears slide down his cheeks.

'Right 
now I'm going through a very hard time. I see where I come from and I 
see my family and I miss them a lot.

'This life I'm living is not for me 
but I have to cope with it and bear it.'
