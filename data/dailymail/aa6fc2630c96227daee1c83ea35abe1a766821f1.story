Two 16-year-old asylum seekers living in Adelaide were taken from their carer without warning or explanation and have been moved to a detention centre in Darwin, causing outrage in the boys' community and school.

The boys, who cannot be named, came to Australia from Vietnam in 2011 and after some time in Inverbrackie Detention Centre were released into community detention in Adelaide where they attended school and joined a local soccer team.

The boys were taken on Thursday June 26 after school while they were at their carer's home playing Xbox.

'There was a knock at the door and four people were at the door – two federal police and two immigration officers,' said Meredith Edwards, the principal of Woodville High School, which the boys attended. She has been in contact with one of the boys via phone calls over the last month.

The boys were handed letters dated the same day, one of which has been provided to Daily Mail Australia.

'The Minister for Immigration and Border Protection [Scott Morrison] has made a decision that your residence determination is no longer in the public interest,' the letter reads.

'As such the the Minister for Immigration and Border Protection has exercised his public interest power... to revoke your residence determination.'

Ms Edwards said the boys had not broken any of the conditions of their community detention, which require them to attend school, abide by the law and not to make public comments and were given no reasons as to why their residence had been revoked.

She described the boys as 'highly academic and focused on success,' and said they would make 'incredibly loyal citizens'.

When they received the letter, Ms Edwards said the boys were distressed and asked what they had done wrong, to which one of the officers replied: 'You haven't done anything wrong, this is just what the minister wants.'

'That's the most distressing thing, they don't understand what they've done. A lot of them thought when they were placed in community detention, that meant they were worthy of getting a protection visa,' said Ms Edwards.

Students at Woodville High School have begun a campaign to bring back their friends from the detention centre in Darwin

The boys were told to pack their bags and were then taken to Inverbrackie detention centre in separate cars. 

Ms Edwards said the next morning they were woken at 3am and flown to Darwin on separate planes, each accompanied by four security guards.

'They're slightly built 16-year-old asylum-seekers,' said Ms Edwards. 'Each slightly built 16-year-old boy had four Serco guards circling them so they couldn't run… they were so confused.'

Ms Edwards said the school received no official notification of the boys' removal.

Brad Chilcott, National Director of Welcome to Australia, a not-for-profit that works with asylum seekers, says the way in which the boys' removal had been conducted encouraged 'distrust, fear and suspicion'.

'You can't say that it's in the best interest of these kids to move them at 3 o'clock in the morning surrounded by four guards in two separate planes,' he told Daily Mail Australia.

'I just imagine my kids in the same scenario and how I would want them to be treated. It's not in a way that increases or even revisits the trauma they've experienced in their home country or increases their distrust of authority, but in a way that upholds their dignity.'

A student at the high school started a petition encouraging Scott Morrison to allow the two teenagers to return to their Adelaide community. At time of writing it had 8,584 signatures

The Department for Immigration and Border Protection told Daily Mail Australia that it was following 'standard operating procedures' which had 'been in place under successive governments for some years'.

'The Minister may choose to return a community detainee to an immigration detention facility for a range of reasons including progressing status resolution, a breach of the conditions of their community detention, or where he considers it to be in the public interest,' a spokesperson for Mr Morrison told Daily Mail Australia.

The boys are now being held at Wickham Point Alternative Place of Detention in Darwin from where they fear they will be deported back to Vietnam.

Students at Woodside High School have rallied behind their fellow students and have begun petitioning their local State MP, Jay Weatherill, the premier of South Australia, to release them from held detention.

An online petition, Bring Our Boys Back Home, started by a Woodside High School student has garnered more than 8,000 signatures. The students also have a Facebook page and are using the hashtag #twotoomany. They have also planned a rally on the Adelaide Town Hall steps on August 2nd.
