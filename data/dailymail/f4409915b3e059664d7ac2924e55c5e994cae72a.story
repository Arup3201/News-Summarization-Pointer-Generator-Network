It appears to promote the idea that women can’t park.

But officials hope they won’t be complaining when it means they get a prime spot in the centre of town.

These extra-large parking spaces have been created in a £60million scheme to make Seoul, in South Korea, more female friendly.

Women only: A £60m scheme in Seoul, South Korea, has designated parking bays for women only, which are marked with pink outlines and a figure wearing a skirt

The spaces, dubbed ‘she-spots’, are longer and wider – 8ft 2.5in rather than 7ft 6.5in – than standard and are marked with bright pink outlines and a female logo.

They will also receive better lighting and be placed closer to shops.

The authorities say they created the spaces for safety reasons, and not because of women’s reversing skills.

Though it is not clear whether men who park in the spots will incur a fine.

The scheme in Seoul will also see 
pavements resurfaced with a ‘slightly spongy material’ that makes them 
easier to walk on in high heels.

As part of the effort, around 7,000 new toilets just for women will also be installed across the city.

Some South Koreans welcomed the news, particularly as the spots will be located near shopping mall elevators and escalators.

But others reacted angrily. The measures have sparked accusations of sexism similar to that which officials in the German town of Triberg were met with in 2012 when they introduced a similar programme.

The Assistant Mayor for Women and Family Affairs Cho Eun-hee told the Korea Times newspaper: ‘It is like adding a female touch to a universal design and make things more comfortable for women.’

China, Kuwait, Malaysia, Indonesia, Austria and Italy also have women-only parking spots.

Australia doesn’t have spots reserved for women but they do have ‘family’ car parking spots in shopping malls for parents with infants.

Triberg Mayor, Gallus Strobel, said he was accused of ‘male pig-headedness’ because the female spots were better lit and wider, while the male versions were flanked by concrete pillars and could only be reversed into.

Triberg’s Mayor, Gallus Strobel, told Der Spiegel that two spaces in the town would be too difficult for women because they required drivers to reverse diagonally between a pillar and a wall.

‘I am happy, and it looks like we’ve hit a raw nerve in society,’ he said. ‘It’s been a great marketing gimmick. Women can come here and prove me wrong, and while they’re at it they can see the town’s attractions.’
