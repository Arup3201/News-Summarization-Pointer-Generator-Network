A man has admitted killing a 14-year-girl who was fatally injured after being struck by his car in a horrific hit-and-run road smash.

Jasmyn Chan pushed her friend - who cannot be named - out of the way of an oncoming vehicle driven by Naseeb Ellahi, before being struck herself.

Despite desperate attempts by paramedics to save her, the teenager died in hospital after the incident, which happened just yards from her home on Friday, May 9 in Sheffield, South Yorkshire.

Ellahi left the scene and was arrested almost a week after the schoolgirl was hit by his car.

Today, 32-year-old Ellahi pleaded guilty to causing death by dangerous driving, causing serious injury by dangerous driving, failing to stop at the scene and failing to report.

He pleaded not guilty to two further charges of causing death by driving while uninsured and causing death by driving while unlicensed.

Members of Jasmyn’s family watched from the public gallery at the court as an emotional Ellahi entered his pleas. Some of her family were in tears after the shock plea.

Ellahi, who lives in Birmingham but formerly lived in Sheffield, was arrested on May 15, nearly a week after the fatal smash.

More than a thousand mourners attended Jasmyn’s funeral earlier this year.

Family, friends and well-wishers stood in complete silence as Jasmyn's white coffin arrived in a horse-drawn hearse.

The hearse was followed by family and friends being driven in two limousines and a vintage motorised hearse carrying floral tributes.

The coffin was carried into the crematorium to the Enrique Iglesias song 'Hero', followed by her family - each carrying a white rose.

Mourners who had been patiently waiting outside began to file in, but the huge crowd meant many stood in the sun and listened to the short service on loudspeakers.

A petition signed by more than 12,000 people called for road safety improvements at the spot where  the youngster lost her life.

The road safety campaign prompted Sheffield Council to promise to invest in improvements which will include ‘Jazzy’s Crossing’.

The family of Jasmyn, who was from Sheffield, have also set up a new charity foundation in her memory.

Ellahi was granted bail and will be sentenced at the end of the month.
