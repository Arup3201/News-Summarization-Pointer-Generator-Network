Payout: Tracy Godwin has won compensation four years after her 1lb son Tom died in her arms

A mother whose baby died in her arms after medical staff refused to resuscitate him has won compensation from the hospital.

Tracy Godwin, 34, gave birth to Tom, weighing just 1lb, after 22 weeks of pregnancy.

As his condition deteriorated, she pleaded with the midwives to revive him.

But staff at Southend University Hospital in Essex refused and he died 46 minutes later.

Although NHS guidelines make it compulsory to resuscitate babies born after 23-25 weeks of pregnancy, hospitals determine their own policy for babies born earlier.

Southend Hospital does not resuscitate 
babies born after 22 weeks unless the mother asks them to.

Now, after a four-year court battle, Ms Godwin has won a legal claim for damages from the hospital trust.

Her case has also made it compulsory for staff to read out their policies to expecting mothers before the birth.

Today, Ms Godwin, an accounts assistant from Southend, said : 'I had many unanswered questions concerning my treatment and the death of my baby, which caused me to become severely depressed and unable to work.

'I was left alone, desperate and helpless to alleviate the suffering of my baby boy.

'I was given no guidance or warning on the hospital’s treatment of very premature births.'

Ms Godwin went into labour with Tom, her first child, in March 2010 after just 22 weeks of pregnancy.

She gave birth three days after first experiencing labour pains and was warned her baby was unlikely to survive because he was so premature.

But when he was born alive, she urged staff to take him to a special care unit.

As no consultant was present, nurses refused.

She was then informed that resuscitating her baby was against hospital guidelines.

New rules: Midwives at Southend hospital are now duty-bound to read out their policies to expecting mothers

She discovered that babies born following between 23 and 25 weeks of pregnancy are routinely resuscitated, but it is up to individual NHS trusts to decide their own policy regarding babies born at just 22 or 23 weeks.

Ms Godwin said she had not been informed of this policy.

Since the tragedy, she has given birth to a daughter, Isla, who was born at 24 weeks.

Southend Hospital’s chief nurse, Sue Hardy, said in a statement today: 'Once again we offer our sincere condolences to Ms Godwin on the loss of her baby, and are again sorry that her experience of care did not meet the high standard we strive to provide.

'It is essential that we inform prospective parents of premature babies the expectations for their infant’s survival between 20 and 24 weeks’ gestation.

'In light of this we have strengthened our communication policy around this deeply sensitive issue.'
