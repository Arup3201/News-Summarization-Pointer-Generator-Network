Levi Strauss CEO Chip Bergh has revealed that he hasn't washed his favorite pair of jeans for a year.

The 56-year-old arrived at Fortune magazine’s Brainstorm Green conference on Monday in California wearing the dark denim pants, which he admitted were 'yet to see a washing machine.'

He continued telling the crowd of business leaders gathered: 'I know that sounds totally disgusting, I know it does . . . [But] I have yet to get a skin disease or anything else.'

Asked how often people should be washing their jeans, Mr Bergh replied 'not very often.'

He added that 'real denim aficionados' never put their threads near soap and water.

Instead he recommends simply dabbing stains with a sponge or using a toothbrush for more stubborn marks.

Andy Sewer,
 Fortune's managing editor who interviewed Mr Bergh, looked a little 
disgusted at his revelation, although he admitted the tight-fitting 
pants looked 'pretty good.'

Steeped in history: Mr Bergh became the CEO of Levi Strauss in 2011 - the company celebrated the 141st birthday of its 501 jeans this week and is now striving to create more sustainable products

Tags on Levi Strauss jeans urge customers to wash less and use only cold water.

Mr Bergh isn't the only one ditching the wash cycle.

Last year, Tommy Hilfiger also revealed that he 'never' washes his jeans - his favorite brand being Levi Strauss over his own eponymous label.

The 63-year-old told a TMZ reporter: 'I never wash my Levi's. They'll fall apart. I love them broken in.'

And TV anchor Anderson Cooper told how he wears the same jeans every day, washing them on average only four times a year.

He admitted that he also had an unconventional method of cleaning his jeans: wearing them in the shower.

'So the times I've washed my jeans, maybe twice in six months . . . I've worn them and walked into my shower with them and put some soap on them and then air dried them.'

Levi Strauss celebrated the 141st birthday of its 501 jeans on Tuesday.

The California-based company is now striving to create denim products that last longer and require less washing in a bid to promote sustainability.

In 2011, Levis Strauss introduced a stone-washed denim brand smoothed with rocks but no water, its cleaning instructions urging customers to wash their jeans rarely, if at all, and put them in the freezer instead.

Freeze cleaning doesn’t remove dirt or dust, and certainly does not remove stains, but it does kill the germs that cause jeans to smell.

Levis advises customers to put jeans in a plastic, zip-lock bag and put them in the freezer for 24 hours.

And according to a student-professor team that tested a pair of jeans at the University of Alberta, wearing raw denim jeans for 15 months without washing them does not pose any health risks.

Josh Le, 20, bought a pair of Nudie Jeans in 2009 and wore them nearly every day, even sleeping in them for a month and spilled food on them (wiped off with a paper towel).

But when Mr Le and assistant human ecology professor Rachel McQueen swabbed the inside of the jeans and tested them for bacteria 15 months later, they found levels to be normal.

Mr Le then washed the jeans, wore them for 13 days, and re-tested them. The bacteria levels were nearly identical.
