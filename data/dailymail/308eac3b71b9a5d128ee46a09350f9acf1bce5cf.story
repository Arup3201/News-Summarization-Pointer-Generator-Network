Most people who stumble upon ancient mummies run for the hills and call the police, but one Chinese farmed saw an opportunity for treasure.

Farmer Miao Piang is being held on grave robbery charges after digging up two ancient mummified corpses to make way for a new barn.

Days later, villagers in Jiazhuang, Shandong 
province, discovered the mutilated remains floating in the local pond 
with their broken caskets.

‘It was like something from a horror film. It was like they were coming back to haunt their tormentor,’ said one.

Mr Miao admitted to dumping the bodies in the water after digging up an ancient burial site to make way for a new building.

‘He also thought that being ancient, the tombs might contain some treasure,’ said a police spokesman.

‘Jewellery found on the bodies was split between Mr Miao and his friends, who had helped him,’ they added.

Mr Miao is facing ten years in jail for grave robbery if he is convicted.

Chinese burial traditions see many cemeteries or tombs located on hillsides. A high resting place is seen as a good omen.

One of the reasons for China's tough laws on the desecration of graves and tombs derives from the closing of the casket.

At the funeral, the coffin is nailed shut with mourners turned away from the casket as it is thought to be a bad omen to watch.

After this 'holy paper' is pasted onto the coffin to protect it from holy spirits, which would be broken if it was ever opened.
