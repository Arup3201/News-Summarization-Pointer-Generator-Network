As celebrities begin jetting into Australia ahead of I'm A Celebrity Get Me Out Of Here - the ITV show that sees stars slum it in the jungle - thoughts are turning to who might win the battle of the bikini body.

And with fitness fanatic Melanie Sykes, 44, and glamour model Kendra Wilkinson, 29, fuelling rumours by landing in Australia overnight, it's likely to be one glamorous show. 

So will the duo give Myleene Klass' iconic white bikini shower scene back in 2006  a run for its money? And who else came close over the last few years?

From Amy Willerton to Helen Flanagan, FEMAIL looks back on the best swimwear moments from the past ten years and how those shower scenes have boosted the careers of the fame-hungry stars.

Iconic: Myleene Klass became more famous for her white bikini-clad shower scene in 2006 than her jungle antics and now she's a household name 

Pageant queen: Amy Willerton was relatively unknown when she entered the jungle last year but has since gone on to land herself men's magazine covers and numerous modelling gigs - so was it thanks to her shower scenes?

Catapulting her to stardom: Helen Flanagan's bikini scenes in 2012 helped promote her from Coronation Street sweetheart to lad mag favourite - and she even topped FHM's Sexiest Woman in the World poll 

From Essex to stardom: Not only did Stacey Solomon, 25, take home the jungle queen crown in 2010 but she's since landed numerous campaigns and modelling gigs 

Remember me? Hollyoaks and Casualty actress Gemma Atkinson was one of the show's original bikini babes when she starred on the reality TV show in 2007

Giving Myleene a run for her money? Melanie Sykes is rumoured to be heading into the jungle this year after touching down in Australia - so will all her workouts pay off in the battle of the bikini bodies?

Competition? Glamour model Kendra Wilkinson is also rumoured to be heading into the jungle and with a body as toned as hers, Melanie has tough competition
