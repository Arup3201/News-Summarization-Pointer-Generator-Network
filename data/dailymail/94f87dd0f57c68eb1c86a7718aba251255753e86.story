Radio host Ryan 'Fitzy' Fitzgerald says he had a chance encounter with the Church Of Scientology, the secretive faith that counts Tom Cruise and John Travolta among its celebrity devotees.

Co-hosting Australia talk show The Project on Tuesday night, the Nova FM personality, 38, revealed a meeting with actress Jenna Elfman 13 years ago in Los Angeles led him to the religion's rarefied circle.

Recovering from his third knee construction, the former AFL player was holidaying in the US when he bumped into the Dharma and Greg actress who told him she could 'fix' his on-going knee problems, through a 'purification process'.

Face of the religion: Documentary Going Clear claims Scientology was behind the breakdown of Cruise's marriages to both Katie Holmes and Nicole Kidman 

Elfman, 43, and her husband Bodhi are listed on the religious organisation's website and she first made a public appearance on behalf of the Church Of Scientology in 2005.

Since then she has spoken at various events including co-hosted the Scientology-affiliated New York Rescue Workers Detoxification Project Charity Event with actor Charlie Sheen.

Controversy has long surrounded the mysterious religion which counts Tom Cruise as one of its devout followers.

A controversial documentary premiered on HBO on Sunday and at the Sundance Film Festival claims the Church of Scientology broke up Cruise and Nicole Kidman, who divorced in 2001.

Marty Rathbun, formerly the second highest-ranking official, claims he had been appointed to 'facilitate the breakup' because the head of the church, David Miscavige, was suspicious of Cruise's second wife, pictured at Mission Impossible 2 premiere in LA

Going Clear, created by Alex Gibney, makes a number of startling revelations about the organisation - including allegations they used aggressive intimidation tactics to force the Hollywood couple apart.  

The film, based on the book by journalist Lawrence Wright, is an expose of the controversial religion - claiming that it evades taxes and abuses its members.

Marty Rathbun, formerly the second highest-ranking official, claims he had been appointed to 'facilitate the breakup' because the head of the church, David Miscavige, was suspicious of Cruise's second wife.   

Scientology is believed to be one of the reasons behind the breakdown of Cruise's marriage to Katie Holmes because he was understood to have wanted to send their daughter Suri to Sea Org, pictured in 2011

Scientology is believed to be one of the reasons behind the breakdown of Cruise's marriage to Katie Holmes because the actor was understood to have wanted to send their daughter Suri to Sea Org,  a paramilitary wing of the Church, according to reports at the time.

Interviews with former senior members and officials also included descriptions of a 'prison camp' and claims that Scientology chiefs hold a 'black PR package' on Travolta, with all the disclosures he made during auditing sessions.

The claims have been disputed by the Church, who have branded those who featured in the show - many former senior members - as 'admitted' liars and perjurers and 'professional anti-Scientologists.'
