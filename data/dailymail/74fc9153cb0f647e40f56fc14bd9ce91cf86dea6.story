Callous thieves smashed their way into a safe and stole cash raised for an operation to help a severely-disabled boy to walk.

Parents Faye Weeks, 26, and partner James Potts, 31, were told £1,400 towards surgery for son Corin, three, who has cerebral palsy, was taken in the community centre raid.

The heist was captured on CCTV and shows the moment the two thieves cracked open a safe and stole the money raised towards a £35,000 operation to help the youngster walk.

Corin was diagnosed with cerebral palsy when he was 18 months old and cannot walk unaided

The heartless thieves struck just hours after family and well-wishers had held a series of charity fundraisers.

Mr Potts, a postman, said: 'It's pretty sickening. I think what these people have done is disgusting - but some people don't have any morals, do they?

'If it was for someone else's child we'd feel exactly the same. We had a brilliant event on Saturday and I'm gutted that one or two people have let everyone down like this.

'It was never really our money - I just feel sorry for all those people who donated.'

The couple, from Yate, near Bristol, held a pub treasure hunt, auction and a karaoke event to raise money for their Corin's First Steps appeal.

Corin was diagnosed with cerebral 
palsy when he was 18-months-old and cannot walk unaided and relies on a 
walking frame or wheelchair to get around.

The charity is trying to find £35,000 
for the brave little boy to have a life-changing operation to help him 
walk, plus vital aftercare.

They
hope Corin will be able to have the selective dorsal rhizotomy surgery 
(SDR) that is offered at Frenchay Hospital in Bristol.

Cash
from their charity fundraiser was stored at the Shireway Community 
Centre in Yate - but two thieves forced their way in at 2.15am on August
20.

Cashing in: The heartless duo broke into Shireway Community Centre in Yate and stole about £1,400 collected for the Corin's First Steps appeal

The pair, dressed in hooded tops to 
conceal their faces, cracked open a safe and took more than £8,000 in 
cash - including £1,400 towards Corin's appeal.

Support
worker Miss Weeks, who gve birth to her second child, Inaya, 11 weeks 
ago, said: 'We believe the thieves might have known the money was there.

'It is horrible to think that they 
might have been at our charity event on the Saturday, then took the 
money from Corin two days later.

'This operation is really important for Corin's quality of life and it is vital for his future that he has it.'

Corin's
operation will cut some of the nerves in the spinal cord to overcome 
the tightening of muscles that makes it difficult for people with some 
forms of cerebral palsy to walk.

While
surgery is available at Frenchay Hospital, seven miles away from the 
family's home, it is not routinely available on the NHS and local health
trusts do not tend to pay for it.

The family have been told it is 
unlikely they will get funding and they are waiting to find out whether 
Corin will be able to have the procedure at Frenchay for about £23,000.

If not, they will have to go to the USA - where it would cost considerably more.

The community has been left sickened after the pair forced the safe open and made off the with the life-changing money

The couple, who have raised £28,000 for Corin's operation through their appeal, were delighted when another Bristol charity stepped in to replace the stolen cash.

Scott Wright, who runs a charity helping children and families effected by cerebral palsy, and his fiancee Melissa, heard what had happened and felt compelled to help out.

He said: 'When I saw the story it made me sick to the stomach. It almost felt personal because my brother has the same condition.

'I cannot imagine what it felt like to put in all the effort and raise all that money, only for some vile toe-rags to steal it.'

Police are still hunting the pair responsible for the cruel raid.

Neighbourhood Insp Andy Workman, from Avon and Somerset Police, said: 'The community has really pulled together to raise this cash for Corin and his family.

'I am sure anyone with information about who is responsible for taking this money and causing so much damage to a valued community centre will come forward to help.'
