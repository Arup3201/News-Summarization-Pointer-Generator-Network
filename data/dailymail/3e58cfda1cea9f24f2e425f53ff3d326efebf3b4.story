A feng shui master was buried alive in a landslide at a Chinese cemetery seconds after showing a family a 'perfect burial plot' for their relative's grave.

The family of recently deceased De Meng, 75, had invited the feng shui master Zheng Guoqiang, 55, to visit the cemetery in Zhaoqing, Guangdong to see which plot of land could be regarded as 'good land' for a family grave where De Meng could be buried.

After surveying the site he took the six members of the man's family to a place where he announced the vibrations and location was perfect for the grave.

Zheng Guoqiang was regarded as one of the most famous feng shui experts in Hong Kong but was buried alive

According to the one person who survived, seconds later there was a landslide which buried all seven people, leaving six of them dead.

Zheng Guoqiang was regarded as one of the most famous feng shui experts in Hong Kong and was frequently asked about his opinion.

In a city where land is so scarce, many feel it is important to make the right choice when choosing an area for a project, whether that is building a property or finding a site for a grave.

Feng shui is widely used in China to orient buildings including tombs in an auspicious manner.

Depending on the particular style of feng shui being used, a favourable site could be determined by reference to local features such as water, stars, or via a compass.

Feng shui was suppressed in mainland China during the cultural revolution in the 1960s but since then has increased in popularity.
