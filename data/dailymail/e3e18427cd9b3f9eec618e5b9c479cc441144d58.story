Comedian Stephen Colbert got in some trouble with Wikipedia after he instructed his loyal fans to make unnecessary edits to the pages of Mitt Romney's possible vice presidential candidates in an effort to sway their viability.

In response, Wikipedia took the unusual step of locking the pages of the majority of Romney's short list, meaning that only experienced Wikipedia users had the ability to alter the information.

The internet kerfuffle came after political bloggers noted the trend that the number of recent edits made to the pages of potential nominees could be used to gauge how likely it is that said candidate will be Romney's choice.

Rebel rouser: Stephen Colbert urged his viewers to make as many edits as they could to sway the vote

Watching his every move: Political analysts are dying to know who Mitt Romney- seen here headed to New York on Wednesday- will pick for his vice presidential running mate

An article on the site Tech President 
examined the trend that started in the days leading up to the 
announcement of vice presidential candidates in the last presidential 
election: shortly before Sarah Palin and Joe Biden were revealed as 
their respective parties' vice presidential nominees, there was a major 
spike in the edits to their pages.

Political blogs picked up on the idea,
read into the virtual tea leaves, which lead to Colbert encouraging his
viewers to take the race into their own hands.

New York Magazine reports that the comedian told his viewers to 'make
as many edits as possible to your favorite VP contender' and spent time
during Tuesday night's show with a bit about him editing former 
Minnesota governor Tim Pawlenty's page.

A short while later, Wikipedia locked 
the pages of Pawlenty, Senator Rob Portman, Congressman Paul Ryan, 
Senator Marco Rubio, Governor Bobby Jindal, Governor Chris Christie and 
General David Petraeus, all of whom have been at the top of many 
speculative lists.

Politico blogger Dylan Byers said that
while he initially endorsed the validity of theory about the Wikipedia 
edits guiding post, further inspection proved that a number of the edits
were done by the same sources, not all of which were substantive. 
Colbert's shout out was inevitably going to drive up that traffic even 
further.

By blocking the pages to new users, 
Wikipedia still left a way for people who they consider 'experienced' to
make their contributions to the open sourced encyclopedia.

Frontrunner: Seen here with Mitt Romney on Tuesday, New Hampshire Senator Kelly Ayotte (right) had the most edits on her Wikipedia page out of all of the potential VP candidates

Anyone who reaches the status of an 
'autoconfirmed user'- which means they have had an account on the site 
for at least four days and made more than 10 edits- they will have the 
ability to make changes on the protected pages again.

Even Wikipedia admits that this system
still allows for a large number of contributors, many of whom may have 
an ulterior motive.

'Although the precise requirements for
autoconfirmed status vary according to circumstances, most English Wiki
user accounts that are more than four days old and have made at least 
10 edits are considered autoconfirmed,' they say on their access levels 
page.

Trailing behind: Marco Rubio had 100 edits on Tuesday (left), Rob Portman had 81 (center) and Paul Ryan had 57 (right) putting them all behind Ayotte but the system of analysis is also flawed

The correlation between the number of 
edits and a possible announcement was first noticed in 2008 as members 
of their campaigns who added more information to their profiles in the 
hours before their names were going to be searched thoroughly by 
Americans hoping to learn more about the candidates.

For instance, Sarah Palin's page had 
68 edits the day before her nomination was announced, while other 
prospects- which, at the time, included Romney himself- had far fewer 
changes on that fateful day.

Additionally, there is the ever-important aspect of context that has to be applied to the situation.

When Palin was added to the ticket, 
she was essentially unknown to all Americans outside of Alaska where she
was part-way through her first term. As a result, it comes as no 
surprise that John McCain's campaign staff wanted to add a significant 
amount of information to her biography before putting her in front of 
the electorate.

Trendsetters: The system of looking through Wikipedia edits for clues came with Sarah Palin's selection in 2008 (above) but she also was less well-known than all of Romney's current candidates

The same cannot be said for Rubio, 
Portman or Ayotte, all of whom have been under the political microscope 
for the past few months in wake of their connections to Romney.

While the edit tally may not prove to 
be accurate guiding posts for the vice presidential slot, the Romney 
campaign continues to push for people to download their free app which 
will deliver the news first once it breaks.

Another tried-and-tested method would be to follow the money.

Politico reported Tuesday that Portman
is expected to rake in over $500,000 for the Romney ticket from two 
Ohio fundraisers this week, which would be a positive argument in favor 
of his candidacy.

At the same time, Florida-based 
Republican Hispanic coordinator Ana Navarro Tweeted an anonymous tip 
that the Romney’s first joint appearance with his vice presidential 
partner will be in St. Petersburg, foreshadowing that the candidate is 
likely from the Sunshine State, (meaning Rubio).

It is likely that such rumor-mongering
will go on for a number of days yet as many expect that the formal 
announcement won’t come until after the Olympics finish in order to make
the best use of the inevitable media attention.
