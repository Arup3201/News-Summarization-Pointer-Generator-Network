Shocking new video has emerged of the minutes after an asthmatic, obese man was put in a chokehold that may have killed him - and the cop responsible has had his gun and badge stripped.

Eric Garner, 43, died shortly after he was thrown to the ground and choked-out by NYPD officers outside the Staten Island store in which he worked. This new footage shows him unresponsive on the ground for several minutes before help arrives.

The video picks up where another disturbing video left off, with the man seemingly unconscious after the violent arrest.

Unresponsive: Eric Garner appears unconscious and is barely breathing to the point an officer checks his pulse

Officers Daniel Pantaleo and Justin Damico have since been placed on desk duty, with eight-year veteran Pantaleo forced to hand in his gun and badge, according to the New York Daily News, which originally made the original video public.

The second video shows Garner on his side on the ground as a crowd builds around him. Police first try to make the person capturing the footage leave, but they do not.

Cops try to talk with Garner, but he does not respond - his eyes are closed and his head droops onto the sidewalk.

They openly wonder if he still has a pulse, and one officer presses his fingers to Garner's neck and says he does.

People keep asking why they aren't doing CPR, and paramedics do not arrive for over three minutes.

The paramedic tries communicating with Garner: 'We're here to help.'

But he does not answer.

The paramedic checks his pulse and says he's still alive, then decides he needs to go on a stretcher.

Still not alert, Garner is rolled over and at least six cops, plus the paramedic, hoist him on to a stretcher.

Another person asks again why no CPR was performed.

'Because he's still breathing,' and officer snaps at the person.

Despite Garner's dire medical condition being apparent to the still-building crowd, many cops stand around casually talking with each other, some can even be heard laughing.

The officer who put Garner in the chokehold amazingly waves to the camera as Garner is wheeled away.

The damning footage came to light the same day his widow spoke publicly for the first time of her horror at seeing a video of her dead husband's arrest.

Esaw Garner said she was deeply upset by the footage.

The mother-of-six collapsed in tears at a Saturday press conference.

The officer believed to have used the chokehold, who has not yet been identified, may lose his job, a law enforcement source said.

'It violates protocol. It violates a direct rule which is never to put somebody in a choke hold,' the unidentified source told the New York Post.

Earlier footage released Friday shows one officer put Garner in a chokehold - a maneuver barred under NYPD practice code - while police tried to arrest him over claims he was selling bootleg cigarettes.

Garner's wife watched footage of the arrest, and her 43-year-old husband's final moments on a sidewalk, on Friday. 

'They killed him. They choked him and took him down and I could hear him screaming that he couldn’t breathe,' she told the Daily News, which has an exclusive copy of the film.

'It was so hard to watch. He was a non-violent gentle giant, and they killed him.'

The 46-year-old was comforted by the Reverend Al Sharpton at the Saturday press conference held by Sharpton's National Action Network.

She sobbed uncontrollably as Sharpton described the circumstances of her husband's death.

'The issue is not if one was selling [untaxed] cigarettes, the issue is that an unarmed man was subjected to a chokehold and the result is he is no longer with us,' Sharpton said.

Sharpton then joined the family on a peaceful demonstration through Staten Island, to protest the circumstances of Garner's death.

In the video Garner, who was not armed, is heard denying that he has been involved in illegal activity when a plainclothes police officer accosted him.

'Every time you see me you want to mess with me. I’m tired of it. It stops today!' Garner griped.

When he is put on the ground by five cops while 
being handcuffed, Garner was yelling out that he couldn't breathe, 
according to several witnesses who watched the arrest.

'They jumped him and they were choking 
him. He was foaming at the mouth. And that's it. He was done,' Ramsey Orta, who took the
 video, told The Daily News.

New York Mayor Bill de Blasio has postponed a family trip to Italy to ensure the investigation gets underway.

In a statement released Friday, he extended his sympathy to the victim's family, and promised a 'full and thorough investigation'.

'We have a responsibility to keep every New Yorker safe, and that includes when individuals are in custody of the NYPD,' de Blasio said.

Confrontation: Eric Garner was stopped by police on this sidewalk

After the incident, posters saying 'no justice, no peace' 'and Another innocent black man has been killed by police brutality. The NYPD must be stopped!' appeared in the area. 

The Rev Lloyd Land, from the First United Christian Church, told Staten Island Live: 'He was a gentle giant. Insofar as violence, I don't believe if you smack him in the face he would hit you back ... The police have no reason to attack him.'
