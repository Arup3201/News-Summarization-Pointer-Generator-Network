If you’re a woman looking for love then your best bet is to head to the City of London, because it has more single men than anywhere else in England and Wales.

The capital’s financial hub has 155 single men per 100 single women.

If you’re a man searching for romance your best chance of success may be in Knowsley, Merseyside, because it boasts the most single women, according to a new survey, with 120 per 100 single men.

Singleton hotspot: The capital¿s financial hub has 155 single men per 100 single women

1 City of London 155 single men for 100 single women

2 Newham 126

3 Isles of Scilly 119

4 Cambridge 117

5 Forest Heath 117

6 Stafford 116

7 Southampton 116

8 Copeland 115

9 Tower Hamlets 115

10 Eden 114

Online dating website eHarmony, which has mapped out Britain’s singleton hotspots, claims the capital, however, is rife with single women with six boroughs in the top ten, while three boroughs are in the top ten for single men.

Enfield, taking the No2 spot, has 116 single females for 100 single men, Wandsworth 114, Barking and Dagenham 113, Bromley 113, Croydon 111 and Hammersmith and Fulham 111.

Meanwhile, the London borough of Newham comes in second for the most amount of single men, with 126 per 100 single females – and Tower Hamlets has the ninth-most, with 115.

Other areas with more men than women are Cambridge, Forest Heath, Stafford, Southampton, Copeland and Eden.

But overall single men tend to congregate in the countryside while single women are to be found in the town and cities.

The report also reveals that overall young single women aged between 18 and 34 are in shorter supply than young single men, primarily because women enter relationships younger than men on average.

This means much of the pool of young women are living with men in the older age group, 35-64, and are therefore not ‘single.’

Young men have the best chance of finding young single women in the city, where there are 88 young single women for every 100 young men as opposed to 81 in rural areas.

The figures also reveal a ‘doughnut effect’ around London specifically, with a higher ratio of single women living in the outer boroughs such as Enfield, Bromley, Barking and Dagenham, and Croydon but a higher ratio of single men in the middle.

The report forecasts that the singles gap in rural areas could widen over the next decade, as increasing numbers of country-based women pursue urban careers and higher earnings.

It was based on estimating the number of single men and women aged between 18 and 64 in different local area districts.

Crucially, the analysis does not include couples who do not live together, previously recorded as 'single' in data published by the Office for National Statistics.

EHarmony's Romain Bertrand said: ‘Meeting that special someone can be tough.

‘With busier lives than ever it can be hard to find the time to get out there and meet people, and sometimes it's a case of simply not being in the right place at the right time.

‘That's where online dating can really make a difference. We know it can be hard for some people to meet a special someone and we wanted to explore the reasons behind this, including location.

‘Regardless of where you live, eHarmony delivers its members quality matches within a distance they feel comfortable with.

‘As the pay-gap between men and women shrinks over the next decade, driving a higher number of females to pursue careers in cities, we expect the 'singles gap' to get even bigger - with even more single women in urban areas, and conversely less in rural communities.

‘As a result, single men in rural areas and single women in urban areas will increase proportionally and we believe many will solve this issue through online dating.

‘As the 'singles gap' grows, the odds will become increasingly stacked against single men and women who live in certain areas, who simply have less people to choose from than those living elsewhere.

‘This combined with increasingly hectic work and social lives mean that online relationship sites, such as eHarmony, become an increasingly important means to find a partner.

‘In fact, our research shows that more than half of all couples will meet online by 2031.’
