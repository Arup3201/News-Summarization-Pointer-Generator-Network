An historic plantation has been destroyed after it was allegedly set on fire by a gang of men on a drug-fueled 'ghost hunt'.

Seven men have reportedly admitted burning down the landmark in the early hours of Friday morning after breaking in to look for ghosts and smoke marijuana.

The home, which was built in the 1850s near the Mississippi River levee in Old Arabi, was one of just two surviving plantation buildings in Arabi, south of New Orleans.

Destroyed: The historic LeBeau plantation, south of New Orleans, was destroyed by fire in the early hours of Friday

Arrests: The fire was allegedly started by seven men who went to the house on a drug-fueled ghost hunt

Ruins: A charred shell is all that is left of the building which dates back to the 1850s

Suspects: The seven suspects charged in connection with the fire line up next to the sheriff's van after their arrest

Dusten Davenport, 31, Joshua Allen, 21, Joshua Briscoe, 20, Joseph Landin, 20, and a 17-year-old have all been charged with arson and simple burglary and criminal damage.

Two other men, Kevin Barbe, 20, and Bryon Meek, 29, have been charged with accessory to arson. Barbe has also been charged with criminal trespassing.

St Bernard Sheriff James Pohlmann said: 'They were in there looking for ghosts, drinking, smoking dope, and for some reason they made a decision - a conscious decision - before they left to set this building on fire.'

He said that the men were door-to-door salesmen.

Before: How the historic house had looked before Friday's fire

Gone: Very little remains of the house which has been used as a hotel and illegal casino over the years

The land was first used as a plantation in 1721 and remained as a plantation for the next century or so.

For around 30 years in the early 19th century, the land was used as a brickyard.

Work began on the house itself when Francoise Barthelemy LeBeau bought the land in 1851.

Although it had sixteen rooms, the LeBeau home only had one interior staircase for tax reasons.

The building was completed in 1854, but Mr LeBeau died a few months later.

The house remained in the LeBeau family until 1905 when it was bought by Friscoville Realty and it was turned into the Friscoville Hotel.

Burning: Smoke billows from the building as fire crews begin to dampen down the flames on Friday morning

Security: The owners of the building had installed a security fence around it, but that didn't deter the group of seven men who broke in

The hotel changed hands again in 1928 when it was bought by Jai Alai Realty and renamed the Cardone Hotel.

Although it was a hotel by name, the house was reportedly used as an illegal casino - gun turrets built in closets during the prohibition days were said to have survived until Friday's fire.

LeBeau house was bought by Joseph Meraux in 1967 but deteriorated badly.

A fire damaged the building in 1986 and attempts to restore it continually started but then failed.

It wasn't until 2003 that the building was stabilised, but the devastation of Hurricane Katrina in the area put paid to further restoration plans.

It is thought that plans were in the pipeline to carry out further work on the home.

According to reports, locals had for many years reported seeing a light go on and off in the cupola of the house despite there being no electrical connection.

Emergency operation: Firefighters pictured at the scene of the fire on Friday morning

LeBeau house had been owned by the Meraux Foundation which described Friday's fire as a 'tragedy'.

In a statement, the foundation said: 'We are deeply saddened by the loss of one of our community's most beloved treasures.

'Over the years we have wrestled with determining the best use for the plantation.

'One of our duties as board members is to prioritize our actions in response to community needs.

'Given the millions of dollars required to restore the plantation, prudence dictated that we preserve the plantation while we worked to identify the best path forward.

'The Foundation hired an architect who specializes in historic buildings and spent hundreds of thousands of dollars on structural improvements and routine maintenance.

'We made our best efforts to secure the land from trespassers. We installed an eight foot fence around the property and posted signs.

'But it is doubtful that anything short of 24 hour patrols would have kept out these intruders intent on engaging in illegal activities.'
