Colin Montgomerie has told the new regime at the European Tour that they must prioritise finding a way to lure Rory McIlroy back to this side of the Atlantic, even if it means competition organisers spending more on appearance fees.

The absence of McIlroy is a leading discussion point in Turkey this week, with the Northern Irishman choosing not to contest the penultimate event of the European calendar.

His lead of close to three million points in the Race to Dubai is so great that one of Wales’s Jamie Donaldson, Sergio Garcia or Marcel Siem could win both here at the Turkish Airlines Open and the season-finale in Dubai next week and still not catch him if he finishes top five in the desert.

That prospect is so unlikely that Montgomerie would like to see the European Tour – on which he will contest his 600th event in Turkey – consider introducing points-heavy finale to the season, as they do in the PGA Tour’s FedEx Cup series.

He also believes that the wider issue of bringing McIlroy to Europe more during the season should be high on the agenda for the next European Tour chief executive after George O’Grady steps down.

Asked if he thought financial incentives would be a good idea, Montgomerie said: ‘Very good. I think the new CEO of our tour has to be very careful about our stars, our Ryder Cup players, the stars of our tour, playing full time somewhere else.

‘We've got to be quite careful here. The first thing a sponsor asks is “who's playing?” And too many times, too often, nine or 10 of our Ryder Cup Team are playing full time in America, and we have to address that. The new CEO of the Tour has to address that and Rory McIlroy is part of that.

‘We have to have more of our stars playing more in Europe more of the time. That's a big, big first job of the CEO to try and address that situation. How, I don't know how that's done, because I'm not of the job.

‘There's too many of our stars playing in America and not enough American stars playing over here. That would be No 1 (priority).’

Montgomerie tees up at the Turkish Airlines Open on Thursday after a stunning year on the Senior Tour, in which he won two Majors. He returns to competition against what he terms ‘the flat bellies’ with the claim that his form this season reached the levels of his Mid Nineties prime.

The 51-year-old said: ‘I believe I've played as well as I did, or almost as well as I did, in the Nineties. I really have performed as well as I would like to have done.

‘I think I'm enjoying the game more than I did. I don't know if I enjoyed the game (earlier in his career). It was more of a job. Now I'm actually enjoying the game.’
