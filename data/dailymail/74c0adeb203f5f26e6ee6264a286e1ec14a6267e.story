Arsenal’s interest in Virgil van Dijk will have heightened further after the Celtic defender indicated he must talk to Premier League clubs if they bid for him this month.

The Holland Under 21 international looks as if will head south from Glasgow at the end of the season but is open to offers in January.

While he insists that Celtic’s refusal to let him leave unless major money comes their way is no problem for now, Van Dijk pointed at his age as reason to move on.

‘I have recently been thinking a bit about it [his career],’ Van Dijk told De Telegraaf.

‘I am now 23 and have played at Willem II, FC Groningen and Celtic and am now linked to clubs like Arsenal. Isn’t that great?

‘There are a lot of clubs interested, but Celtic is holding on to a big transfer fee. The club is clear: they don’t want to let me go in the winter, because we’re playing for four trophies.

‘I understand the point of view from the club and I see it as a compliment that they don’t want to let me go. But we have to be realistic.

‘If there’s a nice club from England, we have to talk. I want to develop myself as a player, that’s for sure.’

Sunderland and Everton are also closely monitoring the situation, with Celtic asking for upwards of £10million for Van Dijk.
