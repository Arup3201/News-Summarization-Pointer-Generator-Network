Two California families have suffered heartbreaking losses as four people - including two children - were killed in a horrific head-on crash on Saturday.

The tragic accident occurred on Highway 50 in El Dorado County, near Placerville.

The crash was caused as a westbound Toyota Prius driven by 38-year-old Sheng Kun Su veered into the path of a minivan and the vehicles collided head-on.

Passenger Shu Zhen Zhao, 39, and their eight-year-old son Shawn Su, were also killed, according to the Sacramento Bee.

Patrol Sgt Gilbert Lee said a 4-year-old in the minivan, identified as Nora Elizabeth Temple, also lost her life in the horrific crash.

Lee said that four others in the minivan, including Nora’s one-year-old twin brothers - John Maxwell Temple and John James Temple - were not injured.

Elly Aili Su, 10, a daughter of Su and Zhao, also survived the crash.

The police investigation of the incident has been hampered by the fact that no witnesses to the accident have come forward.

Sgt Jim Byers of the El Dorado County Sheriff’s Department told CBS Sacramento: 'It was an unwitnessed accident. We don’t have anybody who actually saw it happen.'

Officers have raised the possibility that the crash may have been caused by the Prius trying to avoid hitting a deer.

Most area car crashes in the month of November involve hitting deer, which are currently in their mating season.

Officer Quinn Cuthbertson of the California Highway Patrol told KTXL-TV that the best course of action would be to hit a deer instead of trying to swerve around it.
