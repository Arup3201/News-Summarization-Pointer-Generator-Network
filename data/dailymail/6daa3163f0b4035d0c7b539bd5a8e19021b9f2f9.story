Jailed: Former Ukip candidate David Evans has been jailed for four months over the deaths of 260 sheep

A former Ukip candidate has been jailed for four months over the deaths of 260 sheep after some were found rotting in his fields.

Police found 119 dead animals on David Evans' farm in Cornwall in what one animal welfare officer described as the most sickening case of neglect he had ever seen.

Their bodies were left decomposing in the field while many others were discovered rotting after being dumped in waste bags.

A further 141 sheep were then found languishing in squalid and sodden conditions and were so badly emaciated, they had to be put down.

Evans, 71, was deselected as Ukip’s parliamentary candidate for the Camborne and Redruth seat in Cornwall last month, after he admitted animal welfare charges.

He appeared before Bodmin Magistrates Court yesterday where district judge Kevin Gray jailed him for four months and disqualified him indefinitely from keeping sheep.

Mike Brown, defending, immediately lodged an appeal against the sentence but the judge refused to let Evans out on bail while it is decided.

A previous hearing was told how the sheep were kept as pets but were left to fend for themselves after Evans abandoned them over one of the wettest winters on record.

Kingsley Keate, prosecuting, said Cornwall Council dispatched investigators to Trehausa Farm in Week St Mary, owned by Evans on February 6 after a string of complaints.

A team of police and council officials including health inspector Jonathan McCulloch and veterinary officer Sue Potter arrived to find his land strewn with carcasses of sheep and lambs.

Some of the animals were decomposing in paddocks and fields while others had been scooped up and left to rot in bags.

Mr Keate said over a further three visits they located dozens more live animals who were emaciated, suffering from lameness and 'close to death'.

A total of 141 sheep had to be put down in February and March due to their condition.

Mr Keate told the court that Evans treated the flock as pets but they had been 'left out to their own devices to survive a very wet winter'.

He added: 'There was insufficient food, bedding or dry areas for the sheep, which were huddled together and did not have food of the quality which would be expected.

'Sheds which could have housed them were being used to store machinery.'

The court heard that Evans bought the farm in 2001 and brought in sheep to help maintain the grassland.

Mr Brown, defending, said Evans has an extremely high IQ of 130 to 142 but suffers from a form of Asperger’s syndrome that means he struggles to interact with other people.

As he became more reclusive, the former parliamentary candidate started treating the animals as pets but when their numbers swelled to 450 he simply couldn’t cope, Mr Brown added.

Evans admitted six charges including failing to dispose of carcasses and causing unnecessary suffering to sheep by failing to address their emaciation and lameness.

He was also ordered to pay £714.42 in costs.

Speaking after yesterday’s sentencing, health inspector Mr McCulloch said: 'In 15 years this case is by far the worst I have ever experienced.

'Dead sheep were scattered across the farm, new born lambs had died after getting stuck in mud.

'Mr Evans had done very little to ensure the safety of his sheep, his sheds were full of junk so the sheep had no shelter from the weather.

'The lame and emaciated sheep were just ignored.'

A spokesman for the RSPCA added: 'The scenes that greeted the local authority animal health team look appalling.

'Anyone who is responsible for an animal - whether that is one or 100 - has a duty of care for them.

'We are pleased to see the courts take this issue so seriously and sentence the defendant accordingly.'
