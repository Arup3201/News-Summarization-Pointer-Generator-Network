As you’ll know by now, Carl Froch’s spring fight with Julio Cesar Chavez Jnr has been put back because Carl has injured his elbow. It’s heartbreaking for Carl because he desperately wants a Las Vegas fight before he hangs up his gloves, but I am already looking at the possibility of rescheduling for a summer fight against Chavez. Other fights such as Bernard Hopkins and Gennady Golovkin have also been discussed - we will see how it plays out.

From Carl’s point of view, this latest setback is tough to take. We were so close to getting all the details in place for a March 28 fight, but three weeks into training he hurt his elbow. He is the consummate professional and has fought injured before but he won’t make that mistake again, especially for what might be his last bout.

Carl only made the call to postpone last week so now he will take some time to digest that and in the meantime I’m looking at the options. This setback has been frustrating for all of us. I have worked on it for months.

A fight against Gennady Golovkin has been discussed - but money will determine the route he goes down

A Chavez fight still appeals a lot to us and whatever route we go the deal has to be right. That will be key in whatever fight he takes, whether it is against Chavez, Hopkins, Golovkin or anyone else.

Carl is a warrior – everyone knows that. And that is why he would love to fight Golovkin. It would be a fight for the ages but both men would need to be rewarded for that. Those details need to be right. Likewise against Hopkins – they are great names and great fighters but so is Carl so the deal has to suit all parties.

Watch this space because Carl will be going out with a bang. One man waiting in the wings is James Degale, mandatory challenger for Carl’s IBF belt. James is looking to become the first Brit Olympic gold medalist to go on and win a world title - expect a big announcement on his opponent soon and history to be made this spring.

Bernard Hopkins has passed 50 but is showing no signs of slowing down and wants 'at least one more fight'

Kell Brook is set for his big homecoming in Sheffield on March 28. The guy is so excited after everything he has been through and we will announce his opponent on Thursday. I’d back him to beat anyone – Amir Khan included.

The opponent is not totally decided yet. We have been looking at Jo Jo Dan, who is No 1 ranked contender for Kell’s world title. We’ve also looked at Diego Chaves and Josesito Lopez, but there are maybe half a dozen names in the frame.

He has been training hard after what happened in Tenerife and it is great that he is finally closing in on the first defence of his title. I’ll never forget the night he won against Shawn Porter in California – he proved there and then what he can do.

Brook said he was the 'victim of an unprovoked attack' when he was stabbed on holiday last September but is ready for his big homecoming in Sheffield on March 28 but no opponent has been booked as yet 

Eddie Hearn says it's time for Amir Khan (right, punching Devon Alexander) to step up and take the Brook fight

Kell has been sharp and fast in training and he’s also been a keen observer of all that goes on around him in the division. I can understand why Amir Khan has pushed so hard to get a Mayweather fight – if he lost that fight he could brush it off. If he lost to Kell, where does he go from there? It also looks like the deadline Khan set Floyd to accept the fight has passed. So what next?

He knows where we are. He has so much to lose in fighting Kell but is adamant he would win with ease. If he truly believes that then this is the fight that would make him more money than any other.

I offered Khan $5million to take the fight before Kell won a world title. With a world title involved, the pot of money for this fight is even bigger. If Khan truly thinks he could beat Kell, then he should step up.

I would back Kell every day of the week to win that fight. This year is going to be a big year for him and Amir wants the lion share of the pot - we are more than happy to have a 60-40 or 70-30 winner-takes-all deal. In fact, how about winner takes all? It’s big balls time.

I caught up with Deontay Wilder’s win against Bermane Stiverne for the WBC world heavyweight title. I’m pleased for Wilder. He’s a character and a dangerous heavyweight, which is what the American heavyweight scene has lacked.

He also proved his durability and now he has some proper options in front of him, including a rematch with Stiverne, a unification with Wladimir Klitschko or a fight with Britain’s Tyson Fury. That would be a fun event.

Needless to say, we are keeping an eye on what is going on because down the line it will be of interest to our own man, Anthony Joshua, who is well ranked with the WBC. He’s had a setback after picking up a stress fracture in his back, but he will be back out on April 4 in Newcastle and I can reveal here that he will also fight on April 25 at the O2 Arena, hopefully against Kevin Johnson, who he was meant to fight this month before he injured his back.

After that we will look to put him in a big fight at the back end of the summer and then Joshua will be knocking on the door for one of the world titles at the end of the year.

Anthony Crolla is on the mend and we are looking at his options. It is a long road back and hard not to think that he should be preparing for his world-title shot right now.

I am delighted for Derry Mathews to be getting a shot in Ant’s place against Richar Abril for the WBA world lightweight title. Derry is a good guy. Our options thereafter might be a shot at Derry, if he wins, but we are also keeping an eye on the WBO belt. Terence Crawford, the WBO champion, is likely to move up a weight, and we’d be tempted by a fight against Juan Diaz for the title in the summer. I think that can be made.

I caught up with Floyd Mayweather recently and asked him about Manny Pacquiao but as ever he was not giving much away. But it sounds like this fight is closer than ever to happening.

I gather a lot of the details are in place and that it is down to the TV networks to reach an agreement – that’s not a small factor in this sport. Anything can happen.

I believe it’s 50-50 it will go ahead and I think it will be a two-fight plan, with one in May and the other in September. 

Floyd Mayweather's super-fight against Manny Pacquiao is closer than ever to happening 

Pacquiao has set Mayweather a deadline of the end of this month to agree terms on the bout 

The fact that Miguel Cotto’s fight with Saul Alvarez is off might complicate things as he is someone Mayweather would want to fight. But my hope, like everyone else’s, is that the fight with Pacquiao will finally happen. Don’t be surprised if Cotton wins the race though.

It might be a couple of years too late for some but it will break every record that has ever been set in boxing.

It will be an amazing clash of skill versus work rate and speed. I think Mayweather would edge it but it would be very close.
