Kim Kardashian may be the self-proclaimed queen of selfies, but she's got nothing on daredevil photographer Thaigo Correa.

The plucky 27-year-old Brazilian has been snapping extreme self portraits since 2012, and climbed to the top Rio de Janeiro's famous Christ the Redeemer statue for his latest daring photoshoot - with incredible results.

Access to the religious monument is restricted, so Thiago had to gain special permission from the authorities to climb the statue, although his jaw-dropping snaps from the head of the 124ft Brazilian landmark are worth the effort.
