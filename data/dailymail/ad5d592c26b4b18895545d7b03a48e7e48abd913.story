England wing Jack Nowell has agreed terms on a new contract with Aviva Premiership club Exeter.

The Chiefs announced that Nowell's deal would keep him at Sandy Park until 2017.

The 21-year-old made his England debut in the opening game of this season's RBS 6 Nations Championship against France and featured throughout the campaign.

He is currently recovering from knee surgery, though, and will miss out on England's three-Test New Zealand tour that starts in Auckland next Saturday.

'It's fantastic news for us and, along with the likes of Luke Cowan-Dickie, Sam Hill and Dave Ewers, we've now got most of those young guys tied down and committed to the club long term," Exeter head coach Rob Baxter said.

'Jack has had to take every opportunity with two hands, which he has done, and I think it's a great credit to him that when those opportunities have come along he has taken them, not just with Exeter, but with England as well.

'Whether he will be fit for the start of the season, it's still too early to say.

'We will monitor that closely, but ultimately this period will be very good for him as it will allow him to rest up, recuperate and work on an area of concern with his knee which he hasn't been able to do flat-out for a few seasons now.

'Personally, I am really looking forward to getting Jack back fighting fit. He is around the club most days working really hard, being very professional, and I have no doubt we will see an even better Jack Nowell next season.'
