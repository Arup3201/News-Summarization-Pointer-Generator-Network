A former Royal Marine cleared of setting fire to footballer Andy Carroll's Range Rover 'tried to have sex with a car', a court heard.

Rob Curran was caught in a state of undress in broad daylight on a busy street, 'gyrating and thrusting' his groin against the bonnet of a black BMW.

He was spotted by a horrified female witness as she drove down Station Road, in Backworth, North Tyneside.

A court heard that, just an hour before, the 36-year-old had also been loud and abusive in a pub before smashing up the windscreen of the landlord's   car.

Car lover: Rob Curran was caught in broad daylight on a busy street attempting to have sex with a black BMW

Curran was arrested and pleaded guilty to one count of exposure, one public order offence and criminal damage at North Tyneside Magistrates' Court,   where he claimed he couldn't remember anything because he was 'paralytic'.

Rebecca Gibson, prosecuting, told the court the indecent exposure happened at 5.30pm on April 28.

She said: 'The witness was driving through Station Road, which is a busy main road. She noticed a man and thought he looked like he was stretching against a car bonnet, as if he was about to go for a run.

'She looked again and noticed the car was a black BMW, which was parked up. The male was in front of the bonnet.'

Curran was questioned when Andy Carroll's £70,000 chrome-plated 4x4 was set alight outside the home of then Newcastle manager Kevin Nolan. Five months later police told him he would not be charged

In a statement from the witness, she said: 'I then saw the male... he was gyrating and thrusting against the car bonnet. I thought, "The dirty b******,   he's having sex with the car".

'I couldn't believe a man would stand in public, fully thrusting against the bonnet of a vehicle.'

The court heard the witness drove on and saw an unsuspecting mother and young child walking towards Curran.

After returning home to get her mother and brother, she went back to Station Road but found the car gone and Curran, previously of Jesmond, Newcastle,   but now living at Holmlands, Whitley Bay, sitting fully clothed on a nearby wall.

Drunk: Hours before the incident with the car, Curran had smashed the windscreen of a pub landlord's car

Curran was arrested and it was soon revealed that, just an hour earlier, he had entered the Black Horse Inn, in Monkseaton, North Tyneside, and become   loud and aggressive before throwing a charity box at the bar.

Mrs Gibson said: 'He then picked-up a bar stool and went outside. The landlord, James Read, heard a large smash and saw the defendant by his car, a Citroen Berlingo, where he threw the bar stool to the ground and   walked away.

'Mr Read saw the windscreen of his vehicle had been smashed. The damage cost £216.'

Mark Harrison, defending, said Curran was deeply remorseful for what he'd done. He said: 'The police didn't consider this sinister behaviour. They   described it more as drunk stupidity.

'I don't ever recall a more embarrassed, ashamed and remorseful individual. He hasn't stopped apologising.

'There had been a fractious breakdown of the friendship between Mr Curran and the publican. He accepted there had been a   disagreement and, in the spur of the moment, doing damage to the car.

'What happened later, was frankly unbelievable. He can't put an explanation to it because he can't remember it.'

The court also heard Curran suffered from post-traumatic stress disorder from his time in the Marines.

Magistrates adjourned sentencing for the preparation of reports.

The former security specialist also spent five months behind bars in 2012 for crashing his car head-on into a taxi and brandishing knives in a village   pub.

Curran served with the Royal Marines for eight years, before commanding a six-figure salary protecting the wealthy and influential all over the world.

He was in a relationship with the mother of former Newcastle player Carroll’s child, Faye Johnstone and the striker’s ex-partner, Stacey Miller.

Carroll, who now plays for West Ham, started seeing Ms Johnstone after she split from Curran.

Then in July 2010 the footballer began dating Ms Miller, just weeks after she separated from Curran, reports the Evening Chronicle.

Curran was arrested and questioned when striker’s £70,000 chrome-plated 4x4 was set alight outside the home of then Newcastle manager Kevin Nolan three months later.

He was released on bail and five months later police told him he would not be charged.
