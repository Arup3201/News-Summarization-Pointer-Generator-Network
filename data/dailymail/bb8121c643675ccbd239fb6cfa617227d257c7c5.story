Liverpool boss Brendan Rodgers hopes injured striker Daniel Sturridge will be ready for a return to action in early January. 

The England star has not played for Liverpool since August after suffering thigh and calf problems, depriving Brendan Rodgers of his first-choice striker after the departure of Luis Suarez.

Sturridge has been training in Los Angeles because the club thought that he would benefit from a change of scenery.

Sturridge's latest injury was not connected to the one he suffered while on England duty in September

Ankle ligaments - England v Republic of Ireland May 2013, returned for pre-season.

Ankle ligaments - December 2013. Missed nine games.

Thigh - during England training, September 2014. Missed six weeks.

Calf - during Liverpool training, October 2014. Missed three weeks.

Thigh - during Liverpool training, November 2014. Out for six weeks (min)

Asked when the striker would return, Rodgers said: 'That will be just after the Christmas period.'

'The first stage of his rehab was in Los Angeles, he's gone to Boston and he will move on to a specialist facility there and hopefully in the early part of the new year he will be back.

'Some point in January we will get him back and that will be really exciting for this team.' 

The 25-year-old was injured just three games into the new season when he suffered a thigh strain in September while training with England for the Euro 2016 qualifier against Switzerland.

Sturridge pulled a calf muscle in his first full training session back with Liverpool’s first-team in October and then picked up a fresh thigh injury in November that has ruled him out until the new year.
