Stacey Broll still relives the terrifying moment when Jodhi Meares' 2.5 tonne Range Rover became airborne and hurtled towards her and boyfriend Josh Grossman as they took a quiet Saturday night drive to get ice cream.

Ms Broll claims if she hadn't made a split second decision to swerve into the next lane  which happened to be empty, the couple, both aged 21, might be dead or injured and Meares, 43, would have either ended up in hospital or lost her life.

Ms Broll is still angry about the accident and is demanding an apology from Meares, who has yet to speak to her in the month since.

Ms Meares will face Waverley Local Court on August 5 charged with charged with high range drink driving and with driving while her licence was suspended in relation to the Saturday night smash.

The fashion designer, who was once married to billionaire James Packer, and is now engaged to rock star, Jon Stevens, was allegedly almost four times over the legal blood alcohol limit when she was driving the car.

Physiotherapy student Stacey Broll, 21, was behind the wheel of her silver Rav4 four wheel drive (pictured) in traffic on the night of June 21 in Sydney's eastern Suburbs  when designer Jodhi Meares careened around the corner in her $200,000 Range Rover Sport, smashing into five cars. The 2.5 tonne vehicle then became airborne and hurtled towards Ms Broll and boyfriend Josh Grossman. She managed to swerve her car into the next lane which was thankfully empty, but believes she, Mr Grossman and Jodhi Meares might all have been dead if the vehicles had collided. She thinks Meares is 'selfish' for driving after allegedly drinking almost four times the legal limit and should apologise

Ms Broll said Meares (pictured, right, at a 2011 fashion launch) was curled up in a foetal position between the air bags of her Range Rover Sport and was jittery and 'out of it'

Stacey Broll, 21, says Jodhi Meares should say sorry to her and boyfriend Josh Grossman for nearly crashing into them, and to the owners of the five cars she smashed and the people who helped her out of her $200,000 Range Rover Sport after it flipped on its side on the night of June 21 in Sydney's Eastern Suburbs

Neighbour Craig Russell took this photo of Jodhi Meares' Range Rover Sport lying on its side with the designer still in the front seat after hearing a 'massive bang' and running to the window of his apartment above O'Sullivan Road, Rose Bay in Sydney's east. Some of the cars Ms Meares' vehicle smashed into she careened around the corner at high speed can be seen in the photograph

'Jodhi should apologise to all of us who were there, the people whose cars she smashed into, the people who helped her out of the car, the neighbours who ran out to help.

'I don't know what would have happened if I hadn't swerved . Her car is a monster. It could have crushed mine.

'It landed half way in the lane which I'd been in before I swerved. We were just so lucky there wasn't another car in the left lane.

'I guess I remember it now like it was in slow motion, but it all happened so fast. 

Stacey Broll (pictured, with the car she was driving when Jodhi Meares almost smashed into it) says she is relieved she managed to pull out of the way of Meares' 'monster' Range Rover, but she still relives the moment and says an 'irresponsible and selfish' Meares should get on Facebook or Twitter and apologise to her and others at the scene

Rock star Jon Stevens (pictured, left) was not in the car when Jodhi Meares (right, at a 2012 fashion function) crashed her Range Rover but afterwards, Stacey Broll says, she heard Meares insisting to police 'I've got to call my husband'. When she did make the call, Ms Broll now presumes to fiance Stevens, the couple seemed to argue. Then police placed her under arrest and took her off to a police station where she allegedly blew 0.181, almost four times over the legal limit

Emergency crews attend the scene of the June 21 crash by fashion designer Jodhi Meares on O'Sullivan Road, Rose Bay in which her vehicle smashed into five cars, became airborne and landed on its side.

'I was scared to look because I was certain she was dead, but then I saw her curled in a fetal position behind the steering wheel.

'She probably doesn't know who we are and she's rich, so maybe she'll be treated differently.

'But she was selfish to drive when she was so drunk and irresponsible. She's lucky nobody is dead.'

On June 21 this year, Ms Broll, a physiotherapy student who works as a receptionist  at a gym, was visiting boyfriend Josh, a building certifier, from her home at St Ives, on Sydney's Upper North Shore.

It was a Saturday night and Ms Broll had been at the gym and her boyfriend out fishing when she convinced him  to accompany her on a drive to an ice cream shop at nearby Bondi Beach after 9.30pm.

Wreckage: smashed cars (left) and Jodhi Meares' upturned Range Rover Sport (right) pictured after the June 21 crash in Sydney's Eastern Suburbs. Physiotherapy student, Stacey Broll, who was driving with boyfriend Josh Grossman when Meares' car flipped and would have hit her vehicle, had Ms Broll not swerved out of the way, says Ms Meares owes her an apology

Ms Broll was behind the wheel of her silver RAV4, a small four wheel drive, and had turned into O'Sullivan Road in Rose Bay, in Sydney's eastern suburbs and were braking towards a red light when a black Range Rover Sport careened around the corner from New South Head Road at high speed and smashed into a parked car.

'It was like a domino effect,' Ms Broll said, 'after she hit the first car, five cars all smashed into each other and the impact sent her car into the air towards us.

Jodhi Meares was 'jittery' as she smoked and waited while police surveyed the wreckage following the accident on the night of June 21, in which Ms Meares smashed into five vehicles and then flipped her own car on O'Sullivan Road, Rose Bay, in the eastern surburbs of Sydney, narrowly missing 21-year-old student Stacey Broll and her boyfriend Josh Grossman in their much smaller car

'After I swerved out of the way, her car flipped onto its side. Josh and I got out and I said out loud, "they're definitely dead".'

Ms Broll said her heart was thumping and she was in shock. She did not at first know who was behind the wheel of the $200,000 vehicle. Mr Grossman immediately called police.

'And then there were neighbours rushing out, people running out of the shops near the corner.

'A girl knew who works at Jimmy Brings came out. Her car was one of those that got smashed. She was really shocked, we all were.

'I saw her with her knees on her chest up behind an air bag. Her eyes were wide open. She looked frightened.'

Ms Broll said  a group of men 'manoeuvred' Ms Meares away from the driver's side of the car, on which the vehicle was sitting and pulled her out.

'The first thing she did was get a cigarette. She was jittery and out of it and kept on saying, "I need to call my husband". 

Then the police came and they were trying to calm her down and kept on saying, "sit down Jodhi" or "come here Jodhi". She didn't seem to know what to do.

"I didn't know at that stage she was Jodhi Meares. I just thought she was an Eastern Suburbs soccer mum.

'The police told us she was drunk.'

Ms Broll said she heard Ms Meares phone her 'husband' - who she now assumes was fiance, Jon Stevens - and proceeded to have an argument over the phone.

'It sounded like the other person at the end of the phone was angry,' she said. 'Jodhi was very tense.'

Police asked Ms Broll to move her car and then to return to the scene so they could interview both she and Mr Grossman as witnesses.

In the month since the crash, Ms Broll said she had thought often of what might have happened if she hadn't got out of the way of Ms Meares' car, and she had also thought about ther owners of the smashed cars.

'There are heaps of ramifications. There might be insurance, but people have lives and are busy and have to get on with things.

'She owns Tiger Lily. She's rich she's still friends with James Packer. Why doesn't she just issue an apology?"She could do it on Facebook or Twitter to all the people who were there, especially the owners of the cars she smashed into.

'She gave me a hell of a fright. She needs to show us some respect.'

Ms Broll watched officers take Ms Meares off in a police car.

At Waverley police station, police say Ms Meares recorded a 0.181 blood alcohol reading, almost four times the legal limit.

She was charged with drink driving and driving while suspended. The maximum penalty for high-range drink driving is a $3300 fine and an 18-month jail sentence.

Ms Meares is due to face Waverley Local Court on August 5.

Phone calls to Ms Meares' fashion label's Sydney store went unanswered on Thursday.
