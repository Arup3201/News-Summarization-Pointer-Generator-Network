When Patrick and Rose Roach lost their wedding album just weeks after tying the knot in 1952, they were understandably devastated.

After decades of being without their treasured memento, the couple - both in their 80s - had given up all hope of ever seeing it again.

But today, that all changed after the devoted couple were reunited with their long-lost photographs  after the album was found in a rubbish skip.

Thrilled: Patrick and Rose Roach's wedding album has been found in a skip over 60 miles away from where they live - 61 years after they lost it

Happy: Mr Roach and his 85-year-old wife had not seen the treasured memento since they somehow lost it in just weeks after their wedding. They are pictured on their wedding day

Mr Roach, 84, said: 'We found it quite amazing we got it back, we had some pictures but this was the original.

'I can’t believe it has come back 
after 61 years of marriage and the condition is not too bad at all, the 
photographs are still quite new.

'The leather cover is a bit damaged 
but not bad considering how old it has and that it was found in a skip, 
you would think it would be ruined.'

Mr Roach and his 85-year-old wife had not seen the wedding album since they somehow lost it in just weeks after their wedding.

Kind: The photo album was saved from a rubbish skip by a builder, Tom Bradley, 83, who put the keepsake in his shed and vowed to find its rightful owners

Found: Mr Bradley's daughter Tina took on the job of attempting to find the album's owners after the Second World War veteran died last month. She sent pictures to a local paper, where relatives of Mr and Mrs Roach recognised the couple, pictured

The couple eventually moved from 
Birmingham to Newcastle-under-Lyme in Staffordshire thinking the
album had been lost forever.

Excited: The long-lost pictures show how the couple could barely contain their happiness on their wedding day

But incredibly, it was saved from a rubbish skip by a builder, Tom Bradley, 83, who put the keepsake in his shed and vowed to find its rightful owners.

In the end, it was his daughter Tina Bradley who took on the job after the Second World War veteran died last month.

She sent pictures to a local paper, where relatives of Mr and Mrs Roach saw them and recognised the couple.

And today, they were finally reunited with the black and white photo album for the first time in over six decades.

The pair, who live in Newcastle-under-Lyme, got married in Hall Green, Birmingham, on June 8, 1952.

Father-of-two,
grandfather-of-four and great-grandfather-of-two Patrick met his wife 
Rose at the age of 17 and they have been together ever since.

He worked as a bakery manager before moving onto being a general manager of Mr Kipling’s cakes in Stoke-on-Trent in the 1960s.

He added: 'It was great to see the pictures again of everyone, old relatives, it brought a tear to my eye.

'It was great to see my wife looking so lovely on her big day and I am so glad we have managed to get it back.

'The family can’t believe it, they’re
amazed and excited, they haven’t seen this sort of thing before so it 
is brilliant it has come back into our lives.'

Housewife Rose said: 'I am very very happy, it is nice to see all the old memories.

Looking back: The couple are pictured on their wedding day with relatives

Celebration: This image shows many other friends and family members who attended the wedding

'The pictures are clear and it is only the cover that is slightly tattered.

'How we managed to lose it is a mystery, I really don’t know how it ended up in that skip.

'We
just couldn’t believe it when we got it back, we haven’t been back to 
Birmingham since the 70s, I just have no idea how it got there.

'We are full of nostalgia.'

Emotional: Mr Roach said it was great to see the wedding pictures, which brought a tear to his eye. This shows the cover of the album

Confirmation: This shows the page in the album confirming the couple's wedding details
