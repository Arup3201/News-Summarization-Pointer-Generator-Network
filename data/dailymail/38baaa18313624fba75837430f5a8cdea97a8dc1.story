A person who witnessed Georgina Bartter's collapse at a dance festival was disgusted that at least five bystanders were videoing the 19-year-old as paramedics tried to save her life.

Georgina Bartter, 19, was at Harbourlife festival at Mrs Macquarie's Chair near the Sydney Botanical Gardens on Saturday when she lost consciousness on the dancefloor.

She died on Saturday night at St Vincent's Hospital, Darlinghurst from multiple organ failure. Friends told police that she took just one and a half pills, believed to be MDMA.

The teenager was the oldest of three children and believed to be studying accounting. She finished Year 12 in 2013 at Wenona, a private girls' high school in North Sydney.

A witness has told Daily Mail Australia of his distress when he realised strangers were filming Ms Bartter after she collapsed on the dance floor.

Georgina Bartter, 19, died of a suspected drug overdose at Harbourlife festival in Sydney on Saturday

'I was five metres away from her when she collapsed. She was in the middle of the crowd and people had their phones up, pointed at her while medics worked on her,' he said.

'It was just sick. I saw about five guys filming. You can tell the difference between somebody texting and somebody videoing.'

The witness says Ms Bartter was on the ground and unresponsive while at least five men nearby filmed her.

'One of my friends grabbed the phone out of someone's hands and yelled, "what are you doing?"'

'You wouldn't think people can be so low.' 

Ms Bartter's close friends have detailed the distressing events that lead to her suspected overdose.

A close friend, who spent most of the day before and during the festival with the 19-year-old, told Daily Mail Australia that he first noticed something was wrong when she started shivering uncontrollably at around 4pm.

'She seemed fine for a while and then she started shivering as if she was getting cold', the friend revealed.

'She started going downhill from there.'   

Friends said the teenager had taken one and a half pills before she collapsed

Despite friends giving her water and trying to warm her up, Ms Bartter continued to deteriorate.

'I was with her for a while, just me and her, and I was there trying to give her a hug and keep her warm', the friend said.

As she got worse another friend and his girlfriend were caring for the teenager from Longueville in Sydney's lower north shore before she started convulsing around 4.40pm.

The same pair then travelled in an ambulance to hospital with Ms Bartter, where she died later that night. 

'It's been pretty tough for all of us,' the friend said, describing Ms Bartter as a 'bubbly' and 'friendly' girl.

Another man was introduced to Ms Bartter at around 4pm by a mutual friend, and said the 19-year-old was shaking very badly.

'I shook her hand ... Her hand was shaking really really bad, but she was smiling, she said "Hi I'm Georgina",' he told Daily Mail Australia.

He said although she seemed unwell he noticed no signs that she was about to collapse.

'If I had of looked at her and she'd been uneasy on her feet or looked like she was swaying we would have helped her ... If we had seen any sign that she was about to collapse we would have done something.'

'It's an absolute tragedy', he added.

On Monday, a service was held in the 19-year-old's memory at Wenona, the high school Ms Bartter attended until her graduation in 2013.

It's understood Georgina Bartter's younger sister currently attends the private girl's school.

'We have had a beautiful service for Georgina today with our Senior College students, and our younger girls have met with staff and counsellors,' said Dr Briony Scott, the school's principal.

'As parents and teachers, we will continue to walk alongside our young people, focusing onhope, and helping them come to terms with this loss.'

Dr Scott says the school community is 'terribly sad' by the death of 'this gorgeous, funny, bright young woman'

'She will be remembered for her scholarship and for her active and friendly approach to life. She had an infectious sense of humour and we will miss her enormously.'

'I thank our community for their kind words and offers of help, which we have passed on to the Bartter family.'

'Our hearts and our prayers go out to them at this time.'

The head of St Vincent's Hospital's Emergency department, Dr Gordion Fulde told Triple M that everything was done to save the economics student, who was in a critical condition when she arrived at the hospital. 

'Ultimate tragedy, a teenage girl dies,' said Dr Fulde.

'As she was critical, within minutes, the intensive care consultant and team were mobilised and rushed down.'

'It was quickly evident the only chance of survival was to put her on a heart lung machine. This equipment mechanically gives her blood flow and oxygen,' said Dr Fulde.

Operating equipment was moved down to the emergency ward as Ms Bartter's condiiton was quickly deteriorating.

'The cardiothoracic surgeon and operation theatre staff and the hi-tech machine were brought.'

'Despite care only available in a few hospitals worldwide a lovely girl died.' 

Witnesses recall seeing the young woman collapse, dropping to the ground in the middle of the dancefloor where she shook uncontrollably

Dr Fulde says the team at St Vincent's Hospital remain devastated after witnessing the family's intense grief. 

'The grief and devastation of the family, of the mother was indescribable.'

The family of the teenager released a statement on Sunday remembering her as a 'beautiful young woman'. 

The statement also remembered her as 'vibrant' and said the teenager's behaviour was out of character, Nine News reported.

'She was a beautiful and vibrant young woman, who was much loved and will be sadly missed, the statement read.

'She had allergies, and it was extremely out of character.' 

The family reportedly said, 'Georgina was allergic to drugs and never would have knowingly taken them', according to Channel Seven. 

An autopsy will be carried out to determine what was in the pill that contributed to her death.

Officers were alerted to the unconscious 19-year-old woman as they carried out a drug operation at the event.

Witnesses recall seeing Ms Bartter 'collapse' in the middle of the dance floor and begin frothing at the mouth.

'She was dancing next to us when she collapsed on the dance floor. I thought she was pretty hammered but then she just dropped to the floor,' one witness told Daily Mail Australia.

'It was shocking, you just don’t know what to do. We were all waving our arms around for a paramedic.'

Friends described Ms Bartter, seen here with her father, as a 'bubbly' and 'friendly' young girl

The three witnesses were distressed to learn that the young woman had died, but say that night they knew something was drastically wrong. 

'Medics were trying to resuscitate her and she was frothing at the mouth,' the witnesses, who wished not to be named, explained.

'When she got carried out she wasn't well. Her eyes were in the back of her head and her friends were freaking out.'

Two of the witnesses explain that it was 'wild' and claim they saw four people taken to hospital due to what they assume were drug-related incidents. 

'She was the worst but we saw three other people taken out by ambulances.'

'I actually wondered this morning if anyone had died cos I saw that many people overdose and in a bit of a state. It was that wild.' 

NSW Ambulance service confirm that four people were treated from Mrs Macquarie's Chair.

Two people were taken to hospital by ambulance, including Ms Bartter. The second case was an alleged assault.

Two suspected drug-related cases were treated at the scene.

Another witness recalls seeing the girl become ‘drowsy’ and ‘shaking’ before she collapsed.

‘Not long after she collapsed the medics were with her. She was shaking non-stop for a bit while on the ground. Very sad sight. Condolences to her family.’ 

Officers, meanwhile, arrested 78 people at the event for drug offences.

Inspector Stewart Leggat of City Central Local Area Command asked for anyone with knowledge about synthetic substance sellers to come forward.

'The information you provide could save someone's life.'

Insp Leggat warned about the dangers of taking illegal drugs, emphasising there was no quality control in their production.

'Quite simply, you don't know what you are getting - seeking a synthetic high, could result in a serious injury or death,' he said.

'If you know of a business or person who may be involved in the sale of illegal synthetic substances, please contact Crime Stoppers immediately. We don't need to know who you are, all we need is the information you have. 

Witnesses said they saw at least four people taken to hospital one the same day, from suspected drug-related incidents

'The information you provide could save someone's life.'

The organisers of Harbourlife, Fuzzy Events, have extended their sincere condolences to the young woman's loved ones and assure the public patron safety is a priority.

'Right now our thoughts are with her family – we can hardly imagine the pain and heartbreak they must be feeling, and they have our deepest sympathy,' the statement read.

'Harbourlife has been held annually since 2003. It has a fully equipped first aid tent with an emergency doctor, 2 paramedics, 3 first responder medics, 2 supervisors and a communications officer.' 

The 19-year-old was treated by paramedics at the scene and transported to St Vincents hospital, Darlinghurst where she died
