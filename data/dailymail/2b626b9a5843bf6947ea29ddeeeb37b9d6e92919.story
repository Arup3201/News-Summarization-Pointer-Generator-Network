Kidnapped: Ali Zeidan is pictured after being captured by a militia group in Tripoli today

Libyan prime minister Ali Zeidan today said that he is 'fine' after being freed by militants who kidnapped him from a hotel in Tripoli and demanded that he resign.

The kidnapping was carried out by a militia this morning in revenge for the government's role in the capture of a top Al Qaeda suspect by U.S. troops.

But Mr Zeidan was released six hours after he and two of his guards were snatched from the Corinthia Hotel, where he lives, and returned to government headquarters.

After regaining his freedom, the prime minister told his cabinet: 'We hope this matter will be treated with wisdom and rationality, far from tension,' he said. 'There are many things that need dealing with.'

He later appealed for calm in a television broadcast, saying: 'I hope this problem will be resolved with reason and wisdom' and without any 'escalation'.

Britain's Foreign Secretary William Hague expressed relief at the news, tweeting: 'I welcome release of Libyan PM. We will work with Libyan gov on ensuring the transition remains on track and insecurity is addressed.'

A spokesman for the Operations Room of Libya's Revolutionaries, a group of former rebels, claimed responsibility for Mr Zeidan's adbuction and blamed the U.S. operation which captured suspected terrorist Abu Anas al-Liby.

'His arrest comes after... John Kerry said the Libyan government was aware of the operation,' the spokesman said.

As many as 150 gunmen were seen driving up to the hotel in pick-up trucks, with some laying siege to the building and others going to Mr Zeidan's suite on the 21st floor.

The prime minister did not resist when he was led away around 5.15am, according to witnesses, who reported that no shots had been fired.

Corinthia's security manager said 
that the gunmen had brandished an arrest warrant for Mr Zeidan from the 
public prosecutor, although the official's office said that no such 
document had been issued.

The two guards who were kidnapped with the prime minister were beaten by their captors, but later released.

A government official said the prime 
minister was being held at the Interior Ministry's anti-crime department,
and was 'in good health and being treated well'.

Mr Zeidan's release came after members of a rival militia stormed the building where he was being held and opened fire on his captors.

The two sides exchanged gunshots, but the prime minister was not hurt before being freed, according to a leader of the militia which kidnapped him.

Global leaders were quick to speak 
out against Mr Zeidan's kidnap - Mr Hague said: 'I condemn the abduction of Libya's Prime Minister and call 
for his immediate release.

'Our
ambassador is in touch with other members of the interim government. It
is vital that the process of political transition in Libya is 
maintained.

'The government and people of Libya have our full support at this concerning time.'

Ali Zeidan, 62, was one of the most prominent Libyan dissidents during the rule of Colonel Muammar Gaddafi.

He started his career as a diplomat under the Gaddafi regime, serving in India during the 1970s, but in 1980 he defected and fled to Switzerland.

Along with former ambassador Mohammed Magariaf, Mr Zeidan helped lead the National Front for the Salvation of Libya for 30 years.

When the uprising against Gaddafi's rule began in 2011, he took a leading role in the National Transitional Council, the umbrella group for exiled dissidents.

Mr Zeidan was the council's envoy to European governments, and is believed to have been crucial in the effort to persuade French president Nicolas Sarkozy to support air strikes against Gaddafi's forces.

Following the fall of Gaddafi in October 2011, he was elected as an opposition congressman, and last year became prime minister with the support of groups opposed to the Muslim Brotherhood.

Mr Zeidan is considered relatively liberal, although he has previously pledged that Libya should be 'a state based on Islam'.

Two
years after a revolution toppled dictator Muammar Gaddafi, Libya's central 
government has been struggling to contain rival tribal militias and 
Islamist militants who control parts of the country.

On Tuesday, Mr Zeidan called for the West to help stop militancy in his country.Â 

The Operations Room of Libya's Revolutionaries was one of many armed groups involved in the toppling of Colonel Gaddafi in 2011.

The militia has since been hired by the Interior Ministry to provide security in Tripoli.

Mr Zeidan's spokesman initially denied that he had been kidnapped and dismissed the news as 'rumours'.

But he later confirmed the news and claimed that he was coerced by the kidnappers into denying the reports.

A
statement on the Libyan Government's website read: 'The head of the 
transitional government, Ali Zeidan, was taken to an unknown destination
for unknown reasons by a group.'

Al-Arbiya
television has shown what it claims are stills of Mr Zeidan, a former 
human rights lawyer, frowning with a group of men in civilian clothes 
around him.

The Corinthia Hotel where Mr Zeidan was taken is home to a number of diplomats and government officials, and is usually considered to be one of the safest locations in Tripoli.

Following the 
abduction, the Libyan cabinet met for an emergency session chaired by 
the deputy prime minister, Abdel-Salam al-Qadi.

Islamist militant groups were angered last weekend when al-Liby was snatched off the street by U.S Navy Seals in Tripoli.

He was seized in an early morning raid on Saturday over the bombing of U.S embassies in Tanzania and Kenya in 1998.

Extremists took to Facebook to urge 
fellow Libyans to target ships and planes as well as taking U.S. 
citizens hostage in order to exchange them for imprisoned jihadists.

Several groups accused the Libyan Government of colluding with the U.S over the arrest, but officials denied any prior knowledge of the operation.

Mr Zeidan's kidnap comes just hours after he met with members of al-Liby's family on Wednesday.

According to reports, dozens of unarmed Libyan soldiers occupied Mr Zeidan's office on Monday demanding unpaid wages.

Mr Zeidan was appointed Prime Minister by the General National Congress in Libya in October last year and took office the following month.

He had previously served as a human rights lawyer in Geneva.

Mr Zeidan started his career as a Libyan diplomat in India. But he was exiled from the country for three decades after defecting and forming the National Front for the Salvation of Libya in 1980.

During the overthrow of Colonel Muammar Gaddafi in 2011 he served as the European envoy for Libya's National Transitional Council, and is said to have been instrumental in persuading France's then-president Nicolas Sarkozy to back anti-Gaddafi rebels.

U.S. State Department spokeswoman Jen Psaki, travelling with Secretary of State John Kerry in Brunei, said: 'We are looking into these reports and we are in close touch with senior U.S. and Libyan officials on the ground.'
