Battered by 25ft waves, a terrified British couple and their pet Jack Russell clung for hours to a life raft after their yacht sank.

Leonard and Lisa Rorke are lucky to be alive after finding themselves stranded in the open ocean during a storm, 900 miles off Bermuda.

They were eventually rescued after a passing tanker answered their distress call.

‘We really did not think we were going to live,’ said Mr Rorke, 55.

‘It is nothing short of a miracle that we are still here and have survived. We were clinging on for life when we were found.’

The
 Rorkes, crew member Henri Worthalter, 29, and their terrier Dexter were
 forced to abandon their 49ft yacht Blue Pearl on Thursday night after 
she began to sink following two days of severe storms in the Atlantic.

U.S. coast guards rescued Leonard Rorke, 55, Lisa Rorke, 50, from Peterborough along with their Jack Russell Terrier, Dexter

The group, who had planned to take three weeks to sail across the ocean from the Caribbean, leapt into an inflatable life raft.

‘We had to jump and hold on for dear life,’ said Mr Rorke. ‘We left with  nothing, but we are just grateful to  be alive.’

The
 couple, from Oundle in Northamptonshire, were able to activate an 
electronic radio beacon in the life raft that allowed the US coastguard 
to direct ships towards them.

A British-registered tanker called the Tilda Kosan was among three vessels that answered the distress call.

The 351ft ship, which was on its way to Mexico with a cargo of gas, was 36 miles from the Rorkes when it began the search.

Despite
 the atrocious conditions and pitch darkness, the captain managed to 
locate the life raft. Due to its size, the tanker had to make three 
passes before it could manoeuvre alongside.

Mr Rorke, a computer technician, said  the rescue was the finest piece of seamanship he had ever seen.

‘I
 cannot find words to adequately describe how skilful the captain was in
 getting alongside us,’ he said. ‘We were being tossed around in the 
life raft and literally clinging on for our lives.’

The
 group were hoisted aboard the tanker in the early hours of Friday. It 
is due to drop  them off in Bermuda today before continuing on its 
journey.

The rescue effort 
began after  Mr Rorke and his 50-year-old wife sent out a mayday signal 
when they realised they were sinking after the bulkhead broke up and the
 yacht began taking  in water.

Three sailors including a British couple and their dog had to be rescued in the Atlantic Ocean 900 miles northeast of Bermuda

The
 US coastguard was notified by the International Rescue Centre after a 
message came in saying that people were in a life raft and needed help.

Mr
 Rorke praised the speed with which the coastguard reacted, saying that 
the radio beacon on the raft lasts only for about 48 hours.

Search
 and rescue controller James Hines of the 5th District Command Centre in
 Portsmouth, Virginia, said: ‘The presence and proper activation of the 
emergency position indicating radio beacon was instrumental in saving 
the crew members.’ 

Neighbours
 of the Rorkes, who have two daughters, said the couple had discussed 
the dangers of bad weather before they left their £300,000 detached home
 to start the trip.

Richard
 Morley, 63, who lives on their street, said: ‘We talked about how the 
middle of the ocean was probably the best place to be if there was a 
hurricane or anything.

‘We were just saying how you would rather be there than in the harbour with boats and everything flying everywhere.

‘I am glad they are OK – they are a nice couple.’
