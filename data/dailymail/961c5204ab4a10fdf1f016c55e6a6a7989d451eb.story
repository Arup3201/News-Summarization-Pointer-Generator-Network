Oklahoma man Desmond Campbell was identified last week by police as wanted in at least seven assaults cases.

Authorities linked him to 10 counts of sexual assault - including rape in the first degree and rape by instrumentation - as well as seven counts of burglary and six counts of robbery.

A possible assault against an eight woman was pending, with all occurring between June 5 and June 29 in Tulsa.

After naming the 30-year-old at a press conference last week, police said their suspect was actually in a critical condition at Saint Francis Hospital, according to 2NEWS.

Karma?: Desmond Campbell, 30, was wanted over seven assaults on women in Tulsa, Oklahoma, when he crashed his car and died

The 30-year-old was wanted a total of 23 charges, including 10 sexual assault complaints, seven burglaries and six robberies

According to KJRH, Desmond Campbell, 30, was in critical condition and unresponsive following a car crash June 29

Campbell’s car hit a light pole on I-44 about 10 minutes after the most recent assault was reported on June 29, just minutes after the most recent alleged assault.

There were no other vehicles involved.

Campbell later died in hospital.

Following the crash, police used DNA to connect Campbell to the crimes he was wanted over, according to the Oklahoma State Bureau of Investigations.

Search warrants also show police found some of the victims’ belongings in the wreck of Campbell's car.

A source told 2NEWS Campbell was pronounced dead at 11.23am.

Will autopsy is expected to completed on his body on Wednesday.

However toxicology results may not be available for another six to nine weeks.

At a press conference Tuesday afternoon, Tulsa County District Attorney said they were processing Campbell's charges when they learned of his death.

None of the crimes will be processed now that Campbell is deceased.

'The death of Mr. Campbell isn't going to provide any justice for these victims in a criminal court of law,' assistant DA Steve Kunzweiler said.

'However the justice he will face will come from a higher authority.'
