Close to the edge of a jetty with his arms spread wide, Dylan Alkins braces himself as a wave crashes in.

To the 14-year-old posing for this picture three weeks ago, it might have seemed like a game – but it was one that would soon claim his life.

Friends watched in horror on Sunday as he was overcome by a 20ft wave that dragged him into the freezing water at West Beach in Newhaven, East Sussex.

Waves: Friends posted a photo of the 14-year-old playing weeks ago, one-and-half miles down the coast from the spot where he was swept away

Rescue crews battled treacherous 
conditions to try to save him, but the effort was called off when hopes 
of finding him alive faded in the evening.

Dylan was the first victim of
the storm that caused devastation across the country.

Tragedy: Emergency services called off the search for Dylan Alkins after he was dragged into the water

Friends
of the keen footballer, who had turned 14 this month, paid tribute to 
him yesterday, but his family were said to be too distraught to speak.

Rhys
Davey, 14, was with Dylan and friends Zach Bennett and Paige Skinner 
when he disappeared. ‘A massive wave came and washed him out in front of
my eyes,’ Rhys said. ‘There was nothing we could do.’

Paige, 14, said: ‘We were all down by the beach – we had gone to watch the waves. It is something we do quite regularly.

‘Dylan was standing about 15 metres away from the sea. He wasn’t swimming like everyone said – he isn’t stupid.

‘We
turned to look towards Peacehaven at the waves and when I turned around
there was a massive wave. It must have been 20ft and it came over the 
top of him and pulled him into the sea. I was in shock.’

Another
friend, Aaron Windsor, 12, said: ‘Dylan came down at about 4pm. He was 
hyped up wanting to go in the waves. He was a risk taker – he liked 
messing around.’

Emergency services: The operation has become one of search and recovery, according to the Maritime Coastguard Agency. The rescue was called off on Sunday night

Car park: Sussex Police, who were still at the scene yesterday, confirmed Dylan had been swept away by 'strong currents' and said the incident was distressing

Dylan’s 
family, who are originally from Liverpool, moved to Newhaven last month.
Since then, he had taken to standing by the sea when conditions were 
rough.

Zach Bennett posted 
the picture of his friend standing close to the waves in nearby 
Peacehaven three weeks ago. He said it was his ‘last good memory of 
Dylan’.

Zach wrote on 
Facebook: ‘He was the greatest friend anyone could have . . . Now you’re
gone I don’t know what to do. Miss you always.’

Witnesses
said they had seen the group of youngsters playing by the edge of the 
water but did not want to tell them off for fear of causing a 
confrontation.

Called off: A helicopter circles over the water as emergency services spent six hours searching for the schoolboy in brutal conditions

On the seafront: Dylan Alkins, 14, of Newhaven, East Sussex, was swept out to sea on Sunday as the St Jude storm gathered momentum

‘I thought 
about warning them to stay away as it is dangerous, but thought they 
would tell me to go away as they were young lads,’ one said.

‘The conditions were atrocious. I wish I had gone over to warn them now.’

Lifeboats, a police helicopter and officers on the shoreline continued to search for Dylan’s body yesterday.

Chief
Inspector Katy Woolford of Sussex Police said: ‘All agencies are 
continuing to do everything possible to find the boy and our thoughts 
are with the family.’
