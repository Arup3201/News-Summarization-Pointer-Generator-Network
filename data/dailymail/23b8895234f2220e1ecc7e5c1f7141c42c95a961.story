First we had breast milk ice cream. Then there was breast milk jewellery. And now pairs of tiny baby booties made from donated breast milk have been created by British designers.

Simple kitchen equipment was used by Nick Gant and Tanya Dean, both lecturers at the University of Brighton in East Sussex, to transform proteins in the milk into a hard plastic-type material which was then moulded into the booties.

They cannot be worn, but they have been created using milk donated by a mother to promote World Breast Milk Donation Day this Sunday.

The tiny, one-inch booties were created using donated breast milk, from which proteins were extracted and then used to create a hard plastic-type material

The inch-long booties are not the first type of sustainable footwear to have been created by the innovative designers. The pair have made other sorts of shoe from
unusual waste materials.

They
have created children's slippers from dog hair, flip flops from beach 
waste collected by volunteers, recycled wine corks into men's brogues , Cinderella glass slippers
and they have 3D-printed a shoe from recycled office paper.

Designer Tanya Dean shows the one-inch-long baby booties she has co-created with Nick Gant, using donated breast milk at the University of Brighton in East Sussex, to promote World Breast Milk Donation Day

The pair - described as 'masters of material manipulation' - have worked with brands including Absolut Vodka and Vivienne Westwood, and are currently working on producing a trainer using chip fat.

Of their breast milk project, Mr Gant said: 'The aim is to highlight the importance of breast milk donation, and more broadly to challenge people's perceptions about so-called waste products.

'We want to show that they can be used to raise awareness and communicate issues about material culture, ethics and sustainability.

'Turning waste material like breast milk which couldn't otherwise be used, but which is embedded with meaning and personal history, into something new, gives the products created greater meaning and value.'

Tanya Dean and Nick Gant have created other upcycled footwear, including children's slippers made from dog hair and flip flops made from plastic found on the beach

The process to create the booties was relatively simple. It involved gently heating some breast milk, then adding some vinegar to help form a congealed curd cluster, similar to mozzarella.

It was then pressed into silicon moulds and dried over the course of four days.

Also in their repertoire are men's brogues made from cork

There are plans for five more pairs of booties to be made. The first pair will be presented to a donor to mark World Breast Milk Donation Day.

Mr Gant and Ms Dean worked with Gillian Weaver, manager of the milk bank at Queen Charlotte's and Chelsea Hospital in London, and chairwoman of the UK Association for Milk Banking's national forum.

The milk bank, run by Imperial College Healthcare NHS Trust, provides specially heat-treated breast milk collected from volunteer donor mothers for use in feeding sick and premature babies.

Ms Weaver said: 'Seeing these tiny booties made from breast milk is a unique reminder of the valuable role that breast milk plays in helping premature babies to survive and grow.'

The pair have also created sustainable flip flops from plastic found on the beach and in the ocean which they turned into thread

Jewellery made from breast milk proved an unlikely hit among new mothers in April.

Mommy Milk Creations is just one of several stores on craft site Etsy.com to plasticize breast milk samples so that it can be transformed into wearable keepsakes such as pendants and bracelets.

Allicia
Mogavero from Southern Rhode Island in America, who runs the online store, 
instructs buyers to send two tablespoons of their milk in a zip-lock 
bag, so that she can preserve it in resin.

The mother-of-three told MailOnline that she can 'barely keep up' with orders and the response has been 'overwhelming'.

Customers tell her that the
jewelry 'is a gorgeous reminder of such a special time' and a great way
of commemorating 'the bonding experience you had with your child.'

On receiving a breast milk sample, Ms Mogavero 'plasticizes' it, then molds it into miniature shapes such as hearts, moons, stars or tiny feet and hands.

The 'milk bead' is then set in 
clear resin and silver hooks and chains are added. The child's name
or a special message can also be included.

Personalization: Mothers can choose to have their child's name added alongside the 'bead' of breast milk

Ms Mogavero warns that the color of the 
finished piece will vary depending on the sample of milk and no two 
pieces are ever the same.

'Some milk is more yellow than others,
other milk is very thin and will create a less bright bead, if you 
will,' she writes on her website.

'There may be some areas in your breast milk bead that appear 
slightly darker or whiter than the rest of the bead. This is because milk has fatty and non-fatty parts.

'For the most part your bead will look
like a uniform color but under very close inspection you may see the 
slight color variations or speckles.'

A restaurant in London sold breast milk ice cream to customers in a cocktail glass in 2011.

Icecreamists, based in Covent Garden, named the £14 dish Baby Gaga... until Lady Gaga launched a lawsuit against them.

Victoria Hiley, 35, from Leeds provided the first 30 fluid ounces of milk which was enough to make the first 50 servings.

The recipe blended breast milk with Madagascan vanilla pods and lemon zest.

A costumed Baby Gaga waitress 
served the ice cream in a martini glass filled 
with the breast milk ice cream mix. Liquid nitrogen was then poured into 
the glass through a syringe and it is served with a rusk.

Ms
Hiley added: 'It wasn't intrusive at all to donate - just a simple 
blood test. What could be more natural than fresh, free-range mothers 
milk in an ice cream?'

Victoria works with women who have problems breast feeding their babies. She
said she believes that if adults realise how tasty breast milk actually
is, new mothers will be more willing to breast feed their own newborns.

'You can kid yourself that its a healthy ice cream!' said Victoria.

Donor: Victoria Hiley, 25, provided 30 fluid ounces - enough to make the first 50 servings

'But it is very nice it really 
melts in the mouth. I teach women how to get started on breast feeding 
their babies. There's very little support for women and every little 
helps.

'I'm passionate about the good that breast feeding does for babies.'
