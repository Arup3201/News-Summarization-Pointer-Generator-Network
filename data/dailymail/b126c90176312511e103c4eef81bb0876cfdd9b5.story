The daughter-in-law of Nike's co-founder has been arrested for allegedly sexually abusing a 17-year-old member of the track team she coaches.

Melissa Bowerman, 43, was arrested at her home in Fossil, Oregon on Monday after police received a tip earlier this month that she'd been involved with an inappropriate relationship with a student.

Bowerman's husband, 76-year-old Jon Bowerman, the son of late Nike co-founder Bill Bowerman, told The Oregonian he is shocked by her arrest but that she has his support.

'She's still my wife, I still love her and still will no matter how this thing turns out,' he said.

The arrest comes two years after she 
was dismissed as a volunteer track coach at another school in Oregon for
 taking a 17-year-old student to the prom.

She had insisted
 there had been no inappropriate relations in that case and that they simply 
danced to a few slow songs but mostly played ping pong and foosball.

At
 the time, she said she went to the prom with the teenager because he 
felt bad that he had no date and had been struggling in English class.

Gilliam
 County Sheriff Gary Bettencourt, who had received a complaint from a 
chaperone, said he found no evidence that Melissa Bowerman broke the 
law in the 2012 incident.

Still, she was dismissed and moved to coach at Madras High School. After staff kept a close eye on her, she was promoted to head coach, the Oregonian reported.

But after receiving a tip earlier 
this summer that she might have had a relationship with one of the 
runners, police launched an investigation and identified the boy.

Married woman: Bowerman has been married to the Nike founder's son, Jon, for six years. They were previously forced to leave a coaching position after she went to prom with a student

Her
 husband of six years said police served a search warrant at their home 
in Fossil on Monday and searched his wife's computers, cameras and other
 
belongings. He was not home at the time.

He said he has not been able to speak with 
his wife since she was arrested. While he said that everyone should have
 learned from her previous dismissal, he added that she still has his support.

Melissa
 Bowerman faces charges of second-degree sexual abuse, luring a minor, 
online sexual corruption of a child in the second degree and 
contributing to the sexual delinquency of a minor.

She is being held in the Jefferson County Jail in Madras and will be arraigned on Tuesday.

Police have said they are concerned there may be other victims in the current investigation.

Nike co-founder Bill Bowerman coached track at the University of Oregon from 1949 to 1972, winning four national titles. His relationship with track great Steve Prefontaine has been featured in two films.
