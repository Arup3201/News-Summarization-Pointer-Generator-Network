Andy Carroll is keeping in shape in case he gets the call to go to Brazil for the World Cup with England.

The West Ham striker jetted off on holiday to Dubai with girlfriend and former The Only Way Is Essex beauty Billi Mucklow.

And Carroll landed to be greeted by the news he was one of seven players on standby for a place in Roy Hodgson’s England squad.

The former Newcastle man took to the beach to practice yoga to keep himself in shape just in case he gets the call to go to the tournament in South America.

He could have been getting some yoga tips from the former TOWIE star who is a yoga instructor back home in Essex.

On Monday Carroll made it clear he was hoping to be on the plane to Brazil.
