Usually soldiers on parade are expected to wait for the command to present arms before displaying their weapons.

But one female solider in Bicester, Oxfordshire, caused a stir after she was spotted flashing a tattoo of an antique six-shooter pistol on her leg.

The body art was photographed during a disbandment parade for 23 Pioneer Regiment after it was broken up as part of MoD plans to cut 20,000 Army jobs.

Prince Richard, Duke of Gloucester, inspected the troops as they formed up in Bicester, Oxfordshire, today - though apparently didn't notice the unorthodox body-art

The ceremony, which took place this afternoon, was attended by Prince Richard, the Duke of Gloucester.

Lynn Pratt, mayor of Bicester, said: 'It is extremely sad to lose such a vital part of our community. 

The first record of pioneers goes back to 1346, when soldiers bearing the name were recorded on the rolls at Calais.

It took until 1854 for the first unit to be formed, called the Army Works Corps, during the Crimean War.

This was changed to the Labour Corps during World War One, and then again to the Auxiliary Military Pioneer Corps, which was shortened to the Pioneer Corps, during World War Two.

During that conflict soldiers from the pioneer regiments took part in the D-Day landings, with 23 Pioneer Regiment digging fuel supply lines along the English Channel.

King George VI added the distinguished 'Royal' moniker to the Corps' title in 1946, before they became the Royal Logistic Corps in 1993.

'The Regiment has had such a positive impact on the town for many years and the families we have made friends with will be sorely missed.

'We do hope that those who do decide to stay continue to feel an important part of our community. 

'23 Pioneer will forever remain in our hearts and the dedication of Pioneer Square in our town centre will ensure they remain an important part of the history of Bicester.'

The regiment, which is charged with logistical tasks such as digging trenches and repairing defences, has been based at the site since 1941.

Troops from 23 Pioneer helped to support soldiers taking part in the D-Day landings during the Second World was, and were also involved in recent conflicts including the Falklands and Bosnia. 

The Regiment also did tours of the Middle East, including Iraq and Afghanistan, where three soldiers were killed.

Its teams helped to search for improvised explosive devices such as roadside bombs, protected convoys, and contributed to construction projects.

Lieutenant Colonel David Coulston, the commanding officer, said: 'Bicester has become home to many of my soldiers over the decades and furthermore for some it is the only home they have ever really known. You only have to talk to members of my regiment to realise how true it actually is.'

'We will disband formally in September this year, however we should see the arrival of a new regiment by late 2015. 

'I am confident they will receive the same extremely warm welcome that the Pioneers have had over the years. We have been honoured to be associated with Bicester, on behalf of all those I represent, our sincere thank you to you all.'

According to the Army's website, small tattoos are allowed as long as they are not offensive, obscene or racist.

Small tattoos that aren't offensive in any way are not normally a problem, depending where they are on a soldier's body and how visible they are.

The MoD recommends people considering joining the Army who have tattoos should visit their nearest Army careers centre and ask them to check whether it will be OK.

The Navy and RAF have a tougher stance on tattoos, requiring them all to be covered up while wearing uniform. If the tattoo is not covered by the clothing then they should be 'concealed cosmetically or by adhesive paper'.

Tattoos should be discouraged, RAF guidance says, and those that are 'obscene or offensive', as well markings which are excessive in size or number, are banned.

The Navy also ask new recruits to sign a piece of paper which details all tattoos they may have. They must then be revealed during a medical examination.
