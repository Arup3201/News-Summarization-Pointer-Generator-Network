A four-year-old has been left with a hole in his nose from a leaking battery which was stuck for a month after medics allegedly mistook it for a Rice Krispie.

Arif Miah from Bedford eventually had the battery removed after four and a half weeks when a black liquid started oozing from his nose and ears.

His parents fear he could have breathing problems for the rest of his life because of the hole in his septum – the division between the two nostrils.

They are considering legal action against Bedford Hospital after medics refused requests for an X-ray and were adamant that the blockage was caused by a Rice Krispie.

Parents Arju and Shipa Miah, both 26, first took Arif to the hospital in November after their other son Akram, two, said he had put a battery up his older brother's nose.

Doctors helped the couple give Arif a 'mother's kiss' where she put her mouth over his, closed his unblocked nostril and gently blew to dislodge the item, but he was not given an X-ray.

'If they had taken us seriously in the first place, none of this would have happened. I asked them for an X-ray but they said no.

'They said it was a Rice Krispie because when they looked in his nose they saw a scab that was the colour of a Rice Krispie. I think it was the acid from the battery scabbing up. 

'A simple X-ray would have shown the battery and they would have removed it immediately.

'I'm really angry with the hospital, I feel that they just didn't listen to me and now my son could be facing problems for the rest of his life.'

The four-year-old eventually had the battery removed after four and a half weeks when a black liquid started oozing from his nose and ears

Several days after the hospital visit a black liquid started oozing from his ears and nose and his parents took him to their GP.

They diagnosed 'an infection' and sent them back to their home with antibiotics.

But last week Arif began having trouble breathing and his worried father took him back to A&E at Bedford Hospital where he was seen by four doctors.

They told them to come back the following day to get the battery removed because there were no doctors available in the Ear, Nose and Throat department.

It was eventually removed on December 12 when Arif was given a general anaesthetic.

'He's such a beautiful little boy and now he could potentially have long-term health problems,' said Mr Miah.

Bedford Hospital said there  was no record of the battery being mentioned when Arif was first taken to A&E

'I dread to think what might have happened if it had been left any longer.'

But the hospital claims staff were never told the youngster had a battery in his nose.

A hospital spokesman said there was no record of the battery being mentioned when Arif was first taken to A&E on November 11.

But Mr Miah insists he told medics that he thought his son had put a battery up his nose on the first visit.

A hospital spokesman said: 'Arif first attended A&E with his parents on November 11 with a suspected foreign body up one of his nostrils.

'Staff were able to remove an object, which turned out to be a Rice Krispie, and checked that the nasal airways were clear.

'The parents were advised to see their GP if they had any further concerns.

'We were not made aware by his parents on this occasion that they suspected Arif had placed a watch battery up his nose; had this been mentioned he would have been referred to an Ear, Nose and Throat specialist immediately for further investigation.

'Arif's parents have not approached us regarding the care he received, so we would welcome them to contact us so that we can look into this matter further.

'In the meantime Arif will continue to receive follow-up care with our specialists to monitor his recovery.

'He added: 'It is important to point out the dangers of children and small batteries.

'As in the case of young Arif, they can cause permanent damage in a relatively small period of time.

'If a parent suspects their child has placed a battery up their nose they should seek medical advice straight away.

'The battery would be removed urgently, as was done in the case of Arif once we were made aware.'
