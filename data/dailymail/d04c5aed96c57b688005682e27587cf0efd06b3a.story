When Txiki Begiristain made his way out of the draw hall in Nyon, Manchester City’s director of football wondered out loud why he bothered to make the short hop to Switzerland.

For Manuel Pellegrini’s team to go deep into the Champions League, City must overcome one of the most feared forward lines in the history of the game. Again.

They were beaten, well beaten as it happens, over two legs by the brilliance of Lionel Messi and his Barcelona team at this stage of the competition last season.

‘It’s unbelievable,’ admitted Begiristain, who left his position as director of football at the Nou Camp to join City in 2012.

‘We don’t need to come to the draw because it’s the same every time. We faced Bayern Munich and CSKA Moscow in the group phase and now we have to deal with Barcelona again, like last season.’

This time there is an added twist, the first time English football has seen Luis Suarez since the forward quit Liverpool in the summer for £75million. It is dreamy stuff and the presence of Suarez, who scored 31 times for Liverpool in their battle with City for last season’s Barclays Premier League, guarantees an edge to the two fixtures.

Suarez has got off to a slow start at the Nou Camp following his ban for sinking his teeth into Giorgio Chiellini at the World Cup, but had great success in England and he will be a real danger.

The draw has thrown up some intriguing clashes and Arsenal will fancy their chances of progressing to the next phase after successfully avoiding one of the giants of European football. Monaco is where Arsene Wenger really got going as a coach, winning the French league in 1988 and he will return to the Stade Louis II to face his former club.

City are certainly going about it the hard way in Europe after Sergio Aguero’s remarkable hat-trick against Bayern Munich and their dramatic win in Rome.

They will play at the Etihad first and then travel to the Nou Camp to face Luis Enrique’s side. That tie is three weeks later as the last-16 draw is so strung out.

The draw has not been kind to City, but the bigwigs expected as much after finishing runners-up to Pep Guardiola’s Bayern Munich.

Still, they are facing a side which has been beaten twice in La Liga this season and are trailing Real Madrid in the table by four points. Despite the brilliance of Messi and the improving Neymar, they do not have the allure of the 2006, 2009 or 2011 European Cup-winning teams. On a good day, City can beat them.

Finishing second in the group makes it a tougher tournament to win, but both of Jose Mourinho’s successes in the Champions League came when he finished as a runner-up.

His Chelsea team coasted through their group this season and the reward is another clash with Paris Saint-Germain.

It means a return to Stamford Bridge for David Luiz, the man once described by England coach Gary Neville as a ‘PlayStation footballer’. Luiz, a member of Chelsea’s Champions League-winning team under Roberto di Matteo in 2012, was sold by Mourinho in May for a staggering £50m.

Although his relationship with Mourinho deteriorated in his final months at Stamford Bridge, the Brazil defender is guaranteed a warm reception when he returns to London.

This is the draw Mourinho claimed he wanted when his team finished top of Group G with a comfortable 3-1 victory over Sporting Lisbon last week.

PSG were beaten 3-1 in their final group game when the holy trinity — Messi, Neymar and Suarez — scored for Barcelona in the Nou Camp last week. Laurent Blanc’s French champions are struggling to find their rhythm and were beaten 1-0 by lowly Guingamp at the weekend. He will do well to still be in a job when they face Chelsea.

Last season Chelsea were well-beaten in Paris, prompting Mourinho to shake hands with the entire PSG bench after Javier Pastore’s injury time goal made it 3-1.

 

13/5 Bayern Munich

11/4 Real Madrid

6/1 Barcelona

7/1 Chelsea

14/1 Man City

18/1 Atletico Madrid

22/1 Arsenal 

25/1 PSG

28/1 Borussia Dortmund, Juventus

50/1 Porto

100/1 Bayer Leverkusen

125/1 Monaco, Basle

200/1 Shakhtar Donetsk

250/1 Schalke

Six days later, when Chelsea got them back to the Bridge, Mourinho took off on a memorable touchline dash after substitute Demba Ba put them through on away goals with an 87th-minute strike.

They were beaten in the semi-final by Atletico Madrid, but the latter stages of this tournament are the target for all three English teams.

Arsenal, who finished second in their group behind Borussia Dortmund, have a decent chance of making progress. Monaco rely on the creaking bones of former Chelsea defender Ricardo Carvalho and then there is the enigma that is the former Manchester United forward Dimitar Berbatov up front.

There was a touch of romance and more than a hint of pragmatism when Wenger asked for the Champions League gods to pit his recovering Arsenal side against his former club.

He got his wish, but now they have to find a way through.
