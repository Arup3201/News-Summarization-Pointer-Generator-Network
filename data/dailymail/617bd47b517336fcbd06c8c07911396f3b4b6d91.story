Retired managing director: John Knott, 71, was found dead at his home on Monday

A retired managing director who feared
 his home would be surrounded by travellers’ camps is thought to have 
shot dead his seriously ill wife before turning the gun on himself.

John
 Knott, 71, and his wife Elizabeth were found dead at their  
300-year-old country house following a battle to stop a new site being 
built on their doorstep.

He 
is said to have feared being hemmed in if council planners approved the 
camp in a field next to their £500,000 property – which already had 
travellers living nearby.

Mr
 Knott also faced the strain of caring for his 70-year-old wife, whose 
health was believed to be fading as she battled Alzheimer’s Disease.

Neighbours
 said yesterday that these problems may have tipped him over the edge, 
causing him to shoot his wife of 37 years and then himself.

Police
 confirmed a shotgun registered to him was recovered from the house at 
Pow Green, a hamlet outside Ledbury in Herefordshire. Officers are 
investigating whether the deaths were the result of a murder-suicide or a
 suicide pact, but said nobody else was involved.

The
 couple were described as pillars of the community, who moved to the 
area from Worcestershire following Mr Knott’s retirement in 2006.

Mr
 Knott, a former church warden,  was said to be under ‘a lot of stress’ 
while fighting a planning application for the travellers’ camp in a 
field next  to their house. 

Six
 weeks ago, he wrote a letter,  published on Herefordshire County 
Council’s website, objecting to plans to convert the field into a 
one-family  site featuring a toilet block and  septic tank.

Police were called to the home, pictured, of John and Elizabeth Knott near Bosbury after worried relatives could not get in contact with the couple

Mr Knott, feared that his property, pictured, would be impacted by any adjacent development after a family sought to change a field to the right of the property from agricultural to traveller accomodation

Mr Knott, whose house, marked 1 bounded the site, marked 2, objected to the planned traveller's site marked 3

In
 it, he said: ‘There are at least eight settled (traveller) families 
within a one-mile radius of the proposed site. The area cannot sustain 
any more.’

He also 
expressed concerns that his home and neighbouring properties could be 
flooded by sewage from the septic tank if the plans for the camp were 
approved.

The proposed site would have been the second set up near the Knotts’ house in two years.

In 2012, the council approved plans for a traveller camp on the other side of their property, separated from them by woodland.

Two caravans and a day room were installed on the Oakfield Nash End Lane site.

Last
 night, a former colleague of Mr Knott’s at Birmingham-based Ashford 
Construction said: ‘They faced being virtually surrounded by traveller 
sites. It drove him  to despair.’

Lyn
 Hodgkiss, who runs a  butcher’s shop in a nearby village where Mr Knott
 was a regular customer, said: ‘His wife had Alzheimer’s. He was 
fighting the travellers near his house and it must have got too much for
 him.

Mr Knott had written to Herefordshire Council to express his concern about this planned change of useage from Agriculture to a one-family traveller site

‘He always used to 
come in and give us a nice order and he used to come in all happy and 
ask how our son is. I could only say good things about him.’

A neighbour added that the couple were ‘very chatty and friendly’ when they moved to the area.

He added: ‘Mr Knott had worked in the building trade but his wife was pretty poorly.

‘Apparently she was fading. He was very concerned about having a camp next door at the same time as caring for his wife.

'The
 last time I saw him, he said he was under a lot of stress. He said he 
was worried about the possible impact the traveller camp would have on 
them because they have to drive past their house to get there.’

Mr Knott, whose property is circled, claimed the planned development, outlined in red, also presented a danger to traffic in the area due to the narrow road

Mr Knott said in his planning objection that he feared that developing a site so close to his home could put his 300-year-old cottage at risk of flooding

Mr Knott, feared the site to the south, marked in red would lead to flooding of his home, circled centre. He told planners that there was already traveller accommodation in the area, circled top centre

The couple’s local vicar, the Reverend Nicky Seabright, said yesterday: ‘The community are deeply shocked.

‘We do know that Mrs Knott was suffering from a progressive illness which must have been challenging for them both.’

Mrs Knott, who was known by her middle name Anne, had a 48-year-old daughter called Jane from a previous marriage.

There was no answer at her home in Worcester yesterday. Other relatives declined to comment.

Mr Knott, who was a former managing director of a construction firm, also expressed concern about the hand-drawn map attached to the planning application

Mr Knott's cottage is located on the northern boundary of the area marked in blue on this document

A
 West Mercia Police spokesman said that officers were called to the 
house at around 10.30am on Monday after family members were unable to 
contact the couple.

He added: ‘We would like to speak to anyone who saw Anne and John Knott prior to Monday August 11.

‘At
 present, the last confirmed sighting was around midday on Saturday 
August 9 and if anybody has had contact with them in recent days, we 
urge them to come forward.’ Post-mortem examinations found they each 
died of a single shotgun wound.
