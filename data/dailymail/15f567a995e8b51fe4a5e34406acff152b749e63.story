Ryanair is set to offer a new in-flight entertainment programme for passengers and contrary the airline's previous business model, it will be available free of charge.

The trial is expected to start imminently on flights out of Dublin, with passengers able to log-in to the system on their tablets and smartphones.

A number of pre-recorded films and TV shows will be available for viewing through the plane's internal WiFi, although full internet usage will not be permitted.

Users will stream the programmes of their choice.

A Ryanair spokesman has said that the service will be free and will be paid for by advertising.

John Hurley, chief technology officer at the low-cost airline, told the Telegraph: 'It's aimed at passengers on flights of more than two or three hours. 

'They'll watch a couple of adverts and will then have access to a selection of pre-recorded TV shows and films which will be streamed through internal Wi-Fi.'

Ryanair is still in negotiations as to the scope of viewing that will be offered, but should the tests prove to be popular, it is expected to be rolled out to the entire fleet of 300 aircraft in 2016.

Back in 2009 the Irish airline trialled the use of WIFI on board its flights for calls and texts, and floated the idea again in 2013 and last year.

However, so far the company have been unable to justify this technology when matched to their low-cost flights, saying that an increase in fuel spending will be the result. 

Ryanair is normally associated with charging passengers for any extras it makes available

The move appears to go against the airline's previous business model of charging passengers for every extra offered.

Controversial CEO Michael O'Leary was once famed for stating: 'Anyone who thinks Ryanair flights are some sort of bastion of sanctity where you can contemplate your navel is wrong. 

'We already bombard you with as many in-flight announcements and trolleys as we can. Anyone who looks like sleeping, we wake them up to sell them things.'
