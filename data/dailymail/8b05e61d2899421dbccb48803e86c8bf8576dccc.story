It's normally only women  who are trained in the art of turning curtains into costumes and become a dab hand at changing nappies at a world-famous nanny college.

But now one male teenager is set to be the first-ever man to pass through the education degree course that turns out the modern Mary Poppins.

Now Michael Kenny is hoping to become practically perfect in every way while he attends Norland College, in Bath.

Practically perfect in every way: Michael Kenny, joins his fellow students on his first day at Norland College

Student Michael Kenny, 18, is the only male in a classroom full of 48 women studying at the college - but it takes more than a spoonful of sugar to pass the demanding course.

Michael, who has had to endure lots of
jokes from his friends, admitted he initially wasn’t even sure if the 
college in Bath, Somerset, took on male students.

He had to ring the college to check - because he had only ever seen female students around the city.

Now while his female counterparts wear
the classic cream dress and brown hat, he will don a tweed jacket, 
cream shirt, matching tie and beige trousers for his studies.

Warm welcome: Fellow students Louise Flatley, Alice Jefferies, Annalise Hobbs, Flo Richardson and Lucy Sheridan make Michael feel at home

Spot the odd one out: Michael will be put through his paces alongside his female peers on the course

But he says instead of feeling out of the loop he has been warmly welcomed by all of the female students.

Michael said: 'Funnily enough they have just been caring more about how I have been feeling, making sure I am OK.'

Michael says he was drawn to the job because he has spent time teaching English and maths to severely disabled children in an Ugandan orphanage.

Spick and span: Michael is neatly turned out for his first day of college, which boasts that every single graduate leaves there with a job

Students base themselves on the perfect nanny, Mary Poppins

He said: 'I wanted to work with children
because I can understand young people a lot better - I find them a lot 
easier to get on with.

'I think I would like to be a nanny for a few years, because it is the whole reason you go through the training.

'But then after that I would like to do a PGCE and become a nursery teacher or work in a prep school.'

Michael, whose parents Simon and Mary, sister Alice, 17, and brother John, 12, live in Uganda, will be only the second male in the college’s 120-year history to graduate with the Norland Diploma.

Norland College principal Liz Hunt welcomed Michael to the fold and said her supercallifragilisticexpialidocious students were more in demand than ever before.

She claimed every graduate will have a job offer sourced by the college’s in-house nanny agency so they are ready to start straight after finishing their studies.

Mrs Hunt said: 'We always have more job opportunities than we have students, the demand certainly outstrips supply.

'The modern-day Norland graduate also goes on to work in a wide range of careers such as management of nurseries or primary school teaching.'

Peter Cummins was the first 'manny' to study at the world-famous Norland College for nannies.He was the only male among his class of 21 girls to take the three year Diploma course and passed 'with merit'.

Peter, 22, from Dyfed, Wales, said at the time: 'I don't see any problem. My careers adviser hinted that it was very female-dominated, but I took no notice.

Working away: The Norland College has a world famous reputation for top class training going back over 100 years

Norland founder Emily Ward

'Being male has never been an issue with either of the parents that I've been with.'

BA Honours degree course students pay £13,710-a-year for the first 24 months followed by two years at £4,120-a-year which includes probationary working 'on the job' with a family.

But a fully qualified Norland Nanny will earn at least £26,800-a-year living in - while a live out nanny would expect a salary of around £34,500 per annum.

Norland College, in Bath, Somerset - motto 'Love Never Faileth' - has trained more than 7,000 nannies since it was founded in 1892 by Emily Ward.

It was originally named the Training School for Ladies as Children's Nurses, but it quickly became known as Norland Institute because of its location on Norland Place in London, before relocating to Bath in 2003.

Emily Ward introduced a uniform so Norland graduates needed to be recognised as professionals and not mistaken for housemaids and it is still a strong part of the college's tradition.

Nannies-to-be: The women were given their special uniforms, that are still worn today, so they would be taken as professionals

What a natty nurse! Norland student Jessy Burton and two of her charges in the mid 1890s. The women were schooled in domestic science and children's education so they would become first class nannies

History: These Norland Nurses in 1952 joined a rich tradition of graduates who are sought after for their skills

Norland College, founded in 1892 by Emily Ward, is a leading provider of childcare training.

The
founder focused her training on the principles of Friedrich Froebel, 
the German educationalist who developed the 'kindergarten system'.

It's Early 
Childhood Studies course concentrates on numerous aspects of childhood.

Students study elements of social science, psychology, child 
health, history, literature and education.

It also trains its students - known 
as 'Norlanders' when they graduate - how to work with families, develop a
child's math skills and become a whizz in the kitchen and teach a child
not only how to cook, but how to cook healthy meals.
