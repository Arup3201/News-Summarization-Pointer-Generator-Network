Hekla volcano, one of Iceland's most active volcanoes, is on the verge of  a major eruption that could impact air travel, experts have warned.

A University of Iceland geoscientist believes a 'bulge' on the northern sign of the volcano is caused by huge deposits of magma rising.

In 2010 the eruption of Iceland's Eyjafjallajökull volcano hampered air travel due to the ash and gas it has spewed into the atmosphere, and there are fears another eruption could cause the same issues.

The Hekla volcano, which experts warn is on the verge of erupting for the first time since 2000.

Researchers say there is now more magma than in 2000, the last time the Hekla volcano erupted.

University of Iceland geophysicist Pll Einarsson said in a report published in the Icelandic newspaper Morgunblai on Monday that according to GPS monitoring of the expanding surface, there is now more magma underneath Hekla than before the volcano's last eruption in 2000, .

Hekla volcano 'could erupt soon,' Einarsson said.

The last eruption at Hekla started on Feb. 26, 2000, and lasted for nearly two weeks.

Then, it took just 79 minutes from the first warning earthquake until the volcano exploded, Einarsson said.

Hekla volcano has blasted more than 20 times in the last 1,200 years, blanketing southern Iceland with thick layers of ash and lava.

Some of the eruptions are short and small, while others continue for months, pumping enough ash into the atmosphere to chill temporarily the northern latitudes.

Lava explodes from the Hekla volcano in an unpopulated area about 150 kilometers (93 miles) southeast of Iceland's capital Reykjavik on Sunday Feb. 27, 2000.

Volcano watchers have anticipated a new eruption at Hekla since 2006, when tiny earthquakes and surface swelling first hinted that new magma had appeared. Media reports warned of similar surface swelling at Hekla in 2011 and 2013, without a subsequent eruption.

Hekla, in the background, was believed to be the gateway to purgatory.

The most prominent sign of an impending eruption is bulging ground on the northern side of the volcano. This surface swelling indicates magma (molten rock) is rising under the volcano, pushing up the ground as it fills fractures and pipes beneath Hekla.
