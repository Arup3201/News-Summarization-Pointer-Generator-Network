It may have traditionalists spluttering into their drams.

But a German supermarket chain is offering Scots cut-price kilts and a set of bagpipes for less than £33.

The poly viscose kilt retails at a penny under £20, while the bagpipes are only £12.99. Those who want to add a polyester ghillie shirt can do so for £12.99 – along with a no-frills leather sporran and chain at £9.99 and socks for £3.99.

Canny Scot: German supermarket chain Lidl is offering Scots cut-price kilts and a set of bagpipes for less than £33 in the run up to the Glasgow 2014 Commonwealth Games

The £46.96 Highland Dress outfit will go on sale in all Lidl stores in Scotland in the run-up to the start of the Glasgow 2014 Commonwealth Games on July 23.

Three tartans are on offer – Black Watch, Royal Stewart and Granite Grey – and they are the cheapest kilts ever to go on sale.

The kilt has a 24in drop and, unravelled, measures five yards – three yards short of traditional specifications.

Music to your ears? Traditional bagpipes start at £1,200, whereas this Lidl version of the instrument is on sale for just £12.99

SLANJ Kilts uses only traditional handwoven material – and owner Brian Halley is in no doubt he would lose customers quickly if he introduced poly viscose versions manufactured in the Far East.

Yesterday, we took the Lidl kilt to Mr Halley’s shop in Glasgow city centre for his expert verdict. He said: ‘You get what you pay for. This is a £20 kilt and it is worth that. It is not a bad kilt.

'I’m not going to criticise shops that would sell them as they bring in a lot of money for the country from tourists, but our shop would lose customers.

‘They are very popular with stag weekenders who buy them for trips abroad. They can also be put in the washing machine, which is not a bad thing after a stag weekend.

‘But we wouldn’t be able to even buy the material for £20. You can see the difference immediately when you see a poly viscose kilt beside a traditional one.

‘They look and feel completely different and most Scots would rather have a traditional one, despite our standard Black Watch kilt starting off at £350.

‘You get what you pay for – and the vast majority of Scots would rather pay the extra knowing they will have a kilt for life.’

But Scottish kiltmakers are not 
impressed, claiming cheap and cheerful kilts produced overseas from 
man-made fibres are affecting their trade.

Ken MacDonald, a governor of the Scottish
 Tartans Authority and owner of Houston Kiltmakers in Paisley, 
Renfrewshire, said: ‘A lot of imported stuff is from places such as 
India and China.

‘However, the majority of folk want to buy something that is high quality and will last a lifetime.

The problem is that when someone goes online and sees a kilt for sale at £20 and then a real one at £300, they just assume a kilt is a kilt and go for the cheaper one.

‘Kilts are symbolic of Scotland, but tourists are probably unaware they are buying a garment made in the Far East which is not Scottish.’

Lidl spokesman Alasdair Fowle was unable to confirm in which country its kilts were manufactured, but said the supplier was a Scottish firm.

He added: ‘This fantastic range at unbelievably low prices will allow the people of Scotland to not only showcase Scotland’s proud heritage and traditions, but will give everyone the chance to really get behind Team Scotland.

‘Traditionally, Highland wear can be quite expensive, which prevents a lot of people from purchasing it, so it’s great to be able to offer everyone in Scotland the chance to buy a kilt for under £20.’

Standard traditional kilts retail for around £350 and are made from wool.

A Jacobite shirt is about £65, a sporran can cost £300 and a top-of-the-range dress kilt can be as much as £700.

Traditional bagpipes start at £1,200.

Also for sale as part of the Scotland at Lidl range are junior ‘playable’ bagpipes in Black Watch, Royal Stewart or Mackenzie tartan for £12.99, along with a tartan hip flask at £6.99.

Ladies can buy Royal Stewart mini-kilts for only £16.99.
