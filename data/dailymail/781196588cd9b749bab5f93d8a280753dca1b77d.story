Detectives hunting the boyfriend of a 23-year-old Russian woman found dead in her flat have arrested him on suspicion of murder, Scotland Yard said.

Felipe Lopes, 27, was arrested on the street in the Farnborough area of Bromley this morning and is now in custody at a south London police station.

Officers issued a photo of Felipe Lopes, 27, after his girlfriend Anastasia Voykina, 23, was found dead at their flat in Streatham, south London, at 2am on Monday morning.

Mr Lopes, who is Portuguese, was last seen on Saturday at 8pm in the Piccadilly area of central London.

Police discovered the body of Anastasia Voykina in a house in Streatham at around 2am on Monday after a missing persons report was filed on Sunday afternoon.

A post-mortem examination gave her cause of death as multiple fractures to the face, head and neck.

Her next of kin have been informed and a post-mortem is due to take place today at 4pm at Greenwich Mortuary.

Police believe the couple first met in London while Miss Voykina was on holiday in the summer. She is believed to have returned to Russia but travelled back to London in recent weeks in an effort to continue their relationship.

Police said she made a phone call to her family on December 30, which was the last known contact with her.

But her family grew alarmed after not
being able to contact Miss Voykina, and her brother Sergei left a 
desperate message online pleading for information about his sister's 
whereabouts on Sunday.

In
the message he said: 'I'm writing here cause the situation can't wait. 
Because it seems like she is lost. Her last contact with us, I mean with
family, was exactly a week ago.

'It is a long time for is to start 
worry, cause usually we chat together day by day or so. This is not a 
joke. We are really worried about her. An I'm asking you, everybody who 
knows her, who know where she could be at the moment or any information 
about her, please send a message.'

Just weeks before her death, Miss Voykina posted messages on Facebook saying how happy she was and how she looked forward to celebrating Christmas with her boyfriend.

In a message posted on December 17 she wrote: 'We've got a Christmas tree!! Yay!! I'm, sooo happy! Thank u soooo much my Santa!'
