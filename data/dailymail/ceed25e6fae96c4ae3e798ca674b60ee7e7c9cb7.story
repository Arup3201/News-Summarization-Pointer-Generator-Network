Darren Bent has joined promotion-chasing Derby County until the end of the season on loan, signalling the end of his time at Aston Villa.

The 30-year-old will officially join the Rams when they transfer window opens on Saturday.

Bent will not be able to feature in Derby’s FA Cup match against Southport as players must be registered with the FA by midday on Friday – but will be available for the key game against Ipswich at Portman Road on January 10.

FIFA rules bar players from representing more than two clubs in a season – but that has been sidestepped because Bent’s move to Brighton was on an emergency loan, and as such is not counted.

The FA, Premier League and Football League all sanction these kind of transfers, even if FIFA have expressed frustration in similar circumstances in the past.

The world governing body voiced their disapproval when Nicky Shorey played for three clubs in 2010.

Bent will play for Derby having appeared for his parent club Aston Villa too.

Bent tweeted on Friday: 'Excited to join @dcfcofficial & will give everything to help the team for the rest of the season.

'I would also like to thank Brighton who were great to me during my time there.'

 The short-term transfer brings an end Bent’s Aston Villa career, with his £65,000 per week contract expiring in the summer. 

He moved to Villa Park in January 2011 at a cost of £18million and has scored 25 goals in 72 games.

Bent spent last season on loan at Fulham and had a brief spell at Brighton this campaign, scoring twice in five matches.

Brighton paid £18,000 of his wages and Derby are likely to be contributing a similar amount.

Bent is believed to have chosen Derby ahead of other clubs for football reasons.

McClaren will believe he can re-invigorate a striker who could add a timely cutting edge to Derby’s bid for Premier League football. 

McClaren handed Bent two of his 13 England caps during his time as national manager.
