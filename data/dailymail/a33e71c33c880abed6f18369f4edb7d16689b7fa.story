How many times have you watched the weather forecast or consulted a weather app on your smartphone, only to be caught out in a heavy shower when experts claimed it would be sunny?

This miserable scenario could be a thing of the past as a new app claims to give users the most accurate weather forecast yet.

Climendo collates and compares data from the most popular and accurate providers of forecasts to deliver a definitive outlook for the day and week ahead.

The app, which is available on iPhone and Android handsets, collects meteorological predictions from 12 providers in the U.S. and Europe to provide an average forecast.

It also matches predictions with historical data from 10,000 weather stations around the world to add weight to the most trusted providers’ predictions, Engadget reported.

Based on the data, the app generates its own forecast for the coming five days, including predictions for the upcoming weather in six hours chunks.

It also shows a ‘probability rate’ so that when lots of readings from different sources are similar, the chances of a sunny afternoon, for example, is 'certain', while when opinions and readings are mixed, the forecast is 'fairly certain' or 'uncertain,' warning users to prepare for potentially changeable conditions.

The app currently shows the temperature, weather conditions and wind speed for different cities, but its inventors promise that more detailed information is set to come.

Climendo launched in Sweden last year and has now been redesigned for a global audience.

It was invented by two surfers, David and Jacob von Corswant, who wanted to compare weather forecasts easily to find the best overall prediction and ensure a good surfing session.

They said: ‘After 15 years of comparing forecasts manually and measuring the probability of certainty, we decided to find a simpler alternative. It was just too time consuming to go through the overwhelming number of weather apps in our phones.

The app shows a 'probability rate' so that when lots of readings from different sources are similar, the chances of a sunny afternoon, for example, is 'certain', while when opinions and readings are mixed, the forecast is 'fairly certain' or 'uncertain,' warning users to prepare for potentially changeable conditions

'We soon realised that if not all, at least most people, go through a similar procedure of looking at two or more forecasts every day. This is how Climendo was born.’

They claim their app makes planning ahead a little bit easier

‘More useful features will be added - forecasts from your local provider will soon be included - and the number of searchable countries and cities will increase,’ they said.

The updated app is available on Apple’s App Store for 69p/99c for a limited time and a new version is set to arrive for Android users who can purchase it for the same price from Google Play.
