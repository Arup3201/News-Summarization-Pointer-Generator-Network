The Cowardly Lion costume worn by Bert Lahr in The Wizard Of Oz has sold for more than $3 million at an auction in New York City.

New York auction house Bonhams said the big cat outfit worn by Lahr throughout the 1939 classic was fashioned from actual lion hides and its face is a sculpted likeness of the late actor.

Weighing more than four stone in total, it would have been unbearably hot and heavy under the bright studio lights, and featured a hidden front zipper and attached tail.

The unidentified buyer bid $2.6 million plus a premium to the auction house of $477,000, bringing the total to $3,077,000 - three times what the costume was expected to sell for.

A spokesman for costume owner James Comisar says a secondary costume used in the film - thought to be worn by a stuntman on set - was sold in recent years for close to $1 million.

Comisar has a trove of TV memorabilia from shows including "I Love Lucy" and "Lost." He has said he plans to use money from the Cowardly Lion costume sale to exhibit his collection.

In addition to the Cowardly Lion costume, the auction featured Wizard of Oz memorabilia such as an original script, the Witch Remover prop wielded by the Cowardly Lion in pursuit of the Wicked Witch and an assortment of memorable Emerald City costumes. 

As well as the lion costume (right) the sale also included a blue gingham 'test' dress and pinafore (left) worn by Judy Garland as Dorothy during the essential pre-production period

The sale also included a blue gingham 'test' dress and pinafore worn by Judy Garland as Dorothy during the essential pre-production period, when costumes, hairstyles and all artistic aspects of moviemaking are refined prior to filming.

Other items  in the Hollywood auction included costumes from Gone With The Wind, North By Northwest and Rosemary's Baby.

The most iconic piano in Hollywood history – the one played by Sam in the Humphrey Bogart and Ingrid Bergman classic Casablanca – also went under the hammer, fetching $3.4 million

The salmon-coloured instrument, one of two featured in the film, is the one on which the movie’s signature tune, As Time Goes By, is played by Sam (singer Dooley Wilson).

It is one of 30 items from the Second World War drama put up for sale by a private collector.

The doors of Rick's Cafe America, a final draft of the screenplay, signed cast photos, and passports created for the characters in the film all went up for auction.

'Bonham’s is thrilled to represent this remarkable Casablanca collection, certainly one of the most significant film memorabilia collections still in private hands,' said the director of Entertainment Memorabilia at Bonham’s, Catherine Williamson, earlier this year.
