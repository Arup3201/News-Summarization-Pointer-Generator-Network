Two South Carolina sisters have had their illegal in-home day cares shut down within months of each other after a baby died while being cared for by one of them.

Tracey Garrett was busted this week for running an unlicensed day care with 10 children. Sister Pamela Wood’s day care was shut down earlier this year after police responding to the death of a baby found nearly two dozen more children stashed in and around her home.

Cops were shocked to find 14 children hiding in the basement, two more near a loaded gun and a toddler left alone outside, according to reports.

Tragedy: Kelly Rynn Martin died while being cared for by pamela Wood, her death led to a series of shocking discoveries in the woman's home

Garrett’s husband had no clue she was watching the children illegally, and told WYFF his wife had been watching children for years.

It is not clear what charges Garrett may face, but her sister was accused last month of multiple crimes after deputies rushed to her home after she reported an unresponsive baby and made a series of startling discoveries.

Accused: Police say Pamela Wood neglected the children in her care, and had four times the amount her day care permit allowed

Wood, 49, called 911 Feb 21 after one of 23 children she was watching over was found unresponsive in a basinet, police said.

She told police there were only six children in the home – likely because she was only licensed to supervise that many – but 14 were found stashed in the basement with her 16-year-old daughter, sources told Fox Carolina.

An additional two children were discovered alone in a room in reach of a loaded gun, arrest warrants cited by the station said.

A toddler was found alone in the backyard as well, cops said.

Cleaning fluids, alcohol and a working toaster were found on the floor, a counter or in cabinets in reach of even a crawling baby that had no childproof locks, police said.

The woman is also accused by officials of lying about the baby’s death and making other statement s aimed at hindering any investigative efforts made by authorities.

Police said that stuffed animals and blankets found in the bassinet with Kelly Rynn Martin after she died have spurred them to look into whether it was sleeping in unsafe conditions.

They charged her with obstructing justice, violation of day care licensing and unlawful neglect of a child.

House of horrors: Nearly two dozen children were found in dangerous conditions both inside and outside Wood's home, police said

Only five miles away: Sister Tracey Garrett was also running an illegal day care

The incident has sparked a fire in residents concerned about the quality of care their children receive.

‘When Kellie Rynn passed away, we never really knew the difference between a licensed and registered day care, and we want parents to know,’ Kathryn Martin told WYFF. ‘There are too many dangers out there that can happen to any family.’

Another woman who trusted Wood to watch her baby is also angered.

‘We loved them, we considered them our family,’ Katie Gresham added.

‘It makes you feel like a horrible parent when you think you have done everything possible to make sure that your kids are safe, and then to find out everything that you thought they were in is not what it seemed.’
