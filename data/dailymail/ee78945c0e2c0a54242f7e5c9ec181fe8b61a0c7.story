Wrapped up warm, braving freezing temperatures and polar bears, these brave hikers are helpingÂ  open up one of the most remote places on Earth.

Complete with a 18kg backpack mounted telescopic camera, they are pictured mapping the Arctic for Google Street View.

For parts of the rest of the world, Google can send its quirky camera-mounted Street View cars to map large areas.

Adventurous: Google has already taken us inside North Korea and Japan's nuclear ghost towns. But its Street View team has now mapped the inhospitable Arctic

However, in Iqaluit, a town in the 
Canadian territory of Nunavut with a population of just 7,000, they have
had to reply on this hardy group of trekkers.

They have ventured along little-known trails - such as a notorious 15km cul-de-sac known as the Road to Nowhere.

The
Street View team spent four days exploring the wild terrain and 
collecting the images which will open up this vast wilderness to the 
rest of the world.

Speaking to the Guardian, Aaron Brindle,
project leader, said: 'I live in Toronto and I absolutely take for 
granted that everything is where it should be and that this map is kind 
of my world, but for so long that hasn't been the case in the north.'

The town, which is inhabited by just 7,000 people, will be available to see on Street View in July.

However, it is not just the rest of the world which is benefiting from this mapping exercise.

The town is hoping to use the maps to promote the area for people looking to visit or live there. It is also hoped the maps could speed up planning decisions for the town.

Google Street View also gave the world a
rare glimpse into one of Japan's eerie ghost towns which remain 
deserted two years after the country's triple disaster.

Technical: This image shows one of the camera-mounted backpacks

Google Street View this week released new pictures inside the 12-mile exclusion zone around Namie that was devastated in 2011 by the earthquake and tsunami.

The natural disasters sparked the Fukushima nuclear disaster that left the area uninhabitable.

The stark pictures were captured this month after Namie town mayor Tamotsu Baba invited Google into his town.
