A cinemagoer who buys a large popcorn and fizzy drink could consume their entire week's sugar at once

Cinemas have been slammed for selling supersize snacks, amid evidence one box of popcorn can contain up to 35 teaspoons of sugar.

Professor Susan Jebb, the Government’s obesity tsar, yesterday called on the chains to offer clear nutrition information, smaller packs and healthy alternatives.

Last week the World Health Organisation suggested maximum sugar intake should be limited to as few as six teaspoons a day.

This means a cinemagoer who buys a large popcorn and fizzy drink could be consuming their entire week’s sugar allowance in just one sitting.

A 200g box of toffee popcorn at Cineworld comes in at 840 calories and 121g of sugar, equivalent to about 30 teaspoons. Adding a 32oz Coca Cola carries an extra 407 calories and 101.2g of sugar, or 25 teaspoons.

A large bucket of sweet popcorn at Odeon cinemas amounts to 1,005 calories, which is more than half of a woman’s recommended daily intake. And at Vue, a 200g tub of toffee popcorn contains 138.9g of sugar, which is equivalent to about 35 teaspoons.

Professor Jebb, chairman of the Government’s Public Health Responsibility Deal Food Network, said she was concerned about the ‘excessive sizes’ of cinema snacks and drinks, adding: ‘High street food chains, caterers as well as entertainment companies all have a role to play to make it easier for people to make healthy choices.

‘The least they should do is provide clear information on calories.’

Weight Watchers has joined demands for the three biggest chains, Odeon, Cineworld and Vue, to ban supersized portions of sugary drinks and popcorn.

As part of its ‘Slim Our Snacks’ campaign, the diet group has called for customers to be able to weigh pick and mix sweets before purchase to get an idea of the calories and sugar, and said fruit should be offered as a healthy option.

It also urged cinemas to stop advertising supersize portions as ‘better value’ deals.

Weight Watchers spokesman Angharad Massie said: ‘Cinemas are inherently family focused spaces, yet we all recognise them to be one of the worst spaces for promoting portions of high fat, salt and sugar snacks with little or no choice of healthier alternatives.’

Cinemas do display nutrition but Weight Watchers blast them as one of the worst spaces for promoting portions of high fat, salt and sugar snacks with few options for healthy alternatives

The cinemas do display nutrition information on their websites, with Vue also putting calories on menu boards at the tills.

A Cineworld spokesman said it had trialled healthy choices such as fruit and nuts in the past but these had proved unpopular with customers, adding: ‘The cinema experience is seen as a treat by most people.’

Despite this, the chain is testing a smaller 16oz cup for fizzy drinks, which may soon be rolled out across its cinemas.

Both Cineworld and Vue said visitors were welcome to bring their own snacks. No one at Odeon was available for comment.
