The former Marine convicted of sexually abusing his two children will spend the rest of his life behind bars, after receiving two life sentences in Florida court today.

U.S. District Judge Roy B Dalton Jr. called what 26-year-old Jonathan Adleta did to his children 'heinous', saying he is reposible for 'the destruction and scarring of his own children'.

During the trial it was revealed that Adleta started planning to abuse his children before they were born, telling his pregnant girlfriend Sarah Adleta, 29, that he would only marry her if she allowed him to have 'daddy-daughter sex' with their child.

Sick plan: Sarah Adleta, 29, was convicted of sexually abusing her two children with her ex-husband Jonathan Adleta, 26.  During her ex-husband's trial, she revealed that their plan to abuse their children started before the two were born

The abuse started when their daughter was born in March 2009, and the two were married the following year. They went on to have a son together, and the parents sexually abused both children. 

Soon after getting married, the two broke up but the abuse continued over Skype and with visits to Adleta in OKlahoma where he already had a new girlfriend.

Girlfriend Samanatha Bryant, 23, had a daughter and she let Adleta abuse her as well.

Both women testified during Adleta's trial, shedding light on the gruesome abuse.

During that trip to Oklahoma in December 2012, Sarah let her ex-husband abuse her daughter in his bedroom while she watched.

The toddler 'seemed very resistant and 'really upset' the mother testified, leading her ex-husband to suggest she find another man for the child to have sex with so she wouldn't be 'freaking out' in the future.

The Adletas horrifying and despicable sexual abuse of their own children was only uncovered when FBI were tipped off when the mother sent naked pictures of herself and the toddlers to a man in North Carolina.

The mother performed sex acts on her children so the man could watch, according to testimony she gave the court this week.

Sarah Adleta was sentenced to 54 years in prison in October for abusing her children. The Adleta children have since been put up for adoption.

Adleta's girlfriend Bryant faced seperate charges herself, and was found guilty on two counts of lewd molestation. She was sentenced to consecutive 15- and 30-year sentences.

Assistant U.S. Attorney Karen Gable called Adleta's crimes 'despicable and egregious' and said he is a 'grave danger to children'.

Despite that, Adleta's defense said consideration should be taken in for Adleta's military service in Afghanistan.

The judge disagreed, saying what he did brought 'dishonor to the Marine Corps'.

Adleta's former father-in-law Leonard Lippy, asked the judge to 'make sure he never touches another child again'.

Lippy has no contact with his grandchildren who are being put up for adoption.

'He gets time but it didn't rbing my family back,' Lippy told the Orlando Sentinel after the hearing. 'You're going to tell me two life sentences makes this right?'
