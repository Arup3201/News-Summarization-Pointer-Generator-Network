Doctors’ leaders yesterday attacked plans to crack down on ‘health tourism’ by making foreigners pay for NHS care.

Dr Clare Gerada, of the Royal College of GPs, claimed the reforms could result in migrants ‘wandering around’ with infectious diseases.

And the British Medical Association insisted doctors would not be prepared to ‘enforce immigration checks’ and did not have time to be ‘arbiters’ of who should get patient care.

Claims: David Cameron said British families pay £5,000 a year each in taxes to fund the NHS

Their outburst comes after David Cameron said British families pay £5,000 a year each in taxes to fund the NHS, which should not be abused as an ‘international health service’.

Medical leaders have been accused by ministers of scaremongering over the risk to public health – insisting there would be exemptions in cases of infectious disease. Doctors must play their part in ensuring free services are not exploited by those who should pay, say MPs.

Proposals unveiled yesterday by Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt include a new £200 ‘healthcare levy’ for anyone seeking a UK visa for more than six months, a charge to see GPs for stays of less than six months and a new system to track the use of the NHS by migrant workers.

The Government is also considering changing the rules on organ transplants, which could exclude anybody who does not have indefinite leave to remain in the UK.

A consultation document also suggests that the levy would not cover IVF treatment, cosmetic  surgery or treatment for ‘pre-existing’ pregnancies – which would all incur higher charges.

'Stigmatising foreigners': Shadow Health Minister Diane Abbott has condemned the charges

Visitors from the EU would continue 
to access the NHS free, but a new central collection system would 
recover the costs from their home countries.

The proposals will also end free 
access to GPs for short-term visitors. But the proposals have provoked 
anger among healthcare professionals.

Speaking on BBC Radio 4 yesterday,
Dr Gerada said the ‘rushed’ consultation could lead to migrants with 
highly-infectious conditions ‘wandering around for fear of being 
charged’.

‘I don’t think we should be turning the GP surgery into a border agency,’ she added.

Dr
Laurence Buckman, chairman of the BMA’s GP committee, said reforms to 
the system would mean ‘significant planning and resources’.

‘The botched launch of NHS111 
demonstrates what can happen if a  system is rushed through because of 
politically driven deadlines,’ he added. ‘The BMA would strongly oppose 
any system where GPs are required to act as UK Border Force agents and 
enforce immigration checks.

‘Doctors should spend their time 
treating patients and not acting as the arbitrators of whether patients 
are eligible to receive NHS care.’

His
deputy, Dr Richard Vautrey, said: ‘It would clearly be discriminatory 
for a practice just to ask for documentation from patients who happen to
look foreign and talk funny.’

Mr
Cameron told the Commons: ‘This is a national health service not an 
international health service.’ Tory MP Philip Lee, a former GP, told the
House he was once called to Heathrow to see an arrival who claimed she 
had only just realised she was nine months pregnant.

THE boss of a hospital where 400 patients may have died because  of 
poor healthcare has been forced to resign. Christine Green yesterday 
quit her £150,000-a-year post at Tameside Hospital in Greater 
Manchester.

An NHS report 
found that A&E patients were left in corridors for hours. Tariq 
Mahmood, the medical director, has also stood aside.

Shadow health minister Diane Abbott yesterday said charging so-called foreign health tourists for using NHS treatment was ‘xenophobic’.

She said ‘communicable disease was no respecter of immigration paperwork’ and questioned the scale of the problem in a total NHS budget of £109billion.

Writing on Twitter, she asked: ‘What price xenophobia? Stigmatising foreigners accessing NHS creates a public health risk.’Other Labour MPs distanced themselves from her remarks. 

Shadow immigration minister Chris Bryant welcomed  any attempt to tackle ‘abuse of the system’. David Cameron condemned the lack of cross-party support for a ‘sensible change’.

Patients are being given basic first aid and taken to hospital by police, it was revealed yesterday.

Officers are stepping in to help because ambulances take too long to arrive, said Paddy Tipping, the Police and Crime Commissioner for Nottinghamshire.

The former MP said officers were ‘quite anxious’ because they could face an investigation if a patient died in their care.

East Midlands Ambulance Service – which has failed performance targets – said it was simply making sure both services helped  'each other’s needs'.

It comes after NHS chief Sir David Nicholson said on Tuesday that firemen may help in medical emergencies.
