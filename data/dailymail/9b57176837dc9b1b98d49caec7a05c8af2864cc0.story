Jealous rage: Lewis Atwood punched his mother in the faces several times because she didn't have a Christmas ornament with his name on it

A Michigan man punched his mother in the face several times Friday night in a jealous rage surrounding the decoration of their Christmas tree.

Lewis Atwood, 33, viciously attacked Sandra Atwood, 58, because he saw an ornament with his brother’s name but none with his, according to an affidavit.

Pasco Township Police responded to a 011 call from the Atwoods’ home after a 911 call with no one on the line but shouting and a women yelling ‘you are hurting me’ was heard, the affidavit posted to The Smoking Gun said.

Mr Atwood punched his mother in the face ‘four or five times’ while decorating the tree with her, his girlfriend and brother.

He had been drinking to the point of intoxication and became angry when he noticed his brother had a personalized ornament but he didn’t.

He became enraged and pushed his way through the small crowd to his mother, then began pummelling the poor woman.

She suffered a bloody nose, swollen eye and swollen lip, he had minor injuries to his knuckes and hands ‘consistent with this type of assault,’ the report said.

He was booked on a charge of domestic violence and sent to jail.

MailOnline was not able to confirm if he is still in custody.
