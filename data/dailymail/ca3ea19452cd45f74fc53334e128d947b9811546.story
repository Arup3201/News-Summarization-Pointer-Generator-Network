Swarms of vicious Asian hornets are heading across the Channel to Britain, the public has been warned.

The Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs said it feared the species had already, or was about to, spread to Britain during its peak season of September.

Defra said the Asian hornet – Latin name Vespa velutina nigrithorax – was ‘invasive and predatory’ and attacked honey bee colonies.

A statement said: 'It has spread very quickly to many areas
 of France where it is reported to be causing many problems for both 
beekeepers and biodiversity in the country. The hornet can predate on 
bee colonies, causing significant harm.'

Swarm: The Asian hornet, Vespa velutina nigrithorax, could already have crossed the channel to British shores

It is slightly smaller and darker than an ordinary hornet but packs a vicious sting and the department urged beekeepers to report sightings or send suspected samples to the National Bee Unit laboratory.

Asian hornets were first recorded in Lot-et-Garonne, south-west France, in 2005, after arriving in a pottery shipment from China.

They spread across France but until now were blocked from coming to the UK by the English Channel.

Defra is asking British beekeepers to be on the lookout for the Asian hornet, which is smaller than our own native European hornet, Vespa crabro.

Predatory: The Asian hornet is known to attack bee colonies

'To protect bees from invasive threats it is important for all beekeepers in England, Scotland and Wales to sign up to BeeBase,' a statement from Defra said.

It has asked anyone who thinks they have seen an Asian hornet to notify the GB Non Native Species Secratariat alert at the email address alert_nonnative@ceh.ac.uk immediately.

Suspect sample can be sent to the National Bee Unit laboratory for examination if possible.

Defra advises using a suitable sturdy container (cardboard rather than plastic) and providing as much detail as possible about the hornet and where it was found, along with digital photographs to help with identification.

'Monitoring for their arrival in Britain is strongly encouraged throughout the UK, but especially in areas where likelihood of arrival is considered to be highest, the south and south-east of England,' Defra said.

'Beekeepers and other members of the public should consider hanging hornet traps but remember that it is very important that damage to native wasps, hornets and any other insects is kept to an absolute minimum.

'Spring trapping works. Information from beekeepers in France, who are having to control hornet numbers, show that in areas where traps are deployed in springtime, nest numbers are reduced by up to 90 per cent.

'In the event that Asian hornets become established here, springtime trapping will thus be a very useful management tool.'
