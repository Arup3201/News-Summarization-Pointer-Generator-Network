Thousands of people are being warned to stay indoors and prepare to evacuate after an explosion rocked a chemical waste facility near Bremen in northwestern Germany.

More than 14,000 people were urged to close the doors and windows of their homes in Ritterhude, near Bremen, shortly after the explosion, which sent choking clouds of toxic fumes spiralling into the night sky. 

Police told the DPA news agency that one person was severely burned in the blast Tuesday night and that the explosion damaged a nearby residential area.

More than 300 firefighters and 60 police were called to the scene last night.

Marcus Neumann, spokesman for the local Verden-Osterholz police, said authorities believe the injured man is a plant employee whose car was found outside the plant.

Mr Neumann said the employee responded to an alarm on his beeper, and drove from his home to the plant to investigate.

The cause of the blast was not clear, as the site was still too hot and not yet accessible to investigators, Mr Neumann added.

The plant is owned by Organo Fluid, which specialises in recovering valuable solvents from mixtures of solvents.
