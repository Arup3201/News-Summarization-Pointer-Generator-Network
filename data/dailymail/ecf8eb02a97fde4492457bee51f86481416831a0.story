Liverpool's American owners have told Steven Gerrard he is welcome to return to Liverpool at any time, following the announcement of his departure at the end of the season.

Gerrard made his Liverpool debut in 1998, and has made just shy of 700 appearances for the Reds to date. 

Prinicipal owner John W Henry and chairman Tom Werner said in a statement: 'This news stirs many strong emotions for all of us connected with the club.

'There is sadness that such a great player and person is leaving and won't be playing for Liverpool beyond this season.

'But there is also a sense of celebration and gratitude, that we've all been privileged to watch and work with one of the true greats, not just of this club, but the game in general.

'We will all have our own personal memories of breathtaking Steven Gerrard moments; there are far too many to list.'

Of those memories, many will point to the 2005 Champions League final as an overriding high point in Gerrard's career.

Three down to AC Milan at half-time in Istanbul, Liverpool looked to be heading for defeat, before their captain inspired a miraculous second-half comeback to take the game to extra time.

On penalties, Liverpool were victorious and Gerrard lifted the most memorable trophy of his Anfield career.

Henry and Werner's statement continues: 'His contribution to the club is almost beyond measure and it's testimony to his influence, that despite Liverpool having such a long and distinguished list of legendary figures, the name Steven Gerrard will always be at the summit.

'Another emotion that resonates today is respect; a respect not just for his achievements but also the decision he and his family have reached.

'Steven will always have a part to play for this club, as and when the time comes that he wishes to return.

'I hope we all respect that Steven and his family want to pursue something new and different for the final years of his playing career.

'We all wish him well in this endeavour and look forward to welcoming him back to Anfield in the future, when the time is appropriate.'
