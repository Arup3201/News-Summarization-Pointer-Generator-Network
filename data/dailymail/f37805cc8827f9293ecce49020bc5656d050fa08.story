A trainee solicitor was jailed yesterday for locking her dog in the kitchen and starving it to death.

Roxy, a five-year-old Boxer, died in agony after she was trapped without food or water for more than a week.

Her owner, Katy Gammon, 27, who had moved in with her mother at the time, continued going to work while her pet slowly perished.

Jailed: Katy Gammon arrives at Bristol Magistrates Court, where she was jailed for 18 weeks for neglecting her boxer Roxy, who died after 'prolonged and painful' abuse

Horrific: Roxy the five-year-old boxer died a long, painful death after being locked in the kitchen by trainee medical negligence solicitor Katy Gammon, 27. She was only found when a neighbour saw swarms of flies

Roxy’s body lay undiscovered for 
another eight weeks, by which time it was so decomposed an RSPCA 
inspector had to use a snow shovel to pick it up.

Bristol
 Magistrates’ Court had previously heard that Gammon had confined the 
dog by tying a rope to the kitchen door handle and fixing it to a hook 
in the hall.

Roxy had 
frantically clawed at the door, leaving fragments on the floor, as she 
tried to escape before her death, which would have taken around six 
days.

Gammon is thought to have confined Roxy to one room because she was not house trained.

Her body was found after Gammon started staying with her mother nearby.

She
 returned to feed Roxy until she dislocated her knee and was unable to 
get to the house, then falsely claimed her ex-boyfriend was feeding her 
pet.

Gammon told RSPCA 
inspector Miranda Albinson she had left Roxy without food for a week in 
August, and returned to find an awful smell, adding: ‘I assumed she was 
dead. I never went back.’

Asked if she had deliberately locked her in the kitchen and left her to die, Gammon replied: ‘Yes, basically.’

Cute: Five-year-old boxer Roxy because her solicitor owner 'couldn't cope' with the responsibility of looking after her

Break-up: Adam Taylor, ex boyfriend of Katy Gammon also stood outside court and said he was happy she was jailed, but said it should have been for longer

Roxy’s
 body was discovered in November when neighbours called police to 
complain about flies swarming in the kitchen of Gammon’s house in 
Bristol.

Officers were greeted by a strong smell of decomposition and the kitchen still closed with the rope.They called the RSPCA and Roxy’s remains were removed.

A
 vet said the pet would have taken up to six days to die gradually and 
painfully, becoming blind and falling into a coma before passing away.

Gammon,
 who worked for Bristol legal firm Lyons Davidson specialising in 
medical negligence, had previously pleaded guilty to two counts of 
cruelty. Yesterday, she sobbed as she was jailed for 18 weeks and banned
 from owning animals for life.

RSPCA prosecutor Lindi Meyer told the court about the appalling state Roxy was found in.

She
 said: ‘Officers felt physically sick. The conditions Roxy was living in
 were pitiful. In the kitchen she had a small plastic bed with just one 
soiled sheet. She would have died on the cold, hard, wood floor.

Anger: A anti-animal cruelty protester confronted Gammon as she arrived for sentencing today

Outrage: Several more congregated outside the court calling for stiffer sentences for those convicted of cruelty

Message: The owner of this dog took their pet to court to call for stiffer sentences in cases like these

‘A
 number of items had desperately been pulled out of cupboards. We 
believe this was a desperate attempt at searching for food or water.

‘Roxy suffered a slow, painful death which could have been prevented.’

Farah
 Rashid, defending, said Gammon ‘hated herself’ for the suffering she 
had caused, adding: ‘There is no excuse. This conviction has ended the 
career she has been working for for ten years.’

An
 online petition had collected 100,000 signatures for ‘justice for Roxy 
the boxer dog’, and protesters campaigning for tougher sentencing for 
animal cruelty gathered outside the court and chanted.

Sentencing,
 magistrate Rod Mayall said: ‘You have shown limited remorse. You failed
 to behave as any normal person would have. This is the most serious 
case of animal cruelty encountered in these courts.’

Affectionate: Roxy (pictured with Adam Taylor) originally belonged to a friend but developed anxiety problems after being left alone all day

Adorable: Adam Taylor worked evening shifts and Gammon worked in the daytime, so they thought that between them someone would always be around to look after Roxy

Punishment: Gammon, is now in prison after 
admitting two cruelty charges relating to her treatment of Roxy.  She 
has lost her job with leading Bristol law firm Lyons Davidson

Abandoned: Adam Taylor says that within a few months of them splitting up, Gammon contacted him to say she was struggling to cope and was looking for a new home for Roxy. SHe abandoned her instead
