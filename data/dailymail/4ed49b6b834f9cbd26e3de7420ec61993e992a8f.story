Disrespectful thieves have tried to steal some of the Tower of London poppies, the artist who created them revealed yesterday.

Paul Cummins said they had tried to break into vans holding ceramic flowers that have been removed from the display.

The installation, which attracted millions of visitors, contained 888,246 poppies.

Memorial:Disrespectful thieves have tried to steal some of the Tower of London poppies, the artist who created them revealed yesterday

They are being removed at a rate of 75,000 a day to be shipped to buyers who have paid £25 per flower, raising millions for charity.

Mr Cummins said none had been stolen. ‘When they were taken out of the moat, people were breaking into the lorries to try to get them,’ he said. ‘I am not happy.

‘It is disrespectful to the people who bought them and made them and to the people they represent.’

Auction site eBay banned sales of the poppies earlier this month when buyers listed them online – at more than double the £25 price – while they were still on display.

But as the poppies have been removed from the moat and are beginning to be dispatched to their new owners, thieves have targeted the vans where they are being held.

Mr Cummins said yesterday: ‘When they were taken out of the moat, people were breaking into the lorries to try to get them.

‘They have been trying to do this ever since we put them in.

‘So many people want them but we are not making any more, because I thought it would be disrespectful to the people who died.’

Mr Cummins said that ‘hundreds of thousands of people’ still wanted to purchase a poppy.

In remembrance: The artwork, designed by Paul Cummins, was inspired by an unknown soldier from his home town who wrote a poem which begins 'The blood swept lands and seas of red, / Where angels dare to tread'

The stunning scene at the Tower of London has attracted millions of visitors and was extended for a further two weeks after a campaign by the Mail.

A spokesman for Mr Cummins confirmed last night that none of the poppies had been successfully taken.

A Historic Royal Palaces spokeswoman said: ‘All appropriate security measures have been in place throughout the project to ensure the safe delivery of the poppies to their new owners.

‘An attempt was made to break into empty vehicles at a rest stop on their way to London. A number of other vehicles at the rest stop were targeted in the same way.’
