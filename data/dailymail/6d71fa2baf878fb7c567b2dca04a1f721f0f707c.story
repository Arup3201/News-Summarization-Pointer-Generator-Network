West Ham defender James Tomkins has been charged with assaulting a police officer in the early hours of Sunday morning.

Tomkins, 24, was arrested at the Sugar Hut nightclub in Brentwood and was also charged with resisting arrest and being drunk and disorderly after security staff at the Essex nightspot called the police.

He was arrested on the same day that the east London club released their 
Hammers Christmas Advent Calendar on YouTube, in which he features 
alongside team-mate Jack Collison 
promoting sensible drinking over the festive period.

Tomkins has been released on bail to appear at Basildon Magistrates' Court on January 9.

An Essex Police spokesman said: 'Police were called by security 
staff from the Sugar Hut Village shortly before 12.30am on Sunday the 
22nd following reports of a disturbance.

'Officers arrived and arrested James Tomkins before later charging 
him with one count of assaulting a police officer, one count of 
resisting arrest and one count of being drunk and disorderly in a public
place.'

West Ham have refused to comment.

The incident occurred on the same day that Collison encouraged West Ham fans to enjoy alcohol responsibly in the club's official Christmas video.

In the 90 second clip, which includes words from a number of first team players, the midfielder tells viewers: 'Drink responsibly, enjoy your presents and enjoy yourselves. Have a fantastic Christmas.'

Tomkins, who smiles as his team-mate delivers his message, adds: 'Have a good Christmas and a great New Year. Keep well.'

Tomkins, who played for the entirety 
of West Ham's 3-1 defeat by Manchester United at Old Trafford on 
Saturday afternoon, lives in a £400,000 flat in Brentwood, Essex.

The central defender is believed to earn £35,000 a week after coming through the club's famous academy system, going on to make 137 senior appearances since his first team debut in 2008.

The former England Under 21 player, who also represented Great Britain at the 2012 Olympic Games, was spotted by club-goers being arrested.

Not impressed: West Ham boss Sam Allardyce is bound to be upset with Tomkins' behaviour in the wake of defeat by Manchester United at Old Trafford

Harry Hatt took to Twitter to comment: 'Highlight of last night was seeing James Tomkins get arrested, unreal scenes.'

While Lewis Gray tweeted: 'Just watched James Tomkins get arrested, 
Christ Sam Allardyce is gonna have his way with him Monday morning.'

West Ham captain Kevin Nolan cancelled the players' planned festive party jaunt to Dublin earlier this month as the club look to battle their way out of the Barclays Premier League danger zone.

The Hammers are just one place and a single point away from the relegation zone after defeat at Old Trafford, where Carlton Cole's 81st minute goal was the only consolation as the game finished 3-1 to David Moyes' side.

Hayden Foxe

In 2001, the Australian defender was forced to apologise after he urinated against a bar in London nightspot Sugar Reef during the players’ Christmas night out

Neil Ruddock and Trevor Sinclair

The pair were charged by police after a drunken incident on the players’ festive fancy dress do in Romford in 1998. Ruddock was charged with affray while Sinclair was charged with causing criminal damage. Ruddock was subsequently cleared, while Sinclair was fined £250.

Andy Carroll

The striker was accused of gouging a photographer on the player’s Christmas jaunt to Dublin last year - a claim that was vehemently denied by West Ham and no police action was taken.
