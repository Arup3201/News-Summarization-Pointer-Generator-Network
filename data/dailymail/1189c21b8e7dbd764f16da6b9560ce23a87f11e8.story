A 'cold-blooded' killer who murdered her former best friend out of jealousy over a man was today sentenced to 25 years to life in prison.

Giselle Esteban, 28, killed 26-year-old Michelle Le in the garage of Kaiser Permanente Medical Center in Hayward, California, before dumping her body by a canyon 20 miles away.

Esteban showed no emotion throughout her trial at Alameda County Superior Court, with Judge Jon Rolefson saying he had not seen 'any hint of remorse'.

'No remorse': Giselle Esteban, 28, was jailed for first degree murder after killing nursing student Michelle Le

Jealous: Esteban was convinced that the father of her child was infatuated with Miss Le, pictured, and warned her ex-boyfriend that if he did not end all contact with the nursing student, 'punishment would be swift'

The pair had attended the same high 
school in San Diego, before both moved to the San Francisco Bay area.

But Esteban grew to hate Miss Le, prosecutors said, 
after the victim had a brief relationship with Scott Marasigan, her ex-boyfriend and father of their six-year-old daughter.

Even after Miss Le and Mr Marasigan 
broke up, Esteban was convinced he was infatuated with her old friend, 
said Deputy District Attorney Butch Ford.

Mr Marasigan said the mother of his 
child, who was pregnant again, had taken a knife out and threatened to kill herself and their 
unborn child if he didn't leave Miss Le.

He said Esteban became ‘so enraged that she began essentially to hunt down Michelle.’

February 10: 'I hope you find what you are looking for in someone as disgusting as her. I wish I had a kid with a better man.'

February 17: 'Cut her out for our family's sake. It's the only thing that will convince me you are trying to be better. Otherwise be prepared to be held accountable for your bad actions and decisions.'

February 18: 'If you aren't sorry for anything you have done with that wh*** and are not willing to make things right for (our daughter's) sake, then no, I'm not sorry for the consequences your actions have brought on you both. ... You have dug your own graves.'

February 25: 'FYI, you pushed me into insanity with you putting wh**** before your own family. You should have loved (their daughter) and I more, but you loved sex and attention more. Those two are exactly what you are going to get now. You reap what you sow.'

February 26: 'And you can't protect anyone. Your wh*** will get what she deserves, too.'

February 26: 'Get rid of your wh***. Block her out. Otherwise you bring your own hell on you and all you love.'

February 28: 'I was loving and open and took care of you and Michelle, and you two lied to me, not once but three times. It's only fitting you pay for your mistake. So will she.'

March 2: 'And Michelle has dug her own grave by being a homewrecker and a wh***. ... She won't be an issue for much longer.'

March 17: 'FYI, she won't pass her midterms.'

May 29: (two days after Le's disappearance): 'Where's Michelle?'

He testified that he had dated Miss Le several years ago, but that their relationship was never sexual in nature and they were just friends.

However, Esteban claimed Miss Le had spoken with Mr Marisigan about being pregnant and seeking an abortion in 2005.

Her attorney argued that this was clear evidence the pair had slept together, saying, 'What woman tells a man she's not intimate with that she's pregnant and is going to get an abortion?'

Esteban’s text messages – which began February 10, 2011, with the message, ‘I hope you find what you are looking for in someone as disgusting as her’ - grew increasingly antagonistic throughout the months.

She demanded that Mr Marasigan cut Miss Le out of his life completely ‘for our family’s sake' or 'the punishment would be swift'.

She wrote: 'It’s the only thing that will convince me you are trying to be better. Otherwise, be prepared to be held accountable for your bad actions and decisions.'

On March 2, 2011, Esteban texted: ‘Michelle has dug her own grave by being a home wrecker and wh***… She won’t be an issue for much longer.’

'Sociopath' Esteban told her ex-boyfriend that he and Miss Le deserved to die, said prosecutor Mr Ford.

Mr Marasigan, who had custody 
of their daughter, got a restraining order against her just three days before
Miss Le’s disappearance.

Miss Le was reported missing after she 
failed to return from a break during her shift at the Kaiser Permanente 
Medical Centre in Hayward on May 27.

Two days later, Esteban texted her ex: ‘Where’s Michelle?’

Miss Le’s family had offered a $100,000 reward for her return or details on her whereabouts.

Her white Honda SUV was seen driving out of the garage by video surveillance later that evening and was found abandoned a few blocks away.

Police believe she was killed in the hospital’s car park as CCTV showed Esteban at the scene before and after Miss Le’s disappearance.

Miss Le's skeletal remains were found
in Sunol Canyon, near San Francisco, almost four months after she died,
by the mother of a girl who was raped and killed in 2009.

Carrie McGonigle is the mother of Amber Dubois, 14, who was murdered by sex offender John Gardner III in San Diego.

Grief: Miss Le's cousin and brother 
at a news conference in Hayward shortly before her remains were identified

She and her Labrador - also called Amber - found the body after joining the search for Miss Le in Pleasanton.

Searcher Marc Klaas said the find would be 'of great personal satisfaction to Carrie' and that Amber would be looking down on her mother with 'pride' and a 'big smile'.

Detectives said they found traces of Miss Le’s blood inside her SUV and on one of Esteban’s shoes during a search of Esteban’s home.

Esteban was named as a person of interest in June last year, when investigators questioned and searched her Union City apartment.

She told KGO-TV at the time that she hated Miss Le because she was friends with the father of Esteban’s young daughter, but insisted she had nothing to do with the disappearance.

She was arrested on suspicion of her murder after mobile phone signals from Le and the accused were picked up from the same area.

Before the murder, Esteban did a 
computer search for Miss Le's home address, according to SFGate.com.

She
also stole a security badge and class roster from staff at the aspiring
nurse's university, Samuel Merritt, and called employees in attempts to
learn her schedule, added Mr Ford.

Esteban's attorney, Andrea Auer, 
acknowledged that her client killed Miss Le, but she argued it was 
voluntary manslaughter, with Miss Le provoking Esteban, who committed 
the killing 'in the heat of passion.'

Hidden: After an exhaustive, four-month-long search, Le's body was recovered, badly decomposed, in a California canyon

But Mr Ford said that Esteban had planned
Le's death months in advance. He had audio tapes of Esteban 'laughing 
and talking about killing people', her texts to her ex and evidence that she had gone to great lengths to hide the body.

Esteban had driven her corpse to Sunol Canyon in the victim's own car.

The judge said he had never seen a case with more compelling circumstantial evidence pointing straight at the killer.

Miss Auer said her client had told her, 'Let it go, Andrea,' in an apparent acknowledgment of her crime.

Krystine Dinh, a cousin of Miss Le, told the judge that the killer could take 'her legacy, not her light.'

Esteban did not testify during her three-week trial and was convicted in October.
