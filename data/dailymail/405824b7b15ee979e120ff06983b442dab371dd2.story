A bizarre plan to fine people who 'miss the bowl' in public toilets has been met with derision in China.

Officials in the city of Shenzhen are planning to slap anyone guilty of 'uncouth' use of public facilities with a 100 yuan - approximately £10 - penalty from next month.

But sceptical Chinese poured scorn on the scheme - joking that it would create new jobs for civil servants tasked with standing behind 'every urinating person to see whether the pee is straight'.

The draft regulations did not specify what level of spillage would be regarded as a violation of the new rules, according to a report on the South China Morning Post.

'Such uncouth use of a public toilet will be fined 100 yuan [approx £10] by authorities' from September, a city government official in Shenzhen said yesterday.

But critics on Weibo - China's version of Twitter - questioned how the city intends to enforce the new regulations.

'A number of new civil servant positions will be created. There will be a supervisor behind every urinating person to see whether the pee is straight,' one online sceptic wrote.

'Very good measures. I expect they can create 20 jobs on average for every public toilet,' another said.

A more serious observation came from a Weibo user who wrote: 'It's better to have no rule than a rule that cannot be implemented.'

A commentary in the Beijing Times suggested the proper use of public toilet facilities was a matter to be guided by 'social consensus', and not law.
