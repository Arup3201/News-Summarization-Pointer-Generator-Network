'Sex is actually really beautiful,' she said during an interview on The Conversation. 'It’s the only way we create, and it’s the only way the world keeps going.

'So it’s ignorant not to talk to your kids about it or not make it seem as magical or cool as it actually is. Kids have a TV, so they know what sex is. So educate them and let them know… it’s a beautiful thing, and it is magic, and it’s when you connect with somebody.'
