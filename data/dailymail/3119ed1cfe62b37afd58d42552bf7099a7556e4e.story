Mown down: Schoolgirl Hope Fennell, 13

A lorry driver who drove into a young girl as she tried to cross a road on her bike was texting a friend seconds beforehand.

Darren Foster, 38, crushed Hope Fennell, 13, under the wheels of his HGV and then desperately deleted text messages he had sent from his phone in a bid to cover his tracks while the child lay dying.

Yesterday the lorry driver from Derby admitted both dangerous driving and perverting the course of justice in relation to deleting the texts at Birmingham Crown Court.

Hope was declared dead at the scene of the accident, which happened on Kings Heath High Street, Birmingham, at 5pm on November 7, 2011.

She had been trying to cross the road on a pedestrian crossing.

Passers-by desperately tried to save her life as she lay on the ground but their attempts were in vain.

Foster was interviewed by police after the rush-hour accident and was charged with dangerous driving last July.

A spokesman for West Midlands Police said: 'Hope was trying to cross a busy junction on her bike when she was in collision with the lorry at just after 5pm on Monday 7 November.

'Foster was interviewed under caution after the incident and subsequently charged with dangerous driving in July 2012.

'He will be sentenced on 2 April, but in the meantime he has been given an interim disqualification.'

Last summer Hope's mother Nazan, 46, from Kings Heath, Birmingham, launched a campaign to improve safety measures at the spot where her daughter died.

She said: 'I believe I have lost my child because safety was not taken as seriously as it should be.

'I
think that all HGVs should be fitted with sensors to detect pedestrians
in a blind spot, and the council should ban lorries from the High 
Street at peak times.'

Mrs Fennell chained a bike similar to the one Hope, who attended nearby Queensbridge School, was riding to a lamppost nearby and turned it into a shrine which still stands over a year after her death.

Mrs Fennell said the site had become an important place at which Hope's school friends and family could gather to remember her.
