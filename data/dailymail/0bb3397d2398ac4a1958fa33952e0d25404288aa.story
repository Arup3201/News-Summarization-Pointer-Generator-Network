Booked: San Francisco 49ers cornerback Christopher Culliver, who was arrested Friday March 28, 2014 on suspicion of felony hit and run and reckless driving

San Francisco 49ers cornerback Chris Culliver was tossed in jail Friday after hitting a bicyclist with his car, fleeing the scene and threatening witnesses with brass knuckles, police said.

Culliver, 25, was charged with felony hit and run, reckless driving and weapons possession for the Friday morning incident in San Jose.

This is not the first brush with controversy for the maligned defender, he claimed during the build-up to last year’s Super Bowl that gay players were ‘not welcome’ in NFL locker rooms – he later apologized for the remarks.

Culliver was recklessly driving his Ford Mustang through an intersection just after 10.00am when he struck a pedestrian on a bicycle, police sources told SF Gate.

Another motorist drove after the three year veteran and cornered him while waiting for police to arrive, said police.

A police report cited by the site says Culliver then got out of his car to threaten the driver using a pair of brass knuckles.

Police found the brass knuckles while searching Culliver’s car, they also discovered he was driving on a suspended license, according to KPIX.

The bicyclist suffered only minor injuries, according to SF Gate.

Where it happened: The San Jose intersection where police say Culliver slammed into a bicyclist before fleeing the scene

Reckless: Skid marks show where Culliver reportedly hit the bicycle rider, police said the football player was driving recklessly when the incident occured

Culliver missed all of the 2013 season after tearing his ACL during summer training camp, he had been slated to take over as one of two starting cornerbacks upon his return this year.

It is not clear how this incident will affect those plans, but the 49ers released the following statement regarding this morning’s incident.

‘The 49ers organization is aware of the recent matter involving Chris Culliver. We will remain in contact with Chris and the local authorities as we continue to gather the facts regarding this situation.

As this is an ongoing legal matter, we will reserve further comment at this time.’

Tainted moment: Chris Culliver, #29 of the San Francisco 49ers, watches Jacoby Jones of the Baltimore Ravens catch a 56-yard pass before running in for the touchdown during Super Bowl XLVII - the 49ers' appearance in the championship was tainted by Culliver's derogatory remarks towards gays

Culliver first drew national attention after telling comedian Artie Lang that gays were not welcome in NFL locker rooms and that they should ‘come out 10 years later.’

He made the comments only days before the 2013 Super Bowl, which the 49ers lost to the Baltimore Ravens.

He apologized within hours of the remarks.

‘The derogatory comments I made yesterday were a reflection of thoughts in my head, but they are not how I feel,’ he said in a prepared statement published by KPIX.

‘It has taken me seeing them in print to realize that they are hurtful and ugly,’ he continued. ‘Those discriminating feelings are truly not in my heart.

‘I apologize to those who I have hurt and offended.’

Culliver was booked into Santa Clara County Jail, he remains behind bars as of Friday evening.
