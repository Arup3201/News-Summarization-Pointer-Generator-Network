A 24-year-old man was shot dead in New York on Monday evening after a row over a parking space got out of hand.

Darrell Lynch died on his way to hospital after being shot in the leg by a driver who had been trying to park in the same space as him in Jamaica, Queens.

The victim's 55-year-old mother fired back at the gunman as he fled from the residential street, but he managed to get away in his car unscathed.

Deadly row: Darrell Lynch died after being shot in the leg after a fight over a parking spot in this Queens street

After being shot, Mr Lynch, who had a young daughter, tried to drive away in his SUV but he crashed into two parked cars instead.

At least five bullets were fired during the altercation, which happened about ten blocks from where Mr Lynch lived.

His mother, who has not been named, was questioned by police but has not yet been charged for firing back at the attacker.

Her son had been arrested in the past and was not licensed to carry the .45 caliber gun that was with him, the New York Post reported.

The victim's mother told investigators that her son was shot at after having an argument with another driver about the space he had just parked in.

The shooting was caught by a nearby surveillance camera, and five shell casings were found at the scene, DNA Info reported.

The gunman has not yet been caught.
