Luis Suarez found his shooting boots in England and appears to have taken them back to Spain with him scoring in Barcelona’s win over Granada.

The former Liverpool striker got his first brace for the Catalans against Manchester City and back in La Liga action he reached double figures for his new club with a second half strike on Saturday.

He also played a part in Barca’s first and third goals as they moved back to within a point of Real Madrid who play on Sunday at home to Villarreal.

Kicking-off at 3pm has been a problem in the past for Barcelona. It’s traditionally siesta time all over Spain and they have been caught napping on the job enough times in their five mid-afternoon kick-offs to have dropped five of a possible 15 points. 

But there was no such snoozing against strugglers Granada and they were ahead after 25 minutes when the home side failed to deal with a Suarez cross-shot and the ball ran out to Rakitic who buried it past former Barca B keeper Oier Olazabal.

Gerard Pique was missing through suspension and Barcelona had Neymar booked in the second half. He will now miss their next league game against Rayo Vallecano. But both players will be happy to have got their suspensions out of the way ahead of next month’s clasico.

Luis Suarez said this week: ‘Madrid have to come to the Camp Nou. We can still close the gap’ and he was doing everything to help that cause getting his tenth goal in a Barcelona shirt on 48 minutes.

He started the move playing in Rakitic and he was slipped through by the Croatian midfielder to finish past Oier. 

Barcelona made things a little more difficult for themselves by giving away a second-half penalty. Marc Bartra fouled Lass and Fran Rico scored the spot-kick but Barcelona scored again to wrap up the three points.

When it came it was Suarez’ 13th assist of the season. Again Rakitic was at the heart of the goal playing in the Uruguayan who rolled the ball to Messi. The Argentine finished into an empty net and the Granada players complained with some justification, about the absence of an off-side flag.

Suarez was embraced by Messi. He then showed his frustration when taken off with 10 minutes left. He could be seen shaking his head on the bench after being deprived of the chance to add to his tally. He has made his name at Barcelona as a goal-giver but for the second game running his goal had been decisive in a Barcelona victory.
