11-year-old Louis Kearns, who gatecrashed Chelsea's Europa League celebrations, with fellow 'gatecrasher' John Terry

One is an imposter who gatecrashed Chelsea's Europa League cup celebrations. The other is John Terry.

Millions
of television viewers watched as 11-year-old Louis Kearns joined the 
Chelsea team on the podium as they went to collect the trophy.

He came inches from lifting it - and even shook hands with UEFA president Michel Platini.

Louis also found time to be 
photographed with fellow 'gatecrasher' Terry, who has been widely 
ridiculed for lifting the trophy in full kit despite not playing in his 
team's 2-1 win over Benfica on Wednesday because of injury.

The 11-year-old from Liverpool had earlier travelled with his father to the game in Amsterdam.

At the full-time whistle he managed to evade security to run on to the pitch for a photo with Fernando Torres and manager Rafael Benitez.

He then joined the rest of the squad on the march up the stairs of the Amsterdam ArenA to collect their medals, later posing for photographs with them before being evicted by security staff.

Louis's mother Margaret, who watched the match on television, told The Sun she could not believe what she was seeing.

She said: 'I nearly died when I saw him go to collect the trophy. I couldn’t believe it was him. Everybody was going mad on Twitter. I’m still in shock.

'I'm not sure how they got tickets, let alone how he nearly collected the cup.'

And like his idol Terry, who lifted the Champions League trophy last year despite being suspended for the final, it is not Louis' first attempt at gatecrashing.

The 11-year-old once sneaked on to the winners' podium at Silverstone racetrack.

His
aunt, Francesca Kearns, a fashion designer from Liverpool said: 'It was
just by chance that Louis was so close to the players.

'He was at the game with his dad and their seats were right by where the medals were handed out.

'He loves Torres so much from when he was a Liverpool player and was overjoyed to see him walk past.

'When he saw the opportunity to get close to his hero, he couldn't help himself and just got carried away in the excitement.

'We were all in fits of laughter watching it at home on TV, especially when he got a handshake from the UEFA President. He looked gutted he didn't get a medal though. His dad won't be able to live down letting him run off like that.'
