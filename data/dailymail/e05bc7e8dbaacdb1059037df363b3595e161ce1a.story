Ed Miliband will pledge to lower the voting age to 16, following the trial of the idea in the Scottish referendum.

The Labour leader, who has long been a supporter of an earlier voting age, is expected to use a speech at next week’s party conference to pledge that the policy will be included in his general election manifesto.

Such a move – the first change in the voting age since 1969 – would enfranchise more than 1.5million 16 and 17-year-olds.

Party sources believe that idealistic youngsters are more likely to vote Labour. The idea is also backed by the Liberal Democrats.

But polls show that the public, including most 16-year-olds, do not support the idea. It is also opposed by the Conservatives. A Labour source last night said that the policy’s place in the manifesto was ‘set in concrete’.

Shadow Justice Secretary Sadiq Khan said: ‘Despite warnings from the sceptics, 16- and 17-year-olds did come out and vote and engage in the big issues over the future of Scotland.

‘This is all the more reason why the voting age should be lowered for all elections as it is an idea whose time has come.

‘Labour has been calling for a lowering of the voting age for some time, and after the referendum there’s little reason why it shouldn’t be full steam ahead for all elections.’

Shadow Cabinet minister Jim Murphy, a leading figure in the No campaign in Scotland, said that Labour should now press for a change in the law in time for next year’s election.

Mr Murphy said the experiment in Scotland had ‘blown out of the water’ the idea that 16-year-olds were not engaged enough with politics to be trusted with the vote. 

‘They have been so engaged, so switched on,’ he said.

‘If there’s still time for the next election, let’s give 16- and 17-year-olds the vote. Otherwise, you’re going to have 16-year-old Scots, who have voted today in the biggest decision that will ever be taken, having to sit out and watch.’

The voting age in Britain was reduced from 21 to 18 in 1969.

Conservative Party chairman Grant Shapps dismissed calls to lower the voting age to 16 when the issue was raised last year.

Mr Shapps warned the move would ‘politicise the classroom, with votes for youngsters who are still at school’.

He also accused Labour of bowing to the demands of its union paymasters over the issue.

Last year Unite, which is Labour’s biggest donor, demanded that 16-year-olds should be given the vote. 

The union, run by Len McCluskey, said: ‘Young people should be given a stake in the political process by lowering the voting age to 16.’

An exit poll of just over 2,000 Scottish voters by Tory peer Lord Ashcroft showed that the 16 and 17-year-olds enfranchised for the first time by the Scottish referendum were overwhelmingly in favour of independence.

The small sample – which may not have been representative of teenagers overall – showed that 71 per cent of the age group voted Yes. In contrast, only 27 per cent of over-65s voted in favour of independence in Lord Ashcroft’s sample.

The figures suggest that school pupils are indeed more likely to vote for radical options placed in front of them.

But this did not carry through to the next age group – the split between Yes and No for 18- to 24-year-olds was virtually even in the exit poll.
