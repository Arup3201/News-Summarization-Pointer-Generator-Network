With distinctive white rings encircling its eyes, the silvereye looks just like one of the feathered stars of hit video game Angry Birds.

Thereâ€™s no computer wizardry at work here, though. The silvereye is a real-life eye-opener.

Also known as wax-eye, or white-eye, 
the diminutive birds can be found in New Zealand, as well as Australia 
and some of the southwest Pacific Islands, including Fiji.

Distinctive: The silvereye has a conspicuous white ring around the eye

They feed on a variety of foods, invertebrates, fruit, and nectar and will feed in flocks over winter in gardens and parks from bird tables, eating fats, cooked meats, and bread and sugar water.

Here they are pictured tucking into a tasty apple.

They feed on nectar courtesy of a specially adapted tongue, with bristles, which allows them to lap it up.

Causing a flap: The silvereye was first spotted in New Zealand in 1832

Diet: The species is partial to an apple or two

Silvereyes
 stay in pairs all year but in the winter they form big flocks, often 
flying at night in search of food.

As the breeding season approaches the
 pairs break away to form individual territories and the first year 
birds pair up. Prolific breeders, they raise two to three broods per 
season, with between two to five eggs per brood.

Both adults incubate for about 11 days 
and the chicks fledge at about 10 days. The young are independent at 
three weeks and will breed at about nine months old.

Here's looking at you: The silvereye's eyes are so bright they almost look painted on

Staying power: These little birds can live to 12 years old

They have recorded that these little birds can live up to 12 years.

The Silvereye was first recorded in New Zealand in 1832, but arrived in greater numbers in 1856.
