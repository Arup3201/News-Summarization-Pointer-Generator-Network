Here's a new kind of fast fashion - a zip up tie for men. The innovative fashion statement is draped round the neck and then the two sections are zipped up - which could save precious seconds for anyone late for a meeting and eliminates the need to re-tie it later in the day.

The tie costs £42 and comes in three different sizes and shades of blue and grey.

But even the designer, Josh Jakus, 
from Oakland, California, admits it won't be to everyone's taste and is 
more for those who want to 'assert their individuality'.

Time-saver: The zip up tie can be donned in seconds with no need to re-tie later in the day

He said: 'I don't think it will replace 
the original tie - there are a lot of people who would prefer to stick 
with the tradition - that's fine with me.'

Mr Jakus added that his tie is 'perfect for any occasion where you want to both look good and different at the same time'.

'A friend has worn the tie to government functions in Washington DC - and he didn't look out of place,' he said.

The 44 year old said the style also makes a great talking point when worn at parties.

Fast fashion: Designer Josh Jakus came up with the innovative fashion statement that allows men to zip and go

'When I wore the zip tie to a cocktail party recently I spent the whole evening talking about nothing else,' he said. 'The feedback has been great. One of my male friends initially hated the tie, but then a minute later he said he loved it. I took it as a huge compliment because it meant he had to think about the design - that's what I want my work to do.'

The product designer explained how he came up with the idea thanks to the surplus supplies of material his company had.

He said: 'My other designs are made with zippers and felt, and my company had surplus of both of these materials. I was trying to find a use for the extra material and started coming up with different ways to create a new and unique idea.

'At one point I put a zipper around my neck and the idea was born - it was pretty easy to figure it out from there.'

He said the ties, which will be available to buy online and from selected retailers are currently 'for all ages' but he hasn't ruled out a range for children.

'I haven't made a tie for kids yet, but I know a friend has bought one of the smaller sized ties for her son,' he said.
