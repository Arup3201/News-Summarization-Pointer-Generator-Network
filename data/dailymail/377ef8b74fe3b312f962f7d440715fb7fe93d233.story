The worst drought in history to hit California has forced wildlife officials to give millions of young Chinook salmon a ride to the Pacific Ocean.

With low water levels on the state's rivers, the fish are unable to complete their usual migration upstream.

Over the next two months, officials are now planning to gather up an estimated 30 million salmon and transport them in tankers towards the ocean in a bid to help them with migration.

After being transported some of the Chinnok salmon are dumped in a holding pen at the Mare Island Strait, California

The Department of Fish and Game often help out Chinook salmon migrate due to California's dry climate.

But this is the first time they have been moved in such numbers with the Fishery Foundation of California also drafted in to help out.

The fish will be taken from river hatcheries in Northern California to a spot on the lower Sacramento River near Rio Vista.

They will be transported in tanker trucks filled with river water and then released into holdings pens before being let out into the wild.

It has been reported that it will take 275 truckloads to transport all of the fish and will cost around $800,000 (Â£475,426).

The Chinook salmon are important to California's billion dollar commercial and recreational fishing industry.

Andrew Hughan, spokesman for the stateâ€™s Department of Fish and Wildlife told the Los Angeles Times: 'It is a Herculean effort to avoid disaster in three years.

'By disaster, I mean a collapse of the fishery industry; no commercial fishing and no recreational fishing.'

The recent drought in California has been so severe that in January Governor Jerry Brown declared a state of emergency due to increasing arid conditions, asking for a 20 per cent reduction in water use.

So far the drought has caused reservoirs and rivers to dry up, putting household water usage at risk.

Last year was the state's driest on record and it is said California has had the least amount of rainfall in its 163-year history.
