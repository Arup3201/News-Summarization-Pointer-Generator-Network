This is the dramatic moment a brave petrol station cashier fought off two masked robbers armed with a meat cleaver before chasing them out the shop with their own knife.

The two thugs ran into the garage and threatened terrified shop worker Trude Mian, 65, with the six inch blade and another knife.

One of the robbers grabbed Mrs Mian's wrist and held her at knife point as they forced her to hand over £50 from the till.

But when they demanded to see the safe plucky Mrs Mian told them they would have to get past her first before getting their hands on any more money.

Armed raid: The masked man ran into a garage with an accomplice and threatened shop worker Trude Mian, 65, with the sharp butcher's tool

Planned attack: The pair, wearing black balaclavas, burst into Knowle Garage, in Braunton, Devon, on Saturday evening shortly before the petrol station was about to close

Demanding cash: One of the men waves the six inch blade in the air while grabbing Mrs Mian's arm to force her to open the till. He then demanded to see the safe

Back at work: Trude Mian, 65, told the robbers they would have to get through her if they wanted more money

Mrs Mian, the wife of garage owner Khaliq Mian, said: 'They were shouting "give us your ******* money".

'One ran around the counter and I 
tried to dial 999 but he whacked the phone several times with his meat 
cleaver and then pushed me.'

The robbers then demanded that Mrs Mian show them safe but she refused - telling the thugs they would have to get past her first.

Mrs Mian managed to push the panic button under the counter and scared the robbers off.

The grandmother added: 'Unknown to them I didn't do it properly, but the other shouted "she has pressed the alarm" and they ran out.

'He left his knife on the counter so I picked it up and ran after them.

'If the chap with the meat cleaver 
should suddenly turn around, I thought I at least had something to 
defend myself with "I wanted to go down fighting if I had to go down at 
all".'

Mrs Mian then dialled 999 and the police have now released footage of 
the shocking attack.

The pair, wearing black balaclavas, burst into Knowle Garage, in Braunton, Devon, on Saturday evening at 10pm.

One carried the meat cleaver and the other a six inch knife, described by police as a Kitchen Devil chef's knife with an un-serrated edge, which Mrs Mian plucked off the counter.

A police spokesman said the weapon was about 30cm long with a blade of around 16cm.

Officers are appealing for information about the robbery which happened as the garage was about to close.

Det Insp Dave Atkinson, of Barnstaple CID, said a number of vital items had been recovered, including the meat cleaver.

He added: 'It is an unusual incident and a very nasty violent one, so the sooner we can lock these people up the better.

'It is a minor miracle Mrs Mian was not cut, she was very lucky.'

Amazingly Mrs Mian went straight back to work on Monday, despite being exhausted from her nightmare ordeal and a lack of sleep.

She said: 'I wanted to go straight back to face the demons. Everybody has been so kind -customers have been giving me flowers, it's very nice.

'The police have really been good and I think they deserve recognition for all their work.'

One of the men was wearing a grey Ultramagnetic brand hooded top and the other had very dark or black clothing and dark trainers with white stripes on the sides, police said.

Anyone with information is asked to contact police on 101 or Crimestoppers on 0800 555111.
