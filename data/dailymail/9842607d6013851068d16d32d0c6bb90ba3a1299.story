A father-of-two has won a $75,000 lawsuit against New York City claiming he was choked and unable to breathe during a 2013 encounter with police. 

Attorney Jeffrey Rothman said yesterday that the settlement for Brooklyn man Kevin Dennis-Palmer was 'another example of a black man choked and beaten down into the ground.'

He was approached by police officers while trying to parallel park his car outside his home on February 9, 2013.

He was then pepper-sprayed, lifted by his neck and slammed to the ground, according to his lawsuit. Charges brought against him alleging his windows were illegally tinted and he resisted providing driving credentials were later dropped

Mr Rothman said: 'He was trying to get his licence and registration, but he is a very large man and he was cramped in the car so he struggled to get out his licence,' Sky News reported.

'By the time he got his licence out, the sergeant lost his patience, pepper-sprayed him and they tried to drag him out of the car through the window.

'Then one of the officers slammed him to the ground and they tried to pick him up using a chokehold.'

The lawsuit was filed in May before the death of Eric Garner last summer, whose treatment by police and a grand jury decision not to indict any officers prompted nationwide protests.

Mr Garner, an asthma sufferer, died after a New York police officer placed him in an apparent chokehold during an arrest in July for selling loose cigarettes.

A widely seen video showed him gasping: 'I can't breathe,' as he was wrestled to the ground in Staten Island by police. 

Mr Rothman said the circumstances in Mr Dennis-Palmer's case were similar to those of the Garner case. 

A federal judge approved the settlement last week. New York City Law Department spokesman Nick Paolucci said that 'based on an evaluation of the case, it was determined that the settlement was in the best interests of the city.'

According to the lawsuit, he was ordered out of the car but could not immediately get out because of his large frame.

It was alleged that officers tried to pull him by his collar through a window and pepper sprayed him and slammed him to the street when he emerged from the car with his hands up.

Eric Garner died when he was arrested by NYPD officers, who put him in a chokehold. Officers have pointed out that Garner's size and health issues contributed

One of several officers who arrived at the scene lifted him up by his neck, choking him, as other officers struck him on the head and back, according to the lawsuit. 

Mr Dennis-Palmer, suffering from asthma, allegedly had difficulty breathing and screamed. 

'I'm yelling, 'I can't breathe — you're choking me!' Mr Dennis-Palmer told the New York Daily News.

According to the lawsuit, charges were brought against Mr Dennis-Palmer alleging that his car was stopped because his windows were illegally tinted and that he resisted turning over driving credentials.

Mr Rothman said the charges were later dropped, and Mr Dennis-Palmer was treated for a swollen eye and cuts to his wrist and head.

Mr Paolucci did not immediately respond Monday evening to an email seeking comment on Rothman's characterization of the case.
