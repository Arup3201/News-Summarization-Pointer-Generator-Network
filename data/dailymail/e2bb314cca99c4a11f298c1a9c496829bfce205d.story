Lee Selby's maiden world title challenge will be against Evgeny Gradovich after the Russian held on to his IBF featherweight title with a draw against Jayson Velez.

After an entertaining 12 rounds in Oklahoma, the judges were split with one in favour of the champion, one the challenger and one settling on a draw which saw Gradovich retain his belt.

Selby is his mandatory challenger after his impressive victory over Joel Brunker last month.

The Welshman was ringside on Saturday and can expect his shot to come early in the new year.

On the same card, Terence Crawford defended his WBO lightweight title with a one-sided points win over Raymundo Beltran.

Crawford, who won the belt from Scotland's Ricky Burns earlier this year, is unbeaten in 25 fights and will now move up to light welterweight.

'I felt he was slowing down,' he said. 'I didn't want to get careless. I just stuck with what was working.

'I saw his eyes swollen but I just stuck to the game plan.

'This is it for the lightweight division. 'I’ve been at 135lb since I was 17. I am 27 now. It is time to move up.'
