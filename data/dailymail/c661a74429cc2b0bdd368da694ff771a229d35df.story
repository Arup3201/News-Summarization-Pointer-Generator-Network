The Federal Bureau of Investigations must offer a federal judge a better explanation as to why it is refusing to give information to a graduate student researching an alleged plot to kill 'Occupy' leaders in Texas, the judge hearing the case ruled last week.

Judge Rosemary M. Collyer of the U.S. District Court for the District of
 Columbia wrote in her ruling that the reason the FBI gave for denying Massachusetts Institute of Technology graduate student Ryan Noah Shapiro access to key pieces of information in heavily redacted documents was not sufficient, and a better explanation must be provided if the Bureau continues to refuse to share the information.

Shapiro is researching an alleged sniper plot to kill leaders of a Houston-based spin-off of the 'Occupy' movement. He sued the FBI after submitting a Freedom of Information Act request with the Bureau and getting back the heavily redacted documents.

FOIA: Ryan Shapiro says the FBI is violating the Freedom of Information Act by withholding certain information he requested

The FBI claims the information Shapiro is asking for is exempt under FOIA. Shapiro disagrees, and feels the FBI is violating FOIA regulations. 

The plot to kill 'Occupy' leaders first was discovered in documents released to a civil rights organization in Washington D.C. as part of a separate FOIA request. The documents released by the FBI referenced a 'plan to kill the leadership via suppressed sniper rifles.

It's unclear who was behind this alleged plot, and whether it was ever investigated by the FBI.

The FBI is granted certain leeway under FOIA - it is allowed to withhold 'information compiled for law enforcement purposes' if disclosing it would interfere with ongoing investigations or endanger lives.

Not impressed: Judge Rosemary Collyer says the FBI needs to provide more information about why it is refusing to hand over the information

According to the Washington Post, the exemption 'was repeatedly cited by FBI FOIA chief David Hardy in a filing to the 
court in support of an FBI motion to dismiss Mr. Shapiro’s lawsuit. Some
 information was redacted, according to Mr. Hardy’s filing, because it 
involved information shared with local law enforcement agencies related 
to an investigation of “potential criminal activity by protestors 
involved with the Occupy movement in Houston.'”

Possible crimes cited by Hardy include 'domestic terrorism' and 'advocating overthrow of the government.'

That vague explanation was not enough for Judge Collyer.

Occupy: The information is in regard to an alleged plot to assassinate leaders of an Occupy movement in Houston

'At no point does Mr. Hardy supply specific facts as to the basis for 
FBI’s belief that the Occupy protestors might have been engaged in 
terroristic or other criminal activity,' she wrote in her ruling. 'Neither the word 
‘terrorism’ nor the phrase "advocating the overthrow of the government" 
are talismanic, especially where FBI purports to be investigating 
individuals who ostensibly are engaged in protected First Amendment 
activity.'

Judge Collyer has given the FBI until April 9 to provide a more satisfactory explanation of its withholding of the information by April 9. Collyer is allowing the agency to file its response under seal.
