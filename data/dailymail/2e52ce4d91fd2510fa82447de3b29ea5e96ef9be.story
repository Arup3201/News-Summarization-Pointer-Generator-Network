His career as a powerful Democratic politician was cut short by his loyalty to mobster brother Whitey Bulger.

But despite his forced retirement from the upper echelons of Boston life, William Bulger says he still visits his convicted murderer brother every week.

It is typical of their relationship that has seen William Bulger remain publicly steadfast to his brother despite the damage to his career.

Former president of the Massachusetts Senate William Bulger (left) has revealed he visits his mobster brother James 'Whitey' Bulger (right) in prison once a week in a show of continued loyalty

He was forced to resign as president of the University of Massachusetts system in 2003 and has kept a low profile since. 

But his silence has led to persistent 
rumours that he knew more than he let on during Whitey Bulger's 16 years on the run.

In a rare interview, the former president of the Massachusetts Senate said he just wants to be 'a brother' to Whitey and visits him weekly.

William Bulger told WCVB: 'Just 
because I visit him, doesn't mean I condone it'.

However, he refused to 
specify what he meant by 'it', saying he does not 'know what is true or 
not'.

Whitey Bulger was captured in 2011 and has now been jailed for life after a 40-year career of 
murder, extortion, money-laundering, arms trafficking and drug dealing.

His notoriety and list of crimes and corrupt dealings with the FBI created large shadows over William Bulger.

In 1970 the younger brother won a Senate seat and eight 
years later was elected Senate president by the 40-member chamber, a 
position he would hold for a record 17 years.

But his relationship to a suspected multiple murderer eventually forced his resignation in 2003.

Among those pressing William Bulger to resign from his university post was then-Republican Governor Mitt Romney.

His decision came after he testified before a congressional committee investigating the FBI's ties to his brother, who by then had been revealed as an FBI informant.

After receiving immunity, William acknowledged receiving a call from Whitey shortly after he fled.

The tone of it was "Don't believe everything that is being said about me,"' William Bulger said.

'I think he asked me to tell everybody he was OK. ... I think I said I hope this has a happy ending.'

Two years earlier, William Bulger had told a grand jury he didn't urge his brother to surrender because he didn't 'think it would be in his interest to do so,' according to a transcript of his testimony obtained by The Boston Globe.

'It's my hope that I'm never helpful to anyone against him,' the younger Bulger said, according to the transcript.

'I don't feel an obligation to help everyone to catch him.'

William Bulger did not attend his brother's trial but was at court for his arraignment.

During the brief appearance in federal court, Whitey smiled at his younger brother and mouthed the word 'Hi.' William smiled back.

Speaking briefly to reporters as he left the courthouse after his brother's arraignment - the first time they had seen each other in 16 years -  the former state Senate president appeared emotional.

'It's an unusual experience,' he said.

Commentators on the case say William Bulger not only sacrificed his own career, but chose loyalty over stopping bloodshed.

Dick Lehr, co-author of 'Whitey: The Life Of America's Most Notorious Mob Boss', points out that it was Unabomber Ted Kaczynski's brother David who eventually led to him being caught.

He told the New York Times: 'The Kaczynski brother decided it was more important that his brother be captured and not kill any more than to stay loyal to him.

'Bill Bulger, in the face of a God-awful amount of horror, has made a different choice.'

Despite being damned by association, William Bulger insists it has been worse for his family, wife, Mary, and their nine children.

He told WCVB: 'I've had a whole lifetime of this.'
