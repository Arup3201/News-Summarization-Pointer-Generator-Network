An elderly Melbourne workman is lucky to be alive after spending half an hour dangling upside down from a three-storey building.

It's believed the 84-year-old was doing some maintenance work when he locked himself out and decided to climb over to another balcony, Seven News reported.

But instead, he tripped and jammed his foot on the side railing of the balcony - which saved him from a 12 metre fall.

Police officers held onto the man's legs until firefighters arrived and rescued him to safety.

He was reportedly taken to hospital in a stable condition, suffering a sore ankle.
