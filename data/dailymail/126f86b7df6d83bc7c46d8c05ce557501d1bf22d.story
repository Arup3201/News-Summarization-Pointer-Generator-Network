From Wayne Rooney to James Nesbitt, the list of celebrity men who have resorted to hair transplants to revitalise their balding manes is a long one.

As a result, inquiries about the treatment have shot up by 260 per cent over the last 12 months while 59 per cent of men say they would consider the treatment if they started losing their hair.

But as Michael Avola, 49, an unemployed former martial arts champion from Northampton knows only too well, the fiddly surgery doesn't always go to plan.

Botched: Michael Avola, 49, was left bald and scarred following six bungled hair transplant operations

Embarrassed: Mr Avola, who is unemployed, said his confidence was wrecked by the bungle

After he began losing his hair - and his confidence - at the age of 23, he turned to surgery in a bid to fix the problem.

But six operations and £7,000 later, Mr Avola was left badly scarred and still bald.

'They promised me there would be a 
really good result,' he reveals. 'They said the scarring would be invisible and that there would
 be full coverage at the front.'

Instead, after a bungling surgeon botched the operation, Mr Avola was left with a small amount of wiry regrowth and a front section without any hair on it at all.

'It
 looked horrendous,' he adds. 'It was growing like wire. Emotionally, I was just 
broken.'

The complex surgery, which involves carefully removing and then re-implanting up to 1500 delicate hair follicles, was repeated five times before Mr Avola conceded defeat.

Shockingly, despite confronting the inept medic, the clinic refused to refund his money or compensate him for the damage.

'I went back and explained to them that, really, they'd wrecked 
my life and nothing happened,' he explains.

He adds: 'Every day, when I leave the house, I try to wear a hat if I can help it. You go through all the emotions... You get embarrassed, you get angry because you think, "How could I do such a stupid thing?"'

Mr Avola, who appears in the latest episode of Channel 5 documentary, Botched Up Bodies, is now attempting to repair the damage by consulting another surgeon but may have to wait up to 18 months before his mangled hair grows back.

'I would have expected to see a lot more hair growing on his head considering the amount of surgery he's had,' comments Manchester-based hair restoration surgeon, Dr Bessam Farjo.

'I think the operations Michael has had, certainly in my opinion, are below par. One, because he's had multiple scars where he should have had one or two scars.

'Second, because there's not enough hairs growing from one operation, let alone six, and thirdly, the hairs that are growing, the size of the grafts, the angles and directions are not giving him a natural appearance.'

Although Mr Avola has since had a seventh operation in the professional hands of Dr Farjo, he still has more than a year to go before finding out whether his hopes of a full head of hair will be realised.

'It's been an improvement and hopefully it will progress a bit more,' he says, adding: 'I'm very excited about the future.'
