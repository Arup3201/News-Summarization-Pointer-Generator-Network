Roberto Martinez has revealed that he hopes to sign a winger with Chelsea's Christian Atsu his immediate target.

Everton have so far added Gareth Barry, Muhamed Besic and Romelu Lukaku to their first-team squad during the summer transfer window.

And now the Everton manager is looking to further strengthen his options by recruiting a wide player.

Speaking after the 1-1 draw in Leon Osman's testimonial with FC Porto on Sunday, Martinez told evertontv: 'Hopefully we will have another new player coming in.

'We are looking for a wide player that is going to help us in a position that we need to strengthen going into the season.

'We are going to take as long as we need but hopefully it will be earlier rather than later.'

Martinez also confirmed that Everton are close to tying up a deal for Belgian teenager David Henen.

Should the forward complete his move from Anderlecht, he will train and play with Everton's Under-21s squad.

Martinez continued: 'David is only a young man and I we believe this is the perfect environment for him to develop and fulfil his potential and we would love to find a way to sign him. But that doesn't mean he's going to go into the first-team at all.

'He's a young promising footballer and we think he would be perfect for the group of Under-21s that we have created.'
