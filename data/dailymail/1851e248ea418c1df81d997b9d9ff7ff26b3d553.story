A 5-year old boy outside of Atlanta set his grandmother's house ablaze after what started as innocent play with cigarette lighter quickly got out of control.

Playing in his room with the lighter, the little boy panicked once the fire began to spread and ran out to alert his grandmother of the danger.

Unable to extinguish the flames herself, she called in the local fire department, who arrived to see huge clouds of black smoke billowing from the house.

'The little boy came screaming out of his room that the house was on 
fire,' a representative of the Cherokee County Fire Department told The Atlanta Journal-Constitution.

His grandmother tried to put out the flames with a bucket of water, but they had already grown too large to be extinguished by her, the representative reported.

An investigation by the department 
later revealed that the fire was started by the boy playing with the 
cigarette lighter in his bedroom closet on the first floor of the house.

The firefighters were able to put out the blaze by entering the home through the second-story window.

No one was injured, though the two-story house was damaged by the smoke, fire, and water.

This incident comes a few months after another fire in the area, also caused by a child playing with a lighter, claimed the life of four children.

This past January a blaze caused by a cigarette lighter quickly spread through a duplex and claimed the lives of 4 siblings, 8-month old Deon Glass, 3-year old Amoni Roberts, 7-year old 
Dar'Shawn Glass, and 9-year old Ah'Dariya Glass. 

The children's mother, 28-year old Reba Glass, desperately tried to save her children, but only succeed in rescuing one of them.

Glass managed to save her 6-year old son by throwing him out of a second floor window, according to a report from MyFoxAtlanta.com. 

She suffered severe burns on 40 percent of her body.

It was later discovered by investigators that the 6-year old boy was the one who accidentally set the fire by playing with a lighter.

No charges were pressed against the 6-year old boy. Instead he was turned over to the 
Division of Family and Children Services for fire safety counseling, reported WSBTV.com.
