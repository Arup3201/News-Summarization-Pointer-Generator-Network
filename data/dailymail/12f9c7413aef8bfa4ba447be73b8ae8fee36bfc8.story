Marc Wroe urinated into a female colleague's water bottle during a seven-year campaign of harassment after she rejected his advances

A spurned worker urinated into a female colleague's water bottle during a seven-year campaign of harassment after she rejected his advances.

Marc Wroe, 44, sent his victim soiled underwear and turned up uninvited at her home late at night during the campaign, a court heard.

He is now facing jail after admitting a charge of harassment without violence at a hearing at Preston Magistrates’ Court, Lancashire.

The court heard he told police it was 'in revenge' for his affections being rejected.

Martine Connah, prosecuting, said: 'She thought he was trying to play a twisted, perverted game.'

The victim, a mother-of-one who works at hydraulics distribution company Tom Parker Ltd, in Preston, started receiving emails from Wroe in 2007.

During a catalogue of disturbing incidents, the victim received solied ladies underwear in the post, had lingerie catalogues and samples addressed to her, received Valentine's cards addressed to her partner posted to her home and was disturbed late at night while alone with her daughter when Wroe turned up unannounced.

The court heard she also received 'apology' flowers and was stared at as she got into her car when leaving work.

Ms Connah said: 'The emails became more and more frequent. She asked him to stop. At some point he gave her his home email address.

'She emailed him at home asking him not to send her so many messages at work. She was not interested in him, not attracted to him.

'He continued to email her at home and work. They got more and more explicit and on one occasion, he commented on an item of underwear he had seen in her bag, which was actually her little girl’s. It was unnerving.'

The court heard after an incident in which Wroe turned up at her home, a colleague warned him off.

But the victim felt like he was watching her every move. She eventually told her partner everything after catching him staring at her as she got into her car.

She reported him to her boss after she received stockings at her home - labelled with his name.

A boss at Tom Parker Ltd spoke to Wroe, but he said he too had been receiving things and tried to blame an ex-girlfriend.

In February this year, the victim noticed a foul smell coming from her drinking water.

Ms Connah said: 'She went to the director, and was shaking. She felt awful she could work with someone who hated her so much.'

When it happened again, tests showed her water was contaminated and the firm set up cameras on April 26.

On April 29, Wroe, of Preston, was caught contaminating the water sat on her desk. He was sacked.

Greg Earnshaw, defending, said: 'It is a shameful act. He is highly embarrassed and owned up to it straight away.'

The case was adjourned to July 11 to allow for a medical report after District Judge Jane Goodwin said she had 'great concern'.

The victim did not wish to comment after the case.
