Former Premier League star David James has taken a swipe at David de Gea and Hugo Lloris by questioning their ability to keep clean sheets.

James, speaking on BT Sport before Tottenham's home match against Manchester United, also said he did not know why Real Madrid are interested in De Gea as 'Keylor Navas is better' than the Spaniard.

'Navas is better than De Gea,' said James. 'Real Madrid do not need a top goalkeeper.'

When comparing De Gea and Lloris with former Manchester United 'keeper Peter Schmeichel, he replied: 'The thing about Schmeichel was that he kept clean sheets.

'Lloris and De Gea have kept nine Premier League clean sheets in 36 games (18 each) between them this season.'

The 44-year-old BT pundit went on to say he was a fan of Lloris, especially during the festive period.

He added: 'I'm a big fan of Lloris. Very bouncy, especially At Christmas.'

Fellow BT pundit Owen Hargreaves, on the other hand, said Lloris and De Gea have been Tottenham and Manchester United's best players so far this season.
