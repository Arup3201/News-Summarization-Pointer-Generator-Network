Men claiming to be Buddhist Monks are joining the Elmos, Mickey Mouses and other costumed characters asking for money from tourists in Times Square.

With shaved heads and orange robes, the fortune-seekers are from Chinese descent and offer wishes of peace as they ask for donations along the heaving stretch of Manhattan.

The apparent monks, and a smaller number of women in similar dress, show a picture of a temple, suggesting the funds are intended towards that, and carry an notebook full of other donors' names.

Angry: As begging in the street isn't against 
the law, there's not a great deal the police can do about the 
panhandlers, seen left and right, which has angered Buddhist leaders

However, it's not clear whether they are genuine monks or imposters out to make a quick buck.

According to the New York Times, a number of Buddhists have confronted the men with questions about the religion but they simply walk away.

The NYPD have stepped in on occasion when the monks have become aggressive, the Times reports.

At least nine people claiming to be monks have been arrested this year on charges of aggressive begging or unlicensed vending.

According to the Times, they offer the tourist the amulet and perhaps a bracelet but if the donation isn't enough, they'll angrily demand $20 or more.

However, as begging in the street isn't against the law, there's not a great deal the police can do, which has angered Buddhist leaders.

'They are damaging the reputation of real monks and damaging the reputation of Buddhists in America,' Shi Ruifa, who is president of a confederation of nearly 50 temples.

They've now become so prolific that they've inspired a Fake Monks in New York City Facebook page to record their movements.

The Times followed one apparent monk as he left Times Square at the end of a day's soliciting and walked into a public rest room where he got changed into street clothes and then went to share a jug of red wine with a friend.

While begging is an accepted ritual in the Buddhist faith, doing so aggressively is unheard of as is selling amulets or bracelets.
