Juventus were never in for Liverpool striker Mario Balotelli, insists the Italian club's general director Beppe Marotta.

The former Manchester City forward was linked with a move from AC Milan to their Serie A rivals, but the 24-year-old made the switch from the San Siro to Anfield instead for £16million. 

And Marotta, whose club have won three from three without conceding this season, insists Juventus were never interested in signing Balotelli.

'Balotelli? He has never been our target. We have never negotiated for him,' Marotta told Radio Uno.

'In January if we need to do so then we will make corrective measures. We are happy with the group at the disposal of Allegri, we are competitive in Italy and even in Europe, where there are other clubs stronger than us.

'I have heard criticism of our defence, but if I am not mistaken, after three games we have not conceded a goal.

'In recent years, Juventus' appeal has returned to what it was in the past. Years ago, (Udinese forward Antonio) Di Natale would not come, but now champions are willingly doing so.

'We have created a structure, with (sporting director Fabio) Paratici that allows us to take advantage of opportunities in the market.'
