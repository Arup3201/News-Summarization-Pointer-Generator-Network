Disgusting: The live maggot Amanda Cooper found crawling across her Tesco Value potatoes

A disgusted mother got more than she bargained for when she opened up her tin of Tesco Value potatoes - only to find a live maggot crawling inside.

Teaching assistant Amanda Cooper was preparing dinner for her children Aidan, 12, and Abby, 10, when she saw the bug wriggling across what was supposed to be their meal.

Ms Cooper, 33, bought the 15p tin, which had a sell-by date of March 2017, from a Tesco Express store near her home in Cambridge.

'It was horrible,' she said. 'When you buy a tin of something which has been processed in what you think is a clean environment, you expect to get just what you want.

'It put me right off. It was a Saturday afternoon sausage and broccoli dinner, just something easy for a Saturday.

'I buy the tin occasionally to back up my cupboards, just to have as a staple.

'In the end they just had the sausage and broccoli. I kept schtum about it until after we had eaten, but when Aidan saw the tin he was absolutely horrified.'

Ms Cooper returned the tin to the store, was given her money back and told told that someone would be in touch.

'I was happy with the way they dealt with it in-store, but I am really put off buying any tinned stuff now, and I won't be shopping in Tesco any time soon.

'When you buy lettuce or fresh food you wash your salad as you might get little things there where it's straight out of a field into the shop, but when you have got something processed that has been tinned it opens all sorts of questions.'

Put off: Ms Cooper says she is now wary of buying tinned food and will not be shopping at Tesco again soon

A Tesco spokeswoman said: 'We set ourselves high standards for the quality of the food we sell and were disappointed to hear of this incident.

'We have contacted our supplier to investigate and our customer service team will update Miss Cooper with the findings.'Â
