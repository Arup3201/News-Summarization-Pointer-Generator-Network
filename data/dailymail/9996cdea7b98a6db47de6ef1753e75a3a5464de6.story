British cyclist Sir Chris Hoy's spectacular Olympic gold medal win is now marred with controversy after a teammate said he deliberately fell in an earlier round because he was losing.

The 36-year-old cyclist equalled iconic Olympian Sir Steve Redgrave's record ­British tally of five gold medals as he powered to victory in the men’s team sprint.

It was one of three golds for Team GB yesterday, who also set a world record in the event.

However, moments after he was 
honoured with the medal, one of Hoy's own teammates claimed he had 
deliberately fallen from his bike in an earlier round.

Despite the claims, the International Olympic Committee (IOC) said Britain's gold medal would stand.

Asked if they would look at the 
result, IOC communications director Mark Adams said: 'At present there 
are no plans to do so. Our view is that people were not deprived of a 
contest.

'I have spoken to 
the Union Cycliste Internaionale (UCI) and they are obviously aware of 
the situation. At at this stage they don't see any reason to question 
the result and neither do we.'

Tumble: Hindes later said that his fall was 'all planned, really'

The British team was allowed to restart the qualifier after German-born Philip Hindes crashed seconds into the race.

The trio went on to post a world record time and later won the final against France.

Hindes, 19, suggested the crash was part of a deliberate ploy because the British team had made a poor start.

He
 said after winning gold: 'We were saying if we have a bad start, we 
need to crash to get a restart. I just crashed, I did it on purpose to 
get a restart, just to have the fastest ride. I did it. So it was all 
planned, really.'

The International Cycling Union 
confirmed that the incident had been reviewed at the time and the result
 was not in question - so all three British cyclists will keep their 
gold medals.

Silver
 medallists France said the action was not against the rules so they 
will not dispute the result, but they said it left a 'bitter' taste and 
they called for a change in the way such incidents are handled.

French technical director Isabelle 
Gautheron told Reuters: 'The team sprint regulations should be changed. 
We need more clarity.

'But the best team won, they beat the
 world record twice, they deserved their victory. They played with the 
rules. When you crash in the team sprint, it's considered as a false 
start.'

Last night, British Cycling categorically denied the fall was any part of a plan and said Hindes's comments were 'lost in translation' from a man who began learning English only after moving to Manchester from his native Germany two years ago.

Hindes himself subsequently denied it was deliberate during a post-race press conference when asked about his earlier comments.

'No,' he said, 'I just went out the gate and just lost control, just fell down.

'My back wheel slipped and totally lost control and then I couldn’t handle the bike any more and just crashed.'

Hoy is now tied with Sir Steve Redgrave with five gold medals – the most by 
any British Olympian.

Hoy was in tears as Princess Anne 
presented him with a fifth gold of his career, a second for Kenny and a 
first for Hindes, 19, who competed for Germany, the country of his 
birth, as a junior and joined Team GB earlier this year, qualifying 
because his father is British.

‘It’s quite overwhelming,’ Hoy said. 
‘We knew it was possible but it’s easier said than done for everyone to 
come good on the same day.
