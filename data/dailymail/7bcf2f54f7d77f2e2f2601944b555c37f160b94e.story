James Cunneely, 37, had an affair with his 15-year-old student but says he was abused by his teacher

A French teacher who had a sexual relationship with his 15-year-old student has claimed he also had an all-consuming two year affair with his female teacher when he was just 15.

James Cunneely, 37, a former teacher at Kittatinny Regional High School in New Jersey, was sentenced to three years in state prison for having sexual relations with a 15-year-old female student.

Cunneely, a father-of-three, was arrested in 2007 after a five-month relationship with the girl.

He admitted having 15 to 20 sexual relations with the girl - at motels, in his car, and even when her mother was at her home. 

The former Kittatinny Teacher of the Year, said the pair became close after she got upset in his classroom following a problem with her father.

And he has now told NJ.com, that when he was 15 his own French teacher allegedly began to abuse him.

Cunneely said he is speaking out because she has never been held to account for her alleged actions and because she has continued to work with children.

'I took responsibility for what I did,' he said. 

'I betrayed many people. I hurt many people. The same is true for her. I want her to be held responsible.'

Carol D'Annunzio, a 42-year-old woman, had consoled him after the death of his best friend's mother in 1991 and gave him her phone number, according to Cunneely. 

Explain the start of their alleged relationship he said: 'I'd be lying if I said it didn't feel special in a way.'

'I'm a 15-year-old boy, and she's taking this interest in my life. How could I not make that phone call?'

He said the talks, which lasted hours, were innocent until D'Annunzio, now 62, told him she loved him, which he felt compelled to say back to her.

Later that week Cunneely claimed he was walking with D'Annunzio at Lenape Valley when she turned, stopped him and kissed him for the first time.

He says she invited him to her apartment in Jefferson, saying she had a Christmas present - it was then their relationship turned sexual and over the next two years, they would have sex hundreds of times, including at school.

He said during a student exchange program in Paris he slept in the same bed as D'Annunzio after she told her friend who they stayed with that he was her nephew - all the other students stayed with host families.

He says his parents were unaware and even thought D'Annunzio was a stable presence in his life.

When he was released, Cunneely (pictured) went to confront D'Annunzio - she is now a substitute teacher in Florida where she lives with her husband

But he says the affair and the secrets began to take a toll and he lost interest in life and sometimes didn't even wash.

He says he tried to break up with D'Annunzio, but she became hysterical and threatened to tell his parents.

They finally split up and he remained in her class during which time she treated him like all the other students. 

Cunneely went on to marry his wife and has two daughters, who are 16 and 12 and a 14-year-old son, but says he was unhappy.

'Everyone thought, "Hey, Jim Cunneely. He's a nice guy, well-adjusted, wife and kids and teacher of the year and a good coach,'' he said.

'But inside was this incredible gut-wrenching turmoil. When I was 15, I felt smothered because I was living for someone else, and when I was 30, I felt smothered because I was living out someone else's life.' 

He then became involved with his victim and even attended therapy sessions with her.

When his victim told her mother he did panic, but the situation was resolved when he told her he loved her daughter and that he would not hurt her. 

He insists he did not ask his victim to keep their affair a secret as that is what he struggled with as a teenager during his alleged ordeal  - he says it was his determination to not kept their relationship a secret that led the girl to confide in a friend, who told a teacher, who contacted authorities.

The mother declined to comment, reports NJ.com.

Cunneely was arrested and sent to jail despite a letter written by the girl as well as plea that she made in a victim impact statement asking that he not be incarcerated.

The victim suffered bullying at school and was forced to move away.

Cunneely's family suffered - without his income or health benefits, his wife and children lost their home to foreclosure - he has now split up with his wife.

When he was released, Cunneely went to confront D'Annunzio - she is now a substitute teacher in Florida where she lives with her husband. 

He said he demanded an explanation and an apology, but received neither - that was when he told her was writing a book about their affair and its impact on his life. 

After inquiries by NJ Advance Media, the Sussex County Prosecutor's Office has opened a criminal investigation into D'Annunzio, authorities confirmed and have been interviewing potential witnesses.

First Assistant Prosecutor Gregory Mueller, who is overseeing the probe, said the statute of limitations would not bar the prosecution of D'Annunzio if investigators find corroborating evidence.

When the newspaper contacted D'Annunzio she did not respond.
