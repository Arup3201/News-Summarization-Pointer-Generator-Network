A pensioner was stunned when he stepped outside his front door and almost walked into a six-foot wide spider web spread across his drive.

Russell Harding, 74, was horrified to find the giant web, which stretched from his car’s wing mirror to his shed, had a huge inch-and-a-half spider sat in the middle.

Mr Harding, of Colerne, Wiltshire, said he was 'mystified' by the creation and how the spider managed to span such a distance.

'I don't understand how the spider did it, it was incredible,' he said. 'I'm just mystified.

'Mystified': The pensioner couldn't believe his eyes when he stepped outside and saw the six-foot web, which appears even bigger in the angle of this photograph

Huge: This spider, measuring an inch-and-half, sat in the middle of a giant web in front of  Rusell Harding's garage door

'It was right across the path way, I had to move it to walk through, I managed to detach it from my wing mirror and move it 90 degrees to a bin so it was still in tact but we could leave our house.

'The spider itself was about an inch-and-a-half wide, we think it was a she because of the size, she was very big.

'I have never seen a web that big before.

'My wife would have actually passed out if she had walked into the web. There would have been a lot of screaming.

Mr Harding took the web, which stretched from his car’s wing mirror to his shed, and moved it 90 degrees  

'Fortunately it had been a very dewy morning which highlighted the web so I saw it before I walked into it.'

The web, which appeared overnight last Thursday, disappeared after three days.

Lawrence Bee, of the British Arachnological Society, said: 'It’s almost certainly a garden spider (Araneus diadematus) which are extremely common throughout the UK at this time of year, spinning its large orb web in amongst shrubs and bushes in gardens and the wider countryside.' 

False widows: Britain's most venomous spider

While garden spiders are completely harmless, there has been a spate of serious spider attacks in recent weeks, predominantly from false widows - Britain's most venomous spider.

Much of their reputation is thought to be thanks to the black widow, which although similarly named is far more dangerous and has been known to kill children, ill or elderly people. 

Although its bites can be intensely uncomfortable - swelling hugely when infected - the false widow (above) is not known to have caused any deaths in Britain.

By comparison, around four Britons each year are though to die from bee or wasp stings when they have an allergic reaction.

False widow spiders are distinctive with their shiny, black flesh, bulbous bodies, thick legs and skull-like patterns.

Millions of false widows, Britain's most venomous spider, are found across the UK and the population is growing.

Also known by its Latin name Steatoda Nobilis, its first British sighting was in Torquay, Devon, in 1879 and is thought to have remained largely in southern England.

But the Natural History Museum says warmer summers mean the spider is spreading north, a theory backed by wildlife sightings. 

Eugene Murphy, from Dublin, was bitten three times on the shoulder and soon stopped breathing and went into cardiac arrest.

And Shireen Larson, 33, from Enfield, Middlesex, was bitten in pub garden and rushed to hospital after her leg turned black, yellow and blistered.
