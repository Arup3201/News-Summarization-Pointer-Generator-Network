A teenager was just two weeks from death after he was turned into an anorexic by playground bullies who teased him about his weight.

Kyle Carter, 17, battled the condition for four years and saw his weight drop to five stone.

Kyle, of South Shields, Tyne and Wear, started losing weight after he was tormented by bullies about putting on weight when he was just 11 years old.

Battle: Kyle Carter was just two weeks from death when he developed anorexia after playground bullies teased him for putting on weight (left). While he was anorexic (right) he plummeted to just 5st

He started refusing to eat and was later sectioned under the Mental Health Act.

Up to seven medics would have to hold him down and feed him by tube.

Kyle is now back to full health and says he wants to use his experience to help others and raise the profile of anorexia among boys.

He said: 'Six or seven people would have to hold me down. Looking back now I realise it had to happen - I wasn’t going to eat.

'I was two weeks from death. I wouldn’t be here if they hadn’t done that. 

'Now I have recovered I need to share my story, because I can turn my struggles into a positive. Today I can look in the mirror and love what I see.'

Kyle’s ordeal began at the age of 11 after playground bullies taunted him about his body, making him believe he would soon grow too fat for his school uniform.

He recalled: 'There was this new kid who turned up in the last year of primary school and he called me a fatty. 

'It
 happened on a number of occasions and I think that was the trigger 
really. It got to the point where I wanted to stop going to school.

'It really started to get to me. Then when I went to secondary school someone else called me a fatty.

As his confidence plummeted, he became too scared to look in a mirror and began watching what he would eat.

It wasn’t long before he virtually stopped eating and his weight started to plummet.

He
 was diagnosed with anorexia in early 2010, at the age of 14, and a 
short time later he was sectioned under the Mental Health Act.

Kyle, who is currently studying for a health and social care diploma, said: 'A big turning point came when I was scared to put on my school uniform because I was afraid it would be too tight.

'The more weight I lost, the more overweight I felt I was - that’s the way it works.

'Looking in the mirror became a big problem, because my body image was horrific. It spiralled out of control after that.

'I was overrun by the eating disorder. I was 90 per cent eating disorder, 10 per cent me.'

He added: 'I lost so much weight I wasn’t allowed to go to school any more.

At the height of his illness, Kyle had to be held down by medics while he was tube fed

'The
 longer it went on, the more weight I started to lose. After a while I was sent to a specialist hospital in 
Scotland. I was taken by ambulance and I literally had to be chained in 
the back of the ambulance to stop me trying to escape.

'I was not Kyle any more, and my mum and dad were told I was just two weeks from death.

'I was gradually weaned off the tube feed, and they introduced snacks slowly. It was hard. I was crying when I had my first meal, but things gradually got easier.'

His condition also put a huge strain on his parents, Andrea Welsh and David Carter, both 40, and his little sister Kara, now seven.

His mother said: His mum said: 'He was under six stone at one point, which for a boy is really low. It stunted his growth.

'His hair fell out, his skin would flake off, and he didn’t want to get showered. It was incredibly stressful.'

Positive: Kyle is hoping to use his experience to help others suffering with eating disorders, and regularly posts Facebook updates about his struggles

Kyle is now hoping to use his experience 
to help others suffering with eating disorders, and regularly posts 
Facebook updates about his struggles.

Now weighing a healthy 9st 12lbs, he said: 'Now I have recovered I need to share my story, because I can turn my struggles into a positive.'

Kyle said: 'On reflection, it’s scary to think how much of a hold the illness had over me - the things I was doing just weren’t me, it was crazy.

'As soon as I was released from the hospital and I got home I started refusing food again - I took advantage of the control I had which I regret on reflection, but it just wasn’t me. 

'It’s so hard to get over eating disorders and I have now set up several support groups to try and help others going through it.

'I love helping people and I hope I can continue to give people advice to battle the illness.'
