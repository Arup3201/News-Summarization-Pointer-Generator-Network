The results of an experiment on the ISS to monitor how ants cope with zero-gravity has been published.

Researchers found they managed surprisingly well, using other ants or the surfaces and walls as anchors to climb.

However, their ability to search collectively did not go perfectly as they tumbled and fell while trying to explore.

The study, Collective Search by Ants in Microgravity, was published in the journal Frontiers in Ecology and Evolution.

The ants were taken to the station in January 2014 and subsequently studied by astronauts on board.

Ants inside colonies move according to internalised rules, judging how many other ants are nearby by touching antenna and using their sense of smell.

Working together, the ants cover a piece of ground comprehensively to find food and supplies.

When the area expands they change from moving in small circles to scuttling in straighter lines, covering more ground.

But in the micro gravity of space, the ants' rules are confounded and they have to develop a new set of innate principles by which to work.

These flexible principles could be adapted to instruct robots to work together in the same way, for tasks like searching a burning building.

‘We had no idea what the ants would do. We didn't know if they would be able to search at all,’ said Professor Deborah Gordon, a biologist at Stanford University, to the BBC.

The experiment used eight different habitats in total, with each containing 80 common pavement ants.

As barrier doors between the different sections were opened, the ants dispersed to search the new area.

The astronauts then recorded the habitats with an HD video camera.

A control experiment was carried out on Earth, and the results - perhaps unsurprisingly - showed that those on the ground were much better at searching than those in space.

In fact, the ants were not even able to explore the entirety of their habitats in space, as they found it tough to grip and dropped off the surface for up to eight seconds at a time.

At any one moment, the researchers found that seven per cent of the ants were floating around. 

The Ants In Space CSI-06 investigation looked at how an ant colony responds to the extreme environment of microgravity aboard the International Space Station to solve their collective need for resources. Data gathered from this study may help with algorithms for robotics on Earth.

‘The ants did not perform collective search as effectively in microgravity as they did in the ground controls,’ the researchers wrote in their paper.

‘Because ants in microgravity did not use straighter paths or traverse more distance when the area to be searched expanded, they did not search the area thoroughly.’

The researchers noted that one of the reasons the ants struggled to explore their might have been that they were unable to interact with others easily.

However, it was not all bad news; the ants showed an ‘impressive ability to walk on the surface in microgravity, and an even more remarkable capacity to regain their contact with the surface once they were tumbling around in the air.’

The ants also made efforts to remain in contact with the surface.

The ultimate goal, though, was to see how they could overcome problems in their collective search method - such as in a human-dominated environment - something which the ants adapted to fairly well.

These might not be the most famous ants in space you remember: Homer, in the 15th episode of the fifth season of The Simpsons (Deep Space Homer) accidentally crashes in to an ant colony while in space (shown)
