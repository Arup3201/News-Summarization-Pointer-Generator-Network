Alan Evans, 35, is accused of killing wife Louise, 32, after she found out he was having a fling with a teaching assistant Amanda Chadwick (pictured yesterday)

The lover of a husband accused of killing his wife by pushing her down the stairs told a court today that the couple had planned a new life and children of their own.

Alan Evans, 35, is accused of killing wife Louise, 32, after she found out he was having an affair with married teaching assistant Amanda Chadwick, 30, who worked at their children’s school.

Worcester Crown Court heard the welder had attempted to make his wife’s death look like a tragic accident by placing a skipping rope and a vacuum cleaner next to her body.

Today his mistress told the court their affair started when the pair began meeting up to let their children play together or walk dogs.

Explicit details of 1,000 text messages between the pair were read to the jury.

Ms Chadwick said the relationship had eventually become physical and they would 'sneak off' to hotels to have sex.

They also had intercourse in their own marital beds when their partners were away, it was said.

Just one month before Evans allegedly murdered his wife at their home in Kidderminster, Worcestershire, she said the couple had talked of their plans to run away together and have children of their own.

She claimed Evans had made fun of his wife’s problems getting pregnant just weeks before she died.She said she had wanted to end her own marriage, adding 'But I wanted to do it the right way, on our terms, to sit them down and tell them.

'Louise called me, she asked me why I there were over 1,000 text messages between me and her husband.

'I didn’t realise there were that many. She asked me why I was texting her husband at certain times of the night. I said it was because he was working.

'I felt stupid and awful, I knew she wasn’t stupid, I knew in the back of her mind she knew.

'I respected her, even though I was having an affair with her husband.'

The court heard Mrs Evans had been forced to go through expensive IVF treatment in order to conceive the couple’s twin daughters.

And while reassuring his mistress that he would be able to have more children Evans “took the mickey” out of his wife’s problems, it was said.

Ms Chadwick added: 'It was insensitive. If anyone had said it about myself I would be mortified.

'I thought he was taking the mickey out of himself at first - I didn’t think he would ever take the mickey out of her for that.'

A jury of six men and six women also heard that the pair had sent each other scheming text messages to try and put Mrs Evans, who had become suspicious, off the scent.

Prosecutor Jonas Hankin QC said when Louise discovered her husband had sent over 1,000 text messages to Miss Chadwick she confronted him in a furious telephone call at work.

He also read out a series of text messages that Ms Chadwick and Evans had sent to each other to make it seem to Mrs Evans and Ms Chadwick’s husband Simon that it was innocent.

The court heard Evans colluded with his mistress (pictured leaving court) to deceive his wife by sending manufactured text messages to each other days before her death

One, sent by Ms Chadwick, read: 'OMG seriously, she must not know me at all if she did she would know I am trying to save my marriage, not have an affair.’

She told the court: 'They were for Simon and Louise. They weren’t true, I still loved him [Evans].

'We must have talked about making sure that they still didn’t find out.'

Earlier messages between the pair were also read to the court showing their desire to run away together.

One sent by Ms Chadwick read: 'he he, I am funny, thought it would make you giggle... Never going to split up again, together forever, so lucky to still have you, never felt so hurt before in my life... Let’s not waste time, let’s plan for our lives, somebody up there must know we deserve each other.'

Another message from Evans read: 'i just want to show you off to my family. They will love you.'I love you 210 per cent, oh my god I want you so much chick.'

Just one month before Evans allegedly murdered his wife (pictured on images from a Facebook account) at their home in Kidderminster, Worcestershire, she said the couple had talked of their plans to run away together and have children of their own

Louise Evans was described as a loyal friend, a devoted wife and a brilliant mother to her three girls

Mr Hankin then asked her to read out a message she had sent to Evans following that conversation.

She said: 'That fat bitch is going to school to complain to Hilary. Said she is going to do what ever it takes for me to lose my job.'

Despite the affair Ms Chadwick claimed that she had grown close to Mrs Evans as well, the pair spending time going to the cinema together and going to each other’s homes.

Evans denies one count of murder.

The trial - which is expected to last another five weeks - continues.
