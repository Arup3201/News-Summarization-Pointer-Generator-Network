New claims: According to GPS records obtained by TMZ.com, Justin Bieber couldn't have been drag racing at the time of his arrest on 23rd January

Justin Bieber was not drag racing at the time of his arrest, new reports have alleged.

According to TMZ.com, who claim to have obtained the print-out of the GPS records from the Lamborghini Bieber had rented and was driving at the time of his arrest in Miami last week, the records would have shown a higher driving speed if the 19-year-old had been drag racing his friend Khalil, as police initially claimed.

Miami Beach police primarily accused Bieber and Khalil of racing at speeds of between 50 and 60 miles an hour.

However, judging by the TMZ print-out, the maximum speed reached by Bieber in the car was 44mph, which was when he left Club Set in Miami Beach at 4.07am, before the speed dropped to a maximum speed of 27mph just two minutes later.

The website claim that the significance behind the figures is that the 27mph reading came on the 3700 block of Pine Tree Drive - where the speed limit is 30mph - and that if Bieber had been drag racing at that point, the reading would have been significantly higher.

Police had originally claimed they caught sight of the drag race on the 2600 block of the road, before Bieber was pulled over and arrested in the 4100 block.Â 

There are also discrepancies in the GPS 
reading from the Escalade which was reported to have been used to block 
traffic on Pine Tree Drive to allow the drag race to take place.

Off the hook? The GPS show that the maximum speed reached by Bieber in his rented yellow Lamborghini was 44mph

However, the print-out of the GPS show that the vehicle originally stopped outside the club at 2.35am, when Bieber and his dad, who was in the Escalade, headed inside and remained for 1.2 hours.

The vehicle isn't registered to have begun moving again until 4.06am, and didn't stop until Bieber was pulled over - dismissing claims that it was used to facilitate the race.

TMZ claim that if the GPS records are correct, the figures will cause issues for prosecutors in the case, as it will mean that Bieber's car was pulled over for a reason that doesn't actually exist.

Regardless of the GPS records, official toxicology reports from Bieber's arrest show that the singer had marijuana and the 
active ingredient of Xanax in his system when he was arrested on January 23rd.

guilty to DUI after the arrest.

Meanwhile, in the latest alleged criminal episode earlier this week, 
Justin and five of his entourage are accused of assaulting a limousine 
driver on December 30 after they were picked up from a nightclub.

Toronto
 police released a statement saying the limo driver and an unnamed 
passenger had an altercation during which he was hit on the back of the 
head 'several times'.

The
 charge is yet another in a string of recent run-ins with the law, but 
if Bieber is convicted of assault, federal law allows that the Canadian could very well be deported and banned from working
 in the United States.

Meanwhile, former Bee Gees star Barry Gibb is the latest person to offer Bieber some advice in the wake of his difficult few weeks.

Speaking to Matt Lauren on the Today Show, Barry said: 'Things don't really change much, do they? If you're a teenage idol and all the young girls love you, you can lose that pretty quick.

'You can lose perspective, but you can also lose them in the long run if you're not a role model. Hopefully, what he does on stage and the way he dances and the way he sings, he will apply that to his real life.

'There's a discipline in what he's doing. Apply that discipline to how you want to behave.'

Thanks for the support: Bieber took to his Twitter page on Thursday night to thank his fans for their continued support
