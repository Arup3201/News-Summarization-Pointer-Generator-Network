Mercedes motorsport boss Toto Wolff feels Lewis Hamilton has proven he has the mental strength to cope with the pressure of this year's Formula One world title fight following his British Grand Prix win.

In the wake of Hamilton's misjudgement during qualifying at Silverstone, three-times champion Sir Jackie Stewart suggested the 29-year-old's head 'certainly seems to have gone a bit'.

Just 24 hours later Hamilton, starting from sixth on the grid and with Mercedes team-mate Nico Rosberg on pole, responded to his back-to-the-wall situation by claiming a crucial victory.

Fightback: Lewis Hamilton won the British Grand Prix despite starting in sixth after a qualifying error

Home advantage: The British driver was able to feed off the energy of fans at Silverstone

Hamilton was aided by Rosberg's first retirement of the season due to a gearbox failure, but there was no denying his euphoria in his post- race celebrations and with the overall gap now just four points to the German.

Far from Hamilton cracking, Wolff said: 'Different to what the perception is he is mentally very strong and he has coped well with problems.

'On Saturday night he showed a very mature, stable way of tackling things, and then in the briefing on the morning of the race he was very focused, very concentrated in a way that was really impressive.

'Another example is during the race he had a pit stop that wasn't perfect, but the first thing he did was to get on to the radio and say to the guys 'don't worry, let's make the next one better'.

'You can see within the team there is no blame culture, it's about trying to improve together.

'So he would have lifted himself out of his low anyway, but winning at home in front of such a crowd will have given him a big boost.

'When you are at home it does give you that extra boost, seeing the fans cheer.

'Even if you don't hear it in the car, I strongly believe in energy, and there was definitely energy behind Lewis at Silverstone.'

Conversely, Wolff concedes the same could now happen for Rosberg as he heads into his home grand prix at Hockenheim next weekend.

'It could be the opposite in Germany and the energy could be behind Nico because it's home turf for him,' said Wolff.

With six one-twos scored by Hamilton and Rosberg this season, Wolff knows there would be no better place to chalk up number seven than on home soil for Mercedes, with their headquarters in Stuttgart just 80 miles away.

'We've already had a couple of home races,' said Wolff.

'We had Malaysia (home of title sponsor Petronas), then a bit of a home race in Austria (Wolff and non-executive chairman Niki Lauda were born there).

'Then we had our home race at Silverstone, and next is Hockenheim near Stuttgart where the mother company lives.

'That's the real home race, and it will be so important to score a good result, with a one-two what we will be trying to achieve.'
