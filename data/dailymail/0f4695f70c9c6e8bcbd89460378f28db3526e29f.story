A grandmother who is 'trapped in World War Two' after a police car ploughed into her garden plans to sue the Metropolitan Police.

The family of Eileen Lee, 76, said she now crouches on the ground with her hands over her head when she hears a loud noise and repeatedly shouts: 'Run for cover, the bombs are dropping'.

They say she has suffered recurring flashbacks of bomb attacks since the police car hit her fence in Kirkdale, Sydenham, south London.

The police car was about to set off in pursuit of a motorcyclist when it overturned and hit the pensioner's fence

The grandmother-of-two survived a Second World War bomb as a child that destroyed her family's Bromley home.

Her daughter Maxine, 49, says her mother, who was only three and four years old during The Blitz, has been thrown into a 1940s time warp.

She said she was fine before the crash on August 22, last year, but has since been diagnosed with post-traumatic stress and spent Christmas in a psychiatric ward at Bethlem Royal Hospital in Beckenham.

Ms Lee said the trauma has left her mother 'just wanting to die'.

Post-traumatic stress disorder is a disabling anxiety disorder triggered by a traumatic experience that can range from a single incident to chronic stress, such as warfare. 

Stressful or frightening events such as serious road accidents, terrorist attacks, military combat, assaults or natural disasters can cause PTSD.

Symptoms of sufferers can include nightmares or flashbacks to the traumatic event or problems sleeping or concentrating that affect daily life. 

The disorder may develop almost immediately or take weeks, months or years to take hold. 

Patients are commonly treated with supportive therapies, including antipsychotics, antidepressants, anti-anxiety medications, and psychotherapy.

The NHS says that PTSD affects up to 30 per cent of people who experience a traumatic event. 

Ten per cent of women and five per cent of men will be affected at some point in their life.

She said: 'Her mental health has further deteriorated on a massive scale.

'She's terrible. I haven't got a mum any more. I've lost her. Since that night she doesn't go out, she doesn't dress.

'It's very, very sad that our united family has come to this.'

The police car was about to pursue a motorbike on her road but crashed and overturned into her garden.

The pensioner was watching television and had let her Pomeranian dog Coco into the back garden minutes earlier. 

Ms Lee said: 'Any loud bangs, any noise outside, she's just petrified. She still doesn't sleep.'

She said her mother is now extremely depressed, according to her daughter, and has suicidal thoughts.

The family say they have struggled to find a lawyer to represent them as they were denied legal aid, which they blamed on upcoming cutbacks.

But they have now secured a lawyer who will represent the family on a 'no win no fee' basis although they have not yet filed a writ.

Ms Lee said: 'I consider that my mum's plight is a matter of major public concern.'

A Metropolitan Police spokesman said: 'A thorough investigation is taking place and it has not yet concluded so it will be inappropriate for us to discuss it at this time.'
