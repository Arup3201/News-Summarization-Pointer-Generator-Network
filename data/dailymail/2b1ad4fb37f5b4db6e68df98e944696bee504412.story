The 50p tax rate for high earners will be cut in 2013 to 45p and again, finances permitting, to 40p in 2014

The controversial 50p tax rate for people earning more than £150,000 will be scrapped, George Osborne announced today.

The cut will affect just 328,000 people and is expected to cost the government somewhere in the region of £400million.

It means top earners will now pay 45p in tax for each pound they earn over £150,000.

When Labour introduced the tax it was expected to raise £3bn for the Treasury but it has in fact raised just one-third of the forecast figure.

Outlining the Budget for the next 
year, Mr Osborne said the cut would be financed by changes in stamp 
duty, the general anti-avoidance tax rule and a 'tycoon tax'.

Mr Osborne said: 'No Chancellor can justify a tax rate that damages our economy and raises next to nothing. It is as simple as that.

'And thanks to the other new taxes on the rich I've announced today, we'll be getting five times more money each and every year from the wealthiest in our society.

'So the richest pay more. The economy benefits. Britain is competitive again.'

Mr Miliband told Mr Osborne that voters would wonder which planet he and Prime Minister David Cameron are on.

The Labour leader also challenged Cabinet ministers to raise their hands if they would personally benefit from cutting the 50p tax rate.

Quoting back one of the Government's favourite mantras to promote transparency, he urged them: 'Sunlight is the best disinfectant.

'Just nod if you're going to benefit from it, or shake your head if you're not. Come on, we've got plenty of time.'

How much higher rate earners will pay under the 45p rate compared with the 50p rate

He said the Chancellor's 'driving ambitions' for the Budget were 'to deliver a tax cut for people earning over £150,000'.

Mr Miliband added: 'How can the priority for our country be an income tax cut for the richest 1 per cent at a time when the squeezed middle are facing rising petrol prices, higher energy bills and tax credits and child benefit being cut?

'Think of what you could have done with the money.'

Mr Miliband said Mr Osborne's growth plan had failed, adding: 'Unemployment is rising month upon month upon month. You promised us last year the deficit would be gone by the end of the Parliament, but today you admit you're borrowing over £150billion more than you said you would.'

Dominic Swords from Henley Business School said: 'Unwinding that 50p down to 45p will have a bigger cost to total tax than he is expecting. Clearly it's a political decision that he's taken to be seen as the champion of enterprise.

'The net effect of the economics of it is a Robin Hood who is taking from the very wealthy to give to the quite wealthy.'

The changes to stamp duty, which is a new 7per cent rate on homes worth more than £2m, will raise something like £500m alone.

The
government has insisted that it was essential to slash the top rate in 
order to build an enterprising economy, attract foreign investment and 
generate growth.

Ahead 
of today's Budget, insiders said he believes there is a brief ‘window of
opportunity’ to ditch the tax before the election run-in.

George Osborne outlined changes to the 50p tax rate today which had met with some resistance from Lib Dem coalition colleagues such as Simon Hughes who said the issue was not one of his party's priorities

The 50p tax, brought in by Labour, raised just a few hundred million pounds rather than the £2.5billion initially estimated.

According to an ITV News-ComRes poll before today's Budget, 46 per cent of people were against the cutting of the 50p top tax rate while 31 per cent were in favour.

The coalition have in recent days comes to an agreement over slashing to top rate, with the Lib Dems supporting it, as long as it came hand-in-hand with other measures to ensure the rich paid more tax.

Simon Hughes, deputy leader of the Liberal Democrats, told the BBC on Monday that the issue was not one of the his party's priorities.

'We have our priority to make sure people at the top end of the income scale pay more and our priority is not to take tax rates down from the top,' he said.

'Our manifesto promise with which we went to the country was to lift people out of tax at the bottom by closing loopholes at the top.

'We did not say hang on to the 50p tax rate, or have a top tax rate at anything else.'

The Chancellor had faced continued unease from his 
own benches over the cut in the tax rate which they believe is an 
inefficient means of generating revenue.

Jesse Norman said: 'I do think that the possibility of cutting the top 
rate is a concern. I don't think people will understand that this is 
being done in order to raise more money.

'The
idea I don't think is going to get across without an enormous amount of
communication,' he told BBC Radio 4's The World at One yesterday.

Labour described the cut in the 50p rate as a 'wrong priority' that demonstrated 'just how out of touch this Government is'.
