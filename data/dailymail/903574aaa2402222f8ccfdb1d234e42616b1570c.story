A Thanksgiving party at a fraternity and sorority house in which men reportedly dressed up in colonial-era costumes and women wore scantily clad Native American-themed outfits is being branded ‘racist’.

Officials at California Polytechnic State University (Cal Poly) in San Luis Obispo told NBC News that they were investigating an off-campus party allegedly called, ‘Colonial Bros and Nava-Hos.’

The university is looking into suggestions that the party was both racist and sexist, despite the event being held off campus.

Under investigation: The school's fraternity is under investigation for throwing ¿Colonial Bros and Nava-hos¿ party

‘Cal Poly is currently reviewing an off-campus party that occurred on November 16 that may have included culturally insensitive, sexist, and offensive behavior,’ university spokesman Matt Lazier wrote in an email to NBC News. ‘While the gathering was held off campus, the university takes diversity and inclusivity very seriously.’

In a campus-wide email, university President Jeffrey D. Armstrong denounced the party and said university officials ‘will respond to any violations of the Standards for Student Conduct’ following an investigation.

Cal Poly President Jeffrey Armstrong: Events like these have no place in the Cal Poly community and are not reflective of the principles of The Mustang Way ¿ Obviously, this was not a university-sponsored event, he wrote in an email

‘Let us be clear, events like these have no place in the Cal Poly community and are not reflective of the principles of The Mustang Way,’ he wrote. ‘Obviously, this was not a university-sponsored event.’

A frat student spoke to the local paper saying he didn’t think the party ‘was meant to be racist.’

‘It’s unfair,’ he said. ‘We are taught that Thanksgiving is Pilgrims and Indians.’

One faculty member identified Phi Sigma Kappa as one of three Greek organizations that hosted the party, though the names of the participating frats and/or sororities will not be released until the University decides whether or not to discipline them.

Tasteless: A Fraternity at Randolph-Macon is investigating a Mexican-American party that was deemed to be 'socially unacceptable' and 'racist'

Tristin Moone, a citizen of the Diné 
(Navajo) Nation who is a student of Native American Studies at Columbia 
University in New York, told NBC News that she's concerned by the 
psychology of those who would think this type of party is acceptable.

‘I
 think the mentality that went into the creation of this party, the 
mentality that thought this was OK, is ubiquitous in America,’ she said.

‘I’m
 worried about indigenous students in that institution not having an 
ally or advocate who can help mentor them, and guide students for a 
better understanding of Native peoples around the world,’ she said.

 ‘I
 think (parties) like these are very reflective of how the dominant 
narrative is supported and nurtured throughout American schools and 
universities, and how it stifles and hinders and silences the Native 
American narrative,’ she said.

Cal Poly University is not the only educational establishment to suffer Frat house parties in poor taste.

Just good fun? Or is it inappropriate for students to dress up as 'illegal' immigrants. The university says it will bring those responsible to account

The Kappa Alpha fraternity at Randolph-Macon College in Virginia may be punished for holding a USA vs. Mexico theme party last weekend.

Photos show party goers dressed in stereotypical clothing such as sombreros and big mustaches meant to represent Mexicans.

One of the drinking games played at the party involved 'Americans' trying to catch 'illegal immigrants.'

Kappa Alpha member Mark Heideman insisted it was not 'meant to be racist whatsoever.' Either way, the college is now investgating.

'The college finds this type of conduct reprehensible and in direct conflict with our values,' the college said in a statement.

'We are in the process of holding the individuals and groups involved responsible through our judicial process.'
