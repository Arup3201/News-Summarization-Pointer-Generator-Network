A top swimsuit model from Queensland's Gold Coast has been killed in a motor cycle crash in Thailand - and police revealed she had not been wearing a helmet at the time.

Lana O'Connell, 23, was riding pillion behind her boyfriend Ken Trivett when they clipped a roadside food stall in Phuket in the early hours of the morning.

They veered across the road, collided with another motorcycle and were thrown to the ground.

It is believed the blonde model struck her head and was pronounced dead several hours after she and her boyfriend had been taken to hospital.

Thai authorities have told Australian officials they believe alcohol could have been a contributing factor in the crash.

They confirmed that Miss O'Connell had not been wearing a safety helmet. Mr Trivett received treatment for his injuries but later discharged himself.

Miss O'Connell's mother, Mrs Marilyn
O'Connell, turned to Facebook to express her sorrow, saying her 
daughter was 'beautiful, inside and out.'

'She will always be in our memory and in our heartsâ€¦only the good die young.' Mr Trivett's brother, Mr Garnett Trivett, told the Gold Coast Bulletin that while he had not had the privilege of getting to know Lana properly he described her as 'one of a kind - such a gentle-natured person.'

They had been going out together for about four years, said Mr Garnett Trivett.

Glamorous Life swimwear designer Joanne Rahn said Miss O'Connell had a bright modelling career ahead of her.

'She was also so professional and one of the girls who was really earmarked to go far,' she said.

'She
was selected for the Mercedes Benz Fashion Week and was always pushed 
forward for media. I have really fond memories of working with her.'

The couple were on holiday in Phuket when the tragic accident occurred
