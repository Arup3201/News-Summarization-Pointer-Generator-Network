Fears are growing for two 'vulnerable' girls who have been missing for a week after going to meet men they befriended on the internet.

Natalie Kelly and Rosina Lee, both 16, left their homes in Northfleet, Kent, for London and have not been seen since.

Officers from Kent Police believe the girls travelled to the capital last Friday after organising the meet-up with the male online friends.

But they have since disappeared and could be anywhere in the capital, police fear.

A spokesman told MailOnline that they were both considered 'vulnerable' but said they could not release further details about who the men were or where exactly they were headed.

People in the Enfield, Tottenham, Shepherds Bush, Hackney, Hounslow or Elephant and Castle areas are being asked to keep a particular look out for the girls.

Natalie is described as white and slim with blue eyes.

She wears her hair in a ponytail amd was last seen wearing black and white leggings, brown Ugg boots and a blue Barbour-style coat.

Rosina is 5ft 3in and slim with straight red hair and brown eyes.

She has a piercing to the right side of her upper lip and a tattoo on her right wrist by the back of her hand with the words 'Daddies girl.'

When she was last seen, she was wearing a white cardigan, black leggings or blue jeans and white Nike Air trainers.

Kent Police are appealing for anyone with information on the girls' whereabouts to phone them quoting reference 23-0734.
