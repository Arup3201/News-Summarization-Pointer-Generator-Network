Jeremy Clarkson has walked into another row after he claimed people in Liverpool 'earn less, die more quickly and have fewer jobs' than people in the South of England.

The Top Gear host wrote that houses in the city were 'worth the square root of sod all' after visiting for one of his programme's live shows.

The mayor of Liverpool has now hit back, branding the highly-paid BBC presenter an 'oaf and a buffoon'.

Jeremy Clarkson has been criticised by the Mayor of Liverpool, Joe Anderson, over comments about the city

As he travels the country as part of the Top Gear Live tour, Clarkson wrote a piece claiming 'the north of England has never been more different from the south'.

He mocked a restaurant and hotel in Liverpool because staff didn't know what a kipper or Tabasco sauce were and poked fun at people like himself for expecting the North to be like the South.

The 54-year-old said that on previous visits to the city, he heard constant burglar alarms during the night, witnessed a knifeman 'run amok' in a restaurant and found a 'dead' girl in his hotel corridor.

He then wrote: 'People up there earn less, die more quickly, have fewer jobs and live in houses that are worth the square root of sod all.'

He added: 'For those who live in the south the north has become "abroad".'

His views  have angered some locals, with Mayor Joe Anderson today vowing to complain to the BBC about the comments, which were published in Clarkson's Sunday Times column.

In an article about the city, Clarkson joked that houses in the North are worth 'the square root of sod all'

The comments were made after Clarkson visited the city as part of his show's Top Gear Live tour of the UK

Mr Anderson said: 'The things he is saying are trying to stigmatise the city and I think the BBC needs to ask questions, especially when he was in the city on a stay that was presumably being paid for by them.

'I'm not sure many people in Liverpool will lose much sleep if he doesn't visit again.'

After the mayor's comments were reported by the Liverpool Echo, Clarkson defended his comments and hit out at what he called the 'local rag'.

He tweeted: 'People of Liverpool. Read what I actually wrote. Including the bits the f***tards on the local rag left out. Shocking journalism.'

Top Gear has a history of sparking rows. In 2008, the show was rapped by the BBC Trust for showing Clarkson and fellow presenter James May sipping gin and tonic at the wheel during a stunt.

During a press conference in Australia in February 2009, Clarkson branded then-UK Prime Minister Gordon Brown a 'one-eyed Scottish idiot'

In 2011, Richard Hammond was discussing a Mexican sports car and suggested that vehicles reflect the national characteristics of the country they are from.

Clarkson was found to have deliberately employed an offensive word after saying a bridge in Burma had a 'slope on it'

Hammond said: 'Mexican cars are just going to be lazy, feckless, flatulent, leaning against a fence asleep looking at a cactus with a blanket with a hole in the middle on as a coat.'

The Mexican ambassador Eduardo Medina-Mora Icaza made a formal complaint to the BBC and called on the presenters to make a public apology for stirring 'bigoted feelings against the Mexican people'.

Then in March last year, Clarkson said during a two-part Burma special: 'That is a proud moment, but there's a slope on it', as a man walked towards them on their makeshift bridge over the River Kwai in Thailand.

Viewers complained about the use of the word 'slope', which is considered a derogatory term for people of Asian descent.

Ofcom launched an investigation into the Burma TV special and ruled in July that the presenter had 'deliberately employed the offensive word to refer to the Asian person'.

Clarkson also had to apologise after unscreened footage showed him using the n-word during filming

Clarkson also had to apologise when unscreened footage emerged of him mumbling the n-word while reciting the children's nursery rhyme 'eeny, meeny, miny, moe' to choose between two cars.

Last year ended with the motoring show's crew forced to flee Argentina after trouble erupted when it emerged they were using a Porsche with the registration number H982 FKL, which some suggested could refer to the Falklands conflict of 1982.

Protests were organised by Argentinian veterans and stones were thrown at vehicles being used by cast and crew.
