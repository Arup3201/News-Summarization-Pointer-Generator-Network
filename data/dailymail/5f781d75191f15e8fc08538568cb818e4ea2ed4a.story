Hull manager Steve Bruce believes Mario Balotelli may not have been too far wrong with his famous 'Why always me?' statement, claiming the striker has been treated as a "whipping boy" by his critics.

Balotelli has been a divisive figure wherever he has plied his trade, from Manchester to Milan, and that is no different now he is with Liverpool.

He has endured a slow start to his Reds career, scoring just once in 10 appearances following his £16million summer move.

The Italy international was placed firmly in the spotlight after the 3-0 Champions League defeat against Real Madrid, with manager Brendan Rodgers among those unimpressed with his decision to swap shirts with Pepe at half-time.

But with Hull heading Anfield on Saturday, Bruce spoke of his sympathy for Balotelli, who once celebrated a goal in the Manchester derby by unveiling a t-shirt with the slogan 'Why always me?'.

"It's not for me to comment on other people's players but from the outside he seems to be the whipping boy at the moment," said the Tigers boss.

"That's always a bit unfair. There's always a scapegoat and he seems to be the one at the minute that the media are on to, and everyone else too.

"I think it's a bit unfair on the lad.

 "There's always one that people pick on. I suppose the changing of the strip (didn't help) but I thought he did okay in that game.

"There's lots been made of the changing of shirts but we've seen it for years haven't we?

"It's maybe not in our DNA in the English leagues but abroad they all do it and they think it's nothing."
