It is said you should never ask a woman her age - but researcher say that by simply knowing her name, it may actually be possible to work out how old people are.

Researchers plotted hundreds of names and their popularity.

They then created a series of graphs that reveal when each name hit its peak - showing when the person was most likely to have been born.

The red dots indicate the age someone with each name is likely to be, based on data from the Social Security Administration, which records birth names dating back to 1880.

Researchers at website fivethirtyeight.com analysed  data from the Social Security Administration.

They then used the SSA’s baby name database and combined it with the agency's actuarial tables.

These which estimate how many people born in a given year are still alive.

The researchers were then able to create the graphs showing when names were most popular.

Researchers at website fivethirtyeight.com analysed  data from the Social Security Administration, which records birth names dating back to 1880.

They found, for example, that certain names meant a person was likely to be in their 70s.

The median living Mildred in the United States is now 78 years old, they discovered, while Gladys, Betty, Ethel and Opal were all of a similar age.

On the younger names, they found Madison, Sydney, Alexa and Haileywere most likely to be between 9 and 12 years old.

Young names include Liam, most likely to be under 5, Jayden and Aiden for boys, while for females Ava, Isabella and Lily were likely to be toddlers.

The team also plotted the popularity of some names over time, and found names like Joseph have always been popular.

The peak year for boys named Joseph was 1914 when about 39,000 of them were born, the researchers found.

Those 1914 Josephs would be due to celebrate their 100th birthdays at some point this year - although only about 130 of them were still alive as of Jan. 1, according to the most recent records.

Joseph has been one of the most enduring American names; it¿s never gone out of fashion.

The team also found certain names allowed a very specific age to be guessed at.

'By contrast, you can make much stronger inferences about a woman named Brittany.

'That name was very popular from the mid-1980s through the mid-1990s, but it wasn’t all that common before and hasn’t been since.'

Half of living American Brittanys are between the ages of 19 and 25, the team found.

The hardest ages to predict came from ages with a wide spread
