Madeleine McCann's mother has ploughed £1million from book sales back into the search for her missing daughter.

The bestseller, entitled Madeleine by Kate McCann, was published in 2011 on the day of her eighth birthday.

Madeleine, who was three, disappeared from her bed in the family’s apartment in Praia da Luz on the evening of May 3, 2007, while her parents were eating at a nearby tapas restaurant – as they did every night of the holiday.

Fundraiser: Kate McCann and Gerry McCann at the launch of the book entitled Madeleine which has now raised £1million

After tax the book netted £738,487 providing a much-need boost to the fund set up by the McCanns, reported the Mirror.

Madeleine’s Fund hit £1.8million shortly after the three-year-old 
vanished from her family’s holiday.

But by 2011, after four years of searching, it had dwindled to £125,000.

Official papers filed with Companies House show all the money raised from the 384-page book went to the fund.

The fund’s directors said: 'Income from the book has significantly improved the position.

'This will continue as a result of publication in other countries and the release of the paperback.'

The continuing search and costly advertising campaigns means the remaining total now stands at £474,86. 

In the searingly honest book Kate McCann explains she thought it would be 'unwise' to leave her three children with a babysitter on the night they dined at the resort restaurant.

Explaining why they did not make use 
of the babysitting service offered by the Ocean Club, she said the 
couple never even thought about it.

She said: 'I could argue that leaving
 my children alone with someone neither we nor they knew would have been
 unwise, and it's certainly not something we'd do  at home, but we 
didn't even consider it.

'We felt so secure we simply didn't think it was necessary.'

Kevin Halligen, 53, self-styled security consultant accused of swindling the Madeleine McCann fund out of £300,000'

With the infamous tapas restaurant 
'so near', the McCanns and their friends  decided to do their own 
child-checking service, said Mrs McCann, adding: 'It goes without saying
 that we now bitterly regret it.'

However British police later told the
 couple their holiday apartment, being a corner flat on the ground 
floor, next to two roads and with secluded entrances, made it a perfect 
target for criminals.

The fund report revealed it was no 
longer paying private investigators in Portugal after Scotland Yard 
announced a major cold case review.

The McCanns from from Rothley, Leicestershire hope this will lead to Portuguese authorities reopening their inquiries.

Last month a self-styled security consultant 
accused of swindling the Madeleine McCann fund out of £300,000 is to be 
extradited to the United States this week to face fraud charges.

Kevin Halligen, 53, lost his final 
appeal before the High Court in London on Friday and will be flown to 
Washington on Thursday to face allegations of cheating former business 
partners out of £1.2 million.

In 2008, Halligen’s company Oakley 
International signed a contract to help find Maddie, who went missing in
 Portugal a year earlier.

He said he would use his MI6 and CIA 
contacts and high-tech surveillance equipment in the hunt but over six 
months he came up with no new leads.

He was arrested in Oxford in November 
2009 after fleeing Washington DC when the US government began seeking an
 indictment against him for ‘wire fraud and money laundering’.

US Courts have also ordered Halligen to pay about £4 million to other former business partners who claim he fleeced them.

Halligen had been fighting extradition since his arrest.
