The Skoda Fabia has been named Car of the Year in the motor industry 'Oscars'.

The Czech company, part of Germany's Volkswagen Group, took the top prize in the awards organised by What Car? magazine, beating more upmarket rivals, including BMWs, Range Rovers, Mercedes-Benz and Porsches.

The awards ceremony, at the Grosvenor House Hotel, London, also saw the Fabia 1.2 TSI 90 SE, pictured right, named best small car, from a shortlist of 25.

The honour repeats Skoda's feat of 15 years ago when its original Fabia won top prize.

Judges praised the Fabia's turbocharged 1.2-litre petrol engine for combining 'punchy and flexible performance with impressive efficiency credentials'.

It's thrifty — averaging 58.8 mpg and has emissions of just 110g/km, putting it in the road tax bracket B, which costs nothing in the first year and £20 a year thereafter.

The judges said: 'It also beats its main rivals in the small car class — the Ford Fiesta and Volkswagen Polo — for both space and practicality.

'The technology that comes as standard on the Fabia includes a brilliant 6.5in touch-screen and a system that can sync with Android phones to provide satnav.

'It's one of the very few cars on sale that has no major weaknesses and when you factor in how keenly priced it is, you start to wonder how on earth Skoda turns a profit. It might not be the most exciting car in the world, but it is the most sensible.' Prices from £10,600.

What Car? editor Jim Holder said: 'We've evaluated all its rivals and the Fabia is the most rounded small car on sale in the UK today.'

Since VW took over the firm, Skoda has shed its joke reputation to become a serious player in the car market. And it was a double triumph for Skoda's blend of Czech style and German engineering, as its larger Octavia 1.2 TSI 105 SE was named best family car.

High-end 4x4 wars have broken out as arch rivals Rolls-Royce and Bentley - both celebrating record global sales and exports - gear up to launch ostentatious off-roaders.  

More than 4,000 Rolls-Royces were sold last year, and boss Torsten Mueller-Oetvoes told me this week the BMWowned firm would make its final decision on entering the market this year.

It is also set to launch a drophead coupe based on the Wraith.

Then Bentley boss Wolfgang Duerheimer said the company had taken 4,000 pre-orders for its off-roader.

Production will help propel the Crewe factory from last year's record 11,000 cars to more than 20,000 by the end of the decade, keeping German owner Volkswagen happy.

Expect also a smaller 'baby' Bentley coupe and soft-top to take on the likes of Aston Martin and Maserati.

Bentley's Geordie MD Michael Straughan, who this week was hob-nobbing with Germany's Chancellor Merkel and Prime Minister David Cameron, has his work cut out.

Watch out, too, for a much touted leap into the compact SUV market from Jaguar.

Land Rover has announced a trio of limited editions of its classic Defender to mark the end of production in Britain.

In December the last Defender will roll off the production lines at the firm's factory in Solihull.

The Heritage edition, from £27,800, on sale from August, is inspired by the very first Land Rover and is a reinterpretation of the first pre-production Series 1 vehicle, nicknamed Huey, from 1947, taking its name from the registration plate HUE 166.

The Adventure edition, pictured left, comes with expedition roof rack, snorkel and rear access ladder. Six hundred will be produced to go on sale from £43,495 in August.

First out of the blocks in April will be 80 of the exclusive Autobiography range, from £61,845, for those who like to rough it in luxury. It has privacy glass, a full Windsor leather interior with ebony or ivory roof lining, and premium leather seats.

To mark the launch, Land Rover also created the largest sand drawing ever in Britain — of the Defender — measuring 0.62 miles across. It was drawn by a fleet of six Land Rovers on the beach — Red Wharf Bay in Anglesey — where, in 1947, Rover's engineering director Maurice Wilks sketched out the shape of the original 4x4 to his brother Spencer, the firm's MD.

However, Land Rover has reversed its original decision to kill off the much-loved classic Defender model. It will be built abroad, but outside the EU, possibly in India, South Africa or China.
