Ice cream brand Ben & Jerry's has drawn inspiration from one of 2014's most popular food fads, cookie butter, in order to create a new range of flavors which it believes are good enough to entice even the most dedicated baking enthusiast away from their oven.

The new additions to the brand's 'core' range, a selection of ice creams which include a softer sweet center, are each based on a different cookie flavor.

Spectacular Speculoos is described by Ben & Jerry's as 'dark caramel and vanilla ice creams with speculoos cookies and a speculoos cookie butter core'. The flavor is based on the same Belgian spiced shortbread biscuit which features heavily in most cookie butter varieties.  

But how did the ice cream compare to the cookies themselves?

That's nuts! The Daily Mail Online editorial team were on the fence about the peanut butter offering, with some saying the rich peanut taste was too overwhelming

'The Speculoos was the highlight for me – it’s got a slight cinnamon flavor, and I loved the textures of the smooth core, the crunchy cookie and the creamy ice cream together,' said US Femail Editor Tamara Abraham, before adding: 'I’d buy it in a heartbeat.'

Femail reporter Erica Tempesta agreed. 

'I love cookie butter so I love the fact that there is now an ice cream filled with it,' she said. 'I'm so glad that they've included it in the permanent line-up and I will definitely buy it again.'

The Peanut Buttah variety was also commended on its authentic flavor, with many people marveling at the rich taste - and unique texture of the ice cream, which is described on the Ben & Jerry's website as being 'for peanut butter fans and cookie spread-heads who want it all'.

According to Daily Mail Online's Senior Associate Photo Editor Kaitlinn Van Ert, that description hits the nail on the head.

'The peanut butter was my favorite. It felt like I was eating it straight from the jar and the cookie bits were little chunks of heaven that added a nice textural element.'

But the rich peanut flavor didn't sit well with everyone.

Picture Director Jolie Novak found the peanut taste slightly too 'overwhelming' and felt that it would have been better had it been paired with chocolate. 

Chocolate fix: The most popular of the three new flavors was the Boom Chocolatta, which features a delicious chocolate cookie core

'It was a bit too much peanut butter for me and I prefer it cut with the chocolate!' she said. 

'It had nice sized chunks of peanut butter and was a bit more gooey than the other flavors, but paired with the peanut butter ice cream it was all a bit overwhelming.'

Chocolate lovers will no doubt be pleased to hear that the new Ben & Jerry's core line-up also includes a cocoa-rich option too. 

The Boom Chocolatta, which is described by the brand as 'mocha and caramel ice creams with chocolate cookies, fudge flakes and a chocolate cookie core', proved to be the most popular flavor of the three, with US Editor Katherine Thomson describing it as 'heaven'.

'I would buy this again in a heartbeat,' she added. 'My go to has always been Phish Food but this beats it. I love the texture, and I love the harder chocolate bits. 

'It’s delicious and not too chocolatey.'

Contributing Femail Editor Olivia Fleming was in total agreement: 'I liked the chocolate the best – and as someone who would never choose chocolate-flavored ice cream, this is saying something. 

'The brownie in the core melted in my mouth.'
