An emaciated pit bull described by humane society officials in Louisiana as the worst case of abuse they’d ever seen has staged an amazing turnaround in just two weeks.

Vets at Jefferson Parish Animal Shelter feared for the 3-year-old pup, named Athena, when she arrived on Oct. 15.

Then Athena was on the brink of death, too weak to lift her head and weighing just 25lbs - less than half the body weight of a healthy dog her age.

Pit bull Athena has gained 14lbs since she was taken into care and adopted by Joana Castay, right

Heart-rending sight: Athena, a 3-year-old pit bull, came to the Jefferson SPCA weighing only 25lbs, with all her bones clearly visible through her skin

‘I thought she was dead. I couldn't even believe she was breathing,’ shelter director Robin Beaulieu told Nola.com. ‘I'm surely no stranger to cruelty, but I'd never seen a dog in her condition.’

She committed to paying all the medical bills for the animal if a home could be found for the dog who has been named after the Greek goddess of wisdom.

Later that day, the dog was transferred to Metairie Small Animal Hospital, where veterinary assistant Joana Castay saw her and decided to adopt her.

The sweet-faced pit bull has made a startling recovery in the ensuing two weeks and while still too thin, the dog is back on her feet and thriving with the attention she is receiving.

A little over two weeks ago vets didn't think that Athena would make it as she was barely alive - extremely malnourished and dehydrated, infested with hookworms and heartworms

Skin and bones: Athena was so emaciated and riddled with ailments that she could not even lift her head 

The positive changes in Athena is 
attributed to ‘food, love and deworming’ by Castay.

At first, Athena was fed chicken and canned dog food, which she could only manage in small portions.

‘It
was definitely a workout for her to eat,’ Castay told Nola.com. ‘She 
would eat a little, take a break for 30 minutes or an hour, and then eat
some more.’

Athena 
spends her days at the hospital, but every night goes home with Castay 
and has integrated well with other two dogs - Beans and Carley.

‘I
can't believe how easily she has looked to us for safety and love after
her trust in people was broken,’ said Cathay. ‘She just seems so 
grateful.’

Athena
is a little weary of men and still hides when Castay's boyfriend comes 
to visit, although he is more friendly with her cat Voodoo.

Horrific neglect: Athena suffered from anemia and dehydration, an infection in her uterus, as well as heartworms and hook worms

Since being rescued, Athena gained almost a pound a day and by Thursday her weigh was up to 39 pounds, 11 ounces.

‘She eats three times a day, and now she eats all her food in one sitting,’ said Castay.

Athena
still has to overcome a very severe case of heartworms, but needs to 
get stronger and gain another 10 or 15 pounds before the treatment can 
start. It will then take three months to complete, said Castay.

Once she reaches a healthy weight, which is around 60lbs for female pit bulls.

‘To see that in her eyes, how grateful she is, to be loved, that's a special thing,’ said Castay. 

Those who would like to help with Athena's mounting medical costs could donate money on the fundraising site JustGive.com.
