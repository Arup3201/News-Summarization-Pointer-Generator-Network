Loss: Finance student Michael Deng died from head injuries during a hazing

More than 30 members of a New York fraternity are expected to be charged over the death of a 19-year-old student during a hazing in December.

Michael Deng, who was a freshman at Baruch College in New York City, died from serious head injuries after taking part in a ritual at a rented house in Pennsylvania.

His fellow students are accused of waiting for about an hour and a half before taking the unconscious teenager to hospital.

Investigators claimed that before Deng died he was blindfolded and had been trying to carry a heavy backpack while members of the Pi Delta Psi fraternity hit him on December 9, last year.

Instead of rushing him straight to hospital, the fellow students are accused of changing his clothes and searching the internet for information about head injuries.

A coroner ruled that the death was a homicide, and that Deng died from blunt force head trauma.

Police say that several of the students involved in the hazing, which took place in Tunkhannock Township, could face homicide charges. Their names have not been released.

Ponoco Mountain police chief Harry Lewis told the New York Times that under Pennsylvania law homicide covers everything from involuntary manslaughter, which could mean a year in prison, to premeditated murder.

The students are also expected to be charged with hazing, which is a misdemeanor crime.

Chief
 Lewis added that 'every video, photo, content, conversation' had been 
collected from the students, some of whom allegedly tried to hide 
information.

Charges had been due to be brought 
against the students in May, but police are waiting for a digital 
reconstruction of events on the day Deng died.

The family of Deng, who was raised in Queens and had been studying finance, have said they will wait until any court cases have finished before making a decision about a lawsuit.

A spokeswoman for Baruch College said that disciplinary action by the education facility was still underway. Some of the students have been suspended, NY1 reported.

The Pi Delta Psi organization has said it will wait until the court cases are finished before taking steps against members of the Baruch branch, which has since been disbanded.
