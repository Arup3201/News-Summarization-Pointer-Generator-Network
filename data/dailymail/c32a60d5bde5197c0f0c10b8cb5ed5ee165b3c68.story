Frustrated San Francisco drivers who are fed up having to circle around trying find a parking space on the street can use a new app that allows them to purchase a spot from someone who is already parked in one.

The app, called 'Monkey Parking,' connects drivers looking for empty spaces with someone who is also on the app who is willing to give up their prized spot, but for a fee of anywhere between $5 and $20.

San Francisco has a severe parking crunch already, given that the city has about 500,000 parking spots and there are about 750,000 residents. And that doesn't even include the tens of thousands of drivers who come into city daily.

A new app for San Francisco drivers called 'Monkey Parking' lets them buy a parking spot from another motorist already in a space

Although the app is slowly catching on in the city by the bay, San Francisco officials are questioning whether the practice is even legal. Others in the city have complained that the app is unfair as it is lining the pockets of some motorists out to make quick buck at the expense of other drivers.

'You are trying to monetize public parking spaces and it is disgusting,' one person wrote on Monkey Parking's Twitter feed.

However, Monkey Parking CEO and co-founder Paolo Dobrowolny tells the San Francisco Chronicle those reactions are unfair. He claims that the app just acts as a facilitator between those looking for parking and those who need a financial reward to move from their space.

'We’re just providing information when someone is leaving,' he said. 'That is valuable information for everybody.'

He also dismisses claims that that the app discriminates against those who are not able to pay up to $20 for a space.

'It’s a fair business for anybody,' Dobrowolny said. 'It’s not just for rich people. If you think you can get that money back when you leave that parking spot, you can earn back the money when you leave the spot.'

He adds that the app will help to improve the lives of San Franciscans as well.

'If it’s faster to get a parking spot, or if someone was leaving in any case, that is an improvement to urban city living overall,' he told CBS San Francisco. 'We’re not trying to create this strange thing that they’re saying we are.'
