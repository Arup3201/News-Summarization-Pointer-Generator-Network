It started out like any other boating trip until she stepped into the water to launch her boat and her legs were attacked by flesh eating creatures.

Adele Shrimpton has no idea what left her legs covered in bloody marks this week - and the experts don't either.

While standing in just centimetres of water on the Tweed River, an estuary situated in the Northern Rivers district of New South Wales, Ms Shrimpton noticed she was being bitten.

'It was like stinging. I thought it was just sea lice, and wasn't worried about it until I got back to my boat,' she told the Tweed Daily News.

The marks left from the mystery blood sucking creatures are still clear on Ms Shrimpton's legs

Recalling the moment she discovered her legs had been chewed by an unknown species, she said: 'I went "holy crap" - there was all this blood!'

Her legs still bear the red marks and scabs of the unexpected attack but local authorities have  been unable to identify what caused the bites, the local newspaper claims. 

Ms Shrimpton told the paper she is worried about what could happen if the creatures bit the children that swim in the area.

A worker at a local Tweed River fishing shop told Daily Mail Australia: 'I've never come across anything like. That sort of baffles me.

'Unless it was a stringer or something but she didn't describe it like that,' she said.

The Tweed River is based on volcanic soils and locals say it just boasts normal fish 

The local said they just have the normal estuary fish such as Mangrove Jacks, Whiting, Flatheads and Bream in the water.

A local council source explained they had not been contacted by Ms Shrimpton and that they would need to receive a report from her before it could be investigated. 

They said they were unable to 'shed any light' on what happened.  

The Tweed River, which was originally covered by rainforest, has a fine subtropical climate and is based on volcanic soils.

Named after the River Tweed in Britain, it is located at the border of New South Wales and Queensland.

Daily Mail Australia has contacted NSW Fisheries  for comment.
