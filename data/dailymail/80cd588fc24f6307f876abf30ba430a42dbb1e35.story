Jamaica has made it legal to possess small amounts of marijuana in a historical law change which will allow Rastafarians to freely smoke the drug.

Cannabis has been illegal on the Caribbean island for decades despite it being puffed as a sacrament by Rastafarians and sung about in their reggae music.

The law new makes possession of up to two ounces of marijuana a petty offence that could result in a ticket but not in a criminal record.

Cultivation of five or fewer plants on any premises would also be permitted.

Tourists who are prescribed medical marijuana abroad will soon be able to apply for permits authorising them to legally buy small amounts of Jamaican weed, or 'ganja' as it is known locally.

Jamaica has long been considered as the Caribbean's largest supplier of marijuana to the United States and regional islands.

But despite the new legislation, Peter Bunting, the island's national security minister has said it does not mean they have backed down from cracking transnational drug trafficking.

Mr Bunting told parliament: 'The passage of this legislation does not create a free-for-all in the growing, transporting, dealing or exporting of ganja.

'The security forces will continue to rigorously enforce Jamaican law consistent with our international treaty obligations.'

Debate has long raged in Jamaica over relaxing laws prohibiting ganja but previous calls to decriminalize small amounts of marijuana fizzled out because officials feared they would bring sanctions from Washington.

Jamaican officials now have high hopes that the island can become a player in the nascent medical marijuana industry, health tourism and the development of innovative pot-derived items.

Local scientists now hope to capitalise on the law change as they already have a history of creating marijuana-derived products

Commerce Minister Anthony Hylton said the cannabis industry holds 'great potential' for Jamaica, where marijuana has long been grown illegally on mountainsides and marshes.

The move by Jamaican lawmakers adds to an international trend of easing restrictions on marijuana for medical or personal use.

More than 20 U.S. states allow some form of medical marijuana and last year Colorado and Washington legalised personal use.

Yesterday Alaska became the third U.S. state to legalise the recreational use of marijuana for adults.

In the Americas, Uruguay last year became the first nation to create a legal marijuana market.

In Argentina, personal possession of marijuana was decriminalised under a 2009 Supreme Court ruling that jail time for small amounts of drugs violates the country's constitution.

A law in Chile also permits use of medical marijuana.
