Roberto Martinez used Everton's dead-rubber clash with Krasnodar to show off the club's young diamonds and, on this showing, the Toffees may have unearthed a real gem.

Boasting one of Europe's finest left backs in Leighton Baines, Everton appear to have a more than able deputy waiting in the wings.

Luke Garbutt has possibly one of the most difficult jobs in football on his hands in trying to usurp Baines from the Everton first-team but on Thursday night the defender showed he is more than capable of holding his own on the big stage.

Arriving at the club from Leeds United as a 16-year-old in 2009 for a fee of £600,000, Evertonians will have heard Garbutt's name from time to time as 'one for the future' but have rarely had a chance to see him play until now.

With England Under 21s manager Gareth Southgate casting his eye over the Blues' youngsters here at Goodison Park, Garbutt will have certainly caught his attention.

Helping to keep a clean sheet in the Toffees' 2-0 victory over Wolfsburg, Garbutt gave a composed and assured performance way beyond his years last month. Once again, in his second Europa League start, the defender looked a natural.

Dependable and sturdy at the back, it was Garbutt's lung-busting runs forward and pinpoint crossing which really got the Everton faithful excited.

Positionally sound, the Harrogate-born full back was full of running and showed great confidence striding forward and, at one point, appeared to rob the ball off the more experienced Steven Pienaar on the wing as the South African pondered what to do next.

Take-ons completed: 3 

Constantly looking to make things happen, Garbutt's intention every time he received the ball was to march towards the byline and cross for the frontmen.

With pinpoint accuracy, this wasn't a player aimlessly lofting the ball into the area – Garbutt knew exactly where to put it. Curling crosses, pull backs, drilling the ball, the full back mixed it up and his deliveries kept the Krasnodar defence guessing throughout.

The initiative showed will certainly please manager Martinez and Garbutt, who spent a portion of last season on loan at Colchester, has certainly benefited from having a player like Baines to learn from.

It is a big ask to get ahead of the England left back, the player who has assisted so many goals – and scored a few himself, too – for Everton over the past few years but Garbutt certainly has the capabilities to play in the Premier League.

As Martinez's team evolves Garbutt may in fact get his chance with Baines still in the side. The Spaniard has admitted in the past that Everton's current No 3 could follow in the footsteps of Philipp Lahm and move to midfield which would allow Garbutt a chance.

For the first time ever, the Europa League winners will play in the Champions League next term and while Martinez will strive to pick his strongest XI from here on in, this competition may be the platform for Garbutt to shine on as the Toffees continue into the knockout stages on the road to Warsaw.

With the Merseysider's progress ensured before kick-off, the youngster certainly got Everton fans talking and was a high point on a night when an opportunity for the club's academy lads was more important than the result

Supporters, including Cockney Blues Daniel and Dale Drury - showing real commitment travelling all the way up from London to Liverpool for a fixture with nothing riding on it - were excited at the prospect at seeing Everton's academy crop in action.

Despite the 1-0 defeat, Martinez's decision to blood the youngsters paid dividends. Seeing the next generation of Blues performing so confidently in a competitive fixture has given Evertonians reason to be cheerful about the future.

Tyias Browning stuck to his defensive duties well, 17-year-old midfielder Ryan Ledson was confident and tidy in possession while Conor McAleny was constantly looking to make things happen playing behind Kone as well as out wide.

However, Garbutt was the one who stood out. Everton have a real player on their hands and the left back would not look out of place in the first-team.
