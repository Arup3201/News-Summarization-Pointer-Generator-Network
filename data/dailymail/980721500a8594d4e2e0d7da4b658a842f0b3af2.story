Opportunities: Treasury minister Sajid Javid said leaving the EU was not something voters needed to fear

Leaving the European Union is not something to be afraid of, Treasury minister Sajid Javid has claimed.

The Tory MP suggested that if voters choose to sever ties with the EU, Britain could ‘seize opportunities that would create’.

His surprise intervention came as David Cameron revealed curbing migrants’ access to benefits will be a key demand in his forthcoming battle to claw powers back from Brussels.

The Prime Minister has promised to stage an in-out referendum by 2017, after negotiating a ‘fresh settlement’ with the EU including returning some powers to London.

He revealed he is looking closely at the problem of ‘welfare tourism’ including workers in this country claiming child benefit when their families live abroad as part of the rules he wants overhauled.

In an interview at the G20 summit yesterday, Mr Cameron gave his first indication of the flashpoints in his promised renegotiation of the UK’s relationship with Brussels.

The Prime Minister has repeatedly said he wants Britain to remain part of a reformed EU.

But Mr Javid, tipped for promotion in the next government reshuffle, said leaving the EU altogether was not something to fear.

He insisted the best outcome of the 
process to change the UK's relationship with Brussels would be remaining
in a reformed EU more focused on free trade.

But he told The House magazine: ‘We can all be better off inside the European Union if it can change some of its ways.

‘But as I say, if the British people 
decide the decision is they want to leave the European Union, then that 
isn't something that I'd be afraid of, I'd embrace the opportunities 
that would create.’

At the beginning of the year, Mr 
Cameron pledged to repatriate powers from the European Union ahead of an
in-out referendum on membership by the end of 2017, if the 
Conservatives win the next election.

Migrants: Prime Minister David Cameron said he wants the EU to look at the rules on benefits

A backbench bill is being piloted through Parliament by Tory MP James Wharton to legislate for the vote, but stands little chance of becoming law against Labour and Lib Dem opposition.

Mr Cameron told The Times he was looking at restricting the ability of migrants from other EU member states to work in Britain, and the options for limiting their access to working-age benefits.

Uncontrolled immigration from EU countries is worrying ministers ahead of the lifting of transitional controls on people from Bulgaria and Romania coming to Britain at the end of this year.

The Prime Minister said: ‘Could the whole problems of immigration, problems with welfare tourism . . . be part of ... making sure we have a European relationship that works for Britain? Yes of course it can. We should consider all of these things.

‘I think we particularly need to look at the rules on benefits. One of the advantages of British membership of the EU is that British people go and live and work in other countries. But I think there is a problem with people living [here] and not working. I also think that transitional controls have been absolutely vital and we need to look at what more we can do on that front.’

He was asked which issues of Britain’s EU membership he has discussed with allies in Europe, including German chancellor Angela Merkel, who has backed calls for member states to take back powers from the European Commission, and the Netherlands which is also concerned about the free movement of people in the 28-member union.

But the Prime Minister acknowledged there was nothing that the Government could do in the short-term stop Romanian and Bulgarian jobseekers arriving in Britain from January. Estimates for how many will come to Britain are up to 400,000.

Last year, net migration from EU nations to the UK was 82,000. The number of EU citizens claiming jobseeker’s allowance or benefits such as those for single parents, the bereaved, carers and disabled people in February this year was 121,200.

Talks: Mr Cameron is hoping to win the support of German Chancellor Angela Merkel, pictured at the G20 summit in Russia, to reform EU benefits rules

While proposals for EU talks have yet to be tabled they could include tightening rules of residence for benefit claimants and stopping child benefit payments to migrants for offspring living abroad.

Mats Persson, of the Open Europe think-tank, said: ‘This is an issue that ranks highly among the UK public’s concerns about the EU and meshes with what Cameron actually can achieve in Europe.

‘The Germans are sympathetic to giving countries more control over who can access benefits, in order to maintain confidence in EU free movement. Given this shared interest, Cameron is right to target this early in EU talks over a new settlement.’

Earlier this year senior government sources revealed they expected Brussels to sue the British government for ‘discriminating’ against other EU nationals over welfare payments.

Since 2004 Britain has required EU nationals to be formally resident in the UK in order to claim state handouts, such as child tax credits, which the Commission said was a breach of EU rules as the ‘right to reside’ could be discriminatory. 

Ministers have in recent months floated plans to charge EU migrants for using the NHS and restrict their access to legal aid. They are also considering plans to restrict benefit payments to new arrivals from Romania and Bulgaria from January if they do not find work.
