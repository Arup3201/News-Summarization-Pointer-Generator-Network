The first U.S. Navy squadron combining the use of combat helicopters with unmanned drones is 'the future of warfare', officials have said.

The aircraft will be operated by a squadron of 140 sailors - called the 'Magicians' - who will work off coastal combat ships that are smaller and faster than destroyers and aircraft carriers.

The Fire Scout drone - which can be controlled by a pilot up to 110 miles away and can remain in the air for at least eight hours - will be for surveillance and target acquisition.

Unmanned drones can also be loaded with missiles to carry out targeted strikes.

Military use of potentially lethal drones has been a source of much controversy, with anti-war campaigners calling for an outright ban.

A draft report for the UN Human Rights Commission this week called for a moratorium on the use of 'lethal autonomous robotics', until an international conference can develop rules for their use.

Admiral David Buss said at a ceremony to introduce the new Navy squadron in California yesterday: 'We've been using multi-million dollar destroyers to chase Somali pirates.

'This approach is designed for near-shore environment where our current experience shows us we're most likely to encounter threats.'

The new approach combines MH-60 Romeo 
helicopters the Navy currently uses with the MQ-8 Fire Scout, a Northrop
Grumman-built drone that looks and launches like a helicopter.

Where
the helicopters are designed and built for antisubmarine and surface 
warfare, as well as search and rescue, the Fire Scout will be equipped 
and used for surveillance, target acquisition and relaying information 
to its controllers, at least for now.

The
unmanned aircraft is controlled by two 'pilots' on the ground or on a 
ship up to 110 miles away.

It can stay in the air for at least eight 
hours, compared to the helicopter's maximum air time of 3.3 hours.

The Navy has been testing the Fire 
Scout since 2007 and deploying it since 2009, using it for 
counter-narcotics operations and in Afghanistan. In 2012, two of the 
drones crashed in separate incidents, and the Navy briefly grounded its 
Fire Scout fleet. Another was shot down over Libya in 2012.

The strengths of the Fire Scout lie in how long it can monitor situations, Buss told a news conference.

'Helicopters
can't stay airborne as long as the Fire Scout,' he said. 'With the Fire
Scout's endurance of up to eight hours, the helicopter crew can return 
refuel, rearm and re-man while the Fire Scout maintains contact.'

Buss acknowledged that the Navy doesn't have a playbook for how to mix manned and unmanned flying warfare.

'The
ink has not dried on any set of criteria yet,' he said. 'As with any 
new systems and any new technology, we work through the bugs from early 
on.'

Manufacturer Northrop
Grumman is looking forward to seeing how the Navy actually uses the 
Fire Scout and already has an upgraded version in the pipeline, 
according to Jim Zortman, sector vice president of global logistics and 
operational support.

'We 
put it in the hands of these smart, young sailors and they figure out 
ways to operate it that we never thought of,' Mr Zortman said.

'They take some little thing we 
barely noticed and do something amazing with it while something we paid a
lot of attention to, they'll barely notice or use at all.'
