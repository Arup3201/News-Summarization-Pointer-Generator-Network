An 11-year-old schoolboy has been left scarred for life after being bit more than ten times by a six-stone Staffie while he played football with his stepbrother.

Kyle Rowan was having a kick-about in a children's play area in Earby, Lancashire, when the dog  jumped over a ramshackle barbed wire fence from a nearby garden and pinned him to the ground.

The dog, known as Hooch, began mauling the young boy, before viciously biting him on his arms, hands and leg.

After hearing the young boy's screams, the dog's 30-year-old owner Steven Hant managed to pull the animal away from Kyle.

But the 11-year-old was left with multiple wounds, including bites on his nostrils and right ear and a total of ten puncture wounds to his right shoulder and arm, hand and legs.

Kyle was so seriously injured from the attack that he was forced to take four weeks off school. Some of the wounds also became badly infected.

Hant has now been banned from keeping a dog for two years after admitting owning a dog dangerously out of control.

He was given a 12-month community order with 200 hours unpaid work when he appeaed at Pennine Magistrates' Court, Burnley. He was also ordered to pay Kyle £260 compensation.

Today, Kyle's mother Gill Clark, 36, said her son was lucky to be alive but had been left frightened by the attack. 

The young boy was left with a total of ten wounds to his right shoulder and arm, hand and legs after being savaged by the dog 

His injuries, including to his arm (left) and shoulder (right), meant Kyle had to take four weeks off school 

She said: 'I think my son is very lucky to be here. He could have died and that is very frightening. If it was someone smaller than Kyle it could have been so much worse. He is very lucky.

'It's been an emotional time for us. He still has to see the doctor and he may need plastic surgery on his right index finger as it goes all tingly and he can't feel it.

'When it happened he wouldn't go to his grandma's who has a dog and when he sees any dog you can see he is fearful.' 

Ms Clark also criticised Hant for failing to apologise for the incident, saying: 'If that was my dog I would have been over and apologised straight away but we've not had anything at all - I don't think very much of the dog's owner at all.

'He could have prevented this if he had taken precautions and had a secure fence especially living so close to a children's play area. It's about being a responsible dog owner. 

Kyle sustained the wounds after the Staffie pinned him to the floor. Some of the cuts became infected 

The schoolboy had to be rushed to hospital after the attack in September last year

'You don't expect this to happen on a children's play area where there are so many children playing.

'Kyle has still got the scars and has been really down and withdrawn since it happened and he has only been out to play a few times.

Steven Hant, 30, admitted owning a dog dangerously out of control

'He had to have four weeks off school because of the attack.

'He'd only been out half an hour when it happened and the next thing I knew was all the banging at the door and Kyle was covered in blood. He was in that much shock he couldn't speak - his face was covered in blood.' 

Speaking about the attack, Kyle addedd: 'I was just playing at the park playing football with my mates and the dog just jumped the fence.

'I saw it running round the corner at the last minute and it just jumped up and stood on two legs and took me to the ground and started biting me.

'I didn't feel any pain just shock. I couldn't scream I was very frightened. My friends tried kicking it. I was trying to kick it and fight it off and trying to run away but it dragged me down.

'I was wearing a bright yellow Brazil shirt and you couldn't see any of the yellow because it was covered in blood.

'The shirt had to be cut off. It was probably the most frightening thing that has happened to me.'

During the court case, Dominic Howell told how the victim was playing football at tea-time with friends and his 12-year-old stepbrother when the dog escaped from Hant's aunt house where it was kept in the back yard.

He told the court: 'It was a bit of a ramshackle sort of fence.

'The dog either jumped over it, or for whatever reason, got out and mauled the victim. It jumped at him, knocked him to the ground and bit him.'

Mr Howell told the court that, when Hant was interviewed, he accepted responsibility for the dog and for the attack. 

Kyle's mother Gill Clark, 36, said her son was lucky to be alive but criticised Hant for failing to apologise for his dog's actions 

Hant said that, when he had been alerted to the incident, he had gone and restrained the dog, the court was told. 

He admitted the fence was probably inadequate but said the dog had never escaped before.

Defending, Graeme Tindall told the court that the incident had come 'completely out of the blue'.

Hooch, who has since been put down, broke this this fence while in the back garden at Hant's aunt's house

He said: 'I think it's agreed by everybody that this, regrettably, has come completely out of the blue.

'He had had the dog since it was eight weeks old and it was 14-months-old when the incident happened.'

He also told the court that the dog had never shown any aggression towards Hant's 16 nephews and nieces, who are aged between one and 16.

He said: 'He has to concede the efforts he made to secure the garden were inadequate.

'The dog having escaped, he did everything right after that. He pulled the dog off and made efforts to make sure it was secure.

'He himself has telephoned the police. He asked them to take the dog away. His understanding is the dog was destroyed on that day.'

After the case Hant, a van driver, said: 'I do want to apologise but the police say I shouldn't otherwise I could be accused of intimidation.

'It was me who rang the police to get him put down. We heard screaming on the day but we thought it was kids playing, we heard it again and I ran out.

'I jumped on the dog and told the rest of the kids to take him to his mum's and ring an ambulance and then I shouted to my my aunt to ring the police and I wanted him put down. We did it that day.

'We think Hooch has gone for the ball. I've got nieces and nephews one to 16-years-old and we have never had any problems before.

'He was a big dog, and did bark if you came near the house but he was playful too. We gave him bones from the butchers but never gave him them raw so it's not as if they have had raw food.

'We're not belittling what has happened, we felt that everyone was thinking we didn't give a damn which we did. It's a little kid at the end of the day and for that I'm very sorry.'
