The teenager who watched her legs get severed at the knees while she attempted to jump aboard a moving freight train today revealed four months on that she ‘clearly thought’ she was about to die.

Anna Beninati, 18, of Sandy, Utah, was studying music therapy at Colorado State University in Fort Collins, and was trying to board the 18mph train with three male friends in September in Longmont.

The student, who was 17 at the time, told MSNBC on Friday that she has much to be thankful for and ‘life doesn’t end’ now. But she will ‘never be able to forget this horrible mistake that I made’.

‘I remember looking down at my leg 
dragging on the ground, looking at the wheels and how fast they were going,’ 
she told MSNBC. ‘I remember looking down there and thinking… what have I
done?

‘I felt my femur snap,’ she added. ‘I 
remember thinking clearly that I was about to die. I’m going to pay for 
it for the rest of my life. I will never be able to forget this horrible
mistake that I made.’

She remembered thinking for ‘several 
minutes before I even ran for the train’ that something was going to go 
wrong and it was a bad idea. ‘I went for it anyway,’ she told MSNBC. 
‘I’m paying for it’.

Anna said she is extremely grateful 
for the support of her family since the incident, although she was 
‘angry’ and had a ‘hard time’ soon after the incident while she came to 
terms with what happened.

Sports: Anna, who has since been studying online courses at CSU, has even been skiing with Wasatch Adaptive Sports in Utah and is intending to compete with a mono-ski in a tournament in March

The student, who had train hopped 
almost a dozen times before, slipped and fell beneath the steel 
wheels as she tried to board and her legs were crushed under the 118-car
train last autumn.

She remembered being under the train 
for up to six seconds, reported the Longmont Times-Call, thinking to 
herself immediately after: 'A: What do I do now? B: What did I just do 
to myself?’

The four friends had visited Denver on
Labor Day weekend and they had been given a ride by one of the young 
men’s fathers to Longmont on the way back to CSU, reported the Longmont 
Times-Call.

But the father was unaware of the 
group’s plan to jump aboard a train from there to Fort Collins. Anna 
said their idea was quite common and the railway goes through the 
university campus.

Wheelchair: Two employees at Longmont United Hospital - Nicole Crowley and Kathy Poiry - were honoured by Anna along with others at a ceremony on Saturday

The student had just seen one friend 
make it onto the train and another slip but roll away to safety. She 
decided to go for it, despite concerns she ‘might not fare so well’.

One of her friends, Charlie Hamilton, 
25, a former Army medic, pulled her from underneath the train and two 
hospital staff, who were stopped at a rail crossing, ran over to help 
him begin first aid.

The employees at Longmont United 
Hospital - Nicole Crowley and Kathy Poiry - were honoured along with 
others at a ceremony earlier this month, reported the Longmont 
Times-Call.

‘I never would have made it this far 
if it weren't for these guys,’ Anna said she realised when she turned 18
on Christmas Eve last month. She has had 11 surgeries on her legs since
the accident.

online courses at CSU, has even been skiing with Wasatch Adaptive Sports
in Utah and is intending to compete with a mono-ski in a tournament in 
March.

'I learn more from her every day than I'm sure she's learned from me'

Debbie Beninati

She has been playing piano, guitar and
bassoon and has spoken in her younger brother’s elementary school class
about safety issues.

‘To see her come away from this 
tragedy with this incredible attitude,’ her mother Debbie Beninati told 
MSNBC, ‘truthfully, I learn more from her every day than I'm sure she's 
learned from me.’
