 

A stripper's father has been accused of extorting nearly $3million from a businessman who paid to have a threesome with his daughter and her cousin who he said was underage.

Terry Tackett, 52, allegedly demanded money from retired software executive Paul Vagnozzi, 61, from Detroit, Michigan, after learning about the sexual encounters he had with Jessica Tackett, 25.

According to federal prosecutors Jessica met Mr Vagnozzi at a strip club in 2008, where she was working as a topless dancer to help support her family.

The pair then started a relationship where he would pay for sex, court documents have revealed.

Affair: Jessica Tackett, 25, started working at a Detroit strip club to help support her family. She met businessman Paul Vagnozzi in the summer of 2008 and they started a sexual relationship 

Threats: Terry Tackett, 52, demanded money from retired software executive Paul Vagnozzi, after he discovered he had a threesome with his daughter and her cousin. Tackett told Vagnozzi she was underage 

That summer, according to court documents seen by The Detroit News, he paid to have a threesome with Jessica's cousin. 

Her father found out about the illicit encounter in October and threatened Mr  Vagnozzi - saying the girl was underage and that he would tell the police unless he was paid.  

Tackett also said he would get his 'mafia' friends at the Jokers Motorcycle Club to beat him up if the hush money stopped.  

The document filed in the United States District Court in Michigan stated he first handed Tackett $30,000.

Two months later Mr Vagnozzi asked the family to confirm in writing they would not tell the police and asked them to stop demanding cash.

Case: Tackett is free on $10,000 unsecured bond but faces up to five years in federal prison and $250,000 in fines if convicted of conspiracy to obstruct justice

They then sent him a letter demanding more installments of $30,000. According to the documents in one month, Mr Vagnozzi gave Terry Tackett $1.15 million in checks,

The flow of money, which stopped in 2012, funded Tackett's lavish lifestyle, including a home in Romulus, Michigan, six Harley-Davidson motorcycles, muscle cars, Jet Skis and expensive gifts for his stripper girlfriends.

The indictment also mentions that Jessica  and her mother, Kimberly, 53, also filed a phony rape complaint against the businessman as part of the alleged extortion scheme.

West Bloomfield Township police in Michigan told The Detroit News that the phony rape complaint was filed against Vagnozzi.

Tackett is now facing 119 federal charges in relation to the scheme - conspiracy to obstruct justice, tax evasion, money laundering and banking crimes. 

If convicted, he could be jailed for up to 20 years.

Raymond Cassar, Mr Vagnozzi's lawyer, thanked the U.S. Attorney's Office  for bringing the 'group to justice.'

In a statement to the Detroit News, he said: 'My client is a good man who was the victim of a lengthy extortion plot by a group of individuals that conspired to take as much money from him as they possibly could over a lengthy period of time.'

Mr Vagnozzi is not on the indictment because he is considered a victim. He has not been charged in relation to having sex with the cousin who Tackett claims is underaged.
