For many people, the chance to own a Ferrari - the luxury sports car associated with musicians, actors and the super-rich - is nothing more than a pipe-dream.

But now, they have the chance to buy the next best thing as shares in the brand are set to become available. 

Fiat Chrysler Automobiles (FCA), which owns Ferrari, plans to list about 10 per cent of Ferrari's outstanding shares through a public offering and distribute the rest to its shareholders.

Shares of Ferrari will be listed in both the US and another European market. The transaction is expected to be completed by some time next year.

The sale is part of a bigger plan by FCA to raise £38billion to fund an investment plan.

Fiat took control of Chrysler this year and its shareholders recently approved the merger, creating Fiat Chrysler Automobiles, the world's seventh-largest automaker.

Fiat had been Chrysler's parent since shortly after Chrysler's bankruptcy and government bailout in 2009. Over the last five years, Fiat has bought out Chrysler's other owners, completing the transaction in January.

Fiat's mass-market brands include Alfa Romeo, Chrysler, Dodge, Fiat and Jeep. 

Fiat Chrysler chief executive Sergio Marchionne said it was 'proper that we pursue separate paths for FCA and Ferrari' following the completion of the merger of Chrysler and Fiat. 

Chairman of Fiat Chrysler Automobiles John Elkann said: 'The separation of Ferrari will preserve the cherished Italian heritage and unique position of the Ferrari business and allow FCA shareholders to continue to benefit from the substantial value inherent in this business.'

Long time Ferrari chairman Luca di Montezemolo stepped down on September 10 after 23 years

Founded by Enzo Ferrari in 1947, Ferrari makes luxury sports cars that cost from $250,000 to more than $1 million. The automaker caps its annual production at about 6,500 vehicles.

Part of Ferrari's mystique comes from its exclusivity and its success on the racetrack.

Its sports cars have been driven by actors, athletes, musicians and the very rich.

Ferrari has been part of Fiat since 1969, when it first acquired a 50 percent stake in Ferrari.

The Ferrari family continued to run the F1 team until 1988. 

The move comes just over a month after Ferrari's longtime chairman, Luca Cordero di Montezemolo, said he was stepping down after 23 years at the head of the car company after a public spat over strategy with Mr Marchionne. 

Mr Marchionne had been a vocal critic of the on-track performance of Ferrari's Formula One team, particularly its lack of world titles since 2007. He has pledged to get the team back to winning ways. 

Ferrari is one of the most successful teams in Formula One history, but it has had one of its worst seasons in recent memory this year.   

Ferrari's top driver, Fernando Alonso, is in sixth place in the Formula One standings, 150 points behind the leader this season, Lewis Hamilton, who drives for Mercedes and has won nine of this year's races.

The Ferrari spin-off is subject to regulatory approval and final approval of the transaction's structure by the Fiat Chrysler board.

The announcement of the Ferrari spin-off comes as FCA said it returned to profit in the third quarter on a strong rise in sales of its luxury brands, as well as revenue gains in North America and Asia. 

There are no plans to spin-off FCA's other luxury brand Maserati.
