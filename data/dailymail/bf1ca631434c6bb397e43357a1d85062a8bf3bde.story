'Husband and wife': President Hollande's girlfriend Valerie Trierweiler will be treated as his wife during a trip to India to avoid any protocol problems

French president Francois Hollande’s girlfriend Valerie Trierweiler will be treated as his ‘honorary wife’ on a state visit to India to avoid protocol problems in the conservative country.

Hardline religious leaders had demanded that Mr Hollande travel alone to India on the trip later this month because he and his partner are ‘living in sin’.

But the Indian government has now agreed to relax their diplomatic rules and treat the 47-year-old divorcee as his legal wife.

The Asian Age newspaper reported: 'Every honour reserved for the wives of heads of state will be afforded to Ms Trierweiler when she visits.

'She will get the full Indian red carpet treatment.'

The decision to welcome the French First Lady as the president’s wife on February 14 is a major U-turn on the Indian’s treatment of Carla Bruni five years ago.

She was forced to loiter in her Delhi hotel - where she had her own room - while boyfriend and president Nicolas Sarkozy attended a string of official functions.

Bruni was not even allowed to accompany Sarkozy at all when he visited the strict Muslim kingdon of Saudi Arabia, where unmarried couples are not allowed to be alone together.

Ms Trierweiler was left seething last year on a visit to Washington DC when American journalists repeatedly quizzed her about her status at a G8 summit.

She told French newspapers on her return: 'They kept asking if I was actually allowed to be there. What kind of era are we living in.'

Ms Trierweiler has also told the French media that she and Mr Hollande - who have been together for five years - ‘have no current plans to marry’.

She said: 'I’m not so sure it will pose a diplomatic problem - except perhaps on a visit to the Pope.

'Frankly, it’s not a subject that preoccupies me. This marriage issue is first and foremost a private matter for us.'

French constitutional expert Christian Delporte added: 'The fact that Francois Hollande and Ms Trierweiler are not married may not bother the French. Here, public and private life are separate.

'But it is not the same in some other countries, where their relationship may be viewed as sinful.

'If they don’t marry then the same thing could happen to him as to Mr Sarkozy, where whatever his private feelings, he gets married out of his obligation to better perform his duties to France.'

Le Figaro newspaper added: 'There are those close to Mr Hollande who are starting to advise him to do precisely this and do it within a few weeks, just to avoid any possible controversy on his trips overseas.'
