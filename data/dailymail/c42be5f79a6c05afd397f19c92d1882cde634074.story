From huge herds of zebras to colossal colonies of penguins, safety it seems, really does comes in numbers.

And these creatures have no qualms when it comes to the issue of personal space with often millions travelling together across difficult terrain.

Such mass migrations create some of the world's greatest wildlife spectacles revealing the stunning patterns and behaviours of the natural world.

This breath-taking set of photographs show that some animals take no chances when it comes to safety in numbers. Pictured is a mass colony of king penguins seen in South Georgia

Often creatures huddle together as a way of keeping themselves safe from predators while they trek thousands of miles in their pursuit for food and shelter.

Amazingly, this type of behaviour isn't specific to a few types of animals and can be seen across the entire wildlife spectrum, including birds, mammals, fish, reptiles, amphibians, insects and crustaceans.

But the reason for these epic congregations can vary, with some animals following weather patterns to sustain their supply of food and water while others migrate to return to familiar breeding grounds. 

A spectacular mass migration sight is that of flamingos in East Africa flying in massive V formations when heading for their preferred breeding area in Tanzania. 

Huge quantities of female red crabs are pictured after spawning on Christmas Island. Larger males arrive at the sea about 5-7 days before they female, but are soon outnumbered

Blue and yellow snapper fish are seen in moving vast schools along the reef, Fiji. These creatures have no qualms when it comes to the issue of personal space

One of the most impressive mass migrations is that of the zebra. Earlier this year, a population of zebras surprised scientists by making a more than 300 mile (482km) journey across Namibia and Botswana

Often seen during mass migration, these enormous animal groupings can be found in countries all over the world and prove an effective method of keeping themselves safe from predators. Pictured is a huge group of great Indian horseshoe bats nesting in India

 The longest insect migration is the monarch butterfly. It travels up to 4,750km.

The rarest migrant is the Amsterdam albatross. There are only 70-80 adults in the world.

The longest recorded journey in water is a leatherback turtle, which travelled 20,558km in 647 days.

As many as 2.5 million pink-feathered birds take to the skies for the journey as their breeding season arrives. 

Humpback whales, for instance, travel further than any other mammal migrants, making a journey of up to 5,300 miles (8,500km) each way.

They are found in all of the world's oceans, with most populations following a regular migration route from polar waters for feeding and tropical waters for mating.

The most dramatic migrations are often seen in the Serengeti, an area located in north Tanzania and extending to south-western Kenya.

Around 750,000 zebras and 1.2 million wildebeests travel from the Ngorongoro area in southern Tanzania to the Masai Mara in lower Kenya following weather patterns.

Thousands of Monarch butterflies rest on a tree in North America. Scientists believe these insects have an internal magnetic compass to help them navigate the world

A huge herd of of hippopotamus crowd into a pool at the end of the dry season in Luangwa National Park, Zambia, Africa. Often groups of over 60 can be seen in one spot

But one of the most impressive mass migrations is that of the zebra. Earlier this year, a population of zebras surprised scientists by making a more than 300 mile (482km) journey across Namibia and Botswana.

This is the longest big-mammal migration ever documented in Africa and is a rare bright spot at a time when mass movements of wildlife are disappearing because of fencing, land occupation and other human pressures.

'It goes to show us that nature still has some surprises,' said Robin Naidoo, senior conservation scientist at the Washington-based World Wildlife Fund that led the two-year study on the migration.

A huge group of grey reef sharks, congregating in Lagoon Pass in Pacific Ocean. Many grey reef sharks have a home range on a specific area of the reef, to which they continually return

 A huge herd of African Cape buffalo kicking up dust in Botswana. The core of the herds is made up of related females, and their offspring. The basic herds are surrounded by subherds of subordinate males, high-ranking males and females and old or invalid animals

Tightly packed knots seen in Snettisham, Norfolk, UK. They have one of the longest migrations of any animal travelling from their Arctic breeding grounds to the coasts of Europe, Africa and Australia

An enormous group of long beaked common dolphin hunt fish off the coast of south Africa. Some dolphins will migrate due to seasonal changes, but they usually don’t travel as far as other whale species
