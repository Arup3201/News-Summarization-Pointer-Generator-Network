Alan Pardew refused to speak to press following the win at St James’ Park, fuelling the Newcastle United manager’s link with the vacant Crystal Palace job.

Pardew would not speak to television, radio or print journalists after Newcastle’s 3-2 win over Everton, with the North East club saying the 53-year-old was simply ‘unavailable’.

Pardew remains the bookmakers’ favourite to become Neil Warnock’s successor at Selhurst Park, and assistant manager John Carver led the press conference in his absence.

The Londoner is familiar with Palace, having spent four years of his playing career at Selhurst Park. 

He played the most games there of any club in his professional career, most notably scoring the winning goal against Liverpool in the FA Cup semi-final in 1990. 

He also played in both the final and the final's replay, as the south Londoners narrowly missed out to Manchester United.

Asked why he was filling in for Pardew, Carver said: ‘He just said: “Will you go do the press for me?” That was it.

‘He’s fine. Delighted. It’s a fantastic result for us. We’ve had a difficult period against good opposition, and it was another good opposition today. He’s been pleased with the performance. It’s probably been one of our best performances in recent times.’

Warnock became the first sacking of the Barclays Premier League season after defeat against Southampton on Boxing Day left Palace in the relegation zone.

Pardew came in from 20/1 to 4/7 favourite recently to take the job, with Tony Pulis another in the frame.
