New York's billionaire mayor Michael Bloomberg has splashed out on a bespoke hand-made copper bath at a cost of around $13,300.

Built to fit the mayor's exact specifications, French craftsmen have hand-molded the vast tub - the latest addition for his five-storey Manhattan townhouse which he is in the process of renovating.

The finished piece is expected to be shipped from the town of Villedieu-les-Poeles, in Normandy, northern France, this month.

According to news service, AFP, it took skilled workmen 250 hours to build the lavish bath tub, by molding two 2mm-thick big sheets of copper.

Etienne Dulin, the owner of the 200-year-old Atelier du Cuivre (Copper Workshop), which was commissioned for the work, told AFP: 'He requested a nickel finish, to give a slightly glossier effect.'

He said that the advantages of a copper bath are that it takes the temperature of the water almost immediately, meaning the water cools down slower, and he said copper also kills bacteria.

Based on the man-hours required to build it, the news service estimated the cost of the bath at at least 10,000 euros ($13,300). Free-standing roll-top baths can be bought from around $500 or less.

Mr Dulin said: 'These days, those who have money are looking for ways to distinguish themselves from the crowd and we are virtually alone in the world in being able to deliver this kind of quality.'

Mr Bloomberg, who completes his 12-year stint as mayor of NYC in November, has recently come under fire from critics angry that the public-transport advocate uses two SUVs to get to work.

The founder of Bloomberg LP, a financial data and media company, has previously boasted that he takes the subway almost every day.

But in fact a New York Times investigation found the vehicles are waiting outside his house virtually every morning.

The Chevrolet Suburbans drive him past two local subway stations and drop him 22 blocks away at an express train station that goes direct to City Hall, according to the news service.
