Durham Cathedral is surrounded by a vivid patchwork of red and brown leaves, a groundsman cuts away the old turf at Lords Cricket Ground ready to be replaced, and deer huddle together as autumn nears its peak.

And as we prepare to move the clocks back for winter, cold weather will sweep in across Britain, with Arctic winds set to 
freeze most of the country by the weekend.

Gritters
 are being readied to cope with a widespread cold-snap, with most of the
 UK expected to have frosts and Scotland and northern England told to 
prepare for snow.

The cold nights are set to get even longer when the country turns back the clock by an hour on Sunday.

The change will mean darker evenings, which will remain until the clocks are put forward again at the end of March next year.

Over the coming days forecasters predict daytime highs of just 4C in the north and 8C in the south, falling to -2C in places at night.

That
 will be good news for children, at least, as half-term tobogganing 
could be on the cards with snow expected in the Scottish Valleys and 
parts of northern England.

Forecasters say showers in the north of England and Scotland on 
Friday will fall as snow and sleet while Saturday will be bright and 
cold across much of the UK.

Cloud will then build bringing outbreaks of rain and more snow, especially north of the border.

'For most of us, it will be the end 
of the week before the sunshine returns and when it does the weather 
will be far from warm,' a spokesman for the Met Office said.

By Friday, much colderÂ air from the Arctic will spread across the UK,
 bringing drier and clearer weather, but much lower temperatures.

'In 
fact, daytime highs will struggle to reach double figures by the weekend
 and there may even be a few wintry showers across north-eastern parts 
of the UK.

'It will be cold and frosty overnight too and for many of us 
this will be the first cold snap of the season.'

Friday will be a bright, clear but 
breezy day, the Met Office predicts, while wintry showers will affect 
coastal counties in the north and east.

It will mainly be dry with sunshine elsewhere 'feeling noticeably cold.' Wintry
 showers are forecast for the east on Saturday, with some expected to be
 heavy.

Sunday will be a little less cold, but mainly cloudy for much of
 the country with some rain forecast.

Clearer, colder conditions will extend south across most areas this evening, according to the Met Office.

Frost is expected to be widespread in
 the north, with increasingly wintry showers in north eastern areas of 
Scotland, and maybe even in the the far north east of England.

Southern England will remain mild and cloudy.
