With its blend of old and modern architecture, Castle Keep really is a tale of two centuries.

It started out at the end of the 18th Century as a folly designed by architect James Wyatt, but was given a new lease of life 30 years ago by Italian artist and property developer Michele Bacciottini, who built its large extension. 

The result is a unique property that is part castle, part modern eco-home. Along with its tower and ‘living wall’, it also has a roof garden and a secret door leading to a spiral staircase.

Graham Porter, 44, who lives in the unique home with his girlfriend Rebecca, 43, bought it for £990,000 in May 2012 after only one viewing.

‘It was certainly different from all the houses we’d seen at the time,’ says Graham, who owns an IT business. ‘Who’d have thought we’d end up living in a castle, especially as we weren’t particularly looking for one, although I have always been fascinated by them.’

When the folly was built, it was in the grounds of the mansion that would later become the prestigious Wycombe Abbey girls’ school, in High Wycombe, Buckinghamshire.

When Graham first saw the property, it required some renovation, but he could see the potential. ‘I knew immediately that I wanted it and we moved in after a couple of months – a lot quicker than we expected,’ he says.

The spiral staircase is like something you’d expect to find in a Harry Potter movie. As we walk through the kitchen, Graham opens a secret door – the front of which is a spice rack – revealing the staircase, which is within the turret section of the house. The staircase automatically lights up as you enter.

At the top of the staircase is a terrace with views of surrounding woodland and, as the decking includes several glass panels, you feel as if you’re walking on air when you look down. Graham and Rebecca use the terrace for dining but also have planting boxes there. 

‘We grow various herbs in each box and the one we normally grow chives in became a nesting area for a mallard, which produced ten beautiful ducklings,’ says Graham. 

The spiral staircase has access to all three floors of the house but the property also has another, solid oak staircase, stretching from ground floor to roof level.

The house, which has four bedrooms and three bathrooms and is on the market for £1.25 million, is heavily insulated and has solar panels. There are also triple-glazed windows throughout the main property, with double glazing in the top turret windows and in the building’s conservatory.

The large bespoke kitchen is modern with solid oak worktops, attractive stone floor and picture windows that overlook a pond surrounded by exotic foliage, including palms, ferns and bamboo. 

There is a meandering pebble water feature and duck house to add to the tranquil setting. ‘The pond attracts lots of species of birds and wildfowl and is a constant source of enjoyment to Rebecca and me as we love nature and wildlife,’ says Graham.

Kitchen fittings that form part of the sale include a large American-style fridge, gas/electric range cooker, washing machine and dishwasher. ‘We love entertaining and the kitchen is perfect for dinner parties,’ says Graham.

Another feature of Castle Keep is its 'living wall' which extends from the ground to the roof terrace (pictured)

The main living room is light and airy, with a wood-burning stove. It backs on to the conservatory/dining room which has underfloor heating and overlooks the garden, which encircles the property. 

On one side of the garden is a large summerhouse that would make an ideal studio, office or gym in a relaxing and picturesque setting.

Another attractive feature of Castle Keep is its vertical ‘living wall’, which extends from the ground to the roof terrace. 

Various species of bird nest in its abundance of flora and an irrigation system waters the plants. Close to Castle Keep is a park, which has a leisure centre and open-air pool, local cricket and tennis clubs, and woodland and river walks.

‘High Wycombe has a great range of shops and there are excellent schools in the area,’ says Graham. ‘Travel to London is also easy.’

The couple are hoping to move to East Sussex as they would like to have more land. 

‘We’d also like a bigger pond, so we can enjoy our love of wildlife. However, we’ll be sad to leave the area and our lovely castle,’ says Graham.
