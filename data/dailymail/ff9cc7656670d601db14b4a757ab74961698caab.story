Julian Assange begged Benedict Cumberbatch not to accept the lead role in the new WikiLeaks film, the actor has revealed.

The Australian activist wrote a 10-page email to Cumberbatch the day before the star began filming The Fifth Estate, in which he stars as Assange, in January.

'It was a very considered, thorough, charming and intelligent account of why he thought this was morally wrong for me to be part of something he thought was going to be damaging in real terms – not just to perceptions but to the reality of the outcome for himself, the actor said.

Benedict Cumberbatch as Julian Assange in the new film about the WikiLeaks founder, The Fifth Estate. The actor says Assange tried to persuade him to reject the role

'He characterised himself as a political refugee, and with [Chelsea, formerly Bradley] Manning awaiting trial, and other supporters of WikiLeaks who have been detained or might be awaiting detention, and the organisation itself – all of that being under threat if I took part in this film', he told the Guardian.

Assange has been outspoken in his opposition to the film, which he has described as a 'massive propaganda attack' on him and his organisation.

The movie is based on two books, by the German technology activist Daniel Domscheit-Berg and by Luke Harding and David Leigh of the Guardian, former collaborators with whom the Australian has now fallen out.

But Cumberbatch, who said he made repeated unsuccessful requests to meet Assange before beginning filming, has defended the project, saying the film 'shows his ideas and integrity and self-sacrifice'.

The actor admitted he thought twice when he received the email because 'I'm a human being'. He wrestled with his reply for four hours before telling Assange the movie would portray his deeds as being nothing but positive and that he would give as 'much complexity and understanding' of Assange in the role as he could.

He did admit to partly taking on the role because 'I'm a vain actor'  - but insisted he was not 'acting in a moral vacuum'.

Asked about Manning – who was sentenced last month to 35 years in prison for leaking documents to WikiLeaks, after which she announced she wished to live as a woman – Cumberbatch said he was not convinced that the army private should be granted the presidential pardon for which she has now appealed, on grounds she took and broke an oath.

While alarmed by the revelations of state surveillance disclosed by the whistleblower Edward Snowden, the actor admitted he was also ambivalent about disclosing secrets.

'If they are saving lives, how can we say that's less important than civil liberties? You don't have any civil liberties if you're dead.'
