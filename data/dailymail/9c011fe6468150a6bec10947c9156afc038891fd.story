So near, yet so far away. The chance of a first Classic success for Roger Varian is so close he can probably smell it.

But between this morning's penultimate declaration stage and Saturday's £650,000 Ladbrokes St Leger lies potentially nerve-shredding tension for the 35-year-old in his fourth season training in Newmarket.

In his Derby runner-up Kingston Hill, Varian appears to be holding a hand stacked with aces as he chases the fifth and by far the most important Group One of his blossoming career.

Kingston Hill is the class act of the line-up in the season's final Classic and 5-2 favourite.

Brave:  Roger Varian says the incident reinforced his philosophy that you should live every day like it's your last

But a weather forecast threatening to dry the ground on Doncaster's Town Moor racecourse, venue of the colt's Group One Racing Post Trophy success last October, could throw a spanner in the works for a horse which has missed its last two intended runs when conditions turned against him.

It's a scenario that causes no-go zones to be declared around tense, irritable trainers whose patience becomes rationed. But not Varian.

He was a born realist and recognises no amount of hollering can turn a tide flowing in the wrong direction.

It also helped that that he learned from one of the sport's most level-headed and respected mentors during 10 seasons assisting the late Michael Jarvis whose Kremlin House stables he now occupies.

But, more than almost any of us, Varian knows the place in the world of a horse race, even one of the most important ones in the racing calendar.

Strength: Varian admits the 48 hours after the incident were difficult but now says he stops being scared

That was a lesson shatteringly learned when he lost elder brother Chris to a brutal murder at the hands of immigrant worker and paranoid schizophrenic whose long history of mental health problems raised uncomfortable questions of why he was not only walking the streets but had even been allowed into the country.

Varian said: 'Something changes in you when you have to deal with something like that in your life. You stop being scared of stuff.

'If I ever start worrying about something I always turn my mind back to Chris and say 'what are you worrying about that for? It doesn't matter.'

'All this stuff is trivial. We are training animals to run as fast as they can. As long as I am doing my best, am honest with people and can go to bed at night with a clear conscience, it doesn't really matter.

'Someone asked me recently if having kids put a new perspective on life but my perspective came from losing my brother and the way we lost him.

Contender: Kingston Hill is the 5-2 favourite for the St Leger and Varian has high hopes the horse can deliver

'What happened, unfortunately you read about more in the news than you used to. It is a frighteningly regular occurrence that some families are torn apart through murder.

'I can vividly remember every second of those 48 hours. You just couldn't believe it and I still can't.

'The funny thing is that as soon as it happened, he was the only one at peace. It is the people left behind that are left with the pain. You have to find a way to live with it and deal with it.

'One of my ways was to try to achieve what Chris did not get a chance to achieve – to live what he didn't get a chance to live for.

'We were very close - 18 months apart. I think I will write about it one day because I want the story told, for people to know what happened, how mad it was and what our family went through.

'I am not looking for pity but I also want what Chris went through to be told when I feel I can do it.'

A philosophy of living life every day as if it is your last, Varian acknowledges, is an easier to adopt than enact but a win for Kingston Hill would doubtless reignite the joyous celebrations which followed the Racing Post Trophy win with Kingston Hill's owner Paul Smith and his family.

Lead: Varian insists Kingston Hill is improving on every run and has a great chance of St. Leger success

Varian, whose valuable success with Battersea at Ascot on Saturday ensured he passed his previous best season's prizemoney tally, admits things have not yet gone to plan this season with Kingston Hill.

The colt, which ended its two-year-old career unbeaten in three runs, has yet to win this summer but has run with massive credit each time.

Varian is talking ambitious targets before the end of the season for a colt which finished eighth in a vintage 2,000 Guineas and fourth to Mukhadram in the Eclipse at Sandown in July.

In between, the way jockey Andrea Atzeni had to burn up fuel to find a good slot from a poor draw in the Derby at Epsom before his length and a quarter second to Australia suggests there is an excellent chance his stamina will last out the extended mile and three-quarters of the St Leger trip.

Varian, married to Hanako with two children, Momoka and Eiji, added: 'He has run three great races in three of the most competitive races of the year.

'He hasn't won yet which we are disappointed about but we not disappointed with him.

'I think he is a seriously good horse who does not need soft ground to show that.

'Forget the 2,000 Guineas, he is not a miler. In hindsight, he produced a very creditable run. His Eclipse run was also very good run.

'If you look at the Derby, he got very close to Australia who is turning out to be a very good horse.

' I don't think he will have a problem staying the St Leger trip. Andrea is certain the trip it won't.

'I think the Arc could be on the agenda providing he comes out of this weekend OK or even the Champion Stakes.'

Recognised Arc trial the Prix Niel at Longchamp on Sunday is the back-up plan should Kingston Hill have to miss Doncaster but there is a determination to be at the start line.

'The two times I have pulled him out – at the Curragh (before the Irish Derby) and at York (before the Great Voltigeur Stakes) it was very quick - Good to Firm officially but there was no good in it.

'I couldn't take a risk because I think there is a lot to come from this guy.'

That patience could be repaid on Saturday.
