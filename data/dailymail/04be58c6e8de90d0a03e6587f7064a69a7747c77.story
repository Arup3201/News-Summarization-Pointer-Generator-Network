The District Attorney who refused to prosecute JonBenet Ramsey's parents did so because he was 'too scared' to put them on trial, it was claimed today.

Alex Hunter did not indict John and Patsy Ramsey because he was 'in over his head', said Donald Davis, who co-authored one of the most authoritative books about what happened.

Speaking exclusively to MailOnline, Mr Davis said that Mr Hunter was 'embarrassed' at the prospect of losing one of the most high profile cases in recent memory - so decided not to go forward with it instead.

Cold case: John and Patsy Ramsey, the parents of murdered beauty queen JonBenet Ramsey, were indicted by a grand jury over her death, but prosecutors refused to press charges, it has been revealed

Unsolved: Six-year-old JonBenet was found bludgeoned and strangled to death in the basement of her home in Boulder, Colorado, on Christmas Day in 1996

Mr Davis co-wrote ‘JonBenet: Inside the Ramsey Murder Investigation’ with Steve Thomas, one of the detectives in Boulder, Colorado who investigated JonBenet's death.

He was speaking out after it emerged that back in 1999 a Colorado grand jury voted to indict the Ramseys on charges of child abuse resulting in death, a felony that can carry up to 48 years in prison.

JonBenet, six, was found bludgeoned and strangled to death in the basement of her home in Boulder on Boxing Day in 1996.

Sources, including members of the grand jury, told the Boulder Daily Camera that Mr Hunter refused to sign the indictment vote and never publicly revealed its decision.

As a result Mr and Mrs Ramsey remained suspects until finally being exonerated in 2008. No-one has ever been convicted.

Mr Davis’s comments threaten to re-open wounds that have barely begun to heal despite the passage of 14 years.

He has never spoken publically about Mr Hunter but said that ‘this would be about the way I would expect it to finally come down’.

He told MailOnline: ‘Mr Hunter was scared. He was in over his head. 

‘He didn’t want to take these people into the courtroom. He was embarrassed they might be set free.'

Mr Davis said that Mr Hunter was ‘known as Mr Plea Bargain around here (Boulder).’

He said: ‘He wasn’t ready for anything beyond that’.

Mr Davis’s book with former cop Steve Thomas was arguably the most sensational about the entire case.

Mr Thomas quit the investigation in 1998 and wrote a scathing letter about Mr Hunter which he made public and explained in depth in the book.

His resignation letter reads: ‘It is difficult to imagine a more compelling situation for the appointment of an entirely independent prosecution team to be introduced into this matter, who would oversee an attempt at righting this case’.

Mr Davis said that Mr Thomas is now ‘living quietly with his wife and a little girl’.

He said: ‘He doesn’t want anything to do with this. He feels that a huge injustice was done. I agree with him’.

'Last picture': JonBenet with her mother, apparently on the morning of her death. Her parents remained suspects in the murder until finally being exonerated in 2008

Horrific: JonBenet was found with her wrists tied above her head and duct tape over her mouth

In a sign of how strong feelings are on the other side, a lawyer for Mr Ramsey, whose wife died of ovarian cancer in 2006, said that Mr Hunter and his staff were actually courageous for what they did.

Attorney Bryan Morgan said: 'If what you report actually happened, then there were some very professional and brave people in Alex’s office.'

Hunter, who left office in 2001 after 28 years as Boulder County's district attorney, has declined to discuss the grand jury's actions.

In 1999 when he announced the end of investigation, he said: 'I and my prosecution task force believe we do not have sufficient evidence to warrant a filing of charges against anyone who has been investigated at this time.'

It is unclear whether Mr Hunter was required to sign the indictment.

However, one expert told the Daily Camera that in her opinion proper legal procedure would have been to sign the document and file it with the court before going to open court to dismiss the charges.

Defending accusations: Patsy and John Ramsey hold a picture of their daughter during a press conference in 2000 where they released the results of an independent lie detector test, which revealed they had no knowledge of who killed their daughter

In a statement Mr Hunter told the Daily Camera: 'Colorado statutes, the ethical canons which govern the practice of law, and the Boulder District Court's oaths, instructions and orders in the JonBenet Ramsey grand jury proceedings, are well established and absolutely clear with respect to the various participants' legal obligations, duties and responsibilities, including the inviolate secrecy of the proceedings and the differing burdens of proof applicable to jurors and prosecutors.

'As the duly elected district attorney at the time and as an officer of the court then and now, I must respectfully decline further comment.'

It was on Christmas Day of 1996 that the Ramseys received a ransom note saying that JonBenet had been kidnapped and that the kidnappers were demanding $118,000 - the amount of a bonus Mr Ramsey had recently received - or else she would be beheaded.

It was not long before her body was found in the basement of the house.

Her wrists were tied above her head, and she had duct tape over her mouth.

An autopsy report revealed that she had been strangled and bludgeoned to death.

Within hours, the Ramseys themselves became the chief suspects of the investigation and police were later criticised for losing focus of the crime scene and other leads by concentrating on the family - including JonBenet's brother Burke - instead of following up other leads.

For the next 12 years, the blame for their daughter's death - who was given the name Little Miss Sunshine - lay largely on their shoulders as they fought to clear their name and find the real killer.

Eventually, Mr Hunter’s office completely cleared the Ramseys of any wrongdoing in their daughter’s slaying and issued an apology in 2008.

Since then, Mr Ramsey has kept the memory of his daughter alive, despite losing his reputation, a thriving business and his wife.

He eventually found happiness through his relationship with fashion designer Jan Rousseaux, who he married at a private ceremony in Charlevoix, Michigan, in July 2011.

Last year, a former detective officially broke his silence over the investigation, saying that overlooked clues like cobwebs and a child's toy could prove important in finding the killer in the high-profile cold case.

In his self-published book, Foreign Faction: Who Really Kidnapped JonBenet Ramsey?, Jim Kolar revealed thousands of pages worth of investigations and police reports.

He said he wanted the truth to be out in the public domain, and has a theory that a children’s toy could be responsible for the marks on JonBenet’s back.

Mr Ramsey told police in 1996 that an intruder broke through a window in the basement.

But in macabre police video that shows the basement hours after JonBenet was found dead, Koler pointed out that there are wispy cobwebs, moving ever so slightly.

Koler speculates that an intruder would have brushed away the cobwebs upon entering the Ramsey’s residence and thus JonBenet’s killer would have already been inside the house.

Among those whose lives have never been the same after the JonBenet Ramsey case is retired Boulder chief of police, Tom Koby.

He told MailOnline that he would still ‘like to justice because this case was never solved’.

Mr Koby said whilst there’s ‘nothing to prevent this case from going to trial’ he has faith in the current Boulder District Attorney to make the right call.

He said: 'The bottom line is this case is now as it was then. 

‘There have been no charges in the case. My hope is that (Boulder) District Attorney Stanley Garnett, who is a very capable District Attorney, will one day be able to do that (file charges).

‘The Ramsey case is one of a number of homicides that become unsolved. Thirty per cent of homicides in America are not resolved. This is no different.’

Calls to Mr Hunter’s home in Boulder, Colorado went unreturned.

MailOnline reached out to Mr Ramsey’s former lawyer L. Lin Wood but he has not called back.

The Boulder District Attorney’s office declined to comment.
