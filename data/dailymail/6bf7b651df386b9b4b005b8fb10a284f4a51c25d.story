The New Year is not yet a week old but already Rory McIlroy's love life is the subject of golf gossips across the globe.

The Open and US PGA Champion has been romantically linked with several glamourous girls since his split with Caroline Wozniacki last May, but this time there's a twist.

Remember when McIlroy nearly scuppered the Ryder Cup Miracle at Medinah before it had even started by oversleeping? Well, he is now reported to be dating the PGA employee who came to his rescue before police rushed him to the course that morning in September 2012.

Talk about a fairytale romance.

The girl in question is Erica Stoll, a stunning 27-year-old blonde, who is manager of Championship Volunteer Operations at the PGA of America.

The new couple have apparently been dating for around three months and, according to several Irish newspapers, saw in the New Year together at a luxury hotel in the 13th-century Ashford Castle in Co. Mayo. McIlroy shared a picture on Instagram that night of a champagne bottle with two glasses resting on napkins bearing the hotel's logo.

Just 12 months previously, Wozniacki had been showing off a shiny engagement ring after McIlroy had popped the question on New Year's Eve. He also had only two majors to his name and the world was wondering why his form on the course was so bad. How times change.

Since then the 25-year-old world No 1 has had rumoured romances with Irish model Nadia Forde, who went on to appear in I'm A Celebrity... Get Me Out of Here, receptionist Sasha Gale, South African model Shashi Naidoo and now Stoll.

Mclroy is back to work in preparation for his return to the course at the Abu Dhabi HSBC Golf Championship in the Emirate on January 15. His major aim this year will be to complete a career Grand Slam by winning the Masters in April. 

Should the Ulsterman claim the green jacket at Augusta National he would then have a shot at becoming the first golfer since Tiger Woods in 2001 to hold all the major titles at once when he competes in the US Open at Chambers Bay in June.

But it appears McIlroy could have found a birdie he cherishes even more than those he earns on the course in the form of his Ryder Cup heroine.
