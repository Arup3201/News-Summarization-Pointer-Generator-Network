One of the country’s most distinctive Morris dancing troupes is proud of its efforts to preserve an English tradition going back at least a century and a half.

Now it fears its days are numbered after council bureaucrats mounted an undercover operation to prove it breaches health and safety rules.

Members of the Britannia Coconut Dancers group blacken their faces and dress in skirts for an annual festival in the Lancashire town of Bacup.

The Britannia Coco-nutters may never dance at the event in Bacup, Lancashire, which is their biggest turnout every year

The group, known as the 'coconutters' take part every year in the event which lasts around 12 hours

Leaders of the troupe have been presented with a dossier of evidence – including surveillance photographs taken by officials posing as spectators – showing how crowds at this year’s event spilled on to the road.

The parade, traditionally held on Easter Saturday, was almost cancelled when Lancashire county council demanded safety measures costing £1,600, only to back down after a public outcry.

Now it has emerged that the event was secretly monitored, and the troupe has been told that in future it will have to pay for road closures or participants and spectators will have to stick to the pavement.

Yesterday leaders accused the council of trying to stamp out the tradition and said the demands were impractical.

The group’s treasurer, Neville Earnshaw, said: ‘If we had to stay on the pavement, we will be dancing into lampposts and bus stops. People will end up with no front teeth. It’s going to be more dangerous.’

Known as the ‘Nutters’, the group has paraded in Bacup every Easter for the past 110 years, although Morris dances have been held there since at least the mid-19th century.

Earlier this year, after police said they could no longer afford to patrol the 12-hour event, the council demanded £1,000 for road closures and £600 to train three volunteers to control traffic.

It backed down and the event went ahead, attended by 800 people, raising £600 for the local  air ambulance and a hospice.

However, when Mr Earnshaw, 66, and group secretary Joe Healey attended a meeting with the council this month to discuss next year’s 111th parade, they were stunned to see the dossier.

The Lancashire County Council officials allegedly posed as spectators at the event and then compiled a dossier claiming the dancers and their audience were breaching health and safety regulations

The council has demanded the group restrict their energetic dancing to the pavement during the 12-hour-long festival

The Britannia Coco-nutters have faced problems with Lancashire County Council in the past. They were requested to pay for road closures and train members of the troupe to direct traffic ahead of one year's event

‘First it was shock that the pictures
had been taken without us knowing,’ Mr Earnshaw, a retired fireman, 
said yesterday.

‘Then it was knowledge they were prepared to go down 
that road of covert pictures to get the event banned.

‘It’s all this red tape and health 
and safety ruling the roost and going over the top at the expense of our
finest English traditions.’

Last night Lancashire county council 
‘strongly disputed’ the dancers’ claim that the parade had been subject 
to secret monitoring.

It said: ‘We told them in advance our
traffic management people would be there to observe – our guys were 
there in high-visibility jackets with the council logo on.’

But Mr Earnshaw said: ‘That’s a lie. We didn’t know anything about it until we were shown the photographs.’

The troupe from Bacup, Lancashire, is over 150 years old with their origins dating back to the 18th and 19th centuries

The event in Bacup is the group's largest and most important performance of the year with over 800 people attending last year

The traditional Coco-nutter routine involves eight dancers and one 'whipper in' who leads proceedings.

The dance is believed to have been thought up by Moors who travelled to Cornwall before settling in Lancashire in the 1700-1800s. 

The theatrical performance includes flower hoops or garlands, extravagant costume and black face-paint, to ward off evil spirits.

Though their painted faces have been thought to mimic labourers from the past, the group insists the tradition stems back to a pagan method of disguise.

While the majority of Morris dancers wear bell pads on their shins, the Britannia Coco-nutters rely on their wooden clogs and an accompanying concertina for music.

The earliest known form of Morris dancing dates back to 1448.

The traditionally British dance has become popular abroad too, with more than 150 registered dance troupes in foreign countries.

Lancashire County Council claim to have explained their concerns to the dance troupe following a meeting at which local police were also present

The dance troupe is expected to reconvene to discuss the proposals made by council officials
