A Florida woman forced her two young children to drink toilet bowl cleaner and reportedly drank some herself Saturday in what police are calling an attempted murder-suicide.

Amelia West, 28, was found by officers responding to a reported suicide around 10:30am, along with her two young children, one of whom was only three months old.

Police say that West had forced her two children to ingest the cleaning liquid before taking some herself in an attempt to commit suicide.

The children were taken to Halifax Hospital for observation, though they were released without an major injuries.

West was charged with two counts of attempted murder and two counts of aggravated child abuse.

According to KCTV5, the Department of Children and Families placed the children with family members and is checking their records to see if there were any previous incidents involving West.

'We are checking to see if there are any other safety concerns for the children,' an official with the department said. 

'In these types of cases we will follow up to make sure that the children are receiving any follow up medical care that may be needed. 

At home: A neighbor said that West hardly went for a walk with her children and said she didn't socialize with other neighbors

A neighbor, Katherine Gardner, said that she never saw West with the kids outside the house and that the young mother did not socialize with her neighbors.

Toilet bowl cleaner, if ingested, can cause vomiting, loss of vision, difficulty breathing, headaches, seizure and even comas.
