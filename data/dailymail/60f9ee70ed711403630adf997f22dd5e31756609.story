David Moyes has written to every Manchester United season-ticket holder admitting he is 'desperate to compensate' for the dismal start to his reign. And he has again been forced to deny that Robin van Persie is increasingly disillusioned at Old Trafford.

Moyes’s stance follows comments from former Holland star Ronald de Boer that the striker is ‘not enjoying the football United are playing’ and will be off at the end of the season unless major signings are made. The United manager, whose plea for patience in his ‘difficult’ first season has received a mixed reaction on social media, denied Van Persie is unhappy at United and that there are divisions in his squad.

The controversy over Van Persie, which began following the shock 2-0 Champions League defeat at Olympiacos when he told a Dutch TV station that team-mates were running into his space, intensified with De Boer’s remarks. But Moyes hit back, saying: ‘Have I a reaction to what Robin said after Olympiacos? Do you know the whole transcript? Read it out in full and I will answer your question.

Apology: David Moyes has written a letter (below) to every Manchester United season ticket holder appologising for the team's poor form this season

Unrest: Robin van Persie continues to grow disillusioned with life at Old Trafford

'Look at the whole transcript, rather than that one bit that has been picked out. I have — and I have no issue with it whatsoever. When you hear it in full, you see what he is getting at and I understand totally where he was  coming from.

‘I travelled back with him from the Holland game the other night. I went to the game against France and then travelled back with him.

‘If anyone is suggesting certain players are not playing for me, I don’t know if that is the right thing.

‘I think they definitely are, so I don’t accept that. I’ve been honest with the players and the media and tried to be as straight as I can.

‘I’ve done it with the supporters as well and admitted we need to play better.

Poor: Moyes admitted the Olympiacos debacle was the poorest his team have played

We've been here before: Sir Alex Ferguson sent a letter to United fans in 1989

‘I think Olympiacos was the poorest we’ve played. It was disappointing, but we will improve.

‘The idea of the letter was simply that I was asked to put out something to the supporters and it was just to say, here we are — this is how it’s gone about.

‘But I think most United supporters totally understand the situation and they’ve shown that with their support and their backing wherever I’ve been —  not just at Old Trafford but everywhere that I go.

‘I’ve been to a lot of games all  over the world recently and all the  Manchester United followers I have bumped into have been supportive and shown they understand we’re having a difficult season.

‘They’re looking forward to it getting better.’

Chance: Manchester United will have to pick up three points against Pepe Mel's struggling West Brom

Partenrs: The Wayne Rooney-Van Persie partnership is not flourishing this season

In his letter, Moyes said he ‘firmly believed’ United would re-emerge as title contenders, particularly if they can turn Old Trafford into a ‘fortress’ once more, but admitted: ‘The difficult  season we have experienced was not something that I envisaged.’

With United seventh in the Barclays Premier League — 12 points off a  Champions League place — finding a way of rekindling Van Persie’s stuttering partnership with Wayne Rooney might help, starting at struggling West Bromwich Albion.

One person who is leaving United this summer is captain Nemanja Vidic.

Moving on: Nemanja Vidic will leave Old Trafford in the summer and join Inter Milan

Inter Milan announced on Thursday that Vidic had agreed to move to the Italian club at the end of the season, and Moyes was annoyed at the timing of the announcement.

Moyes said: 'I don't think we like it in this country. I don't think it's something that's done here.

'I can think of [Robert] Lewandowski going to Bayern Munich. I can think of [Mario] Gotze, who went last year between two of the biggest clubs in Germany. It's not something we like in this country, it's done more often elsewhere.

'But it's happened and we'll get on with it. Vida has been a brilliant servant for the club and we'll treat him with all the respect he deserves. I knew about January time that this would probably be his choice.'
