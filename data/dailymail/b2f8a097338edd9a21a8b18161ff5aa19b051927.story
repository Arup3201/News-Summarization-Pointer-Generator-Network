Katie Holmes is on the hunt to buy a new apartment in New York City - as she continues her new life as a single mom to daughter Suri.

The stunning actress, 34, who is currently on a sunshine break with Suri at Disney World in Orlando, secretly rented a two-bedroom apartment in the Chelsea Mercantile building weeks before filing for divorce from Tom Cruise last June.

With the end of the lease looming, Katie has started planning a move from the $12,500-a-month apartment she and six-year-old Suri have made home - and is looking to buy her own lofty apartment in Manhattan, MailOnline has learned.

'Come on Mum!': Suri Cruise seemed very excited about being at Disney World on Sunday with her mother Katie Holmes

Happy: Katie Holmes, seen here in Manhattan earlier this month, has made a new life for herself and daughter Suri since her split from Tom Cruise.

The dark-haired actress recently mounted a comeback by starring in Broadway play Dead Accounts, but the play closed ahead of schedule.

However, Katie loves the city and the security it has given both her and Suri since her divorce from Hollywood star Cruise, and sources say she wants to put down firm roots by buying her own property - as the actress also admitted that she would like more children.

Cruise, 50, owned a $15 million brownstone in Manhattan, but Katie moved into her own place following their split.

Her divorce settlement is believed to have barely left a dent in Cruise's estimated $250 million fortune.

Moving out? Katie Holmes is believed to be house hunting in Manhattan as the lease for her apartment in the Chelsea Mercantile building comes to an end.

Allegedly, she did not receive a lump sum payout, which was consistent with her pre-nuptial agreement with Cruise.

Although she does not receive spousal support, she does get money in child support for Suri.

According to the settlement, Cruise will pay Katie $400,000 a year in child support, totaling approximately $33,000 per month.

At the time of their divorce, which was finalised in August - just weeks after Katie stunned Cruise by serving him with divorce papers - TMZ reported that Cruise must pay support for Suri for the next 12 years, until she turns 18.

In total, it comes to around $4.8 million.

Cruise will also pay Suri’s expenses, including her schooling and extracurricular costs. One stipulation in their settlement is that Suri will not attend a “residential school,” which means she won’t be sent to a Scientology boarding school.

Suri is now happily at school at the private Avenues school in New York City.

Earlier this month, Katie told Allure magazine that although there's no man currently in her life, she would like to expand her family, adding: 'I don’t know. I’m open to it.'

Though she doesn’t talk directly about her divorce, she admitted, “A lot of people have gone through a lot of stuff,' as she said she’s hoping for a more “peaceful year for a lot of the people in the world.”

“When you look back on the last year, there were a lot of tragedies — Hurricane Sandy, the Connecticut shooting. I … I just hope it’s a good year for everyone,” she said.

Katie also played coy about rumors that she may be going to law school.

Well, my brother and father are attorneys, and — we’ll see. I like the practical thinking of attorneys,” she told the magazine.

Following Katie's move into the Mercantile, broker Ryan Serhant said the new tenant had ramped up attention from buyers.

He said: 'We went from showing once or twice a week to five showings today, four on Thursday and seven on Friday so far.'

Inspiration? Belle from Beauty And The Beast famously wears a yellow dress not too dissimilar to Suri's

While neighbor Christopher Hyland, 
whose own 4,000-square-foot pad was on the market for $23 million, told 
E! News it was 'a joy' to have Katie in the building.

'She
 is a jewel and class act,' Hyland said: 'This building knows 
celebrities from the day it has been opened...d the building is 
well-equipped to handle the famous faces, Hyland says, noting the 'great
 staff and security,' as well as amenities like in-house private 
laundry, cleaning and concierge services; a gym; a large rooftop deck; 
and a playroom for the building's smaller tenants.

Katie
 and Suri were wreathed in smiles as they were pictured at Disney World 
this week, as Katie happily took pictures of her daughter.

Suri, meanwhile, was clearly dressed in honour of a Disney favourite, Belle, wearing a pretty yellow dress.

Belle,
 who is the protagonist in Disney's Beauty And The Beast, famously wears
 a tiered yellow ball gown like Suri's, she also has similar brown hair.

Adding a kooky twist to her yellow 
ensemble, Suri wore a pair of pink-rimmed sunglasses, proving once again
 that she really is fashion forward.

Katie,
 meanwhile opted for a much more low key dress in brown and grey hues 
which fell to the middle of her thighs giving passersby a glimpse of her
 legs.

She elongated her slim pins with a pair of wedge tan sandals and she completed her look with a pair of large sunglasses.

While
 it may have been Suri leading the way walking around the park, Katie 
certainly seemed to get into the spirit of the place.

The
 actress joined her little girl on a carousel ride at the Florida resort
 and was seen taking a snapshot of the youngster on one of the 
merry-go-round horses.

For the ride the youngster looked like she had slipped into a princess style purple dress over her yellow one.

The Orlando resort had experienced a fierce storm hours earlier, but the famous fun seekers headed to enjoy the rides when the weather cleared up.

Suri is clearly a Disney fan and was last seen at Disney World with her father last August as she dressed up as Ariel from The Little Mermaid.

A spokeswoman for Katie has yet to comment.
