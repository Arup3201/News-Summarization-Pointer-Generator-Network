Winston Churchill’s unshakeable belief in victory made him one of history’s most celebrated wartime leaders.

But a remarkable discovery shows Churchill worried he had pushed his allies too far and feared he had started a war with France.

In one of the most controversial decisions ever taken by a Prime Minister, he ordered the bombing of the French fleet in North Africa sending 1,300 French sailors to their deaths.

History remembers Sir Winston Churchill for his determination and 
unshakeable belief in victory, but a telegram reveals he feared he'd pushed his allies too far

The top secret telegram reveals Churchill's fears Britain could end up at war with France as well as Germany after the Royal Navy bombed 
ally's ships.

Churchill was worried the Gallic fleet would fall into Hitler’s hands and they could then be used to invade Britain.

He gave the French an ultimatum: scuttle the ships or send them across the English Channel.

When the French failed to respond he took matters into his own hands and ordered the navy to launch a devastating bombardment of their ships in Mers-el-Kébir in Algeria.

The massacre sparked a diplomatic crisis and has been described as the French Pearl Harbour.

Many across the Channel have never forgiven him.

But while Churchill was widely lauded in the House of Commons for his courage in sending out the message that Britain would fight the Nazis – alone if necessary – a top secret telegram reveals he had his doubts.

A copy of which is now going under the hammer reads ‘British Naval forces...asked the French Naval authorities to take certain steps to prevent a number of important French Naval units at this port from falling into German hands undamaged.

‘The French declined to take these steps. Heavy action ensued between British and French Naval forces with great and much regretted loss to the French.

‘We cannot tell what the consequences may be, but every precaution should be taken in case the French declare war against us. Further particulars later.’

The telegram was sent by the War Office just hours after the bombing, effectively telling them to prepare for a French declaration of war on Britain.

It is believed this message, that is stamped ‘Secret Cipher Telegram’ and is headed ‘Secret’, was for Sir John Dill, the Chief of the Imperial General Staff, as there is a red tick next to his name.

It is a relative of his who is now selling at International Autograph Auctions in London.

The attack on the French came a month after 338,000 British troops were evacuated from Dunkirk and on the eve of the Battle of Britain.

When Churchill announced the news to the House of Commons he was cheered by all parties as it proved to the world, especially the US, that Britain was still up for the fight.

The French responded by launching a demonstration bombing of Gibraltar harbour.

The prominent French politician, Pierre Laval, also offered the Germans 500 French pilots for the Battle of Britain which was turned down by Hitler.

After the liberation of France in 1944, Laval was arrested, convicted of high treason and executed by firing squad.

Some French people understood the reason for the attack and the bereaved family of one sailor killed in it was buried with the French tricolour and the Union Jack.

Terry Charman, a historian at the Imperial War Museum, said: “It was an extremely controversial and unnatural thing to do as the French were our allies.

'But we just didn’t trust the word of their admiral who told Britain that rather than let his ships fall into German hands he would scuttle them.

'We couldn’t take the risk of them not doing it and Churchill ordered the attack.

'It was a calculated risk based Britain thinking the French was so demorilised they wouldn’t do anything.

'There was talk of the French wanting to declare war on us but all they did was a demonstration bombing of Gibralter harbour.

'The newly formed French State cut off diplomatic relations with Britain.

'General de Gaulle, the leader of the Free French in England, made a very dignified statement over the radio to the French people stating that he absolutely regretted what had happened but he rather the ships and men were killed than they become part of a German force.

'Winston Churchill announced the news of the attack in the House of Commons and he was applauded and cheered.

'It sent off signals to the US that Britain was still very determined to carry on the fight.'

The telegram is expected to fetch up to £200 when it gos under the hammer at International Auctions next month.
