Matt Wood, a victim of the Vauxhall Helicopter crash, had been on his way to work

The commuter killed in a helicopter fireball as he walked to work in central London had promised to take his sister down the aisle at her wedding following the death of their father, his devastated family revealed today.

Amanda Wood, 31, said her brother Matt Wood, 
39, was 'a big man with a big heart - a big friendly giant', and had 
taken the role of head of the family after their father Brian died of 
cancer last January.

She said: 'He was a big man with a big heart, a big friendly giant. He didn't have a bad word to say about anyone. He was always at the end of the phone if you needed him.

'He said he would be proud to walk me down the aisle when I eventually get married. He said he would be happy to have that privilege.'

Mr Wood was struck as he arrived at the Vauxhall office of Rentokil just after 8am yesterday, when the helicopter piloted by Pete Barnes hit a crane and crashed to the street below.

Miss Wood said their mother was struggling to cope because their father had also died this time last year.

She told the Daily Mail: 'He was a big friendly giant, the nicest possible guy. He would always put people before himself, although he didn’t have children of his own, he had many god children who he loved.

'Matt was going to turn 40 in April and was planning his birthday celebrations. We’re all in shock, we lost our father this time last year so my mother is struggling.'

The crash, which happened at 8am 
yesterday in fog, also killed the helicopter pilot and left 12 injured. 
But police said it was ‘a miracle’ that the toll was not higher after 
the helicopter sliced through the crane ‘as if it was a piece of paper’,
scattering wreckage over the busy streets.

Mr
Wood had been on his way to work as an area manager for Rentokil in 
Wendle Court.

His brother Darren said he had been killed because he was 
'always early or on time' for work. Mr Wood, 35, said: 'That’s the kind of guy he was. If only he had been late this one time.'

Darren last heard from Matt was when he had text him to check on his baby nephew who was in hospital.

He said: 'I had text back to say he was ok and Matt said 
‘great news, speak soon’. And that was the last I heard from him.'

After
hearing about the crash on the news the family frantically tried to get
in touch with him knowing it was the route he took to work. The police 
broke the tragic news to them at 3pm.

Alan Brown, CEO of Rentokil Initial, 
said: ‘We can confirm that our Rentokil Initial colleague, Matt Wood, 
was fatally injured in this morning’s helicopter crash as he was walking
to our office in Vauxhall. 

'Matt was 39 years old and had worked for Rentokil as an administrative team leader since 2003.

'Matt was well known to all of us who 
visit the Vauxhall office, including myself. He was in every respect a 
warm and generous man and a cornerstone of our team in Vauxhall.

'We extend our deepest sympathy to 
Matt’s family and to our colleagues in Vauxhall who, though safely 
evacuated, will be deeply affected by this tragic accident.'

An elderly woman neighbour, who lived
in the flat below his, did not want to give her name but said: 
‘We didn't see each other a lot but when we did we would always chat.

‘Matthew was a very nice man, very 
mild-mannered. He was a bit of a gentle giant, a physically big man but 
very polite and pleasant. He'd lived there for quite a few years.

‘When he first moved in it was with a
girlfriend but she didn't stay around long. I don't know what her name 
was or what happened between them.

Pete Barnes had racked up 10,500 miles of flying time over 25 years and had worked for ambulance services

‘Since then it's just been him in the flat and his two cats. The cats are still there. I can hear them scratching around. I expect they will need rescuing - they must be hungry.

‘When he went on holiday someone would come round and feed them but I don't know who it was. Hopefully they will come and get the cats. It's absolutely terrible what happened to him.’

His friend Darren Beasley said on Facebook: ‘Absolutely gutted to hear that one of the deaths at the helicopter crash yesterday was Matt Atwell Wood.

‘A good mate, a wealth of music and the original anti-Emo! R.I.P Dude. Many fond memories of Hot Rocks and Raw Rock...man you pretty much shaped part of my musical landscape. Rest easy.’

And Lorna Stevens posted: 'Gonna miss you big fella, you always lightened up my day and were a fantastic friend, all my love xx.'

Pilot Mr Barnes, 50, had worked as a pilot for police and air ambulance 
services and had been praised for his ‘courage and skill’ during the 
dramatic rescue of a motorist from a flooded ford.

But his extensive experience could not prevent yesterday’s tragedy, which also killed Mr Wood, during morning rush-hour.

Shortly before 8am, Mr Barnes’s 
helicopter spun out of control and crash-landed near Vauxhall station, 
south London, after he attempted to divert to a helipad due to bad 
weather. He was not carrying any passengers.

Mr Barnes’s eight-seater helicopter 
was owned by Cornwall-based Castle Air but was leased to RotorMotion, 
which is based at Redhill Aerodrome in Surrey.

Privately-educated Mr Barnes, a 
father of two, had previously described himself as ‘the luckiest pilot 
around’ after surviving a helicopter crash 15 years ago when the 
electrics failed but he managed to bring the aircraft down in a field.

A friend said: ‘Pete used to show 
people pictures of the wreckage of the helicopter and say it was a 
miracle he survived.

'Apparently his electrics failed and he lost 
control. I believe he had passengers on board and they were amazed by 
the skills he used to guide the chopper down.

‘He used to say he was the safest 
pilot around because most people don’t survive one crash and the fact 
that he had meant that he was unlikely to have another.’

‘I suppose it was a bit like being hit by lightning.’

Mr Barnes lived with his partner Rebecca, 38, their daughter, 12, and son, eight, near Mortimer, Berkshire.

Witnesses described hearing a loud bang and seeing a flash of light as the helicopter collided with the high-rise crane. Mr Barnes and Mr Wood died in the incident

Police have been amazed that more people were not hurt in the incident, which saw the helicopter plummet to the ground

The streets were flooded with emergency services trying to help the injured and put out the flames. The collision claimed two lives

During his 25-year career, he also 
worked as a contract pilot on adverts, TV programmes and Hollywood films
including Bond movie Die Another Day, The Golden Compass, Agent Cody 
Banks 2, Tomb Raider 2 and Saving Private Ryan.

In an interview with a local paper in 
2006, Mr Barnes described his varied professional life, saying: ‘One 
minute you’re flying paramedics to scenes of carnage and devastation, 
then you’re flying VIPs and doing corporate entertainment at Ascot, 
Silverstone and the world rally driving championships.

The report described how Captain 
Barnes meticulously co-ordinated stunts in Hollywood films, such as a 
multiple abseil from a helicopter in Agent Cody Banks 2.

When not working on films, he 
regularly took celebrities and A-list stars to and from yachts in Monaco
and also flew race-goers to Ascot dressed in a top hat and tails.

One picture shows him beside a helicopter with Formula One racing driver Lewis Hamilton.

Working as what he described as an ‘aerial chauffeur’, he ferried world leaders to and from the 2005 G8 conference in Scotland.

Between 1997 and 2011, Mr Barnes 
worked for the police and air ambulances in Yorkshire, Wiltshire, 
Nottinghamshire and Lincolnshire.

In 2004 he helped save a motorist 
trapped in his Audi in the flooded Stanhope Ford, County Durham, 
described by a local paper as a  ‘rescue reminiscent of a Hollywood 
movie’.

With the water level reaching the 
motorist’s chest, Mr Barnes managed to keep the helicopter steady a foot
above the car despite heavy winds while a paramedic jumped on to the 
roof and pulled the 40-year-old man out of a side window.

He also piloted for the BBC and Sky 
News and previously worked as a broadcaster giving travel reports for 
Metro FM in the North East.

Speaking from Mr Barnes’ family home, 
where relatives had gathered, his older brother Christopher said: ‘He 
was a great guy. We’re obviously devastated for Pete and for the other 
person who died and the people who have been injured.

‘He was a very experienced pilot, he’d
got 10,000 plus hours flying experience and had been flying for 25 
years.’ After graduating with a degree in business studies, Mr Barnes 
worked as a ski instructor and guide in Europe before going into 
advertising.

He later trained as a helicopter pilot
in the US, earning a US Commercial and Instructors Licence flying 
helicopters around Florida and the East Coast.

He moved back to the UK and in 1998 he formed his own business, Helivision, managing aircraft and offering filming services.
