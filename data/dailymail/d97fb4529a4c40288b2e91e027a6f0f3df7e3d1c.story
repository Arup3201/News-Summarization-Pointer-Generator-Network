Roma have made an enquiry to take defender Mapou Yanga-Mbiwa from Newcastle.

The France international - who arrived at St James' Park with a big reputation in January 2013 - also has an offer on the table from Marseille.

Yanga-Mbiwa, 25, captained Montpellier to the French title in 2011-12 but has failed to live up to his reputation in England. 

Pastures new: Mapou Yanga-Mbiwa could be heading to Roma or Marseille 

He is yet to play for Newcastle this season with Mike Williamson and captain Fabricio Coloccini boss Alan Pardew's preferred central defensive partnership. 

Yanga-Mbiwa has made 46 appearances in all competitions for the Magpies and has been capped three times by France.
