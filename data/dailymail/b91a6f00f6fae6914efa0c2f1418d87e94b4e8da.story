If this nine-year-old boy's reaction is anything to go by, the Coalition's plan to allow homeowners to build small extensions or conservatories without needing planning permission is an absolute stinker.

Young Josh Wood appeared to stare with disbelief as David Cameron announced the policy - and his partner in crime Nick Clegg didn't look that interested either.

Today the Prime Minister and his deputy were at a new housing development in Cheshunt, Hertfordshire, to announce they would sweep away planning rules and bureaucracy so homes, shops, offices and industrial units will be allowed to expand with no need to ask their local authority.

Perhaps realising he needed more convincing, the Prime Minister and Nick Clegg then popped for a cup of tea with Josh and his mother to explain their planning reforms further.

Joint effort: David Cameron and Nick Clegg are watched by the less than impressed Josh Wood, 9, as they launched their planning changes in Cheshunt, Hertfordshire today

The move is designed to encourage 
conservatories, loft extensions or garage conversions, and support 
businesses which want to grow or diversify.

However, it will also mean residents no longer have a right to challenge thousands of construction schemes on neighbouring properties, even if they believe it will have an adverse impact on them.

In other plans, the Government is to offer up to £10billion in state-backed guarantees to encourage housing developments, a move which ministers believe could mean 100,000 homes being built over three years.

Rules on how many affordable homes must be included in a development may also be relaxed.

There will be help for 16,500 first-time buyers, who will be offered equity loans of up to 20 per cent of the property value that can be used as a deposit.

New ‘permitted development rights’ will 
be introduced to allow a change of use from commercial to residential 
purposes – although local authorities will be able to seek exemptions 
where they believe there will be a negative economic impact

It means disused offices or light 
industrial premises will be able to switch to residential developments 
with no need for planning permission.

Currently, homeowners need planning permission to make any change that extends more than a few feet from their property’s rear wall, requiring them to fill in complicated application forms that typically take eight weeks or more to be considered.

Ministers say this adds unnecessary cost and delays to people’s improvement plans.

Under
the new system, the size of extensions allowed without permission, 
therefore, will be doubled to about 20 feet for terraced properties and 
26 feet for detatched.

The change will not apply in protected areas, including conservation areas, World Heritage Sites, the Broads and areas of outstanding natural beauty, where development rights are already more limited.

Under changes, businesses will be able to expand premises by 100 square metres and industrial units by 200 square metres, and shops and offices will be permitted to develop up to the boundary of the premises.

Every year there are more than 400,000 planning applications processed, with almost 200,000 for residential improvements, many of which are for changes such as conservatories or extensions.

Ministers say the changes will provide a crucial and immediate stimulus to the construction sector.

There will be a month-long consultation on the measures before they are implemented later in the year.

‘This government means business in delivering plans to help people build new homes and kick-start the economy,' the Prime Minister and Deputy Prime Minister will say.

‘We’re determined to cut through the bureaucracy that holds us back. 

Yep, this one should protect me from booing crowds: Chancellor of the Exchequer George Osborne points at at a Bushmaster vehicle during a visit to defence contractor Thales' facility in Glasgow today

You could record your Budget speech with one of those: The Chancellor was accompanied on his tour by chief executive of Thales UK Victor Chavez (right)

‘That starts with getting the planners off our backs, getting behind the businesses that have the ambition to expand, and meeting the aspirations of families that want to buy or improve a home.’

A Government source added: ‘We want to make it easier for families to undertake home improvements: not just to cut red tape and strengthen individual homeowners’ rights, but also to help generate economic activity which will support small traders in particular.’
