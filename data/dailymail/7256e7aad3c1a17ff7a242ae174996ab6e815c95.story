Jailed: Abbi Kinsella was jailed today after stealing her elderly mother's £100,000 life savings - leaving her 'homeless, penniless and in debt'

A lottery winner was jailed today after stealing her elderly mother's £100,000 life savings - leaving her 'homeless, penniless and in debt'.

Abbi Kinsella, dubbed the 'wicked witch', stole the money from 88-year-old dementia sufferer, Margaret Bowyer, after her winnings ran out.

She used £34,000 of the cash to feed her online bingo habit - while thousands more was spent on holidays in the exclusive resort of St Tropez in the South of France.

Now, the 54-year-old, who won £175,000 on the lottery in 1999, has been jailed for four years after being convicted of four charges of stealing and admitting one offence of fraud.

Stafford Crown Court heard that Mrs Bowyer had sold her own property in Swadlincote, Derbyshire, and banked money from the sale, before moving to Tamworth in Staffordshire.

The widow rented a house next door to Kinsella's home, which has a sign outside featuring a black plastic crow above the warning: 'Beware of the witch'.

But over the next three years, more than £61,000 was transferred from Mrs Bowyer's bank account to her daughter's, while a number of cash withdrawals were made, totalling more than £38,000.

Meanwhile, Kinsella was spending thousands of pounds of her mother's money on online bingo and luxury holidays, as well as £200 on a Sky TV subscription, the court heard.

After plundering the account, Kinsella cancelled her mother’s direct debit payments for her rent, gas, electric, water and council tax in April 2011.

As a result, Mrs Bowyer was left with £20,000 in unpaid bills - and was eventually evicted from her home in November 2012.

The pensioner, who was too ill to give evidence at court, is now in a care home for the elderly.

Sign: The 54-year-old's house has a black circular sign on the outside wall, reading: 'Beware of the witch'

Andrew Wallace, prosecuting, said 
Kinsella had 'totally abused her position as Mrs Bowyer’s daughter .....
 throwing her mother out on the street, penniless, and then lied about 
it'.

Meanwhile, Mark Nicholls, 
defending, said the mother of two's partner, John Causer, 53, had 'turned his 
back on her' and ended the relationship after reading in the press about what she had done.

The couple had regularly held fancy dress parties at their modern three-bedroom terrace, according to neighbours, and Kinsella had been known to dress up as a witch.

'It is questionable whether she will ever see her mother in the future,' Mr Nicholls added.

Social services referred Mrs Bowyer’s case to the police in November 2012 and her daughter was arrested a month later.

When
 questioned, Kinsella said she had stopped rent payments going out of 
the account in April 2011 because the owner of the property owed them 
some money for ‘doing the back garden’.

She said she had restarted rent payments in cash, but hadn’t got any receipts for it.

During an earlier trial, Kinsella, a one-time Avon lady, had denied stealing the cash, but a jury took just 20 minutes to convict her of four charges of theft from Mrs Bowyer.

However, she did admit to making a false statement to her brother, Steve Bowyer, in which she claimed their mother’s money was in a bank account requiring 90 days' notice of withdrawal.

Sentencing Kinsella, Judge Mark Eades told her: 'You betrayed your mother’s trust in a callous and unfeeling fashion. You bled her finances dry. We came to your trial here and you gave evidence.

'You lied and lied and lied and lied and as each lie was demonstrated to be false you lied upon lie. You are a serial liar who has no conscience at all. You enjoyed living way beyond your means.

'You had a win on the lottery, you won a substantial sum that you got through very quickly and I dare say you enjoyed the freedom that win gave you. But when that money ran out, it strikes me, you had difficulty coming to terms with the position you were in before your win.'

Not at home: Kinsella has now been jailed for four years for four charges of stealing and one offence of fraud

In a Proceeds of Crime application, 
Judge Eades ruled that Kinsella had benefited by £100,966 - but because 
she has no assets, he ordered her to pay just £1.

Following the trial, Detective Constable Mark Woodings, who investigated the case, branded Kinsella's actions 'heartless and callous'.

He said: 'The victim is an extremely vulnerable elderly lady. When she became unable to manage her own financial affairs due to the onset of dementia, the family entrusted Kinsella to look after her interests and welfare.

'Kinsella went on to abuse that trust in a most heartless and callous way, stealing every penny of her mother’s life savings. She systematically and repeatedly helped herself to over £100,000 in order to feed a gambling habit and to live a life beyond her means.

'Her actions have left a proud lady homeless, penniless and in debt for the first time in her life.

'The family have found it difficult to comprehend and fully accept the lengths that Kinsella has gone to in order to steal from her own mother.'
