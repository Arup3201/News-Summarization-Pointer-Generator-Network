He is known for his love of 'chillaxing', and David Cameron looked particularly laid-back today as he soaked up the sun with his family at the Cornbury Music Festival in the Cotswolds.

However, the Prime Minister raised eyebrows with his choice of attire as he walked around the site barefoot and appeared to be sporting a pair of fake Ray-Ban sunglasses - suggesting that he may have fallen victim of the government's austerity measures.

Mr Cameron donned some black plastic 'Ray-Beri' sunglasses to the festival, which has become known as 'Poshstock' after the Tory leader and other members of the 'Chipping Norton set' became regular attendees.

Cost-effective: The Prime Minister sported a pair of knock-off Ray-Ban sunglasses at the event

Bargain: The 'Ray-Beri' shades fetch as little as £1.99 on eBay compared to more than £120 for real Ray-Bans

The knock-off sunglasses fetch as little as £1.99 on auction site eBay, while original Ray-Bans cost upwards of £120.

Mr Cameron, who earns £142,500 per year, caused controversy at last year's festival after he was spotted chatting with his former spin doctor Andy Coulson.

Rebekah Brooks, a friend of the Prime 
Minister, also attended in 2012. The former Sun editor and her 
husband Charlie stand accused of conspiracy to pervert the course of 
justice in relation to the investigation into the phone-hacking scandal.
Both have denied wrongdoing.

Sporting a black polo shirt with khaki shorts and flip-flops this afternoon, Mr Cameron was joined by Samantha and their three children on the second day of the three-day event on the Great Tew Estate, in his Witney constituency.

The Camerons - along with their children Nancy, Arthur and Florence - shared a private lunch with the estate’s owners before heading to the main arena at the festival.

The Conservative leader was then seen admiring a stall of colourful tutus with eldest daughter Nancy before the family were whisked away from the festival’s campsite.

The festival boasts music across four stages and also has an exclusive VIP area.

On the festival’s website, the 'eclectic and eccentric' event is described as a 'dynamic summer festival disguised as a country fayre - a lovingly crafted, top notch, very English open air party, tailor-made for the whole family'.

The site adds: 'Like the best of England, Cornbury is eccentric, charming and irresistible - a homespun melting pot where music-lovers share pies and a glass of champagne with superstars, toffs, rockers, crooners, Morris dancers, farmers, urbanites, fashionistas, gourmet chefs and the little old ladies who make exceptional cakes.'

Actress Tina Hobley - who recently announced she would be leaving TV drama Holby City - was also spotted among festival-goers.

Weekend tickets to the festival, 
headlined by Keane, cost £165 without camping, while individual 
day tickets for Sunday's entertainment cost £85 each 
for adults and £20 each for children.
