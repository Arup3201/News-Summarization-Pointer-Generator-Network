A majestic flotilla of 94 yachts sailed out of Sydney Harbour today for the 69th Sydney to Hobart race. 

Skippers have been warned of gale-force winds over the weekend and an especially challenging and unpredictable run to the Tasmanian capital.

Jessica Watson, the youngest person to circumnavigate the globe solo at the age of 16, is aiming to become the youngest female sailor to win at the age of 20.

She has already competed in the race taking part in 2011 and is aboard Perpetual Loyal.

The supermaxis, including defending champion Wild Oats XI and its local challenger Perpetual Loyal, are expected to sail up the mouth of the Derwent River sometime on Saturday.

The remainder of the fleet are forecast to face winds of 40-60 knots and waves of up to 12 metres early on Sunday just as they enter the notoriously volatile Bass Strait.

However, a repeat of the major storm that sank five yachts and killed six sailors in 1998 is unlikely.

While the bigger boats, including the super maxis, should be finished before the bad weather hits, the smaller and slower boats might have problems with the large seas.

The international competition has been boosted by 12 boats from the Clipper Round the World Race, which for the first time is including the iconic ocean classic often referred to simply as 'The Hobart', as part of its 40,000 nautical mile, 11-month race.

The Sydney to Hobart is a sporting staple of the festive season in Australia with the race start being held during the lunch break of the first day of the fourth Ashes test match at the Melbourne Cricket Ground.

Wild Oats XI holds the race record of one day, 18 hours, 23 minutes and 12 seconds set last year and is attempting to win the race for a record-equalling seventh time.

There were 94 starters in this year's race, including 22 from outside Australia.

'Treacherous conditions as far as the winds and the waves go,' Bureau of Meteorology official Andrew Treloar said at the final pre-race weather briefing Thursday. 

Vicky Ellis, of Bristol, England, was at the helm of the yacht Switzerland, which was in 58th place and about 25 nautical miles behind the leaders early Thursday evening.

Ellis said in a telephone interview that Switzerland needed to make up ground after being slow at the start. 

'It's going very well now, but it wasn't one of our better starts,' Ellis said. 'But the yachts we are overtaking now are bigger than us, so I hope we'll be moving up overnight.'

Noting the bad weather forecast for late Saturday, Ellis said: I'm hoping we'll be finished by then.'

The race to Hobart covers 628 nautical miles, or 723 miles. 

The fleet moves down the southeast coast of the Australian mainland, then across the often treacherous Bass Strait to the island state of Tasmania. 

The final portion of the race sees the fleet move up the Derwent River and to Constitution Dock in Hobart, the Tasmanian capital. 

Perpetual Loyal skipper Bell flew in American navigator Stan Honey, who masterminded the 2011 line honors win of Bell's previous boat.

Another crew member on Bell's yacht this year is 2012 London Olympics laser gold medalist Tom Slingsby, the Australian who was strategist on the winning Team Oracle USA boat at this year's America's Cup.
