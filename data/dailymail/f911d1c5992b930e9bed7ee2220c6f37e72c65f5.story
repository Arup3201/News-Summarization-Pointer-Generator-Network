Brad Barritt has had enough of being pigeon-holed, so when he confronts England rival Billy Twelvetrees on Saturday afternoon, the Saracens centre will aim to tackle the perception that he is solely a defensive force.

The 28-year-old has been cleared to play after missing last week’s defeat at Bath with a minor calf injury. It is no coincidence that in his absence, his club lost. Saracens were only beaten three times in the league phase of the Aviva Premiership last season and each time, Barritt was not on duty. He is the man who leads the line – setting the tone for the fabled ‘Wolf-pack’ defence.

But that is not all he does, as he has shown in a barnstorming start to this season, notable for his dynamic ball-carrying. There is a clear sense that the England No 12 shirt remains up for grabs and Barritt is convinced he has the requisite all-round credentials.

While Kyle Eastmond received the Premiership Player of the Month award for his midfield feats on behalf of Bath, he was replaced at half-time during England’s last match, as they capitulated against the All Blacks in Hamilton. Gloucester captain Twelvetrees was dropped after a hit-and-miss display in Dunedin, while Luther Burrell was also demoted but is another strong inside centre option.

Having made more appearances in that position than anyone else during Stuart Lancaster’s tenure as head coach, Barritt is fed up with faint praise for his defensive work. 

‘It is something I’m very proud of and it is a key component in a centre’s game, but it can be a bit of a frustration because my attacking contribution can often get over-looked because of what I do in defence,’ he said.

‘There have been numerous games where I’ve made a big contribution in attack, like Clermont last year – when I was involved in three assists for tries we scored. Going back to our (England) win over New Zealand in 2012, I contributed a try and an assist, and had numerous attacking involvements across the park.

‘Ultimately, I will do whatever the job requires and that is my character; I will do whatever the team needs. But I do think I am very capable of providing that ball-carrying ability and distribution ability and acting as a second 10, as well as knuckling down when the team needs me. I feel like I’m in a good place in terms of my all-round role as a 12.’

Lancaster likes the principal of having two footballing backs who can act as playmakers, whether that is at 10 and 12 or 10 and 15. With that in mind, Barritt worked hard on the New Zealand tour to enhance his kicking game and believes the results are apparent.

‘We have scored a few tries from situations where I’ve put the ball on my foot and sent it behind the first line of defence,’ he said. ‘That is something I did at the end of last season against the Crusaders and it is something I spent a lot of time on the tour working on with Mike Catt and Andy Farrell. I put a lot of emphasis on it and it’s something I have definitely added to my game.’

Another string to his bow this season has been a stint as stand-in captain, while Alistair Hargreaves was out of action. ‘I have enjoyed it,’ said Barritt. ‘I pride myself on being ultra-competitive and being a leader. In difficult situations I like to think I’m a player who stands up.’

He will relish Saturday's intriguing duel with Twelvetrees, the Gloucester captain and seek to harness a fervent desire to regain his status as a fixture in the England back line. ‘It is something I think about every day,’ he said.

In the past, he has formed an effective midfield alliance with Manu Tuilagi and as the powerful Tiger is sure to feature at outside centre providing he is fit, Barritt is keen to resurrect their partnership, which was so instrumental in the record win over New Zealand two years ago. He remains in the coaches’ thoughts and he is hopeful about his autumn prospects.

‘There is still a huge amount to play for at 12,’ said Barritt. ‘It is a position where there have been injuries and different people have had opportunities. Guys have come in and come out of the team. The tour ended very positively for me, I had some great feedback from the coaches and I have started this season thinking it is an open door.’
