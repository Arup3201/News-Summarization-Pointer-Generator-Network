Tony Colston-Hayter, pictured in 1989, has this week admitted his role in a £1.3million bank heist

He made a name for himself as the ‘Acid House King’ organising Britain’s biggest raves where children as young as 12 were plied with drugs.

But today detectives know Tony Colston-Hayter by a different guise- Mr Big.

This week he admitted masterminding a million pound cyber bank heist from one of Britain’s biggest high street banks.

The 48-year-old led a gang who hijacked bank computers to siphon off £1.3million from Barclays in a sophisticated scam.

The computer genius also stole the bank cards of 24,000 customers to pay for shopping sprees at Harrods and Selfridges splashing out on £35,000 Rolex watches.

Police believe the fraudster, who once famously handcuffed himself to Jonathan Ross to promote his parties, also targeted celebrities.

Amongst the vast array of 400,000 pages of personal data and stolen banking documentation found at his flat in Marylebone, police found the emails of comedian Stephen Merchant, although he denied hacking into them with the intention of stealing from the TV writer.

Now after he pleaded guilty to one of Britain’s biggest cyber bank robberies at Southwark Crown Court this week, Colston-Hayter’s extraordinary downfall from millionaire entrepreneur and party organiser to cyber crime’s ‘Mr Big’ can be revealed.

Colston-Hayter’s name was once synonymous with the all night Acid House raves held in the Home Counties which caused outrage in 1989.

The Sunrise events run by Colston-Hayter and promoted by his friend Paul Staines, the political commentator known as Guido Fawkes, attracted thousands of schoolchildren and drug dealers who openly sold drugs such as ecstasy and LSD to revellers.

When the parties were banned on the orders the then Home Secretary Douglas Hurd, Colston-Hayter went on the Jonathan Ross chat show and famously handcuffed himself to the presenter before throwing a glass of water over music journalist Paul Morley.

During a heated exchange, a fuming Ross told the cocky 23-year-old: ‘If you do that again I’ll thump you- and I mean it.’

The wealthy son of a university lecturer and a solicitor, Colston-Hayter enjoyed a privileged upbringing growing up in the plush suburb of Hampstead with his sisters Millie and Charlotte, now a TV producer whose credits include Celebrity Detox, TFI Friday and Celebrity Wife Swap.

Fixated on earning money, his father Anthony, a lecturer in modern history at the University of Buckingham, was said to have paid his ‘genius’ son by the page to read the Bible.

At the age of 16, he astonished his teachers by passing a special O-level in fruit machine technology after persuading the headmaster of the highly liberal Stantonbury Campus comprehensive school to let him set up a clubroom at school with a coin-operated video game he profited from.

On leaving school a few months later, he persuaded a bank manager to loan him £500 to set up a video game business which enjoyed a million-pound turnover by the time he was 19 before crashing with debts of £108,000.

Colston-Hayter then spent six months 
learning to play Blackjack in Monte Carlo before becoming a highly 
successful professional gambler.

He once raked in £23,000 a day before banned from every casino in Britain after winning more than £100,000 in a year.

Colston-Hayter
 later travelled to Hong Kong where he set up an engineering company 
which produced a component for a Formula One car.

But when he moved back to Britain to marry and start a young family, police believe he became an accomplished fraudster.

The father of two amassed 24,000 credit cards and financial records which had been diverted in the post to his address.

He used a 24 SIM phone exchange, a sophisticated telecoms machine which allowed him to impersonate High Street banks in order to solicit account details from hapless customers.

Southwark Crown Court heard on Monday that he led a gang who stole £1.3million from a bank branch in Swiss Cottage in North London by taking control of its computer system.

Fraudsters used a keyboard video mouse to take control of the bank’s computers remotely and siphon off the cash.

The gadget, which can be purchased for as little as £10, enables thieves to take control of multiple computers and to transmit information from them to a remote location.

Around £1.3m was stolen from accounts at the branch, although a significant amount of cash has since been recovered.

Police were alerted when stolen credit cards were used to buy a number of Rolex watches in Harrods and Selfridges.

This week Colston-Hayter pleaded guilty to conspiracy to steal credit balances from Barclays Bank.

He also admitted conspiring with others to commit fraud using credit cards, conspiracy to steal and two counts of possession of articles for use in fraud.

Southwark Crown Court heard that Colston-Hayter led a gang who stole £1.25million from a bank branch in Swiss Cottage in North London by taking control of its computer system. They will be sentenced next month

In an earlier hearing, he denied interfering with emails of the comedian Stephen Merchant with the intention of committing fraud or theft.

The charge will now lay on file.

Judge Alistair McCreath remanded him in custody ahead of sentencing which is due to take place later this year.

Co-conspirators Darius Bolder, 34, and Michael Harper, 26, pleaded guilty to using a stolen credit card to buy three Rolex watches at Selfridges.

Bolder also admitted stealing credit balances from Barclays.

Segun Ogunfidodo, 26, and Leroy Odunusi, 24, also pleaded guilty to conspiring to commit fraud using credit cards.

Five other alleged conspirators face a trial later this year.
