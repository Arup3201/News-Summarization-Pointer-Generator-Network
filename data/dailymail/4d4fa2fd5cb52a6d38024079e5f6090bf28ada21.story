Diego Simeone wants Atletico Madrid's fans to roar their team to victory in Tuesday night's Champions League last-16 second leg against Bayer Leverkusen.

Last season's runners up find themselves 1-0 down after the first leg but Simeone believes the club's supporters can play a significant role at the Vicente Calderon.

Spanish newspaper Marca say that there will be 55,000 Cholos (Simeone's nickname) in the stadium on Tuesday night, while as have called on Los Rojiblancos to 'get into them'.

Speaking at a press conference on Monday, Simeone said: 'I want to see the Calderon at its best – noisy and pushing us on to do what we have to do.

'I hope the stadium doesn't stop for even one minute and our aim is to win the game. If we don't concede and don't score we are out.

'We'll have to break quickly as soon as they lose the ball because that will be the key to attacking them. They know how to close off all routes to goal if you hesitate and that's what happened to us in Germany.

'They stopped us going forward and they could cause us problems if we don't break quickly.'

Over in Italy, much of the press coverage concentrates on the results of Monday night's three Serie A games.

Elsewhere, Corriere dello Sport take a look at Juventus' Champions League last-16 second leg against Borussia Dortmund on Wednesday night.
