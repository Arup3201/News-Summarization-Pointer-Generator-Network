West Bromwich Albion are willing to listen to offers for club record signing Brown Ideye, who Tony Pulis says 'has a cloud hanging over him at the moment'.

Ideye missed a glorious chance against Hull to justify some of his £10million fee and has looked bereft of confidence since joining from Dynamo Kiev.

Pulis is determined to bring in a striker to share the goal burden on Saido Berahino this transfer window, and Ideye could leave to raise funds.

The striker has scored just two goals since arriving from Dynamo Kiev for a club record £10million

'I can't say he's staying,' said Pulis. 'If someone comes in and offers an enormous amount of money the club looks at it. That's the same with every player. Every club I've been at has worked that way.

'If something comes on the table you sit down and look at it, take a view of whether it's right for the club or not. That will be the same with Brown.' 

Ideye has scored just twice since his move last summer, a tap-in from two yards in the Capital One Cup and a ball deflecting off the back of his head late on against Manchester City.

The West Brom head coach added: 'He needs a goal. He can't buy a goal at the moment. But you have a look at what he did (against Hull), the effort and commitment he put in, the way he worked for the team.

Baggies boss Tony Pulis has admitted that the club will listen to offers for Ideye in January

'He worked very hard and linked play well at times. He's just a little bit disappointed he hasn't scored. If he'd have taken that chance you would have seen a different player.

'He's got a cloud hanging over him at the moment. If we can lift that cloud and release him a little bit. English football, especially the Premier League, is different to football on the continent.

'It takes a while to get used to. I'm not just talking about Brown, lots of players. You have to give them time and assurance if they keep working hard it will come for them.'
