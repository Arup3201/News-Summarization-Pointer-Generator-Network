Cristiano Ronaldo appeared to have a short fuse in training on Monday as the Portuguese superstar swore at his Real Madrid team-mate Angel di Maria on more than one occasion.

Ronaldo was involved in a piggy in the middle training drill where the former Manchester United forward had to win the ball back from one of his team-mates.

The 29-year-old managed to intercept a pass by swiping at the legs of Di Maria before directing two angry gesture towards the Argentine international.

Ronaldo may have just been mucking about with his team-mate, although he didn't look best pleased about the situation.

The pair may not be team-mates for much longer as Di Maria has been linked with a move to Manchester United.

Louis van Gaal is readying an offer for Di Maria in the region of £50million and will offer the attacker a five-year deal.

Possible departure: Di Maria could be allowed to leave the Santiago Bernabeu this summer
