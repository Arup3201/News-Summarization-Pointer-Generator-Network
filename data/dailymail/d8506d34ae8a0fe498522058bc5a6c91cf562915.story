The model of helicopter that crashed on Friday was grounded last year amid safety concerns.

Safety regulators issued an emergency alert over the Eurocopter EC135 after a fault was found on an aircraft used by the Scottish Ambulance Service.

The helicopter had been found to have a crack on a rotor blade – a problem which experts said could cause it to crash. It led to air ambulance operators across the UK grounding helicopters as a ‘precautionary measure’, although they were later cleared to fly.

The European Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) also ordered a worldwide inspection of all 1,000 helicopters of the same model – which would have included the seven-year-old aircraft that crashed on Friday.

EASA’s report said an investigation had found problems with deformed safety pins which ‘if not detected and corrected, could lead to further crack propagation, possibly resulting in main rotor  hub failure and consequent loss of the helicopter’.

At the time, Eurocopter said the £2.5 million EC135s had ‘an excellent safety record’. Police Scotland’s aircraft – its only helicopter – was a later T2 version of the original EC135. It was leased from Bond Air Services.
