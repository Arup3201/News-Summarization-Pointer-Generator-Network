Campaign: Demi Bowers wants the law to change to give victims better protection from their sexual attackers

A teenager who has been forced to move out of her family home because a paedophile who molested her lives across the road is calling for a change in the law.

Demi Bowers, 18, said it's 'disgusting and appalling' that her attacker, John Breckon, is permitted to reside so close to her in Bridlington.

As reported in the MailOnline earlier this week, Breckon, 51, was as jailed in 2010 at Hull Crown Court after he admitted sexual activity with a child.

He was released in 2012 after serving half his two-and-a-half-year sentence and was initially banned from Bridlington. However, the restriction ended in February last year.

As he owns the house opposite where Demi lived with her family, he was allowed to resume living there.

Demi recalled on today's This Morning how she was shocked and scared to see him outside his house gardening a year after his release from prison.

'Why only a year? A year doesn't do anything,' she told presenters Rochelle and Marvin Humes.

As a result, she is now campaigning for the law to be changed with a change.org petition called 'Demi's Law' which has currently gained 390 signatures.

The teenager said it's unfair that victims like her seem to have less rights than their attackers.

She said: 'What I am asking is pretty small - just 
for zones to be out in place for a longer period. How are you supposed 
to re-build your life? Not everyone has to have them living across the 
road but it's still a life sentence, no one should have to live with 
this.'

Demi explained on the ITV show how her ordeal began when she started babysitting for John and his wife when she was 13.

She explained: 'Before I met John I had a loving family home, school life was good, everything was just normal. I wasn't very outgoing, I was very family orientated.

'He was left the house opposite ours when his mother died. He and his wife were doing it up so they could move in and I would help babysitting his little girl. I would look after her after school and in the holidays.'

Demi said she loved babysitting the little girl and refused to be paid for it by John and his wife. So she didn't think anything of it when John began lavishing her with expensive gifts.

She thought it was his way of repaying her for babysitting but now she realises he had been grooming her.

After enduring sexual abuse at his hands, she eventually found the courage to tell a teacher what was happening and Breckon was jailed.

But now he is a free man again, Demi feels too scared to live near him in her family home.

As a result, she has moved away with her partner, Natalia Bowers, 25.

Demi said: 'We hit a brick wall, no-one was prepared to do anything. They said it's his home, he can go where he wants.'

Demi wept on This Morning when she viewed a video interview of her mother, Angela Kingston, who explained how the family had been torn apart thanks to Breckon living across the street.

Action: The change.org petition Demi and her family have started calling for a change to the law

Angela said: 'We decided to move here because Bridlington is a small town with a close-knit community.

'We thought it would be a safe place to bring Demi and our children up. We never thought we would be living this nightmare.'

She added: 'Every day I think about what I would like to do to my daughter's attacker, they are very disturbing thoughts but what gets me through is the welfare of my children.

'I miss Demi every single day. She's missing out on her siblings growing up. I feel guilty that Demi isn't part of that and that's the most difficult thing.'
