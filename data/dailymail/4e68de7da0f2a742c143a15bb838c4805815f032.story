Early humans were using toothpicks almost 1.8million years ago, scientists have discovered.

Researchers found that gum disease among hominids, whose remains were found in a region of southern Georgia, was caused by what is thought to have been a basic form of toothpick.

They say that their findings shed some light on why the mandibles, or jaws, of the primitive humans were so varied in shape.

Although they had previously used the hominid teeth to discern what individuals ate and their age, this is the first time that they have been able to offer an explanation for the differences in hominid teeth.

They studied the remains because they believed that the wear and malformations couldn't be caused by genetics.

Some scientists had previously believed that the differences were caused by variations between sexes while others thought they might have been indicative of different species.

Ani Margvelashvili, from the University of Zurich, told the BBC: 'Progressive tooth wear triggers bone remodelling processes that substantially modify the shape of the jaw during an individual's lifetime.'

Ms Margvelashvili added that the group had found a small lesion between the teeth and the gums of one of the jaws examined.

'The
individual who was using a toothpick was young, as his or her teeth 
were not worn down. There was a small cylinder-shaped lesion - in this 
area, if you place a toothpick it goes through.'

One of the jaws examined had lost all of his or her teeth except for one canine.

It is thought he or she was able to survive by using tools to mash up food.

The study was carried out on well preserved remains found at Dmanisi between 1991 and 2005.

The bones belong to the earliest proto-humans known to exist outside of Africa.

Dmanisi hominids had slightly smaller brains that us, walked upright and used tools. They were initially thought to be a separate species of Homo but are now referred to as Homo erectus georgicus.

The remains were discovered by David Lordkipanidze in 1991.

But the crude early dentistry actually made their teeth fall out and is believed to be the first example of over-zealous brushing
