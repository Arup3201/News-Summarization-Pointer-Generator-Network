With rolling green fields stretching as far as the eye can see and stunning sunsets that wouldn't look out of place in the Caribbean, the views from Upton Fold Farm could be mistaken for something from a picture postcard.

Set in 4.5 acres of land, the Cheshire farm boasts incredible views over seven different counties with Liverpool Cathedral visible on the distant horizon.

And what is arguably Britain's finest view could be yours - Upton Fold Farm has been put on the market for £1.2million.

The four bedroom home was a derelict ruin 12 years ago, but now boasts four bathrooms, two reception rooms, a huge kitchen and its own two bedroom barn which is run as a holiday let.

What a view: Upton Fold Farm in Cheshire has been put on the market for £1.2million. The immediate countryside is Cheshire and Jodrell bank in this picture with part of Lancashire also visible

Stunning: The impressive house was a derelict wreck 12 years ago, but its current owners completely restored it

Room with a view: Sat on top of a hill, the home may be somewhat exposed to the elements, but views like this one from one of the bedroom windows more than makes up for that

Vast views: An aerial view shows the panorama of views that the new owner of Upton Fold Farm will enjoy

But its main selling point is the magnificent view afforded by its position perched on the top of a hill near Macclesfield, more than 900ft above sea level.

It's current owners, marketing consultant Miranda Rijks and her husband Harmen, described looking out of the window as like seeing a Caribbean sunset in Cheshire.

Mrs Rijks: 'It is absolutely extraordinary, there is nowhere I would rather be in the world than here when the sun is shining.

'We'll be sorry to leave as when we bought the property it was derelict and we have put our heart and soul into it but we are having to move back south for family and business reasons.

'It needs another family who can enjoy it as much as we have.'

Red sky at night: The owners of the farmhouse say that they are regularly treated to spectacular sunsets. The hills surrounding Peckforton Castle in Cheshire are just visible to the left

Colourful: Warrington estuary is usually visible depending on the light in this view, with Liverpool Cathedral just off to the right

Like being abroad: The home's current owner, marketing consultant Miranda Rijks, said looking out of the window was like seeing a Caribbean sunset in Cheshire. Bosley Cloud between Cheshire and Staffordshire is visible to the left of this shot

One new owner required: Mrs Rijks said that she hopes another family can enjoy the view and the sunsets as much as her and her husband have

On a clear day, the Rijks can see Cheshire, Staffordshire, Derbyshire, North Wales, Shropshire, Lancashire, Greater Manchester, the peaks of Snowdonia, the Malvern Hills, the sea estuary at Ellesmere Port, Liverpool cathedral on the horizon and the hills north of Clitheroe.

The house is on the market for £1.2 million with Savills' Wilmslow office.

Mark Holden, managing the sale, said: 'The property sits in an impressive elevated position, affording the most incredible views over rolling countryside, which creates a wonderful sense of space.

'You're certainly exposed to the elements, providing a dramatic outlook in both summer and winter months.

'The house has a fantastic live in kitchen with vaulted ceiling, which is the perfect place for the family to congregate, there's also a separate barn with letting accommodation providing income potential.'

Winter wonderland: A stunning view of the Cheshire hills covered in snow which shows that even in a bleak winter, living in such a remote location in worth it. This shot is looking across the hills towards Manchester

Airy: Sitting 900ft above sea level on top of a hill, Upton Fold Farm's living space lets in plenty of natural light

Room to entertain: The four-bedroom home boasts a huge kitchen area complete with its own island of worktops

Picturesque wake up call: The new owner of Upton Fold Farm will enjoy waking up to unrivaled views of the British countryside

Home sweet home: The house boasts, four bedrooms, four bathrooms, and a two-bedroom converted stable which is currently used as a holiday let
