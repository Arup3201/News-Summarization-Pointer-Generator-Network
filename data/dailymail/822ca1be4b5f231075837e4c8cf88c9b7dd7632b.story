Caught out: Warrant Officer William Donaldson, 43, stole military equipment from his RAF base and sold it on eBay with his wife Melanie

A Royal Air Force serviceman who stole life-saving military equipment before selling it on internet auction site eBay has been jailed.

Warrant Officer William Donaldson took more than £15,000 pounds worth of tourniquets - most often used to reduce blood loss of soldiers involved in bomb blasts - from stores at the base where he served.

The 43-year-old, who has toured the world with the RAF, would then sell the equipment on the mass auction website for discounted prices with the help of his wife, Melanie.

Today WO Donaldson was described as a 'thoroughly dishonest man' before being sentenced to 15 months in prison.

But, unrepentantly, as he was led to the cells he turned to an MoD investigator and shouted: 'Are you happy now?'

In total the couple, who have two children, aged 12 and eight years, made just short of £10,000 after selling 925 of the items over a three-year period.

The combat action tourniquets are used by battlefield medics in war zones to tie up extremities where limbs have been badly damaged or lost.

The equipment is one of the first items applied in emergencies and helps keep injured personnel alive as they are evacuated to field hospitals or surgical stations.

The court heard WO Donaldson, who had been in the RAF since the age of 17, would use his position and rank at RAF Halton, in Aylesbury, Buckinghamshire, to take the items from the equipment store room.

His wife, who had retired from the RAF after the pair married and is now a dental nurse, would store the items at their military-owned accommodation in the married quarters of the base, before selling them on the internet.

WO Donaldson was sentenced at Aylesbury Crown Court to 15 months in prison after being found guilty of theft and converting criminal property between November 2008 and May 2011.

His wife, 40, was jailed for seven months after being found guilty of converting criminal property by a jury at their trial in July.

Judge Francis Sheridan, in sentencing the pair, said: 'For the last time you will be addressed as Warrant Officer Donaldson, as it is inevitable you will lose this position because you cannot be trusted.

'The RAF is an honourable service and depends on honour from servicemen. What they didn’t get from you was honour.

'You stole and preyed on the fact that the whole operation relied on trust.

'The items you stole operate to protect the armed forces when they are oversees defending our country.

'Mrs Donaldson, your role was to store the items in the home and then match and dispatch on ebay for the profit of both of you.

'You, Mr Donaldson, were a thoroughly dishonest man.

'You
were deployed across the world in service to your country and up until 
you were exposed as a thief you were highly respected.

'It was a stellar downfall. You were fully responsible for this and the downfall of your wife.

'Both
of you decided on a thoroughly dishonest life, the consequences of 
which hasn’t just impacted on you but your jobs, home and family.

'Mrs Donaldson, you served with the RAF up until you married, when you retired.

'You were living in RAF accommodation and you were using this accommodation to store the items before selling.

'During this case the trail of paperwork at the MoD was criticised and it was far from perfect. But when the request goes in to deploy the equipment, it goes immediately and the paperwork catches up.'

Whilst being led from the dock into the holding cells, greying WO Donaldson turned to the investigating officer in the case, Detective Sergeant James Marrs, of the Ministry of Defence Police, and made his outburst.

He and his dark-haired wife had shown no emotion during the sentencing hearing.

After the hearing Detective Sergeant Marrs said: 'The MoD police takes a robust approach to any theft from the Defence estate which has the potential to harm the effectiveness of our Armed Forces.

'We are particularly pleased with the successful convictions of these offenders as the tourniquets they stole are vital battlefield medical supplies.

'The Donaldson’s deceit did not stop these supplies from getting through to the frontline but nonetheless they stole these items without any thought for the effect they might have.

'Most military equipment is specifically designed for their use and we will seek to prosecute any suspects whose actions deprive them of it.

'Buyers of such items also need to be aware. There is a thriving market in military goods but it is their responsibility to check that the items they are buying are being sold legally.'
