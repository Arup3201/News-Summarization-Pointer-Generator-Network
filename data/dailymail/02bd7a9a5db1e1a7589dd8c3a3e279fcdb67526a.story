China and Russia are considering building a high-speed rail line thousands of kilometres from Moscow to Beijing that would cut the journey time from six days on the Trans-Siberian to two.

The project would cost more than $230bn (£144bn) and be over 7,000km (4,350 miles) long - more than three times the world's current longest high-speed line, from the Chinese capital to the southern city of Guangzhou.

The railway would be a powerful physical symbol of the ties that bind Moscow and Beijing, whose political relationship has roots dating from the Soviet era and who often vote together on the UN Security Council.

The £144bn construction would mean trains wouldn't have to travel through Mongolian capital Ulan Bator

There are various routes along the Trans-Siberian railway that link Russia with the Far East

They have strengthened their relationship as Western criticism of Russian President Vladimir Putin mounts over Ukraine and other issues.

The two signed a memorandum of understanding earlier this week during Premier Li Keqiang's visit to Moscow in which Beijing expressed interest in building a fast rail link between the Russian capital and Kazan in the oil-rich Tatarstan region, state broadcaster China Central Television reported.

The 803-kilometre line would be the first stage of the route to Beijing, CCTV said.

At present, trains between the two run along the Trans-Siberian railway that links Moscow and Vladivostok, before switching to a branch line heading south through the Mongolian capital Ulan Bator.

As well as cutting journey time between Moscow and Beijing, the service would miss out remote locations

Relations between China and Russia are strong, so a new rail link is very much a possibility

Direct passenger trains between Beijing and Moscow went into operation in 1954 and there are still two services per week, CCTV said.

The new link would cut the train travel time from six days at present to under two days, the Beijing Times quoted Wang Mengshu, a tunnel and railway expert at the Chinese Academy of Engineering, as saying.

'If the funds are raised smoothly... the line can be completed in five years at the quickest,' he added.

The paper cited a research report that put the cost of one kilometre of Chinese-built fast rail at $33 million.

The country has the world's largest high-speed rail network, built from scratch in less than a decade, relying on technology transfer from foreign companies, including France's Alstom, Germany's Siemens and Japan's Kawasaki Heavy Industries.

Its reputation was tarnished after a bullet train collision in July 2011 near the eastern city of Wenzhou that killed at least 40 people and injured hundreds.

But China is now keen to promote the export of its technology, and has been building high-speed rail networks in Turkey and Venezuela. 

The Tran-Siberia route is an important one for trade as well as commercial

There is no train which is named the trans-Siberian Express. The Moscow-Vladivostok route is served by the Rossiya, whereas Moscow-Beijing routes are usually achieved by using a combination of sectors on different trains. 

All of the routes are working trains and travellers journey with locals, according to Trans-siberian.co.uk. 

At 9,216km (Moscow-Vladivostok) it is the longest direct rail route in the world, and entirely within Russia. The Moscow-Beijing route is shorter, at 9,001km. 

The original Trans-Siberian railway was built from Moscow to Vladivostok on the orders of Tsar Alexander III.

Despite the appeal of following the original route, in practice most people are dissuaded from Vladivostok by three factors: poor availability of onward connections to Asia or return flights to Europe; the greater tourism possibilities of Beijing (pop 15m) compared to Vladivostok (pop 600,000); missing the chance to visit Mongolia en-route.

The route more favoured today is from Moscow to Beijing on the historic Manchurian route and takes a week.

The alternative Trans-Mongolian route via Ulan Bator to Beijing saves 16 hours (and 1,136km). 

The route to Vladivostok was built between 1891 and 1916. The 'first rivet' was ceremonially hammered home by the future Nicholas II, the last Tsar. Under Communist rule he would later be taken to House Arrest as a prisoner on board the Trans-Siberian. 

The journey spans eight time zones.

The Trans-Siberian is longer than the Great Wall of China and US Route 66. 

Since Russia and Mongolia use broad gauge railways while China uses the standard gauge, there is a break-of-gauge, meaning that carriages to or from China cannot simply cross the border, and each carriage has to be lifted in turn to have its bogies changed. The whole operation, combined with passport and customs control, can take several hours.
