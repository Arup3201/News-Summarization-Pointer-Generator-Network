Dutch soldiers are responsible for the massacre of 300 Muslims at Srebrenica in the 1995 Bosnian war and must pay their families compensation, a court has ruled.

Peacekeepers from the Netherlands who were meant to be guarding the town turned away the victims from their compound in the village of Potocari during the bloody conflict and handed them over to Bosnian Serb forces.

They were then killed by the Bosnian Serb army led by General Ratko Mladic - who is himself on trial for war crimes.

This week a district court at The Hague decided that members of the Dutchbat force could have known the refugees would be massacred if they did not help them - and were therefore liable for their deaths.

The court ruled that the
 Dutch peacekeeping troops could have protected the 300-plus men and 
boys who were among thousands of Muslims - mainly women, children and 
elderly people - taking shelter in a Dutch compound inside the 
UN-declared safe haven of Srebrenica.

The troops - part of a Dutch UN battalion known as Dutchbat - handed over those in the compound two days after the town fell.

The
 Bosnian Serb troops then killed the Muslim men and boys, who 'would 
have survived if Dutchbat had acted properly,' said Presiding Judge 
Larissa Alwin.

In total 8,000 were killed at Srebrenica, although the court cleared the Dutch of responsibility for the other 7,700 deaths.

The
 court said the Netherlands was not liable for the deaths of those who 
had fled into the forests surrounding Srebrenica, where many of the men 
and boys were later buried in mass graves.

Although those people had protection in the UN safe haven they were never directly in the custody of the Dutch troops, the court ruled.

'Dutchbat cannot be held liable for their fate,' the ruling read.

In
 an emotionally-charged hearing attended by a handful of victims' 
relatives, the judge said the peacekeepers should have known that the 
men taken from the compound would be slain because there was already 
evidence of the Serbs committing war crimes.

'By co-operating in the deportation of these men, Dutchbat acted unlawfully,' Judge Alwin said.

The ruling could set a precedent with implications for future peacekeeping deployments by the Netherlands or other countries.

It could be appealed, however, meaning it is unlikely to resolve 
the Dutch national trauma over the country's role in the worst massacre 
on European soil since the Second World War.

During the 
Bosnian war, the Dutch battalion Dutchbat had been deployed to protect 
Srebrenica, which had been designated a safe haven by the United 
Nations.

But on
 July 13, 1995, the peacekeepers bowed to pressure from Bosnian Serb 
forces commanded by General Mladic and forced thousands of Muslim 
families out of their fenced-off compound.

The Bosnian Serb forces 
sorted the Muslims by gender, then drove the males away and began 
killing them in what would become the bloody climax to the 1992-95 
Bosnian war, a slaughter that international courts have ruled was 
genocide.

The war claimed 100,000 lives in all, and was the bloodiest of a series of conflicts that accompanied the break-up of Yugoslavia in the 1990s.

The Srebrenica bodies
 were piled into hastily-made mass graves, which were later bulldozed 
and scattered among other burial sites in an attempt to hide the 
evidence.

The
 case was brought by the Mothers of Srebrenica, a group representing 
surviving relatives of the victims. They had failed in their bid to have
 a court find the United Nations responsible for the massacre.

'At
 the moment that the men were sent away, Dutchbat knew or should have 
known that the genocide was taking place and therefore there was a 
serious risk that those men would be killed,' said judge Peter Blok.

The
 failure of Dutch soldiers to protect the Muslim men and boys of 
Srebrenica had deep repercussions, contributing to the resignation of 
the Dutch government in 2002.

Relatives of the dead welcomed the limited finding of liability but lamented that it did not go further.

'Obviously
 the court has no sense of justice,' said Munira Subasic, president of 
Mothers of Srebrenica.

'How is it 
possible to divide victims, and tell one mother that the Dutch state is 
responsible for the death of her son on one side of the wire and not for
 the son on the other side?'

The court did not say how much compensation the families should receive, and the figure will be worked out between lawyers and the Dutch government once any appeals have run their course.

A lawyer for the relatives, Marco Gerritsen, said he would study the 89-page ruling before deciding whether to appeal.

It remains to be seen what effect the ruling will have on UN recruitment for peacekeeping missions.

Dutch Defence
 Ministry spokesman Klaas Meijder said the Dutch government began 
insisting on stricter safeguards for its troops involved in UN missions 
after the Srebrenica massacre, but would not speculate on whether 
Wednesday's ruling would have a further impact.

'What this means for future missions, I can't say,' he said.
