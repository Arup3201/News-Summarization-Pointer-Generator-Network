If you're planning to slip into a slinky frock for your Christmas party but your gym regime has been neglected, one company thinks it has the answer.

Figgahugga, a new British brand, has unveiled a range of dresses that offer your body a '360 degree hug' and make you look slimmer in the process.

While the new brand is far from being the only shapewear on the market, unlike Spanx, brightly-coloured Figgahuggas are designed to be seen.

Festival wear: As well as smoothing your shape, the garments have a silicone hem - perfect for clubbing

As a result, the £49.99 garments only come in vibrant colours, among them neon green, bright pink and electric blue.

Each
dress in the range is constructed with a seamed 'secret support' lining, 
which works like a corset, helping to shape your figure, define your waist and create a 
smooth silhouette - all while keeping you cool and dry. 

The colourful garments, which come in four different sizes, are made from a comfortable mix of nylon and lycra.

Although the cheerful hues might not be to everyone's taste, they do, say the company, double as festival attire thanks to the silicone hem that promises to stop 
the dress riding up when dancing. 

Before and after: The dresses give a 360 degree 'hug' and flatten your tummy, while concealing VPL

Difference: Unlike Spanx and other brands, the Figgahugga is designed to be seen underneath clothes

Figure-hugging: Available in sizes 8-22, these creations by M&S are intended to offer a day-to-night solution

Flattering: Kimberley Walsh and Kym Lomax are big fans of Body Frocks, which enhance the female figure

Slimming: Body Frock dresses, which start at £155, should fit like a corset according to the makers

Thrifty:  Gok Wan has also created a range of slimming dresses, £35 each, for at TU for Sainsbury's
