A U.S. firefighter has battled osteoarthritis and four hip replacements to break the world paddleboarding record.

Robyn Benincasa, 47, paddled non-stop for 90 miles around California's Huntington Beach Harbour.

The athlete, from Cardiff by the Sea, California, spent 24 hours standing on a surf board while struggling against the pain of her artificial hip.

'I did this for all of the amazing women I know who are recovering from medical setbacks. I want to show what's possible when you choose not to focus on what you've lost, but on being the best of what you are today,' Mrs Benincasa said.

Cheered on by husband Jeff, 49, the firefighter has been officially recognized by Guinness World Records for completing the greatest distance on a stand up paddleboard in 24 hours.

A lifelong triathlon competitor and adventure racer, Mrs Benincasa suffered a devastating setback when she was diagnosed with severe osteoarthritis in 2007.

The degenerative joint disease, which usually affects women over 50, forced Mrs Benincasa to give up on racing altogether.

But after four hip replacements in just five years, the record-breaker took on paddleboarding as a new test of her endurance.

'I find the best thing to do is look at what you still can do, instead of what you can't. I can't run very far anymore because of my condition, but that lead to me to something I love even more - the sport of paddling,' Mrs Benincasa said.

She spent eight weeks training for her attempt, completing 10-hour non-stop paddles around the California harbour.

But even the best training couldn't prepare Mrs Benincasa for her artificial hips giving out.

Mrs Benincasa said: 'In the middle of the night I did have a moment of crisis. I couldn't keep my balance on the board and worried the muscles supporting my hip replacements weren't up for the job.'

Luckily, after a brief inspection, the firefighter found the rudder on her paddleboard had broken.

Her artificial hips were holding strong and after a quick fix she was on her way.

Husband Jeff said: 'I've never known anyone as mentally tough as Robyn, when she decides to do something, no matter how difficult; you know it's going to happen!'

The firefighter hopes to break more paddleboard records and has also created Project Athena, a non-profit foundation helping women with serious health issues take on physical challenges.

'It's the best feeling to help survivors of health setbacks live out their dreams of physical adventure. My friends think I'm crazy, but quitting is not an option!'
