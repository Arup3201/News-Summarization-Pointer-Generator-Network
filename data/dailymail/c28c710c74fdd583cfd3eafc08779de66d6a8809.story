A grandfather has been swept out to sea while scattering the ashes of his dead sister.

Shane Galliers, 51, met relatives to say a last goodbye to his sister, Michelle Galliers, who died in November.

After waiting for the tide to go out, each scattered some of her ashes on the beach near Tintagel on the north Cornwall coast. But Mr Galliers walked away to say a private farewell.

The search for Shane Galliers (left) who was swept out to sea, has been called off. The 51-year-old was scattering the ashes of his sister, Michelle Galliers (right) when he was dragged out to sea 

As he stood at the water’s edge on Saturday at 5pm, a large wave hit the father of one and he slipped down a bank into the water.

A relative went to help him, and was swept out to sea himself before making it back. But Mr Galliers, a grandfather of four from Launceston, disappeared.

After rescue efforts were called off yesterday, his mother, Patricia Howells, spoke of her devastation at losing another child.

She said: ‘The family were all meeting at Trebarwith Strand. The sea was very rough.

‘In the end we decided it would be safer to go up to a little river on the beach and do it there.

‘Michelle wanted her ashes scattered on the beach as that’s where her grandmother and uncle are. It was where she grew up. Each member of the family had their own pot of ashes. Shane decided he wanted to go the other side of the river.

Officials described conditions at the beach near Tintagel, Cornwall, as 'treacherous' and 'chaotic' when Mr Galliers was struck by a large wave and dragged into the sea

The grandfather-of-four's brother-in-law tried to save him from the strong waves but was overpowered by the current, his relatives said today

‘I think he wanted some space to have one last chat with his sister. We didn’t even know he was there. The first we knew about it was when someone shouted, “There’s someone in the water”. 

'We didn’t think it could be any of our group as we were all together, but then we realised it was Shane.

‘His sister’s husband tried to reach him but he ended up slipping in too. Luckily the tide dragged him the other way and he was able to get out.

‘Unfortunately, Shane couldn’t stay afloat. It was so cold, we were very well wrapped up. He was wearing very thick clothes. They just dragged him down.

‘It’s all a very big shock. First I lost my daughter and now I have lost my son, it’s so difficult to come to terms with.’

Yesterday, a spokesman for the Maritime & Coastguard Agency said: ‘The search for the man who was washed into the sea, co-ordinated by Falmouth Coastguard, has finished. Sadly, no sign has been found of him.’

Trebarwith Strand has long been a special place for the family with many relatives' ashes scattered there  

Officials were called to the scene yesterday afternoon and undertook an extensive search of its waters
