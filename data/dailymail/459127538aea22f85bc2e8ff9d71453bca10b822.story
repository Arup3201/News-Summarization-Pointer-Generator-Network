Barcelona defender Jeremy Mathieu has been ruled out for up to three weeks with a leg injury.

The former Valencia man will now miss Barca's Champions League clash with Ajax as well as their trip to Almeria.

The French international picked up the injury to his right leg during the 1-0 loss to Celta Vigo at the Nou Camp.

Luis Suarez made his home debut in the defeat but despite another encouraging performance he couldn't prevent Luis Enrique's side losing their second consecutive match. 

The result saw them slip from the top of the table after both Real and Atletico Madrid registered wins to move above the Catalan club.

The news will come as a bitter blow to Barcelona boss Enrique who is also without summer signing Thomas Vermaelen.

The former Arsenal man is yet to play for his new club and Enrique admitted last week Vermaelen's recovery 'is not going as we'd hoped.'
