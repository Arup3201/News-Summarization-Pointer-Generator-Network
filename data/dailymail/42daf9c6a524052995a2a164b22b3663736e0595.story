Alan Watkins challenged police to catch him - and they did

A violent thug who taunted police while he was on the run has now been arrested and returned to prison.

Alan Watkins, 24, who was on license after being jailed for an assault, poked fun on Facebook at Gwent Police's attempts to catch him.

He wrote 'Catch me if you can' and posted photos of himself appearing to urinate on police car.

However, he was finally arrested for breaching his licence conditions.

A Gwent Police spokesman said: 'Twenty
four year old Alan Watkins who had breached his licence conditions 
after being released from prison has been arrested and will be returned 
to prison custody.'

He 
began taunting officers after an urgent appeal for information as to his
whereabouts was posted on Gwent Police's Facebook page.

Watkins
even shared the appeal on his own page, boasting: 'Wow, I'm on the 
Gwent police site. You catch me if you can - do your f****** job'.

He was released from jail last May, 
half way through a seven month sentence for assault, but has since 
breached his licence conditions.

Over a 24 hour period he continued to mock officers, posting: 'Catching me is like keeping up with Usain Bolt, impossible.'

Not laughing any more: After hours spent taunting police and telling them to do their job and find him, they did

He added: 'Well what should I do today, hand myself in or enjoy my freedom a little longer.

'Freedom... prison... freedom... prison... freedom or prison? That is the question.'

As friends told him to hand himself in, he wrote: 'I think I might as well live my freedom before it gets taken away.'

One friend joked: 'Ha ha, you can run but you can't hide.

Alan proudly posted pictures of himself apparently urinating on a police car and holding what appeared to be a suspicious-looking cigarette as his friends on Facebook warned him he would get caught by Gwent Police

'They found you once and they'll find you again.'

Another friend added: 'Police banging my door yesterday looking for you, I'm not happy about it.'

As well as his mocking posts, Watkins has also posted a picture of himself apparently urinating on a police car.

His account says that he is a plasterer from Newport, in South Wales, but lists his current location as 'on the naughty step'.

Alan appeared to debate whether or not to enjoy freedom a little longer or head back to prison on his Facebook wall

Watkins had put his own 'wanted' poster on Facebook and taunted police saying: 'Catch me if you can'
