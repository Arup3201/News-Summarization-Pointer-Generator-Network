Witness: The trainer and the tiger were videoed from outside the ring by an onlooker

This picture is believed to show the trainer Alexander Crispin 'Suarez', who was killed by a tiger during a performance of Circus Suarez in the city of Hermosillo, Mexico

Mexican news agency Notimex reported Mr Crispin suffered neck injuries from bites and scratches on Saturday.

He was taken by ambulance to the Red Cross 
hospital Huatabampo, Sonora where he died while receiving medical care, 
as a result of hypovolemic shock.

The video shows spectators fleeing the circus tent as two workers beat the tiger to free Mr Crispin, who was pinned to the ground.

It is presumed that the Bengal Tiger was
killed by one of the companions of the trainer during the struggle to 
try to save the trainer's life.

The owner of Circo Suarez was 
yesterday called to testify at the Public Ministry in the town of 
Etchojoa, where the attack occurred.

Valente
Malon, who local media says is the owner of the circus currently set up
in the town's Plaza Indigena, was summoned by officials.

In the wild, Bengal tigers live alone 
and aggressively scent-mark large territories to keep their rivals away -
but rarely attack humans.

The most famous of these occurred in October 2003 when Roy Horn, of 
the famous Siegfried & Roy Las Vegas show, was attacked by a seven-year-old white tiger named Montecore during one of the duo's 
performances.

Horn was in critical condition for several weeks after he suffered massive blood loss and a stroke, but eventually recovered.

The Suarez Brothers Circus is described as a traditional and successful act that tours Latin America. It was founded in 1853 by Miguel Suarez

Tiger tamers have been part of the performance at the circus for many years, as this leaflet shows

In their natural habitat Bengal tigers are powerful nocturnal hunters that travel many miles to find buffalo, deer, wild pigs, and other large mammals.

The tigers use their distinctive coats as camouflage and lie in wait and creep close enough to attack their victims with a quick spring and a fatal pounce.

A hungry tiger can eat as much as 60lbs in one night, though they usually eat less.
Despite their fearsome reputation, most tigers avoid humans however, a few do become dangerous maneaters.

These animals are often sick and unable to hunt normally, or live in an area where their traditional prey has vanished.
Females give birth to litters of two to six cubs, which they raise with little or no help from the male.

Cubs cannot hunt until they are 18 months old and remain with their mothers for two to three years, when they disperse to find their own territory.
