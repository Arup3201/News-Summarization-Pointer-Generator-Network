Police have discovered human skeletal remains while searching for two missing women near where a third woman went missing three years ago.

The bones were found near Myrtle Beach in Horry County, South Carolina as the search for missing women Heather Elvis, 20, and Jamie Lynn Cross, 24, intensified on Saturday.

Brittanee Drexel, 17, was last seen four years ago just 25 miles from where the remains were found.

While authorities were still unclear as to whether the bones belonged to a male or female, they had been in the thick woodlands for some time.

Ms Elvis, from Myrtle Beach, was last heard from on December 18 at 3am after she went on a date, her family said. Her abandoned car was found the next day at a boat landing spot in Horry County.

The latest discovery comes as the reward for information on the missing young woman was increased to $20,000.

Her father, Terry Elvis, told FoxNews.com: ‘To not hear from her for more than 24 hours is way out of character.’

Despite efforts by Horry County Police and members of the community to find Ms Elvis, she remains gone without a trace. 

Five
 days after Ms Elvis’ disappearance, Ms Cross of Myrtle Beach was 
reported missing after she was last seen leaving her house in a green 
Volvo on December 23 at about 5pm.

Authorities said that there is no indication to suggest the two disappearances are linked.

Miss
 Drexel, a high school junior from Rochester, New York was last seen in 
April 2009 leaving a popular Myrtle Beach hotel along Ocean Boulevard.

She had traveled to South Carolina with 
friends but without her mother's permission and a camera at the Bluwater
 Resort videoed her leaving the hotel on April 25th, at close to 9 p.m.

After sneaking away with friends on a
 Spring Break holiday, Miss Drexel left a group of male friends from the
 Blue Water Resort to walk back to the Bar Harbor Hotel, where she was 
staying with other girlfriends.

The pretty blonde texted her boyfriend on the walk to the hotel, but security footage confirmed that she never made it inside.

The
 police in Myrtle Beach have said they believe that Miss Drexel was 
abducted as she walked the one-mile stretch of Ocean Boulevard that lies
 between the two hotels and is most likely dead.

Without a trace: Ms Cross was last seen leaving her house in Myrtle Beach on December 23. Police say there is no indication that the two recent disappearances are linked

Last seen: Brittanee was shown on the security footage of the Blue Water Resort in Myrtle Beach as she left the room of a group of her male friends and headed to the nearby hotel where she and some girlfriends were staying back in 2009
