Lurid details have emerged of the sexual antics of university hockey players at a controversial championship party - which includes students having sex in the penalty box.

The debauched details emerged after Boston University released a report on the 'culture of sexual entitlement' by its hockey players.

Many of the details of the 
investigation - which includes tales of sexual debauchery - were only 
revealed in confidential subcommittee reports.

However,
these documents - which have been reported by the Boston Globe - paint a
worrying picture of the attitude of some of the university's hockey 
players towards sex.

The report contained details of a late-night championship party in 2009 at the Agganis Arena which revealed that:

Details of the party have now only emerged after a task force was launched in February when two Boston University hockey players were charged with sexual assault.

The investigation by the task force found that some hockey players - when surrounded by fans - had 'the perception that they need not seek consent for sexual contact.'

One player told investigators: 'You don’t ask [permission for sex] when you are drunk.'

The task force was told by one female
student that a hockey player had put his hands down her pants at a 
party and, despite the fact that she was punching him, refused to stop.

When asked why she had not reported the incident to authorities, she replied: 'that’s just what [BU hockey players] do.'

The reports also found that some hockey players at the university boast about their sexual exploits on Facebook, often referring to conquests as 'kills'.

Many of the hockey players, the investigation found, regularly engage in group sex.

The university campus police and administrators did not find out about the controversial 2009 party until this year once the task force investigation started.

Party goers were having sex in the penalty box, drank from beer kegs in the locker room showers and took to the ice naked to shoot ice pucks. Players also put on Facebook their female conquests

It has emerged that during interviews with investigators hockey coach Jack Parker said at first that he did not know about the party. However, he later acknowledged that he knew some of the men had been drinking in the locker room.

Despite this, two players and a member of staff said that within a few days of the party, the coach had reprimanded the team for its behaviour.

The subcommittee report also found that some of the hockey players are less academically gifted than the vast majority of their classmates.

One professor described how six hockey players intimidated their classmates and answered their mobile phones during lectures.  Eventually all six of the players dropped out of the class. However, another professor said hockey players were respectful and prepared.

Following a recommendation by the task force, Parker has been stripped of the title of executive athletic director. He still keeps another title.

However, he will still continue as coach and will earn the same salary.

The public report has made 14 recommendations, which the university intends to implement.
