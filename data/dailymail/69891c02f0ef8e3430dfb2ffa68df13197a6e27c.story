You've probably noticed an  influx of hot dog legs, beach feet and dreamy sunsets on your Facebook, Instagram and Twitter feeds over the course of summer.

Now one French beach is looking to put a stop to this with a ban on beach selfies.

A section of The Garoupe, a popular beach in Southern France, is cracking down on people constantly boasting about their holidays to friends back at home by working with mobile network, Three, to create designated 'No Braggies Zones'.

A spokesperson for the beach said: 'The Garoupe beaches are among the most glamorous and pristine beaches in all of France and we want people to be able to enjoy our exclusive beach in the moment, not spending the majority of their time bragging to their friends and family back home.'

The 'braggie', similar to the 'selfie', is a word that has firmly wiggled its way into the popular lexicon, and is a term that's been coined to describe the humble brag pictures of people enjoying a fancy cocktail, walking in the sand or gazing at a sunset.

The phenomenon of the 'braggie' arose after it was found that 30 per cent Brits put bragging in their top five holiday activities.

What the mobile network calls Holiday Spam Police will be patrolling the No Braggies Zones looking out for offenders taking sneaky snaps of themselves during the busy holiday period.

Authorities have recognised the need to protect office workers and others not lucky enough to be on holiday from highly immodest beach shots after Three dropped data roaming charges in many popular holiday destinations leading holiday makers to get snap happy without fear of hefty charges.

The Holiday Spam Police's mission aims to shame hot-dog-leg-happy holidaymakers further afield than this renegade beach in France with their 'tag a bragger' campaign.

Making a particular example of celebrities who post large amounts of pictures of themselves, including Kim Kardashian, who has just announced a book of her selfies, people are encouraged to comment using the hashtag #holidayspam when they spot vacation boasting on their social networks.

Tom Malleschitz, marketing director at Three concluded: 'The ban is an extreme measure, but one that we think is needed if we're to motivate people to brag more responsibly abroad and share only the finest photos of their holidays on social media'.
