Caught: Orville 'Moe' Fleming has been captured after more than two weeks on the run

A former California fire battalion chief who eluded authorities for more than two weeks has been arrested in the stabbing death of his girlfriend.

Orville 'Moe' Fleming had been on the run since the body of his fianc√©e, 26-year-old Sarah June Douglas, was found May 1 inside the south Sacramento home they had shared for the past two years.

Authorities say Fleming, 55, had considerable outdoor skills and was familiar with California's mountains because of his career as a wildland firefighter.

On top of that, he had places to hide out as he was believed to have had keys to state fire facilities throughout the state.

He was fired from his job as a battalion chief and instructor with the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection after failing to show up at work for a week after the slaying.

'We are pleased that this search is over and the Sheriff's Office has apprehended Mr. Fleming,' said Daniel Berlant, a spokesman for the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection.

'We will continue to support the sheriff and the district attorney in any way we can as the judicial process continues.'

Investigators previously said Fleming moved in with Douglas after meeting her as an escort who advertised on the Internet.

Fleming filed for divorce from his wife in Fresno County Superior Court in October, according to online records, but the case has not been finalized.

Victim: Sarah June Douglas was found stabbed and strangled in the home she shared with Fleming, who she met on an escort site

Fleming's estranged wife, Meagan Fleming, had sought a protective order against Douglas last fall, alleging his new girlfriend was harassing her and her adult children in an attempt to get money from Orville Fleming.

The request was denied a day later without being considered, when a judge said Meagan Fleming had not properly filled out the required form.

There was no answer at the telephone number listed for Meagan Fleming's home on Friday, and she did not immediately respond to an email.

Orville Fleming vanished after he abandoned his official California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection pickup in a Sacramento suburb before sheriff's investigators learned of Douglas' death.

Investigators received hundreds of tips, including unsubstantiated sightings as distant as Oregon and Los Angeles.

Search: Police have started a state-wide manhunt for Fleming, who is believed to be armed and dangerous

Help: Fleming allegedly reached out to an escort service shortly after the murder of his girlfriend

Veteran: The lone suspect is a 24-year veteran firefighter that has risen to the rank of battalion chief

Earlier reports alleged that Fleming may have used other escorts from the same company that he used to originally hire Douglas when they first met.

Police believe that Fleming, who had been dating Douglas for two years, had continued to use the escort website after her death.

It is though that he picked up someone he had met on the site just moments after Miss Douglas was stabbed, before fleeing.

'We have information 
that [Fleming] has most likely reached out to someone in the community 
of [Redbook],' Sergeant Lisa Bowman told CBS.

Attacked: Sarah Douglas had confided in her sister that she planned to end her relationship with Fleming just hours before she was killed

'If he can commit such a heinous and violent murder in the way that he did, we're concerned for the public.'

Douglas had confided in her mom and sister that her relationship with Fleming was troubled on the night she was murdered.

The former escort called her sister, 
Stephanie, just after midnight on May 1 to say: 'That [SOB] left the gas
 on. I think he's trying to kill my birds.'

She
 was then heard saying: 'Whoa, you scared me' before a man the sister 
later identified as Fleming was heard arguing with her.

Stephanie Douglas said she then heard her sister scream, before the line went dead.
