'Unfounded': Planning minister Greg Clark hit back at the National Trust's Green Belt concerns

The National Trust has become locked in a war of words with a planning minister over the charity's 'risible' claims that Green Belt land will be threatened by Coalition planning reforms.

Conservative MP Greg Clark accused the charity of 'nihilistic selfishness' after the trust dared to voice concerns over 'damaging development in undesignated countryside'.

The planning minister branded the National Trust's claims as 'unfounded' in arguing that new houses are needed to solve the housebuilding 'crisis' and help young people onto the property ladder.

Mr Clarks comments came after the trust revealed its 'grave concerns' over the Coalition's draft National Planning Policy Framework published last month.

The National Trust's Director-General Dame Fiona Reynolds said the proposed changes could 'lead to unchecked and damaging development in the undesignated countryside on a scale not seen since the 1930s'.

She argued that the reforms focused too heavily on stimulating economic growth meaning that far more developments would be approved.

But Mr Clark responded by saying the Government's position had been misrepresented.

He added that those who sought to 'preserve in aspic' their towns were guilty of 'nihilistic selfishness'.

In an interview with the Financial Times, he said: 'The principal campaigning point seems to be the loss of the Green Belt.

'There is nothing in the policy that would lead to a significant loss of Green Belt.

'The National Trust had on their website an aerial shot of Los Angeles in some risible idea that this was the future of Britain.'

Mr Clark insisted that Green Belt, national parks and areas of special scientific interest in this country would remain protected.

Under threat: The National Trust claimed Green Belt areas similar to this one in Chipping Norton, Oxfordshire, could be subject to 'damaging development'

Vision of the future: Mr Clark claimed the National Trust used a picture of urban sprawl in Los Angeles to depict how Britain could look in years to come

The MP added that the only way in which new homes would be built on Green Belt land would be under a new 'community right to build' scheme, allowing small developments of up to 12 homes to be built if supported by 90% of locals.

He added: 'If you can square a village voting for 10 new homes for its parishioners with the sprawl of Beverly Hills or Santa Monica, I fail to see it.'

The proposed streamlining of planning rules surrounding new developments aims to reduce the current 1,300 pages of national planning policy to just 52.

The Council for the Protection of Rural England has also spoken out against the planned changes.

Opposed: The National Trust had voiced 'grave concerns' on their website about the Coalition's draft National Planning Policy Framework

Councils will be told there should be a 'presumption for development' when they write their local planning strategies.

Mr Clark added: 'Last year was the lowest level of housebuilding since World War II, which means the problem is getting worse and worse causing more misery for more people for as long as this isn't addressed.

'People do have an interest in the future - to not care shows a degree of nihilistic selfishness which is quite rare.'

A spokesman for the Department for Communities and Local Government said that the Green Belt will not be threatened by the proposed changes.

'We have made our commitment to the Green Belt crystal clear. It is in the Coalition Agreement, and our proposed abolition of the unpopular regional strategies through the Localism Bill will stop the top-down pressure to remove the Green Belt in 30 areas across England,' said the spokesman.

A National Trust spokesman hit back at the Planning Minister, saying: 'Greg Clark and his colleagues at DCLG seem to think that greenbelts and other designated areas of countryside are all that anyone cares about.

'They are not, as the Government should have realised from the forestry debacle earlier this year. We've not even mentioned them as part of our campaign.

'Our primary concern is what the Government's reforms threaten to do to the everyday places in and around cities, towns and villages that are hugely valued by local communities.

'To say we have a nihilistic view on housing is equally odd. We have developed hundreds of homes ourselves and have existing permission to build hundreds more on land that we own.

'We believe strongly that any development must meet the needs of people, the environment as well as the economy.

'The Government has failed to do this in its reforms. It has put short-term financial gain ahead of everything else.

'It has failed to protect the everyday places that local communities love. It has given the power in planning to the already powerful.

'Whilst the Government is making warm noises about local communities, in practice the dice are heavily loaded to favour development and local people simply won't get enough say.'
