Duck Dynasty patriarch Phil Robertson launched another tirade against the gay community this weekend but saved a few potshots for Democrats.

The reality TV star and evangelical preacher got cheers from a crowd at Alabama's Rock the South music festival on Saturday during a Q&A session with his son Alan.

Dressed his typical camouflage gear, he told fans that his homophobic remarks were really just part of his Christian duty.

According to al.com, Robertson, 68, said: 'I'm actually a nice man. … I'm trying to help those poor souls and turn them to Jesus.'

He also saved some scathing remarks for Democrats.

'Get your tail down and vote and lets vote this ungodly bunch out of Washington,' he said at the end of his speech, as the crowd went wild, the Cullman Times reported.

Robertson's remarks were relatively tame compared to previous public outbursts. In his now infamous interview with GQ in December, Robertson said: 'It seems like, to me, a vagina — as a man — would be more desirable than a man's anus; that's just me. I mean, come on, dudes! ... It's just not logical.'

He also likened homosexuality to bestiality. 

'Everything is blurred on what’s right and what's wrong. Sin becomes fine,' he said in the interview last year. 'Start with homosexual behavior and just morph out from there.

'Bestiality, sleeping around with this woman and that woman and that woman and those men... Neither the adulterers, the idolaters, the male prostitutes, the homosexual offenders, the greedy, the drunkards, the slanderers, the swindlers - they won't inherit the kingdom of God.'

In hot water: Robertson, 68, was briefly suspended from Duck Dynasty last December following an interview

Despite A&E briefly dropping Phil Robertson from the show after the scandal in December, he has not kept quiet about his homophobic views.

Robertson appeared at the Alabama festival alongside music acts Sarah Evans and Lynard Skynard.

Even as the show has slumped in ratings nationally after Phil Robertson's anti-gay comments, the wealthy family behind the Duck Commander brand of game calls has remained influential.
