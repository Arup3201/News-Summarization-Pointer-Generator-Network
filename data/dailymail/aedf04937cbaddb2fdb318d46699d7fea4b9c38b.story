Nigel Farage has dismissed claims that Ukip backs the repatriation of EU migrants who have lived and worked in Britain for years.

He insists the party would allow lawful migrants to stay – even if the UK leaves the European Union.

His intervention follows a storm of protest after Ukip candidate Mark Reckless, who is set to win the party’s second parliamentary seat in the Rochester and Strood by-election tomorrow night, was accused of advocating the repatriation of existing migrants.

Ukip leader Nigel Farage (pictured) has dismissed claims that Ukip backs the repatriation of EU migrants who have lived and worked in Britain for years and insists the party would allow lawful migrants to stay

Labour last night condemned his remarks as an echo of the policies of the British National Party and claimed he had ‘let the mask slip’.

Mr Reckless, who defected from the Tories in September, told an audience of residents on Tuesday that European migrants could remain in Britain on work permits for a ‘fixed period’ – even if they own a home and have children at local schools.

Asked if they could be deported, he did not deny it – but said cases would be looked at ‘sympathetically’ if someone had lived in Britain for years and was well integrated.

However, he hastily backtracked today, insisting that he had meant a tougher immigration system advocated by Ukip would only apply to new migrants, not those already in Britain.

And Mr Farage, whose wife is German, claimed Mr Reckless had made the comments in a ‘minor confusion’ and confirmed that Ukip’s policy was to allow all migrants who already live in Britain lawfully to remain here.

The Ukip leader said: ‘We have never suggested since 2004 that anybody who has come here legally and in good faith should be subject to retrospective legislation...that would be unfair, un-British and wrong.

‘Let me make this clear, during our divorce negotiations, even if the European Union was to behave badly, and was to say, people living in Spain would be threatened with not being there, we would maintain the line that we believe in the rule of law, we believe in British justice, we believe anybody who has come to Britain legally has the right to remain.’

He said Mr Reckless had been fighting a two-month election campaign. ‘This is the first bit of confusion that has been caused,’ Mr Farage added. ‘Apart from confusion over that he has not put a foot wrong.’

Yvette Cooper, the shadow home secretary, condemned Mr Reckless’s comments as ‘nasty’ and said Ukip had ‘let the mask slip’. She said: ‘To hear the language of repatriation coming from someone they hope will be their second MP is shameful.

‘It’s a policy that comes straight out of the last BNP manifesto and does not reflect British values.’

Shadow health secretary Andy Burnham added: ‘This is an extreme agenda. Nearly every British family has got a connection with Europe and immigration… My wife’s Dutch. Is she going back under Mark Reckless’s plan?’

Mr Reckless denied he had been confused, saying he had meant that if Britain leaves the EU ‘anyone here lawfully under freedom of movement rules we would allow to stay’. He said repatriation was ‘not a word I’ve used’ and said some of the Conservative rhetoric about immigration during the campaign had been ‘disgraceful’.

Conservative ministers did not condemn his remarks.

Communities Secretary Eric Pickles, who was campaigning in the area yesterday, said the idea of deporting migrants was ‘wacky’.

However, he said Mr Reckless had previously supported free movement of migrants and this showed he was ‘willing to say anything to get elected.’ Mr Pickles said he was ‘certain’ the Conservatives could win the by-election, although polls have suggested Mr Reckless has a 15 point lead.

The Tory candidate, 36 year-old businesswoman Kelly Tolhurst, used a hustings in the town to appeal to Labour, Liberal Democrat and Green voters to back the Conservatives to keep Ukip out.

Miss Tolhurst said: ‘It’s a two-horse race and the reality of it is if we don’t want to wake up to a Ukip MP on Friday 21st November then people who would normally be voting for Labour, the Lib Dems or anyone else, then they need to be voting for me.’

Two more Conservative MPs are said to have held secret discussions about defecting to Ukip.

Mark Reckless, who defected from the Tories in September, said he had been contacted by two former colleagues during his campaign to win the Rochester and Strood seat today.

Winning the poll would make ‘a number of Tory MPs consider their position’, he claimed.

One Tory MP held a ‘cloak and dagger’ meeting with Mr Reckless to discuss the process of defection in detail, while another has contacted him by phone, he revealed yesterday.

Mr Reckless said: ‘I have spoken with two Conservative MPs about the possibility of their moving over, and I think they will want to see what the result is tonight before making any decisions. It is a very individual decision. And I feed back to Nigel on those conversations.

‘A lot of Conservative MPs will be looking at the result closely. I think it’s about Ukip being able to show we are taking votes from Labour as well as the Conservatives.’

One of those rumoured to be on the verge of quitting the Tories is Peter Bone, the arch Eurosceptic MP for Wellingborough. He is speaking at the Cambridge Union tonight in favour of the motion that ‘Ukip has been good for British politics’. Yesterday Mr Bone said the date of the debate had been fixed months ago and said he wanted Ukip members to ‘come back and join the Conservatives’.

It emerged yesterday that Mr Bone, as well as Tories Philip Hollobone and Martin Vickers are polling their constituents on membership of the EU.

Mr Reckless did the same before defecting in September, as did Douglas Carswell before he changed parties in August.

Tory Communities Minister Eric Pickles downplayed further defections, saying: ‘I don’t think there will be any.

‘We have brought the economy back from the brink.’
