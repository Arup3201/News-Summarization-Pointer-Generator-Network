These salami earrings may look good enough to eat, but they probably won't taste very pleasant.

The realistic pair are part of a range of bizarre, food-themed women's accessories designed by a Japanese online store and made out of very realistic-looking (but completely plastic) foodstuffs.

Among the strange selection is a bacon and eggs-style hairband, a sausage necklace, a pizza necklace and a pair of black olive earrings.

This pair of meaty earrings are part of a range of, er, delicious women's accessories brought out by a Japanese online store

The pizza necklace from Fake Food Hatanaka will set customers back around £75, while a pair of black olive 
earrings cost just over £10.

There is a curious spaghetti carbonara-themed ring that is priced at £16.

Customers can also pick up some 
salami earrings and a strawberry hair bobble...The funny accessories are
available online from the Fake Food Hatanaka shop.

Also available online are sushi, green pepper and hamburger earrings, bacon hair clips, French fries hairbands as well as a number of items not designed to be worn, such as plastic bowls of noodles and ice cream keyrings.

On the Hatanaka website, the fake food designers say: 'Hatanaka produces industrial arts food's model' or fake food in a self-supporting factory in Tokorozawa, Saitama.

'We make a fake food which appeals to sight for a taste by using our expert technology of the craftsman.' [sic]

Ribbons, butterflies and pretty little stars are so passe, this year all the coolest little girls will be wearing hairbands decorated with cured meats, according to the Hatanaka fake food website

The bacon and scrambled eggs hairband, left, is part of the kooky accessories range that also includes a £16 carbonara ring, complete with perfect egg yolk

A pizza necklace collar is perfect for the imaginative Italophile in your life, and costs around £75
