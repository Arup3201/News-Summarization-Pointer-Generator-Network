 A Nazi guide to Christmas - in which the Virgin Mary becomes German and the Archangel Gabriel is turned into an Ayran goddess - has been unearthed in an archive in the city of Dresden.

As well as listing precise instructions for decorating the Christmas tree, faithful yuletide revellers were to be ordered told to ditch Christmas carols in favour of more 'Germanic' ditties extolling motherhood, harvests and nature.

They include melodies which went: 'A mother enters into the world alone and is as tired as a stone: but a tree grows tall, aloof, and soon becomes her sheltering roof.'

Christmas the Nazi way: Adolf Hitler meets not one, but two, Santa Clauses during a Christmas party given by the Chief of the Chancellery in Berlin in 1937

The 20 page instruction leaflet for party members was produced in November 1937 by the Heimatwerk organisation of the Saxony branch of the Nazi Party.

The Heimatwerk was formed the previous year and billed itself as the promoter of 'Saxon Germanic culture as a shining example of true Germanness.'

It was never intended for publication but distributed to party functionaries to see that the population buckled down to the new way of doing things.

The Nazi guide to Christmas starts off by telling followers that 'no festival is as German as Christmas' and then gives instructions about how many baubles should be placed on the tree. The swastika is 'firmly recommended' to replace a fairy or an angel at the top.

Because Nazism viewed organised religion as a competitor - and therefore an enemy - of the movement, its disciples were told that it wasn't really a Christian celebration at all.

Following instructions: The 1941 Nazi Christmas party was decorated with golden swastikas on the walls

The manuscript goes on: 'The festival has been introduced against the wishes of the Church. Priests had to to reinterpret it in a Christian light, in their favour, later on. The deep mystery of the German Christmas can only be understood by those who feel its originality and authenticity.'

This was part of the Nazi hijacking of Christmas, turning it into a form of pagan worship in which Germanic myth and legends became central to the celebrations.

'Maria is the German mother,' says the manuscript,' 'and Jesus Santa Claus is no longer located in the crib, but will be relocated in a cradle to stand for the constant renewal of the German people.'

Thus it was not the Three Wise Men 'but the German workers and peasants who flock to him!' said the guide discovered in the archives of the Institute of Saxon History and Folklore in Dresden.

Presents, parents were advised, should be part of a game of hide-and-seek so that the 'entire festival will be celebrated without Christ, but as a Germanic-fertility jubilee.'

In the run up to the big day, it advised, the Nativity pageant should be replaced in schools and kindergartens with 'fairy tale performances that put a German stamp on the history of Christ's birthday.'

Hitler, who was the Messiah to so many Germans, was indeed to become the new God of the German people.

A prayer was suggested for the family to say together: 'We spent Christmas in the field, during combat, with the Germans. One was always with us... He is still with us. We greet him!'

Him is not meant to be Jesus, but Hitler, the 'Saviour of the Germans.'
