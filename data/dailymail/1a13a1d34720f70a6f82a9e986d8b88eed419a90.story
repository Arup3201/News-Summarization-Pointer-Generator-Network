Dr Liz Pope, 38, refused hospital treatment at the scene of a crash but died at home two hours later

A family doctor involved in a car crash died at home two hours after she refused hospital treatment.

Dr Liz Pope, 38, lost control of her black Alfa Romeo while overtaking a cyclist on a narrow lane near Claverley, Shropshire, on Wednesday morning.

At first she did not show any signs of being inured and declined an offer by paramedics to get checked over properly by A&E doctors.

Her husband, Trevor, 40, picked her up from the scene and took her home.

Two hours later paramedics were called to the property when she had a massive heart attack and was declared dead at the scene.

A neighbour who did not wish to be named said: 'Trevor is beside himself with grief. They were such a close couple and she was his beautiful princess - it is just so tragic.

'She was a good doctor and would have known her own body, its all a mystery at the moment.'

The GP had worked at Three Villages 
practice in Amblecote and Wollaston, near Stourbridge, West Midlands, for 
seven years and was also a member of Dudley NHS Clinical Commissioning 
Group.

Next door neighbour Alfred Downie, 85, said: 'She had an operation for a
 hole in the heart a few years ago and was taking heart tablets.

'So you don't know if that was connected at all. She was such a pleasant woman and will be sadly missed in the area. It's an absolute tragedy.'

Other
 residents in the picturesque village paid tribute and described Dr Pope
 as a lovely, cheerful and popular member of the community.

One friend, who wished to remain anonymous, said he was a member of the choir at All Saints Church in Claverley with Dr Pope.

He
 said: 'I knew her primarily from attending the church and from the 
choir which she was a member of. I knew her as long as she had lived in 
the village. She was always cheerful and was a lovely young lady, well known by everyone.'

Another
 neighbour said Dr Pope had lived in the village with her husband for 
about four years and they were a very private couple.

She
 added: 'The whole business is very sad. They were a private couple who 
went about their own business. They didn't have any children but they 
were very happy together and active.

'Everybody
 knows that doctors make the worst patients and we just wonder what 
might have happened if she had just gone for that check up.

'You never know it could have showed up something on a scan which might have saved her life.'

Speaking in a 
promotional video for the NHS Group she spoke about her love of being a 
GP for the last nine years after qualifying from medical school in 1999.Â 

Colleagues at the practice
 were too upset to talk about her sudden passing but said in a 
statement: 'Her commitment and enthusiasm for the practice, patients and
 her wider professional interests was infectious.

'She
 will be very sadly missed by her colleagues, patients and her many 
friends. Our thoughts are with her family at this painful time as we all
 try to come to terms with her untimely loss.'

Dr
 David Hegarty, chairman of Dudley Clinical Commissioning Group, said: 
'Our CCG and the GP community has suffered a terrible loss.

'Liz
 not only showed tremendous commitment to her own patients and practice,
 she gave the same commitment to improving the quality of care for 
everyone in Dudley.

'She was a great friend and inspiration to those of us privileged enough to work with her.

'No words can adequately describe how much we will miss her.'

West
 Mercia Police said the cause of death has not yet been established but 
that they were treating the incident as a fatal road traffic collision.

Pc
 Tim Lever, from Shrewsbury police, said: 'Police officers attended the 
scene, along with the fire service who righted the car and paramedics 
who assessed the woman.

'The woman appeared relatively uninjured and was collected from the scene by her partner.

'However
 sadly, just two hours later, the ambulance service was called to their 
home address following reports that she had died.

'Our
 thoughts go out to the woman's family and we have assigned a family 
liaison officer to help them at this difficult time. The male cyclist 
was not injured in the crash.'

A spokesman from West Midlands Ambulance Service added: 'Two advanced paramedics in a response car attended the scene and assessed the patient, a woman, but she chose not to go to hospital.

'At around 11am on Wednesday, the trust received a further 999 call to reports of a woman in cardiac arrest at a property in Shropshire.

'An ambulance and a responder paramedic were sent to the scene where sadly a woman was confirmed dead.'

The coroner for Shropshire has been informed and a post-mortem was carried out yesterday. The results are expected to take a few weeks .
