A father who was sent to prison for 40 years after his nine-year-old daughter falsely accused him of raping her is hoping apologetic letters written by the girl will help secure his release.

Navy veteran David Kelly, now 54, was found guilty of raping, sodomizing and sexually abusing his daughter Chaneya in their Newburgh, New York home in 1998. He remains at Green Haven Correctional Facility and is only eligible for parole in 2018.

But now his daughter, who is 24, says the attack never happened - and that she lied because her drug-addict mother forced to beat her unless she said her father abused her.

Chaneya, who has battled the courts to release her father ever since recanting her accusations the following year, penned a series of apologetic letters to him.

'Mistake': Chaneya Kelly, who is now 24, said she falsely accused her Navy veteran father of raping her as a nine-year-old because her mother threatened to beat her if she didn't

Battle: David Kelly, pictured in prison, may use apologetic letters written by his daughter to secure his release

'I didn’t want to get beat so I made up a lie that I'd take back anyday. I regret everything I said,' she said in one letter from 2002, which has been seen by the New York Post.

'It's just that I didn't want to get beaten by a "drunken" mother.'

She added that she should be the one serving a lengthy sentence, rather than her father.

'I feel guilty when I talk about it. I feel that I should be in prison instead of you,' she wrote.

In another letter from October 2006, which is signed 'Daddy's Big Girl', Chaneya said she wished she 'could change the past'.

Mr Kelly's case is now under a full 
review, but if this fails to clear his name, his attorney Peter Cross said
he will use the letters for an appeal.

Speaking to NBC News, Chaneya said: 'I'm 24-years-old and I made this mistake when I was nine-years-old - but it's never too late to try and right your wrong.'

Her father was barred from any contact with his children after being convicted by a jury of multiple counts of rape and serious sexual assault.

Kelly, who has always maintained his innocence, had never been convicted of a felony before.

'All I think is, one day the truth will set me free. All I have to do is hold on,' Kelly told NBC News.

In October 1997, while Kelly was living with his wife Charade and their five children in Newburgh, he says he was attempting to rid himself of a drug habit in order to take better care of his family.

But he said his wife's own drug habit had spiraled to the point where she turned to prostitution in order to feed her addiction.

Denial: His conviction remained even though she recanted her statement on video the following year (pictured) after her grandmother, right, took her to authorities. A judge said the recantation seemed forced

Chaneya, the Kellys' eldest child, says that one morning before school her mother asked her whether her father had ever 'touched' her.

'I was like, "What do you mean, did he touch me?" And she was like, "Did he touch you in your no-no spot?" And I would repeatedly say no,' the now 24-year-old said.

According to Ms Kelly her mother threatened to beat her if she did not 'tell me the answer that I want to hear'.

She said she told her mother her father had molested her to avoid being beaten, even though it wasn't true.

Kelly was taken in for questioning on
October 29 1997. There was no definitive forensic evidence to prove 
Chaneya had been raped, but the little girl and her mother's story - 
together with some suspect answers Kelly provided during questioning - 
were enough for officers to charge the father of five.

He
refused a plea deal that would have made him eligible for parole in six
years, and within a year was sentenced to up to 40 years following a 
trial by jury.

Old life: Her mother Charade (pictured) said she was in the grip of drugs when she made the claims

His daughter was sent to live with her grandmother, a Pentecostal minister, and six months later Chaneya told her grandmother her father had never raped her.

Pat Thomas took her granddaughter to Kelly's attorney who videotaped the child's recantation.

Her mother, Charade, also submitted a sworn affidavit to the court which said she threatened to beat her daughter until she said her father raped her.

A judge refused to vacate Kelly's conviction, deciding the recantation appeared forced.

Kelly, who remains in jail to this day, began studying law and has filed multiple appeals.

His daughter visited him in prison when she persuaded the courts to allow her to have contact with him at the age of 15.

'The first thing my dad did was that he 
hugged me and he told me that he loved me and... that he doesn’t blame 
me for anything,' she said.

Wrongful conviction? Chaneya's father Daryl Kelly as spent almost 16 years in jail for molesting her - a crime his daughter now says never occurred

Appeals: Chaneya persuaded the courts to allow her to have contact with her father again when she was 15-years-old

Chaneya's mother has said she is now drug-free and confirms her daughter's story, blaming a drug binge for her threats.

Frank Phillips, the Orange County District Attorney and chief prosecutor when Daryl Kelly stood trial, has emphasized that Kelly was found guilty by a jury.

He said in an interview it was 'not unique' for the victim of a sexual crime to want to protect the abuser by withdrawing their accusation.

Onondaga County District Attorney William Fitzpatrick is leading a re-investigation into the Kelly case.

His office and the detective behind the original police investigation in Newburgh both declined to comment.
