A Cambridge restaurant has been voted the best fine-dining establishment in the UK and the second-best in the world and Europe.

The two Michelin-starred Midsummer House  scooped the top prize in the 2014 Travellers' Choice Restaurant Awards, based on reviews by millions of TripAdvisor users.

The eatery, owned by chef Daniel Clifford, beat last year's winner, Raymond Blanc's Le Manoir Aux Quat'Saisons, which slipped to second place.

France's Epicure in Paris placed number five in Europe and number seven in the world

James Kay, TripAdvisor spokesman, said: 'Over half of British travellers have visited a particular destination just to go to a specific restaurant, so a great fine dining establishment can give a real visitor boost not just to that business, but to the local area too.

'With winning restaurants spread right across the UK, these awards are further proof of the country's thriving fine dining scene.'

Ground-breaking chef Grant Achatz's Alinea in Chicago was voted the fifth best restaurant in the world and the number one restaurant in the US.

Widely regarded as the world leader in culinary innovation, Mr Achatz who wasn't able to taste the food he made due to battling tongue cancer, serves an avant-garde menu of beautifully crafted dishes such as edible balloons (made from dehydrated apples and filled with helium) and edible string, a dish comprising corn, white chocolate, honey and mango.

Geranium, in Copenhagen, located on the eighth floor of Denmark's national football stadium was the only Scandinavian restaurant to make it into the European top ten list, coming in at number nine. 

Australiasia was represented by New Zealand's The French Café, run by husband and wife team Creghan Molloy Wright and Simon Wright, serving modern French cuisine. 

The Auckland restaurant came in fourth in the worldwide ratings.

A survey of more than 3,000 British travellers by TripAdvisor also revealed a third (33 per cent) of diners have visited a restaurant because of its celebrity chef, while more than two thirds of those who go to fine dining restaurants (69 per cent) seek recommendations from online reviews
