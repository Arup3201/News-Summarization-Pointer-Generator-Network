Britain's first ever 'cat cafe' where customers can enjoy a cup of coffee in the company of several felines officially opened its doors this morning.

The grand opening of Lady Dinah's Cat Emporium in Bethnal Green, east London, was much anticipated by animal lovers across the capital.

Within hours of its opening date being announced online, the cafe's website crashed when 3,000 people attempted to book a table.

The UK's first cat cafe Lady Dinah's Cat Emporium opened today in Shoreditch, London

No doubt they were hoping to enjoy a selection of sandwiches, cakes, teas and coffees while stroking 11 residents cats and kittens - named Adamska, Artemis, 
Biscuit, Carbonelle, Donnie, Indiana, Loki, Mue, Petra, Romeo and 
Wookie.

But this morning Lady Dinah's looked a little quiet - with only a handful customers waiting for it to open.

The cafe's website explains the concept: 'It's not just about being able to play with the cats.

The cafe is owned by 31-year-old Australian Lauren Pears - a self confessed 'crazy cat lady'

'It's about the whole experience: a small indulgence, a place to forget 
about your day and unwind.

'It's about coming in from the cold to a 
comfortable wingback chair, a hot cup of tea, a book, and a cat.'

The unusual eatery is owned by 31-year-old Australian Lauren Pears - who is a self confessed 'crazy cat lady.'

The shop is located in Bethnal Green, east London. Ms Pears raised £108,000 for her business via the site

After hearing of the runaway success of cat cafes in Asia, she started her campaign to raise over £100,000 on the site on Christmas Eve 2012 - a target which was exceeded within two months.

One Russian animal welfare campaigner Anna Kogan, who is now the co-owner of the emporium, invested around £200,000 in the business - enough for Ms Pears to get a visa to stay in the UK.

Speaking earlier this year, Ms Pears said: ‘If something exists you can probably get it in London, but there’s one thing that lots of people living in London can’t have – a kitty.

The owners hope customers will come to the shop to 'forget about' their days and 'unwind with a cat'

‘We thought long and hard about who would really benefit from having a cat café in London.

'I see commuters walking on their way to and from the station stopping to pet the neighbourhood cats, and since I am unable to own a cat myself due to my current flat and long hours I understand the desire to have a cat around.'

The cafe is decorated in a vintage Victorian theme.

Customers can also buy a selection of gifts and mementos via the Lady Dinah's website.
