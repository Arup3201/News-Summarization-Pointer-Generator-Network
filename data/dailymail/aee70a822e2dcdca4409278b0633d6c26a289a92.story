A senior Communist Party official says that 'uncivilised behaviour' by Chinese tourists is harming China's image abroad.

Wang Yang, one of the country's four vice-prime ministers, said holidaymakers should be more polite, singling out talking loudly and spitting as poor behaviour by his fellow citizens.

It was revealed last month that the Chinese are the world's biggest spending tourists, splashing out $102billion on foreign trips in 2012, according to the United Nations World Tourism Organisation.

Chinese tourists make 83million trips abroad last year, compared with only 10million in 2000, becoming the single biggest source of global tourism income.

Writing in the official party newspaper 
People's Daily, Mr Wang said: 'Improving the civilised quality of the 
citizens and building a good image of Chinese tourists are the 
obligations of governments at all levels and relevant agencies and 
companies.'

He said Chinese authorities should 'guide
 tourists to conscientiously abide by public order and social ethics, 
respect local religious beliefs and customs, mind their speech and 
behaviour... and protect the environment'.

However, some Chinese tourists say they are treated 'like second-class citizens' when they are abroad.

'Chinese internet forums were flooded with protests earlier this year when news emerged that a hotel in the Maldives had removed kettles from rooms occupied by Chinese tourists,' said the BBC's Beiijing correspondent Celia Hatton.

'Apparently, the hotel's manager was upset that some Chinese tourists were using boiling water to eat instant noodles in their rooms, instead of spending money in the hotel's restaurants.'
