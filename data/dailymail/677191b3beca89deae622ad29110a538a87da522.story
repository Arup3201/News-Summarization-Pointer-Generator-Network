She's engaged to one of the world's most famous athletes, so it's hardly surprising that Christine Bleakley takes her exercise regime seriously.

Christine, 35, who has been living in Cheshire while fiance Frank Lampard is on loan to Manchester City, has shared her New Year's health and fitness advice and opened her make-up bag for FEMAIL as she poses in a new beauty shoot.

The tanned and toned TV presenter said: 'I have got to the point now when I feel there is no point starting a New Year’s Resolution as I often find it hard sticking to them but when I do, I normally just try to eat healthier and avoid having snacks around the house so much.

Glowing: Christine Bleakley shows off her tanned and toned figure in her new Soft & Gentle campaign - and claims her svelte shape is down to spinning classes, a balanced diet and 'lots of walking'

'Also make sure I get to the gym as often as I can, which I’m normally quite good at doing.'

The results are clear to see. Christine shows off her enviable physique in her new campaign for Soft & Gentle deodorant.

So what's her secret? 'I love working out at classes and in recent months I have enjoyed spin classes maybe one or twice a week,' she said. 'It is the one class that I sweat so much I know I have had a good workout.

'I am also a massive fan of walking, which I do lots of and my sister lost a lot of weight many years ago through walking and has kept it off so I know what a positive effect it has on health and fitness levels.'

What's her secret? Christine says she won't cut anything out of her diet and will substitute a jacket potato for a sweet potato when she's trying to be healthy 

As well as a healthy exercise regime, the svelte star maintains a balanced approached to eating, too.

She said: 'If I have been away eating and drinking for a while, like at Christmas, I just try and eat healthy when I am back to get back in shape.

'I won't cut anything out and think I have a healthy diet. I would try and substitute a jacket potato for a sweet potato when I am trying to be healthy and avoid eating carbs too late at night as I find it does bloat me out.'

Speaking about her personal style, she said: 'I love the change in season and love getting into the winter time. I have to buy a new coat and boots in the winter as a staple treat for myself.

'I love Olivia Palermo. I’ve always liked her and the American LA look, I think she looks beautiful in every picture you see.'

Discussing how her look has developed over the years, she said: 'I would say I have become a lot more simple in terms of style and really like clean, fresh looks.

'I like tailored clothes especially the Victoria Beckham collection, which suit my shape and I’m not great with loose things.'

Describing herself as a 'bag girl' rather that a shoe aficionado, Christine explains that her favourite tote is one that Frank brought her five years ago and was her first expensive bag. 

'It was a lovely small, simple Chanel black bag which gets an outing at least once a week,' she added.

Beauty buff: Christine takes cues from the age of the supermodels and admires Cindy Crawford

While she labours over her fashion choices, glamorous Christine maintains that she can get ready in 15 minutes.

She takes cues from the age of the supermodels and thinks that Cindy Crawford was 'one of the most beautiful women' in the world.

'I think she and Catherine Zeta Jones are both stunning, always look amazing and don’t ever seem to age. 

'In terms of more up-to-date celebrities, I would say Jennifer Aniston always comes across as being very natural and fresh looking and looks great for her age.'
