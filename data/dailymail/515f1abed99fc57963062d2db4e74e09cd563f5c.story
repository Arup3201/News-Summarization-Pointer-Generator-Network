A leaping penguin takes the plunge into icy waters in Antarctica as its companions prepare to follow suit in this incredible image.

The playful penguins were captured leaping from rock to rock and jumping into the sea off Cuverville Island.

Photographer Paul Souders, from Seattle, U.S., spent several days documenting the antics of gentoo and king penguins in freezing temperatures on Antarctic islands, capturing breathtaking scenes that resemble a real-life version of the hit animated film Happy Feet.

One photograph captures a gentoo in mid-air above the ocean, leaving a trail of droplets in its wake.

Gentoo penguins reach a height of 30 inches and weigh around 12lbs when fully grown.

Like other breeds of penguin, gentoos can appear awkward waddling around on land, but the creatures are quite at home in the water.

Their
streamlined bodies and paddle-shaped flippers can propel them to speeds of
up to 22 miles an hour under water - faster than any other diving bird.
