Sam Allardyce does not expect his West Ham contract to be renewed until the last minute — but believes only a change in ownership will scupper his chances of a new deal.

Allardyce has overseen a stunning season despite not knowing if he will have a future at the club beyond the summer, when his contract runs out.

No talks have yet been planned but Allardyce, whose previous two-year extension was signed in May 2013, insisted he is ‘comfortable’ to wait.

Allardyce has managed to prove his doubters wrong by turning around West Ham's fortunes this season 

James Tomkins scored the winner against West Brom to propel West Ham to their seventh win of this season 

‘I think it will happen like it did last time when we get closer to the end of the season,’ he said. ‘We will decide on where we are going and what we are going to do.

‘Just after getting promoted [in 2012] there were no new contract talks in the Premier League until April and the back of end May. It will probably be the same this time round. I’ve always been comfortable with that. I was last time and I’m comfortable with it this time.’

By Allardyce’s logical rationale, which is that good results will keep him safe, his future should be all but assured after an excellent start to the season. They face Swansea at Upton Park on Sunday looking for an eighth win of the campaign, boosted by the possible return of Alex Song and Diafra Sakho from injury.

Allardyce said: ‘Whether you have a contract or haven’t got a contract, if you have good results you’re fine. If you haven’t got good results, whether you have a contract or not, you get sacked.

‘If you get a set of new owners then they might not like you and it doesn’t matter how well you do, they’ll move you on. From that point of view, I can’t see West Ham being sold at this moment in time.’

And he added: ‘We are winning a lot of people over. But any fans at any club, when results are not going well, make themselves heard. You always win them over if you start winning, playing better and buy better players.’

Senegalese striker Diafra Sakho is also expected to return after recovering from a a shoulder problem
