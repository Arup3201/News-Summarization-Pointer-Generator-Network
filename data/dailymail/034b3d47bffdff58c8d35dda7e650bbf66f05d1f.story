Statistics: There are two million Britons either with cancer or in recovery (file picture)

The number of Britons diagnosed with cancer annually has soared by almost 50,000 to more than 330,000 in a decade.

Experts blame the rise on an ageing population, as well as obesity and alcohol consumption, which can trigger the disease.

But the number of cases is placing a growing burden on the NHS, with more patients needing expensive treatment as well as long-term care for side-effects.

There are two million Britons either with cancer or in recovery. Some will develop heart conditions, lung problems or other complications as a result of treatment.

Figures from Cancer Research UK reveal that 330,000 cases were diagnosed in 2011, up from 283,000 in 2001. This included 50,000 with breast cancer, 40,695 with bowel cancer, 40,975 with prostate cancer, 42,026 with lung cancer and 12,818 with skin cancer.

Chief executive Dr Harpal Kumar said: ‘These figures reinforce the vital need for more research to better prevent, treat and cure cancer.

‘One day we will beat cancer. The more research we do, the sooner that day will come.’

The charity says nearly two thirds of cases are diagnosed in the over-65s. But obesity and alcohol are believed to increase the risk of breast and bowel cancers, among others.

Thanks to improved treatment and earlier diagnosis, patients now live for six years on average after being diagnosed, compared with just one in the Seventies. But this creates extra problems for the NHS with more patients needing treatment for cancer and re-occurring tumours as well as for the drugs themselves.

Side-effects: Some sufferers can develop heart conditions, lung problems or other complications as a result of treatment for the disease

Radiotherapy and chemotherapy can cause lifelong complications including heart problems, lung disease, immobility, depression and bone-thinning.

Mike Hobday, of Macmillan Cancer Support, said: ‘We are concerned that the NHS will simply not be able to cope with this surge in demand.

‘There needs to be a fundamental shift towards proper aftercare, with more delivered in the community.’

The charity estimates that by 2030, four million Britons will have cancer or be in remission.
