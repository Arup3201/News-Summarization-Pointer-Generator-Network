Three California men excited at the prospect of training in Afghanistan to become terrorists prepared, authorities say, by simulating combat with paintball rifles, wiping their Facebook profiles of any Islamic references and concocting cover stories.

Just two days before they were going to board a plane bound for Istanbul - and then onto Afghanistan - FBI agents thwarted plans that officials said included killing Americans and bombing U.S. military bases overseas.

The arrests last week in the U.S. and of the man said to be the ringleader, 34-year-old American Sohiel Omar Kabir, in Afghanistan was laid out in a 77-page affidavit, which included references to the group's online video conversations and audio recordings.

While authorities don't believe there
were any plans for an attack in the U.S., two of the men arrested told a
confidential FBI informant they would consider American jihad, 
according to the court documents unsealed in federal court Monday.

The arrests are the latest in a 
series of cases where U.S. residents were targeted to become terrorists.
Last month, a Minneapolis man was convicted of helping send young men 
to Somalia to join the al-Qaida-linked terrorist group al-Shabab.

Along with Kabir, Ralph Deleon, 
Miguel Alejandro Santana Vidriales and Arifeen David Gojali are facing 
charges of providing material support to terrorists.

The charges can carry a maximum 15-year prison sentence upon conviction.

Defense attorneys did not immediately return calls for comment.

Federal investigators said Kabir met 
Deleon and Santana at a hookah bar and introduced them to the radical 
Islamist doctrine of the U.S.-born extremist cleric Anwar al-Awlaki, who
was killed last year in an American airstrike in Yemen.

Kabir, a naturalized U.S. citizen from Afghanistan, served in the Air Force from 2000 to 2001.

He spent some time at Davis Monthan 
Air Force Base in Tucson, Ariz., pulling aircraft or vehicle parts from a
supply store. He was administratively separated for unknown reasons and
was given an honorable discharge, the military said.

'It was a standard enlistment that ended early but not for reasons of misconduct,' said Air Force spokeswoman Ann Stefanek.

According to the court documents, 
Deleon said meeting Kabir was like encountering someone from the camps 
run by al-Awlaki or Osama bin Laden, who was killed in a U.S. raid last 
year on his compound in Pakistan.

Kabir was 'basically a mujahid 
walking the streets of LA,' Deleon said, using the term for holy 
warrior, according to court documents. 'He was just waiting to get his 
papers. And I met him at the point of his life where he was about to 
go.'

Authorities wouldn't say how the 
investigation began, but they tracked Kabir's travels last year and 
flagged violent extremist messages posted online by Santana. Covert FBI 
agents had conversations with Santana online where he expressed his 
support of jihad and desire to join al-Qaida.

'We were on them for quite a while,' said FBI Special Agent David Bowdich.

In video calls from Afghanistan, 
Kabir told the trio he would arrange their meetings with terrorists, 
investigators said. Kabir added they could sleep in mosques or the homes
of other jihadists once they arrived in Afghanistan.

Whispers of terror: The four suspects were reportedly influenced by the writings of U.S.-born radical Muslim cleric Anwar al-Awlaki, who was killed in a U.S. drone strike last year

Stateside, Deleon and Santana were 
eager about the prospects of being terrorists. When asked by the FBI 
informant if both men had thought about how it would feel to kill 
someone, Santana responded, 'The more I think about it, the more it 
excites me.'

The two men also discussed where they
could do the most damage. After considering going to Palestine and the 
Philippines, Santana said he preferred Afghanistan because the military 
bases there could easily be ambushed.

Santana said he was easily influenced 
by people growing up and spent time around gangs. He said converting to 
Islam was a good move for him because he could fit in and 'actually 
fight for something that's right,' according to court documents.

Santana, 21, was born in Mexico, while Deleon, 23, was born in the Philippines. Both are lawful, permanent U.S. residents.

Jen Collins, who lives two doors down
from Santana's apartment in Upland, east of Los Angeles, said at least a
dozen FBI agents swarmed his unit early Friday. 'It was like something 
coming out of the movies or TV,' Collins said.

The apartment was shuttered on 
Tuesday, but someone inside removed a sign that read 'Don't burn the 
Qur'an, READ IT!' from a shuttered upstairs window as reporters gathered
outside.

Targets: The men were allegedly plotting to fight alongside the Taliban against U.S. troops in Afghanistan

Deleon studied business 
administration at California State University, San Bernardino, but 
withdrew in September after first enrolling five years ago, said 
university spokesman Joe Gutierrez.

Court documents show the men talked about their propensity for violence.

Santana, who claimed he went to 
Mexico to learn how to shoot different kinds of guns and how to make 
explosives, wanted to be a sniper. Deleon said he hoped he could be on 
the front lines or use C-4, an explosive, in an attack.

Gojali, a U.S. citizen, was recruited in late September and he said he would be willing to kill, court documents state.

'I watch videos on the Internet, and I
see what they are doing to our brothers and sisters. ... It makes me 
cry, and it gets like I'm, like, so angered with them,' Gojali said.

Gojali's father, Ghazali Musa, said 
he hadn't heard from his son for three months when he suddenly showed up
at the family house last week and said he was leaving on a long trip 
with a friend.

Gojali's younger sister said the family learned of his arrest through news reports that left them stunned.

'He's not even remotely close to 
being violent at all,' the 18-year-old sister told the Associated Press 
in an interview in front of the family home. 'He's not capable of any of
this.'

She said Gojali - vulnerable, 
unemployed and lacking even a high school diploma - had recently become 
fast friends with Deleon, who was a compelling speaker and popular 
figure at the mosque the two attended.

'I just think he was lost. I think 
peer pressure is one of his biggest problems in life, and that's why 
he's in trouble now,' said the sister, who requested anonymity because 
she did not want to be associated with the alleged crimes. 'A lot of 
people are saying he was brainwashed by this guy, and my brother, not 
being employed, he offered him rides to places, and to him that was a 
sign of a true friend.'

This past summer, plans to travel to Afghanistan became clearer for the group.

They talked about how they would 
avoid detection. They talked about opening an Afghan orphanage or 
possibly posing as cologne salesmen. They finally devised a cover story 
that they were going to attend Kabir's fictional wedding.

It's unclear whether Kabir actually 
made contact with Taliban or al-Qaida fighters, but in an August video 
conversation with Deleon, Kabir was with a shiekh or an imam, the 
complaint said.

Kabir also had intended to go on a 
suicide mission earlier this month but got sick, according to the court 
documents. He indicated he would wait for the group, which included the 
FBI informant, before staging an attack, according to the affidavit.

Court documents also show the 
confidential informant had been working with the FBI for more than four 
years and received more than $250,000 and unspecified immigration 
benefits. The informant had been previously convicted of trafficking 
pseudoephedrine.

Before going, Deleon said he was 
going to leave parents a farewell letter. Asked by the informant if 
Deleon could lie about his true intentions in the letter, Deleon said, 
it's OK to lie in war. 'I believe right now ... we are in a state of 
war,' he said.

Using the informant's debit card, 
Deleon bought four tickets for a flight from Mexico City to Istanbul 
scheduled to leave this past Sunday. Had the men made it to Afghanistan,
they would have initially joined the Taliban and then graduate to 
al-Qaida, Bowdich said.

'They saw this as jihad. They saw this as their way to push out the aggressors,' Bowdich said.

Even if he failed in a terrorist training camp, Santana said, he would continue trying.

'If for some weird reason, if I can't 
handle it, I'm not going to give up,' he said, according to court 
documents. 'Like, because, this is my strong intention. This is what I 
desire of doing in this life.'
