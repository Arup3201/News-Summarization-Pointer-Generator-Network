A ten-year-old girl was almost buried alive in sand after her family dug a 4ft hole and put her inside it.

Only the top of the girl’s head was visible on a beach in Norfolk - and National Coastwatch volunteers  who feared the sides of the hole could collapse told her relatives to pull her out immediately.

They spoke with the girl's father and told him to fill in the hole on Caister beach as soon as possible.

Rescue required: Only the top of the girl's head was visible on Caister beach in Norfolk on Saturday

Michael Cooke, station manager at the 
Caister branch of volunteer group the National Coastwatch Institution, 
said of the incident: ‘The family had been digging a deep hole on 
Caister beach.

‘Our 
watchkeepers on duty, Alan Perry and Malcolm Magee, were quick to spot 
when the young girl went into the hole and all that was visible was her 
head.

‘Should the 
hole have collapsed then she could have been buried alive. But thanks to
 the watchkeepers quick thinking and kind words all ended safely.’

And watchkeeper Mr Perry told the Eastern Daily Press of the incident last Saturday: ‘People, especially those on holiday, don’t always see the dangers in front of them.

Previous incident: On the same beach three years ago in August 2011, Paige Anderson (pictured), 15, of Gravesend, Kent, was airlifted to hospital after a 5ft hole she had been digging collapsed without warning

‘We’d been keeping an eye on them, but it was when the girl got in and you couldn’t see her that we knew we had to step in. It got to the point where you couldn’t see her when she stood up.

'Sand that far down is very compacted and, if she had been digging a tunnel which a lot of kids do, she would have been buried alive'

Alan Perry, National Coastwatch Institution watchkeeper

‘If it had collapsed then she would have been in a lot of trouble. Sand that far down is very compacted and, if she had been digging a tunnel which a lot of kids do, she would have been buried alive.’

On the same beach three years ago in August 2011, Paige Anderson, 15, of Gravesend, Kent, was airlifted to hospital after a 5ft hole she had been digging collapsed without warning.

She miraculously survived - despite turning blue and stopping breathing - after being trapped for a quarter of an hour as paramedics, police, lifeboatmen and coastguards frantically dug her out.

Paige was playing with her sisters Jade, 19, and Taylor, nine, on the beach when disaster struck. She was about to climb out of the hole they had been digging when the sides suddenly caved in.
