The man who inspired the ALS Ice Bucket Challenge, the viral sensation which is raising money to fight Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS), has become a new dad.

Pete Frates announced on Sunday that his wife, Julie, had given birth to Lucy Fitzgerald Frates, a healthy baby girl who weighed 7 pounds 8 ounces.

‘Little Lucy Frates has arrived and Mom, Dad and Lucy are perfect,’ Frates wrote on his Facebook page.

Frates, 29, who lives in Beverly, Massachusetts is a former captain of Boston College Baseball.

In 2012 he was diagnosed with ALS – also known as Lou Gehrig's disease – a degenerative disease that hits the nerves and the brain and can lead to paralysis and death. 

There is no cure, though a treatment now available can extend the life expectancy for its sufferers.

Since his diagnosis, Frates has devoted much of his time to raising awareness about the condition and along with his family and friends he came up with the ice bucket challenge as a creative way to get people excited about raising money for ALS research. 

Before Pete Frates was diagnosed with ALS in 2012, he had been captain of Boston College Baseball

The social media craze sees people getting drenched in a chilly mixture of freezing cold water and ice cubes and a host of star have taken part including Oprah Winfrey and Matt Damon.

After gaining incredible momentum through social media during July and August, more than 3 million people around the world have joined in the challenge and raised more than $100 million for the ALS Association. 

By comparison, the ALS Association raised $2.8 million during the same time period last year. 

Pete Frates’ father John Frates told WCVB that the birth was 'the perfect ending to the miracle month of August.'

Frates wrote that baby Lucy's arrival was an ‘amazing blessing as the exclamation point to the miraculous month of August 2014!’
