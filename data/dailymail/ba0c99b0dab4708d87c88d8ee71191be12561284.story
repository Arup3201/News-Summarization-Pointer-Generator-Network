All three people aboard a small private plane died when their plane crashed near a Colorado ski town, police confirmed today.

The single-engine Beechcraft Bonanza took off from the airport at about 11am on Sunday on its way to Cortez, a city in southwest Colorado about 75 miles away, San Miguel County Sheriff Bill Masters said in a news release.

Air traffic control at the Telluride and Denver airports lost contact with the plane, prompting a search by the sheriff's office at 12:40 p.m.

The scene today just one mile away from Telluride airport, Colarado, where a private plan crashed, killing three

It was found crashed into a cliff band 
about a mile west of the airport at 5:17 p.m., and deputies confirmed 
there were no survivors, the sheriff said.

'This is certainly not the outcome we were hoping for, it's just a terrible, terrible tragedy,' Mr Masters said.

The cause of the crash is not yet known, Federal Aviation Administration spokesman Ian Gregor said.

There was light snow, with visibility of one mile and light winds during takeoff, Mr Masters added.

The last communication with the pilot was from the Telluride runway during takeoff, he said.

The sheriff said recovery efforts will start later today and that the county coroner's office was expected to release the identities of those killed once their families are notified.

The sheriff's office said a helicopter it contracted, a fixed-wing aircraft from the Civil Air Patrol and deputies took part in the hourslong search.

Airport officials and the Telluride fire chief referred questions to the sheriff's office.

The FAA and the National Transportation Safety Board will investigate the accident, Mr Gregor said.

Sorry we are unable to accept comments for legal reasons.
