The two siblings of a wealthy Manhattan real estate mogul are currently at war with each other in court as they attempt to track down a secret stash of buried gold and silver their brother only told them about right before he died.

Robert Giaimo and Janet Vitale have been on a high-profile treasure for the gold coins and silver bars worth an estimated $4.5 million since 2007 and are still yet to find the collection.

Their brother, Edward Giaimo Jr, who owned 18 properties on the Upper East Side, died at the age of 67 without her disclosing the location, DNA Info are reporting.

Court papers say the 200,000 Troy ounces of silver and 1,000 Krugerrands are either buried at the family's property in Pelham Manor, New York, or in an unknown storage facility.

'X' marks the spot?: Siblings Robert Giaimo and Janet Vitale have been searching for eight years for $4.5 million worth of gold and silver that had been hidden by their late brother, which could be buried on the family's Pelham Manor property (pictured)

Robert and Janet were locked in a court battle over documents that could hold the vital clues as to where the treasure is buried.

The battle is just part of a fight over how to split their brother's fortune, which tallies at $48 million.

Robert Giaimo sued his sister in 2008 for not letting him into the Pelham Manor house where Edward and their mother lived.

At the time Janet had just discovered $7 million cash hidden behind a closet in the attic.

She also found $3 million in a safe in the basement.

The money had come from their late brother skimming rent money that had been paid to the family business from the tenants in their many buildings, according to DNA Info.

Janet had taken over the family business before Edward's death.

The siblings are still fighting over what will happen to the $10 million that was found.

Following Edward's death in 2007, Janet claimed Robert had tried to conceal the location of the treasure from her. 

'Edward mentioned that there was some gold and silver bars or whatever you want to call them,' Janet said.

'And I was cut off immediately by Robert and he said, 'You don't want to know about that.

'You will go to jail,' so I didn't hear any more about it. 

'That was the end of it.'

Despite an eight-year search, it is still unclear whether they ever found the stash of precious metals.
