An IT specialist is suing for £150,000 claiming an accident at work has left him with unique disabilities preventing him from texting or using other gadgets.

Isaak Alpman says he has been left with a 'misshapen right index finger', amongst other disabilities, which have seen him go from working at the forefront of the computer world to being unable to use a normal mouse and keyboard.

The 59-year-old says his injuries are so bad he cannot get work and even has to get his son to send text messages on his behalf.

Proceedings: A computer expert is suing at the High Court for £150,000 after a fall at work injured his finger, preventing him from texting and using gadgets

Mr Alpman, of Rochester, Kent, claims he suffered his affliction when he fell down a flight of stairs while working in the computer server room at the West London headquarters of vintage and collectibles dealer, the Music and Goods Exchange Ltd, in April 2011.

He has now issued a High Court writ claiming damages from the company of up to £150,000, on the basis that the staircase where the alleged accident took place was 'unsafe' and breached Health and Safety at Work regulations.

In the writ, Mr Alpman's barrister, Gavin Argent, says that the accident happened on April 7 2011 as the IT specialist was climbing the 'steep' first floor stairs to the server room at his employer's HQ.

'He tripped on the staircase, twisted to the right, hit the wall on the right side and fell backwards down the staircase, hitting his head and sustaining personal injuries,' the barrister said.

'The staircase was narrow, old and worn, making it unsafe, and furthermore the hand rail to the left of the staircase was dangerous and unusable because running the length of the stair rail was a live electric cable.

'Mr Alpman was unable to grab hold of the handrail in order to prevent his fall down the stairs,' the barrister adds.

Claim: Isaak Alpman's fall down some stairs means he struggles to use a mouse or keyboard (posed by model)

Mr Alpman suffered injuries to his right shoulder, knee, hands and spine and is now said to be 'at a disadvantage on the open labour market and disabled.

'He was dismissed by the defendant within a month of the accident and has been unable to work or find work since...he is unable to get another job in IT because, when he discloses his injuries, he is rejected,' the barrister claims.

He goes on to describe Mr Alpman's injuries which have led to his trouble with technology, the foremost of which is his problem with his index finger.

'He has developed carpal tunnel syndrome since the incident. His right index finger has become misshapen. He is unable to use a computer mouse and standard keyboard. Text messages are sent by his son on his behalf,' Mr Argent states.

'He is unable to lift or raise his arm on the right side above waist level. He cannot carry anything in his right hand and is now unable to write with that hand. He is right handed.'

The company's defence to the action was not available from the court, and the allegations in the writ have yet to be tested in evidence before a judge.
