Many may love it, but Marmite has been named as one of Britain's top ten most hated brands, beaten only by political parties Ukip and the Conservatives.

Starbucks also made it into the list, but there was better news for Heinz and Cadbury's  - which are among the nation's favourites, according to the new poll.

The study of 1,500 people by advertising agency Isobel looked at both the most loved and most hated brands in Britain.

Many may love it, but Marmite has been named as one of Britain's top ten most hated brands, beaten only by political parties Ukip and the Conservatives

Ukip, headed by Nigel Farage, was named as the most hated brand in Britain, faring worse than its political rivals as well as other brands such as Ryanair, McDonald's, Starbucks and Facebook

Ukip was named as the most hated brand in Britain, faring worse than its political rivals as well as other brands such as Ryanair, McDonald's, Starbucks and Facebook.

But notably all of these are incredibly successful, suggesting their place in the 'most hated' list is because they divide opinion rather than be universally disliked.

Despite the controversy over the amount of tax it pays - or does not pay - delivery giant Amazon was voted the most loved brand in the country.

Snack firm Cadbury was the second most loved, with Brits big fans of the chocolate brand

Yet Starbucks, which has also faced criticism over its tax policy in the UK, was among the ten most hated list.

Amazon was followed in the positive list by snack firms Cadbury and Walkers with Heinz in fourth.

The rest of the top ten saw the BBC beat Google and rivals ITV with Tesco the only supermarket represented and Boots and Kelloggs making up the list. 

Paul Houlding, Isobel's managing director, said: 'It would seem that longevity works wonders for most.

David Cameron's Conservatives came third in the 'Most Hated' poll, while Ed Miliband's Labour was fifth

Ukip was named as the most hated brand in Britain, faring worse than its political rivals as well as brands such as Ryanair

According to the poll, food spread Marmite is more popular than Ukip or the Conservatives

'All, bar two of the top 10, predate the 1960s. Affection, it seems, has been hard won.

'But it's not just about affection, it's about relevance and usefulness and what better proof of that formula than Amazon and Google.

'Brands that are useful to us, brands that make our lives easier, brands that do what they promise.'

Consumers polled had to rank brands for a number of factors including their loyalty, how much they rely on them and whether they would miss them if they were gone.

Paul Houlding, Isobel's managing director, said it was 'no shock to anyone' that political parties, including Ukip and the Conservatives 'are all in the same unloved boat'

In the most hated, Ukip's number one position with almost one-third of the votes (30 per cent) put the party headed by Nigel Farage just ahead of the Conservatives in second with 27 per cent.

Labour and the Liberal Democrats took fifth and sixth with Marmite and Ryanair ahead of them and McDonald's, Starbucks, Facebook and KFC completing the table. 

'It will come as no shock to anyone (least of all the politicians themselves) that the political parties are all in the same unloved boat' said Mr Houlding.

'But will it concern them? When it comes to polling day are we voting for the party we love or are we voting for the party of most use?'  

Heinz, famous for its tomato ketchup and baked beans, came fourth in the 'Most Loved' poll results

The rest of the top ten saw the BBC beat Google and rivals ITV with Tesco the only supermarket represented
