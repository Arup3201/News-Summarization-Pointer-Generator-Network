Held: Mother-of-nine Antonia Benitez has been accused of starving her 4-year-old daughter

A mother-of-nine has been accused of starving her four-year-old daughter who weighed just 18lbs.

Antonia Benitez, 35, of Santa Ana, was arrested yesterday after leaving her daughter at a hospital last month.

The 4-year-old was suffering from an infected wound on her leg and malnutrition.

Doctors at the hospital called social services who then alerted police officers.

As reported by NBC, Benitez is now facing multiple counts of child abuse.

According to the National Center for Health Statistics, the average 4-year-old weighs 34lbs.

However, Benitezâ€™s daughter was just 18lbs when taken to the hospital.

Police said the 35-year-old mother was raising her nine children on her own.

They are now been looked after by social services or family members.

The Orange County District Attorney has now filed three counts of felony child abuse against the mother, who is scheduled to appear in court today.

If Benitez is convicted, she faces a maximum jail term of 14 years and six months.

Benitez allegedly took her daughter to the hospital for being underweight In July 2012.

However, it was not reported to the police.
