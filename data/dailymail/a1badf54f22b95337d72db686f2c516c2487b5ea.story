Budget airline passengers could soon be spared the ordeal of a seating free-for-all when they board their flights.

EasyJet is to trial allocated seating on selected routes in the spring, following a similar move by rival Ryanair.

Travellers are currently unable to choose a seat until they board the plane.

The allocated seating plan should end the stampede that usually precedes easyJet boarding times

Those who have purchased speedy 
boarding or are travelling with young children have priority, but even 
there is no guarantee of a particular seat.

The
trial of allocated seating is seen as another step on the road to 
increasing easyJet’s appeal to business customers. Shares fell 3 per 
cent following today’s update.

Ryanair currently charges a fee for a seat in the front row and has recently extended its reserved seating trial on 80 routes.

Although the move has not made the airline's 25-minute turnaround any longer, a spokesman said the carrier has no plans to extend the programme to the entire plane.

The majority of passengers taking part in easyJet’s trial are not expected to pay for their seats, although the airline has admitted it plans to charge for popular spots such as the first few rows and seats over the wings.

Chief executive Carolyn McCall said it 
was too early to specify how much passengers would have to pay for the 
option, nor had the airline decided which routes would take part in the 
trial.

She told the Financial Times the trial 
was dependent on positive customer feedback and added: ‘If it increases 
boarding time we won’t do it.’

Carolyn McCall, easyJet chief executive, says the airline is looking at whether allocated seating increases boarding time. Meanwhile, founder Sir Stelios Haji-Ioannou has pushed for higher shareholder dividends

The news comes as the airline revealed a rise in profits today but warned it will become harder to pass higher fuel prices on to passengers.

The group reported a 31.5 per cent 
increase in underlying profits to £248 million in the year to September 
30, which was at the upper end of expectations, after a sharp rise in 
the number of business passengers.

It
said around 45 per cent of winter seats are already booked - about the 
same level as last year - but warned that weak consumer confidence 
across Europe will slow the rate at which higher costs can be passed on 
to passengers.

The 
record profits for the group came after it offset a £100 million 
increase in its fuel bill by focusing on cost controls and improved 
customer satisfaction levels. Its on-time performance improved by 13 
percentage points to 79 per cent.

But
the group warned the macro-economic environment remains challenging, 
while it is facing higher costs, including increased taxation and a £220
million rise in its fuel costs.

As a result it is taking a 'cautious 
approach' to expanding its fleet, which will lead to unchanged capacity 
in the first half of its financial year and growth of around 4 per cent 
for the year as a whole.

Ryanair has already begun allocating seats - and charging extra for the front rows

It
expects first-half passenger revenues to increase by 'mid-single 
digits', helped by higher bag charges and other ancillary revenues.

The group announced payments to shareholders of £195million, which is about £5million more than previously expected amid pressure from its founder Sir Stelios Haji-Ioannou, who along with his family is a major shareholder.

The Luton-based airline has been expanding its appeal to business customers, which tend to provide higher profits, by flying more to business routes and offering flexible fares.

Passengers travelling on business routes increased by one million to 9.5 million in the year.

Total revenues rose 16 per cent to £3.5 billion while revenues per seat were up 3.4 per cent to £55.27, helped by a rise in ancillary revenues.

Douglas McNeill, an analyst at Charles Stanley Securities, said Carolyn McCall's first full year in charge had been a good one.

But he added: 'Cost inflation looks to be greater than we had thought and pricing isn't strong enough to compensate - the upshot is that our full-year 2012 forecasts may have to be reduced.'
