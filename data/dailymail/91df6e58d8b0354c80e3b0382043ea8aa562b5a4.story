We spend between eight and nine hours at work a day, amounting to a third of our entire lifetime taken up by our job.

So, it's nice to love what you do and make your job work for you, according to motivational speaker, former soldier and best-selling author Chris Barez-Brown.

Barez-Brown has spent 15 years helping businesses such as Nike, HSBC, Sony and Coca-Cola develop and founded his own leadership programme, Upping Your Elvis.

Sleeping at work could boost your career and make you better at work, says Chris Barez-Brown, whose new book promises to help you love your job and make it work for you

In short, if anyone knows about making your job work for you, it's him - and he's got some controversial ideas about how your job should be the happiest part of your day, not something to dread.

You hate your job, now what?Whilst it’s easy to confuse a ‘bad work week’ with ‘I hate my job,’ you can make it work for you. ‘People may think getting a new job is the answer but often what we’ve got is good, we haven’t just shaped it,' Barez-Brown tells MailOnline. 'What you can do to make that job perfect for you? Applying and taking interviews for other jobs  helps you get noticed, hone in your brand and clarify what you’re good at. You might find your dream job, you might realize how good your current job is. There are always opportunities.’

Take a break (a proper one) Whilst dozing off under your desk might seem lazy – or downright peculiar – Barez-Brown says lunchtime naps could be the key to productivity. ‘Hundreds of years ago, we had two proper sleeps, generally one on late afternoon and one at night as we do now,’ he explains. ‘There’s so much research that says our bodies work better like this. Naps are very restorative.’ It might seem extreme, but forward-thinking companies are cottoning on to the lunchtime snooze. ‘Semco have a hammock-garden, Google have nap pods and I used to work in an agency which had beds in the office,’ says Barez-Brown. 'It's absolutely the way forward.'

Read a book at your deskYour desk should be a place you look forward to turning up to. Consider getting in a little early to read at your desk before starting the working day. ‘We can become so factory-like we lose humanity,’ says Barez-Brown. ‘Switch your attention off work. It’s important to leave your desk regularly for breaks, but equally important to make your work space not just about work, but recreation as well. Reading a novel is a great way to do this.’

Work on your feetThink the biggest threat in your workplace is the questionable canteen milk? Think again. ‘Being sedentary causes more diseases than smoking, according to a study last year,’ says Barez-Brown, whose own ‘standing desk’ -  that’s a raised computer on a shelf, head piece for a phone and plenty of leg room – might be the next big thing in offices. ‘It’s so much healthier and more stimulating,’ he says. ‘Offices used to be about function and necessity, but now are about making the office fit around the job and work for what we need, which is tapping into our creative genius and communicating constantly.

Help your boss help you'A good boss is emotive, humble, takes risks and celebrates individuality,’ says Barez-Brown. If your boss still isn’t stepping up? ‘Call a meeting with them where you identify the problem you have, work on what is impacting the negativity and discuss what can be done about it. Their job is to make you feel brilliant. Be brave enough to take a risk and have a grown-up conversations with your boss. That's the only way you'll engage with them.'

And when you REALLY need to rantDon’t do it at work or with colleagues. ‘Find a safe buddy,’ says Barez-Brown. A friend who has nothing to do with your job who will listen and let you vent. Most of the time we just need to get stuff off our chest and in this case venting can be healthy and useful.’ But to do so in the work environment isn’t just negative, it’s potentially career-damaging, too. ‘People will associate you with complaining, it doesn’t bode well,’ says Barez-Brown.
