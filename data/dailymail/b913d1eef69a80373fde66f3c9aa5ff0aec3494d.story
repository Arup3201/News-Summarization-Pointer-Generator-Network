The wife of Manchester United striker Radamel Falcao may still be getting used to life in England, but the Premier League's newest WAG  makes sure she finds time to indulge in her love of music.

Falcao tweeted an Instagram photo of Lorelei Taron being filmed while sitting at a grand white piano, and the Colombian international added: 'Just wonderful.'

It comes as Sportsmail reveal Falcao has Yorkshire roots and that his dad once tried to get his then-teenage son a British passport.

Taron writes on her official website that she married Falcao at the age of 19 and has 'since lived in several cities, but never abandoned her musical studies'. 

The Argentinian has been in New York this week and will be glad her  husband opened his account at Old Trafford before the international break with a goal against Everton.

It took the 28-year-old four games to get off the mark but the former Atletico Madrid and Porto star was able to score his first  under Louis van Gaal at the Theatre of Dreams in their 2-1 win.

Up next for Falcao and Co is West Brom away, before Jose Mourinho's Chelsea pay a visit.
