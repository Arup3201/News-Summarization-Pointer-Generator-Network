The Milwaukee Bucks drew first blood against the New York Knicks ahead of their meeting in London in January with a 117-113 win on Tuesday.

Guided by 20 points from forward Ersan Ilyasova, the Bucks clinched victory against a Knicks team they will face at a sold-out O2 Arena on January 15.

It was Milwaukee's sixth win in their opening 11 games, but defeat for the Knicks consigned them to their ninth reverse in 12.

The Bucks will head to New York to take on the Knicks for a second time this season at Madison Square Garden on January 4 before their meeting in London 11 days later.

Ilyasova was one of seven Bucks players in double figures while Carmelo Anthony led the way for the New York Knicks with 26 points.

Tim Hardaway Jnr added 24 points for New York while Iman Shumpert chipped in with 21, but it was in a losing effort for the Knicks as they fell further behind Atlantic Division leaders Toronto.

After a 30-30 opening period, the Knicks will be rueing a poor second quarter in which they scored just 19 points and conceded 36.

And despite their best efforts in the second half and down the stretch, the Knicks were unable to claw their way back.

Another problem for the Knicks is that their scoring machine Anthony is playing with a sore left knee.

Anthony returned to the locker room for a couple of minutes in the second quarter to get it re-taped. The 30-year-old said he aggravated his already sore knee after hitting the floor while scrambling for a loose ball.

'I've had some tests. I really don't know exactly what's going on with it - I mean, I know what's going on with it,' Anthony said. 'But like I said, for me it's just a matter of just not kind of thinking about and playing through it.

'The tape job that I had kind of got wet a little bit. I started feeling it a little bit after that. We cut the tape off on the bench and I just started feeling a little bit more pain. It felt better once I got it re-taped.'

Knicks head coach Derek Fisher added: 'We played a lot of games in a short time and you know Melo's obviously carrying a big load. I’m sure he'll be OK. We'll keep an eye on him and make sure he's good though.' 

The Bucks will head to New York next to take on the Brooklyn Nets, where head coach Jason Kidd will face his former team, while the Knicks visit the Minnesota Timberwolves.
