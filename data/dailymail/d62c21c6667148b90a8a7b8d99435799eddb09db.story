Nigel Farage was left reeling today after losing three election candidates in less than 24 hours.

The Ukip leader was left 'deeply shocked' after suspending MEP Janice Atkinson over allegations that her staff had concocted bogus expenses claims.

Hours later the party confirmed a second senior figure, the party's candidate for Scunthorpe Stephen Howd, had been suspended following an 'alleged incident at his workplace'. 

The final blow came when the party's candidate for Westmorland and Lonsdale, Jonathan Stanley, sensationally quit claiming he was sick of the 'open racism and bullying' in the party.

The Ukip leader said he was 'deeply shocked' with Janice Atkinson after a member of her staff was secretly filmed apparently trying to obtain an inflated invoice for a drinks reception in a bid to claim the money from the EU

The triple blow came after detectives were brought in to investigate the allegations that Mrs Atkinson's chief of staff Christine Hewitt was secretly filmed apparently trying to obtain an inflated invoice for a drinks reception in a bid to claim the money from the EU.

A police spokesman said the Kent and Essex serious crime directorate was investigating the alleged fraud.

Mrs Atkinson, an MEP for the South East, has now been axed as the party's candidate for Folkestone and Hythe in May’s election.

The MEP had hosted a women’s fringe event – attended by Nigel Farage’s wife Kirsten – during Ukip’s spring conference in Margate, Kent, last month.

The reception, where guests drank champagne, Bellini cocktails and dozens of bottles of wine, allegedly cost £950 and was paid by Mrs Hewitt on a credit card.

But 24 hours later, it is claimed, Miss Hewitt returned to the restaurant and asked the manager to give her an invoice for £3,150 so she could claim back a larger amount from Brussels. 

She was allegedly filmed telling an undercover reporter from The Sun: ‘The idea is we overcharge them slightly because that’s the way of repatriating [the money].’

Mr Farage this morning attacked Mrs Atkinson and the member of staff over the ploy. He told LBC: ‘I was deeply shocked when I saw it. I thought it was one of the most incredibly stupid and dishonest things I’ve even seen in my life.

‘This was a member of staff. Exactly what the relationship between the member of staff and the asking of the false bill and Janice Atkinson I don’t know. We’ve suspended Janice Atkinson and we will hold a disciplinary hearing as soon as possible.'

Ostentatious breastfeeding

Farage: 'It isn't too difficult to breastfeed a baby in a way that isn't ostentatious.'

Immigrants causing traffic jams

Farage: 'It took me six hours and 15 minutes in the car to get here. It should have taken three-and-half to four.

'That has nothing to do with professionalism. What is does have to do with is a country in which the population is going through the roof, chiefly because of open door immigration and the fact the M4 is not as navigable as it used to be.'

General secretary sex scandal

Ukip general secretary Roger Bird suspended over allegations of impropriety with candidate Natasha Bolter in December. He claimed they slept together, she denied it. Doubts later emerged about her CV, with Oxford denying she studied there and questions about her teaching qualifications

Rate an immigrant game

A Ukip game emerged last year asking supporters to rate 'blacks, Muslims and Eastern Europeans' in a game – with prizes of cash and a Ukip golf umbrella.

Weeding out the lunatics

Ukip candidates chief David Soutter revealed he spent half his time 'weeding out the lunatics, the people who shouldn't be there.'

Candidate quits over 'poofter' comments

Kerry Smith was forced to quit as Ukip candidate in South Basildon and East Thurrock in December after being taped mocking gay party members as 'poofters', joking about shooting people from Chigwell in a 'peasant hunt' and referring to someone as a 'Chinky bird'.

Taking money from Brussels

Ukip secures a £1.5 million pot of taxpayers' cash by forming a new European-wide political party.

The Ukip leader added: ‘It would be mistake for me to pre-judge this but on the evidence of what that member of staff did, it does not look good.’

He said he had asked her ‘what on earth is going on’ when he called but did not get a clear answer. Mr Farage said: ‘They have asked a commercial enterprise to do something which is against the law.

‘I was shocked I simply couldn’t believe we could potentially find ourselves in this position.’

Mrs Atkinson who last year caused outrage after she called a Thai woman constituent a ‘ting tong’, had been due to stand the general election.

But a Ukip spokesman said last night: ‘The party is incredibly disappointed with Ms Atkinson, who appears to have exercised extremely poor judgment in acting in a way that the party has never, and would never condone.'

The spokesman added: 'The party has acted swiftly and immediately, and just as we showed when we suspended another MEP for financial irregularities, we always maintain a zero-tolerance attitude towards acts of this nature.’

Mr Farage, a candidate for nearby Thanet South, told the Telegraph last night: ‘If what she has been suspended for is right, I am astonished she could have done something quite so stupid. 

'It looks like a claim that wasn’t made, I am pleased to say, but a claim that was intended to be made that may not have been as genuine as perhaps it should have been.’

It is understood Mrs Atkinson and Miss Hewitt have been reported to Kent Police and the EU anti-fraud office. Mrs Farage is not thought to have been aware of the incident and is not accused of any wrongdoing.

Mrs Atkinson was elected as an MEP last year after joining Ukip in 2011. On top of a salary of close to £80,000, she is able to claim for expenses from the public purse.

The 52-year-old found herself in trouble last year after she was recorded by TV cameras calling the wife of a Ukip supporter ‘a ting tong from somewhere’. She insisted the comments were naive rather than malicious and said she was ‘incredibly sorry’ for offending the woman.

In December it emerged that she owed more than £2,000 in child support to her ex-husband, despite previously criticising ‘feckless families’ who have more children than they can afford. 

She has also been pictured sticking up her middle finger to a camera and was accused of swearing at protesters.

Folkestone and Hythe is seen as a safe Conservative seat, although Mrs Atkinson was a high-profile candidate. 

The latest problem for Ukip came after Mr Farage renewed warnings that he expected a ‘very dirty, nasty’ election campaign and urged his party to ‘turn the other cheek’.

Mr Farage spoke in Rochester, Kent, where he welcomed former Medway Tory councillors Tom Mason and Vaughan Hewett to Ukip to stand in May's local elections.
