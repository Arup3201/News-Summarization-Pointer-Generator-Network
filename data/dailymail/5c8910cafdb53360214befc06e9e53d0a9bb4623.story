Great news for customers, but bad news for bar staff everywhere - scientists have created a barman robot that can serve waiting punters much faster and more fairly.

James, named after its creator, the Joint Action in Multimodal Embodied Systems programme, has a tablet computer for a head showing big, comic-style eyes used to establish eye 
contact with  customers.

James'
 mouth moves in sync with its speech and the one-armed metal body 
forming its torso is fixed behind the bar, where James accepts drink 
orders, reaches for the drink using its arm and a four-fingered hand and
 serves them to its customers.

When it comes to the service industries, 8 per cent believe alcohol will be served up by robotic bartenders in the near future, such as James, pictured, and 3 per cent claim robots will be cooking our food. While 4 per cent believe prostitutes will be replaced by robots

It can read a customer's body 
language to spot who needs to be served first, and who doesn't need or 
want a drink because they're not paying attention.

The
 robot's behaviour is based on an earlier study by Bielefeld University 
that found 90 per cent of customers deliberately face the bar.

By contrast, one in 15 customers 
looked at their wallets to signal that they would like to place an order
 while fewer than one in 25 customers gestured at the bartender, perhaps
 indicating that these are not as successful strategies.

Those not needing to quench their thirst subconsciously maintained a small distance to the bar and turned away from it by chatting to friends instead, signalling to staff that they did not want service, the scientists said.

Psychologist Sebastian Loth, from Bielefeld University,  claimed: 
'Effectively, the customers identify themselves as ordering and 
non-ordering people through their behaviour.'

The
 study, published in online journal Frontiers in Psychology, looked at 
recordings of customers at nightclubs in Edinburgh and Germany to 
analyse how their body language attracted the bar staff’s attention.

The findings formed part of pan-Europe research team that developed the bartending robot.

The aim is to advance technology so that James can display socially intelligent behaviour that humans take for granted in daily life.

Jan de Ruiter said: 'In order to respond appropriately to its customers the robot must be able to recognise human social behaviour.'

James should be able to understand users who have no prior knowledge about the robot and who have not been briefed in any way.

In the noisy environment of a night club, the system cannot rely on its language components alone so the robot learns how to interpret body language.

German researchers said busy bar staff choose customers to serve if they are standing facing the bar or are directly in front of them, instead of whether they have cash at the ready or are snapping their fingers

Professor Ruiter added: 'Currently, we are working on the robot’s ability to recognise when a customer is bidding for its attention, thus, we have studied the process of ordering a drink in real life.'

The robot requires a clear-cut definition of which signals indicate an order and which do not.

Without a proper definition, it will misinterpret its customers’ signals, which could annoy people by responding inappropriately to their behaviour.

The findings of the behavioral bar study were used to update James’ programming.

Dr Loth said: 'With the update, James only talks to people whose position and body posture clearly indicate that they wish to order a drink.

'Only if the system is certain that the customers would like to order a drink, James will respond in Received Pronunciation "How can I help you?" But cutting the queue is a no-go with James. It maintains the order of the customers by memorising who came first.'
