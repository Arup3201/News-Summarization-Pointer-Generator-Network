Move towards the centre: Rachel Reeves, the new shadow work and pensions secretary, said Labour would be 'tougher' on welfare

Senior Labour figures were accused last night of shifting their rhetoric towards the centre ground – but without changing any of their policies.

The debate centred on the key issues of free schools and welfare just days after leader Ed Miliband reshuffled his top team.

Blairites were axed and replaced with more Left-wing  figures in what MPs hailed as a ‘new dawn for socialism’.

But, in what appeared to be a bid to persuade voters the party has not lurched to the Left,  frontbenchers yesterday gave interviews suggesting a move towards the centre.

Rachel Reeves, new shadow work and pensions spokesman, claimed that Labour would be ‘tougher’ on welfare than the Tories.

She declared that claimants who turned down work would lose their benefits.

Miss Reeves added: ‘We have some really great policies...that show we are tough and will not allow people to linger on benefits, but also that we are fair.’

This earned her a written rebuke from Iain Duncan Smith, who holds the post in Cabinet.

He welcomed the change of tone but questioned if there had been any change of policy.

‘I was hoping you might explain exactly which of the many reforms you have personally voted against, you will now be in favour of?’ he said.

‘Will you reverse the benefit uprating limit? The housing benefit cap? The benefit cap?’

Tristram Hunt, new in the shadow 
education role, appeared to reverse his previous dismissal of free 
schools, which are set up by parents separate from local authority 
control.

The TV historian was asked in an interview about his earlier assessment that they were  a ‘vanity project for yummy mummies’.

He
replied: ‘I regret those comments because any parents, be they yummy 
mummies or faddy daddies, involved in the education of their children is
great.’

A Labour government would not close any free schools and would back parent-led academies, he pledged.

Mr Hunt said that there could be no return to all state schools being run by local authorities. He added he would happily send his children to a free school.

‘If you want to do that when we are in government, we will be on your side,’ he said. ‘There has been this perception that we would not be, and I want people to be clear that we are.’

But Mr Hunt later emphasised there were important differences between free schools and Labour’s parent-led academies, which would have to employ qualified teachers and could not be set up in areas with enough school places.

Despite his latest comments, a party source insisted that there had been no policy change.
