Santa Claus is getting his rest before spreading joy to children all over the world in ten days.

While his elves were busy at his workshop North Pole, Father Christmas managed to sneak in a trip to Hawaii and take it easy over the weekend.

St Nick was in a merry mood when he stopped by Waikiki Beach to greet tourists and locals at a beach hotel and sing the Hawaiian Christmas Song.

Instead of arriving in his usual sleigh, this two-and-a half minute video shows Santa Claus being paddled to shore in a canoe before being greeted with Hawaiian holiday cheer.

During his canoe ride the man dressed as St Nick managed to catch a wave and and throw up the 'hang loose' shaka hand gesture to surfers who cheered him on.

He shouted ‘Mele Kalikimaka’, a Hawaiian phrase meaning ‘Merry Christmas’.

When he made landfall he was greeted by a young girl who presented a miniature Santa doll and a young boy who offered a high five.

St Nick was then entertained by dancing hula girls under a clear Hawaiian sky at Outrigger Waikiki Beach Resort.
