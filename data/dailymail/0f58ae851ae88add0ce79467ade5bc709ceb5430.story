Britain is set to be battered by a new freak weather system that could bring 100mph winds and blizzards in the run up to Christmas, forecasters say.

A so-called Storm Emily could wreak havoc across much of the UK beginning from the middle of next week, potentially toppling trees and tearing off roof tiles.

Weather Channel forecasters are naming the storm after Wuthering Heights author Emily Bronte, who died 165 years ago next Thursday - the day the storm is expected to strike.

Meanwhile, the Met Office has issued a Yellow Warning for northern and western parts of the UK tonight, including Scotland and Northern Ireland, advising of possible travel disruption in those regions.

And looking forward to next week there is the chance that potentially strong winds could spread south and east, battering areas still recovering from the worst tidal floods for six decades.

The unsettled weather is being caused by several low pressure systems sweeping across the north Atlantic, between the British Isles and Iceland.

Poor visibility: This week parts of Britain were enveloped by a thick blanket of fog. Until Thursday though most of the South can expect mild south-westerly winds and temperatures of up to 14C

Met Office forecaster Emma Corrigan 
said this morning: 'Through today there's currently a low pressure 
system out to the north east that's why we have that strong wind warning
out today.

'Winds 
potentially up to 80 mph which could bring some disruption to travel and
outdoor activities. The winds do ease overnight but from tomorrow 
there's another low pressure area up to the north west.'

The location of the low weather system
to the north of the UK means that winds will blow in from the 
south-east, keeping temperatures fairly mild for now at least.

'Through
today there's potential for seeing up to 12C to 13C in the South,' said
Ms Corrigan. 'The coldest temperatures will be up in Scotland tonight, 
where temperatures could drop to freezing.'

Conditions are likely to remain unsettled throughout the week, but the most disruptive strong winds are likely to remain in the north and the west.

But by Thursday there is the potential for strong winds to spread south and east, perhaps picking up to gale force around coastal areas.

It could bring fresh misery for people there after last week two people died and thousands were evacuated from their homes after that region was swamped by a record-breaking tidal surge.

Weather Channel meteorologist Leon Brown told the Daily Mirror: 'From Thursday to Christmas there is a high risk of gales.

'At the moment there is a 30 to 40 per cent risk of severe gales for central and southern Britain on Thursday.

'Worst case is 70 to 90mph gusts across exposed parts of Wales and the south, but even 70mph gusts for central Britain would cause a lot of disruption.'

Jonathan Powell, forecaster for Vantage Weather Services, told the Daily Express: 'This weekend we are looking at winds of 70mph, but next week a much wider, deeper system could trigger gusts over 100mph.'
