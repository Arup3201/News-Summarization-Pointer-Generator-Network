Andrew Mitchell's daughter Hannah has spoken for the first time about the toll the 'Plebgate' allegations had taken on her father

The daughter of former Chief Whip Andrew Mitchell told yesterday of her family’s despair at how he was ‘stitched up’ over the Plebgate affair.

Hannah Mitchell spoke for the first time of the toll the allegations had taken on the Tory MP and why the unfolding saga has reinforced her belief in a free Press.

The 25-year-old doctor also claimed Downing Street had betrayed Mr Mitchell by stopping him telling the whole truth when he was accused of calling police officers ‘plebs’.

Dr Mitchell said that in the following weeks she, her mother Dr Sharon Bennett and sister Rosie had taken turns looking after the 57-year-old Sutton Coldfield MP, whom they feared to leave alone as he became ‘very withdrawn’.

On the BBC Radio 4 programme Broadcasting House she recalled the moment the family learnt of an email from PC Keith Wallis allegedly purporting to be a member of the public who had witnessed the altercation on September 19 last year. In his email Mr Wallis, a member of Scotland Yard’s diplomatic protection unit, claimed he was sightseeing when he heard the Cabinet minister use the words ‘f****** plebs’ at officers.

Dr Mitchell said: ‘I remember Dad shouted, “I’ve been stitched up.” 

‘I just remember sitting in the chair shaking, being certain that something really terrible was going on, and we would say this to people but no one would believe us. We knew from the word go that it was a conspiracy.’ 

After the story broke, Dr Mitchell drove her father to face the media in London. He had hoped to present his side of the story, but Downing Street forced him to issue a ‘completely different’ statement.

She said: ‘The press officers at No 10 were saying, “No, no you mustn’t, you don’t want to go into a firefight with police. Don’t deny it.”

‘So they kind of gave him this incredibly watered down statement which he then went out and gave and was absolutely shot down for.’

Dr Mitchell said that she, her mother Dr Sharon Bennett, left, and her sister Rosie had taken turns looking after the 57-year-old Sutton Coldfield MP, whom they feared to leave alone

Mr Mitchell was eventually forced to quit over the ‘toxic’ plebs phrase, which he hotly denies using.

Dr Mitchell said of her father: ‘I have known him always as being a kind, warm, generous character. This caricature came out of an arrogant Tory toff, somebody who was rude and abusive to people.

‘It was a really very difficult time for my family. My father was in a very, very bad way. The character assassination that was going on would have hurt the most robust person.’

She had been left ‘shaken’ by having reporters on her doorstep but added: ‘I’m a great advocate of the free Press and this hasn’t changed my mind. I feel very, very happy that we’ve had the opportunity to try to put our side of the story across, and people now appear to be starting  to realise that my dad was not the sinner in the situation.’

Sergeant Chris Jones, Inspector Ken MacKaill and Detective Sergeant Stuart Hinton have been accused of trying to discredit Mr Mitchell

Yesterday Sir Hugh Orde, the head of the Association of Chief Police Officers, called on three Police Federation representatives accused of giving misleading accounts about Mr Mitchell to apologise.

They claimed that Mr Mitchell had refused to say what happened when they met to discuss the incident.

Sir Hugh told the BBC’s Andrew Marr Show: ‘The officers’ standards of conduct fell below that required.’ 

The Crown Prosecution Service is expected to announce soon whether anyone will face criminal charges over the affair. 

Eight people have been arrested, including five Met Police officers.
