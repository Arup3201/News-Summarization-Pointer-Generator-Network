Still wallowing in shame from your festive diet of mulled wine and mince pies? Look away now.

Rosie Huntington-Whiteley, one of the world's most beautiful supermodels, has unveiled her Valentine's Day lingerie range for M&S and models it all herself, of course.

The 27-year-old shows no signs of a turkey tummy as she showcases her toned physique in the romantic campaign images.

In one shot, the model wears sultry smokey eye make-up and lacy black lingerie. In another, she plays with her hair as she shows off a pink twin-set.

While she sports her signature long hair in the campaign imagery, the star recently opted for a new long bob (or 'lob') hairdo.

The model enlisted the help of London-based hairdresser George Northwood and his sister Sally to colour her hair in time for the New Year. 

Writing on Twitter, Rosie said: 'Ready for 2015 equipped with a fresh new do! Thank you @georgenorthwood @sallynorthwood #BeThereOrHaveBadHair.'

She's just like us! Rosie Huntington-Whiteley doesn't deny herself the odd calorific treat - she loves pudding and the odd glass of wine

She may possess a goddess-like body that's made her one of the world's most famous models but Rosie Huntington-Whiteley doesn't deny herself the odd calorific treat.

The 27-year-old, who is currently fronting Coca Cola Life's new campaign, revealed that while she does swear by all things clean and lean, she allows herself sweet treats too.

'I'm travelling all the time so it's hard to find a balance and eat healthily. I really love my food - I'm always being tempted by room service and I eat out a lot - but I try and eat organic with natural ingredients,' she said.

'At home I cook as clean and healthy as possible, so when I'm out I can enjoy a pudding or a glass of wine and actually enjoy myself.'

She also revealed her favourite way to stay fit - dance classes where she can channel Beyonce.

The Devon-born model said: 'I love dance classes! I love Body by Simone - I go with my girlfriends, we all go and sweat our faces off and then have a healthy breakfast.

'You have to make it fun. I like to go to dance classes and feel like Beyoncé,' she said, adding that one of her favourite songs to work out to is Summer by Calvin Harris.

The fitness fanatic also works out with James Duigan, the man behind the hugely successful Clean & Lean empire.

Rosie met James several years ago and is such a fan that she penned the introduction to his book Clean & Lean: Flat Tummy Fast.

Rosie said: 'James knows exactly how I want my body to look: lean, taut and strong, yet soft, curvy and feminine.

'What I've learned through working with James is that by focusing on creating a healthy body you can really achieve all of these things, faster than I ever thought possible. Oh, and by the way, nobody can get a stomach as flat as James can!'

Rosie has long been a member of the M&S family and her lingerie range for Autograph has gone on to become one of the store's best-selling ranges.

The actress and model, who recently spoke of her desire to build a brand from her name, was unveiled as the face of Moroccanoil earlier this year.

Rosie is the haircare brand's first ever famous face and shows off her glossy, flowing hair in the new campaign imagery.

The model and actress is also gearing up to star in Mad Max: Fury Road alongside Charlize Theron, Nicholas Hoult, Zoe Kravitz and Tom Hardy and has a rumoured beauty range in the works.
