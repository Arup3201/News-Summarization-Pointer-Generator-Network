Southampton overhauling Chelsea and winning the Barclays Premier League is not beyond the realms of possibility, according to manager Ronald Koeman.

Many have speculated on Southampton’s ability to secure European football next season with a top four finish, but the Dutchman’s aspirations don’t rest there.

‘Nothing is impossible,’ said Koeman, when asked if he had one eye on league leaders Chelsea. ‘I’m not looking too much at the rest of the teams. Maybe only in the respect that I think I haven’t seen until now teams much better than us.’

Saints manager Ronald Koeman has refused to rule out talk of a title challenge from St Mary's

Victory over Leicester at St Mary’s consolidated their second position in the table. Southampton now sit four points behind Chelsea and seven clear of Swansea in fifth. Shane Long came off the bench and scored twice, in the 75th and 80th minutes, his first goals since his £12million summer move from Hull.

Ronald Koeman's 25-point haul from Southampton’s opening 11 games is the club’s best ever start to a top-flight campaign.

Some fans were singing ‘We’re going to win the league’ after witnessing an 11th win in 12 games in all competitions. It is starting to sound a little less tongue in cheek.

‘It’s good,’ said Koeman, ‘it’s a fantastic dream they can have about our team and everybody is enjoying how we are playing and how we are doing, and it’s the same for the technical staff.’ This was Southampton’s seventh clean sheet of the season and they never seriously looked like conceding.

Koeman praised defenders like Natanial Clyne (R) for racking up the best defensive record in the league

They have scored 12 unanswered in the league and have the best defensive record in the top four flights of English football.

Koeman said the defence is deserving of just as much praise as the individual attacking talents of Dusan Tadic and Graziano Pelle.

‘We have four very good defenders. Ryan Bertrand is playing fantastically at a very high level and it is not a surprise that Nathaniel Clyne has been selected for England.

‘Toby Alderweireld and Jose Fonte together as the centre-backs are fantastic.’

Ronald Koeman deserves nothing but praise for his work at Southampton but gets a Sportsmail thumbs-down for his less than natty attire...
