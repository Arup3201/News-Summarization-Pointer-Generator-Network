A woman whose neighbor broke into her home and attempted to rape and kill her, is suing the local police department for failing to protect her.

Savannah Fuchs of North Ogden, Utah, survived the attack on April 1, 2014, when Todd Alan Barber, 54, broke into the townhouse Fuchs shares with her six-year-old son in the early hours of the morning.

He entered her bedroom and she woke to find him standing there.

'[He had] a gun, bags and duct tape, and he had zip ties and he came in to rape me and kill me and my son. And I survived. There were so many miracles,' Fuchs said on Wednesday.

Barber held Fuchs hostage, at times firing his gun at her and pistol whipping her head and face. She later required 50 stitches and 60 staples.

Barber eventually called 911 himself and requested an ambulance and police.

When officers arrived he shot himself in the head inside Fuchs' home.

Fuchs said that the warning signs were there but North Ogden police had kept assuring her that it would be OK, and that they couldn't help her because Barber did not have a criminal record.

Robert Sykes, Fuchs' attorney, found in his research that in 1990 Barber was convicted in Georgia of possession of a firearm during a crime.

'[They] should have done their homework and found out about his record. That changes the whole game here,' he said.

He added that even if Barber couldn't have been arrested for harassment or trespassing, they shouldn't have kept reassuring Fuchs, but instead should have warned her to take steps to protect herself as she may be at risk.

City officials, responding to the civil lawsuit filed against the City of North Ogden and at least three police officers by Fuchs and her attorney, say that she was given options on how to deal with her neighbor, but she did not act on them.

North Ogden mayor, Brent Taylor, told KSL.com on Wednesday that his police department did nothing wrong and said his city is being 'dragged through the mud'.

'It's absolutely outrageous that Mr. Sykes and his client think that the citizens of North Ogden owe her a large cash payout for a terrible tragedy committed by an evil man. That's what frustrates me,' he said.

'I've reviewed the documents extensively, personally, that pertained to the case. And I feel our officers acted very responsibly, very professionally,' he said.

He cited one report in which an officer 'told Savannah she could get a protective order against Todd if she felt her or her son's safety was at risk'.

Taylor said that options were presented that she chose not to pursue, but admits that 'looking back, we could be critical of everyone's actions.

Fuchs has said that she didn't pursue the protective order because Barber lived in the adjoining townhouse sharing a dividing wall,so she was not sure it would have helped.

For nearly a year Fuchs endured harassment from her neighbor, much of which was religious in nature. Fuchs is Jewish and Barber, a Christian, would write Biblical passages in chalk on her porch.

He once climbed a ladder and put a Christian fish symbol on her bedroom window, and also scratched the symbol into her car.

In a report filed after the harrowing incident at Fuchs' home that led to Barber's suicide, officers noted that the messages were not threatening, just 'odd'. One message said: 'Pray for forgiveness'.

In April of 2013 Fuchs filed a report saying that she had seen Barber 'looking into her window at weird times of the day and night'.

She told police that she was afraid of him and wanted him to leave her alone.

On January 12, 2014, another report called Barber's harassment of Fuchs 'an ongoing problem' after she once again called police. The report said that Fuchs claimed to have called them six times regarding Barber, through police refute that having documented three calls.

Fuchs maintains that every time she contacted police they would speak to Barber and assure her that everything would be OK.

'They would come over and they would come into my house and they would sit down and we would talk and I would just kind of explain I didn't feel safe. And they would go next door and talk with him. And then they would come back and reassure me and let me know everything would be OK,' she said.

Things came to a head when Fuchs complained to their landlord who told Barber to move out. The day of his eviction was the day he broke into her house to murder her - April 1, 2014.

Speaking on Wednesday, Sykes said: 'This never would have happened had the police done their duty.'

Acknowledging that police are not usually liable for criminal conduct, he said that this case is different because of the 'special relationship' of trust that had developed between Fuchs and officers.

Taylor acknowledges that what happened was a tragedy and his heart goes out to all the victims.

Taylor said that this a case of 'an evil person [that] chose to do an evil crime' and was not the result of inaction by his police department.

Taylor added that the city will not seek any type of out-of-court settlement.
