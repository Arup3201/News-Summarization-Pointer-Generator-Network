Some players arrive like a whirlwind and then can’t follow it up in the second season. Stevan Jovetic took a season to bed in, but is now ready to make his impact.

I first saw him play for Montenegro against England; he’s an allrounder. Quick, athletic, bright around the ball. 

He will go past a defender and he can score goals. Not playing at the World Cup has helped him. He looks on fire.

Star man: Jovetic scores his first of two goals as he explodes into life this season for Manchester City

Improved: Jovetic had a tough first season marred by injury, but he has all the attributes to succeed in England

Stevan's stunner: How Jovetic scored his superb second goal against Liverpool

Already a trip to Spurs in August is looking a key game for Liverpool. That’s where they go next and they need to get a result.

They can’t afford to let City and Chelsea get too far away.

A £45million star with a £16million fee

You have got to admire the confidence of Brendan Rodgers. Jose Mourinho, Roberto Mancini and Cesare Prandelli couldn’t turn Mario Balotelli, but the Liverpool manager believes he can.

I’m going through the full circle of emotions on this: people say he is a cheap buy for £16m when you think Shane Long cost Southampton £12m, but he’s only cheap if he succeeds.

Watching on: Liverpool missed a striker of Balotelli's class tonight, but his behaviour will have to be managed

Milan have dumped him a for a reason. His attitude sucks and Liverpool have built their progress on teamwork. 

On talent alone, he’s a £45m player. It certainly won’t be quiet with him around.

It's not all about Chelsea

It must be a nightmare for a defender. You are given a chasing by Edin Dzeko and Jovetic... and then on comes Sergio Aguero. 

The little magician now has two goals in two games from the bench. 

Last night, City had Aguero, Fernandinho, Kolarov and Milner on the bench. I wonder if too many people have been too quick to hand Chelsea the title this season.

Qaulity: Sergio Aguero ends the game as a contest just 23 seconds after coming on as a substitute

The bench boys: Aguero was one of a host of stars on the City bench and his impact was instant

You just have to adore Zabaleta 

When we talk about the foundation of the modern Manchester City, it is easy to focus on the mighty Vincent Kompany. But Pablo Zabaleta is a warrior too. 

When they lifted the title last season, he got the biggest cheer and the supporters adore his appetite and passion. 

Passion: Manchester City have been built around Vincent Kompany and Pablo Zabaleta, who the fans love

Signed by Mark Hughes for around £6m, he has been a brilliant capture.

If you have a child who wants to be a footballer, get him to watch Zabaleta. He doesn’t play thinking about what car he’s going to buy. He plays to win.
