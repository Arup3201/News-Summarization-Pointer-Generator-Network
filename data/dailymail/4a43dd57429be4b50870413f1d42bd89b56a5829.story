A tiny, remote-controlled camera has been lowered into an early Mayan tomb that has been sealed for 1,500 years.

Extraordinary footage of the tomb at the Palenque archaeological site in southern Mexico revealed an apparently intact funeral chamber with red frescoes, pottery and pieces of a funerary shroud made of jade and mother of pearl.

It also showed a series of nine figures depicted in black on a vivid, blood-red background.

Archaeologists say the images from one of the earliest ruler's tombs found at Palenque will shed new light on the early years of the once-great city state.

Palenque was a Maya city state in what is now the Mexican state of Chiapas

The National Institute of 
Anthropology and History said archaeologists have known about the tomb 
since 1999, but have been unable to enter it because the pyramid 
standing above it is unstable and breaking into the chamber could damage
 the murals.

It said 
the floor appears to be covered with detritus and it is not immediately 
evident in the footage if the tomb contains recognisable remains.

But archaeologist Martha Cuevas said the jade and shell fragments seen on the video are 'part of a funerary costume'.

The
 chamber was found in a heavily-deteriorated pyramid complex known as 
the Southern Acropolis, in a jungle-covered area of Palenque not far 
from the Temple of Inscriptions, where the tomb of a later ruler, Pakal,
 was found in the 1950s.

While
 Pakal's tomb featured a famous and heavily carved sarcophagus, no such 
structure is seen in the footage of the tomb released yesterday.

The
 institute said in a statement that 'it is very probable that the 
fragmented bones are lying directly on the stones of the floor'.

But Dr Cuevas said the discovery shed
 new light on early rulers, and its proximity to other burial sites 
suggested the tomb may be part of a funerary complex.

'All this leads us to consider that the Southern Acropolis was used as a royal necropolis during that period,' she said.

Susan Gillespie, an associate professor of anthropology at the University of Florida who was not involved in the project, said 'this is an important find for Palenque and for understanding Early Classic Maya history and politics'.

This was in part, she explained, because the later rulers who made the city-state larger tended to build atop their predecessors' temples and tombs, making it hard to get at them.

'Palenque was a relatively important western Maya capital in the Early Classic, but with the build-up during the time of Pakal and some of his successors, those accomplishments were buried and thus difficult to assess, buried literally by Late Classic structures atop Early Classic ones,' Gillespie said.

The later rulers wrote almost obsessively about Palenque's history in long stone inscriptions, but Gillespie noted that 'finding archaeological confirmation of the earlier kings has been extremely difficult'.

The tomb's floor occupies about five square metres with a low, Mayan-arch roof of overlapping stones. Experts say it probably dates to between 431 and 550 AD, and could contain the remains of K'uk' Bahlam I, the first ruler of the city-state.

The tomb's existence was revealed by a shaft found near the top of the ruined pyramid, leading downward. But it was too narrow to provide any kind of view of the chamber.

In late April, researchers lowered the tiny 2in-long camera into the tomb using the 6in-wide shaft.

While the general public had not seen images of the interior of the tomb, video of it was made after the chamber was detected in 1999, noted David Stuart, a specialist in Mayan epigraphy at the University of Texas at Austin.

The images had circulated among researchers and been posted on the internet, and Dr Stuart said that some evidence suggests the tomb "is the burial of a noted female ruler of Palenque named Ix Yohl Ik'nal, based on the date and on the identities of ancestral figures painted on the walls.'

'The female ruler is mentioned in a number of the historical texts of the site,' he wrote.

It would not be the first tomb of a female noble found at Palenque - in 1994, archaeologists found the tomb of a woman dubbed The Red Queen because of the red pigment covering her tomb.

But it has never been established that she was a ruler of Palenque, and her tomb dates from a later period, between 600 and 700 AD.
