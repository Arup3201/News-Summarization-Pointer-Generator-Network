She dreamed a dream, and it’s about to come true.

Susan Boyle is to continue her remarkable rise from obscurity to international superstardom by becoming the first British artist to record a posthumous duet with Elvis Presley.

The King of Rock ’n’ Roll and the Scottish singing phenomenon known as ‘SuBo’ will be heard together on O Come, All Ye Faithful.

It is the first track of Boyle’s forthcoming album, Home For Christmas, which will be released in November.

Boyle, 52, was granted permission to use recordings of Presley by his Graceland estate earlier this year.

She joins an exclusive list of singers, including Celine Dion, who have been allowed to posthumously duet with him.

Boyle’s Christmas album also includes renditions of Little Drummer Boy and a duet with Johnny Mathis of When A Child Is Born.

She said: ‘Christmas is still my favourite time of the year – I have fond memories of family Christmases growing up.

‘To be able to put a unique twist on classic Christmas songs is truly wonderful.

'To sing with Elvis, well I didn’t think it would be possible – isn’t technology brilliant?

‘I grew up with Elvis playing in my home. My father was a huge fan. This song is for him and his love of Elvis.’

Presley released O Come, All Ye Faithful in 1971 and producers have used technology to harmonise his voice with Boyle’s.

The singer performed at Windsor Castle during the Queen’s Diamond Jubilee and last year sang with her idol Donny Osmond in Las Vegas – a meteoric rise for the shy woman from Blackburn, West Lothian, who wowed judges by singing I Dreamed A Dream on Britain’s Got Talent in April 2009.
