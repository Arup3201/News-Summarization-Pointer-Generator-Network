Stevenage boss Graham Westley has revealed police are looking into an accusation from defender Ronnie Henry that he was bitten on the hand by Dagenham midfielder Joss Labadie in their 1-0 home defeat on Saturday.

Labadie served a 10-match ban and was fined £2,000 in March 2014 for biting Chesterfield's Ollie Banks in a League Two match while playing for Torquay - a charge which he denied.

Westley claimed Henry was 'horrified' by Saturday's alleged incident which happened shortly before full-time and said: 'I think it has become a police matter and when it becomes a police matter anybody in a responsible position should let it be dealt with by the authorities.

'So in passing comment, word is around the place that there's been an incident and the police are involved. He's (Henry) not in a good situation, he's in the treatment room and he's suffered quite a nasty injury.

'Ronnie was in a state of shock, you don't go on a football pitch expecting to lose your finger and Ronnie was horrified by what has gone on because it's a football match and he's nearly lost his finger.'

The game had already threatened to boil over before Labadie and Henry's clash due to the nature of Dagenham's winning goal.

Labadie was clearly offside when a long ball was played forwards in his direction yet he did not touch it, Christian Doidge took over and crossed for Dean Howell to score.

But only after long consultation with his assistant did referee Dean Whitestone award the goal.

In November 2010, Luis Suarez was handed a seven-match ban by the Dutch FA and a fine by his then-club Ajax for biting PSV Eindhoven's Otman Bakkal.

Suarez then bit Chelsea's Branislav Ivanovic - his second victim - and the FA charged the then-Liverpool striker with violent conduct. He received a 10-game ban and a fine from his club.

Then, Suarez was found guilty of biting Italy defender Giorgio Chiellini at the 2014 World Cup. 

The Barcelona forward was banned from all 'football-related activities' for four months and received a nine international match suspension.
