It has been revealed that the elderly woman whose nursing home ordered in a stripper had also arranged a trip to Hooters for their male residents.

The drama over the decision by supervisors at a Long Island nursing home to allow a male stripper to put on a show came after they reportedly took a host of the male residents to a local Hooters.

No further details about the Hooters trip have been revealed but TMZ alleges that it prompted some resentment from the female residents, which led to the September 2012 show.

Risky business: The son of Bernice Youngblood (seen putting money in a stripper's underwear) was shocked when he arrived at her nursing home in Long Island to find this picture from a September 2012 strip show

A lawyer for the nursing home said that a 16-member resident committee had requested the September 2012 performance and the nursing home paid the $250 fee.

TMZ claims that a now-dead female member of the committee was the one to push the stripper proposal through their voting process.

Lawyer Howard Fensterman said that in spite of the lawsuit's claims that the strip tease defiled Bernice Youngblood, the 85-year-old Alzheimer's patient pictured tucking dollar bills in the stripper's underwear, she was not the only one enjoying the plaintiff in the lawsuit, was not the only one who was happy about the event.

'They welcomed it, and it looks like they had a good time,' the nursing home's attorney told The New York Post.

The salacious event came to light when one of Mrs Youngblood's sons found a picture of her with the stripper among her belongings.

The family complained not only about the striptease show, but about the fact that Mrs Youngblood's money was supposed to be locked safely away.

They held a press conference outside the home Tuesday, which the woman's son Franklin Youngblood attended.

He said he immediately went to a nursing supervisor for an explanation after finding the photo. The lawsuit claims the nurse attempted to snatch the photo from him.

The suit said: ‘Plaintiff Bernice Youngblood was placed in apprehension of imminent, offensive, physical harm, as she was confused and bewildered as to why a muscular, almost nude man, was approaching her and placing his body and limbs, over [her] and directing [her] to place her hands about and upon his body, including his genital area, without [her] consent.'

It continued: ‘Hiring male strippers to perform for the defendant’s nursing-home patients was a serial occurrence.

‘Bernice Youngblood has lived 85 years as a traditional Baptist, hard-working, lady... And now she has been defiled.'

Fensterman said the East Neck Nursing Center's management reserves the right to reject a request by the residents' committee, particularly if the activity were deemed detrimental.

'But in this instance these are adults who wanted to have this activity, they requested it, they voted on it and the nursing home approved of it,' he said.
