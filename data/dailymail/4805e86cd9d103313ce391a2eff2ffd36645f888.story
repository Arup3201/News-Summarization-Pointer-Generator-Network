A retired police officer took drastic action to protect himself and his own pet from his neighbour's dog by smashing it repeatedly over the head before stabbing it to death.

Former Scotland Yard homicide detective Barry Costello, 55, says he killed the large bull terrier cross when it climbed over his fence and attacked him and his dog Troy.

Mr Costello has said he had no option but to hack Monty to death in his kitchen, but his owners say they are 'very upset' and police are now investigating what happened.

Stabbing: Former Scotland Yard homicide detective Barry Costello says his neighbour's dog attacked him and his pet Troy so he hacked it to death

Accusations: Monty was described a being 'possessed' and a 'monster' but his bereft owners have claimed there is no indication there was a struggle on Wednesday

Weapons: Mr Costello used these kitchen knives to stab the large bull terrier cross to death in his home

The incident unfolded on Wednesday when the dog climbed into Mr Costello's garden.

He says he ran back into his house but his own pet Troy came out to protect him and the neighbour's animal grabbed it by the throat.

The father-of-three then lifted two terracotta paving slabs from his patio and beat it over the head and when the fight spilled into the kitchen he grabbed a small vegetable knife and stabbed its back so many times the blade broke. 

He then got a bigger knife and stabbed him until the 'massive' white animal was dead.

Mr Costello, of South Croydon, London, who worked for the Serious Organised Crime Agency and the homicide squad at the Metropolitan Police, said he had no choice.

He said: 'All of a sudden, I could see this head poking over the fence - it was about the size of a lion's.

'It climbed over the fence and then started towards me. I could see it was going to attack me because it was coming at me with such force so I ran towards the house.

'I couldn't believe it when Troy just turned up out nowhere and totally intercepted the attack - getting mauled in the process.

'The dog was trying to rip Troy apart - it just went straight for the throat with its fangs and began biting.

Gripe: The former detective says he saw the dog's head look over the fence before the alleged struggle

Death: After he smashed Monty repeatedly over the head the fight spread into the kitchen where the dog died

Violent: The terrier was stabbed with such force that the knife's blade broke in its chest

'Troy tried to defend himself but it was clear the dog wasn't going to let go, so I picked up this massive paving slab and smashed it over the dog's back three times.

'Any other dog would've died but this one just kept going like it was possessed or something - the monster didn't even flinch.

Brave: Troy rushed to defend his master, who says his dog would have certainly died had he not intervened

'It just pulled Troy into the kitchen by his throat - leaving scrape marks on the floor - and I followed behind trying to figure out what to do.

'I hit the dog again with a paving slab, which smashed into three pieces, and got worried because it didn't do anything so grabbed a vegetable knife with a four inch blade.

'I just kept thinking 'this dog is going to kill Troy and then me' so I stabbed it about three or four times in the chest but the knife just snapped in half.'

Mr Costello added: 'The whole thing must have only lasted for about five minutes but it felt like a lifetime because we were fighting for our lives - it might as well been a human who had come in.

'I was in a state of absolute shock. I spent 30 years on the police force and was in the murder squad for half of that and I have never been so terrified in my life and also never felt so alone.

'Thank God Troy was there because that monster would have killed me. The dog had to be killed in order for me to get help. I was completely and utterly terrified.'

Just days before the attack on Wednesday, the dog - which Barry says is five times bigger than a normal Staffie - had already jumped into the garden and attacked Rottweiller Troy.

Following the second attack Barry was left almost unharmed but his dog Troy received puncture wounds to his neck and side from bite marks.

Dorothy Murray, whose grandson Regan Kelly owned the dog, said: 'We are all in complete shock.

'Monty was being used as a guard dog, which we didn't like so we rescued it about two years ago.

'On Wednesday, the dog just obviously got into the garden again and the man stabbed him.

'My grandson went berserk when we found out. There was no barking or any others signs to indicate there had been a struggle.

'Our dog might attack a cat or a dog like any pet might but you don't expect your neighbour to kill it. It's chilling really and we're very upset.'

Damage: The former Scotland Yard officer smashed the dog over the head with tiles before stabbing it - sending blood over his home in Crowdon

The Metropolitan Police today confirmed they are investigating the incident.

A spokesman said: 'Police were called on Wednesday 28 May, at approximately 12:15hrs to an address in Croydon to reports of an incident involving two dogs.

'It is believed that a dog came into the victim's back garden over a neighbour's fence.

'The victim - a man in his 50s - went inside his house, but his own dog has then become involved in a fight with the other dog.

'The victim tried to separate the dogs and has stabbed the dog (not his own dog), which later died.

'Police were called and the dog has been taken for examination to establish its breed-type. Enquiries continue. No arrests have been made at this stage.'
