An NC State player directed some pretty sour words at President Obama after the eighth-seeded Wolfpack advanced to the Sweet 16 with a win over the No. 1 Villanova Wildcats on Saturday night.

NC State's Anthony 'Cat' Barber appeared to curse at the president while addressing his teammates in the locker room following the squad's unexpected 71-68 victory. 

President Obama had picked Villanova to defeat NC State and advance all the way to the NCAA title game before ultimately falling to undefeated Kentucky.

NC State's win over No. 1 seed Villanova busted Obama's bracket as he had the Wildcats going to the final 

While the team was huddled up in the locker room after the win, Barber questioned why President Obama picked against the Wolfpack. 

He appeared to say: 'What the f**k [is] wrong with Barack Obama?'

Obama did have the NC State-Villanova matchup correct on his bracket.

It doesn't really matter, because the Wolfpack are back in the Sweet 16.

Forward BeeJay Anya said: 'We came out today with the feeling that everybody expected us to lose to a one seed.

'But we believe in ourselves and that we're good enough to beat anybody in the country and we went down and did it.' 

Villanova saw its 16-game winning streak end and the team has not reached the second weekend since 2009

It was a huge win for the eighth-seeded Wolfpack and they will move on to the Sweet 16 in Syracuse, New York

President Obama has been releasing his bracket for seven straight years. 

He has only selected the correct tournament winner once.

The POTUS predicted the North Carolina Tar Heels would win the NCAA title in 2009 and they delivered. 

If Kentucky wins it all this year, it will be the second time President Obama picked the big winner of the Big Dance correctly. 

President Obama has  only selected the correct tournament winner once in six previous public attempts 

After Saturday's win, Barber and backcourt mate Desmond Lee shared a long embrace as their teammates danced around the court in celebration.

He turned to Lee, pounded his chest and yelled: 'All heart!'

The 20-year-old guard had 13 points, three rebounds and three assists in the win.

Barber got the nickname 'Cat' when he was a child after his sister Pam noticed his quick moves, according to MaxPreps.  

The Wolfpack (22-13) have designs on their own big March run and will move on to Syracuse, New York to play the winner of the Louisville-Northern Iowa game.

Trevor Lacey led them with 17 points and Abdul-Malik Abu had 13 points, 12 rebounds and absolutely destroyed the Wildcats inside.

Coach Mark Gottfried said 'We respect Villanova, but we've seen good teams.

'We've seen a lot of them in our conference. 

'You see them about every night. So a league like that prepares you for games like tonight.'

NC State has wins over Duke, North Carolina and Louisville in ACC play.  

Villanova lost after storming their way to pair of Big East titles and a 41-point victory in the NCAA Tournament

Villanova (33-3) saw a 16-game winning streak end and the team has not reached the second weekend since 2009.

The Wildcats come up empty after storming their way to pair of Big East titles and a 41-point victory in the NCAA Tournament opener.

Coach Jay Wright said: 'I know we have to answer to the fact that we did not get to the second weekend again.

'We have to own that. 

'But it's not going to define us within our program. 

'It's going to define us outside of our program and we accept that.'
