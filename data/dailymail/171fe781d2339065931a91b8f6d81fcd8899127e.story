It is 10 years to the day since Wayne Rooney, an 18-year-old tyro with the world at his feet, made his unforgettable debut for Manchester United in a Champions League fixture with Fenerbahce at Old Trafford.

Many believed the £25.6m transfer fee would weigh heavily on Rooney's young but stocky shoulders but he confounded the doubters with a stunning hat-trick in a 6-2 win.

On the anniversary, we take a look back at how Rooney's debut was reported by Sportsmail at the time.

REPORT BY MATT LAWTON AT OLD TRAFFORD 

The shirt he wore at the end belonged to Fenerbahce but the fans who applauded on an enchanted European evening had already identified a legend in Manchester United red. Wayne Rooney had arrived, and in some style.

Old Trafford witnessed something magical last night, an opening performance as memorable as any ever seen at their Theatre of Dreams.

Not even Sir Bobby Charlton enjoyed a debut like this. Two goals had marked his first league match as an 18-year-old against, well, Charlton. Rooney went one better.

He scored three.

The matchday programme

Sir Alex Ferguson has dared to compare Rooney to Eric Cantona but already that does not do him justice.

Cantona never excelled like this in the Champions League. This was Best against Benfica, Charlton at Wembley. When Cantona joined from Leeds, he started as a substitute against Manchester City.

United were pleading poverty on the eve of this contest but they are richer for the £30million they agreed to pay Everton last month. They have Rooney, as exciting a player Ferguson has seen in 30 years - and United have seen in 40. 

Roy Keane said he was the only English player he would pay to watch and for the 67,000 fortunate enough to be here, Rooney was certainly worth the admission fee.

He did more than entertain them with his first professional hat-trick. He took them back to a glorious past and opened the door to a glittering future, leaving them spellbound in the process. 

Three months out with a broken foot did nothing to lessen his impact. Nor did the side Ferguson selected to play alongside him. David Bellion, Eric Djemba-Djemba and Kleberson occupied three of the four midfield places. Imagine what Rooney can achieve when he finally gets to line up with the real United.

Against Fenerbahce he was magnificent, providing a dazzling demonstration of pace, power, poise and precision. As a passer and a predator, he was simply sensational. All three goals came from outside the penalty area. Incredible.

Ruud van Nistelrooy provided the ammunition for his opening 17th-minute goal but after that Rooney delivered on his own. A 22-yard shot increased United's advantage. A 20-yard freekick then followed. 

Who needs David Beckham? Not United. Rooney even mimicked the England captain with a celebration that saw him run to the corner flag with his arms outstretched.

No wonder Ferguson said this a footballer who does not require coaching. He needs nurturing, yes. Protecting, certainly. But this is the boy, as Best said last week, who has 'everything'.

Sven Goran Eriksson had seen this before, and against Turkish opposition. He handed Rooney his full competitive debut in last year's European Championship qualifier and the teenager responded with the game of his life. The game of his life, that is, until he met France, Croatia and then Fenerbahce.

While Eriksson would have delighted in seeing Gary Neville return to action and Rio Ferdinand take the captain's armband, Rooney wasted little time in proving himself ready for next month's World Cup encounters against Wales and Azerbaijan-But then Rooney, it seems, is always ready.

United opened the scoring when Brazilian World Cupwinner Kleberson sent an accurate cross to Ryan Giggs and the Welshman headed past Rustu with considerable aplomb.

Already Rooney was sparkling - twisting, turning and running in a fashion defenders fear most.

Van Nistelrooy cut through Fenerbahce's back line with a beautifully timed pass, and then looked on in admiration as Rooney struck from just outside the area.

United manager Sir Alex Ferguson said afterwards: 'I don't suppose I have seen a debut like it.

'What you saw tonight is the reason why we signed him. And I think he can only get stronger now. We think the boy has great potential and it was a great performance and a great start by him.'

Fenerbahce coach Christoph Daum was equally as enthusiastic, saying: 'Maybe he will become the player of the century.'

His second goal arrived in the 28th minute, and it was another trademark strike from a prodigious talent. A sidestep to escape the attention of Umit Ozan, the Fenerbahce captain, was followed by a blistering 22-yard drive.

'Rooney, Rooney, Rooney,' cried the fans. Those who once hailed Denis Law as the King now have their Prince.

Fenerbahce reduced the deficit when Marcio Nobre met a 47th-minute corner with a volley, but Rooney's free - kick arrived seven minutes later and again Old Trafford rose to its feet.

There was a moment when he stumbled from the sublime to the ridiculous, a backpass that looked more like a shot resulting in a corner for Fenerbahce and another goal for the Turkish champions from Tuncay Sanli. 

But Van Nistelrooy scored in the 78th minute with an excellent finish, and Bellion left Rustu beaten for a sixth time after running on to a pass from - who else?

Rooney. Remarkable.

The goals made Rooney the youngest player to score a hat-trick in the Champions League at 18 years and 335 days.

He scored 17 goals in 43 appearances for United during his debut season but it was a campaign of disappointment for Sir Alex Ferguson's team.

They finished a massive 18 points behind champions Chelsea in the Premier League, ending up in third place, and were eliminated by AC Milan in the last 16 of the Champions League.

The rest of Rooney's career at Old Trafford is, of course, pretty impressive. He now has 218 goals in 443 matches for the club and has won six Premier League titles, three League Cups, the Champions League and the FIFA Club World Cup.
