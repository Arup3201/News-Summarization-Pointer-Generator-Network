 

Yorkshire celebrated their LV= County Championship title triumph by dressing up as TV characters and going on a pub crawl.

The champions did the Otley Run on Saturday, which takes in many of the drinking establishments in the Headingley area of Leeds, for their end-of-season do.

Seamer Jack Brooks took a photo of his Yorkshire team-mates in various guises and posted it on Twitter.

It was accompanied by the caption: 'Love these boys! Dominated the Otley Run and still celebrating being Champions! #Vikings #StrongUnit.'

Highlights included Jonny Bairstow dressed as Robin, Joe Root as Mario (from Super Mario Bros, not Balotelli) and opener Adam Lyth as Kermit. 

Lyth and his team-mates were anything but muppets on the field, sealing the title with a match to spare.

There was controversy though, as captain Andrew Gale was not allowed to lift the trophy because of a disciplinary procedure over comments he made during a match against Lancashire.
