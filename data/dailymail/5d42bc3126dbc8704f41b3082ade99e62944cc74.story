Brentford have confirmed that manager Mark Warburton will leave the club at the end of the season after an agreement was reached with owner Matthew Benham.

Reports that Warburton's time at promotion pushing Brentford were numbered have been around since last week and the club have confirmed that the 52-year-old, along with sporting director Frank McParland and assistant manager David Weir, will all leave Griffin Park in the summer. 

Warburton replaced Uwe Rosler last season when the German moved to Wigan and guided them to promotion from League One.

Since promotion, Brentford have been one of the surprise packages in the Championship this season and have been pushing for the play-offs. But regardless if the Bees go up to the Premier League or remain in the Championship, Warburton will leave the club.

Owner Benham has made the decision, which will be met with dismay by Brentford fans, following a disagreement over the long-term direction of the club.

Benham said: 'I am a passionate Brentford fan and every decision I take is intended to be in the best long-term interests of the club.

'Some of the decisions taken to date have been easy and some, like this one, have been extremely hard.

'Under Mark's stewardship, Brentford have achieved a high league position and played football which is a joy to watch.

'It is difficult to seek to implement change, particularly when things appear to be going so well, but I am single minded in my resolve that we can leave no stone unturned in our quest for sustainable Premier League Football.

'Innovation, not increased funding, can be the only route to success for clubs such as ours, and I fully accept that innovation is never without risk.

'We are continuing to build a strong base for the future.

'Everything has been perfectly amicable between all parties and we remain friends.'

Brentford lost 3-0 to Charlton at the weekend and slipped out of the play-off places 

Warburton was appointed Bees manager in December 2013, moving from his previous role as sporting director, following  Rosler's departure.

He led them to promotion five months later and their form in the Championship has been remarkable - they only slipped out of the top six for the first time this season following a 3-0 defeat at Charlton on Saturday.

That setback came after reports emerged that Benham was planning to make the shock managerial change at the end of the campaign despite the almost unprecedented success the unfashionable west London club have been enjoying.

It is understood Benham and Warburton clashed in January over the club's transfer policy, with the manager unwilling to bring in new faces which might have unsettled the current squad.

Benham will now look to appoint a head coach, rather than a manager, who the club crucially say will 'have a strong input into the players brought into the club, but not an absolute veto'.

Warburton confirmed there had been a disagreement over 'key philosophical differences' which could not be reconciled.

But he added: 'In my remaining time at the club we shall move heaven and earth to get the promotion that the players, fans and Matthew deserve and going forward, I wish the club every success in its ongoing adventure.

'David and I, and indeed all the staff, remain totally focused on supporting this squad of players and ensuring they are best prepared for each and every remaining fixture this season.'
