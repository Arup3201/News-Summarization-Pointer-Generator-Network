The BTK serial killer is helping to write a book about his heinous crimes because he believes people need to know how a criminal mind works.

Dennis Rader, 69, is currently serving 10 consecutive life sentences for 10 murders in Wichita, Kansas, between 1974 and 1991.

He earned the moniker BTK killer as details emerged that he consistently 'bound', 'tortured', then 'killed' his victims - none of which his wife knew about until he was charged.

Book deal: BTK killer Dennis Rader, 69, revealed he has been working on a book with a professor about his mind. He was dubbed BTK because he bound, tortured and killed his 10 murder victims from 1974 to 1991

Letter: In a handwritten message dated 29 September, Rader revealed the news himself

Now, the father-of-two and former church leader has vowed to claims he plans to help the families monetarily by assisting a University of Pennsylvania professor on a book studying his mind.

In a handwritten open letter from his cell in El Dorado Correctional Facility, Kansas, Rader revealed the news.

'The main reason for the book idea, is to help the VF's (Victims Fund) monetarily wise; something I had hoped for years, to help them and in a way to pay my debt to them,' Rader wrote, according to Kansas News. 

'I can never replace their love ones, my deeds too 'dark' to understand, the book or movies, etc. is the only way to help them.

'I mean to burn no bridges and hope some day to open up. 

'People like me, need to be under stood, so the criminal professional field, can better under stand, the criminal mind. That would be my way helping debt to society.'

He adds that he cannot say very much because he is barred from making or fueling profits from his crimes, but he knows the book is 'close to a deal'.

Inspired: The new movie A Good Marriage that hit theaters yesterday was inspired by Rader lying to his wife

Victims: These pictures show eight of his victims, ranging in age from 21 to 62, in Wichita, Kansas

Following his arrest, several of the victims' relatives sued Rader, and secured a settlement that agreed he can never profit from his crimes or coverage of them. 

The non-fiction book will not be sensationalist, author Katherine Ramsland insists, and Rader will not profit from it. 

'I'm trying to make this a serious effort that will have some benefit for people who study this kind of crime,' she said.

That work involved correspondence with Rader, she explained.

His words come after his daughter broke the family's nine-year silence to condemn a film by Stephen King allegedly inspired by Rader's secrets, as his wife never knew about the murders.

Kerri Rawson, has said King is 'exploiting' the people her father killed and her own family with his new film, A Good Marriage.

The movie, which hit theaters on October 3, is about a woman who is unaware her husband is a serial killer.

It is based on a short story the author wrote in 2010, which he then adapted for the screen.

While promoting the film, King has said on programs like The View that he was inspired by the BTK killer when he came up with the idea for the story, about a man whose own family was unaware of the horrible atrocities he had committed.

Rawson, 36, and her family were also unaware her father was a killer.

'He’s exploiting my father’s 10 victims and their families,' Rawson told the The Kansas City Star.

She then said of her father, 'He is not worth all the books and the news stories and all the attention.' 

Rader responded in his letter: 'I'm sorry my daughter is upset, I would be too.' 

He added that his wife Paula did not know about the crimes, adding: 'The family knew nothing about my ‘Dark Deeds.’ I carried that secret until the day I was arrested.'
