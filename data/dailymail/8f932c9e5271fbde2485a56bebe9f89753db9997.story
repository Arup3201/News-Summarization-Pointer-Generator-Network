The US Army has sent a list of social media guidelines to military families after the names, photos and addresses of soldiers fighting ISIS were leaked by the terrorist group 

A list posted online by a group called the 'Islamic State Hacking Division' earlier this month gave personal information for 100 US military members and called upon its lone wolf 'brothers residing in America' to kill them.

Much of the information published was believed to be publicly available online, and the Army has warned its personnel that 'social media will continue to be leveraged as a tool by those who wish to threaten and/or target members or the military.'

A group called the Islamic State Hacking Division posted information about 100 US military members online. The Army has responded by telling soldiers to take precautions such as getting security systems

In the posting, the ISIS hacking division asked its followers to kill military members 'wherever you find them.' Army personnel were told not to meet up with people they meet online and to use peepholes in doors

Several military members whose information was linked in the attack said that they were not afraid of the extremists who had targeted them

ISHD said it wants 'lone wolf' attackers to go after the military members and 'kill them wherever you find them'.

The Army message said that the leak targeted members 'in retaliation for airstrikes in Iraq and Syria,' according to the Washington Times.

It said that 'images posted over time may form a complete mosaic of you and your family' and warned soldiers against letting friends tag their locations on sites such as Facebook.

Soldiers were also told that they should not meet up with people they have met online and to always use peepholes before opening any doors.

The Army reportedly listed more than a dozen safety steps and said that members should limit the amount they talk about their service and use solid-core doors, heavy locks and home window security systems.

The US Marine Corps said it was visiting all affected staff, and urged caution online in the aftermath of the leak.  

'It is recommended Marines and family members check their online/social footprint, ensuring privacy settings are adjusted to limit the amount of available personal information,' US Marine Corps Lieutenant Colonel John Caldwell said in a statement.

US Central Command issued a statement on its Facebook page saying that 'We are operating in a 'new norm' in which cyber threats are real and constant.' 

The Navy released a set of general guidelines telling sailors not to detail ship movements or 'friend' strangers on social media. 

The group claimed it hacked several military servers, databases and emails to obtain the information on the list, though much of the information could be found publicly online 

'Any CENTCOM teammate or family member could be targeted. To that end, we all should maintain a heightened sense of vigilance whether dealing with work or home computer usage, specifically as it relates to Social Media.' 

One serviceman who was identified in the leak said that 'We have a footprint -- the best we can do is to make that foot print not so deep in the sand'. 

However, other several service members spoke out on and said that ISIS's intimidation tactic was 'not going to work'.

One of three service members who spoke anonymously to ABC News said that it was not surprising that the extremists wanted to kill members of the US military.

'I wouldn't say I'm scared,' one said. 'It's just part of this 'new war' against an enemy with a different, more developed capability than what we've faced in the past. 

'We have to make the adjustments in order to continue to win the battles.'

ISIS claimed it hacked several military servers, databases and emails to obtain the information.

However, a defense official said that the list did not appear to be from a breach, and that the names and addresses were publicly available online. 

'We really weren't surprised because all the people I saw on that list are on a webpage some place anyways, all that information was already public,' and identified soldier said.

Posting read: 'Kill them in their own lands, behead them in their own homes, stab them to death as they walk'

The ISHD posting read: 'With the huge amount of data we have from various different servers and databases, we have decided to leak 100 addresses so that our brothers in America can deal with you.

'And now we have made it easy for you by giving you addresses, all you need to do is take the final step, so what are you waiting for?

'Kill them in their own lands, behead them in their own homes, stab them to death as they walk their streets thinking that they are safe.' 

One anonymous serviceman said that the list's publication was 'regrettable'. 

The Defense Department and the Federal Bureau of Investigation are looking into the matter, the New York Times reported. 

An official told the paper most of the information on the list could be found in public records, residential address search sites and on social media.

ISIS (pictured) has claimed responsibility for previous online-based attacks on the US military, notably hacking Central Command's Twitter account in January 

Many of the personnel on the list were mentioned in news articles about air strikes on ISIS.

However some of them were part of units that had no connection to the Middle Eastern bombing campaign. 

The faces of the women who appeared on the list were blurred out.

ISIS has claimed responsibility for hacking attacks in the United States in the past, including against Central Command, which oversees the air war against the terrorist group.

In January, the hacked Centcom Twitter feed posted what appeared to be an office phone directory of officers that was slightly out of date, forcing the military temporarily to take down the command's Twitter feed.

The words 'CyberCaliphate' and 'I love you ISIS' replaced Central Command's usual logo on Twitter and YouTube before the pages were suspended.
