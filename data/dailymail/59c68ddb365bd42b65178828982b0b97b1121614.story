Inside the lock up garage in Heanor Derbyshire where trading standards uncovered a plant for bottling counterfeit vodka 

This is the fake alcohol distillery in a lock-up garage where police found counterfeit vodka was being bottled.

The discovery came as almost 2,500 litres of fake wine and spirits were seized during a pre-Christmas enforcement drive by trading standards.

In total more than 1,800 litres of illegal wine and 600 litres of fake spirits and other alcohol was discovered in the UK during the campaign.

A raid in Heanor in Derbyshire at a lock-up garage uncovered a plant for bottling counterfeit vodka by trading standards and HMRC officers.

When the vodka that was being bottled at the plant was tested, officers found it to contain iso-propanol (IPA), which can causes intense drunkenness and is often used in cleaning chemicals.

Professor Tony Hines, director of crisis management at Leatherhead Food Research, said: 'IPA poisoning causes confusion and can be very painful.

'Appreciating the difference between excessive alcohol consumption, "binge drinking" for example and IPA consumption, even at low levels, a couple of doubles will cause dizziness, low blood pressure, abdominal pain and nausea.'

The crackdown on fake alcohol comes as part of an international campaign, Operation OPSON, involving more than 50 countries, organised by Interpol and Europol.

The operation also saw the closure of an illegal factory making vodka from screen wash and saw a increase in the number of seizures of fake spirits.

Minister for Intellectual Property Baroness Neville-Rolfe said: 'The UK is committed to cracking down on crime that harms proper businesses and can pose a real threat to public safety.

'Even though we have one of the safest food industries in the world, there are still criminals who want to profit at the expense and safety of others.

'This year’s Operation OPSON results show the continued strength of the UK’s enforcement regime, led by Trading Standards and coordinated by the Intellectual Property Office, in protecting consumers and businesses.'

In the Czech Republic, fake vodka resulted in the deaths of 50 people from methanol poisoning after they drank the subanstance in 2012, with a further 80 being blinded as a result of the poisoning.

In 2014, two men were sentenced to life imprisonment in connection with the incident.
