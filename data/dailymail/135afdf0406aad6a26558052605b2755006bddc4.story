They have an unenviable reputation for being a nation of penny-pinching skinflints.

But a recent study has found the timeworn cliché of the tight-fisted Scotsman is wholly inaccurate and it is really the Welsh who are Britain's stingiest people.    

A survey of 2000 adults by mobile phone app Click A Taxi, found residents of Edinburgh and Glasgow are twice as likely to tip their cab driver than the average Briton.

Told ye: The old cliche that Scottish people are tight-fisted has been proved wrong (Pictured: Gregor Fisher as loveable Glaswegian Rab C Nesbitt)

Only one in ten Scots never tips, whereas that number rises to one in four in Wales and one in five England.

Scots were found to be the most generous, tipping 90 per cent of the time, with an average tip of £1.02 for a £9 journey, 16 per cent higher than the national average of 88p and 78p in Wales.

More than half of the population never give more than £1 no matter what the fare.

Nikolaj Køster, co-founder of Click A Taxi, said: 'Tipping is a topic that often sparks debate on who deserves a tip: should we tip only for a good service, shall we tip taxi drivers, hairdressers or when ordering a take out?

'We looked specifically at tipping taxi drivers and discovered some stark regional differences.

'We also learned that women are more generous than men, that the older we get the more we tip and, surprisingly, the more we work, the less we tip.'

Women were found to be better tippers with only 19 per cent admitting to never tipping compared to 23 per cent of men.

Age was found to be an even more inportant factor with half of Brits under the age of 24 not tipping compared to only eight per cent of those over the age of 65.

Surprisingly people in full-time employment tip less frequently than those in part-time work or unemployed.

Looking at the picture in UK cities, the researchers found that Brighton has the most generous tippers, with 94 per cent always tipping their drivers.

The least tipping city in the UK is Birmingham, with 34 per cent never leaving a tip. Here are the  across the country:
