A British winemaker has accused the French of trying to pass off their wine as British by wrapping it in a Union Jack.

Bob Lindo has written to Home Secretary Theresa May to vent his anger over the scam to trick foreigners into buying a ‘British’ souvenir when they come to watch the Olympics or Queen’s Jubilee celebrations.

Mr Lindo, who owns the Camel Valley vineyard at Wadebridge, Cornwall, forced the World Duty Free shop at Gatwick Airport to remove a sign heralding French champagne as the ‘Best of British’ following an incident on Tuesday night.

The Lanson champagne bottles were wrapped in Union flags which Mr Lindo says is ‘unacceptable’.

In his letter to May, who is one of his customers, Mr Lindo wrote: 'I had to insist on the Best of British sign being removed from the Lanson display stand in the duty free shop at Gatwick airport. They removed the sign after I refused to leave until they did.

'This is clearly an attempt to con visitors for the Olympics and the Jubilee into taking home a "British" souvenir. We have a lot of red tape to deal with within the UK wine industry, often involving the tiniest or irrelevant detail, but we get on with it.

'Meanwhile this outrageous attempt to pass off an inferior champagne (It came 89th in a recent blind tasting, behind 85 English sparkling wines and three other sparkling wines) as British, is left to happen by those same regulatory bodies that police us with such efficiency.

'I don’t believe that wrapping a French wine in the Union Flag is remotely acceptable.'

Mr Lindo wrote to Defra, the Food Standards Agency and his association members and also to Lanson International saying they have breached wine standards.

He said in his letter to Lanson: 'On behalf of English Wine producers I wish to formally and most strongly state our objections to a promotion being carried by Champagne Lanson of which they are very clearly passing off and purporting to "Best of British".'

Mr Lindo said: 'It made my blood boil when I saw that sign - it was a deliberate attempt to pass the champagne off as British when it is most certainly not.

'If anyone dares to call their wines champagne, the French go mad and start suing people.'

Lanson, who created the limited edition Union Flag bottle costing about £31 to celebrate the Jubilee, has now agreed to remove the Best of British signs, said Mr Lindo.
