While the rest of us are tucking into turkey on Christmas Day, spare a though for one mother, who has had to take to 35,000ft to spend the holidays with her family.

Siblings Sarah-Jane, Christopher and Michael Gates will all be working on a British Airways flight from Sydney to Singapore on December 25, instead of celebrating at home in Bedfordshire.

Sarah-Jane and her twin brothers will be serving Christmas dinner to 300 passengers on board the flight - one of whom will be their mother Kareen, who they have brought along for the ride.

Siblings (L-R) Christopher Gates (cabin crew), Sarah-Jane Gates (customer service director) and Michael Gates (cabin crew) will all be flying together for British Airways over Christmas

In their bid to keep the family together, the siblings used the complimentary tickets they have for friends and family to whisk their mother away with them for the journey to Australia and back.

The group left on the first leg of their trip on December 20 and will wake up to a barbecued breakfast in Sydney on Christmas Day. 

Then they will board a flight to Singapore where the children will work while Kareen enjoys a slap-up meal, before landing in Singapore for dinner.

The family will eventually land back in the UK on December 29, just in time to recover for New Year's Eve.

Customer service manager Sarah-Jane, who has worked for British Airways for four years, said: 'I am so excited for this Christmas, as it will be the first time in four years that we have all spent the festive season together. 

The family will spend the morning in Sydney celebrating Christmas Day with a barbecue

They Gates family will then jet to Singapore in time for Christmas Day evening

'What better way to spend it than having a barbeque on the beach in the morning and dinner in Singapore the same evening?! 

'Flying is a huge part of our lives so to spend Christmas somewhere exotic and together is fantastic. Not many people get to experience two completely different cultures in one day, and it’s great because our Christmas Day will last 27 hours instead of 24!'

Inspired by his older sister’s jet-setting lifestyle, 22-year-old Christopher applied shortly after his 19th birthday, with Michael joining the airline earlier this year.

Kareen, who has travelled around the globe, as she tries to join one of her children on a trip once a month, said: 'I'm so excited for Christmas this year. Being fortunate enough to travel around the world with my children is an opportunity not many people experience. 

'To spend Christmas with my children is fabulous but to spend it in two cities in one day is a bonus. I am very proud of all my children working for British Airways. I’m also relieved that I won’t have to cook Christmas dinner for once!'

Christopher and Michael followed their older sister Sarah-Jane into work at British Airways as they whole family loves to travel

Christopher added: 'This will make Christmas 2014 one to remember!'

The three Gates siblings are among the 3,500 British Airways cabin crew looking after customers on Christmas Day.

The airline is gearing up for its biggest ever operation, carrying some 2.7 million customers over the festive period.

On December 25, 267 flights flown by 817 pilots will be making their way around the airline’s network delivering loved ones.

Cabin crew will serve 37,000 turkey dinners and traditional mince pies, as well as popping thousands of champagne corks.
