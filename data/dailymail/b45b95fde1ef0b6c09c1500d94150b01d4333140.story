Andy Murray is thoroughly enjoying himself at the French Open, not just on the court but also with all the speculation surrounding who he might employ as coach in succession to Ivan Lendl.

The Wimbledon champion eased through to the third round with a comprehensive 6-3, 6-1, 6-3 victory over Australia’s Marinko Matosevic in a manner that suggests he can go well into the second week.

After the one hour and 56 minute victory he addressed what is the biggest sub-plot of his career right now and admitted that he has spoken to at least one woman about coaching him in the future.

The day after Amelie Mauremo claimed, a tad disingenuously, that she spent three hours watching him play a Kazakh in the first round purely as research for French TV, Murray asserted he would not be afraid to go against convention and be coached by a woman.

He changes his tune regularly about the whole matter but said on Thursday: 'I’ve spoken to a few people, male and female.  For me I don’t care. I don’t really care whether some of the other male players like it or not.

'I was coached by my Mum for a long time. There have been ex players around who have said ‘oh your Mum shouldn’t be around or she shouldn’t come and support you or come to watch. It’s silly. Everyone is entitled to have the team around them that they want. Everyone works differently.

'Some men might not work with a female, some men might work well with a female coach. It is just whatever your preference is and whatever your needs are.“A lot of people have been talked about, and they are all very good, I like all of the people that have been mentioned. When the time is right I will make an announcement.'

Far from ‘having to put up with it’ as he insisted, Murray is clearly liking the speculation. He could shut it down by declining to discuss it – like he does the topic of Scottish independence for example – but obviously does not find it too much of a distraction.

His mother Judy wants to see more women coaching in the professional game, and back in London on Thursday talked of what it is like to be in a ‘male-dominated world’.

'I think I came in for a load of rubbish talked about me because I was the mother of sons,' she said at an event for the Women’s Sports Trust with Microsoft. 'If I was the mother of daughters I don’t think anyone would really have noticed me, or if I’d been the father of sons. Women in decision-making positions will make more things happen.'

Her son’s next opponent will be the German Philipp Kohlschreiber, the world number 24 from Germany who will be quite different to the entertaining Australian affectionately known as "Mad Dog".

Murray faced the dog on the Oval-shaped Court One, known as the Bullring. It is due to be pulled down as part of the redevelopment of Roland Garros, which is a shame, as something the French Open has over Wimbledon is the character of its outside courts in relation to those of the All England Club, which are functional and soulless by comparison.

The 27 year-old Scot said he will miss court one when it is gone, with the crowd tight in on the players and able to hear their every exhalation and, in this case, expletive, of which there were quite a few from the Aussie.

As Murray pointed out: 'Everyone picks up on the players who speak English but some of the stuff in other languages is a lot worse.'

Kohlschreiber is likely to employ better tactics than Matosevic, who could hit explosively but did not always use his brain. Time and again, for example, he kept directing his second serve to the lethal Murray backhand and time and again it got drilled back past him.

It was an assured display from Murray with quick starts to each set and some strong serves when they were needed, but the test of how he will really cope at a Grand Slam without a senior coach in his box is about to come.
