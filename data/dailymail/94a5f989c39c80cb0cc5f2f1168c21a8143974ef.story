Following cinema chains across the US pulling Sony Pictures' The Interview, the California-based firm is now considering ways in which the controversial film can be shown online.

Sites such as YouTube, Netflix and Crackle are among the options currently being discussed to make sure the film gets distributed.

During an interview with CNN, Sony Entertainment boss Michael Lynton said the movie will be released, but it just needs to work out the best way of doing so.

Earlier this month, Sony cancelled The Interview's premiere and delayed its 25 December release date, after  hackers threatened real-world attacks on cinemas screening it. 

Four of the five major North American theatres chains - Cinemark, Cineplex, Regal Cinemas, and AMC Entertainment - also announced plans to pull the film. 

President Barack Obama said  Sony had 'made a mistake' in their decision to pull the film, to which Mr Lynton responded: 'Sony has been fighting to get this picture distributed. It will be distributed.'

During an interview with CNN, Sony Entertainment boss Michael Lynton (pictured) said the movie will be released, but it just needs to work out the best way of doing so. A statement from the firm added it was 'actively surveying alternatives to release the movie on a different platform'

For example, the company owns video site Crackle (pictured), and could use that as a way to release the film online. Elsewhere, Mr Lynton said YouTube (right) was another option. But the firm may equally choose a subscription service, such as Netflix, to recoup some of the costs of the movie

Mr Lynton added: 'How it's going to be distributed, I don't think anybody knows quite yet. But it's going to be distributed,' citing a digital release as a viable option.

The Interview comedy stars James Franco and Seth Rogen as journalists who assassinate North Korea’s leader, Kim Jong-un.

Following the announcement of the film, the North Korean government is said to have issued statements warning against the film’s release to executives at Sony Pictures Entertainment. 

On 24 November 24, the Sony Pictures Entertainment computer network was breached, and employees were shown an image that revealed they had been hacked by a group called Guardians of Peace, or GOP. 

GOP said it had obtained, as well as wiped, data from Sony's servers including email exchanges between chairman Amy Pascal and producer Scott Rudin.  

Other leaked documents revealed personal information about Sony employees, as well as pay details of actors, and copies of upcoming films including Brad Pitt’s Fury, Mike Leigh’s Mr. Turner plus a script for the newest James Bond film.

The hackers then made demands and warned that the 'world will be full of fear. Remember the 11th September 2001.' 

Sony  cancelled the premiere of The Interview and four of the five major North American theatres chains - Cinemark, Cineplex, Regal Cinemas, and AMC Entertainment - announced plans to pull the film.

Social media accounts, designed to promote the film, were taken offline and Sony said it would be delay the film's theatrical release. 

A statement from the FBI then explicitly linked the attack to the Korean regime, saying  technical details from the hack have Korean hallmarks.

But Kim Jong-un's officials responded by calling FBI claims a 'fabrication', and describing U.S. actions as 'gangster-like'.

North Korea called the hack a 'righteous deed' - and reiterated that it 'highly esteems' the attack - but said it had no idea where it came from.

President Barack Obama said  Sony had 'made a mistake' in their decision to pull the film, to which Sony Entertainment boss Michael Lynton responded: 'Sony has been fighting to get this picture distributed. It will be distributed.'

Mr Lynton added, however: 'How it's going to be distributed, I don't think anybody knows quite yet,' he said. 'But it's going to be distributed.'

But, Mr Lynton added that no 'major video on-demand distributor' had so far come forward or said it was willing to distribute the film. 

A statement from the firm added it was 'actively surveying alternatives to release the movie on a different platform.'

'It is still our hope that anyone who wants to see this movie will get the opportunity to do so,' the statement continued.

Google, which owns YouTube, is not commenting on the claims. 

Netflix, and Sony have not responded to MailOnline's request for comment. 

Online content site Ownzones told MailOnline that it is willing to release the film.

The company has previously streamed feature-length content and said it is familiar with the premium content model.

Ownzone's said it also wishes to work with Sony to ensure that a percentage of the proceeds from distribution are donated to a charity supporting the freedom of speech.

Earlier this month, Sony cancelled The Interview's premiere and delayed its 25 December release date, after hackers threatened real-world attacks on cinemas screening it. The vast majority of cinema chains which were set to screen the movie also pulled it after these threats

On Friday, FBI officials  explicitly linked the hack to the Korean regime, saying  technical details from the hack have Korean hallmarks.

But Kim Jong Un's officials responded by calling FBI claims a 'fabrication', and describing US actions as 'gangster-like'.

The government also claimed to have 'clear evidence' the US government engineered the project as a 'propaganda' attack against North Korea.

North Korea then threatened more attacks against the US government and other American institutions. 

Referring to America as a 'cesspool of terrorism', the country said  it had already lashed out at the 'citadels of the US imperialists', naming the White House and Pentagon in particular.

According to the post, the North Korean government is also convinced  directors Seth Rogen and Evan Goldberg were under direct instruction from US officials, who told them to include extra scenes to 'insult the dignity' of North Korea. 

President Barack Obama said Sony had 'made a mistake' in their decision to pull the film. President Obama also announced there was consideration to put the rogue state back on the list of state sponsors of terrorism
