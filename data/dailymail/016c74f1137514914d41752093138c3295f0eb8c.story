SECOND SEASON SYNDROME AT MAN CITY

The way Man City are at the minute, you have to wonder if they’ll go the same way as the last time they won the title.

When Roberto Mancini won in 2012, they couldn’t replicate it the next season, struggling in the Champions League and finishing 11 points behind Man United.

If that was a bad defence to their title then, if City aren’t careful, this one could be even worse.

They are already in danger of going out of the Champions League and have four fewer points than they did at the same stage in 2012-13. You wonder if, having won the title the previous year, they don’t show enough respect to some opposition.

That certainly looked the case against West Ham on Saturday. That combined with some sloppy defending and individual errors must be worrying for them.

Despite that they look like the only team capable of matching Jose Mourinho’s Chelsea and after United’s late equaliser on Sunday, they got away with slipping further behind.

But City have to start performing and soon because a squad as brilliant as their’s should be doing much, much better.

SET-PIECE SHAME AT OLD TRAFFORD

With two set piece goals at Old Trafford on Sunday, it shows you just how fine the margins can be in the big games.

When Didier Drogba slammed in that header, I couldn’t believe what I was seeing. Not because he had scored, but the way United defended the corner.

I don’t care if Drogba’s 36 or 46, he’s still one of the best headers we’ve seen in this league. Why on earth was Rafael marking him? Drogba is 6ft 2in. Rafael is 5ft 8in. 

Before the game every team has a list of who is marking who. There must have been raised eyebrows when those two were put together.

Robin van Persie covered the front post but he should have been the man on Drogba. Then, without the height of Branislav Ivanovic, Chelsea concede from a set piece at the death to draw.

Those are the kind of details that win and lose games.

PS That’s twice now - against City and United - Chelsea have been 1-0 up, brought on Jon Obi Mikel and conceded late on. It’s not him as a player, it’s the message of the manager. Jose is a safety first boss but when you make that switch, it tells the team to sit back and defend. Unfortunately for him, it’s not working.

76% - Southampton have been rock-solid at the back this season, conceding just five goals so far - fewer than any other team in the top four tiers of English football. It’s not just the back four keeping teams at bay, though. Keeper Fraser Forster has the best saves-to-shot rate in the Premier League - higher than England colleagues Joe Hart (69%) and Ben Foster (66%).

20 - Wilfried Bony's goals against Leicester on Saturday took him level with Michu on 20 strikes for the club, making him their joint-top scorer in Premier League history.

28 - Since the beginning of the 2010-11 Premier League campaign, Leighton Baines has recorded 28 assists - 14 more than any other defender in that time.

1500 - Alexis Sanchez's second goal at Sunderland was Arsenal’s 1500th in the Premier League - they are the second team to reach the milestone after Manchester United.

4 - With seven strikes this season, top English scorer Saido Berahino has four more Premier League goals than any of his compatriots. This is a greater difference than between the top two native scorers in France (A Gignac 10, A Lacazette 8), Germany (M Gotze 6, A Meier 6), Italy (A Cassano 5, M Sau 4) and Spain (Nolito 5, A Bueno 4).

0 - Leonardo Ulloa began his Leicester career with a bang - netting five in his first five games - but he has failed to attempt a single shot in the four matches since.

2 - West Brom seem to enjoy playing against London sides - they have lost only two of their last 11 Premier League games against teams from the capital.

ALEXANDRE THE GREAT

After his masterclass against Manchester City, Premier League bosses will be kicking themselves for not taking a chance on Alex Song. 

The strikers have stolen the show at West Ham this season, but Song has been a class act in the middle. 

His time at Arsenal and Barca has given him a wealth of knowledge - he is so good at drawing fouls and keeping possession to take the sting out of games. He has helped free up Mark Noble and Stewart Downing, and though he won’t get an assist in the stats, his pass to spark West Ham’s first goal was topclass, as our graphic shows.

So credit to Sam Allardyce for giving him a go. It is working out perfectly.

Alex Song has been a class act since joining high-flyers West Ham from Barcelona in the summer

TADIC IS LAYING THEM ON THICK 

I was speaking to Ronald Koeman in the Sky studio this week about Dusan Tadic.

We see Tadic producing the goods every weekend but Koeman gets to work with him every day and he was effusing about just what a fantastic player he is.

Southampton has been perfect for Tadic because if he went to an Arsenal or a Man City, he might not have got in the team.

At St Mary’s he has become one of the main men. He is such a clever player and he set up another at the weekend.

He’s riding high in the assists charts alongside experienced Premier League stars like Cesc Fabregas and Glyfi Sigurdsson which shows just how well he has done to adapt so quickly.

REDS TO BUILD ON THE BACK

The only good thing you could talk about at Anfield on Saturday was Liverpool keeping a clean sheet. It was their second at home in seventh months. For a team with title aspirations, that’s just not good enough. 

There has been a lot of recent focus on the strikers and Mario Balotelli in particular for not scoring, but they really have to go back to basics in terms of not conceding goals. That is the foundation of any good side and once that stability is in place, maybe then Balotelli might get firing. If they are solid by the time Daniel Sturridge gets back, he will definitely start adding goals to the mix.

Mario Balotelli has come in for criticism having not scored but Liverpool must go back to basics this season

BATTLING BONY KEY FOR SWANS 

After covering their game against Leicester on Saturday night, I was very impressed with Swansea. 

They have made their best-ever start to a Premier League campaign and Gary Monk is excelling in his first full season in charge.

They have some good players at that club but Wilfried Bony is a real powerhouse up front. Monk has kept the passing philosophy and Bony fits in with that, but provides strength too.

He bullies defenders and he loves a shot, so it’s no surprise to see him score in his last three Premier League outings. 

Wilfried Bony has impressed for Swansea  this term and has scored in his last three Premier League matches
