Spoken out: Bristol Palin, 24, (pictured last year) has said on a blog post that accusations she punched someone in the face during the drunken family brawl are lies

Bristol Palin has finally spoken out about the drunken brawl that broke out between members of her family and friends at a birthday party.

The 24-year-old explained her side of the fight the day after an expletive-ridden audio tape of her police interview following the scrap in Anchorage, Alaska, was released. 

Many of the clips, some released by police, involve people accusing Sarah Palin's second eldest daughter of striking someone during the incident on September 6.  

The former Dancing In The Stars contestant condemned the 'lies' that she had punched someone in the face, saying that her 'perfect manicure to all ten of her nails' was intact afterwards. 

Sarah Palin's second eldest daughter then began to describe how the debacle unfolded, saying it began when a family friend was hit by a 'cheap shot'.

Writing on her blog on Wednesday night, she said: 'Why would anyone do this? Well, here's a hint. The guy was on social media during this incident, tweeting, 'about to get famous.' 

'Most of the time, I let the lies pass. After all, the truth eventually comes out. But when people are selling 'scoop,' photos, and false information… sometimes the truth just isn't as profitable.

After the first punch was thrown, according to Bristol, Willow, 20, said to the man's mom: 'Get a hold of your son.'

But the other women allegedly pushed.

'A grown woman pushed my little sister', she said. 

'After this incident, I still had a perfect manicure on all ten of my nails. 

'Plus – I'm left handed. I wouldn't even begin to know how to begin 'swinging' at someone,' she wrote. 

The post continued: 'Next to God, family is the most important thing to me. In fact, that day, we'd had a surprise party for my dad. We all secretly gathered in garage and yelled "surprise!" when he walked in. The real surprise was that we'd gotten him a truck too.

'But the evening that began so well took a turn for the worse when this guy decided he wanted to 'get famous'.

Before finishing her post Bristol criticized the 'liberal media'  pointing out that Vice President Joe Biden's son was kicked out of the Navy after testing positive for cocaine and that Chelsea Clinton's father-in-law, Ed Mezvinsky, is a convicted felon.

She said they are being relatively ignored: 'Because the friends and family of the revered liberal elite are treated like delicate China Don't handle too roughly. They are precious. They are off limits. Don't push on them too hard.

Aftermath: Sarah Palin's second eldest daughter was pictured after the incident in Anchorage, Alaska, with dirt all over her jacket, claiming she was dragged along the ground 

Her own evidence: She also says her 'perfect manicure' on each of her ten nails in the aftermath is proof that she did not hit someone, even though reports from others have suggested she did 

Revelation: The post, the first time she has spoken about the incident, said: 'Most of the time, I let the lies pass. After all, the truth eventually comes out'

'In the meantime, I was pushed and held down by some guy… and the media salivates like a dog that’s just been given a bone.' 

On the audio that has been released by police, Bristol can be heard saying that the host of the party, Korey Klingenmeyer, 'came out of nowhere and pushes me on the ground… takes me by my feet, in my dress… my thong dress in front of everybody. Come on you c**t, get the f**k outta here! Come on you s**t get the f**k outta here.

Bristol said the incident occurred after she went to confront a woman who called her sister Willow a 'sl*t.' 

She can also be heard crying and getting short with the police, saying at one point, 'I have a 5-year-old in the car, so if you're going to question me, question me.'

She then gets upset saying that someone took her '$300 sunglasses and her fuc*ing shoes,' and asks that photos of her not show her face, saying 'there's nothing on my face except for beer and makeup.' 

Reaction: The post written by Sarah Palin's second eldest daughter on Wednesday continued: 'Next to God, family is the most important thing to me. In fact, that day, we'd had a surprise party for my dad

Witnesses to the booze-soaked brawl involving nearly every member of Sarah's family told police that Bristol, 23, was 'out of control' and accused her of striking Klingenmeyer repeatedly before he pushed her to the ground in defense, sparking the 20-person fight.

Willow says on the audio that her sister never punched the host in the face, eloquently telling an officer on the scene, 'She missed every f*cking time!' 

New photos show the aftermath of a brawl involving almost every member of the Palin family that happened in Anchorage, Alaska, in September.

It includes photos of Bristol covered in dirt and pictures of her red nail-varnished hands in the aftermath.

Police have also released audio of the Palin family giving a statement which features a very angry and frustrated Bristol, Willow and Sarah Palin.

The police report which dates from the night of father Todd Palin's 50th birthday celebration on September 6, lists Bristol as a suspect, her brother Track, 26, as a victim and Sarah and her husband as witnesses. 

Family fun: Todd Palin, 50, with son Trig, six, Sarah, 50, Bristol, 23, with her son Tripp, six, Willow, 20 and Track, 26, with his daughter Kyla Grace, three

Birthday celebrations: Bristol's post continues by saying that the main reason the family were together was to surprise their father by giving him a truck 

It also lists Willow, 20, as a 'person interviewed.'

The Palins had been celebrating Todd's birthday in their home town of Wasilla and had decided to go to their friend Klingenmeyer's house afterwards as he was also having a party.

Klingenmeyer, who has decided not to press charges in connection with the alcohol-inspired melee, claims that a fight started out front of his house and that Bristol came out the back where he was and began punching him repeatedly after crossed words.

When he stopped her punching him again, pushing her to the floor - her brother and father ran over and began fighting, sparking a brawl involving at least four men.
