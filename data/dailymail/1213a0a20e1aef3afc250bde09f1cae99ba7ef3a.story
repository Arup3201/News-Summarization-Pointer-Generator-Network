Superfan: Michael Foyle pictured queuing outside the Theatre Royal in Norwich for tickets to see singer Daniel O'Donnell

A Daniel O'Donnell superfan camped outside a theatre for two days to get tickets for his family to see their idol.

Grandfather-of-five Michael Doyle queued at the Theatre Royal in Norwich, Norfolk, to make sure he was first in line to get tickets to see the popular Irish singer when his tour arrives there later this year.

The 67-year-old traveled down to the city from Lincoln on Wednesday night armed with a flask, comfortable seat, sleeping bag and his Kindle and picked his space on the pavement outside at 1am on Thursday morning ahead of tickets going on sale today.

Theatre staff looked after Mr Foyle, providing him with extra food and drink.

Mr Foyle said: 'I'm queuing for four tickets - one for myself, one for my wife Sandra, who is the main Daniel O'Donnell fan in the family, my daughter Deborah Brown, 32, and my granddaughter Bethany Jackson, 14.

'My wife has followed Daniel for about 20 years.

'I don't mind doing it. I do it for my family.

'I have had a lot of people coming up to me to ask me what I'm doing, but they have all been nice.

'They thought I was protesting against something. I expected that more people would have joined the queue.'

The family has already seen Daniel perform in Nottingham, London, Edinburgh, Bristol, Halifax and Bradford.

And Mr Foyle's 57-and-a-half hour queuing stint is not the first time he has camped out for tickets - he queued overnight in Bournemouth last year.

John Bultitude, Norwich Theatre Royal spokesman, said: 'The days of people camping out in large numbers and queuing for tickets are becoming more of a thing of the past with the popularity of internet and telephone booking.

Popular: Singer Daniel O'Donnell has sold more than 10million records in a career spanning more than 25 years

'There are still a handful of customers who enjoy the camaraderie and atmosphere of queuing up outside the theatre to be the first to get tickets in their hands.

'They see it as part of the experience when it comes to a popular performer like Daniel O'Donnell.'

Affectionately known as 'Wee Daniel', O'Donnell has enjoyed success in Ireland and the UK as well as Australia and the US for a quarter of a century selling more than 10 million albums.

He is known for his close relationship with his fanbase and last year became the first artist to have a different album in the UK charts every year for 25 years.
