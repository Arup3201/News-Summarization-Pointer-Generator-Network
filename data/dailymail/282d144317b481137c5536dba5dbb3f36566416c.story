The identity of the traveler who was filmed as he made homophobic comments at Dallas/Fort Worth Airport last Thursday before attacking a man has finally been revealed.

Airport police reports released on Tuesday show that he is a 27-year-old from Shelbyville, Tennessee, whose name is McCleish Christmas Benham.

Video of Benham's attack, which ends with him being tackled to the ground by a group of heroic fellow travelers attempting to help the victim, has been viewed 4 million times on YouTube.

Meet McCleish: The homophobe who became infamous after a video of him attacking a passenger went viral has been revealed as McCleish Christmas Bunham (above) of Shelbyville, Tenneesse

Assault: Bunham can be seen above as he kicks a man in a pink shirt he believed to be 'queer'

According to the complainant in the report, who is the man in the pink shirt Benham can be seen attacking in the video, the whole melee began when Benham got into an argument with an American Airlines gate agent.

After insulting the agent, the complainant informed a visibly intoxicated Benham that police were on the way in an attempt to diffuse the situation, and when the agent then asked if Benham had been drinking, the man replied, 'Yes, 100 drinks.'

At this point, according to the Fort Worth Star-Telegram, Benham punched the complainant in the eye, for no apparent reason, called him a gay slur, and then began berating another traveler.

It seems that it was only then that Andrew Kennedy, the man who posted the YouTube video, began filming the incident on his cellphone, actually missing the beginning of the physical altercation.

How it all began: The complainant (above in pink shirt) angered Benham (in a green sweatshirt) when he tried to defend a gate agent the man had been berating 

Then, as the airport officer arrived on the scene, Benham again starting attacking the complainant, kicking him in the groin and pulling his hair before five nearby passengers tackled him to the ground.

When asked why he was attacking the complainant, Benham told one of the men subduing him, 'This is America, that’s why. It’s the same reason you get to live, to breathe, to walk black. You know what I’m talking about?'

Benham is being charged with simple assault and public intoxication.

The complainant, who wishes to remain unnamed, declined medical attention and had no visible marks or bruises.

One positive: One of the men who took down Benham, Ben Kravit (above), was confused for actor Paul Rudd when the video went viral

Double take: Kravit (circled in red) does bear a striking resemblance to Rudd

At least one person is getting something good out of this incident however, as Ben Kravit, a 28-year-old Dallas man who helped take Benham down, caused quite the stir on Monday when many watching the video believed him to be famed actor Paul Rudd.

Kravit said of that experience in an email to Jezebel on Tuesday, 'It was certainly fun to be a part of for a day, and something my friends and I will look back on and laugh about for many years.'
