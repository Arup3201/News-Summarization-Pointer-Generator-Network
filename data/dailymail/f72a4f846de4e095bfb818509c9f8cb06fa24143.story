A Bronx man who became an unwitting viral sensation for being strip-searched under citizens arrest 'after stealing a Snickers bar' is now suing the 7-Eleven store where it all started, claiming 'emotional distress'.

The 'candy thief', David Golson, 30, is said to have undergone trauma from the incident and the way in which it has since spread around the world.

The video, dated October 17, 2012, was taken by a fellow shopper in the Brooklyn 7-Eleven about 11.20pm.

Three of the clerks of the store - which is on Flatbush Avenue Extension - detain Golson and start ripping his clothes off during the ensuing struggle.

The Snickers struggle: David Golson is wrestled to the ground by three 711 clerks, who are attempting to strip search him on the suspicion of shoplifting

Having gone all around the world, the incident will again be aired, this time in Bronx Supreme Court, with David Golson (pictured) suing for emotional distress for the way he was treated

He was suspected of shoplifting and attempted to make a run for it.

The employees then drag him back inside the store.

While shoppers initially laugh at the scuffle, the scene quickly changes, and the employees are accused of 'attacking' Golson.

By the end of the three-minute clip, Golson is practically nude and humiliated.

'This is ridiculous! For some Snickers!' one shopper yells in the video.

Golson was detained until police arrived.

He was subsequently charged with robbery, assault, criminal mischief and criminal possession of stolen property.

Some parts of the Youtube video, like this one, get quite rough, as David Golson tries to break free from three 711 employees, screaming: 'I didn't take nothing.'

A 7-Eleven spokeswoman said at the time that one of the employees was fired for restraining the suspect.

It is said to be the one holding onto Golson for the majority of the video.

It was claimed the employee had bitten Golson's back during the struggle.

The other two workers were forced to retake a class regarding safety and security at the convenience store.

Practically naked: David Golson is now suing for 'emotional distress'. He was charged with a litany of felonies following the incident, even though it centered around one Snickers bar

Now, in documents filed in Bronx Supreme Court, the 30-year-old is suing for 'emotional distress' for both the way he was treated and the viral aftermath, according to NY Daily News.

It remains unclear whether police continued to press the charges against Golson.

The case continues.
