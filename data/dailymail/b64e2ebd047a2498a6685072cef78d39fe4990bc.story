Living in ramshackle tents and racing daily to be first in line for free hot food, this is hardly a holiday camp.

But for many of the hundreds of migrants living in makeshift campsites in northern France, the prospect of a better life in the UK rather than that of returning home to Iraq or Afghanistan makes it worth enduring the less-than-luxury conditions.

While an army of volunteers from a charity set up to help them provides warm food and clothing at the moment, the 1,000 or so migrants who have set up camp in Calais and the surrounding towns are desperate to make it to Britain.

Calais mayor Natacha Bouchart has described the number of migrants trying to make it across the Channel as 'untenable', blaming the UK benefits system for creating 'a plague' of camps which are 'tarnishing the town's image'.

She has previously blamed Britain's 'enormous' state hand-outs for luring migrants to her town and using it as a staging area hoping to be granted leave to get across the 26 mile or so stretch of water that separates us and France.

These pictures show what life is like in the makeshift camps that house as steady stream of migrants wanting to head to the UK.

They show volunteers from French charity SALAM, which has a lock up full of clothing, fruit and vegetables in the area ready to supply to the camps.

Around 300 people tirelessly peel fruit and vegetables and ferry a hot meal once a day to Calais and three times a week at three other nearby towns.

The charity was set up in 2002 following the closure of the Red Cross centre in Sangatte and started with just a handful of volunteers.

According to the charity, the migrants are mostly young men are mostly from countries including Afghanistan, Iran, Pakistan, Kurdistan, Iraq, Palestine and Somalia.

To get a handle on the steady stream of migrants living temporarily in northern France and attempting to claim asylum in the UK, Sangatte acted as a stepping stone for 50,000 immigrants to enter the UK and could house 1,000 at any one time - though it was often over capacity.

Former president Nicolas Sarkozy ordered the destruction of a squalid woodland camp known as the Jungle in 2009 and bussed almost 300 refugees out of the area.

A year later, another 100 migrants were removed from a woodland encampment in the Channel coast town of Teteghem.

Earlier this month, several hundred migrants from Syria occupied the ferry terminal at Calais.

They demanded to be granted passage to the UK after claiming they were treated 'like dogs' by the French authorities.

Just last week, the mayor of Calais hit out at the number of migrants setting up illegal squats in her town.

Mrs Bouchart, 50, has previously blamed Britain’s asylum and benefits system for ‘imposing’ hundreds of illegal migrants on her city.

Cooking: One volunteer heats up meals in giant pots ready to be served to those at the makeshift camp

Not going hungry: A hot meal is served in Calais every evening, at about 6.15 pm while food is also served every Tuesday, Thursday and Saturday in nearby Loon-Plage, Grande Synthe and Teteghem

Store room: The charity has a nearby warehouse packed with fruit and tinned goods, close to the camp

Transportation: Hot meals are put in special containers to ensure they are still hot and loaded into a truck to transport to the campsite

Mrs Bouchart, who 
was elected mayor in 2008, said: ‘It is scandalous that we live in a 
state where foreigners come here to disturb our town and our residents.'

She
was instrumental in the destruction of The Jungle, populated by hundreds of 
Afghans and Iraqis heading for the UK.

Afterwards,
migrants scattered, squatting in makeshift camps and occupying WW2 
German bunkers along the Channel coast.

In recent months they began 
targeting the centre of Calais.
