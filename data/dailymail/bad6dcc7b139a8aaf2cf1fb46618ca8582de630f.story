A heart-warming moment was brought to tragedy-hit Newtown, Connecticut, last night when their High School basketball team scored a breathtaking 3-point shot on the buzzer to win their final home game of the season.

The Nighthawks, Newtown High School's basketball team, were trailing by a point in their Senior Night game when guard Mike Daubert landed the miracle shot just as the final buzzer was heard.

A video of the shot swept the internet last night and led to the 17-year-old's moment of triumph being voted number 1 moment of ESPN’s SportsCenter Top 10 plays - beating Kobe Bryant's dunk against the Brooklyn Nets into number 2.

On the buzzer: Mike Daubert scored an amazing three pointer for the Newtown Nighthawks against New Milford last night

Basketball hero: Mike Daubert, right, was photographed with his basketball hero Knicks player Carmelo Anthony last week. The New York team traveled to Newtown last Tuesday for a 'day of fun'.

It comes a week after several members of the senior team, including Daubert, were able to meet the New York Knicks who visited the town to show their solidarity following the massacre at Sandy Hook Elementary. 

Daubert now proudly displays a picture of himself alongside Carmelo Anthony as his Twitter profile picture.

Following the visit the star forward told ESPN: 'We went out there (and) it was just good to see a lot of people 
smile all over again. Just to be doing the things that we were doing -- 
playing the games, playing basketball with them, just making people 
smile and feel happy about themselves.'

Coach Tim Tallcouch told the Oklahoman how important the team's visit to the town had been for young people in the area. 

'Between myself, the town of Newtown and the NY Knicks organization, the Knicks Garden of Dreams Foundation, player, coaches, executives and dancers came to Newtown CT yesterday and put many smiles on the faces of the Sandy Hook Elementary kids with two hours of a fun clinic/event. Simply AMAZING!!! It really does make a difference.'

Reflection: Like other schools in the area Newtown High School has had to overcome the grief following the shooting of 26 at the nearby Sandy Hook elementary school in December

The miracle moment also came two days after Newtown students movingly joined Jennifer Hudson to sing America the Beautiful at the Super Bowl.

At their opening home game of the season the Nighthawks wore warm-up sweaters with Sandy Hook Elementary printed on the front with the words Never Forgotten on the back above a number 26. 

Coach Tallcouch who also teaches chemistry told the The Hour Sports Podcast: 'Things will never be the same as far as Newtown is concerned. We as teachers are going to face one of the biggest challenges trying to get these kids to feel comfortable again learning in the classroom. From a basketball perspective, the fact the kids are back in the gym - that has been a real positive'
