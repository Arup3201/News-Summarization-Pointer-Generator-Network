A dog who encountered intruders and ended up taking two bullets for her family is finally back home in Los Angeles after undergoing surgery thanks to a shelter's crowdfunding campaign.

Charlie was shot as the burglars who broke into her Southern California ran down the street. Her owner says if Charlie didn't take the bullet, it would likely have hit one of her kids.

Charlie ended up having to have a leg amputated after stepping in to save her family last weekend.

Home at last: Charlie, a heroic dog who was shot while protecting her owners, is back home with her family in Los Angeles and recovering from surgery

Our hero: If Charlie had not been in the line of fire, bullets may have struck one of the family's children, the dog's owner says

She was at home in Los Angeles with her two sibling pups when burglars broke into the house.

All three three dogs chased the intruders into the street but in an act of cowardice, one of the would-be robbers shot at the defenseless pets.

Two bullets hit Charlie injuring her front and back right legs.

Knowing something was terribly wrong, one of Charlie's sibling dogs tried to push her back to the house after she was shot.

Seem happy enough! Charlie, the now-three-legged dog, had to have a leg amputated after stepping in to save her family last weekend

Lucky to be alive: Charlie was at her Los Angeles home with her two pup siblings and family when two people broke into the home. The three dogs chased the intruders into the street

The owner says Charlie is a hero and if she had not been in the line of fire, the bullets may have struck one of the family's children.

After police arrived, the pooch had to be taken by Animal Control to the North Central Shelter since her owners could not afford to get her to an emergency veterinarian on their own.

The technician who put Charlie up for the night reached out to the North Central Shelter Intervention Program, which helps owners find resources for their pets.

A crowdfunding page was set up to help get Charlie medical help and reunite her with her family.

More than $8,000 poured into the online bank account which was more than double the original goal.

'Please help us raise the funds to help this loyal and heroic dog get the care she needs. And reunite her with her family! She misses them very, very much Every little bit helps,' the shelter posted on the YouCaring funding site.

Cowardly act: One of the intruders fired shots at the pets as he ran away and struck Charlie in two of her legs, according to the North Central Shelter's Facebook page. One of the other dogs tried to push Charlie back inside the house after she was hurt

The plea was heard and Charlie successfully underwent surgery to have one of her legs amputated.

The family says she appears to be happy despite the trauma of last weekends' incident. She is now hobbling around on three legs perfectly well, licking and kissing her family once again.

Although the surgery cost significantly less than the $8,000 that was raised, the extra thousands of dollars in donations will go to the North Central Intervention Program to help other pet owners in the future

Further donations can be given Anyone who wants to donate to the program, they can visit Charlie's crowdfunding page or email ncintervention@gmail.com.
