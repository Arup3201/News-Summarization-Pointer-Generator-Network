Allegations: BA pilot Graeme Hindley, whose ex-lover says he wrote a lewd message into his cockpit computer and sent her a picture of it

A senior British Airways pilot has been accused of putting passengers at risk by sending lewd messages to his single-mother lover as he prepared to take off from Heathrow.

Graeme Hindley allegedly typed 'show us ur t**s' into the passenger jet's cockpit computer before taking a picture of the message on his phone and sending it to the mother of three.

Even as she begged him to concentrate on his work, the 43-year-old, who earns more than Â£100,000 a year, is said to have boasted he was 'not distractable', telling her 'I'm [a] total pro'.

The woman, who preferred not to be 
named and has since split from Mr Hindley after a brief fling, has now 
complained to BA about his 'apparent negligence'.

'It's
terrible Graeme should be sending messages on his phone and mucking 
about when he has got passengers on board relying on him,' she told The 
Sun.

'I thought I had a responsibility to the public to make them aware of Graeme's apparent negligence.'

The
woman claims Mr Hindley, who lives in the French Alps, sent the coarse 
message to her as he prepared to pilot a flight from Heathrow to 
Hannover in April.

He might 
have been expected to have been conducting vital pre-flight safety 
checks but, she claims, instead he was carrying on the conversation with
her via text and picture messages.

Realising
the implications of what he was doing, she begged him to put down his 
mobile and carry on with the task at hand, finally demanding: 'Get off 
your bloody phone.'

She said Mr Hindley had swept her off her feet with tales of his jet-setting lifestyle after meeting her on a ferry, but that he had turned cold after they twice met for sex.

She claimed that he told her they would 
be better of remaining just friends after their first liaison, but then 
later whisked her away to Monte Carlo and slept with her again at a 
hotel.

But she insists that her decision to out his alleged reckless behaviour was not a case of sour grapes.

'No
matter how he treated me he should be made aware of his 
responsibilities to the public who entrust their lives to him,' she told
The Sun.
