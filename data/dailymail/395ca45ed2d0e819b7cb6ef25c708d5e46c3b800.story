Kelly Osbourne, who attended yesterday's funeral, tweets that those talking on TV about Amy are 'not actual' friends

Overcome with grief, she was last seen curled in a ball unable to contain her emotions outside Amy Winehouse's home in Camden, north London.

Today, former Big Brother contestant Aisleyne Horgan-Wallace went on morning TV to talk about her 'wonderful, talented friend'.

However, the 32-year-old glamour model, who did not attend yesterday's private funeral, also revealed she has received messages of abuse over claims she encouraged Amy's wild ways.

She believes these come as a result of reports that appeared after Amy's death that neighbours had seen the singer fall out of a taxi after a night out with Aisleyne a few days earlier.

Aisleyne told told ITV's This Morning: 'A certain journalist said that I was
 seen with her a few days before... he also said that I need to ask 
myself what I was thinking, being in that situation with Amy when she 
was perhaps quite fragile.'

But she told that she had not seen the Back To Black singer for two months.

She added: 'The papers are saying the last time I was with her we were drinking. In fact the last time I was with her was in 
her house, in her kitchen, we were drinking tea and having a girlie gossip as I would with any friend. Just talking
 about guys.'

Aisleyne told hosts Eamonn Holmes and Ruth Langsford: 'It's devastating. I'm
 heartbroken anyway, losing Amy. I just want her back. But to have this 
thrown at me, and all the internet hate that I'm getting now.

'The messages have been just vile and it's hard because it's not true. There's not a scrap of 
truth in it.'

However, some dismissed the appearance as a publicity stunt by a woman whose career is flailing.

Kelly
 Osborne, a close friend of Amy's who went to yesterday's funeral, 
alluded to Aisleyne's appearance on Twitter, said some 'friends' are 
cashing in following the sudden death.

She said: 'Any 'friend' of amy's talking 2 the 
press/tv are not her actual friend's. her real friends have more dignity
 then to get $ 2 talk about her!'

Aisleyne was also asked if 
she had spoken to Amy about her battle with drugs and alcohol.

She said: 'I've dealt with addiction in my own family.

'It's hard to speak to the person about it. What I will say is, it's not glamorous it's not exciting. There are a lot of 
people suffering from addiction and the first step is to admit it.'

But she insisted Amy had beaten the battle.

'She got herself completely well and she did the impossible, which was to get 
clean.

'I'm just so proud of her for getting past it and overcoming it. She did the impossible as I say and she really did.'

Amy fans have taken to Twitter to vent their frustration about the interview.

One wrote: 'Didn't take my nemesis Aisleyne 
Hogan-Wallace long to cash in on the publicity of Amy Winehouse's death 
by appearing on This Morning, I see'.

Another said she was making the death 'all about her' while another wrote that she just wanted 'to be famous again'.

Aisleyne struggles to control her emotions outside Amy's home in Camden on Sunday

The jazz singer, 27, was found
 dead at her Camden home on Saturday.

Aisleyne was seen outside the house in floods of tears later that day. Unable to stand up, she fell to the ground and curled into a ball.

She said this morning she had earlier been with one of Amy's best friends who got a call about the death.

'She got the call and we went straight to the house. It didn't sink 
in. These things sort of comes in waves. You believe it and then you 
don't and then you think 'This is not real, it's not happening, she'll be fine'.'

Aisleyne and Amy struck up an unlikely friendship three years ago, with the pair regularly spotted together in London.

'We met years ago through a mutual friend,' Aisleyne said.

'She'd seen me on Big Brother, at my 
worst, and she wanted to meet me. Our mutual friend set it up. I was 
very honoured to meet her. When we met, we just clicked straight away and it was a friendship rather than being in awe of her.'

When asked about what Amy was like as a person, she was on the verge of tears.

'She's a fantastic woman who made everyone comfortable,' she said.

'She was very 
loving... Amy was a very homely girl and just loved to love.'

Aisleyne urged people to remember Amy for 'her amazing talent and how beautiful a person she was'.

Models on Aisleyne's Irish reality show Celebrity Salon are reported to have been comforting her following the death.
