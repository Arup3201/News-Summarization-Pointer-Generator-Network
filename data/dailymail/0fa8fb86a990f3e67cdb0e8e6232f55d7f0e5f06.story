British girls being taken abroad for forced marriages are being urged to hide spoons under their clothes in order to alert authorities to their plight.

As Britain puts airport staff on alert to spot potential victims, one campaigning group says the trick has saved some youngsters from coerced unions in South Asia.

The concealed cutlery sets off the metal detector at security control in Britain. Girls - and sometimes boys - can then be taken away from their parents to be searched, which gives them a last chance to seek help from airport staff.

Thousands of young women are being taken 'on holiday' to marry a stranger in a country they don't know

The British school summer holidays, now 
well under way, mark a peak in reports of young people - typically girls
aged 15 and 16 - being taken abroad on 'holiday', for marriage 
without consent, the government says.

The bleep at airport security may be the last chance they get to escape a union to someone they have never met in a country they have never seen.

The spoon trick is the brainchild of the Karma Nirvana charity, which supports victims and survivors of forced marriage and honour-based abuse.

Based in Derby, central England, it fields an average of 6,500 calls per year from around Britain. However, the organisation says this number has already been reached with another four and a half months to go until the end of 2013. It says this increase is due to increased awareness of the issue.

When petrified youngsters ring, 'if they don’t know exactly when it may happen or if it’s going to happen, we advise them to put a spoon in their underwear,' said Natasha Rattu, Karma Nirvana’s operations manager.

When the girls go though security, the spoon will set off the alarm - if 16 or over, they will be taken away to a safe space

When the spoon sets off an alarm, 'they will be taken to a safe space where they have that one last opportunity to disclose they’re being forced to marry,' Rattu told AFP.

'We’ve had people ring and tell us that it’s helped them and got them out of a dangerous situation. It’s an incredibly difficult thing to do with your family around you - but they won’t be aware you have done it. It’s a safe way.'

The charity is working with airports - so far London Heathrow, Liverpool and Glasgow, with Birmingham to come - to spot potential waring signs, such as one-way tickets, the time of year, age of the person and whether they look uncomfortable.

'These are quite general points, but there are things that if you look collectively lead you to believe something more sinister is going on,' said Rattu.

People who come forward can be escorted out of a secure airport exit to help outside.

Marriages without consent have led to suicides and so-called honour killings.

Officials fear the number of victims coming forward is just the tip of the iceberg, with few community leaders prepared to speak out and risk losing their support base.

One woman, whose identity has been protected by Essex Police in southeast England, was forced to get married in India.

She said she was threatened by her father 'because he said if I thought about running away he would find me and kill me'.

'I was shipped off with a total stranger.

'That night I was raped by my husband and this abuse continued for about eight and half years of my life.'

She eventually fled.

Last year, the Foreign Office’s Forced Marriage Unit dealt with some 1,500 cases - 18 per cent of them men.

A third of cases involved children aged under 17. The oldest victim was aged 71; the youngest just two.

The cases related to 60 countries: almost half were linked to Pakistan, 11 per cent to Bangladesh, eight per cent to India, and two per cent to Afghanistan. Other countries involved included Somalia, Turkey and Iraq.

Calls to Karma Nirvana tend to spike before the British school summer holidays and again at the end, said Rattu.

'The holidays are a really good time for young people to go missing because there is nobody accounting for where they are at school,' she said.

Since Ramadan ended last week, calls have risen again, including one from an 18-year-old who has fallen pregnant - her family is trying force her into marriage to conceal it.

Burdened by codes of 'izzat', or family honour, youngsters can be put under extreme physical and emotional pressure to marry relatives in a culture and country they were not brought up in.

If they refuse, they are often threatened with being thrown out of the family - or worse.

'It really takes a brave person to stand up against their family,' said Rattu.

'In June 2012, the Government announced that forced marriage will become a criminal offence and by doing so we are sending out a clear message that this brutal practice is totally unacceptable and will not be tolerated in the UK.

'The Forced Marriage Unit (FMU) provides direct assistance to victims as well as undertaking a full programme of outreach activity to practitioners and communities, to ensure that people who are in contact with victims are fully informed about how to approach such cases.  Statutory guidance is already available to support those agencies that exercise public functions to safeguard children or vulnerable adults.   

'This year the FMU is handing out "Marriage: it's your choice” cards, to all professionals across the UK, including airport staff, safeguarding professionals, teachers and NGOs.  These cards will provide victims and potential victims with key information, in addition to signposting them to where further confidential advice and support can be obtained.'
