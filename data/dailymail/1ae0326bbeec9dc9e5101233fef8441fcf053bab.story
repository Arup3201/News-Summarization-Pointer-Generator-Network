Foul-mouthed: Comedian Frankie Boyle has prompted complaints once more by posting a series of controversial messages on Twitter during the Paralympics opening ceremony

Outspoken comedian Frankie Boyle has again courted controversy after he joked that the Saudi Arabian Paralympic team were 'mainly thieves'.

The comment - a reference to how Saudis have amputated criminals' hands as punishment for stealing - was one of several provocative messages posted on twitter by the Scottish comic during the Paralympics opening ceremony.

He faced a backlash from other people who accused him of trying to undermine the sports extravaganza.

Boyle has appeared frequently in programmes shown on Channel 4, the broadcaster covering the Paralympics.

But his sketch show Tramadol Nights was axed by the station in January after a flood of complaints.

Boyle, who has almost 1million followers on Twitter, tweeted last night: 'Apparently the Saudi Arabian Paralympic team is mainly thieves #c4paralympics'.

Minutes earlier, he had written: 'Wow, Austrian Paralympians seem a lot more able-bodied than most regular Scottish people'.

And turning to his attention to the Queen, who opened the Paralympics at the Olympic Stadium in Stratford, east London, he tweeted: 'The Queen hasn't cracked a smile since Diana died #c4paralympics'.

Boyle later told his followers that he was feeling 'horny' as he watched the ceremony and added: 'I'd love to have the skill and dedication of some of these Paralympians, almost as much as I'd like to have their meds'.

London 2012 chairman Lord Coe was also lampooned by Boyle, who wrote: 'After all the trials they've gone through, these paralympians face their greatest challenge in trying to not look bored by Seb Coe'.

Provocative: The comedian made a joke about the death of Diana, Princess of Wales

The comment about Lord Coe was retweeted more than 300 times, but some found his brand of humour offensive.

One person wrote: 'Great work by @C4Paralympics bring on the games shame you have idiots like frankie Boyle undermining it with tweets poking fun #clueless'.

Another said: 'Frankie Boyle is flogging a dead horse on here tonight. Turn it in Frankie, we got it the first time.'

While a third had this to say: 'Had to unfollow Frankie Boyle. He can be hilarious but he's just uncalled for during the Paralympics'.

Backlash: Boyle's comments offended some Twitter users, one of whom accused the comedian of trying to undermine the Games

Boyle is no stranger to controversy, having mocked the appearance of Britain's Olympic gold-medal winning swimmer Rebecca Adlington on Twitter and television.

He tweeted: 'I worry that Rebecca Adlington will have an unfair advantage in the swimming by possessing a dolphin's face.'

In January Channel 4 pulled the plug on a second series of Tramadol Nights, as well as a planned chat show starring the comedian.

A pilot episode of the chat show, called Frankie Boyle’s Rehabilitation Programme, was filmed last year but the channel decided not to proceed with it.

The Tramadol Nights series prompted more than 500 complaints from the public after the comedian made controversial remarks last year about model Katie Price’s disabled son Harvey.
