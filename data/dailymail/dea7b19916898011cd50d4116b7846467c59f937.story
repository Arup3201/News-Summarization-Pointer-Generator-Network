Syrian president Bashar Assad is hiding his chemical weapons outside the country to prevent the deadly arsenal being destroyed, a rebel leader has claimed.

The dictator has been accused of moving his stockpiles across the border to Lebanon and Iraq to evade a possible inspection.

His forces were said to have acted after the US and Russia agreed to secure and eliminate the weapons – a deal hailed by Assad’s regime as a ‘victory’.

General Salim Idris, head of the 
Syrian opposition’s supreme  military council, said: ‘We have told our 
friends that the regime has begun moving a part of its chemical weapons 
arsenal to Lebanon and Iraq. We told them do not be fooled.’

He
 criticised the deal for allowing Assad to escape being held to account 
for killing hundreds of civilians, adding: ‘All of this initiative does 
not interest us. Russia is a partner with the regime in killing the 
Syrian people.

‘A crime 
against humanity has been committed and there is not any mention of 
accountability.’ His comments came after one of Assad’s ministers, Ali 
Haidar, claimed the deal was a victory for the regime.

He
 said: ‘On the one hand, it helps Syria come out of the crisis and on 
the other, it helps avoid war. It’s a victory for Syria.’

A government minister has praised 
their 'Russian friends' for brokering the deal which seeks to destroy 
Syria's chemical weapons by mid-2014, in exchange for America's 
agreement not to launch military strikes.

Under
 the agreement President al-Assad must turn over full details of the 
country's chemical weapons stockpile within a week, or face UN 
enforcement which could lead to further conflict. 

Speaking of the US-Russian deal, 
Syrian minister Ali Haidar said: 'These 
agreements ... are a victory for Syria, achieved thanks to our Russian 
friends.'

President 
Bashar al-Assad's jets and artillery hit rebel suburbs of the capital 
again on Sunday in an attack that residents said began last week, when 
President Obama delayed air strikes in the face of opposition from 
Moscow and his own electorate.

Reports
 indicate rebel brigades have expressed disdain for the American 
President and his government after shying away from military 
intervention against al-Assad's regime.

John Kerry however today sent a strong 
warning to Syria, insisting 'the threat of force is real' if it does not
 carry out an internationally-brokered agreement to hand over its 
chemical weapons.

The US Secretary of State issued the warning in Jerusalem, where he briefed jittery Israeli leaders on the new American-Russian plan to rid neighbouring Syria of its chemical weapons by mid-2014.

In comments aimed at his hosts, Mr 
Kerry said the deal also served as a ‘marker’ for the international 
community as it deals with Iran's suspect nuclear programme.

‘We cannot have hollow words in the conduct of international affairs,’ he added.

‘These are crimes against humanity and they cannot be tolerated,’
 Mr Kerry warned.

In
 a deal meant to avert a threatened US military strike, US and Russian 
officials reached an ambitious agreement over the weekend calling for an
 inventory of Syria's chemical weapons programme within one week.

All parts of Syria's chemical weapons programme will be removed from the country or destroyed by mid-2014.

The deal was greeted with cautious optimism in Israel, where leaders expressed satisfaction that Syria, a bitter enemy, could be stripped of dangerous weapons but also pessimism about whether Syrian President Bashar Assad will comply.

Israel has repeatedly voiced concern 
that Assad, locked in a two-year-old civil war, may fire his chemical 
weapons at Israel in a bout of desperation or that the weapons could 
fall into the hands of Hezbollah or other hostile groups fighting in the
 Syrian civil war.

Perhaps 
more critically, the Israelis also fear that a tepid international 
response to Syria could encourage Iran to press forward with what is 
widely believed to be a nuclear weapons program.

Iran denies its nuclear programme has a military purpose and says it is pursuing peaceful applications like cancer treatment and power generation.

Standing alongside Mr Kerry, Prime 
Minister Benjamin Netanyahu welcomed the US-Russia deal and stressed his
 belief that it would have deep repercussions on Iran, Syria's close 
ally.

‘The world needs to 
ensure that radical regimes don't have weapons of mass destruction 
because as we have learned in Syria if rogue regimes have weapons of 
mass destruction they will use them,’ Mr Netanyahu said.

‘The
 determination the international community shows regarding Syria will 
have a direct impact on the Syrian regime's patron Iran,' he 
added.

'Iran must 
understand the consequences of its continued defiance of the 
international community by its pursuit toward nuclear weapons.'
