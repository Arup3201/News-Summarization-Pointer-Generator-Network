What a difference a year makes. As he claps and toddles happily, few would suspect that little Dennie Dolan almost lost a finger when he was attacked in his home by a fox just a year ago.

Dennie was just five weeks old, when the urban fox sneaked inside, dragged him off a sofa and tried to pull him out of the house.

He was saved when his mother Hayley Cawley heard his screams and frantically followed a trail of blood to find the animal trying to drag him out through the front door. Hayley kicked out repeatedly until the fox released her son and ran away, never to be found.

Healing process: Dennie's hand now after a plastic surgeon reattached his finger in a five-hour operation after he was attacked by a fox at just five-weeks-old

Amazingly, Dennie – then just 10lb – has grown into an active and mischievous toddler, blissfully unaware of how close he came to death.

Nor does he know he owes the use of his tiny hand to the skill of surgeons who performed an emergency five-hour operation to save his finger. Today, the only clue to his ordeal are two tiny scars on his hand.

Hayley, 29, said: ‘Dennie is my little miracle boy. I can’t count the number of times each day I think about how blessed we’ve been.

‘He’s lively and charming with 
sparkling blue eyes. But his birthday brought up a lot of emotions. It 
was hard not to be reminded of how close we came to losing him.’

Hayley
 shivered as she recalled the day in February when she put her infant 
son on the settee and went upstairs. Moments later, she heard him cry 
out and dashed down to soothe him – only to find he was no longer on the
 sofa.

In
 a panic, Hayley spotted her baby’s blood and then the fox – with 
Dennie’s arm in its mouth – moving towards the front porch of their home
 in Bromley, South London.

Dennie had gashes, weals and bruises on his 
head and was bleeding heavily from his hand.

‘Dennie’s finger was literally dangling backwards on to the back of his hand,’ she added.

‘The
 fox had not cut through the bone but there seemed to be very little 
skin – or anything else – left keeping the finger attached to his hand. I
 couldn’t look at it so I covered his hand up with his jumper until 
paramedics came.

The Mail on Sunday's report of the attack

‘It was the most horrible experience of my life.

‘I still have nightmares about it and to this day I can’t let Dennie out my sight. He even sleeps in my bedroom in a cot so I can be nearby at all times.

‘If that fox had been able to get him through the door, we might not have seen him again. People would have suspected that I’d killed him.’

Dennie was rushed to the Evelina Children’s Hospital in South London, where plastic surgeon Jian Farhadi and his team operated to re-attach the third finger on his left hand.

Hayley said: ‘For several days afterwards the finger was black.

‘We
 spent a week in hospital and were delighted when we started to see the 
colour coming back into Dennie’s finger. When the bandages came off in 
May, his finger was working perfectly.

‘For
 Dennie, it was like nothing had happened. He was waving his hands 
around and not long after that he was using them to crawl.

‘He’s
 regained all feeling. The only reminder we have is the scar at the base
 of his finger and some scarring above his wrist from a fox bite.

‘All the marks on his head have healed, but Dennie has a lot of trouble sleeping on his own. He screams if I leave him in his bedroom and will cry even if leave him in his pushchair. I do wonder if the attack has left him scared of being alone.’

Hayley believes the fox got into their home after her fiance Paul Dolan, 28, went out to collect their other children, Ellouise, ten, and Lee, six, without checking whether the door was closed correctly.

‘We felt so responsible for what had happened as parents,’ she said. ‘I don’t think that will ever go away, but we realise now that it was a freak accident.

‘We don’t even blame the fox – it was an animal doing what animals do. As for Dennie, he’s my little hero. He’s 23lb and is very strong. He keeps me on my toes all day – but I wouldn’t have it any other way.’
