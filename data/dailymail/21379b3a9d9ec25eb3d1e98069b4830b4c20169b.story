A murderer shows he has no shame as he raises his middle finger - on the day he admitted brutally stabbing his ex-girlfriend to death.

Asher Maslin, 22, made the vulgar gesture as he was being driven away to life in jail after pleading guilty to killing hairdresser Hollie Gazzard while she was working.

Maslin knifed the 20-year-old 14 times in front of horrified colleagues as she worked at Fringe Benefits and La Bella Beauty salon in Gloucester city centre.

Police say Maslin purchased a knife 
before heading to the salon after the pair had separated. He pleaded 
guilty to the killing during a hearing at Bristol Crown Court.

Miss Gazzard was nearing the end of her shift when she was brutally set upon.

During the
 attack in February, and as paramedics and police officers desperately tried to save
 the 20-year-old’s life, bystanders were filming on their mobile phones. Police later warned them not to upload the pictures to social media sites.

In the run-up to her death, Miss Gazzard had used her Twitter account to hint at her on/off relationship with an ex-boyfriend.

One
 tweet, written last December, said: “Why are people so selfish?! If a 
person isn’t happy within the relationship why try and make them stay?!”

Another, a retweet sent just a few weeks before she died, said: 'Sometimes holding on is a sign of weakness.'

Following her death, Miss Gazzard’s family said 'the brightest star' in their lives had gone out.

A post-mortem examination found she died from multiple stab wounds.

The 
Independent Police Complaints Commission (IPCC) has launched an 
investigation into Gloucestershire Police’s contact with Miss Gazzard 
before her death.

Miss
 Gazzard’s family - including her father Nick, 49, mother Mandy, 46, and
 elder sister Chloe, 23 - sat in the public gallery to see Maslin enter 
his plea.

Maslin, who wore a black knitted jumper and dark trousers, spoke only to confirm his name and plead guilty.

Peter
 Blair QC, defending, said the delay in Maslin entering his plea was to 
see whether there were any psychiatric issues in the case but the court 
heard there were not.

He asked that Maslin not be sentenced before June 23.

Prosecutor Stephen Mooney did not open the case against Maslin.

Judge
 Neil Ford QC, the Recorder of Bristol, remanded Maslin into custody and
 said he was likely to be sentenced by a High Court judge.

Hollie Gazzard's family described her as 'a popular and much-loved young woman' adding that the 'very public nature of her death has affected a great many people across the community'

He told Maslin: 'Your sentencing will take place on a date to be fixed in the relative near future.

'You appreciate that the only sentence that can be imposed is one - imprisonment for life.

'It will be for the sentencing judge to determine the minimum term you will serve before you become eligible for parole.

'In the meantime you will be remanded into custody.'

Maslin, of Benhall Gardens, Cheltenham, had been due to go on trial at Gloucester Crown Court on July 14.

Miss Gazzard’s family did not wish to speak after the hearing.

But
 Detective Chief Inspector Steve Bean, the senior investigating officer,
 said: ‘This was a spiteful and cowardly attack by a self-obsessed 
individual who couldn’t handle rejection.

'I think Maslin realised he didn’t have a chance but he pleaded guilty as the evidence was overwhelming.'

Shocking: Maslin stabbed his ex-girlfriend 14 times in a 'cowardly' attack in front of her work colleagues

He said Maslin purchased a knife and went to the salon to attack her.

'Maslin, following a domestic split, purchased a knife and went to Hollie’s place of work. They had a row and he stabbed her 14 times,' he said.

'He has shown no remorse, he made a ‘no comment’ interview and has not shown any kind of feeling or emotion.

'There were a couple of previous, fairly minor, domestic incidents, and nothing to indicate what he went on to do.'

'This murder happened in such a public place and those witnesses were severely traumatised by what they saw.

'Giving evidence in court can be a traumatic experience, particularly when they have experienced such a horrific event, so it is a relief they don’t have to recall events in a courtroom.'

Miss Gazzard's family paid tribute to the young hairdresser following her death on February 18.

'She was full of life and we are very proud of her. She was at the beginning of her life and to have it taken away in this manner is very hard to bear,' they said.

'The world has lost a treasure, she was so loved by all her family and friends and the brightest star in their lives has now gone out.'

Since Miss Gazzard’s death, her family have set up a charitable trust in her name, to sponsor the training of young hairdressers and contribute towards the fight against domestic violence.

She started work in the hairdressing industry aged 16 after being offered an apprenticeship on leaving school.

In April, hundreds of people took part in a walk from Gloucester to Cheltenham to raise money for the charitable trust.
