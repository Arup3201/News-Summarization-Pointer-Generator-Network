An accountant has spent £25,000 on what she describes as her plastic surgery 'hobby' in a bid to get her dream body - all before her 25th birthday.

Maddison Hawk, who had her ears pinned back at the age of six, claims the success of the surgery at that young age inspired her to give her entire body an overhaul.

Soon after, she drew up a list of treatments and operations she wanted and, as soon as she turned 18, spent more than £2,000 on semi-permanent make up.

Big spender: Maddison Hawk has spent £25,000 on what she describes as her plastic surgery 'hobby' in a bid to get her dream body - all before her 25th birthday

Makeover: Maddison Hawk has spent £23,000 on cosmetic surgery to look a million dollars, drawing up a list of treatments and operations she wanted and as soon as she turned 18, including chemical peels, countless lip fillers, regular teeth whitening and then eventually a £4,800 boob job boosting her from a 32C to a busty 32H

Next came a host of chemical peels, countless lip fillers, regular teeth whitening and then, at the age of 23, came a £4,800 breast enhancement, boosting her from a 32C to a 32H.

Despite being a svelte size 12, Maddison booked in for liposuction on her tummy - and at the last minute decided to have the fat sucked from her whole body. 

Now a size eight, she insists her looks are worth every penny and has vowed to continue having surgery until she has the perfect body.

Maddison, from Witney, Oxfordshire, said: 'After I had my ears done I got a taste for altering my body.

Striving for perfection: Now a size eight, she insists her looks are worth every penny and has vowed to continue her surgery hobby until she has the perfect body

'I didn't see why you had to accept the way you were made, when there were so many treatments and surgeries available.

'I wanted to change the way I looked and started plotting - as soon as I was old enough, I was going to make some big changes.

'I don't believe that you have to accept the way you were born, I think it's fine to pay for changes to your body.

'And besides, what's the difference between wearing make up and having liposuction? It's all just tinkering!'

Changing face: Maddison, pictured, left, now and, right, before all the treatments, had tattooed make-up on her eyes, eyebrows and lips costing £600 - plus £1,600 for top-ups a year later all from the age of 18

Work in progress: Maddison, whose obsession started when she had her ears pinned back as a youngster, said she didn't see why you have to accept the way you were made when there's so many treatments and surgeries available to change the way you look

Maddison's obsession began when her mother Alison, 50, took her to have her ears pinned back because she was worried her daughter would be bullied at school.

At 18, she had make-up tattooed on her eyes, eyebrows and lips costing £600 - plus £1,600 for top-ups a year later.

Three years later she spent £750 on three chemical face peels and £3,500 on lip fillers over a year.

Aged 23, she had her £4,800 breast enhancement, followed by £4,000 laser eye surgery, £1,100 teeth whitening, and laser hair removal on her legs and underarms for £600.

But her biggest operation came in April last year when she had full body liposuction in April, costing £5,000.

Petite Maddison said: 'I'd tried diet and exercise but nothing I did got rid of my pot belly. I decided lipo was the only answer.

'My surgeon agreed to lipo my tummy but said I didn't really need it on my arms or legs.

'But I said "just go the whole hog". While I was under anaesthetic, why not? I woke up in absolute agony.

'It was the most pain I've ever been in, but I recovered quickly and loved the results, going from a size 12 to a size eight.

'Of course it hurt - I'd had the fat sucked out of me - but no pain, no gain!'

Maddison, who has no debt, insists that she doesn't regret any of her surgery, which she pays for from her wages as an accountant and hair extensions business.

She plans to have her boobs lifted, and more laser eye surgery, as well as Botox in the future.

'A nip here, a tuck there, I don't see what the big deal is,' she said.

'The way I see it, I'm £25,000 more beautiful than I was before.

'I work hard to afford my hobby. I don't go out every weekend but when I do go out, I want to show off my body.

'There's no point spending all this money if I can't show off the results

'I know I've spent a fortune on my looks - but some women spend the same amount on going out and they have nothing to show for it. I prefer to go to the hospital for another upgrade, than to the pub.'
