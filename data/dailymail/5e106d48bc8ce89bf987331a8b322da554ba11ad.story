The second day of the prestigious Westminster Kennel Club dog show is under way today at Manhattan's Madison Square Garden, bringing together the world's top dogs as they battle it out for the title of Best in Show.

Winners in each breed category so far, who will go head-to-head in tonight's finals, include a Shih Tzu called Rocket, who belongs to heiress Patty Hearst, and a fluffy Poodle named Flame.

One of this year's show favorites, Matisse the Portuguese Water Dog - a three-year-old cousin to President Obama's puppy, Sunny - raised eyebrows with a rather unusual new haircut, which left a sizable portion of his backside closely-shaven.

A staggering 192 breeds have entered the two-day competition, which is in its 139th year and is second only to the Kentucky Derby in its longevity, flocking from 48 states in the U.S. and from 14 countries worldwide. 

Judges yesterday and today are selecting the best of each breed and group, divided into
seven categories; hound, toy, non-sporting, herding, sporting,
working and terrier.

On Monday, a bouncy 15-inch Beagle named Miss P was selected to represent the hound group, and chosen to head the toy group was Ms Hearst's Shih Tzu, Rocket, who wore a sparkling ponytail. 

Ms Shaw (full name Patricia Hearst Shaw) is a publishing heiress made famous in
the 1970s for being kidnapped by and then apparently joining an
American revolutionary group called the Symbionese Liberation
Army.

Won't he get cold? Matisse, who is the top-winning canine of his breed nationwide, will compete for best in the working group tonight

Pick me! The impressive pooch galloped along very gracefully considering he could barely see through his afro 

Pom pom paws: A dark and puffy standard poodle named Flame was also a group winner on Monday, and will represent the non-sporting group in the finals

Finalists: On Monday, a bouncy 15-inch Beagle named Miss P (left) was selected to represent the hound group, and for the herding group, a friendly 110lb Old English Sheepdog called Swagger (right) was picked

Good odds: Swagger, pictured getting groomed at the show today, came second overall last year

Supreme: Last year's winner was Sky, a Wire Fox Terrier formally known as GCH Afterall Painting the Sky (pictured)

A dark and puffy standard poodle named Flame was also a
group winner on Monday, and will represent the non-sporting
group. For the herding group, the friendly 110lb Old English Sheepdog called Swagger - who came second overall last year - was picked.

Sporting, working and terrier groups are judged this evening.

Miss P, Swagger and Matisse are considered this year's show favorites, and Matisse will compete
for best in the working group tonight.

Those selected as the best in their groups compete for the
ultimate Best in Show prize, which comes with a trophy and a media tour, and was won last year by Sky, a wire fox
terrier from California.

This winner will be determined by The Hon. David Merriam of Bonsall, California, who heads up a panel of 32 other judges.

Golden retrievers made up the largest breed group this year, with 58 of them competing, followed by 56 Labradors, 41 French Bulldogs and 38 Cavalier King Charles Spaniels.

There was only one White Bull Terrier and one Norwegian Lundehund on the entry list this year.

Contrary to the popularity of Labradors, as well as Dachshunds, Dalmatians and Chihuahuas as pets, none of these breeds have ever won at WKC.

The show will be broadcast tonight on USA Network from 8-11pm EST.
