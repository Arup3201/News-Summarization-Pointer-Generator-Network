With his parole hearing scheduled for later this week, convicted cop killer Bruce Lorick is ready to regain his freedom - and fall in love.

The 57-year-old inmate has spent more than 30 years in prison for the 1980 killing of New York City police officer Joseph Keegan.

On Saturday, Lorick will appear before a Manhattan parole board for the fifth time and make a case for his release.

While awaiting the hearing, the lovelorn Clinton Correctional Facility inmate has joined the dating website meet-an-inmate.com hoping to find women 'for friendship or possibly more,' according to his post, which first caught the attention of the New York Daily News. 

In his profile, the cold-blooded cop killer describes himself in glowing terms as a 'Black male who is childless, single, humorous, witty, loyal, a good listener, and an excellent lover.'

On paper, Lorick is quite the catch: a brown-eyed, 5-foot-10, 180-lbs college-educated military veteran from a Protestant background whose many interests include books, music, art, movies, horses, 'and mostly anything involving a woman.'

And based on his dating profile, Lorick is not the least bit picky when it comes to choosing a mate.

‘Your race, weight, and looks are not important to me because all women have something special about them, plus I am looking for love instead of trying to find faults in you,’ he writes.

‘I have no hidden identities, so you can be yourself without fear or shame, as I have learned that people are not perfect, just human beings.’

The post is accompanied by a photo of Lorick sitting on a bench in a green prison jumpsuit with a 'come hither' look in his eyes.  

While Lorick seems to be very confident that Friday's hearing will go his way, the victim’s family have vowed to do everything in their power to keep the convicted killer behind bars for the rest of his life.

On June 13, 1980, transit officer Joseph Keegan, 41, stopped 22-year-old Bruce Lorick at the 59th-Street Columbus Circle subway station for failing to pay the fare.

When Keegan went to arrest Lorick, a struggle ensued and the suspect grabbed the officer's service weapon and shot him in the head.

Keegan was just 44 days from an early retirement. He had been planning to quit the force after 15 years so he could start a family.

A year later, Lorick was convicted of murder and sentenced to life in prison.

He became eligible for parole in 2005, but every time he made a plea for freedom, his request was denied.

Last month, 40 of Keegan's family members showed up at the state parole office in Manhattan and handed in their impact statements asking to keep Bruce Lorick incarcerated.

‘My uncle was executed,’ Noreen Keegan Connelly, the officer’s niece, told the New York Post last month.

Lorick's profile on meet-an-inmate is not his first foray into the world of online dating.

In 2005, around the time of his first parole hearing, he posted a personnel ad on the site prisonerlife.com looking for a woman between the ages 30-57 'who is unafraid of being herself and desire [sic] to be loved totally.'

A decade ago, Lorick described his ideal life partner as a Christian woman who is not a 'fanatic.'

Keegan's relatives, among them more than a dozen cops, were infuriated by his killer’s audacity.

His niece was also outraged when Keegan offered her a sum of money last year in exchange for her willingness to drop her opposition to his parole bid.

‘Of course I declined because there’s no dollar value on my uncle’s life or anyone’s life. He has no remorse and really no regard for human life,’ Connelly told CBS New York.
