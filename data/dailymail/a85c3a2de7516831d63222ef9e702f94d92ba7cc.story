Hope Solo's husband was driving a US women's soccer team van when he was arrested on suspicion of DUI, reports claim. 

Solo, 33, was in the car when former Seattle Seahawks tight end Jerramy Stevens, 36, was pulled over in Manhattan Beach, California, at about 1.30am on Monday for driving without headlights.  

Solo has since been suspended from the national squad for 30 days, forcing her to miss matches next month in Europe. 

Although U.S. Soccer did not specify the reason for the suspension announced last night, TMZ understands it was connected to the fact that Stevens was driving a team van.

The reason for the suspension, announced on Wednesday night, was not specified but comes after an incident at training camp

The goalkeeper was reportedly almost arrested for disorderly conduct after she became 'belligerent' while officers conducted the traffic stop. 

She was in Southern California for training camp with the U.S. national team, which is preparing to play in the World Cup starting in June.

Coach Jill Ellis said in a statement: 'During our current national team camp, Hope made a poor decision that has resulted in a negative impact on U.S. Soccer and her teammates,' 

'We feel at this time it is best for her to step away from the team.'

Solo, who has won two Olympic gold medals with the U.S. team, was released from camp.

In a statement, she told the Associated Press: 'I accept and respect the Federation's decision, and more importantly, I apologize for disappointing my teammates, coaches and the Federation who have always supported me.

'I think it's best for me to take a break, decompress from the stress of the last several months, and come back mentally and physically ready to positively contribute to the team.'

Domestic violence charges against Solo were dismissed after she was arrested for assaulting her nephew and her sister during an allegedly drunken brawl. 

The charges stemmed from an altercation with her half-sister and 17-year-old nephew at a party in Washington last June.

Solo had pleaded not guilty in that case, and she continued to play for the U.S. team and with her National Women's Soccer League team, the Seattle Reign, while awaiting trial.

Her last appearance with the national team was in December, when she started in a scoreless draw against Brazil in the championship game of the 2014 International Tournament of Brasilia.

Last September, in an exhibition victory over Mexico, Solo logged her 72nd shutout, passing Briana Scurry (1994-2008) on national team's career list.

The suspension comes at a critical time for the U.S. team.

Following the exhibition matches in February, the team will play in the Algarve Cup in March. The team will open World Cup play on June 8 against Australia in Winnipeg, Manitoba.

An expanded field of 24 teams will compete in the World Cup, which will be played in six Canadian cities. The United States is in Group D, which also includes Sweden and Nigeria.

The U.S. women, currently ranked No. 2 in the world behind Germany, are seeking their third World Cup title but first since 1991.

Solo will be eligible for reinstatement after the suspension, pending review and approval by U.S. Soccer and Ellis, U.S. Soccer said.
