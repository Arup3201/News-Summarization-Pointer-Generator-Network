A mother has been fined £400 because her son missed a day of school nearly nine years ago because he had severe headaches as a result of an undiagnosed brain tumour.

Darilyn Rothwell, 51, from Radcliffe, Manchester, was given just seven days to pay the fine which was issued because her 24-year-old son Chris Barlow was off sick when he was a teenager in November 2004.

She claims she had informed the school that her son, who had to take several sick days in the months before his diagnosis, was ill but she was fined for his 'truancy' anyway.

Upset: The fine has been upsetting for Mrs Rothwell as it has also brought back bad memories of her son's battle with cancer

Mr Barlow, who now has three children
of his own, collapsed with seizures in January 2005 and was on a life 
support machine for three days at Royal Bolton Hospital.

He was diagnosed with a brain tumour and underwent numerous operations. 

Mrs
Rothwell was taken to court by Bolton Council later that year after 
education bosses claimed she was not doing enough to get her son back to
lessons at Harper Green School in Farnworth after his treatment.

The case was thrown out by magistrates and Mrs Rothwell assumed that was the end of the matter.

However,
she has now been issued with a letter by debt recovery firm Marston 
Group, who were acting on instruction from HM Courts & Tribunal Service, ordering her to pay a £405 court fine within seven days.

If
the mother-of-three does not pay the fine she has been threatened with 
bailiffs coming to her house and the sale of her possessions by public 
auction.

A spokesman for the council claimed 
the fine related to a case when Mrs Rothwell was found guilty in her 
absence of allowing her son to be truant.

But she claims she was only aware of 
the later case which she attended and that she 'had never heard 
anything' about the earlier hearing or the fine until last week.

Demand: Mrs Rothwell was sent a letter from Marston, acting on the instruction of HM Courts & Tribunals Service, asking for the £405 fine

She said: 'When Chris first started getting headaches I first thought he was a typical teenager blagging to try to get time off school but he was in tears with the pain.

'We thought it was migraines and the doctors put it down to migraines too.

'I called the school every time Chris was sick so I don't know why this has been put down as an unauthorised absence.

'I would have thought I would have got a letter about this from the court, but I have never heard anything about this fine before until the letter landed on my doorstep last week.'

Mr Barlow was in hospital for five weeks after he collapsed and then spent two years undergoing treatment.

Doctors cannot operate on the benign tumour in his brain and he will have to take medication and attend regular check-ups for the rest of his life.

Since receiving the debt collection 
order this week, Mrs Rothwell said she has been unable to sleep as it 
has brought back memories of the difficult time.

'It’s eight years (since Chris was in hospital) now and we get hit by this from absolutely nowhere. It’s not just the financial stress of being told we’ve got to find this money but it brings all those awful memories back up again.

'As far as we’re concerned there’s no fine to be paid, but even if there was it seems bizarre that after hearing nothing for eight years we suddenly get a letter saying we’ve got to pay this money within seven days or face further action.'

The Courts and Tribunal Service, which is responsible for the collection of fines ordered by courts in the UK, said today it was looking into whether the order had been made in error.

A spokesman said: 'We are investigating this incident as a matter of urgency. The family have been advised no further action will be taken until our investigation has concluded.'

Parents of children who persistently truant can be fined, ordered to do community service or even jailed.

The numbers of parents prosecuted has risen from under 4,000 in 2005 to 12,800 in 2011 as the Government has cracked down on truancy.

This year the Government introduced on-the-spot fines of £60 - rising to £120 if they fail to pay on time - to parents whose children miss school.

Department of Education figures suggest around 43,000 pupils fail to attend school on any given day.

Around 7 per cent of schoolchildren, the equivalent of 450,000 pupils, missed around a month of lessons in 2010-11.
