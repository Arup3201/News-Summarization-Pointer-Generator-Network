A new blood test for prostate cancer could spare thousands of men unnecessary treatment.

The test, which could cost less than £2, could distinguish between cancers that are life-threatening and those which are comparatively harmless.

Although prostate cancer is by far the most common form of cancer in men, with around 41,000 new cases and 10,700 deaths each year, many sufferers do not need treatment.

Breakthrough: A single protein can be used to distinguish aggressive prostate cancer from that which can be managed. Scientists hope the discovery will revolutionise treatment of the disease

Three quarters of them have slow-growing tumours that need nothing more than to be monitored.

But until now there have been no reliable tests to distinguish between harmless cancers and the deadly aggressive varieties.

Tens of thousands of men undergo surgery, chemotherapy or radiotherapy simply as a precaution – which often leaves them incontinent and their sexual desire severely impaired.

The new blood test developed by scientists at Cambridge University assesses the level of the protein NAALADL2, which is very high in men with aggressive cancers and causes prostate cancer cells to spread to other organs.

Research published in the journal Oncogene found that the protein test could correctly distinguish the aggressive tumours.

The scientists hope that the test will be available on the NHS in the next five to ten years. Clinical trials will begin next year.

Dr Hayley Whitaker, lead author of the study, said: ‘At the moment, men with prostate cancer have a lot of very difficult decisions to make based on not very much evidence.

‘This test would run on technology which is already routinely used in the NHS. It would cost a couple of pounds, maximum.’

Referring to her research, she said: ‘This is an important step along the path to developing a much-sought-after test that could distinguish between different types of prostate cancer.’

At present, men are given the prostate-specific antigen (PSA) test. It measures levels of a different type of protein, which are normally raised if a tumour is present.

Specialists also look at the cells under x-ray to try to determine how quickly they are growing – but experts say both methods are inadequate.

Dr Iain Frame, Director of Research at Prostate Cancer UK, said: ‘Being able to distinguish aggressive from non-aggressive prostate cancers could transform the outlook for the 40,000 men who are faced with a diagnosis of the disease every year.

‘The current diagnostic process is at best inadequate.

‘All too often men are faced with the difficult decision of whether to endure life-changing side effects from treatment for cancers which may never have caused them any harm. Others, however, are left with more aggressive cancers that are untreated until it’s too late.

‘If we are to save more of the 10,000 men who lose their lives to this disease every year, this urgently needs to be addressed.’

Professor Malcolm Mason, Cancer Research UK’s prostate cancer expert, who is based at the University of Cardiff, said: ‘As a prostate cancer clinician, I have been waiting for years for a test that can define the aggressive disease.

‘I hope that this research brings forward the day when I can say to patients, “We know that your cancer doesn’t need treatment” – a crucial development that could spare thousands of patients from enduring arduous treatment with unpleasant side effects.

‘This extremely interesting study provides an important development for prostate cancer screening, and potentially even reveals a new target for the development of new prostate cancer drugs in the future.’

n THE number of children beating cancer has risen to more than eight in ten, according to figures from Cancer Research UK.

In the 1960s, only three in ten survived after diagnosis, said a spokesman for the charity.

Survival rates for liver and bone tumours have made ‘particularly good progress’, with five-year survival rates increasing from 67 to 82 per cent for liver tumours and 61 to 68 per cent for bone cancer.

But he warned there is ‘still some way to go’ with other forms of the disease.

There are higher levels of the protein NAALADL2 in aggressive tumours

Doctors can identify tumours that are likely to pose a 
deadly threat

Currently
 the aggressiveness of a tumour can only be loosely identified

This means 
some patients have debilitating treatment that is not necessary
