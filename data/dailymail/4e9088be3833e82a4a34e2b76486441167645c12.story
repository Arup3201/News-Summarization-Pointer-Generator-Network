An 84-year-old woman is celebrating 70 years of working in the Mars factory making the chocolate bar - and admits she still enjoys a Mars a day.

Audrey Cook was thrown a surprise party by colleagues to mark her seven decades at the factory, based in Dundee Road, Slough.

She is thought to be the longest-serving worker in the food and drink industry.

Her first job in 1944 aged 14 was cutting Mars bars in the ‘stripping room’ before moving onto the confectionery production before her current role running the staff shop.

Audrey, from Slough, joined the company straight from school earning £2 (6s) per week.

She counts the highlight of her career as meeting the Queen and the Duke of Edinburgh when they visited the factory last year.

Ms Cook made the headlines in national newspapers after Prince Philip cracked a joke about her former job in the stripping room.

'I love working here, it’s a great company,' she said. 'I’ve enjoyed meeting so many people over the years. Meeting the Queen is definitely the best thing that’s happened to me since working at Mars, it was such an honour.'

She added: 'It’s another wonderful story to tell my family about my career at Mars.'

Ms Cook was given a Mars-themed cake, a book of tributes and photographs at the anniversary bash.

Fiona Dawson, president of Mars Chocolate UK, also paid tribute to the long-serving employee.

'We have been making chocolate in Slough for over 80 years and are incredibly lucky that Audrey has been here almost from the start,' she said.

She says that the Mars bar is her absolute favourite treat and she eats one with a cup of tea every morning

'She is truly remarkable, a wonderful associate, who embodies the culture of Mars and lights up everyone’s day with her infectious smile and wicked sense of humour.'

Ms Cook started off cutting Mars bars by hand, before joining Spangles production and later becoming supervisor on the Opal Fruits (now Starburst) production line. She moved to the staff shop in 1972, where she has worked ever since.

When asked what the biggest changes she has witnessed are, she said: 'Everything is automatic now. There are so many more people working at Mars, doing so many different jobs.'

But one thing has not changed during her time: 'The Mars Bar is my absolute favourite. I eat one with a cup of tea every morning,' she added.

Mars Bar has been made in the factory where Audrey works in Slough, Berkshire since 1932 - three million are made there every single day.

Forrest Mars, the son of American candy maker Frank C. Mars, established the factory with just 12 members of staff and began making the chocolate bar consisting of nougat and caramel covered in milk chocolate.

It was modelled on his father's Milky Way bar, which was a confectionery hit in the US.

During the war years, the bars were allocated to troops in the UK and to prisoners of war in Germany.

In 1991, the bars were exported to Russia for the first time. Demand was so high that they had to be rationed to four per person.

In 2002, the Mars Bar was reformulated and the nougat made lighter and the chocolate on top thinner, which was met by outrage.

In 2006, the UK versions were renamed 'Believe' bars as a gesture of support for the England football team during the FIFA World Cup in Germany.

In 2013, the company said the decision to reduce Mars from 58g to 51g and Snickers from 58g to 48g was part of a pledge to cut the calorie count of its products to a maximum of 250.

In 1944, a Mars bar cost just 6p - today, it's priced from 50p.
