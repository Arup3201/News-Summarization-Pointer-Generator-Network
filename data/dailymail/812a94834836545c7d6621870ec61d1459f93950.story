A seven-year-old who suffered from blisters so painful they stopped her eating and blinking, has found out she is allergic to a long list of household products, including soap and shampoo.

Niamh McGroarty would erupt in rashes and blisters on her body, some so severe they would prevent her from opening her mouth, and for years the family had no clue as to what caused it.

Niamh and her mother Sheila Armstrong, 29, from Birmingham, West Midlands, now know the little girl is allergic to a common preservative, known as MI.

Reactions: Niamh McGroarty, pictured with her mother Sheila Armstrong, is allergic to preservative Methylisothiazolinone (MI), which can be found in household products such as shampoo, paint and glue

Niamh has suffered prolonged flare ups since the age of four, but it has only been the past few months that the family have realised the cause of her allergic reactions.

Niamh now must avoid a huge list of everyday and household products such as soap, shampoo, sun cream, baby wipes, glue and paint.

Ms Armstrong said: ‘Niamh has had severe reactions regularly since the age of four, which can last up to a month. There is no cure.

‘She is in a lot of pain and has gone days without eating because her mouth has been so cracked and sore.

‘For years we didn’t know what was causing Niamh’s flare ups and she was suffering more and more. The doctors thought it was impetigo, but the cream they gave her just made the reaction worse.’

She adds: ‘It is a nightmare because this cheap preservative is in virtually everything.

‘There is no treatment to stop it- we just have to keep checking everything she comes into contact with.

Allergy: Niamh, seven, would get blisters and severe rashes all over her body, particularly on her face

‘I have to make sure Niamh takes her own sheets if she goes to stay at a friend’s house and she knows not to use any soaps or even towels in other people’s houses.

Sheila believes baby wipes were the original cause of Niamh’s allergy and from then on she has flared up after contact with any other products, sometimes even resulting in overnight stays in hospitals.

Sheila said: ‘We are just so relieved to now know what is causing her reactions. As a mother it breaks my heart to see her suffer, especially when she began being bullied because of the rash on her face.

Niamh’s allergy is so bad she can even have a flare up weeks after contact with a product.

She said: ‘It breaks my heart to see Niamh suffer but she has come to terms with it now.

‘I just want to know why our children’s heath is being risked at the expense of saving money.’

Silver lining: After years of allergic reactions, the family finally knows what is causing Niamh's flareups and can avoid the preservative

Niamh has now learnt how the say the full name of the preservative, Methylisothiazolinone, so she can let others know about her allergy.

Niamh said: ‘I have to make sure I check everything I use now. Even the paints and glue at school can cause my face to flare up.

‘I just have to be careful now.’

Sheila and husband John, 40 are now worried about paint they used to decorate their house with, months before they knew the cause of Niamh’s allergy.

Sheila said: ‘We have just painted our house but now I have found out MI is in wall paint as well, so I am worried the paint will spark a reaction in Niamh.

‘There are no ingredients on the back of the tin, so I am desperate to find out whether it contains MI.

‘It’s not something we can just brush under the carpet- life will be harder for Niamh, but she is brave and has comes to terms with it, and is learning how to manage her allergy every day.’
