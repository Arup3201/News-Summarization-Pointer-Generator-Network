An ivory toothbrush belonging to the last emperor of Brazil is among 200,000 objects that have been unearthed at an excavation site in Rio de Janeiro.

A team of archeologists has been painstakingly scrapping away the soil at the site in the north of the capital, near the former imperial palace, ever since it was discovered by engineers building an extension to the underground rail network.

The haul, which contains artefacts spanning the 17th to 19th century, also includes minty toothpaste made by a chemist in Europe for the Queen of Portugal, Maria of Saboiai, a water bottle made for the Royal Family, and vessels still full of unidentified liquids.

Last emperor: Dom Pedro II, the Magnanimous

Brazil's last monarch, Dom Pedro II, was born in Rio in 1825, the seventh child of Dom Pedro I.

He
came to the throne at the tender age of just six, when his 
father suddenly abdicated and left the country for Europe.

A slavery abolitionist, Dom Pedro II came to be known simply as the Magnanimous during the course of his reign.

Although
many Brazilian landowners at the time owned slaves, Dom Pedro II was not 
one of them, and in 1871 he presided over a bill that ruled all children
born to slave women would be free.

But
during the 1880s there was a groundswell of support among civilian 
republicans to overthrow the monarchy, and in 1889 a coup d'etat was 
launched.

It led to tje abdication of Dom Pedro II and his
family, who went into exile in Europe.

The last emperor of Brazil died two years later in 1891.

More than two dozen archeologists and historians have been working at the site since it was first discovered in March.

The plot was once home to a slaughterhouse, and is also believed to have been used by the Imperial Family as a rubbish tip.

Team leader Claudio Prado de Mello said not only has the find yielded a large quantity of objects, many are in remarkably good condition.

He told website Journal Review Online: 'What is the most 
impressive is the intact state of many objects.

'In 
archaeology we usually find very fragmented pieces, but this time we're 
finding whole objects.'

The
ivory toothbrush is one of the more coveted items as it is belonged to Dom Pedro II, who ruled 
over Brazil between 1831 and 1889.

Chemist: The toothpaste porcelain pots were made by a firm with branches in London and Paris

Bottles: Thousands of glass and ceramic bottles and containers have been recovered from the site

Intact: While these spittoons may be cracked and broken, many of the items are in excellent condition

Inscribed: The writing on this glass water bottle offers proof it was used by the Royal household

The ivory brush has turned brown with age and its boar bristles have all but disappeared.

But there is no doubt that it once polished the Royal's teeth given its inscription: 'His Majesty the 
Emperor of Brazil.'

A round white porcelain container inscribed with the words 'to the 
Queen of Portugal Maria of Saboia'  may have once contained mint-flavoured toothpaste, according to the team.

The chemist that made it had offices in London and Paris.

Dozens of glass and ceramic bottles have been found at the site, along with six sealed bottles that still contain unidentified liquids.

These are destined for the laboratory, where scientists will try to reveal what they are.

And dozens of 
coins and pipes were also found, along with a golden ring and a tie 
tack.

The excavation site has now been covered over while work continues to build the metro extension in time for the Olympic Games in 2016.

But once it is finished, the team will be back to continue their work that could shed new light on the life of the nation's last and arguably best-loved rulers.
