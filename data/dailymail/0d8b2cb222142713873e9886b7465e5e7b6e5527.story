Novak Djokovic is loving life right now and who could blame him? Not only is the Serbian this year's Wimbledon champion, he is also a newly married man and an expectant father.

The world No 1 triumphed on the lawns at SW19 earlier this month for the second time in his career, and promptly disappeared from public view to get married to his long-tim partner, Jelena Ristic.

The seven-time grand slam champion returned to the limelight on Tuesday by sharing a picture of himself with his new bride's arm draped around his shoulder.

'Mrs Djokovic and myself are sending you one big #hug from Belgrade,' he wrote on his Facebook page. 'Thank you all for beautiful wishes! Last couple of weeks were the best weeks of our lives and now with new energy we are turning to new challenges!'

Djokovic, 27, beat Roger Federer in a thrilling Wimbledon final to rise back to the summit of men's tennis. He then married his childhood sweetheart in Montenegro last Thursday.

Djokovic is expected to return to the competitive court for the Canadian Open in Toronto. 

After his break, Djokovic will turn his attentions to the next major on the calendar, the US Open, which is held in New York, starting on August 25.
