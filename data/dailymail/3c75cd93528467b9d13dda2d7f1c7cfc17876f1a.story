As viewers await the return of the Grantham family and Co tonight, true Downton Abbey fans can book their nuptials in a very special location.

Surrey County Council now has a licence to conduct weddings in the Victorian courtroom which was used to film the trial of Lord Grantham's valet, Mr John Bates (played by Brendan Coyle).

The ornate and elegant room, which is inside the local authority's Kingston-upon-Thames headquarters, was the setting for the tense scenes, which took part in series two of the show, filmed in 2011.

Order! Surrey County Council now has a licence to conduct weddings in the Victorian courtroom 

The courtroom was used in the trail of John Bates, played by Brendan Coyle (pictured right). Hugh Bonneville stars in the show as Robert Crawley, Earl of Grantham

The period drama's fifth series begins on Sunday night and die-hard fans will be pleased 

Denise Le Gal, Surrey County Council's Cabinet Member for Business Services, said: 'I wouldn't be surprised if the more avid Downton fans decide to exchange vows in the same courtroom that witnessed Mr Bates's trial.

'But if a Downton-themed ceremony isn't a particular couple's cup of tea they could always pick one of the other hit shows we have hosted in County Hall. 

'Maybe Lewis, Endeavour or Midsomer Murders for detective drama lovers, or even The Bill for any police officers walking down the aisle!'

Season five of the popular period drama begins on Sunday, with characters such as Lady Mary (played by Michelle Dockery) and Tom Branson (played by Allen Leech) returning to our screens

A day's exclusive use of the courtroom for the ceremony and one of the other grand chambers for the reception is between £3,000-£3,250

TV shows shot at the courtroom and other parts of County Hall since 2006 include: Poirot, EastEnders, The Bill, Holby City, Silk, Silent Witness, Foyle's War, Midsomer Murders, Lewis, Endeavour, Call The Midwife and Birds of a Feather.
