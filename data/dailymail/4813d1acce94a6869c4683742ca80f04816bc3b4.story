It provided the 'perfick' setting for the small-screen escapades of Ma and Pop Larkin and their boisterous family in a series enjoyed by millions of devoted viewers in the early 1990s.

Now the stunning Kent farmhouse used as the backdrop for the hit TV show The Darling Buds Of May - which starred Catherine Zeta-Jones in the role that helped launch her stellar career - has gone on sale for £1.35million.

Grade II listed Buss Farm, which has been owned by the Holmes family for the past 40 years, is set in 20 acres and boasts a Tudor barn and an oast house for drying hops.

Roger Holmes, 59, who first shared Buss Farm with his late parents Raymond and Gladys, lives alone at the home in Bethersden.

Mr Holmes said he had many wonderful memories of the programme being filmed at his home.

He
also told how he even struck up a friendship with lead actor David 
Jason - who played Sidney Charles 'Pop' Larkin (renowned for his 
'perfick' catchphrase) - when the pair bonded over a shared interest in 
mechanics.

'I was restoring a classic car and he was restoring motorbikes,' Mr Holmes said.

'The
filming went on for three years and each time David came he would see 
how I was progressing and say I had not done much, or I was getting on 
well.

'The production crew 
wanted us to move out while they were filming, but we said no way - we 
didn’t want to miss all the fun,' added Mr Holmes, who is the director 
of a computer program company.

The
Darling Buds Of May, which also starred Pam Ferris as Ma Larkin, was 
based on the novels by H.E. Bates and aired from 1990 to 1993.

It detailed the lives and loves of the Larkin family in the 1950s.

Recalling
the day the film crew from Yorkshire TV came to view the house, Mr 
Holmes said: 'My mother was just going out when they turned up and asked
if they could take some pictures.

'She said go ahead, then they came back and said they wanted to bring the producer and started talking about locations.

'They talked about coming here for a few weeks and about David Jason, so we got more interested.

'When they began shooting, we thought it was just for a little series. We never dreamt it would be so big.'

Despite the disruption of shooting that sometimes went on all night at his home, Mr Holmes said it was 'a glorious time'.

'We got to know the cast fairly well. Pam Ferris was lovely to talk to,' he said.

'The series really launched Catherine Zeta-Jones’ career.

'I spoke to her a few times but she was always surrounded by men.'

Since filming ended in 1992, Buss Farm has hosted the annual Darling Buds of May Classic Car Show.

Mr Holmes admitted leaving his home would be a wrench: 'Forty years is a long time,' he said.

As well as the farmyard the house comes with a large front garden
