The Queen has reportedly agreed to allow the charity of her former daughter-in-law, the Duchess of York, hold a party at Windsor Castle.

Sarah Ferguson, the former wife of Prince Andrew, will be a key figure at the £50,000 party for 200 guests at Windsor's State Apartments on Wednesday, held to mark the 21st anniversary of her charity Children In Crisis

The move marks a return to the fold for Fergie, after brushes with scandal left her reportedly ostracised by senior members of the royal family - in particular, Prince Philip, who has not spoken to her for years.

The Queen has reportedly agreed to allow the charity of her former daughter-in-law, the Duchess of York, hold a party at Windsor Castle 

A source told the Sunday Express that the Duchess of York was 'over the moon' that the Queen had allowed her to hold the party at Windsor.

But reports that the Duke of York is throwing a 55th birthday party for his ex-wife,are 'totally incorrect', it was claimed today.

A spokesman for the Duchess told Mail Online that while a dinner is being held at the royal residence on Wednesday, it is to mark the 21st anniversary of her charity Children In Crisis and no mention of her birthday is being made.

James Henderson, who is also a trustee of the charity, said: 'There is an event being held on Wednesday night at Windsor Castle, but it is to mark the 21st anniversary of the Duchess's charity Children In Crisis.

'More than 200 receptions are held at the castle each year and this is one of them.

'It is being thrown by the Duke of York in honour of the milestone and the work his ex-wife and their children do for the charity.

'The invitations went out in the Duke's name and very much bore the charity's logo. There is no mention or acknowledgement of the Duchess of York's birthday and nor does she want there to be. This is all about this remarkable charity. The fact that it is her birthday is just a coincidence.

'Some two hundred people will attend the dinner, all of whom are supporters of Children in Crisis.'

A source close to the Duchess also quashed suggestions that Prince Harry would be there but said it was more than likely that his on-off girlfriend, Cressida Bonas, would be as she is Princess Eugenie's best friend and is very close to the Duchess.

She also attended a Children In Crisis event thrown by the princess over the summer.

Sir Elton John and partner David Furnish have also been invited alongside Virgin boss Sir Richard Branson and children Sam and Holly.

Kate Moss and fellow supermodel Naomi Campbell are also said to have received an invite as well as Formula One boss Bernie Ecclestone. 

Downton Abbey creator Lord Julian Fellowes, and Stephen Fry are also expected to attend. 

While the Queen has long been said to have remained fond of her former daughter-in-law, Prince Philip is said to be baffled by Fergie and Prince Andrew's relationship. 

The couple, who still live together, separated in 1992 but remained on good terms and brought up their daughters together.

It has been claimed that Prince Philip has never forgiven the Duchess for the embarrassment she caused the Royal Family during the 90s - during which time she embarked on an affair with a Texan oil tycoon while pregnant with her second child and was photographed ­having her toes sucked by her 'financial adviser'.

In 2010 she also was revealed to have tried to sell access to Andrew for £500,000 to an undercover reporter as she tried desperately to pay off debts of £3million.

It has been reported that Prince Andrew, then a Special Trade Ambassador, helped her out of financial difficulty.

Fergie has been living in the Queen mother's old home, the Royal Lodge, for five years.

In 2000 Fergie said during an interview that she and her former husband had talked of remarrying but that Prince Philip would not allow it.

The Queen is said to think of her as a 'good mother'.
