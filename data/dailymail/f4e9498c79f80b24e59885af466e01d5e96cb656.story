Say goodbye to your old, boring, regular oven. The age of the smart oven could soon be upon us.

And the latest attempt at bringing internet connectivity to this mainstay of the kitchen is Maid (Make All Incredible Dishes).

This smart oven can provide you with recipes on what to cook, speaks aloud the instructions and also provides accurate timings each step of the way.

California company SectorQube has designed a smart oven for kitchens. Called Maid (Make All Incredible Dishes), pictured, it displays recipes and reads them. Users can select a recipe using a touch screen on the oven. It will then select the time and temperature needed for the food

Maid is currently on Kickstarter, where it reached its goal of £31,000 ($50,000) in just five days.

It’s only a prototype for now but it already has a number of potential features.

For starters, it uses a recipe store to provide a wide range of dishes for you to select.

Microwave output (watts): 900

Top-heater output: 1,200

Convection heater: 1,750

Volume: 1.2 cubic feet (0.03 cubic metres)

Screen: 6-inch capacitive

Connectivity: Wi-Fi

Dimensions: 16.1 x 19.7 x 20.7 inches (409 x 501 x 526 mm) 

The oven has a touch screen on which selections and navigation can be done which is called Maid Assist.

Users can also upload their own dishes and step-by-step guides.

When a user selects a recipe, which can be searched for from a list, the oven reads aloud each step.

The time and temperature required is also shown on the screen, and the oven can adapt the numbers depending on the number of servings needed.

If all this automatic control isn’t for you, there’s also the option to do everything manually.

As for the oven itself it is a convention, microwave and top-heater oven in one.

There are also plans to release a Maid App that syncs with the oven, letting you talk to it and make gestures to use its various features.

Maid will retail for about £280 ($449), and the company expects to start shipping in November 2015.

Maid will cost £280 ($449) and will be released in November 2015. The oven has a touch screen on which selections and navigation can be done which is called Maid Assist. Users can also upload their own dishes and step-by-step guides. When a user selects a recipe the oven reads aloud each step
