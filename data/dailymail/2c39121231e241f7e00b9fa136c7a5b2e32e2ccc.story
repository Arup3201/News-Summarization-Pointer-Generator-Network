A leading member of the Ferguson protest movement has made an impassioned plea to the Grand Jury deciding whether to indict the white officer who shot dead a black teenager.

Larry Fellows III said that his message to the panel is: 'A mother has lost her son and it is not of his own doing.

'For people to continually to say it's his fault for his death is just disgusting.

'You have in your hands the decision to put someone away who has murdered a young man.'

In an interview with MailOnline, Fellows also revealed that the protesters feared that the police response to unrest when the Grand Jury make their decision could be '10 times worse' than before - because they had been preparing for so long.

Fellows, 29, has become a leading voice in the protest movement and has built up 5,000 followers on his Twitter account  through his work with the organizers.

They began work right after Michael Brown, 18, was shot dead by Darren Wilson, 28, a white police officer with the force in Ferguson, a suburb of St Louis in Missouri, on August 9.

The killing sparked several nights of violent protest which was met with a military style response that sparked a debate about the use of force by police and race relations in America.

Since then protesters have been working under coalitions such as Hands Up United and in October staged a 'Weekend of Resistance'.

They have also made extensive use of social media, appeared on major TV networks, set up training sessions for protesters and have won pledges of support from around the world.

With the Grand Jury decision expected in the coming days, Missouri governor Jay Nixon has declared a state of emergency in St Louis and the surrounding counties with 400 troops expected to be deployed in the downtown area of the city.

Fellows said: 'With governor Nixon declaring a state of emergency for St Louis that's basically just the unwritten rule that whatever the police feel, if they feel threatened or feel the need to act in a certain way, they have the freedom to do so.

'So it's no-holds barred on our constitutional rules and our rights as citizens. That's out the door for now.

'Going into that mentally, we can prepare as much as we think we can but what are we preparing for? With us going through August, we think it's going to be 10 times worse. It's so hilarious for me how people focus and violence and it's coming from police, not protesters.'

Fellows told MailOnline that an indictment was the 'only way' the Grand Jury, which has nine white members and three black, should vote.

He said: 'They have that power to decide should he be reprimanded...It's not fair'

Flashpoint: Ferguson is expecting more demonstrations when the grand jury ends it deliberations

Tensions: Demonstrations are already taking place in Ferguson, Missouri, with calls for Darren Wilson to be indicted by the grand jury, which meets again on Friday, over the killing of Michael Brown

Divide: Although most demonstrations have been pro-Michael Brown some, such as this woman's protest, have been in support of Darren Wilson, the officer who shot Brown to death

Fellows said that he has heard many rumors about Wilson: that he went to a St Louis Blues ice hockey game, that he had dyed his hair and that he had changed his name.

Some people were even joking that he was in Sri Lanka or the Bahamas.

Fellows said: 'I think he's in St Louis. Look how much money people have raised for him. He doesn't have to leave.

'Nobody's protected Mike's (Brown) family. I couldn't be in the same room as him (Wilson). I'm not even an angry person or a violent person. I can't sit and look at you in the face.

'If you are a human being, you have a heart and you have any common sense, turn yourself in.

'Why are you letting it go on like this? I have no respect for him. It's as simple as that. Go to the Feds and turn yourself in'

It has now been three months since Brown was shot dead and the protesters are 'exhausted', Fellows said.

He had been working as a biller for a healthcare company but lost his job as he found it impossible to juggle employment and protesting.

Fellows said that he cannot pay his bills and that the rent on his apartment was overdue - and others like him are in the same boat.

He said: 'It's definitely a huge sacrifice. I have a lot of friends who have kids and they can't come out (and protest) for that very reason.

'That's why I'm doing this, so that their kids can walk out on the street and not be approached by a cop asking them where they're going.

'That's why I'm doing this.'

Fellows told MailOnline that he was 'skeptical' about the Ferguson Commission which was announced on Tuesday by Missouri governor Jay Nixon to look into the causes of the divisions in the city.

However he said had 'absolute faith' in four members who he knew personally, including the youngest, 20-year-old Rasheen Lamont Aldridge.

EXCLUSIVE: Pro-Darren Wilson demonstrators face claims of KKK infiltration after 'imperial wizard' apparently spotted by anti-police demonstrators

Klu Klux Klan members may have infiltrated groups supporting Ferguson police officer Darren Wilson, it can be disclosed.

Supporters for Darren Wilson have removed a photograph from their Facebook page in which activist group Anonymous claim to identify three members of the Ku Klux Klan.

Anonymous seized two of the Ku Klux Klan's twitter accounts yesterday after the Klan distributed fliers threatening the use of 'lethal force' should violence erupt in the wake of Ferguson Grand Jury's decision on whether to indict Wilson.

Now, as part of Anon Cop Watch, the group has circulated numerous photographs 'unhooding' Klan members.

Among them is one showing 13 members of the St Louis Klan. It is set shown alongside an image of a rally held in support of Darren Wilson rally in which, they claim, three Klan members feature prominently.

One of them appears to be Frank Ancona, Imperial Wizard of the Traditionalist American Knights of the Ku Klux Klan in Missouri and the man behind the recent fliers.

It is just the latest escalation of the racial tensions that were ignited this summer when officer Wilson shot dead unarmed teenager Michael Brown, 18.

Protesters adopted the slogan 'Hands Up Don't Shoot' - a reference to witness accounts claiming that Brown had his hands up when Wilson let off his fatal volley on August 9.

Less than two minutes elapsed between Wilson, 28, stopping Brown and friend, Dorian Johnson, as they walked down the middle of Canfield Road which snakes down from the main drag of West Florissant, and shooting Brown dead.

In the three months since that day Ferguson has been riven by violence, protest, gunfire and looting.

Brown's own parents have consistently distanced themselves from the violence that saw protesters and police clash as battle lines were drawn near the scene of the shooting across night after night of riots.

But, with the Ferguson Grand Jury expected to deliver its verdict on whether or not to indict Wilson on a murder charge this week, the FBI have described violent civil unrest as 'inevitable.'

Governor Jay Nixon's decision to declare a State of Emergency and activated the National Guard on Monday was seen by many as confirmation that a decision from the Grand Jury is imminent. And prosecutor Bob McCulloch has always maintained that a verdict would be reached by mid to late November.

But leaks reported by the St Louis Dispatch, which suggest that the officer will not be indicted, have only heightened the likelihood of violent reprisal.

As MailOnline reported, 'militant resistance group' the Black Rebels has boasted of being 'war ready,' and stockpiling high caliber ammunition. While the Ku Klux Klan leaflets distributed in Ferguson and the surrounding towns suggest a similar readiness for violence.
