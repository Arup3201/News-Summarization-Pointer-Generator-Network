Brendan Rodgers has made it his ambition to give Steven Gerrard the perfect send-off — and birthday present — by leading Liverpool to FA Cup glory.

Liverpool’s captain will move to America, to either LA Galaxy or New York Red Bulls, once his contract expires at the end of this season and, as it stands, his last game is scheduled to be against Stoke City in the Barclays Premier League at the Britannia Stadium on May 24.

The FA Cup final, however, is staged on May 30 this year — the day Gerrard turns 35 — and Rodgers believes there could be no better way for his captain to end his lifelong association with Liverpool than by walking around Wembley clutching one of the game’s biggest prizes.

Steven Gerrard could end his Liverpool career by winning the FA Cup on May 30 - should Brendan Rodgers' side make it to the final.

He has twice won the FA Cup before in 2001 and 2006 and lost another final in 2012.  

Gerrard is expected to start Monday's third-round clash against League Two side AFC Wimbledon, with Rodgers showing how seriously he is taking the competition by naming a strong side. He certainly does not want this to be the last time Gerrard plays in the FA Cup.

‘Our aim was always to win a trophy this year and even more so now with that added incentive,’ said Rodgers. ‘To have a captain who has been a monumental figure for this club leaving there’d be no greater tribute than to reach a final, particularly an FA Cup final.

‘To see him lift a trophy, that is what dreams are all about. It would be a great way for him to end his career and certainly we don’t want Stoke City to be our last game of the season.’

It has been an emotional time for Gerrard and the strain he has been under was illustrated during a 13-minute interview with Liverpool’s television station that was aired on Saturday evening; there were a couple of occasions when he had to pause to compose himself.

Gerrard revealed he had a chat with Brendan Rodgers about his future at the club before deciding to leave

Gerrard took the decision to leave after Rodgers explained to him his amount of playing time would be ‘managed’ next season, the midfielder admitting he would find it hard to accept being a squad player, given he has been a fixture in the team throughout his career.

‘I’m bright enough to realise that it is the right thing for everyone,’ said Gerrard.

Rodgers is now looking at others to step into the leadership role at the club. Jordan Henderson will almost certainly become club captain when Gerrard hands over the armband — ‘It was one of the reasons I made him vice-captain,’ according to Rodgers — and there are others, such as Raheem Sterling, in whom the manager sees potential .

Sterling is edging closer to signing a new long-term contract, and Rodgers added: ‘Hopefully they can become that type of leader and character that makes up successful teams.’
