The arrest of a US diplomat accused of being a CIA spy was linked to the Boston bombing, sources revealed today.

Russian security officials reported on Tuesday that they had briefly detained Ryan Fogle in Moscow for allegedly trying to recruit a Russian intelligence officer.

Today sources revealed the man Mr Fogle 
was trying to ‘recruit’ was an FSB agent who specialised in Islamic 
extremism in Russia and may even have travelled to the region where the 
bombing suspects came from.

Lure: Sources today said that Ryan Fogle, right, was seeking to lure into treachery an FSB agent who had knowledge of Russian intelligence operations on suspected Boston terrorist Tamerlan Tsarnaev,  left

It is thought that he was part of a 
team who went to Dagestan and provided intelligence to the United States
 about an extremist threat in 2011.

Fogle, a third secretary at the U.S. 
Embassy, who was carrying special technical equipment, disguises, 
written instructions and a large sum of money. Fogle was later handed 
over to U.S. Embassy officials.

This morning the Russian foreign 
ministry today issued a formal protest to American ambassador Michael 
McFaul who was summoned to explain the alleged espionage mission of one 
of his diplomats.

As he left after the brief session 
with Deputy Foreign Minister Sergei Ryabkov, the envoy waved to 
reporters but refused to comment.

Relations: U.S. Ambassador Michael McFaul walks outside as he leaves the Russian Foreign Ministry headquarters in Moscow. He was summoned to explain the alleged espionage mission of one of his diplomats

The Ministry hit out at 'provocative 
acts in the spirit of the Cold War' and has ordered the expulsion of 
Fogle, arrested wearing a blond wig under his baseball cap.

'This does not contribute to the 
further process of building mutual trust between Russia and the United 
States and bringing our relations to a qualitatively new level,' warned 
Dmitry Peskov, spokesman for Russian president Vladimir Putin.

But it was becoming clearer today 
that the US was seeking to lure into treachery an FSB agent who had 
knowledge of Russian intelligence operations on suspected Boston 
terrorist Tamerlan Tsarnaev, who lived in America but had travelled to 
Dagastan where he was believed to have met Islamic extremists.

Arrested: The US diplomat was pinned to the ground and arrested by the Russian agent he was trying to recruit

Claims: The FSB counter intelligence service said the envoy, a third secretary in the political section of the American embassy was caught red handed seeking to recruit a Russian intelligence officer

Detained: The FSB said Fogle was in possession of two floppy wigs, three pairs of glasses, a map of Moscow and a folding knife when he was detained

Seized: After his arrest, he was taken to the FSB headquarters at the Lubyanka, in Moscow, and later handed over to the US embassy in keeping with diplomatic protocols

The FSB had earlier warned the FBI about his potential extremist links.

In material released by the FSB, it 
is clear the Americans had phone numbers for one or more Russian 
intelligence agents involved in anti-terrorism work in the Caucasus.

They obtained these during trip involving FBI agents to Dagestan in search of intelligence on Tamerlan's trip.

'After the first call he refused to 
meet, but this man called again and insisted on a meeting,' said a 
recording of a FSB officer addressing three US diplomats who came to 
collect the alleged CIA agent from FSB headquarters.

'At first we did not believe it was 
happening, because recently the FSB has been actively helping to 
investigate the Boston blasts, and was also providing some other 
information about threats to US national security'.

Today Kommersant newspaper said: 'It
 is likely that during the trip in April the US side obtained the phone 
numbers of Federal Security Service (FSB) agents.'

'Clearly, they then decided to use it
 to have personal contacts with anti-terror agents, given that the 
exchange of information in the form of question and answers between 
special services is not always quick and smooth,' it said.

Russia has not named the target of 
the US co-operation, and it is not known whether the agent has faced any
 problems or even arrest over the US interest in him.

Fogle apparently hinted at an initial
 payment of $100,000 followed up a salary of up to $1 million a year 
plus bonuses if the Russian intelligence official handed over secrets to
 the CIA.

Russian Foreign Minister Sergei 
Lavrov said he had opted not to bring up the case at talks with US 
Secretary of State John Kerry on Tuesday in Sweden.

'I decided that talking about it would
 be superfluous, since it is already made public and everyone already 
understands everything,' he said.

Statement: 'Recently, the US intelligence service has made repeated attempts to recruit the staff of Russian law enforcement agencies and special services,' according to the FSB

Stash: He was detained with 'special technical devices, written instructions for the person he was recruiting, a lot of cash, and things to help  change one's appearance,' according to the FSB

Mission: The website of the American embassy in Russia informs that its Political Section is engaged in 'bringing to the attention of the Russian government the US position on the issues of foreign policy and security'

Questions: A letter the agent carried suggested the US government was willing to pay up to $1 million a year plus bonuses to his unidentified potential Russian recruit, if the letter released by the FSB is genuine

Release: Fogle was held overnight before being released to U.S. officials and expelled from Russia

Fogle was the first American diplomat to be publicly accused of spying in Russia in about a decade.

While relations between the two countries have been strained, officials in both Washington and Moscow sought to play down the incident.

Fogle was caught in Vorontsovski Park, an area in south-east Moscow, the FSB said.

A letter in Russian which Fogle 
carried suggests – if genuine – that the CIA hoped to reel in a big 
fish.

Addressed ‘Dear friend’, it states: ‘We are ready to offer you 
$100,000 [£65,000] and discuss your experience, expertise and 
co-operation, and the payment may go much higher if you are ready to 
answer certain questions.

‘For long-term co-operation we offer $1million [£650,000] per year.’

The recruit is instructed to use an 
internet cafe to ‘create a new Gmail mailbox which you will use only for
 staying in touch with us’.

The incident is the biggest spy 
scandal since the arrest of glamorous agent Anna Chapman and nine other 
Russians in the US in 2010.

The FSB stated: ‘Recently, the US 
intelligence community has made repeated attempts to recruit employees 
of Russia’s law-enforcement bodies and special agencies.’

Many details remained shrouded in 
mystery last night. It is not known whether the target was part of the 
sting operation or if they have been arrested.

Russia’s haste to make the news public
 could mean either that the attempt was so audacious that it shocked 
leaders, or that hardliners have seized on it to stop a move towards 
detente with the US.

Yesterday Patty Fogle, the diplomat’s mother, refused to comment at her home in St Louis, Missouri.
