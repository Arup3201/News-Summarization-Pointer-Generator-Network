Rio Ferdinand has been the bedrock of Manchester United's defence for 12 seasons in a trophy-laden period at Old Trafford.

The 35-year-old's honours include six Premier League titles, a Champions League, a Club World Cup and two League Cups, but despite all that he was told by United chief Ed Woodward on Sunday that he has no future at Old Trafford, making the 1-1 draw at Southampton his 455th and final match for the club.

Here, Sportsmail looks back on Ferdinand's career in the red half of Manchester...

The early days: Rio Ferdinand won his first Premier League title with Manchester United in 2002/03 (left)

Ferdinand joined United in July 2002 
for £29.1million from Leeds - in what was the most expensive transfer 
for an English player at the time.

The defender got off to a dream debut season at the club making 28 league appearances as United won the 2002-03 Premier League title - finishing five points clear of second-placed Arsenal.

The following season was met with controversy as Ferdinand was slapped with an eight-month ban by the FA in January 2004 after missing a drugs test.

The sanction resulted in the England centre half missing the rest of the season and Euro 2004. 

Lean patch: Ferdinand finished third with United during the 2004/05 and 2005/06 seasons

After his ban, Ferdinand was a virtual 
ever-present in the United defence as he played 31 times in the league 
for the club as they finished third behind Jose Mourinho's Chelsea.

They also finished third in
 2005-06 but it was better on a personal level  forFerdinand as he agreed a
 new four-year deal and also scored his first goal for the club in 
December 2005 against Wigan.

United also beat Wigan 4-0 in the League Cup final at the Millennium Stadium to win their first piece of 
silverware in three years.

The stats: Ferdinand featured in 312 Premier League matches for United, winning six domestic titles

Double joy: Ferdinand was a virtual ever present as United won back-to-back league titles in 2007 and 2008

The
 2006-07 and 2007-08 seasons were arguably Ferdinand's greatest in a 
United shirt. Having formed a formidable partnership with Nemanja Vidic -
 the duo provided the backbone for back-to-back Premier League 
title successes.

In the former campaign, Ferdinand made 33 league 
appearances and 35 in the latter - chipping in with three goals and one
 assist. 

The
 2007-08 season was extra special for the defender as he made 11 
appearances for Sir Alex Ferguson's side en route to winning the 
Champions League final against Chelsea in Moscow.

Three and easy: Ferdinand won his third successive Premier League title with United in 2008-09 (left)

United
 again proved they were the team to beat in 2008-09 as they won a third 
consecutive Premier League title - however, limited the England 
star to only 24 appearances.

As defending champions of Europe's elite 
competition, the defender again featured 11 times as the club lost 2-0 
in the showpiece to Barcelona in Rome.

Back
 injuries started to plague Ferdinand towards the end of his career and 
this showed as he only made 13 league appearances the following season 
as United lost the Premier League to Chelsea.

Injury years: Back problems limited Ferdinand to less than 20 league games per season in 2009-10 and 2010-11

Things
 were to improve for Ferdinand though, as he made 19 appearances as the club 
successfully regained their crown and eclipsed Liverpool's record of 18 
league titles.

During the 
2011-12 season, the centre back played 30 times as United 
dramatically lost the Premier League on the final day of the season to 
their 'noisy neighbours' Manchester City.

Last hurrah: Ferdinand won his final and sixth Premier League title in 2012-13 (left)

United
 responded in emphatic fashion the following campaign, storming their way 
to a 20th English crown by 11 points from their city rivals. In what 
proved to be legendary boss Ferguson's last season, Ferdinand made 28 league appearances, scoring his final 
goal for the club in a 2-1 win against Swansea in May 2013.

Ferdinand's
 final season at United was a frustrating one for the 35-year-old. 
Marginalised by Ferguson's successor David Moyes, he only featured 14 
times for the side in the league - with his last coming in the 1-1 draw 
at Southampton on Sunday.

European scale: Ferdinand 86 played Champions League games for United, winning the competition in 2008
