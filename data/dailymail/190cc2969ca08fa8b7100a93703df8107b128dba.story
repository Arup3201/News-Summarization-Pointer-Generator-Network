Lord Justice Leveson is facing a standoff with MPs after being summoned to give evidence to a Commons committee on the future of Press regulation.

The judge, who led last year’s inquiry into media standards, was yesterday called to appear before the culture, media and sport committee.

He refused to answer questions on the day his report was published and is understood to have indicated that he has no desire to appear before MPs, arguing that judges do not have to explain themselves to Parliament.

Discussions between Parliament and the Lord Chief Justice, which started some months ago, are thought to have ended in stalemate.

But yesterday members of the committee agreed at a private meeting to ask Lord Justice Leveson to appear before them.

They want him to face questions – expected to include the issue of why wider evidence of phone hacking and surveillance by law and insurance firms was not highlighted in his report – before the Commons begins its summer break on July 18.

John Whittingdale, the committee’s chairman, said: ‘We would like to hear his views on the developments that have taken place since the publication of the report. We would like to hear his view of what is on the table.

‘He chaired an inquiry which made recommendations to Parliament – it doesn’t seem unreasonable that Parliament ask him some questions about that. If he were a sitting judge delivering a verdict on a case, that would be different. That wasn’t the case in this instance.’

If he agrees to appear, Lord Justice Leveson will be questioned on the two rival versions of a Royal Charter that would underpin a new media regulator – one produced after cross-party talks, and the other by the newspaper industry.

Lord Justice Leveson is also likely to be questioned about the affair between Carine Patry Hoskins, a lawyer to his inquiry, and David Sherborne, a barrister representing celebrities complaining about the Press

Both are being considered by the Privy Council, an advisory body to the Queen which issues such charters.

Lord Justice Leveson is also likely to be questioned about the revelation that a lawyer to his inquiry had an affair with a barrister representing celebrities complaining about the Press. Carine Patry Hoskins, a married mother of two, started a relationship with David Sherborne, a barrister representing advocates of statutory Press regulation.

The invitation to Lord Justice Leveson is believed to be the first time a judge has been publicly summoned to a Commons select committee.

However Lord Hutton, who led  an inquiry into the death of government scientist Dr David Kelly, gave evidence to the public administration select committee after he had retired as a judge.

Appearances by judges before MPs are usually choreographed, with  questioning limited to matters that  do not draw judges into individual cases, criticism of public figures or political controversy.

The rules that govern judicial select committee appearances state that  it is ‘extremely unusual and very unlikely to be the case that a parliamentary committee will order a judge to attend’.

Asked whether the judge should appear before the committee, David Cameron’s official spokesman said: ‘It is a matter for him.’

A spokesman for the judiciary said: ‘Lord Justice Leveson has not received any communication from the committee. He will respond if and when he does.’
