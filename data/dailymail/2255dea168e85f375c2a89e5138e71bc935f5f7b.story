The chief executive and leading researcher of biotechnology company Phosphagenics conned millions of dollars from her employer over nine years to fund her lifestyle and support her sick daughter.

Dr Esra Ogru, 39, of Wheelers Hill, Victoria, was part of a scam which saw $6 million embezzled from the world renowned biotech company between 2004 and 2013. 

Dr Ogru swindled Phosphagenics and its subsidiary Vital Health Sciences using fake invoices and credit card claims, the Victorian County Court heard on Thursday.

Prosecutor Allan Sharp said about $3.8 million had already been reimbursed and about $5.2 million was expected to be recouped.

The CEO kept her crime secret from her co-chief executive, and pleaded guilty to seven counts of obtaining a financial advantage by deception.  

David Grace QC, lawyer for Dr Ogru, said that a large proportion of the stolen money was used for lifestyle enhancement. 

Dr Ogru allegedly used the sum for purchasing jewellery, travel, and mortgage repayments, Mr Grace told the Victorian court.

'In some way she felt ... she deserved more in terms of remuneration and wanted a better lifestyle in a hurry,' he said.

In May 2008, Dr Ogru gave birth to her daughter, who had a life-long condition which resulted from a missing gene. 

Mr Grace said that  this changed Dr Ogru's motivations for embezzling the money, and she began using it to pay for world-class health care for the girl.

Grace told the court that Dr Ogru's daughter became the first human in the world to trial an experimental therapy in Germany, which had previously been used on animals

Mr Grace asked the court to take into consideration the exceptional circumstances during sentencing.

The funds went towards renovations of the family home to accommodate for the girl's special needs, including a wheelchair.

'Prior (to May 2008) can be characterised as greed, (but) post, greed and need,' Mr Grace said.

Mr Grace told the court that Dr Ogru's daughter became the first human in the world to trial an experimental therapy in Germany, which had previously been used on animals.

The therapy had to be administered daily, adding that the treatment had led to the drug becoming an accepted prescription medicine around the world.

The company suspended Dr Ogru in July 2013 after irregularities in financial records came to light, reported the Sydney Morning Herald. 

Her lawyer admitted that had her co-executive known of her daughter's medical problems, she would have most likely received legal help.

Judge Felicity Hampel extended her bail until sentencing on November 5.
