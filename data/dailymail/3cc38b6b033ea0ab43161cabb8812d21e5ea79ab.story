Rudolph Hess, Hitler's Deputy, offered peace for Western Europe - in exchange for a clear path to attack the Soviets

The Nazis attempted to broker a peace offering with Britain - if they were allowed a free path to attack the USSR, a new book has revealed.

Rudolf Hess's flight to Britain during World War Two to sign a peace deal ordered by Adolf Hitler has long been recorded as a bizarre one man mission to try and reconcile warring West Europe and the Nazis.

But the high-ranking Nazi was actually carrying out orders from the Fuhrer when he flew to Messerschmitt to Scotland in May 1941.

He was to offer the British government a deal that would see Germany pull out of Western Europe - so long as the fascists could attack the USSR without intervention.

But historian Peter Padfield has discovered evidence he claims proves that the deputy Fuhrer held a detailed peace treaty.

It proposed that the Nazis would withdraw from western Europe, in exchange for British neutrality over a planned attack on Russia, the Daily Telegraph reported.

The researcher claims in a new book that a German-speaking unnamed informant told him he was called in to translate the documents that showed Germany wanted a clear path to attack the Soviets within five weeks.

Hess' mission began with him parachuting out over Renfrewshire where he was arrested by a farmhand with a pitchfork.

The Third Reich deputy wanted to contact the Duke of Hamilton to set peace talks with Winston Churchill in motion.

But despite the offer, Churchill's morals were not swayed by the offer.

He refused to allow the Third Reich a clear path to attack the Eastern Front - because he did not trust Hitler's promises and it would have jeopardised his efforts to involve the U.S in the raging war, Mr Padfield says.

The author claims the Prime Minister was determined to beat Hitler and he did not want to destroy a coalition of European governments, so the offer was not made public.

Mr Padfield, who makes the claims in a new book, Hess, Hitler and Churchill, said: 'This was not a renegade plot.

'Hitler had sent Hess and he brought over a fully developed peace treaty for Germany to evacuate all the occupied countries in the West.'

Hess survived the war and was tried at Nuremberg for war crimes.

He was sentenced to life imprisonment and spent more time behind bars than any other Third Reich leaders before taking his own life in Spandau Prison near Berlin in 1987, aged 93.

At Nuremberg Hess appeared to be the delusional, forgetful, mentally ill figure that Hitler claimed he was after the abortive mission.

It was an act recorded as a one-man mad mission.

Hess was, apparently, trying to set peace talks with Winston Churchill in motion under his own initiative.

Hitler was even supposed to have scrambled aircraft to try to stop Hess, his deputy, from leaving Germany.

But a 28-page notebook discovered in a Russian archive in 2011 disputes this theory and indicates that Hitler was in on the mission.

It was written in 1948 by Major Karlheinz Pintsch, a long-time adjutant to Hess.

He was captured by the Soviets and spent years undergoing  torture and interrogation at  their hands.

In the notebook he writes that Hitler hoped that an ‘agreement with the Englishmen would be successful’.

Pintsch notes that Hess’s task – five weeks before Germany launched its invasion of Russia – was to ‘bring about, if not a military alliance of Germany with England against Russia, then to bring about a neutralisation of England’.

Pintsch’s interrogation transcripts found in the same archive in Moscow show that Hitler was not surprised when news came through of Hess’s capture.

The relevant section reads: 'Nor did he rant and rave about what Hess had done.

Instead, he replied calmly: 'At this particular moment in the war that could be a most hazardous escapade.'

'Hitler then went on to read a letter that Hess had sent him.

'He read the following significant passage out aloud: "And if this project . . . ends in failure . . . it will always be possible for you to deny all responsibility. Simply say I was out of my mind".'

This is what would happen after the mission failed, with both Hitler and Churchill claiming Hess was deranged.
