Error: More than 100 people are reported to have complained about text messages telling them they are in Britain illegally

Tens of thousands of illegal immigrants have been sent text messages encouraging them to leave the country.

Technical support company Capita dispatched nearly 40,000 to suspected visa over-stayers as part of a Home Office campaign.

The text reads: ‘Message from the Home Office. Our records show that you may not have leave to remain in the UK. Please  contact us on 0844 3754636 to  discuss your case.’

Capita is being paid to send the messages as well as letters to some 60,000 foreign nationals who may still be in Britain despite their visas expiring.

However, the Home Office faces fresh criticism for its tactics to tackle illegal immigration after more than 100 people complained about being sent text messages saying they had no right to stay in Britain.

It has emerged those to receive the messages include a civil rights campaigner who has been in Britain since 1966 and an immigration caseworker.

It comes as Home Office minister Mark Harper signalled that controversial vans telling people to 'go home' could be used again despite opposition from the Lib Dems.

London Mayor Boris Johnson also backed the vans, claiming they could be useful in persuading people to leave Britain.

In the text campaign, the standard message from private contractor Capita states: ‘Message from the UK Border Agency: You are required to leave the UK as you no longer have the right to remain.’

They were first sent out last Christmas holidays and the company also uses phone, email or letter to warn people that UK Border Agency records suggest they need to leave the country.

Earlier this year the Information Commissioner launched an investigation into the bizarre tactic, amid complaints that UKBA held inaccurate and outdated data, in breach of the Data Protection Act.

Now a government source has told the Independent that ‘mistakes have clearly been made’ ABOUT who has been targeted, triggering more than 100 complaints.

One, Suresh Grover, is a civil rights campaigner and founded the anti-racism charity The Monitoring Group which has campaigned for justice for Stephen Lawrence and Victoria Climbie.

He told the newspaper: ‘I was absolutely shocked and quite horrified to receive the text. I thought it wasn’t meant for me.

‘I came here with my parents in 1966, I was born in East Africa and have always had a British passport.’

Controversy: The Home Office has also faced criticism for the use of billboard vans telling illegal immigrants to 'go home'

Bobby Chan, an accredited immigration adviser at a central London law firm, also received the message.

Mr Chan said: ‘I came here in 1973 so I was very surprised to receive this message and even found it quite funny.

‘But if an elderly Chinese person received one of these messages they would get very worried. Capita told me I received the message because I put in an application to the Home Office recently but it must have been 30 years since I last put one in and I didn’t have a mobile then.’

The Home Office claims only 14 people have been contacted in error.

Meanwhile, fresh coalition divisions emerged over the us of billboard vans telling illegal immigrants to 'go home'.

Immigration minister Mr Harper defended the tactic in a pilot this summer and suggested it could be used again.

He told BBC1's Question Time: 'I don’t see any problem with saying to people who have no right to be in the United Kingdom they can’t be here anymore.

'If it’s successful we’ll look at rolling it out, if it’s not successful, we won’t.'

Split: Tory Immigration minister Mark Harper (left) suggested the ad vans could be used again but Lib Dem Jeremy Browne defended himself from criticism that as a minister at the Home Office he failed to block the vans

Lib Dem Jeremy Browne, who was sacked as a home office minister last week, hit back at criticism from those around Nick Clegg that he failed to stop the vans ever being used.

He said: 'I wasn't told about the vans. I wasn't copied into the paper that was circulated in the Home Office.

'Now whether that was due to a deliberate political decision or was an administrative oversight, who knows?

'As an illustration into how stretched you can be in a department, when this controversy broke out I was on the other side of the world,' he told The Times.

'It's been reported I was on holiday. I wasn't. I was in the Far East of Asia as part of the international comparison of drug policy.

'The first thing I knew about the poster van is when I was in the lounge of Hong Kong airport and logged on to the computer to catch up with the news eight time zones away ... It seems unduly critical to be blamed for not stopping something I didn't know about.'
