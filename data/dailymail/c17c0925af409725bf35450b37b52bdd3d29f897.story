Andy Coulson told the phone hacking trial yesterday that his affair with Rebekah Brooks was ‘wrong’ and ‘shouldn’t have happened’.

Speaking for the first time about the on-off relationship, the former newspaper editor said he felt responsible for the pain it had caused his wife Eloise Patrick.

Coulson arrived at the Old Bailey hand-in-hand with his wife, and the mother of three watched from the public gallery as he gave his evidence, while Brooks looked on impassively from the dock.

The affair between Coulson and Brooks was revealed by the prosecution last year amid claims that it lasted for six years.

The
 jury has already heard Brooks, 45, admit the ‘dysfunctional’ fling.

She
 wrote an emotional love letter to Coulson in 2004 in which she 
described him as her ‘very best friend’ and told him: ‘I love you.’

Coulson,
 46, who later became Prime Minister David Cameron’s director of 
communications, spoke of his regret over the affair, which began in 
1998.

He told the court: ‘There was an affair that started in 1998 and 
ended quite soon after, but it did restart, as the court has heard.

‘It
 was not by any means continual. There were very long periods – very 
long periods – where the relationship was what it should have been, a 
good friendship.

'I don’t want to minimise it or excuse it. It was wrong 
and it shouldn’t have happened and I take my full share of 
responsibility for the pain it caused other people, not least my wife.’

Coulson
 admitted that the affair meant he shared confidences with Brooks, who 
later became editor of the Sun while he was editor of the News of the 
World.

But he denied the intimacy meant they had breached ‘professional standards or rules’.

The
 prosecution claim the relationship went on while the pair were at the 
centre of an alleged conspiracy to hack phones at the News of the World 
between 2000 and 2006.

Both 
deny the plot and Coulson said he had never heard of private detective 
Glenn Mulcaire – who has admitted phone hacking for the tabloid – until 
Mulcaire and royal editor Clive Goodman were arrested in 2006.

He
 said he had thought the newspaper’s £105,000-a-year contract with 
Mulcaire’s company was for legitimate surveillance and research and told
 the court the figure was not ‘massive’ in the Sunday newspaper’s 
£32million annual budget.

After
 becoming editor in 2003, he spent £22,000 on ‘flowers and alcohol’ as 
gifts for staff and contacts. When asked about the £105,000 contract, he
 said: ‘I don’t want to be dismissive but the reality is that it’s not a
 lot of money in the business.

‘We
 paid double that to the astrologer (Mystic Meg).’ Coulson said Mulcaire
 was already on the News of the World payroll when he took over as 
editor from Brooks, saying he ‘inherited’ the investigator.

He
 described an atmosphere of intrigue and secrecy at the now defunct 
Sunday tabloid and said he had been shocked by the ‘destructive’ rivalry
 between different departments, particularly news and features.

Coulson,
 of Charing, Kent, praised Brooks as a ‘supportive’ editor and said they
 had both wanted to change the ‘counter-productive’ competitive 
atmosphere at the newspaper.

Coulson
 resigned as editor in January 2007 after Goodman and Mulcaire were 
jailed for phone hacking, and he was appointed as the director of 
communications and planning for the Conservative Party in July that 
year.

After the 2010 
election, Coulson became Mr Cameron’s director of communications, 
overseeing a team of civil servants in Downing Street, but resigned in 
January 2011 amid growing speculation that he could face arrest as part 
of the phone hacking investigation.

Coulson today said he had had ‘sparing’ contact with former boss Rupert Murdoch since his resignation.

And
 of his contact with Mr Cameron, he said: ‘My family and I spent a 
weekend with him in the spring after I left. I have not spoken to him 
since.’

He added that the invitation came before he left his Downing Street job.

Coulson and Brooks both deny conspiring to hack phones or commit misconduct by paying public officials for information.

Brooks
 and her husband Charlie, who married in 2009, also deny conspiring to 
pervert the course of justice.

She was previously married to EastEnders 
actor Ross Kemp in 2002 and has admitted her affair with Coulson 
happened before and during that marriage.

All seven defendants in the trial, including Goodman, 56, deny all the charges against them. The trial continues.

The engagement of David Beckham to ‘Posh Spice’ Victoria Adams proved to be ‘a happy event all round’ when they made a deal over the story, the hacking trial has heard.

Andy Coulson said he counted the couple as good contacts during his time as showbiz editor at the Sun. He said they were ‘very effective in building a business with the media’.

He told the court about the story of their engagement.

Coulson said: ‘It was a deal with them. From memory, I cannot remember exactly. This is the day they were getting engaged. We were the only paper to get the interview.

‘We were the only paper to get the close-up on the ring. We then sold the pictures on and we made a deal for syndication.’

Judge Mr Justice Saunders commented: ‘A happy event all round.’

Coulson agreed, to laughs in the courtroom. The witness went on to say the rise of the Spice Girls roughly coincided with his career.

He said: ‘They were looking to promote their career.

‘They were looking to promote their first record. As, at the time, I did not make it to the office in the morning, they were so keen to build a relationship with the Sun they turned up at my house.

‘The Spice Girls was as much a marketing story as a pop story. The Beckhams was another example - they understood how the media works.

‘They were very effective in building a business with the media. Not the first, of course.’
