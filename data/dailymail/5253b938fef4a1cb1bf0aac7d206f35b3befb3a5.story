The New Jersey strip club that was the real-life stand-in for the infamous Bada Bing on HBO's 'Sopranos' has been hit  - again - by criminals.

Satin Dolls in Lodi was robbed by two armed men a few days before Christmas. 

Now, police say someone broke into the club early Friday morning.

Police tell The Record that the break-in occurred between 2 a.m. and 5 a.m. Friday. 

Robbed: Satin Dolls in New Jersey was targeted in an attempted burglary early today, nearly two weeks after another burglary at the club, also known as Bada Bing from HBO's The Sopranos, authorities said

Classic: On The Sopranos, which ran from 1999 to 2007, Satin Dolls was used as the site of the show's strip club Bada Bing, a perrenial hangout for Tony Soprano, played by James Gandolfini (pictured)

The would-be thieves smashed through the club's glass front door and pried open the office door to get to a safe, but did not take anything.

The earlier robbery - just a few days earlier on December 21 - cost the club about $30,000.

Detective Capt. Donald Scorzetti said the two crimes were not related. 

The Bada Bing was seen frequently on the show, which ran on HBO from 1999 to 2007.

It was a hangout and hotspot for the often-dirty dealings of Tony Soprano, played by James Gandolfini.

All interior and exterior shots of the Bada Bing were filmed at Satin Dolls, which is on Route 17.

The expansive bar was loosely based on Wiggles, a strip club owned by notorious New Jersey mobster Vincent Palermo, whose life and times inspired the series.

'Bada Bing' was a catchphrase in Sopranos that meant 'it's done'.  

 On its website, Satin Dolls says its ladies 'will have you so excited you'll be singing soprano.'
