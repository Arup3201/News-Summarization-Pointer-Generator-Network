British families face a hike in their phone and internet bills if Brussels bureaucrats wave through a controversial £10billion takeover bid for O2 by rival Three, the boss of one of the UK’s largest mobile firms has warned.

A proposed mega-merger between Hong Kong-owned Three and England Rugby sponsors O2 will be ruled on by the European Commission later this year.

But TalkTalk chief executive Dido Harding said allowing Brussels to clear the deal would be ‘really dangerous’.

She today called for the deal to be scrutinised in the UK amid growing fears it will be lead to rocketing prices for consumers.

‘People are right to be suspicious that the merging of the companies risks prices going up,’ she said in an interview with the Daily Mail.

Currently there are four mobile phone companies that own their own network in the UK – Vodafone, O2, EE and Three.

All of the other operators, such as TalkTalk or Virgin Mobile, rent their space on the airwaves of other companies.

But a merger between O2 and Three would see the number of companies operating a network drop from four to three.

Mrs Harding said: ‘In Austria, where four mobile operators went into three, prices went up. People are right to be suspicious about too much consolidation.’

It is not the only takeover currently in the offing.

BT is in talks to buy mobile group EE for £12.5billion.

That deal will be assessed by regulators in the UK’s Competition and Markets Authority because both companies are registered in Britain.

But under EU rules, the deal between O2 and Three must be looked at by Brussels even though ‘there are no European consumers affected by this deal at all,’ according to Harding.

The TalkTalk boss said it was ‘really dangerous’ for European regulators to clear the takeover.

She added: ‘There’s a risk that you end up with two different authorities looking at the same thing, and I think that’s really dangerous.

‘You can’t have them looked at separately, otherwise you will wake up in ten years’ time, and we won’t have choice and prices really will have gone up, and not by a bit, that they will have gone up very fundamentally.’

O2 is owned by Spanish telecoms giant Telefonica.

Three is owned by Hutchison Whampoa, a conglomerate owned by Hong Kong tycoon Li Ka-Shing, who already owns a large number of UK assets including Felixstowe port and London’s electricity network.
