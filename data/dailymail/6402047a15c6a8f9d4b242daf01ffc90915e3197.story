The Donald has been busy waging a Twitter battle – in the past 24 hours, he called President Obama’s re-election to office a ‘disgusting injustice’ and labelled NBC News anchor Brian William’s newscast as ‘boring.’

And a day after the election, The Donald is still going strong. The real estate mogul took to the social media site Wednesday to continue injecting his opinions into the Twitterverse.

He lamented that people unfairly criticized him for his unforgiving tweets on Obama, saying that other celebrities were ‘far harsher than me with political statements’ and that he was singled out.

Fighting words: Donald Trump again took to Twitter Wednesday to voice his feelings over how his tweets about President Obama were perceived

Spat: NBC's Brian Williams, left, criticised billionaire Donald Trump, right, after he went on a Twitter rant demanding a revolution after Obama's re-election. Trump has now hit back at Williams

Angry: On Wednesday, Trump predicted that Chrysler would set up shop in China, and that the country was happier about Obama's re-election than Chicagoans

He also singled out the U.S.’s 
relationship with China, predicting that American car companies would 
immediately leap at the opportunity move their factories abroad.

‘Now that the election is over,’ Trump wrote,’ watch Chrysler ship Jeep production to China – my prediction.’

He also said earlier Wednesday: 
‘Beijing had a bigger celebration than Chicago last night. The Chinese 
are happier with the election than we are.’

Following his Election Night rant, 
Trump backtracked over the series of scathing tweets he wrote about 
Obama as he secured a second term Tuesday night - hastily deleting 
messages calling for a 'revolution'.

And when Williams 
lambasted Trump's Twitter tantrum on his show, the outspoken business 
mogul turned his anger on the host and his 'boring' newscasts.

Trump took to the social networking site after the president's victory was projected by several news outlets on Tuesday night, and claimed the re-election was a 'great and disgusting injustice'.

After a barrage of outraged messages, Trump added: 'He lost the popular vote by a lot and won the election. We should have a revolution in this country!'

Minutes later, he deleted the tweet - 
perhaps aware of the potential legal ramifications of a remark seeking 
to incite a revolution against the president.

Litany: Trump later deleted parts of his rant, but has kept the majority of it, blasting the Electoral College and the direction of the nation

Williams read some of 
Trump's tweets on the air, while claiming he did so 
reluctantly, as he declared that the TV personality - whose show, 
Celebrity Apprentice, airs on NBC - had 'driven well past the last exit 
to relevance.'

'This is, as they say, out there and 
getting an airing tonight, so you might as well know about it,' Williams
 groaned. 'Donald Trump, who has driven well past the last exit to 
relevance and veered into something closer to irresponsible here, is 
tweeting tonight. Here's a sampling...'

Williams read several of Trump's tweets, which called the election a 'total sham and a travesty.'

However, as it became apparent that former Massachusetts governor Mitt Romney would not win the election, the Donald’s tweets became more enraged, and more hyperbolic.

Trump began with: 'Well, back to the drawing board!'

He
 quickly followed up with a call to revolution. The Trump wrote: 'He 
lost the popular vote by a lot and won the election. We should have a 
revolution in this country!' - before deleting the tweet.

But he was far from over. 'This 
election is a total sham and a travesty,' he wrote. 'We are not a 
democracy! He added America is in 'serious and unprecedented trouble like never before'.

Priorities: Trump endorsed Romney last February in Las Vegas and has outspokenly objected many of Obama's policies

Bowed: Romney delivered his concession speech early Wednesday morning in Boston after he lost to Obama

The 66-year-old later went onto 
attack the Electoral College, but offered a kernel of hope for the 
still-Republican House of Representatives.

‘Hopefully the House can hold our country together for four more years,’ Trump tweeted.

‘House
 shouldn’t give anything to Obama unless he terminates Obamacare.’ He 
did not tweet anything after Romney's gracious concession speech.

But he didn't keep his anger quiet for long, unleashing yet more scathing remarks on Wednesday morning - this time against Brian Williams, who uses the Twitter handle @bwilliams.

He wrote: '@bwilliams knows that I think his newscast has become totally boring so he took a shot at me last night.'

Second rant: on Wednesday, Trump turned on Brian Williams who had criticised his previous messages

'The only thing more boring than @bwilliams newscast is his show Rock Center which is totally dying in the ratings - a disaster!' he added, before asking him: 'Wouldn't you love to have my ratings?'

He went on: 'If I'm "well past the last exit to relevance" how come you spent so much time reading my tweets last night?'

Trump’s attacks on Obama have been more frequent in the weeks preceding the election.

Only
 last week, he lashed out at the commander-in-chief for using Superstorm
 Sandy to garner more votes and essentially buy the election.

The billionaire’s grudge hasn’t gone unnoticed by the president.

During
 a recent appearance on The Tonight Show With Jay Leno, Obama quipped 
that their rivalry began when the two were growing up in Kenya.

‘We had constant run-ins on the soccer field, he wasn’t that good,’ Obama told the NBC late-night host.

Offer he could refuse: Ahead of the election, Trump offered to pay $5million to the charity of President Obama's choice if he released his college and passport records

Victory: President Obama waves as he walks on stage with first lady Michelle Obama and daughters Malia and Sasha at his election night party

Cheers: Obama and the family were met with cheering at McCormick Place in Chicago

Obama said on Leno that the two have never actually met.

During a campaign stop in swing state New Hampshire last month, Obama again joked about his birth certificate.

He joked that Mitt Romney had made it too expensive for him to get a birth certificate.'He raised fees to get a birth certificate which would have been expensive for me,' the president said.

The
 joke was met with laughter and cheers, and was a veiled reference to 
so-called 'birthers' who doubt he was born in America and question the 
authenticity of his Hawaiian birth certificate.
