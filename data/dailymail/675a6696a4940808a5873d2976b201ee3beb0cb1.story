Controlled: Police deliberately detonated the suspect device, causing a loud explosion heard for miles

Police in San Francisco have detonated a suspected bomb found near the city center, causing an explosion that could be heard for miles.

Officers were called to the Sunset District at around 6pm yesterday after reports that a suspicious device had been found in a home in 1400 block on 46th Avenue.

After evacuating the local area, San Francisco Police Departmentâ€™s bomb squad conducted a controlled explosion that sparked several small fires in and around neighbouring houses.

Officers from the San Francisco Fire Department subsequently attended the scene and the fires were said to be under control by 8.57pm.

SFPD spokesman Gordon Shy was quick to allay concerns that the explosion had been a terror attack, pointing out that any blast heard in San Francisco area had been caused by officers.

He added that nobody had been injured in either the detonation or in any of the resulting fires. Firefighters confirmed they had responded to a small fire at 8.46pm near 46th Avenue and Judah Street. 

They added that the blaze was under control within minutes. 

A number of streets in the area remain closed as police continue investigating the suspicious device.The N-Judah Muni metro line railway has also been redirected due to the police activity.

After the initial blast, dozens of people called police to voice concerns over a possible terrorist attack in the city.

Officers quickly released a statement asking local residents to remain calm and spread the message that it was in fact police who caused the blast.

The statement read: 'Please advise the
 citizens in the area that explosion heard was due to the bomb squad 
detonating the device.'

It added: 'They determined this was the safest way to secure the device. There are no more hazards and the scene is secure'.
