The Duchess of Cornwall shone in a floor-length evening gown last night and today the duchesses, queens and princesses of Europe dressed to impress too at the inauguration of King Willem.

The new Queen Maxima looked sensational, and very regal, in a dramatic electric blue gown with matching shawl and sash, her hair in an elegant up-do and with a stunning crown placed atop her head.

Camilla, too, chose blue for the grand occasion but her icy Bruce Oldfield gown was more pared down than many of the other bold and glamorous looks on display in Amsterdam.

Dresses in bright colours such as coral and hot pink, tomato red, lilac and forest green sashayed in to the Nieuwe Kerk church like royal jewels.

After Queen Maxima the Dutch princesses came out on top with the most eye-catching gowns of the day.

Princess Annette opted for a structured body-con style monochrome fishtail dress somewhat reminiscent of a dress Beyoncé wore to the Met Ball in 2011 while her husband Prince Bernhard looked equally fashionable, if a little informal, working a light stubble, messy hair and thick-rimmed glasses.

Dutch princess Laurentien stepped out in a fitted peep-hole number accessorised with matching netted hat and silk shawl.

Princess Mathilde of Belgium and Marie-Helene Angela van der Broek of Orange-Nassau stepped out in shades of pink.

While princess Mathilde went for a sugary coral pink in simple fabric and cut, Marie-Hélène opted for a hot fuchsia in heavy lace. Her dress was still fitted and she topped her outfit off with a matching pill box hat and small clutch bag. Her peep-toe shoes also matched in colour perfectly.

Crown Princess Victoria of Sweden opted for nude - the colour being the safest thing about her outfit. She looked sensational in a thigh-split fitted frock and large matching hat. She added matching stiletto platform shoes and a clutch bag.

Her husband Prince Daniel look understatedly chic with his thick rimmed glasses and slicked back hair, paired off nicely with a crisp bow tie and shiny shoes.

Princess Sophie of Bavaria went for a bright mint number with matching headband and shawl. Her black clutch bag stood out in contrast along with her red sash.

The Duchess of Cornwall looked royally stylish in an ice blue frock

The Duchess has earned plaudits for her regal style during the visit and was yesterday wearing an ice blue gown by designer Bruce Oldfield and matching feathered headdress by Philip Treacy that was an exact replica of the one she wore on her wedding day.

While it is not unusual to see royal males wearing a cabinet-full of medals, Camilla was also sporting a vast array of regalia.

On her left shoulder was her Family Order, a portrait of the Queen as a young woman set in diamonds and suspended from a ribbon.

The brooch used to pin her sash to her shoulder is a piece of her personal 
jewellery while her pearl and diamond choker is a Parker Bowles family 
heirloom.

George IV started the formal practice of presenting Family Orders and the practice has been continued by his successors.

Each sovereign commissions a unique portrait of themselves which is suspended on a different coloured ribbon - George V used white, George VI favoured rose pink while the Queen's is chartreuse yellow. 

The Orders are now worn on formal occasions by female members of the Royal Family only, although more than one Order can be worn at the same time. For example, Queen Elizabeth The Queen Mother wore the Orders of both The Queen and George VI.

Camilla’s royal blue sash with a cross suspended from it and the bejewelled star pinned on her waist are all part of the insignia of a Grand Dame Cross of the Royal Victorian Order.

The Queen awarded her daughter-in-law her highest personal honour last year to mark her seventh wedding anniversary to Prince Charles.

The Order was founded in April 1896 by Queen Victoria and honours are in the Queen's personal gift, independent of Downing Street. They are given by the head of state to people who have served her or the monarchy in a personal way.

As a Grand Dame Cross Camilla boasts the letters GCVO after her name (as do several other senior female royals including Princess Anne, the Countess of Wessex and the Duchess of Gloucester).

Announcing the news last year palace sources told the Mail that the award recognised the Duchess's hard work as a member of the monarchy.

At a time when most women her age would be looking forward to a slower pace of life, she now carries out hundreds of royal engagements each year.Camilla has also taken on a wide range of patronages and travelled extensively overseas with the prince on official visits.

Of course Charles was no slack in the style stakes today either, wearing the Admiral of the Fleet Full Ceremonial Uniform with sword, medals and the Cross of the Order of the Crown (the Cross of the Order of the Crown is awarded by the Dutch Sovereign for service to the Dutch Royal Household).

In the boldest frock of all, Princess Lalla Salma of Morocco arrived at Nieuwe Kerk church in a dramatic forest green silk and velvet dress and super high gold heels.

The raven royal wore her hair half up half down allowing her curls to cascade down her back.

Her attention commanding choice of outfit was somewhat Medieval in style with heavy embroidery and plenty of gold accents.

Spain's Princess Letizia and Crown Princess Mette-Marit of Norway went for delicate dove grey dresses with matching hats.

Their flapper influence was clear through Letizia's sheer beaded top and Mette-Marit's beaded head piece.
