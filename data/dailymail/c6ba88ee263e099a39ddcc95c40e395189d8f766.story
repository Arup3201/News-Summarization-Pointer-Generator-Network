BT Sport was today forced to apologise after cutting to an advert break while the Newcastle United manager and captain were laying wreaths on the seats of two fans who died in the MH17 disaster.

Producers only cut back to the Newcastle v Sydney FC match - following five adverts for other brands and one for their own - for half of the minute’s silence for John Alder, 63, and Liam Sweeney, 28.

Viewers took to Twitter to vent their fury, describing BT Sport's coverage of this morning’s game in New Zealand as 'useless' and a 'complete disgrace', while another said: 'Well done the money men.'

Tribute: Newcastle United manager Alan Pardew (left) and captain Fabricio Coloccini carry the wreaths

In memory: The programme cut to adverts as Pardew and Coloccini walked up the stand in tribute

The programme cut to adverts as Newcastle manager Alan Pardew and captain Fabricio Coloccini were walking up the stand at Forsyth Barr Stadium in Dunedin to place the tributes to the fans.

This was followed by adverts for Birds Eye, SEAT, Strongbow, McDonald’s and Expedia - as well as a promotional clip for the channel’s coverage of an Arsenal v Manchester City match next month.

Newcastle fan Ryan Brooks said on Twitter: 'BT Sport, [I] think it's awful and disrespectful you cut to adverts as they were laying wreaths in the stands - poor, poor on your front.

And season ticket holder Daniel Goodall said: 'BT Sport - well done on cutting to adverts when flowers were getting placed, and managing to miss the majority of the minute’s silence. Disgrace.’

Bill Grieves added: ‘BT Sport - 
would have been nice to have shown the full silence for the two 
Newcastle fans rather than adverts. Fail.’

Flowers: The tribute from Pardew and Coloccini came before Newcastle beat Sydney 4-0 in New Zealand

But a BT Sport spokesman told MailOnline 
that the channel was sorry for what happened, saying: ‘We apologise for 
any upset caused by a mistimed break during the Newcastle game.

‘The timing was unintentional, and we will show the tributes and the minute’s silence in full at the end of the game, as well as put all the footage online.’

This was later welcomed by Newcastle fans, with 'Yorkshire Sam' saying on Twitter: 'Good that BT Sport replayed the minute's silence at the end. They should never have cut to the adverts in the first place.'

The channel also later posted on tweet linking a video of coverage of the tribute on its website.

Emmanuel Riviere, a £5million summer signing from Monaco, marked his debut with a goal on 26 minutes as Newcastle cruised to a 4-0 victory over Sydney FC in the friendly.

Rest in peace: Coloccini carries a wreath of flowers in memory of the fans prior to the game against Sydney

Before kick-off, Pardew and Coloccini laid wreaths on the seats which would have been occupied by Mr Alder and Mr Sweeney who died in the plane crash last Thursday while en route to New Zealand.

The Magpies scored three times in 14 
first-half minutes as Siem de Jong took full advantage of goalkeeper 
Ivan Necevski's 19th-minute error before Riviere and then Mapou 
Yanga-Mbiwa struck.

Newcastle keeper Rob Elliot had only one save to make to deny Corey Gameiro after the break, and substitute Adam Armstrong rounded off the scoring seven minutes from time.

After the game, Pardew said of the fact the men's bodies have not yet been returned from Ukraine to their families: 'The after effects of the plane crash haven’t been great.

'They are having to suffer that as families and we are as fans too. The site has not been secured and the publicity around it hasn’t been great.'

Pardew had earlier insisted that the forthcoming season would be dedicated to the two fans who died on the Malaysia Airlines flight. He said: ‘None of us would be sitting here without the fans.

Reaction: BT Sport faced an angry backlash from Twitter after the 'mistimed break'

‘Owners and managers come and go, as do players, but the fans are always there, and these two guys in particular, to go to the lengths that they did to get out here, has brought home just how important supporters are to us.

‘Sometimes when you lose lives in that manner, it puts into context what we do. This season we want to give their families something to remember them by, by having a successful season.’

Pardew also thanked the Sunderland fans who put their usual rivalry to one side and have now raised more than £23,000 in tribute to Mr Sweeney and Mr Alder. ‘A lot is made of the rivalry between the two cities, and of course that is there,’ he said.

‘But I would like to thank all the Sunderland fans who have paid tribute and helped raise a staggering amount already. I am very proud of Sunderland Football Club for the way they have conducted themselves and I want to thank them.’

Newcastle faced Sydney FC in their opening fixture in the southern hemisphere, and Pardew had vowed to play a strong team to help honour the two fans.

Ten Britons were among 298 people killed when the Malaysia Airlines jet was shot out of the sky at 33,000ft as it travelled from Amsterdam to Kuala Lumpur last Thursday.
