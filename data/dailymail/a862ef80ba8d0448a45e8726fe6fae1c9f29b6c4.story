Free food: The cafes at Google officers are world-renowned for offering gourmet food - breakfast, lunch and dinner - for free to all employees

Google employees get free fitness classes, including yoga, as well as free access to gyms

The results are based on thousands of anonymous reviews by employees on Glassdoor, which advertises job postings and also advises prospective employees on office culture, leadership and salary negotiation.  

It's little wonder that Google is so popular - with average salaries of $125,000 for software engineers and a host of world-renowned perks.

Employees enjoy free gourmet breakfast lunch - and even dinner - at the company's food courts. The food is so legendary that Hemispheres, the cafeteria at Google's New York office, is one of the highest-rated restaurants on Yelp. 

Free buses, equipped with wifi, shuttle them to and from Google's Mountain Veiw, California, campus - the Googleplex.

Employees also have free access to an on-campus gym and workout classes, as well a free massages. 

Google's 80/20 program allowed employees to pursue their passions in their jobs. The company lets employees spend 80percent of their work time on their traditional jobs and 20percent on projects that they think will help the company.

Google also offers great traditional benefits for its 55,000 employees - including 18 weeks of maternity leave (and bonuses are still paid), six weeks of paid paternity leave and 'baby bucks' to pay for diapers once the little one is born.

When parents do return to work, Google offers free, onsite childcare. 

Prefer a furry companion to children? Google's got your back. Employees are encouraged to bring their dogs to work.  

Google supplants Bain & Company  as Glassdoor.com's employer of the year. Tech rival Facebook, which fell to No. 13 this year, came in tops in 2013 and 2009.
