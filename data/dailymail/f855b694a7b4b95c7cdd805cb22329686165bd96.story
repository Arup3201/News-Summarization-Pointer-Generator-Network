A Brisbane woman who decided to have a double mastectomy after being told she had an increased risk of getting breast cancer has emotionally declared she will not get sick from a rare gene mutation that has been passed down three generations.

Elise Worthington, 25, inherited the same BRCA1 cancer gene that saw her great grandmother and grandmother diagnosed with breast cancer and her mother diagnosed with incurable ovarian cancer last month.

Ms Worthington, an ABC journalist, underwent her double mastectomy on Tuesday night as the ABC's 7.30 program aired video diaries of her decision to have the preventative surgery and the moment she learned her mum Sylvia may only live for another two years.

'Mum's just told me her cancer has returned that she was in remission from. I knew it was going to come back at some point,' Ms Worthington said in tears.

'It's been five months since she stopped chemo. I just hoped she wouldn't have to go through it again so soon.

'I'll help her get through it and I'm going to get through it and she's going to be the last woman in this family to get sick from this gene and I'm going to be fine.'

Ms Worthington said she made the decision to have the mastectomy, famously underwent by Hollywood actress Angelina Jolie who had the same BRCA1 gene, before her mother was diagnosed with cancer again last month.

Ms Worthington made the decision to remove her breasts back in May but said the reality of her decision has only recently hit her

'As I struggle with the idea of losing part of me, I am also learning how to cope with the idea of losing my mother,' she said.Â 

'We don't know how long she will live, maybe one year, or two.'

The risk of a woman with the BRCA1 gene developing breast cancer is between 40 and 65 per cent.

'I'm feeling scared and looking forward to it being over and done with,' she said in her final video diary before the procedure.

'It's just kind of hit me in the last couple of days what I'm doing and doing it so publicly as well.

'But I've found it's been such a struggle these past couple of months working out what the right thing for me to do it.'

Ms Worthington said the reason she shared her decision on national television was to encourage people to speak about gene mutations, like the BRCA1 gene, early to avoid situations like her own.

'If I had seen something like this with my mum maybe we could have spoken about our family history more and maybe she would have been tested and maybe she wouldn't be in the situation she's in now,' Ms Worthington said.
