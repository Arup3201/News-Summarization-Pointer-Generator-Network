Liverpool striker Daniel Sturridge had a late night this week but his manager Brendan Rodgers has nothing to worry about.

The supermarket was Sturridge's choice of night spot as the 25-year-old, recovering from a thigh problem, stocked up on some healthy foods.

Sturridge posted a picture on Instagram of him at the Sainsbury's checkout with the message: 'Late night shop... What's everyone's fave food?'

Pineapple, cucumber, spinach, olive oil and Corn Flakes were on Sturridge's list.

The Liverpool striker picked up an injury while on international duty with England in September

Sturridge has been injured for over a month and Liverpool have struggled in his absence 

Sturridge is on the road to recovery having been out of action since the beginning of September when he suffered a thigh strain on international duty before England's Euro 2016 qualifier in Switzerland.

In his absence, Liverpool were beaten by Aston Villa and West Ham in the Premier League and also went down to Basle in the Champions League.

Liverpool take on QPR at Loftus Road on Sunday before a European showdown with Real Madrid at Anfield next Wednesday.
