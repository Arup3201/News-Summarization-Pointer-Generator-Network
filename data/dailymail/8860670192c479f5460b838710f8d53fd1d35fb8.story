Authorities are investigating another possible case of hazing connected to Florida A&M University band.

The Tallahassee Police Department has opened an investigation into the alleged battery of 18-year-old Bria Shante Hunter.

The freshman clarinet player suffered a fractured thigh bone and damaged knee.

Hunter's parents told Atlanta's WXIA-TV on Tuesday that when their daughter returned to Georgia she couldn't bend her legs.

Officer David Northway confirmed they are investigating whether the injuries came from hazing.

A police report states the alleged 
battery started September 15 and continued through November 7, shortly 
before drum major Robert Champion collapsed outside an Orlando hotel and
died. Investigators have linked his death to hazing.

The new allegations came the same day that hundreds of people mourned Champion at an Atlanta-area church.

The 26-year-old junior was found dead 
November 19 on a bus parked outside an Orlando, Florida, hotel after the
school's football team lost to a rival. Police said Champion, a 
clarinet player, had been vomiting and complained he couldn't breathe 
shortly before he collapsed, but they have not released any other 
details.

Hunter's father said today that he was at Champion's funeral and could not immediately comment.

Since Champion's death, the band director at the historically black university in Tallahassee, Julian White, has been fired.

White said he saw Champion shortly after he was found unconscious and assured the family that he 'looked in peace.'

'This is a difficult time for me. You 
may see me smile, and you probably won't see me cry,' he said. 'I'm 
happy that I knew Robert.'

James Ammons, the school president, pledged to 'stamp out hazing at FAMU.'

'I vow that Robert's death will not be in vain,' he said.

The school has announced an independent probe and

The group that oversees Florida's 
public universities announced Tuesday it wanted to investigate whether 
the school did enough to respond to hazing.

Tragic: Drum major Robert Champion died November 19th after vomiting and complaining he couldn't breathe

Violence: Former bandmates and police told WSB-TV that Mr Champion had walked through a line of band members who punched him before his death

Meanwhile, in a poignant call to action, speakers at Champion's funeral called for an end to the hazing linked to his death.

Eight former band mates saluted 
Champion by walking toward his open casket. They raised their batons in 
unison, then abruptly turned to show their capes embroidered with the 
letters: C-H-A-M-P-I-O-N. Near the end of the funeral, one of the 
college junior's favourite songs, 'Flight of the Bumblebee,' played over 
the loudspeaker.

Pastor John Tatum told hundreds of 
friends and family who crowded the church pews that it was time to end 
the 'foolish' hazing in college fraternities and marching bands.

'If there's anything about this man's 
legacy we need to put a stop to, it's hazing,' he said to a chorus of 
amens. 'I call upon every parent, every mother, every father... do what 
is necessary now to stop this tragedy from ever happening again. Right 
now.'

The funeral resonated with the music Champion was so passionate about.

The Southwest DeKalb High School 
marching band, where Champion attended, played somber melodies and were 
joined by an 18-member church choir behind his casket, where he lie 
wearing his college uniform, clutching a gleaming baton.

At the start of the service, 
Champion's mother, Pam, squeezed her son's hand a final time. His 
father, Robert Sr, whispered into his son's ear.

Champion fell in love with music when 
he was about age six. He started in bands in middle school and his 
mother said he was so enthusiastic about performances she called him 
'Mr. Band.'

He long dreamed of joining a marching 
band, and neighbors recalled seeing him patrolling his yard with a 
makeshift baton made of tape. He rose to become the leader of his high 
school band by his junior year, and was tapped as the drum major of 
Florida A&M's prestigious 'Marching 100' in late 2010. The band has 
performed at Super Bowls, the Grammys and presidential inaugurations.

James Seda, who leads the high school 
band, said Champion was an enthusiastic leader and outgoing musician 
with an amazing work ethic. He said he was thankful he was in Orlando to
see Champion's final show at halftime against Bethune-Cookman.

'His last performance is always his best performance,' he said. 'He always outdoes himself.'

The family's attorney has said they intend to sue the school over the death.
