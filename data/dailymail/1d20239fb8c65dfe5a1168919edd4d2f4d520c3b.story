These are the astonishing scenes of Chinese farmers scraping chillies from the road side in Turpan - China's hottest city.

Strewn across the floor, they have been sizzling for days to reach optimum flavour.

Unlike in Britain, the farmers have no need to worry about how the weather will treat their crop.

With an average of 28 days a year above 40C, the skies are unwaveringly bright and locals have become used to the searing hot aroma that steams from their streets.

Scorching: Workers wade through the chillies which have been laid out during the 28 days of temperatures above 40C in order to best preserve the hot pepper's flavour

Drying chillies is a classic method for preserving the hot pepper's flavour before it passes its prime.

It is also an ideal way for farmers to sell their produce as it can be crushed, divided, and sent to markets around the region or the country.

Since getting a taste for exotic foods, Brits are starting to attempt amateur chilli drying in ovens and gardens - weather-depending.

But all online tutorials tout outdoor-dried peppers as the ultimate delicacy.

They are raked in their millions into large sacks and carted to the markets for locals and tourists.

The peppers are collected and sold at the market for locals and tourists. It is the basic ingredient in most foods of the region including spicy kebab and hot soup

And once bought, the chilli peppers and red pepper flakes 
produced are the foundation of most food in the country's north 
western Xinjiang region.

Signature dishes include spicy kebabs, hot soups and stir fries.

The baking hot city has an average temperature of 15C all year round - and 152 days of summer - making it ideal conditions for growing melons and grapes.

While the spicy and sweet aromas fill the air, people pass their time buried in sand up to 60C - a tradition known as 'sand therapy'.

As a spicy aroma fills the city's air, many do 'sand therapy': lying beneath 60C sand, which is said to cleanse the skin. A far cry from Brighton beach for summer fun
