Ralph Ellis runs you through what we've learned this weekend, from Euro 2016 qualifying action to the lower leagues. This week, there as a win for England over Slovenia at Wembley, a precious point for Wales in Belgium and plenty going on in Leagues One and Two.

1. Jack Wilshere’s man of the match award against Slovenia at Wembley suggests he’s finally living up to his early promise as an England player.

The Arsenal midfielder has now started six games in a row for England – his longest run in the side since Fabio Capello first picked him as a raw 19-year-old in 2011.

The Slovenia victory was Wilshere’s 25th cap – but only the third time he has completed all 90 minutes of an international.

2. One of Chris Coleman’s cutest moves was to convince Hull centre back James Chester, born in Warrington, that he could play international football for Wales thanks to his mother being born in Rhyl.

The 25-year-old was outstanding alongside Swansea’s Ashley Williams as the Welsh held Group B favourites Belgium to a goalless draw in Brussels.

Chester gave the ball away only twice in 90 minutes and made nine clearances – including one that turned Adnan Januzaj’s dangerous cross away from the goal line.

In the four qualifying games in which Chester has started, Wales have conceded just two goals.

3. Former England manager Fabio Capello signed a contract in January to be Russia’s boss until 2018 – but it’s beginning to look very unlikely he will still be in charge next year, let alone when they host the World Cup.

Capello hasn’t been paid since his side flopped out of the group stage in Brazil back in June, with Russian FA officials whispering they can’t afford his £8.6million a year salary.

A 1-0 defeat away to Group G leaders Austria in Vienna on Saturday night won’t have done much to encourage them to find ways of coming up with the cash.

4. Sweden was once a fertile hunting ground for English scouts searching for bargain players, but no longer, it seems.

Sunderland’s Seb Larsson was the only member of Erik Hamren’s 22-man squad that drew 1-1 in Montenegro who is currently playing in the Premier League.

And Larsson, a starter in his country’s 1-1 draw with Russia last month, found himself only on the bench this time before getting on for the last half hour.

5. Roy Carroll naturally earned plaudits for dashing home from Romania to keep a clean sheet in Notts County’s win at Coventry – but an even better effort was made by Rochdale’s Matty Lund.

The 23-year-old midfielder, an unused substitute for Northern Ireland, needed two flights and a fast car to get back in time to play for Keith Hill’s side at Port Vale.

He flew from Bucharest to Frankfurt, then caught another plane to Manchester, before dashing down the M6 only to find himself on the bench again.

Lund, a former Stoke youth player, got on for the last 28 minutes but to no avail as Michael Brown’s goal gave the home side a 1-0 win.

6. The BBC’s commitment to sport remains questionable when they can’t be bothered to run The Football League show on international weekends.

No Championship games took some of the glamour out of the weekend but there were still enough big games in Leagues One and Two that were worth covering.

In all more than 136,000 people paid to see the 22 games over the weekend. As a comparison, a week ago the Italian Serie A attracted 205,000 fans.

7. Mame Biram Diouf’s first attempt to make it in English football flopped when he couldn’t make it at Manchester United – it maybe didn’t help that he was handed the number 32 shirt previously worn by Carlos Tevez.

Second time round in the Premier League, and at the age of 26, he’s showing signs of being ready for the challenge with four goals in 10 starts so far for Stoke.

The renewed confidence, helped by getting nearly a goal every two games playing for Hannover 96 in the Bundesliga, is also showing in his international appearances for Senegal. It was Diouf’s goal that clinched a 1-0 win over Egypt to put his country into the finals of the Africa Cup of Nations.

8. Southampton’s production line of players never seems to stop. Watch out for their England youth international Jack Stephens to be the next to make an impact in the Premier League.

The 20-year-old, on loan at Swindon, is normally a central defender but was called into service as an emergency midfielder against Bristol City and was outstanding in the 1-0 win that ended the 22-game unbeaten run of the League One leaders.

9. James Collins is rebuilding his career at Shrewsbury after a nightmare spell in Scotland when his £200,000 move to Hibernian turned sour.

The 23-year-old striker was told in the summer he could leave Easter Road despite having two years left on the contract he signed when he moved north  from Swindon in 2013.

His goal in Saturday’s 2-0 win over Mansfield was his eighth of this season, already two more than the former Aston Villa trainee scored in a miserable year that ended with Hibs getting relegated.

10. Keith Curle appeared to have taken a mission impossible when he returned to management in charge of a Carlisle team who were rock bottom of the Football League and without a win all season.

Two months later he’s lifted them six points clear of the relegation places after the 1-0 victory against Accrington which was his fifth win in eight games.

Key has been the signing of free agent Derek Asamoah. The striker hadn’t played in England since 2007 when he walked out of Shrewsbury to force a move to Nice – and since then has been in Scotland, Bulgaria and South Korea before coming home without a club to go to.

The 33-year-old former Ghana international got his fourth goal in five games against Accrington.
