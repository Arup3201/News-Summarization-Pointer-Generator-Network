A mother spent hours surfing the internet while her two-year-old son lay dying after being beaten savagely by his 12-year-old half-brother, prosecutors claim.

Biannela Susana waited almost four hours before seeking medical help for her son David Galarriago after he had been beaten unconscious.

The 25-year-old looked at sites about Pippa Middleton and David and Victoria Beckham, was on email and did online banking as her son lay critically injured.

Biannela Susana is charged with manslaughter and Christian Fernandez 
murder for the death of her son David, 2. She spent four hours surfing 
the web after Christian allegedly beat David before seeking medical help

Prosecutors said she was aware of the injuries to her son as she looked at medical sites to try and get information about child concussions.

She also spent time on the Wikipedia page for 'coma'.

Prosecutors said by the time her son was rushed to hospital it was too late to save him due to severity of his injuries.

Cristian Fernandez, 12, could become America's youngest ever 'lifer' after being charged as an adult over the murder of his brother at their home in Jacksonville, Florida, last June.

Fernandez is accused of slamming his brother's head into a book shelf causing the toddler to die from blunt force trauma.

The youngster was branded a danger to the public when prosecutors brought the first degree murder charge. He had broken his brother's leg in a previous assault and had a history of violence.

As her son lay unconscious, Susana googled for music videos and 
information about celebrities like the Beckhams and Pippa Middleton

She also searched for information on concussions and what to do 'when someone gets knocked out'

Announcing the adult murder charge against the 12-year-old State Attorney Angela Corey said;' 'It's one where you go, at what point do you step in, so you prevent another murder, and that's how we felt in this case.

'If we don't intervene now and do the tough thing. We have to protect the public from this young man.'

A 200-page report by investigators has revealed how the boys' mother spent four hours on the internet while her son lay dying.

As well as looking at celebrity sites, 
Susana also watched YouTube and went to a music download website and 
looked at songs off of an album called 'My Destiny.'

Police said Susana had logged on to the computer at 10.54 and her last search was after 3pm, after which she finally called for medical help

If Cristian is convicted he could become America's youngest ever 'lifer' after being charged as an adult over the murder

A forensic examination of her laptop computer showed that she googled the phrase 'when someone gets knocked out' at 10.54am. She went to a site about concussion 11 times during a 20 minute period.

As well as viewing celebrity sites she also did some online banking before looking up the website for St Luke's Hospital where he son would be taken.

Police said Susana had logged on to the computer at 10.54 and her last search was after 3pm.

Doctors have said her son might have survived had he been taken to hospital soon after being knocked unconscious.

His injuries were so severe when he was admitted to St Luke's Hospital that he was flown by helicopter to Shands Jacksonville hospital's trauma unit where he died two days later without regaining consciousness.

Susana has been charged with aggravated manslaughter.
