Accused: Brenda Watts was arrested for allegedly stealing $1m from school lunch line

A dinner lady has been accused of stealing more than $1million from pupils' lunch money during five years manning the canteen tills.

Former cafeteria manager Brenda Watts has been arrested by police in Fulton County, Georgia.

The alleged thefts took place at North Springs High School in north Fulton County.

Police claim this was a long-running and extremely profitable theft scheme.

A whistleblower has provided detectives with a video from inside the North Springs cafeteria.

It apparently Watts bypassing four lines that each had a cash register to keep track of the money, instead taking the money before it could be passed through the records.

Now Fulton County school police obtained 10 arrest warrants for Watts.

The warrants accuse Watts of stealing $500 a day from the cafeteria.

The whistleblower Beth Walsh said the a la carte line had been running 'at least 15 years, up to maybe 20.'

The police charge suggest that Watts stole $500 a day.

That's $2,500 a week, which is a staggering $90,000 in a school year.

Over 15 years, that would be $1,350,000.

According to the arrest warrants, Watts lives in a five-bedroom, 5,400 square-foot home in south DeKalb County.

Watts retired last June, the day after Channel 2 Action News aired the first story about North Springs.

She had been with the school system for 26 years.

Position of trust:Brenda Watts, former cafeteria manager at North Spring High School in Fulton County, is alleged to have taken around $500 a day for at least five years from payments made for food

Walsh was fired but said she does not regret blowing the whistle.

'You know, just, if you feel like something's going on, look into it. You could be wrong. But if you're right, you're doing the right thing,' Walsh said.

In a statement issued by Deputy Fulton County School Superintendent Patrick Burke, he said: 'Beyond taking appropriate personnel actions, when a potential crime occurs, we will investigate and work with law enforcement to prosecute to the full extent of the law.'
