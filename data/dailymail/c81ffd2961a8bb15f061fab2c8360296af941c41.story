QPR midfielder Alejandro Faurlin is set for a prolonged spell on the sidelines after it was confirmed by the club that he has suffered his third anterior cruciate ligament injury in as many years.

Faurlin limped off during the second half of Rangers' Capital One cup defeat at Burton Albion on Wednesday, but initial observations were that the injury was not as serious as now revealed.

The 28-year-old is set be missing from Harry Redknapp’s squad for a number of months, and the news will come as a devastating blow to the Argentinean midfielder, who has battled back from two previous ACL injuries.

Blow: Alejandro Faurlin is set for another prolonged spell on the sidelines after suffering a third ACL injury

Support: QPR defender Danny Simpson expresses his sadness at the news of Faurlin's latest injury

Faurlin penned a new one-year deal at Loftus Road in July having spent a portion of last season on loan at Palermo in an attempt to improve his fitness.

QPR boss Harry Redknapp, who may now look for another midfielder before the transfer window shuts on Monday, expressed his sympathy for Faurlin via the club's official Twitter feed: 'We're all desperately saddened and disappointed for Ale,' he said.

'We will, of course, do everything we can to support him and help him back on the road to recovery.

'He is a great man and player, and he's suffered terribly bad luck over the last few years with injuries.' 

Faurlin started QPR’s opening  Premier League defeat at home by Hull before coming off the bench in the 4-0 loss to London rivals Tottenham last weekend.

QPR’s head of medical services, Peter Florida-James, said: ‘The knee itself stayed pretty stable, but the scans have since revealed his ACL graft has ruptured. If he has a repair it will be a six- to nine-month injury, which is absolutely devastating for all concerned.

'It looked so innocuous on Wednesday night, so this has come as a massive blow for us all.' 

Gutted: Joey Barton paid tribute to injured team-mate Alejandro Faurlin on Twitter 

The club's players, including Joey Barton and Danny Simpson, offered their support to their injured team-mate. 

Barton said: 'Devastated for @alefaurlin. Know how hard he has worked to get back from injury. Words fail to capture my feelings for him right now. 

'We are all with him and have the utmost confidence that a man with his strength of personality and character will get through this. 

'As a team and club it's important we rally round him and support him at difficult times. Puts things into perspective.'

In better news for the Loftus Road club, manager Redknapp is ready to sign a new contract to extend his stay beyond the end of his current deal despite a poor start to the season.

‘It’s there, Tony’s offered me an extension for two years and I’ll sign it,’ Redknapp said.

‘I haven’t read it, I probably won’t read it, I’ll just sign it.’

Meanwhile, Adel Taarabt's move to  AC Milan looks to be off after the Italian club moved closer to signing Chelsea's Fernando Torres.
