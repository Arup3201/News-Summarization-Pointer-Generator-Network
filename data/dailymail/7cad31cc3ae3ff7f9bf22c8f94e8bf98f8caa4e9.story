For film fans who have always wanted to follow in the footsteps of Audrey Hepburn or Harrison Ford, it is the perfect pilgrimage.

An exclusive travel company is selling a 90-day, around-the-world trip which stops off at 20 locations used in Hollywood's biggest blockbusters.

The jet-setters will visit Tiffany's in New York, run wild like Braveheart in Scotland and visit the cocktail bar from Lost In Translation in Japan - but it will set them back £200,000.

Temple: Film fans will visit Petra in Jordan, one of the locations used in Indiana Jones And The Last Crusade

Ancient: The Al Khazneh, which was built in the First Century AD, was used in the film as the entrance to the temple housing the Holy Grail

Paradise: Part of the once-in-a-lifetime holiday includes a trip to Ko Phi Phi Leh in Thailand, the paradise setting used in The Beach

Iconic: A guided tour of New York jewellery store Tiffany's, where Audrey Hepburn starred in Breakfast At Tiffany's in 1961, is included

Brief encounters: There is also a chance to drink cocktails in the bar at Park Hyatt Hotel in Tokoyo where Bill Murray and Scarlett Johansson met in the Lost In Translation

The 64,852-mile journey spans ten 
countries including the US, Peru, France, Jordan, Thailand and Japan 
- and will give travellers the chance to experiences the locations of movies including Indiana Jones And The Last Crusade, The Beach, 
Notting Hill, Amelie and Lost In Translation.

It was created by Marcel Knobil, 
founder of the travel company VeryFirstTo, after three months of planning with his team and partners at travel company Unmissable.

Mr Knobil said: 'This is an absolute dream 
for the film and travel lover. The locations we have chosen often 
eclipsed the actors as the true stars of the film and have become 
legends in their own right.'

The three-month film voyage includes business class flights for two around the world and overnight stays in some of the world's most luxurious hotels, including London's The Savoy, the Four Seasons George V in Paris, Hotel Bel Air in Los Angeles, Gleneagles Hotel in Scotland, and the Mandarin Oriental in Tokyo.

Indiana Jones fans can explore Petra, in Jordan, where Indiana Jones And The Last Crusade was filmed, and relax in the Thai paradise of Ko Phi Phi Leh where Leonardo DiCaprio starred in The Beach.

Vast: Wadi Rum desert in Jordan, the backdrop of the 1962 blockbuster Lawrence of Arabia

Classic: The 1962 film, starring Peter O'Toole and Alec Guiness, won seven Oscars, including best film

Stop! Tourists will be able to rest their hands on the same glass Dustin Hoffman stood behind at the United Methodist Church in LaVerne, California, where the wedding scene from The Graduate (1967) was filmed

Stunning view: One of stop-offs includes a climb up to Machu Picchu in Peru, used during the 2004 biopic about Che Guevara, Motorcycle Diaries

Buyers can also ask 'for what she is having' when they dine at Kat'z Deli in New York where Meg Ryan and Billy Crystal shot the iconic scene from When Harry Met Sally and also get the chance to visit the famous bookshop in Notting Hill, 
London, where Hugh Grant met Julia Roberts in the 1999 romantic comedy.

The movie fanatics will also experience ancient history through a guided tour around China's Forbidden City - the 
setting for The Last Emporer.

Mr Knobil added: 'From prison to deli to jewellery shop, beach or palace - each place on the trip is iconic in its own way.'

The trip covers a staggering nearly 70,000 miles around the world but is very flexible and the London-based travel firm say they help the travellers to work with holiday agents and arrange the most practical routes.

Travellers can tailor the trip to suit their preferences and have the opportunity to spend more or less time in certain locations, if they have a favourite film.

Statues: Buyers will be taken round Rome to see locations from La Dolce Vita, including the Trevi Fountain

Drenched: The iconic monument was the backdrop for a scene in the 1960 film where Anita Ekberg showered herself in the running water

Oriental: The Wudang Monastery in China which was used in Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon

Martial Arts: The film, which was released in 2000, contains epic tree-top combat scenes, stunts and sword fights

Luxury: When the jet-setters reach Paris, they will visit Amelie filming locations in Montmartre and Last Tango in Paris settings around the city before being treated to five nights in the Four Seasons George V Hotel

Amar Thapen, from VeryFirstTo, said:
'We think all the destinations are remarkable on this trip but if you 
forced our hand we would chose the Wudang Monastery as our favourite 
destination.

'It is the
location of stunning cult movie Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon and the 
location is truly exotic and in an absolutely spectacular environment.'

The
'Hollywood Holiday' was created as a blueprint for film fanatics to 
bring their favourite films to life, by visiting the settings they were 
filmed.

As well as 
guided tours of each film setting and location, travellers are able to 
watch a DVD of each movie to refresh their memory along the way.

Prison: Alcatraz Island in San Francisco Bay has been the star of several films - including The Rock (1996), Escape From Alcatraz (1979) and The Enforcer (1976) - which both star Clint Eastwood

Charge: The tourists can try their hand at invading England when they visit Braveheart country in Glencoe, Scotland

Lavish: The trip to Scotland is made more luxurious by a four night stay in the five-star Gleneagles Hotel and Spa

When
travellers fancy something a bit different they experience life in the 
outback and stay in a luxury tent in the wilderness of Australia’s 
Longitude 131, in Uluru-Kata Tjuta National Park.

Mr Thapen added: 'The trip is very flexible and we will
work with the couple to create an itinerary which suits them. If they 
wish to start in a certain country then we can organise that for them.

'We
researched lists of iconic films in stunning locations to create the 
trip, but it can be changed and developed upon if there are certain 
places a couple wishes to see more, or less, of.'

This unique trip is available to purchase for 59 days from Very First To.

The company's previous trips have included a round-the-world wildlife trip, costing £267,000. They
have also offered a worldwide Ultimate Golf Challenge, the Ultimate 
Food Journey (dining at every 3* Michelin restaurant in the world), and 
sold the Ultimate Journey to a couple who visited every World Heritage 
site on the planet.
