A couple have today been banned from keeping animals after showing neglect to two retired greyhounds - one a former champion.

Andrew and Maria Louden, of Plymouth, Devon, failed to feed Tottie and another retired greyhound called Pebbles or treat Tottie's painful sores, Plymouth magistrates heard.

But the couple, who both admitted two charges of causing unnecessary suffering to their dogs Tottie and Pebbles, were spared jail because of their poor health.

Cruel: Andrew, 48, and Maria Louden, 49, almost starved their two pets to death while leaving them flea-ridden and covered in painful sores

Sorry state: Former racing greyhound champion, Bubbly Tottie, was found 
emaciated, flea-ridden and covered in sores after being neglected by his owners

Presiding magistrate Dennis Gavin told the court the dogs were left 'malnourished, underweight and flea-ridden'.

He added: 'Had it not been for your medical conditions, you would be going to prison today.'

The pair were each sentenced to eight weeks in prison, suspended for 12 months.

They must both stick to a curfew at home between 7pm and 7am every night for four months.

Each must pay £200 in costs to the RSPCA.

RSPCA Inspector Sarah Morris, speaking after the case, said it was the worst case of dog cruelty she had seen in 12 years.

She added: 'A life ban from keeping animals is a brilliant result. The dogs were in such a terrible, tragic state. This case will stay with me.'

Julian Jefferson, representing the Loudens, had said both his clients were disabled and on benefits and had found it hard to feed the dogs adequately because their payments had been 'suddenly seized'.

Magistrates heard that both dogs were 'about to die' when Andrew, 48, and Maria, 49, finally took them for treatment.

Neglect: An RSPCA inspector said the treatment Tottie and another greyhound, Pebbles suffered was the worst she had seen in 12 years

Andrew Wyatt, prosecuting for the RSPCA, said the couple took Tottie to a PDSA animal hospital on October 4 last year.

Staff said the dog was emaciated, flea-ridden and had sores on its hind quarters.

Pebbles was also examined by a vet and found to be in a similarly poor state and close to death.

Mr
Wyatt said Tottie, known as ‘Bubbly Tottie’, had previously won the 
greyhound St Leger, a famous competition at Wimbledon Stadium, and once 
changed hands for £50,000.

The Loudens both admitted two charges of causing unnecessary suffering to the dogs.

They today
pleaded guilty at Plymouth Magistrates' Court to failing to adequately feed the pets and get 
veterinary attention for Tottie’s sores between September 20 and October
4 last year.

They also admitted to failing to protect both dogs from pain and suffering in not treating their flea infestations.

Both greyhounds have since made full recoveries and have been happily re-homed.
