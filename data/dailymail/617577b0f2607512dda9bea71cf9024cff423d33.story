Paulo Bento was sacked as Portugal’s coach on Thursday, following a poor World Cup and a dreadful start to the Euro 2016 qualifying campaign, the FPF said on Thursday.

A statement on the Portuguese football association’s website said Bento’s contract had been terminated.

Portugal failed to survive the group stage of the World Cup and were beaten in their opening Euro 2016 qualifying tie at home to Albania on Sunday.

The shock defeat in Aveiro was without their captain and talisman Cristiano Ronaldo, and the next coach should still be able to lift his team out of a qualifying group which also features Serbia, Denmark and Armenia.

Two of the five teams will qualify for France 2016 automatically, while the third-placed side will at the very least get a play-off to reach the tournament.
