A marijuana-smoking mother who left her infant in a car seat on the roof of her car when she drove off, has been sentenced to 16 years of supervised probation.

Catalina Clouser, 21, pleaded guilty to child abuse after police found her five-week-old son abandoned in the middle of an Arizona intersection at about midnight in June 2012. He was alive and unharmed.

The then 19-year-old admitted to police she had smoked pot at a friend's house before driving off, and didn't realize he was on the roof or that he was missing until she got home.

Clouser was sentenced to three months of deferred time in jail, but won't have to serve that time if she successfully completes probation.

According to police, Clouser had 
smoked 'one or two bowls of marijuana' with friends because she was 
upset that her boyfriend had been arrested on DUI charges earlier that day.

The baby was in the boyfriend's 2000 Ford Focus when he was arrested.

When
 Clouser realized her son was missing and retraced her steps, she was 
arrested by Phoenix police who had been called by a passerby who found 
the baby.

'The car seat was damaged. There were scrapes on the car seat, obviously from a fall,' Officer Holmes told KTVK at the time.

'Of
 course initially we thought the baby had been tossed from a car or 
something,' Officer Holmes said, 'but it turns out that that's not the 
case.'

Immediately after the incident, the baby boy was put in the custody of Child Protective Services, but appears to be back in her care.

Clouser was sentenced in the last week by Cynthia Bailey of Maricopa County Superior Court.
