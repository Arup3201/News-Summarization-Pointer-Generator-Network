The ceramic poppies at the Tower of London could crack in cold weather, buyers have been warned.

To date 888,246 poppies have been planted in the Tower's moat to commemorate the 100th anniversary of the First World War - each one representing a fallen British or Commonwealth soldier.

Each poppy was sold for £25 to members of the public by mid-October.

Historic Royal Palaces, who have overseen the incredibly popular memorial, said the poppies have to be removed so they can be sent top buyers by January as promised, despite calls for the installation to remain there longer.

Ceramic poppies at the Tower of London, which have been sold to members of the public for £25. Buyers are being warned not to put them outside until spring because they may crack in extremely cold weather

The installation of over 888,000 red ceramic poppies was created by artist Paul Cummins, each poppy representing a British or colonial fatality during World War One

Now it has emerged that buyers are being warned not to put them outside until spring because they may crack in extremely cold weather, reports the Sunday Times.

Despite a public campaign to make the entire display permanent, a team of 8,000 volunteers will begin dismantling and cleaning the flowers on November 12. 

They will leave two sections, The Wave and The Weeping Window, in place until the end of the month. It will then be displayed across the country in different museums, before being permanently installed at the Imperial War Museum in 2018.   

Floodlights have already been installed to allow people to visit after dusk. It comes after overwhelming crowds forced the closure of the nearby Tower Hill Station, with Transport for London pleading with tourists to postpone their visits. 

The individual poppies have been sold for £25 each to raise money for Armed Forces charities. The tour of sections of the artwork will be funded with charitable donations as well as £500,000 from the Government. 

The Camerons are among millions of people to have visited the site since it was unveiled by Paul Cummins earlier this year

Politicians pleaded with organisers to keep Blood Swept Lands and Seas of Red at the Tower of London permanently following the site's popularity. 

An estimated 4million people will have viewed the attraction by November 12, prompting an online campaign with more than 20,000 signatures to stop it being dismantled. 

Adding his weight to the calls, Labour leader Ed Miliband said: ‘I hope that a way can be found to extend this remarkable exhibition, and ensure that many more members of the public get the chance to pay their own personal tributes and see this extraordinary sight.’ 

London Mayor Boris Johnson is also reportedly in favour of keeping the artwork at the Tower. 

The politician told the Evening Standard this week: 'I’m keen to explore whether we can keep the exhibition open for longer, to give as many people as possible the chance to glimpse something so incredible, whilst easing the pressure on numbers.'

Lib Dem leader Nick Clegg, who has not yet visited the attraction, told radio listeners: 'It's really struck a chord, it's extraordinary and very moving to see. 

'Let’s maybe keep the display going a bit longer, but not deprive those charities of that much needed money from the sale of the poppies.' 

Also planting poppies were Chelsea Pensioner Albert Willis, 79, an ex Grenadier Guard alongside a Tower of London Yeoman Warder and a serving Grenadier Guard 

Sections of the artwork such as The Wave (pictured) will remain at the Tower of London until the end of the month to allow more visitors

The Weeping Window, a section of the piece with flowers pouring out of one of the tower's historic windows, will remain until December

The poignant tribute is among many pieces of artwork produced to commemorate the 100th anniversary of the beginning of WWI

Floodlights have been installed to allow more people to visit after dusk after overwhelming crowds closed the nearby tube station 

The Queen and Prince Phillip visited the artwork in October. Volunteers have been adding to the piece since it was unveiled in August
