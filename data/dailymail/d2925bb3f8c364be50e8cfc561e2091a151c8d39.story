West Ham were made to feel right at home in Auckland as hundreds turned out to watch Sam Allardyce put his side through their paces at the first open training session in New Zealand.

The global reach of the Premier League was clear at North Harbour Stadium as fans lined up to catch a glimpse of the top-flight players in action.

The star attraction was of course Winston Reid, the Hammers defender who was born just a few miles from their training ground in Auckland's North Shore, as they prepare to face the A-League's Wellington Phoenix on Wednesday at Eden Park.

Reid was 
all smiles as he signed autographs for fans who will have a rare chance 
to see their All Whites captain live when West Ham face Wellington Phoenix on Wednesday.

They then head south to take on Sydney FC in Wellington on Saturday in a 2pm kick-off.

While
 the session was punctuated with plenty of laughter from what appears an
 upbeat squad, there was a scare for winger Matt Jarvis, who went down 
with leg injury.

Striker
 Carlton Cole proved hugely popular with young players from the Milford 
Football Club, who were treated to a session of their own with a number 
of the players.

Supporters at the ground hailed from all over the world, a display of both Auckland's cosmopolitan population and the willingness of fans to go to the other side of the world for their team - the faithful delivered a stirring version of I'm Forever Blowing Bubbles.

Among their number was Gerald Smith, the Auckland-based great, great, great grandson of West Ham's founder Arnold Hills.

'My mother's mother was a Hills and her grandfather was Arnold Hills, the founder of the Club and also the founder of the Thames Ironworks,' Smith told Whufc.com. 'I'm definitely a fan because of my family links, but Wednesday will be the first time I've actually been to a West Ham game.'

Newcastle United are also in New Zealand for matches against Sydney FC on Tuesday in Dunedin and the Phoenix on Saturday in Wellington.
