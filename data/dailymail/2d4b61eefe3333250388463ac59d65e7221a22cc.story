A baby girl found naked, lying in her own excrement, and close to death in a car boot may have been hidden there since her birth almost two years ago, a court in France has heard.

The baby's Portuguese parents face up to ten years in jail for the alleged neglect of the child, who was only found in the car when the mother took the vehicle to a garage in Terrason, central France.

The unemployed couple live in Brignac-La-Plaine in the Correze department in France.

The baby, thought to be aged between 15 and 23 months, was found by mechanics when they heard 'strange noises that sounded like moans' coming from the woman's car boot. 

Neglect charges: The parents of a baby girl found close to death in the boot of her mother's car in France are escorted to court, where prosecutors told how car mechanics made the gruesome discovery

Prosecutor Jean-Pierre Laffite said yesterday that it 'defied imagination' that the baby was forced to live in the car boot undetected after the 45-year-old mother woman kept the baby's existence a secret, even from her husband.

Mr Laffite said the baby’s condition had stabilised but that she was ‘seriously retarded’.

Garage workers were only made aware of the little girl when they heard noises coming from the boot of the mother’s Peugeot 307, according to The Telegraph. Insisting on opening the boot despite the woman's protests they were horrified with what they found.

Guillaume Iguacel, one of the mechanics who made the horrible discovery, said: ‘I’m still having trouble 
sleeping.

'It was a horrifying sight, seeing this little girl in her own 
excrement, not able to hold up her head, white as a sheet.’

Mechanic's shock: The baby - found in her own excrement in the foul-smelling boot after mechanics heard 'strange noises that sounded like moans' - is thought to have been hidden there from birth

The Portuguese couple faces charges relating to depriving the child of care and food, inflicting 
habitual voluntary violence on a child under 15-years-old, and concealing a child's existence.

Prosecutors said last night that the woman’s claim that the baby’s father, a 40-year-old unemployed builder, was unaware of the baby’s existence was ‘one of several points being checked out by investigators’.

The couple were released under strict bail conditions and their names have not been released to protect the identity of their three other children, a girl aged four and two boys, nine and ten. The children are currently being cared for by Correze social workers. The couple are prohibited from entering their house pending further investigations by police.

Hid baby's existence: Neighbours of the baby's parents, from French village Birgnac-la-Plaine (pictured), were shocked to learn the shocking news, one saying 'there was never any trace of a baby'

Firemen
who spoke to La Montagne newspaper said that the baby's life ‘was at stake 
within a time frame of 15 minutes’ when she was discovered.

A juvenile judge will make a ruling in 
the next few days on the future of the couple’s four children and 
whether the two eldest, the boys, can be returned to their parents.

Neighbours of the couple were incredulous at news of the discovery.

One villager said: ‘They are people like any others and not dirty. 

‘I went to their house several times and there was never any trace of a baby.

'I’m still having trouble 
sleeping... It was a horrifying sight, seeing this little girl in her own 
excrement, not able to hold up her head, white as a sheet' 

- Guillaume Iguacel, mechanic who found the baby girl

‘We never noticed that she was pregnant.’

Another neighbour, Pascale, told Le Parisien: ‘We had the impression that this woman lived in her car. She never left it.

‘I recall seeing her several times a week with her car parked in a little lot about 200 metres from her house but we couldn’t see what she was doing in the boot. 

‘We never heard a single cry, never saw a bottle or a pushchair.’

The couple’s three other children had attended the local school and appeared normal. 

According to Sud Ouest newspaper, it was said that the mother had given birth to the baby in a corridor at the couple’s house aided by a neighbour.

The man was allegedly drunk when he was 
arrested on Friday night and could only be questioned on Saturday after 
spending a night in a cell to sober up.
