For many New Yorkers, it’s hard not to worry about the rent being too damn high.

But in the world of high-stakes Manhattan real estate, money is no object. In fact, it can be a point of pride and a show of seemingly-unlimited affluence, which could help explain the sky-high prices. 

The top three properties – located in Midtown West, Lenox Hill,and Lincoln Square – boast creature comforts and space that many can only dream of, and are listed between $95million and $100million, making them the priciest residential listings in the city.

Priciest: The 18th floor of the Sherry-Netherland, at 781 Fifth Avenue in the Lenox Hill neighborhood of Manhattan is one of the most expensive listings at $95m

Location: The 18th floor co-op is located at the southwest tip of the Lennox Hill neighbourhood, a block away from landmarks like the Plaza Hotel, Grand Army Plaza, and Central Park

Amenities: The Sherry-Netherland co-op offers 7,000 square feet, complete with seven bedrooms and seven baths

Luxe: Along with a massive terrace, the property has four exposures, an almost unheard of thing in Manhattan real estate

The first property, the 18th floor of the Sherry-Netherland, is listed with Kathy Sloane of Brown Harris Stevens and Dolly Lenz of Prudential Douglas Elliman. 

The 18th floor co-op is located at the southwest tip of the Lennox Hill neighbourhood, a block away from several Manhattan landmarks – including the Plaza Hotel, Grand Army Plaza, and Central Park.

It offers 7,000 square feet, complete with seven bedrooms and seven baths, dizzying views of the Plaza Hotel and Central Park, and three separate entrances. The property, which has wrap-around terraces, has been on the market since September.

Despite the colossal price tag, its monthly real estate tax is incredibly affordable, at only $1 per month.

High living: The 18th floor of the Sherry-Netherland, a co-op residential hotel across from the Plaza, is selling for a staggering $95million

Austere: A copper gargoyle adorns the building, which overlooks the southeast end of Central Park

Old school: The lobby reflects the glamorous old New York set, with attended elevators and marble details

Aside from its expansive space, the Fifth Avenue property boasts services associated with old New York, including valets in white gloves, turn-down service, maid service, 24-hour concierge, and in-room dining from Harry Cipriani.

It was designed in 1927 by the same architecture firm that created The Waldorf-Astoria and The Pierre; its 165 apartments were converted to co-ops in 1954.

A property at 15 Central Park West was also listed for $95million, and the sweeping French Gothic Woolworth Mansion was listed for $90million. 

The most expensive listing of the year goes to the penthouse at  150 W. 56th St. in the CitySpire condominium which was previously owned by Long Island real estate developer Steven Klar.

He listed the property in July of this year.

Trophy: 150 West 56th Street, the CitySpire building, boasts the most expensive listing; its penthouse suite costs $100million, but also has top-of-the-line equipment and 360-degree views

Greco-Roman: The elaborate penthouse was designed by Juan Pablo Molyneux, and takes much inspiration from Greek and Roman architecture

Vistas: The penthouse occupys the top three floors of the CitySpire building; its dining room sits 20 and overlooks the Hudson River

Lavish living: The three-story penthouse has an entire guest apartment and lots of terrace space

The octagonally-shaped property boasts 8,000 square feet and three floors – one of which is an entire guest suite. 

Mr Klar told the New York Times in a July interview that he purchased the property in 1993 for $4.5million and spent years redesigning the raw interior. 

He transformed it to hold a 20-person dining room, six bedrooms, nine baths, complete with wine cellar and media room. It has 135 windows, which look out to four separate exposures.

But Forbes notes that the property does not have other typically-essential high-end features like high ceilings.

Contender: Apartment #35S of 15 Central Park West is also listed for a staggering $95million

Views: The apartment is located at the southwest corner of Central Park and offers stunning views of the city

Expansive: Located in Lincoln Square, the a five-bedroom, five-and-a-half bath condominium is also listed for $95million

In addition, the new construction, One57, the property being constructed blocks away, could seriously block some of the views. 

The third listing, also for $95,000,000, is at 15 Central Park West, a five-bedroom, five-and-a-half bath condominium in Lincoln Square.

The property has three exposures, library, massive living room, and views of both Central Park and the Hudson River. 

The most recent condo sold at the property was a three-bedroom, three-and-a-half bath condo for $24million.
