Max Clifford has been arrested in connection with allegations of sexual offences by detectives from Operation Yewtree, it has been reported

Disgraced PR guru Max Clifford has been arrested in connection with allegations of sexual offences by detectives from Operation Yewtree, it has been reported.

Scotland Yard said a 71-year-old had been questioned at a police station in Peterborough.

Clifford, 71, was jailed for eight years last May after being convicted of a string of indecent assaults, carried out between 1977 and 1984, using his celebrity connections to lure women.

He is currently serving his sentence at Littlehey Prison in Cambridgeshire, which is not far from Peterborough.

The former celebrity agent, who branded his accusers 'fantasists', denied the charges, but was convicted at London's Southwark Crown Court.

It is understood that today's arrest relates to a number of separate allegations of sex offences. 

Following Clifford's sentencing last year, Scotland Yard confirmed that other people had come forward with allegations. 

Police have not named the individual who was arrested today, but did say that the man was 'not new' to the Operation Yewtree investigation.

Clifford was named on Twitter by Mark Williams-Thomas, the man who exposed Jimmy Savile's crimes in an award-winning ITV investigation. 

He posted: 'Max Clifford (71) arrested today re allegations of sexual offences,He was interviewed at a police station in Peterborough. #OP.Yewtree'.

Minutes later, he added: 'As previously stated today's arrest of Max Clifford relates to number of separate allegations of sex offences that CPS have been advising on.'

Mr Williams-Thomas, a former police officer who specialised in child protection and major crime, was the first person to expose Savile.

Operation Yewtree is the police probe set up in the wake of disclosures that former BBC DJ Jimmy Savile was a prolific paedophile.

The investigation has three strands of inquiry. One relates to Savile's crimes and the second relates to allegations against Savile and others.

The third strand, under which Clifford is understood to have been questioned, concentrates on accusations unconnected to the Savile investigations but which emerged as a result of the publicity surrounding the late DJ. 

A Scotland Yard spokesman said it has spoken to 17 people as part of the Yewtree investigation.

He said: 'This is not a new individual to Operation Yewtree. This is not an 18th individual.' Inquiries continue, he added.

Last month, Gary Glitter, who was the first person to be arrested under Operation Yewtree, became the fourth high-profile figure to be convicted under  the investigation.

Former Radio 1 DJ Dave Lee Travis and children's entertainer Rolf Harris have also been found guilty of historic sexual offences.
