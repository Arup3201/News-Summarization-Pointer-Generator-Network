He's come a long way since he left Liverpool to find fame and fortune on The X Factor and it was emphasised even more when he returned to the city just days before the live final on Wednesday.

Marcus Collins was given the star treatment making a grand entrance at his old school in a helicopter and greeted by screaming fans.

And later in the day the singer's mentor, Gary Barlow, popped round to meet the family and have an obligatory cup of tea.

Gary, who is head judge on the show, was mobbed when he arrived and had to be escorted through the large crowd that had gathered outside the Collins family home.

He was greeted at the front door by his proud contestant, who embraced the Take That star before inviting him in to meet the rest of his clan.

Earlier in the day children at Sacred 
Heart in Crosby were stunned when Marcus was flown in and promptly took 
to the stage in the school hall.

According to those present when Marcus landed at the school, he spent quite some time signing autographs for the local fans – many of whom had their own Marcus masks.

Even a special X-Factor cake had been made in honour of his return to the North West.

Although he has been the favourite throughout the series, Marcus’s odds have dropped lower than Amelia Lily Oliver’s, with Little Mix tipped to take the prize.

Dressed in typically flamboyant style with red trousers, a white shirt and matching red bow tie, Marcus performed to perfection for the gawping audience.

And rather than seeming overwhelmed by the response, Marcus lapped up his new-found celebrity status.

Clearly trying to garner a last minute boost, the singer, who is mentored by Gary Barlow in the show, sang a set of tracks while a cardboard cut-out with the words 'Vote Marcus' decorated the stage.

One vote he might be getting is that of the Duchess of Cambridge.

Marcus met with Kate and her husband, Prince William, on Tuesday night when the Royal couple attended Gary's solo gig at the Royal Albert Hall.

Kate admitted to the Liverpudlian that her and William are both big fans of the ITV show and will be tuning in this weekend.

'They both said they watched the X Factor. How amazing is that?' Marcus said.

'They asked if I was nervous about 
the weekend and I said I couldn’t wait. Kate said she was amazed at how 
much stronger my vocals were live than on television. I just can’t 
believe it.'

However, Marcus was put on vocal rest earlier this week as he battled a throat infection and had to cancel his guest appearance on stage with Gary at the Prince's Trust concert.

All three finalists, including teenager Amelia Lily and girl group Little Mix, also appeared on Chris Moyles' Radio 1 breakfast show at the start of the week, but Marcus was unable to speak much throughout the interview as he continues to prepare for the showdown this weekend.

But he appears to be back to his best, belting out songs as the excitement took over in Merseyside.

Former work: Before Marcus found fame he worked at a hairdressers in Liverpool

The star extended his homecoming tour by then travelling to his old work place, Jonathan James Hairdressers, in the city.

A crowd gathered around the shop as he showed his face in the window and beamed for the waiting devotees.

He also performed an impromptu song for customers and workers in the salon, grabbing a hairbrush and giving his vocals a good workout.

Clearly excited to be back in town Marcus wrote on Twitter ahead of his arrival: 'Liverpool I'm homeeeee... Can't wait to see you all ??? you don't need wristbands to attend xxx Marcus masks at the ready xx'

And he wasn't the only finalist to have jetted in to their home towns to garner last minute support.

Controversial 'comeback kid' Amelia Lily put claims of a fix surrounding the star behind her as she returned to her home town of Middlesbrough.

School show: Amelia also took to the mic at her old school for screaming fans, despite receiving flack for supposed fixing behind the scenes

Dressed in a tight black dress with a 
pink faux fur coat to match her pale pink hair, Amelia looked delighted 
as she caught up with her former classmates at Teesside High School and 
treated them to a quick performance in the school hall.

More rumours emerged yesterday that The X Factor is a fix after Amelia's 'winner's single' was made available for pre-order on HMV's website.

While all three finalists have 
pre-recorded their single to go on sale immediately after the winner is 
announced this weekend, only Amelia's appeared on the website.

An immediate Twitter storm ensued, causing the HMV site to crash as curious fans flooded the website to see for themselves.

However, HMV
spokesperson Gennaro Castaldo said: 'Hmv.com was looking to accept 
customer pre-orders for versions of the X Factor winner’s single 
recorded by each of the three finalists.

'However,
due to a technical issue only Amelia Lily’s details were uploaded.'

While Amelia shrugged off the media storm for her gig on Wednesday, four-piece Little Mix headed to Jesy Nelson's hometown of Romford, Essex for a signing earlier in the week.

Looking overwhelmed by their hysterical reception, Tulisa Contostavlos' girls were met with hordes of screaming fans at the city's Liberty Centre and Nelson's old school.

Extra police were reportedly called to the event after thousands of people swamped the venue.

But the quartet were delighted with the turnout, telling their 270,000 followers on Twitter: 'Just visited 
@leighannpinnock old sec school..

'The support there was UNREAL =D loved 
it! Now en route to liberty 1 in Romford for best! :-D

'Sooo many people turned up we can't believe it!!!xxxx :)'
