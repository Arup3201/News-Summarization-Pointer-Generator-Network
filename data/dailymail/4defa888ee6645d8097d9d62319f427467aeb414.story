Most of us have an old PC lying around, which, until now, may be destined for the scrap heap.

But as Nvidia's Ben Berraondo explains, for a modest sum, this humble unit can be turned into a powerful games machine - making it a very affordable alternative to aging mainstream consoles.

'You don’t need a Gruffalo-esque PC to enjoy games looking their best,' he says.

Stunning: Graphics on consoles are limited to their hardware, but PCs offer sharper images with heaps more detail and longer draw distances

'In fact, more often than not, it can take just one small upgrade to your old family PC and bring Full High Definition PC gaming goodness to your home. That upgrade is the graphics card.'

One big advantage on playing games on PC is that games will have much better graphics. Advancements in graphics card technology means where console graphics are limited to their hardware, PC graphics have continued to improve.

Assassin's Creed 3, for example runs on Direct X 11 - resulting in anti-aliasing technology, higher-resolution textures and draw distances.

The beauty is in the detail: This screenshot shows how anti-aliasing works on an image. Notice the jagged lines of the first picture. In the second, multi-sample anti-aliasing is used, improving image quality. The third shows temporal anti-aliasing, developed to give 'movie-style' quality to images

Anti-aliasing removes jagged lines, and helps smooth edges, while Tessellation allows for environments and objects to have greater surface detail.

Thankfully, changing the graphics card is remarkably easy.

'Simply slide off the PC side-cover (many don’t even have screws nowadays) and find your PCI-E slot - don’t worry about the name, it’s either going to be empty or have a graphics card already in there,' explains Ben.

'Take the old card out (if one is already in there), plug in your shiny new card, close up your PC, turn it on and point your web browser to www.GeForce.co.uk.

Looking their best: For those considering an aging current gen console, likely to be replaced by newer models next year, an upgraded PC may be a better investment

NVIDIA will even help you automatically find your right drivers (these are what makes the graphics work) and then you’re all set and ready to ‘press start’!

Graphics cards range in price and performance and can work out a lot cheaper than a buying a mainstream console.

'As a minimum I’d go for around £100 which will get you an NVIDIA GeForce GTX 650 Ti, taking you to another level if you’re used to an Xbox 360 or a PS3,' says Ben.

'Going a bit further up to £160 will get you a GeForce GTX 660 which will enable you to ramp up all the settings to "high" to get even better visuals.'

'Finally, if you can stretch to £230, you’ll be able to get a GeForce GTX 660 Ti – this means silky smooth games at over "1080P" – full HD resolution.

'if you’ve bought your PC in the past 3 or 4 years then you should be ready to go.'

Sound investment: Even with a £100 graphics card, you'll notice a much cleaner, sharper image

There are other graphics cards from other developers available, too. AMD, another giant in the graphics market, have their Radeon series, with the 6450, 6570 and 6670.

Prices vary depending on performance, although most now support Direct X 11.

A Radeon HD 5850 may be a slightly older card (and does not support Direct X 11), but still delivers strong graphics in games such as Crysis - a title renowned for setting the bench mark for visuals.

Coming in at just over £100, this is a viable alternative.

There may be some other factors to consider, too. If your PC is older, then you may need to upgrade the power supply, motherboard and cooling system to deal with the new graphics card.

While, given the fact that PCs are capable of displaying images at varying resolutions, a monitor upgrade may be needed if you're to get optimum visual quality.

Lastly, RAM (or random access memory) is used to store the game's information, with many games stating a minimum amount. More RAM can be added, and you'll likely see an increase in performance.

Given that current gen console successors are likely to be announced later next year, a PC upgrade could be a sound investment.

However, if your PC is too old, buying a new one may still work out cheaper in the long run. Although it will be slightly more expensive than buying a console this Christmas, it's likely to 'future-proof' your hardware to deal with the demanding 2013 games line-up - proving cheaper than shelling out for both existing and future consoles.
