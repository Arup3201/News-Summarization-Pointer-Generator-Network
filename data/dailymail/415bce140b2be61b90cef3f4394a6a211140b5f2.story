An extreme sports fan decided to propose to his girlfriend mid-way through a parachute jump but ended up fumbling the ring while she watched in horror as it tumbled uncontrollably to earth.

Brandon Strohbehn and his girlfriend Nicole Nepomuceno used a special type of tandem jump where they face each other as they leaped from the aircraft while12,500ft above California.

Nicole wrapped her legs around the firefighter's waist and strapped herself to his harness before exiting the plane.

Nicole Nepomuceno smiles as her boyfriend Bandon Stohbehn produces an engagement ring as he proposes mid-way through a 12,500ft parachute drop

Brandon turns the ring towards his girlfriend Nicole so she could get a better look while floating down to earth

Nicole's joy is short-lived when the ring gets caught in the slip stream and is ripped from Brandon's grasp

On the way down, Brandon, from Oceanside, California, pulled a ring from his jump suit's pocket, opening the box so his girlfriend could inspect it.

As he was about to hand over the ring, it 'slipped' from his grasp and plunged to earth.

Brandon filmed the jump from a special helmet mounted camera and caught his girlfriend's reaction as she saw the ring float for a second in mid air before tumbling out of control.

Before the jump, Mr Strohbehn arranged with members of the two families to hide around the landing zone with the genuine ring.

He said: 
'The original plan was to do it out of a hot air balloon. I had a bunch 
of friends helping with the coordination and helping to keep Nicole from
 knowing what was going on.

'We
 actually had planned it as a going away jump for a friend that was 
heading to North Dakota - it was the perfect cover, Nicole had no idea.

'The
 balloon jump got canceled multiple times due to weather so I was fed 
up. I wasn't gonna let another weather hold keep me from asking her to 
marry me.'

He said: 'So, two months after the 
original planned balloon jump, we had a "birthday boogie" for Nicole's 
birthday at Skydive San Diego.

'Our plan was to jump the whole weekend and camp down there. So I decided this would be the perfect time to make this happen.

'Maybe even a good birthday present. So we came up with the Mr. Bill plan.

'I got a 
fake ring, knowing that I was going to drop it on our Mr. Bill high pull
 at 12,500ft. Then I called all her family and coordinated - with the 
help of her brother-in-law and my brother - them to come down on the day
 I was going to propose.

'We
 even had a special staging area in one of the classrooms that my 
brother would escort them to so Nicole wouldn't see any of her family 
there and get suspicious.

'Then,
 once we got on the plane that was taking us up for our proposal jump, 
my brother had all of her family and my family come out and wait for us 
to land.

'She
 was super surprised and couldn't believe all her family was there. In 
the end, it ended up being a great thing that the balloon jumps were 
canceled because it gave us a chance to have all of our family there to 
celebrate with us for this epic day.'

Once safely on the ground, Brandon produces the real engagement ring as he bends down on one knee

Luckily this time there was no mistake as Nicole agrees to marry Brandon despite the high altitude prank

The couple now have 224 skydives each under their belts, although they almost failed to get together in the first place.

Friends insisted that the pair were a perfect match, but they resisted all attempts to be set up on a blind date.

Brandon
 added: 'Neither of us wanted to be set up on a blind date, so when we 
first met at a country bar just by chance, I think we both wanted to 
make sure that it was clear we were not interested in what our friends 
were trying to force us into.

'But,
 as it turns out, we were both attracted to each other but didn't want 
to admit it yet. It didn't take too long after for us to start "running 
into each other" more often.

'Our first unofficial first date was snowboarding up at Big Bear - a local mountain in San Bernardino.

'We
 were just going "as friends", so it was by no means a "real" date, but 
we both knew what it was. Not too long after, we started officially 
dating.'

After dropping the ring, Brandon unfurled a banner asking Nicole to marry him as they continued their descent

Once on the ground, Brandon and Nicole showed off the banner containing the proposal
