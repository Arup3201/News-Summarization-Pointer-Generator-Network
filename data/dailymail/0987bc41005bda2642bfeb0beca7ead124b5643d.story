The owner of an animal centre set up in memory of her murdered grandparents has avoided jail despite being found guilty of cruelty to the pets she rescued.

Dying or dead animals were found around the sanctuary run by 27-year-old Lindsay Newell in Etwall, Derbyshire, while others were sick or malnourished and emaciated.

The veterinary nurse devoted all her spare time and money to the centre, but ‘took her eye off the ball’ and the animals suffered as a result, Stafford Magistrates’ Court heard.

Conditional discharge: Lindsay Newell is approached by an RSPCA officer at her house in Staffordshire

Guilty of cruelty: One of Newell's animals, a pig named 'Babe' (pictured), who made headlines two years ago after being saved from a squalid council house, died as RSPCA officers raided the centre following a tip-off

One of them, a pig named ‘Babe’, who was featured in MailOnline in March 2012 after being saved from a squalid council house, died as RSPCA officers raided the centre following a tip-off.

A trial was told Newell’s claims that she ‘didn’t notice anything wrong’ were simply ‘incredible’.

Yesterday
 at Burton-upon-Trent Magistrates’ Court, she was banned from keeping 
animals after being found guilty of six counts of cruelty and handed a 
two-year conditional discharge.

But
 she was cleared of a further 25 charges that she failed to feed the 
animals properly after the judge decided she had done her best to feed 
the animals in her care.

Today
 the RSPCA, which itself took sick and injured animals to the centre, 
was left counting the £20,000 cost of a prosecution against a woman a 
judge admitted had only ‘a desire to help.’

The
 organisation charged Newell after swooping on the Burton Wildlife and 
Animal Rescue Centre in Etwall, along with police and trading standards 
officials.

They also raided Newell’s home in 
nearby Stapenhill as part of a county-wide operation called Operation 
Mako, set up to tackle rural crime.

She had opened the centre in her own back
 garden in March 2008 in memory of her grandparents, who were killed by 
their nephew Richard Barlow, 29.

'Her evidence that she didn’t notice anything wrong is incredible. The responsible owner would have noticed'

Dingleby Clark, prosecuting

He battered Bill Barlow, 78, and his 65 year-old wife to death in 2007 during a violent row over land.

Their
 granddaughter Newell said their love of animals and the countryside 
inspired her. She wept as she told the judge how she cared for her 
animals.

She told the court 
her salary went towards running the sanctuary - which cost £2,000 in 
rent a year - and up to £400 a week on straw and animal food.

But
 the prosecution painted a very different picture, accusing her of 
causing unnecessary suffering by not giving the animals enough food and 
failing to seek veterinary help for them.

Police and RSPCA officers raided the centre in November 2012 after members of the public raised concerns.

'Seriously undernourished': Babe was filmed at the centre in Derbyshire in a shocking state. It was the second time the pig had been found in squalor, having been rescued from that situation in Derby in March 2012

Muddy water: The Gloucestershire old spot pig had been rescued from a council house in Derby in 2012. Video footage of the dying animal's final moments was among the evidence shown during the five-day trial

Among the animals was ‘Babe’ the pig, who was lying in muddy water in a paddock ‘seriously undernourished’. The Gloucestershire old spot pig had been rescued from a council house in Derby in March 2012.

Video footage of the dying animal’s final moments was among the evidence shown at Stafford Magistrates’ Court during the five-day trial.

'These were not deliberate or intentional acts. They were a consequence of you trying to do too much'

District Judge David Taylor

Dingleby Clark, prosecuting, said the pig was one of a large number of animals found to be suffering.

He said: ‘This pig was being looked after by the defendant, but for some reason she did not give the required care to this pig and it died.’

Newell was accused of causing suffering to turkeys, cockerels, sheep, a Canada goose, horses, ponies and piglets.

Mr Clark added: ‘She had too many animals and too few staff. She had too many different species.’

He said that at some point in 2012, Newell started a new job and moved away after which she ‘had completely taken her eye off the ball’.

The centre was ‘out of control’, with animals suffering and dying, he said. Inspectors also found the carcass of a lamb, which had starved to death, in a field.

Sarah Levy volunteered at the centre for six months until around June 2012. When she left she wrote a letter to the RSPCA expressing her concerns about the standard of care for the animals.

RSPCA deputy chief inspector Jayne Bashford said there was very little grazing area for the animals and distinctly remembered no water being available. She ran her hands over animals and could feel their spines and ribs.

Newell refused to comment in police interviews. She replied with ‘no comment’ to all questions during a 44-minute interview in December 2012.

She told the court had been ‘intimidated’ and ‘shocked’ when the centre was raided.

Giving evidence Newell said she would take animals home with her from a vet’s practice where she used to work so they were not put down. She took in wildlife and poultry that other centres turned away.

She moved the sanctuary to Etwall in 2011 and said the RSPCA was among those that would take animals to the centre.

‘Rescuing is the main part of what we do, so if an animal is trapped down a drain or an animal has been shot, or on ice, or a fox is trapped in a fences we would rescue them,’ she said.

‘It’s things that normal members of the public can’t deal with.’

She told the court in June 2012 she started working on a farm at a school in Ashby-de-la-Zouch, Leicestershire, for autistic children.

But Mr Clark said Newell should have checked the animals more often. He said: ‘Her evidence that she didn’t notice anything wrong is incredible. The responsible owner would have noticed.’

Newell has now been made redundant from her job, but still runs the centre, where she had 300 animals.

Nigel Weller, defending, said his client now wanted to dedicate her life to running the sanctuary.

'She had too many animals and too few staff. She had too many different species'

Dingleby Clark, prosecuting

The RSPCA said it cost £20,000 to investigate the case and bring Newell to court, of which she will have to pay just £2,000.

District Judge David Taylor found her guilty of causing unnecessary suffering to a pig, a pony, a goat and sheep.

He gave Newell a two-year conditional discharge and disqualified her from keeping sheep, goats, pigs and equine animals for five years.

Passing sentence, he said: ‘These were not deliberate or intentional acts. They were a consequence of you trying to do too much. Your attempts to help the animals caused you to get into this mess.’
