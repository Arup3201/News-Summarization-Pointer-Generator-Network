Growing numbers of women are being spied on by hackers who access their webcams then take secret pictures and post them on 'sex slave' forums.

The hackers - known as Rats - infect the device with a remote administration tool (RAT) that opens up the woman's screen, webcam, files and microphone.

These women can then be monitored in secret or taunted by the hacker who sends mocking messages and pictures into her computer. 

Concerning: Hackers now able to spy on women by taking control of their computers and watching them through their webcams

The phenomenon is not new but has now reached giant proportions with tech site Arstechnica revealing that one of the 'slave forums' has 23 million total posts.

One user wrote: 'Poor people think they are alone in their private homes, but have no idea they are the laughing stock on HackForums.'

'It would be funny if one of these slaves venture into learning how to hack and comes across this thread,' he continued.

The scheme works by fooling the victim into downloading a small piece of software onto their machine.

This can be done by sending them an email asking them to click to see a picture or listen to a song, for example.

Once
 installed, the RAT software allows the hacker to take control of the machine at any
 time - rather like the system some big firms use to update their 
machine's software and fix IT problems.

Hackers can control the machine as if they
 were sitting at it - doing everything from switching on the webcam to 
looking through files on the hard drive to find bank details and personal pictures.

To avoid becoming infected, experts say you should:

The most at risk computers are those running older software which has not been updated, and those without up to date anti-virus software installed.

One of the biggest problems ratters face
 is the webcam lights which indicate when the camera is in use and alert
 the previously unaware 'slaves.'

'Unfortunately she asked her boyfriend 
why the light on her cam kept coming on,' one RAT controller wrote.

'And
 he knew, she never came back :)'

Entire
 threads have been devoted to bypassing the lights - lists have been compiled 
of webcams which do not have lights, as well as hackers sending fake 
messages saying that camera software is being updated to explain the 
flashing.

There are even books which help hackers learn how to get into victims' computers.

Hackers do not always target women - some of them are just interested in any voyeurism and revel in delving into users' lives both males and female.

They even run alternate lists and compile photos of less attractive people they are spying on.

Spying on their victims can have a 
haunting effect - Arstechnica reported that one student who was targeted did not leave her dorm room for a week after her laptop 
was bugged and she was taunted with private information.

But some hackers fail to see they are invading people's privacy with their game.

Control: Using a RAT to scare a victim is another favourite of the hackers - as well as taking content they can flash content up on the screen of the machine they have accessed

The victim is first fooled into downloading a small piece of software onto their machine.

This can be done by sending them an email asking them to click to see a picture or listen to a song, for instance.

Once installed, this allows the hacker to take control of the machine at any time - rather like the system some big firms use to update their machine's software and fix IT problems.

Once installed the software allows hackers to control the machine as if they were sitting at it - doing everything from switching on the webcam to looking through files on the hard drive.

One
 hacker wrote online: 'For me I don't have the feeling of doing 
something perverted, it's more or less a game, cat and mouse game, with 
all the bonuses included.

'The weirdest thing is, when I see the person you've been spying on in 
real life, I've had that a couple of times, it just makes me giggle, 
especially if it's someone with an uber-weird-nasty habit.'

Vicky Woollaston from Web User 
magazine explains: 'A hacker can sometimes get access to someone’s 
computer by infecting it with malware – this can include the victim 
clicking on an infected link, opening an infected attachment on an 
email, downloading a malicious file/game/software on to their computer.

'The malware/Trojan horse goes into the PC and opens it up so the hacker can access your PC remotely.

'Once
 a hacker has access to your PC it can access all your files, change 
settings on your PC and access what is being shown on your webcam for 
example.'

RATs are difficult to halt - too many exist, many of them are technically legal, and the source code for the software is plastered across the internet, but there are many precautions users can take such as using a solid anti-malware program, keeping the operating system updated, and not visiting dodgy sites or downloading suspicious content.
