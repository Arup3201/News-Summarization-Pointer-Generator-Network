The Crysis games have always been known for their graphics and Crysis 3 is no different.

Developed on the CryENGINE 3, Crysis 3 is visually stunning on the aging consoles, drawing every last drop of power from them. And thankfully, the beautiful settings and slick combat system are just about enough to distract gamers from the somewhat average storyline.

Welcome to the jungle: Most of the levels look similar to the movie I Am Legend. Look closely enough, and you'll even see different animals running around

Crysis 3 takes place 20 years after Crysis 2. New York City has become an overgrown wasteland where nature has taken over. Dilapidated skyscrapers litter the land and dense foliage covers what is left of roads and pavements.

Players take on the role of Prophet who wants retribution from the CELL Corporation. Whilst clinging to the remnants of his humanity he is flanked by his sidekick ‘Psycho’ who has been stripped of his Nanosuit and is struggling to adapt to his new found vulnerability.

Their story is engaging if a little predictable in parts, and voice-acting is done well bar the few occasions where lips move to a different voice-over channel. 

Combat is slick and dynamic. Crysis 3 introduces the Tactical Bow to Prophet’s armoury alongside his Nanosuit. This lets you take out targets from a distance while staying cloaked.

Fights are often carried out from far away with your tactical visor being used to tag enemies and objects of interest. Simply holding the visor's targeting reticule over an enemy brings up a host of information - from what weapons they are carrying, to the armour they are wearing.

Different arrow types are readily available and easy to interchange. These range from explosive tips, useful to wipe out groups of grunts, to those that deliver a lethal electric shock - perfect for enemies unlucky enough to be wading through water.

Similar to the earlier games, the Nanosuit allows you to cloak and engage an armour enhancement, both of which are subject to your energy bar that depletes the more intense your movements. There's no ability to activate 'Speed Mode' or 'Strength Mode' this time around, though.

Still, combat remains very tactical. Enemies can be stealthily taken out, tight corners can be escaped, alien CEPH scared by de-cloaking right in front of them or you can run in wielding an impressive array of guns and alien weaponry.

As players progress through the game, the Nanosuit can be upgraded with a variety of loadouts.

Time for a change: As in the last two games, you can customise your 
weapons to suit your gameplay style. A new addition is the bow, which 
can be fitted with a range of tips - from explosive heads to those that 
deliver an electric shock

Ammo capacity can be increased, the energy bar can made to deplete slower, and increased cloaking time are but just a few of the upgrades, all adding to a unique, enjoyable combat experience.

A large part of this is down to the level design. Where Crysis 2 was largely criticised for being more linear than the original, Crysis 3 gets the balance just right most of the time.

Levels are much more sandbox-like, and usually contain numerous ways to get to an objective. One level which sees you taking down a CELL dam is a particularly good example of this.

Exploration is rewarded, too. Often venturing off the most obvious path rewards you with new weapons and modules you can use to upgrade your Nanosuit.

Sadly, enemy AI can be hit and miss. They sometimes get stuck in the surroundings or run around like headless chickens when under fire. They also have a bizarre tendency to randomly launch grenades when searching an area.

This game is extremely impressive visually, particularly on a high-powered PC. One of our testing units was running on an Nvidia 680GTX, which allowed the game to played at more than 30FPS on the highest settings. It is here where the gulf between console and PC graphics is at its largest.

The somewhat blocky vistas on the console versions are replaced by intricately detailed panoramas, while up close, textures are eye-poppingly realistic.

Open season: Crysis 3 represents a successful balancing act. Where gamers criticised Crysis 2 for being more linear, levels are now much larger and encourage exploration

This, coupled with superior lighting, draw distances and a host of Direct X 11 effects, means that to get the most from Crysis 3, it has to be played on PC.

The game also boasts an impressive multiplayer, offering a good variety of maps and clever twists on the standard game modes.

One such mode is Hunter that involves two cloaked hunters against a squad of troopers. Each killed trooper then switches sides and becomes a Hunter until there is one, scared, lonely trooper left.

Crysis 3 is definitely worth getting hold of. The campaign is somewhat short but there’s plenty of excitement to be had with the multiplayer. Time to suit up.
