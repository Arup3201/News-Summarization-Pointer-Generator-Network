Man is missing his best friend.

A Missouri army specialist suffering spinal and brain injuries as well as PTSD claims the army has 'stolen' the the combat dog he wants to adopt that  served as his only companion during months of deployment.

'They're not dog and handler, they're brothers,' Don Grommet, the soldier's father, told ABC news. 

More than a year ago, Brent Grommet, 23, assigned to the 101st Airborne Division out of Fort Campbell, Kentucky, returned from Afghanistan with his military combat dog, a German Shepherd named Matty.

Companion: Missouri army specialist Brent Grommet, 23, who is suffering spinal and brain injuries as well as PTSD is desperately trying to adopt the combat dog that served as his only companion during months of deployment

Grommet and Matty had gone through basic training together, been deployed together, and were both injured together in two separate IED (improvised explosive device) attacks, according to Fox 8. 

Procedure: Grommet followed the procedures necessary to adopt the dog but Matty was given to someone else

Upon returning to the United States, standard operating procedure forced the two to be separated.

With Grommet having already filled out the paperwork to adopt Matty, the separation would not last long -- or so he thought.

Months passed with Grommet making multiple calls inquiring about the adoption status to no avail, according to Fox 8.

The New York Post reports that the Grommets had been given little to no information about Matty and his adoption status and many military officials were flippant, with one even saying not to contact him again. 

In March, nearly a year after the pair returned from Afghanistan, Grommet said he received a call informing him that Matty had been adopted. 

The Grommet family told Fox 8 that a military contact tracked Matty to a man in the Fort Bragg area who said he had grown attached to Matty and wouldn't give him up to Grommet. 

The family told Fox 8 that they were desperately trying to find Matty's exact location hoping who ever had Matty would sell him or give him back to Brent. But military officials gave the family no information on who the man is or where exactly Matty is.

A Facebook post from the ABC 11 news page indicates that the American Humane Association is offering a minimum of $5,000 and a new war dog to Matty's owner. 

That was nearly three months ago.  

'It’s hard, it really is,' Grommet told the Post. 'If I just wanted a dog, I could get a dog. I don’t want a dog. I want my dog.'

Grommet told KTVI  that he's getting the 'run around' from military officials and has been filing Freedom of Information requests. 

But if and when he does get Matty, the dog will have a room of his own filled with tennis balls. 

KTVI reports that a spokesperson for Senator Claire McCaskill said her office has been working on Grommet's case for several weeks and hopes to have new information for the family soon.
