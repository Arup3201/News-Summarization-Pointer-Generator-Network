A revolutionary cream made from silicone claims to dramatically reduce unsightly scars and stretch marks in under a month.

Remescar, which works by 
covering the scar or stretch mark in a thin, invisible film of silicone, is said to reduce the appearance of skin problems by 50 per cent.

The film protects the top layer of skin in its own healing 
‘micro-environment’, sealing in moisture and helping stimulate the 
production of collagen, which boosts the skin’s recovery.

Stretch marks occur when the skin is stretched extensively over a short time period.

The rapid stretching causes the middle layer of skin (dermis) to break in places, allowing the deeper skin layers to show through, forming stretch marks.

The dermis is made-up of strong, inter-connected fibres that enable your skin to stretch as your body grows.

If part of your body, such as your abdomen (tummy), grows rapidly over a short period, the fibres can become thin and over-stretched and some may break.

At the point where the skin fibres break, tiny tears develop which allow the blood vessels below to show through. This is why stretch marks are often red or purple when they first appear.

When the blood vessels eventually contract (shrink), the pale-coloured fat underneath your skin will be visible, and your stretch marks will change to a silvery-white colour.

The product also includes beta glucan, a naturally occurring plant or yeast extract 
which has a proven protective and hydrating effect on wounds, and 
powerful SPF15 UV filters to shield against sun damage.

In clinical trials, users who applied it twice a day said they noticed a
 50 per cent reduction in the appearance of their stretch marks on their thighs, stomach and hips in 28 days - and some much sooner.

Patients with both existing and new scars, caused by 
minor surgery, burns, acne or accidents, who used the treatment, also 
reported a reduction in the length and height of their scarring.

They
 said the treatment helped to restore their skin to a more normal colour
 and texture, helping scars to fade and diminish. Sensations of burning,
 tingling and itching were also reduced.

The Belgian scientists behind the product claim it is the 'first medically recognised and clinically proven treatment 
for stretch marks to either
 reduce existing scars or treat new ones, and help treat and prevent 
stretchmarks'.

It is the first time that an easy-to-apply silicone treatment has been made available to the general public in Britain.

Traditional,
 professional silicone gel or sheet treatments for scars can often cause
 embarrassment to patients because they are visible to others.

They are also more expensive and can be difficult for the user to apply. Nine in ten women are affected by stretch marks - narrow streaks or lines that develop on the surface of the skin.

Although pregnancy is one of the most common causes, they can also 
affect young women who have not had children.  

Growth
 spurts and weight fluctuations can also cause them. 

While usually harmless but unsightly,  if there are clinical complications with stretchmarks then inflammation or itching can occur, causing pain and infection.

The treatment, which comes in a cream or deodorant-style stick, costs between £19.95 and £24.95 at Boots. 

The cream is a similar formulation to the
 stick, but easier for 
people with stretch marks to apply on a larger surface area.

A thin, transparent silicone film is released to hydrate, protect and restore the upper layer of the skin and stimulate collagen production, creating a protective barrier for scars to help heal.

The
 cream also helps to keep the skin's natural moisture balance under 
control, in turn helping it to soften and flatten scar tissue and 
restore the skin to a more normal colour and texture so that even old scars fade and diminish.

It also helps to relieve burning, tingling and itching sensations.

The product contains:

A
 powerful SPF15 UVA and UVB screenprotects scars from UV rays (scars 
need to be protected from UV radiation for least six months).

Beta glucan helps to hydrate the skin and is helps to form a film over the scar.

PVP
 (polyvinyl pyrrolidone) also a film forming agent and frequently used 
in the treatment of wounds.

It Is said to allow a longer contact time 
between the active ingredients and the damaged skin tissue so that the 
skin can repair itself faster

PVA (beta glucan) a well-known wound healer, calms, protects and hydrates the skin.

The cream is a similar formulation to the
 stick, but easier for 
people with stretch marks to apply on a larger surface area.
