Police are investigating whether a husband murdered his wife before killing himself at their quiet suburban home.

The bodies of Kenneth McRae, 52, and his wife Jane, 55, were discovered at their home at 11.30am yesterday.

Police were called to the couple's £190,000 three-storey semi-detached house in Rowley Regis, West Midlands, after Mr McRae's workmates reported him missing.

Tragic: A forensics team enter the house where detectives found a couple dead

Neighbours told detectives the couple had not been seen for a week.

West Midlands Police used a battering ram to break into the property where they discovered the couple's bodies.

Mrs McRae had suffered a blow to the head while her husband was found with neck and wrist injuries. 

They were both pronounced dead at the scene.

Police yesterday launched a murder investigation but said they were not looking for anyone else in connection with their deaths.

Detective Inspector Derek Packham said: 'We want to reassure the local community that we are not looking for anyone else in connection with this case.

Investigation: The couple were described as 'quiet' by neighbours. Local people have been shocked to learn of the news

'The families of the couple have been informed and we will continue to investigate the circumstances surrounding their deaths.'

Neighbours yesterday spoke of their shock over the deaths.

Dad-of-three Richard Hodgetts said: 'It is so sad.They were a very quiet couple. Nobody around here knew them and they kept themselves to themselves.'

One neighbour who lived opposite the scene said: 'It's just strange really you don't expect it to happen in your area. 

'We didn't really know them that well because they were quite reserved. We only knew them to say "hello" to.'

Mother-of-two Avril Cowdell, 69, said: 'I got back from shopping about 10.45am and the police were all in the street and they asked me if I had seen them in recently.

'I told them about a week ago and I thought they had been on holiday as they like to go away a lot.

'There was a light on in the bedroom which I had thought was a bit odd.'

Shocking: The families of the couple have been informed and police are continuing to investigate the situation

Concerns: Officers forced entry to the property at about 11:30am yesterday after concerns were raised about the occupants' welfare

Neighbour Chris Thompson, 35, added: 'I don't know what to say, you wouldn't really expect this to happen.

'To find out someone you live really close to, especially a couple which is quite strange - I'm just shocked really.'

A woman who lives opposite the couple said: 'The light in the first floor has been on for about a week and two days and at first I thought maybe they've gone on holiday and they've left the light on for security reasons because there is no alarm on the house.

'At the same time I still thought it was strange because he hadn't gone to work because his car is still there.

'Normally the lady is out doing the front garden and I noticed her hanging basket is not there, it is normally there this time of the year without fail.

'They moved in a few months before me in 2008, they were really nice, really quiet, ever so polite, they would say hello, just generally nice.

'I heard they adopted a son years ago but that is as far as I know, I never saw a child around the house.

'They were just a nice couple, it is really sad, you could tell they were so in love.'

Sorry we are unable to accept comments for legal reasons.
