Speculation surrounding Lukas Podolski's future has intensified after the German forward was left out of Arsenal's squad for their match against Everton.

The 29-year-old has been linked with a number of clubs, including Galatasaray and Wolfsburg while the Italian press claim Juventus are close to a deal for the former Bayern Munich man.

And there now appears to be some grounding to those rumours after Podolski posted a picture of inside Cologne's stadium while his team-mates prepared to face Everton.

Squad: While Podolski's team-mates per pare to face Everton the German forward was back in his home town

Arsenal confirmed that Podolski was not in Germany, but the forward had not travelled to Goodison Park either. 

Podolski, Mesut Ozil and Per Mertesacker all returned to Arsenal training this week after being given extra time off.

But while the other two both start for Arsenal later, Podolski did not even make the squad.

He tweeted: 'I won't be present in person but my thoughts are there with you lads. good luck at the match, go and represent, bring us the 3 points.' 

Germany international spoke recently of his love for Cologne (or Koln) in the German newspaper Bild.

Transfer: Both Podolski and the club have consistently denied that the forward is looking to move

He said: 'When I was finally back on the ground, I felt the typical Cologne euphoria, joy, and the hunger of the people for the Bundesliga. We all want to see FC there permanently.

'My attitude towards the club has never changed since the youth. It is the club that owns my whole heart. And I wish coaching staff, team, club and especially the fans good luck and to have a big season.'

Cologne are back in the Bundesliga after two seasons in the second tier.
