The house featured in the classic Christmas movie Home Alone will be looking radically different this holiday season after a dramatic makeover.

The stunning 1920s mansion, which is located on Chicago's North Shore, provided an important component of the 1990 family comedy blockbuster which catapulted child actor Macaulay Culkin briefly to mega-stardom.

Many scenes in the movie were filmed in the three-storey house including those featuring the kitchen, the main staircase, basement and most of the first floor landing.

The house featured in the classic Christmas movie Home Alone will be looking radically different this holiday season after a dramatic makeover

Now 25 years old, Home Alone stars Macaulay Culkin as young Kevin McCallister, left behind by his family when they fly to Paris for their Christmas vacation

In Home Alone Kevin initially relishes being home alone, but soon has to contend with two would-be burglars

The bedroom retains a four poster bed, but otherwise the decor is substantially more minimalist than it used to be

In 2012 the property changed hands with the buyers getting something of a bargain after the sellers agreed to take $1.58 million – nearly $1 million less than their original asking price

The house was built in 1921 and features five bedrooms, a fully converted attic, a detached double garage and a greenhouse.

In 2012 the property changed hands with the buyers getting something of a bargain after the sellers agreed to take $1.58 million – nearly $1 million less than their original asking price.

Despite its Hollywood pedigree and status as a tourist attraction, the property sat on the market for ten months from when it was first listed in May 2011 priced at $2.4 million.

Many will remember the colonial-style building in the Chicago suburb of Winnetka as the home of the McCallisters, and of course, the battlefield where Culkin's character Kevin took on those bumbling burglars.

The film - now 25 years old - stars Macaulay Culkin as young Kevin McCallister, left behind by his family when they fly to Paris for their Christmas vacation. Kevin initially relishes being home alone, but soon has to contend with two would-be burglars.

In the years since its cinematic release, Home Alone has become a beloved Yuletide staple full of heartwarming moments, slapstick comedy and a family-as-the-greatest-holiday-gift message.

The McCallister family home now looks very different from when it appeared in the 1990 movie. It might not be decked out in Christmas lights and decorations, but it remains instantly recognizable on the exterior

The property has a four-room master suite, a stunning forest-inspired dining area and the notorious attic bedroom where Kevin had to spend the night with his bed-wetting cousin in the film

The property's sellers, John and Cynthia Abendshien, had only lived in the house for 18 months when Christopher Columbus, the director of the first two Home Alone films, asking to film the movie there

'Very few homes have a leading role in a movie, in a sense becoming an additional character,' said listing agent Marissa Hopkins

The home also has plenty of nooks and crannies in which to hide, one of the features which made it perfect for the Home Alone movies.

'I think what attracted Hughes to the home is what's exemplified in the movie. It's a beautiful home with a lot of space and a warm feel. He liked to have real homes as his stage,' said Coldwell Banker agent Marissa Hopkins

A scout for John Hughes - who produced Home Alone - had approached the then owners, John and Cynthia Abendshien, about using the house in another Macaulay Culkin film, Uncle Buck.

The house sprawls over 4,250 square foot and is blocks away from Lake Michigan and the affluent suburb's village center.

The property's sellers, John and Cynthia Abendshien, had only lived in the house for 18 months when Christopher Columbus, the director of the first two Home Alone films, asking to film the movie there.

The franchise limped on to a third and fourth film after Columbus, but never captured the magic of the original.
