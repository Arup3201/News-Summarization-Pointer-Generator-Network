How does a three-day escape on a private 5.5 acre island resort that is accessible only by boat or seaplane, all to yourself, sound? Idyllic, right? Well it could be yours as long as you're willing to fork out a cool $250,000 (£164,000) for the pleasure.

Little Palm Island Resort & Spa in the Lower Florida Keys is offering up its entire 30-room resort for the period from April 24 to April 26 for this rather hefty fee that would be perfect - should you be well heeled enough to afford it - for a wedding party or other special occasion.

While $250,000 sounds like a lot, the 'Spring for a Private Island' breaks down to a touch over $8,000 (£5,200) per room or per couple if you chose to invite 59 of your nearest and dearest. And for that the guests will get plenty of additional value.

The 'Spring for a Private Island' promotion works out at a touch over $8,000 per room or couple if there's a total of 60 in the party 

The island is accessible only by seaplane or boat, although visitors can drive to nearby Little Torch Key and get a boat transfer

The lush tropical island is accessible only by boat or seaplane, according to Forbes, although you can drive relatively close via the A1A road from Miami and valet parking will be included. Alternatively, arrive on your yacht and use of the island dock will also be thrown in. 

Executive chef Roly Cruz-Taura will be on hand to provide divine eats at the Little Palm Island's Dining Room, which was ranked the third best hotel dining experience in the United States by the Zagat restaurant guide for its brand of French and Pan-Latin cuisine on a menu that changes daily. Although there is a dress code for dinner time. 

The resort’s spa, SpaTerre, combines eastern and western style treatments while guests will also get to benefit from the resort's staff that is all to keen to assist with whatever event you decide to hold. 

Little Torch Key, 29 miles by road to Key West, is a quick boat ride away and the resort also throws in motor yacht transfers with the $250,000 fee. 

Included in the $250,000 price tag is free boat transfers on the resort's cruiser The Truman to Little Torch Key

On arrival guests receive the resort's signature 'gumby slumber' cocktail, a ramped-up version of a Caribbean-style rum punch, plus a bottle of champagne in their one-bedroom suite. And anything non-alcoholic from the mini-bar is 'free' (included in the cost).

So what is there to do for fun? If you're into sun, sand and crystal clear water, plenty. Snorkelling jaunts for up to 12 people can be taken or fishing is plenty from the shore or with a spear.

For a sundowner or three, the Monkey Bar has guests covered but a cocktail party with a choice of 60 drinks is included in your food and board.

You could make s'mores around the fire pit and if it's just chilling out and enjoying the peace and quiet that you want, the island has a range of lounges and hammocks all around.
