Thousands of patients face being left without a doctor’s surgery after two GPs suddenly quit, complaining about their workload.

Dr Holly Hardy and Dr Karen Houghton have handed in their resignations to NHS England, blaming the Government's NHS reforms and cutbacks.

But the move means 6,000 patients will be left without a GP unless the NHS finds replacements - something the Bristol, surgery has failed to do since January 2012.

There is growing dissatisfaction with GP services, a new poll has revealed.

Patients' ratings of services  have fallen across the board, according to the survey of 900,000 people across England.

Families are less satisfied with their overall experience of the GP surgery, how they make appointments and their out of hours care, the poll found.

Fewer people would also recommend their practice to someone else, according to the GP Patient Survey.

While the levels of satisfaction have dipped, 85.7% of patients still rate their overall experience of their GP surgery as good.

But this is a one percent down on last year. The number of people who thought making an appointment was good, meanwhile, dipped 1.7 percent.

Satisfaction levels about out-of-hours GP services has also fallen four percent since June last year to 66.2%.

Meanwhile, less than eight in 10 would recommend their GP surgery to someone who had just moved into their local area - a decrease of 1.3 percent.

Dr Hardy, 49, blamed NHS restructuring which she said is putting off new recruits and driving older doctors into early retirement.

She said the last two years at St Martin’s Surgery in Knowle had been 'horrible'.

The doctor said: 'For the last six months it has been another doctor and myself who are supposed to work just three days between us, running a practice for 6,000 patients.

'It has been a very difficult decision to resign our contract with NHS England but we have been running at a third capacity. It has been horrible.

'We’ve been working extra hours - sometime till midnight - to clear paperwork.'

Asked for the reasons behind the shortage in staff, she said: 'I think it is a reflection on a national issue that has been in the background.

'There is more work for GPs than ever before. There has been a move to bring services out into primary care from secondary care which is great, but the funding and resources have not followed.

'Also there is an issue with recruitment. Young doctors don’t want to go into GP practice because they are seeing how difficult it is.

'And a lot of GPs are retiring early because it is just too much.'

South Bristol Labour MP Dawn Primarolo has written to Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt demanding action.

She said: 'There is no doubt this will cause significant anxiety and distress for patients registered at St Martins, which I know has an outstanding local reputation.

'They will want to know why young doctors don’t want to join a well-run successful surgery and what action NHS England has taken.

'The bigger question is how many GP surgeries in Bristol and in other parts of the country are under similar threat?

'Rather than focusing on patients, this Government has created chaos within the NHS with a massive reorganisation which has created a crisis in primary care.

'Jeremy Hunt should stop criticising GPs and get a grip of what is really happening.'

St Martin's Surgery in Knowle, Bristol, is now facing closure - leaving thousands of people without a doctor's surgery

A spokeswoman for NHS England said the move does not necessarily mean the surgery will close.

She said: “While the resignation of the current contract holders at St Martin’s Surgery has been accepted, this does not mean that the surgery will close.

'We will be seeking a provider for an interim GP service whilst options for the long-term future of the surgery are considered.

'We will engage with stakeholders and patients about these options as they are developed.

'We are committed to ensuring that patients have access to high quality, local GP services.'
