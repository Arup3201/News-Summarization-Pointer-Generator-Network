Cleansing: Actress Jane Fonda, seen at this year's Oscars, says she has finally 'made peace' with her body at the age of 75

After struggling with eating disorders for most of her life, Jane Fonda says she has at last ‘made peace’ with her body.

The 75-year-old has twice-daily yoga sessions and recently went through a week-long cleansing regime, avoiding all dairy products, red meat, wheat and coffee.

However she claimed she has given up her quest for a perfect figure, saying: ‘For a woman, making peace with your body is a work in progress.

'I have spent time in therapy, written books that have helped me heal – as well as helped others.

‘For me, healing meant understanding that “good enough” is good. We don’t have to be perfect.’

The actress, who won Oscars for her roles in the 1971 movie Klute and Coming Home in 1978, took on the role of fitness guru in 1982 with the release of an aerobics tutorial which became the most successful fitness video of all time.

But she later revealed she had suffered eating disorders from the age of 12, veering between a series of food binges and purges.

Although she was spotted tucking into a greasy cheeseburger at an Oscars after-party, she insisted she is still devoted to healthy eating.

‘I started the year with a week-long cleanse – no coffee, dairy, red meat or wheat,’ she told Hello! magazine.

‘Instead I had lots of juices, vegetables, chicken and fish, oats, beans and cleansing teas.

'I’m still basically eating that way now, and will probably never go back to coffee. I eat fish, especially salmon and tuna, three times a week. This is really good for older people.’

Miss Fonda recently released a yoga DVD for the elderly – her 27th fitness tutorial – with her partner Richard Perry, 70.

She said: ‘Yoga makes me feel great, alive, awake, and as we get older it’s important to stay flexible and strong, which yoga helps with.

‘I’ve had a knee and hip replacement and had major back surgery last March, so my ability to do a full lotus position, for instance, is reduced. But I do this DVD with my boyfriend and it is totally safe.’

She added: ‘There are morning segments 
that each work on slightly different areas, designed to wake you up and 
get you energised for the day.  Then there are evening segments to calm 
you down and ready you for bed.’
