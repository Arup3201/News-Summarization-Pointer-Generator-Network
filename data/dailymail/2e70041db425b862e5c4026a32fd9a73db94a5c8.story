Female soccer superstar Abby Wambach wed fellow pro soccer player Sarah Huffman Saturday in a sunset ceremony on the beach.

The I Do's took place at the Villas at Po’ipu Kai on the island of Kauai and was attended by some of two-time gold medalist Wambach's Olympic teammates, including Alex Morgan and Sydney Leroux.

The union is a seriously talented one: In addition to living their lives together, the two women play pro soccer together on the Western New York Flash.

This according to TMZ, where it was reported that the couple's closest friends and family had joined them for the Hawaii ceremony.

Photos of Wambach's comely Olympic teammate Sydney Leroux show her and another fellow gold medalist, Alex Morgan, having fun in the Hawaii sun over the weekend.

Blushing bride Sarah Huffman also showed of the tropical locale of the wedding using social media.

'Arrived in paradise,' she tweeted October 1 along with a picture of a rocky beach.

While Wambach and Huffman have been rumored to be an item for some time, they never officially announced they were dating.

Nor had Wambach ever officially come out as a lesbian.

Huffman only did so this year, as she quietly announced she was partnering with the LGBT website Athlete Ally.

‘I dream of a world full of equal chances and opportunities as well as treatment and I am proud to be an athlete ally,’ Huffman said. ‘Discrimination based upon race, gender, and sexual orientation should have no place in the world, especially in sports because I believe it is place where everybody belongs. I am thrilled to be an ally and stand up for individuals like me in the lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender (LGBT) community.’
