Former world No 1 Tiger Woods will  drop outside the top 100 in the rankings on Monday for the first time in more than 18 years.

The 39-year-old American is down at No 96 and a world ranking official revealed that he is likely to slip to No 102 when the list is adjusted after this weekend's tournaments.

Woods posted an 82 at the Phoenix Open in January, his worst round as a professional, as he slumped outside the leading 50 in the rankings for the first time in more than three years.

Since then the 14-time major winner has continued a downward slide that resulted in him failing to qualify for this month's WGC-Cadillac Championship, an event he has won seven times.

Woods is yet to make a decision on whether he will play at the Masters, which begins on April 9.Â 

Woods was ranked 433rd when he turned professional in September 1996.

He then jumped to 75th after landing his first victory as a professional at the 1996 Las Vegas Invitational, the first of 79 PGA Tour titles.

Woods first moved to world No 1 when he finished 19th at the 1997 US Open.

The American spent a record total of 683 weeks at the top of the rankings until he lost the No 1 spot to Australia's Adam Scott in May 2014.

Current No 1 Rory McIlroy has been top of the rankings since August.
