Plea: Gary Lineker appealed for help on Twitter after his mother Margaret's car was stolen by thieves who followed her home from hospital

Gary Lineker's elderly mother was targeted by thieves who followed her home from the hospital where she was receiving dialysis before stealing her handbag and taking her car. 

The thieves watched as poorly Margaret Lineker, 74, used a cashpoint machine at the hospital, then tailed her back to the house.

Her Vauxhall Corsa was stolen and more 
than £1,000 was later spent on her bank card at a clothes store in 
Gary's hometown of Leicester.

The Match Of The Day host, 53, and brother Wayne turned to Twitter at the weekend to appeal to their combined two million followers for the return of the car.

It has emerged that Margaret was the victim of calculating thieves, who are believed to have watched as she entered her pin number.

The car was packed with personal possessions ahead of her planned move to a new home on the Isle of Wight, including an ornamental brass eagle named 'hat-trick' which she kissed every time Gary scored a goal for Leicester.

The lucky charm had been a gift from Gary and Wayne.

A good Samaritan later found the personal items dumped in a lay-by in the Syston area of Leicester and returned them to a police station.

Margaret had been at hospital when she withdrew £200 from a cashpoint in the reception.

She then went to her dialysis session before driving home, where the thieves struck within minutes, entering her porch and taking the bag.

Wayne Lineker said: 'It's just beyond me how anyone could do this to a lady who turns 75 in March.

'She's had a terrible year as she lost her husband through cancer and now this. The first thing she did was ask for a big cuddle and broke down crying.

Reward: The Match Of The Day presenter tweeted this appeal for help after his mother's car was stolen

Heartbreaking: The Match Of The Day presenter tweeted details of the theft, and said his mother's car was full of personal posessions ahead of her move to the Isle of Wight

'Fortunately she's quite strong and she's in pretty good spirits but she just wants 2013 out of the way. It happened at the worst possible time.'

Gary has offered a reward for information leading to the return of the car.

He
tweeted: 'Some rotter has stolen my mum's car after dialysis in 
Leicester. Silver/grey Corsa EX09TXE. I'll reward any help with return. 
RT please.'

He added: 'A lot of her personal possessions were in the car as she's moving home. Poor women (sic) is heartbroken.'

Wayne, 51, 
said: 'The only fortunate thing is that she went into the house and left
her bag on the porch. She had only stopped for 10 minutes to do a few 
bits and pieces.

Terrible: Wayne Lineker said the theft of his mother's car had happened 'at the worst possible time'

Prized: The car was packed with personal possessions including an ornamental brass eagle named 'hat-trick' which she kissed every time Gary, left, scored a goal for Leicester

'It doesn't bear thinking what could have happened if the thieves had entered the house.'

Wayne Lineker said that his mother, who only has one kidney, needs dialysis four times a week for four hours a time.

He said that she started the treatment around eight months ago, and also suffered the loss of her husband, Wayne and Gary's stepdad, Peter Morris, earlier this year.

The grandmother has since moved to the Isle of Wight, where her two brothers live, but the family is appealing for information leading to the return of the car.

Leicestershire Police were today combing through CCTV footage from the hospital.

PC Aimee Farmer, the investigating officer, said: 'The incident has caused great distress to the victim and the vehicle contained many treasured items at the time of the theft.

'Gary and his brother Wayne have been doing all they can through the media to help locate their mother’s car and are eager for its return.

'We would like to appeal to anyone who may have witnessed the theft or has any information about the current whereabouts of the vehicle to please get in touch.'
