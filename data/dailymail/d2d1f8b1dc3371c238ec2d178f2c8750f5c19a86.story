A brutal rapist who terrorised a suburb for two decades, preying on elderly and disabled women living alone, has finally been jailed.

Michael Roberts, 45, raped three women and viciously attacked a fourth in a spate of attacks in Bermondsey, south London, in the 1980s and early 1990s.

Detectives finally caught up with him 15 years later in a cold case review of his crimes. Advances in DNA evidence helped police pinpoint the serial criminal.

Guilty: Michael Roberts, 45, has been found guilty of raping elderly women in Bermondsey, south London, during a campaign of terror in the 1980s and early 1990s

Police had long been baffled as to the 
identity of the rapist, known as the 'Bermondsey Beast' and also as 'The
Praying Rapist' after a victim recalled him crossing himself and 
uttering part of a Catholic prayer.

A jury at Southwark Crown Court this week found
Roberts guilty of three charges of rape, four charges of burglary, two 
charges of indecent assaults and two charges of causing grievous bodily 
harm with intent.

His rape victims were aged 57, 66, and 77 and the assault victim was 83. All lived within a short distance of his home.

Roberts,
who had a 'substantial criminal record', attacked the 57-year-old woman
so savagely that she was left with a broken jaw and a fractured eye 
socket.

Forty-six suspects were interviewed 
and eliminated. DNA evidence was also collected, but technology was not 
advanced enough to use it in identifying the culprit.

Roberts was found guilty at Southwark Crown Court of three charges of rape, four charges of burglary, two charges of indecent assaults and two charges of causing grievous bodily harm with intent

Then, in 2005, thanks to new techniques, Roberts was finally identified after a DNA match.

At that time, he was serving a life sentence for the brutal robbery and assault of an elderly man in his home in Lee.

Detective Inspector Nathan Eason, who led the investigation, today spoke of his relief that Roberts was finally caught.

He
said: 'Michael Roberts obviously has no regard for the lives of others,
and picks on those least able to defend themselves in order to steal 
their property.

'In the 
late 1980s, he went even further by committing vile sexual attacks on 
his victims which are beyond most peopleâ€™s comprehension.

'Thanks to the advances in DNA, Michael Roberts was identified and has been convicted.

'He will have many years in prison to reflect on the suffering he has caused.

'Unfortunately, none of his victims lived to see him finally brought to justice for what he has done.'

Dubbed the 'Beast Of Bermondsey', Roberts left elderly women in the south London community (pictured) in fear during the 1980s and 1990s

The
fresh investigation was headed by Detective Chief Inspector Brian 
Bowden-Brown, who was brought out of retirement for the case.

He knew he had his man when he asked 
Roberts to remove his top and found brown marks and moles, which one of 
his victims had mentioned to police.

Roberts's former neighbours of south London today remembered him as a violent man who they tried to avoid.

They said he was frequently abusive towards his girlfriends and the court had heard he had been violent towards two partners.

One neighbour said: 'You heard him because they was always fighting. He had the kids screaming - he used to smash the place up.

'He used to count up to ten and, if he got there, he would smash the place up.

'It sounded like wardrobes were coming down the stairs.'

Roberts is due to be sentenced on January 12.
