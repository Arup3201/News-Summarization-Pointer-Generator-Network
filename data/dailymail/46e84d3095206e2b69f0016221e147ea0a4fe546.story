An increasingly confident Barack Obama has returned to his rhetoric of 2008, presenting himself as a challenger to the status quo who will change politics and railing against ‘lobbyists and special interests’ in Washington.

Speaking before 10,000 people in the Democratic heartland of Boulder, Colorado, Obama, his voice hoarse, delivered a fiery 36-minute speech designed to whip up his base of voters and rekindle some of the magic of four years ago ahead of Tuesday's election.

Must win: Mitt Romney needs to take Virginia and Florida

Obama has edged ahead in the RealClearPolitics average of national polls by just 0.1 per cent and appears to have an advantage in the crucial swing state of Ohio. He is very much in contention too in Virginia and Florida, which his opponent Mitt Romney must win.

But Obama is campaigning in Wisconsin, Colorado and Nevada, states he won easily in 2008 and which hoped would have been in the bag by now. If Ohio, Florida and Virginia fall, his aides calculate, these states might save him.

‘Back in 2008, when we talked about 
change, I told you I wasn’t just talking about changing Presidents.  I 
wasn’t just talking about changing parties,’ Obama said in Boulder. ‘I 
was talking about changing our politics.

‘I ran because the voices of the American people - your voices - had been shut out of our democracy for way too long by lobbyists and special interests, and politicians who believe that compromise is a dirty word and who would say anything to win office, and do anything to stay in office.’

Plans: Obama said 'the future doesn't have many lobbyists'

Despite having included many former 
lobbyists in his administration, Obama said: ‘The future doesn’t have 
lobbyists. They’ll never have as many lobbyists as the vested interests.
Never have as many lobbyists as the past does.’

Lobbyists, however, have been frequent and repeated visitors to the Obama White House. According to the Washington Post, Tim Hannegan, who lists Taser International as a client has been to the White House more than 30 times under Obama.

Bill Samuel, lobbyist for the AFL-CIO, has been by more than 50 times. Michael Taylor, a lobbyist for the Monsanto corporation, has been 25 times. Former Senator. Chris Dodd, a lobbyists for the Motion Picture Association of America, has been more than a dozen times.

But the populist rhetoric was lapped up by the crowd as Obama promised 100,000 new ‘math and science teachers’ and training for two million workers.

Not the status quo: Romney said he was the real agent of change

Obama sought to seize back the mantle of change from Romney, who has recently claimed he is the real candidate of change and Obama represents the status quo in Washington.

‘I know what real change looks like, because I fought for it,’ Obama said. ‘I've got the scars to prove it. You have, too. And after all that we've been through together, Colorado, we sure as heck can't give up now.’

The argument is unlikely to persuade many swing voters, who have become jaded after four years of high unemployment, soaring debt and partisan gridlock in Washington. But it is a message that resonates among diehard Democrats, who Obama desperately needs to go to the polls.

Obama also looked back to the Bush years, blaming his predecessor for the mess that he had spent ‘four years cleaning up’ and harking back to President Bill Clinton’s time in the White House from 1993 to 2001.

‘We know the ideas that worked,’ Obama said in Green Bay, Wisconsin. ‘We also know the ideas that don't work. Because in the eight years after Bill Clinton left office, his policies were reversed.’
