Rant: Morrissey wrote on a fan site that he was 'unable' to watch the London Olympics

Former frontman of The Smiths Morrissey has slammed Great Britain fans for their support of the country's athletes in the London Olympics, asking: 'Has England ever been so foul with patriotism?'

The rock star, who has come out with controversial remarks in the past, has said that he can not even bring himself to watch the Olympics, slating the presence of the Royal Family and David and Victoria Beckham in the process.

He even likened fans of the country's growing support of their athletes to a mindset held by the populace Nazi Germany in the late 1930s, and told Brits to 'WAKE UP'.

The 53-year-old singer will not have been celebrating, or even watching, on Saturday when Team GB brought home a remarkable eight gold medals - their best haul in a day since the 1908 London Games.

Morrissey, who fronted one of Britain's most influential bands, published a statement on the True to You fan site: 'I am unable to watch the Olympics due to the blustering jingoism that drenches the event. Has England ever been quite so foul with patriotism? 

'The "dazzling royals" have, quite naturally, hi-jacked the Olympics for their own empirical needs, and no oppositional voice is allowed in the free press. 

'It is lethal to witness. As London is suddenly promoted as a super-wealth brand, the England outside London shivers beneath cutbacks, tight circumstances and economic disasters.

Not celebrating? Ennis won gold on a remarkable Saturday for the British, when they won three gold medals in athletics

'Meanwhile the British media present 
24-hour coverage of the "dazzling royals", laughing as they lavishly 
spend, as if such coverage is certain to make British society feel fully
 whole. In 2012, the British public is evidently assumed to be 
undersized pigmies, scarcely able to formulate thought.

'As
 I recently drove through Greece I noticed repeated graffiti seemingly 
everywhere on every available wall. In large blue letters it said WAKE 
UP WAKE UP.

'It could 
almost have been written with the British public in mind, because 
although the spirit of 1939 Germany now pervades throughout media-brand 
Britain, the 2013 grotesque inevitability of Lord and Lady Beckham (with
 Sir Jamie Horrible close at heel) is, believe me, a fate worse than 
life. WAKE UP WAKE UP.'

The singer's latest rant has not gone down at all well on Twitter, where many users have taken to the site to hit back at Morrissey.

What a haul: Mo Farah (centre) and Great Britain are on course to beat their previous record of 19 gold medals in the London Games

Disapproval: Morrissey ranted that the 'Dazzling Royals' had dominated the Olympics

@PunkHammer said on his profile: 'He 
is as dogmatic as those he opposes. Unable to see anything but his own 
ideas as correct. #morrissey '

@PHarrisonYP quipped: 'He'll not be at the closing ceremony then.'

@gwarizm
 tweeted their views on the rocker's rant against the Games: 'Morrissey 
complaining about nationalism? A case of the pot calling the kettle 
"devious, truculent and unreliable.'

And @ameliadodge simply said: 'i feel like Morrissey lost his touch after he left The Smiths #opinion #haterswillhate'

Champion: The black athlete Jesse Owens, who won four gold medals at the 1936 Olympics in Berlin and embarrassed Hitler, who had intended to use the Games to promote his Aryan ideals

This is not the first time Morrissey has made remarks that have caused a stir.

The singer, whose former band once released an album called Meat Is Murder, criticised the Chinese for their treatment of animals.

Morrissey is a well-established vegetarian and animal rights campaigner.

Speaking to the Guardian Weekend magazine about China's treatment of circus animals, he said: 'Did you see the thing on the news about their treatment of animals and animal welfare?

'Absolutely horrific. You can't help but feel that the Chinese are a subspecies'.

He has also made anti-Royal comments in the past. Last year, when the Queen visited Ireland on a state visit, he even likened Her Royal Highness Elizabeth II to the former Libyan tyrant Muammar Gaddafi.

He wrote in Irish magazine Hot Press last year: 'The very existence of the Queen and her now enormous family ... is 
entirely against any notion of democracy, and is against freedom of 
speech. For a broad historical view of what the Queen is and how she 
'rules', examine Gaddafi or Mubarak, and see if you can spot any 
difference.'

The Smiths wrote their 1986 album The Queen is Dead, and sang the lyrics: 'Her very Lowness with a head in a sling/ I'm truly sorry – but it sounds like a wonderful thing.'
