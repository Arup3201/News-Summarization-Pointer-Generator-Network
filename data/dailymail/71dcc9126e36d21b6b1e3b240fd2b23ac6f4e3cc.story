A terrier destined for a life indoors after vets discovered he suffers from hay fever has been relieved of his symptoms thanks to a Lycra onesie.

One-year-old Alfie would be covered in painful, red and itchy sores after going for walks with owner Joanne Mitchell, 50, from Cullingworth, West Yorkshire.

The dog was given various treatments including Piriton before Mrs Mitchell discovered the revolutionary silver bodysuit while searching for a cure online.

One-year-old Alfie was diagnosed with a pollen allergy after he came up with red itchy sores after walks

Mrs Mitchell said: 'He was booked in to be castrated around April, May time and I noticed he had a really really itchy red tummy.

'I thought it might be fleas at first but after talking to the vet we realised it might be a pollen allergy.

She added: 'We tried numerous things including Piriton but nothing seemed to work and he was just miserable.'

'It
 got to the point where he was just trapped in the house unable to go 
out. To have a dog that can’t even go out for a walk is just awful, I 
felt terrible.'

It was then that she came across US-based company K9 Top Coat and decided to give the one-of-a-kind lightweight, breathable onesie a shot.

'Everything changed from there. He’s so much better now and the sores have really settled down,' she added.

Owner Joanne Mitchell has bought Alfie another suit so he can alternate his look

'He
 wears his bodysuit all day long and he loves it. He puts his little 
head in and lifts his paws up to help me put it on, it really doesn’t 
bother him at all.

'Now he can go and play outside and enjoy running around without a care.'

The all-in-one, which can set pet owners back anything from £34 ($58.50) to £50 ($86.50), has proven so popular with the Jack Russell Terrier that Mrs Mitchell has chosen to buy a second outfit.

'It’s been so great I’ve bought him another so I can alternate. He’ll have his own little wardrobe full of them soon.'

The idea for the onesie was thought up by June Lotz, co-founder of K9 Top Coat.

She said: 'I came up with the idea as a way of controlling shedding.

'Our first child was just beginning to crawl and with three large dogs it was impossible to keep our floors free of dog hair.

'Many people purchase one of our lycra bodysuits and have such great success they purchase more.

'We
 have a lot of word of mouth referrals but then again the coat speaks 
for itself, there’s nothing like having a dog wearing a lycra bodysuit 
in the park or walking down the street to draw people’s attention.

'The
 joy I experience when I hear that one of our bodysuits has dramatically
 improved the quality of a dog’s life is beyond words. It’s times like 
that when I know I have the best job in the world.'
