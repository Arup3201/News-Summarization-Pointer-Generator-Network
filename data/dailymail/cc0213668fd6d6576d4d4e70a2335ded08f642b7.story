An angry homeowner has been fined for embedding nails in a wooden board on the corner of his lawn  to stop drivers using it as a shortcut.

The resident in Pevely, Missouri, set up the booby-trap because they were fed up of cars driving across the grass.

The device was painted black and dug into the ground making it 'difficult to see' and would burst the tyres of any car passing over. 

Trap: The resident in Pevely, Missouri, embedded nails into a wooden plank and buried it into the ground to stop people using their lawn as a short cut

Punishment: The homeowner has been fined for setting up the device after city officials said it was dangerous 

But city officials said it was dangerous and have punished them.

Police chief Ron Weeks told KMOV4: 'They were painted black and buried in the ground, and it made it very difficult to see. Nobody has been hurt by them but the potential for injury is quite high.'

Several neighbors said they understood why the homeowner set up the buried boards, but think the trap is dangerous.

On resident said: 'I think it's a bad idea. Someone could get hurt.' Another added: 'I can understand why he would want to do it but people could get hurt and that is not acceptable'.  

The homeowner refused to be interviewed on camera but told the channel they felt the victim was being punished. 

Pevely City Council have put together an ordinate to stop residents setting up similar booby-traps as a result.

Prevention: Police Chief Ron Weeks has drawn up a 'booby-trap ordinate' to stop residents setting up the 'dangerous' devices
