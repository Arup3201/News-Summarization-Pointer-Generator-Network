Mystery man: The man was jailed for a robbery in 1997, and has since claimed he hails from Canada, South Africa and Kazakhstan (stock image)

A foreign national has avoided deportation from Sweden for more than ten years, by claiming he has forgotten where he is from.

The 44-year-old man committed aggravated robbery in Stockholm in 1997 and was jailed for five years, after which he was set to be deported.

However, while in prison, the man claims to have suffered amnesia and does not know which country he is from – or at least cannot make up his mind about it.

In 1997, the man was involved in an 
armed robbery of a jeweller’s shop in the Swedish capital, and found 
guilty alongside at least one other man.

During
 the trial, he claimed to be from the former Soviet Union, his family 
hailing from Kazakhstan where he said they lived under threat.

He
 was sentenced to five years and immediate deportation for life.

Although he was released from prison after three years, in 2000, he remained in 
custody as neither the police or the Swedish Migrationboard could 
identify him.

In a 2002 
interview the man claimed his name was Edward Brown.

He said he thought he was 
born in South Africa to a Polish mother and South African stepfather, 
but his amnesia made him unsure.

A
 year later, in 2003, still being held by police, he told Svenska 
Dagbladet: ‘I just want my freedom, it is my human right.

'And then I 
will not stay in Sweden, I will make my way home to Canada.’

He told the paper he did not remember telling the court he was from Kazakhstan in 1997, not did he know how he suffered amnesia.

He was released later that year, telling police he was definitely from the former Soviet Union, and has since been working as an artist in Karlstad, a small town in south-east Sweden.

As Swedish Police have been unable to identify him, nor prove whether he is telling the truth about suffering amnesia, they are still unable to deport him - and do not know where to send him.

The 44-year-old has made several attempts to overturn the ruling to deport him, but they have been denied.

Now, 17 years after his robbery conviction, the Swedish Migration board has applied for the Migration Court of Appeal to take up the case and affirm the deportation.
