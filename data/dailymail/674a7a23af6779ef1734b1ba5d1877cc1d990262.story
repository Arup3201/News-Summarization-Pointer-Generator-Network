When Sir John Hall announced during the 1990s  his vision for Newcastle United to field a team of 11 Geordies at St James' Park in the future, the idea seemed fanciful at best.

And, in the two decades since, the Premier League has become an increasingly international game, with young foreign talent squeezing out the opportunities for upcoming local players.

Yet, on Sunday, Alan Pardew could send out a Newcastle United XI containing five Tynesiders - the first time that number will have started a match for the Magpies against bitter rivals Sunderland in the history of the Premier League.

There have been 24 Tyne-Wear - or Wear-Tyne - derbies in the Premier League, and never before have five Geordies taken to the field at the beginning of the match clad in black and white.

Defenders Paul Dummett and Steven Taylor, winger Sammy Ameobi, midfielder Jack Colback and goalkeeper Jak Alnwick - who has been passed fit to play despite picking up a shoulder injury against Tottenham Hotspur - are all in line to appear at St James' Park in Sunday's 153rd derby.

Young Geordie striker Adam Armstrong is also likely to get a place on the bench for Newcastle

Newcastle players celebrate against Sunderland in the 3-2 victory at St James' Park in October 2005 - the last time six Geordies featured in a matchday squad for the Magpies against the Black Cats

And, with youngster Adam Armstrong likely to be among the replacements, the Magpies could have six Geordies in their squad against Sunderland for the first time since October 2005.

On that day, Newcastle beat Sunderland 3-2 at St James' with the help of Peter Ramage, Shola Ameobi, Lee Clark, Michael Chopra and their favourite Geordie son, Alan Shearer. 

Taylor also featured in the line-up that day and is the only survivor heading into this weekend. 

Pardew will be hoping the abundance of Geordie talent will be able to inspire Newcastle and end their miserable recent record against their North East rivals.

The Magpies have lost three derbies in succession - two matches at St James' ended 3-0 to the visitors - and have failed to win a home match against the Black Cats since their 5-1 victory on October 31, 2010.

Newcastle have never lost four in a row to Sunderland and, following the 4-0 Capital One Cup quarter-final humiliation at Spurs in midweek, another defeat is unlikely to sit well with the Toon Army.

Newcastle have lost the last three derbies in succession, including 3-0 at St James' Park last season

In fact, Gus Poyet's Sunderland are unbeaten in five North East derbies and appear to have had the psychological edge over Newcastle in recent matches - something Pardew will believe his Geordie representatives can rectify.

And the presence of Colback in Magpies colours as opposed to the red-and-white stripes he adorned at the Stadium of Light for six years has added yet more intrigue to an already-fascinating fixture.

Colback made 135 appearances for the Black Cats and played against Newcastle last season

Ex-Sunderland striker and chairman Niall Quinn has already lamented the loss of Colback, explaining that the club did not nurture the 25-year-old to then see him star for their rivals.

But with so many local players in with a chance of representing Newcastle in what, for many supporters, is the biggest home match of the season, it fits in perfectly with the club's 'Black and White Derby' idea.

Posters have been displayed, emails sent out to fans and messages posted on the club website advertising the initiative and encouraging supporters to wear their replica shirts, bring along their Newcastle scarves and other attire to cover St James' Park in a 'sea of black and white.'

This game is huge for both sets of supporters - and for Newcastle fans, they expect nothing less than a victory.
