Landon Donovan, widely considered as the USA's best ever footballer, says he will retire at the end of the MLS season.

The 32-year-old LA Galaxy forward is the top goalscorer in MLS history and a five-time league champion.

Donovan was named the most valuable player of his 14th MLS All-Star game on Wednesday night in Portland, scoring a goal in the All-Stars' 2-1 win over Bayern Munich.

Stars of the game: Donovan played with the likes of David Beckham during his time at LA Galaxy

'After careful deliberation and after many conversations with those closest to me, I have decided that this will be my last season as a professional soccer player,' Donovan said in an open letter on La Galaxy's website. 'I will miss all of the teammates who helped me create so many incredible memories on-the-field, and who I have shared many wonderful experiences with off-the-field.

'I will miss my coaches, at both the club and national team levels, who have helped me develop throughout my career and helped make me the player I am today. 

'However, after spending half my life as a professional soccer player, I also am excited to begin a new chapter and pursue other opportunities that will challenge me and allow me to grow as a person.' 

Premier League move: Donovan featured for Everton on two separate loan spells

Donovan agreed to a multiyear contract extension with the Galaxy just a year ago, pronouncing himself revitalized after an extended sabbatical. He took several months off after winning the Galaxy's second straight MLS Cup title alongside now-retired David Beckham in December 2012.

He also enjoyed two fruitful loan spells at Everton in the Premier League.

Donovan played in the three World Cups from 2002-2010, but didn't make the squad for Brazil.
