A devoted daughter has given her father the ultimate send-off by sending his ashes in a bottle around the world.

Former coal miner Brian Lynn died on July 4 last year, but his daughter Nicci Welsh wanted to give him one final journey. 

So, on July 26 this year, Mrs Welsh, her husband Craig and son Kieran, along with Mr Lynn's wife, Annette, took the bottle to South Shields Pier and cast him off into the North Sea. 

Mrs Welsh has asked people to take this message out and write their name, the date and location on it if they see the bottle  on a shore. They should then put the lid back on  and throw the bottle back into the water

Mrs Welsh's father, Brian Lynn, died on July 4 last year. He retired from work a decade before he died aged 76 and developed a passion for travelling and his daughter has now sent his ashes in a bottle around the world 

The bottle that Mrs Welsh cast into the North Sea on July 26 this year contains her father's ashes, a letter and a penny for good luck to send him on his final journey

Nicci Welsh, 29, pictured with her son, Kieran, said she 'wanted to do something special' for her father

The bottle contains a letter, a penny for good luck and a small tub with her father's ashes. 

Mrs Welsh, 29, a regional adminstrator from Houghton-le-Spring in Tyne and Wear, has now posted her father's story online so people who find the bottle can send pictures to keep track of his adventure. 

She has also asked people to take the message out and write their name, the date and location on it if they spot the bottle perched on a shore.

They should then put the lid back on tightly and throw the bottle far enough back into the water, so his journey can continue.  

Mr Lynn, retired from work a decade before he died aged 76 and developed a passion for travelling and in particular, cruises. 

Together with his wife Annette, 68, he travelled across North America, Egypt and Europe. 

And it was his passion for travel that inspired his daughter to send his ashes around the world.

Brian Lynn, a former coal miner, developed a passion for passion and especially cruises. He died on July 4 last year and his daughter cast his ashes into the North Sea on July 26 this year

I have created a page called Brian Lynn My Final Adventure... please could you check it out and share my dads story .... if not then thank you so much for taking your time to read this XxX

I would like you to meet my Father Brian Lynn…

On July 4 2013 sadly my father passed away, he was a very happy chap that loved to surround himself with family, happiness, joy and most of all he loved to travel. On July 26 2014 I decided to send my dad on his final adventure. A message in a bottle containing a letter, a penny for good luck and a small tub containing dads ashes.

All that I ask, is if you see him perched on a shore, take the message out pop your name, date and location on the letter. I would be very grateful if you could take a picture to upload on to this page, this would be simply amazing. We would love to know where his journey takes him. Don't forget to pop the lid back on tight and throw him far enough back in to the water, so he can carry out the rest of his FINAL ADVENTURE.

Thank you so much for taking the time, I dont know if this will workout but I would love for this to reach as many shores as possible. 

Mrs Welsh said: 'He always loved his travelling, it just sort of came to me one day, I wanted to do something special for him but I couldn't quite put my finger on what I wanted to do for him.

'Dad did a lot of cruises, especially in the last ten years when it felt like he never came off cruises.

'He took his camera with him, you would think that maybe 50 or 60 photos of the exact same location would be enough, but obviously it wasn't, he just took loads and loads. He loved it.

'He had his hand into everything in life, he was a pitman and from there he went on to be a gardener. 

'He was 76, but he retired about 10 years ago around the same time he started on the cruises.

'His main love was Egypt and he actually said to me before he died "just stick us in your pocket, with a little hole in the pocket, and walk around the Pyramids scattering my ashes".

'I'm not sure you're allowed to do that, so this is the next best thing.'

Brian Lynn developed a passion for travelling and particularly enjoyed visiting the Pyramids in Egypt

Mrs Welsh shared her story online on the site Lostbox and has been taken aback by the response.  

'I'm so overwhelmed by all the response now since I put his story online, everyone wants to find Brian.

'If he was here now and he could see the response he would be absolutely ecstatic.

'I've had so many messages, it's absolute crazy. Reading through those messages I've never felt so many emotions, sad of course, but at the same time, so happy. 

'I think people will be a little be intrigued about what's in there, you can see my dad's photo in there.

'I've asked them to put their name, date and location on the note and if possible send me a picture.'

Clare Owen, founder of Lostbox, said: 'After receiving Nicci's heartfelt appeal, we have been overwhelmed by the messages of support for Nicci and her family reaching across different continents.'
