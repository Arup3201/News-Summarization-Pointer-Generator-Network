IIt only took a minute for police to arrive on the scene causing the robbers to flee.

2 P.M. - Three armed men enter a Bank of the West branch in Hammer Lane and Thornton Road 
in north Stockton, Cali.

2:11 p.m. - A bank guard alerts police before being restrained

2:12 p.m. - Police arrive on the scene

2:16 p.m. - The thieves make off with three hostages in a bank employees green SUV. They make it 14 blocks before shooting one.

2:28 p.m. - The thieves pull off the highway in an attempt to ambush pursuing officers but are foiled when authorities spot them

3:16 p.m. - They shoot the second hostage

3:18 p.m. - Police are able to shoot out the SUV's tires bringing it to a halt in the middle of an intersection

3:20 - The thieves exit the SUV using hostage Misty Holt-Singh as a human shield. She's killed in the crossfire along with two of the thieves.

They took three female hostages in total - two bank employees and Holt-Singh -
 from the building at gunpoint, before stealing one of their SUVs and driving away at approximately 2:16 p.m..

CBS Sacramento reports that her as-yet-unnamed 12-year-old daughter was left left stranded at the bank as her mother was taken hostage.

Police tell Mail Online they have yet to confirm the exact amount of money the robbers escaped with.

The thieves only went 14 blocks before shooting one of the hostages who was then either pushed from the truck or jumped. Doctors say her injuries are not life threatening.

For the next 45 minutes, the robbers 
led dozens of police cars on a chase across highways and city streets, 
according to Stockton police Officer Joe Silva.

The robbers not only had assault rifles but extra magazines taped or strapped to their bodies.

Police lost the SUV at approximately 2:28 p.m. as it pulled off the highway. However, rather than using the advantage to speed away the thieves stopped in position to ambush the police they knew were just seconds away.

Luckily for authorities, another officer saw them from another angle and warned the pursuing officers.

The second employee was shot at 3:16 p.m., shortly before she either jumped from the car or was pushed. She is expected to survive, The Los Angeles Times reports.

Finally at 3:18 p.m. the police were able to shoot out the SUV's tires and bring it to a halt in the middle of an intersection.

They used Holt-Singh, their final hostage, as a human shield in a final shootout. She was tragically killed in the crossfire.

'These
 suspects wanted no part of a peaceful resolution,' said Police Chief Eric Jones. 

14 police cars were shot during the pursuit before the SUV's tires could be shot out

The suspects fired AK-47-style rifles from the windows of their SUV during the deadly pursuit

The only surviving suspect has been identified as Jaime Ramos, 19, of Stockton

He added: 'It was such a chaotic ... fluid 
situation, really one of the most dangerous, tense situations that a 
police officer could go through.

'The firing never stopped. They were 
trying to kill (the officers), no doubt. There was a lot on the line and
 the officers responded appropriately.'

One
 suspect was declared dead at the scene, while the second and third were
 taken to hospital with gunshot wounds, according to News10.

Stockton police spokesman Joe Silva 
said Thursday morning the men, ages 30 and 27, were Stockton residents.

He identified the third and surviving suspect as 19-year-old Jaime Ramos
 and said Ramos was booked into San Joaquin County Jail on suspicion of 
homicide, kidnapping, robbery and attempted murder.

In total, the robbers shot 14 police 
cars and a still undetermined number of homes during the chase.

'I can't believe this' wrote another. 'RIP misty.'

'This is not something you want to hear in the middle of the day,' brother-in-law Ajit Singh told reporters. 'You

Today, witnesses said the final shoot-out had resembled a warzone.

'It sounded like five minutes of straight gunfire,' witness Sam York told KCRA-TV. 'It seemed like it wasn't real.'

Jose Maldonado, who said he saw the robbers taking the women out of the bank, said the men had rifles that looked like AK-47s slung over their shoulders.

He added that they had also tied up a bank security guard, and didn't seem to care that there were police all around.

'They were not afraid. They weren't going to take no for an answer. These poor women, they were screaming, they were so distraught, so scared,' he said.

In a statement, the bank said it would not provide information about the victims.

'This is a tragic incident and we are focused on supporting our customers and employees,' it said.
