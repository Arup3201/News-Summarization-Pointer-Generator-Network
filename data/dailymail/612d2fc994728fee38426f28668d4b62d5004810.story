Newcastle United have given an insight into what goes on in a Premier League dressing room prior to a match.

The Magpies travelled to White Hart Lane to play Tottenham on Sunday afternoon, and in a Vine posted on the club's official Twitter account, fans were shown around the away dressing room before the players arrived to begin their preparations. 

The video showed a table piled high with players' drinks and snacks, as well as a strangely high volume of toilet roll.

From the table, the players will tuck into specially designed £1.29 SiS GO isotonic gels - in pink grapefruit and blackcurrant flavours - as well as mixed seed energy bars and oat and honey flavour Nature Valley snack bars.

The isotonic gels, made by Science in Sport, provide a quick supply of energy to the player's muscles and is designed to help the team work harder, for longer, during the match.

And it seems to have worked, given that the Magpies came away from White Hart Lane with a 1-2 victory.  

There was just one carton of Brake's '100% Juice', apple flavour, and twenty packs of spearmint chewing gum for the players to enjoy.

As with the majority of professional football clubs, the players were free to take Lucozade Sport drinks - orange flavour - as well as a supermarket own brand blue isotonic drink, which will have been picked up for 40p a piece.

Alongside the piles of toilet roll, there were tork rolls, as well as Vicks VapoRub to aid the players' breathing during the match, and soothe aches and pains.
