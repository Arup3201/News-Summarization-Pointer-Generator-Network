A British man on a dream sailing trip to the Caribbean to celebrate his wife’s 60th birthday was shot dead by robbers who boarded the yacht and attacked the couple.

Roger Pratt, 62, is believed to have been shot dead as he defended his wife Margaret from the gang of thieves in  St Lucia.

The couple were half way through a year-long sailing trip to celebrate her milestone birthday when the yachting adventure ended in tragedy.

It emerged last night that they had been forced to stay the night in the port of Vieux Fort after being denied clearance to leave by customs officials.

Local police spokesman Anel Innocent said Mr Pratt was beaten up and shot after three armed men boarded the boat on Friday night.

Officers were said to have then killed one of the suspects in a dramatic shoot-out which followed the murder, and arrested the suspects.

Mr Pratt was rushed to hospital but died from his injuries. His wife was also taken to hospital with cuts and bruises and was later discharged. Detectives were understood to have taken a statement from her yesterday afternoon.

Mr Innocent said yesterday: ‘We do not know the full facts about this case yet. We are trying to ascertain what happened and then to get to the bottom of it.'

‘We can however confirm that the man died and that we will be conducting a full post-mortem examination which will reveal the cause of death.’

Just days earlier, the couple had celebrated Mrs Pratt’s 60th birthday with a meal out at a restaurant. They had posted pictures of their expedition around the Caribbean in an online blog to keep family and friends updated on their trip.

The couple were keen sailors and had spent years planning their 12-month trip across the Atlantic and around the Caribbean. Before leaving the UK in July last year, Mrs Pratt wrote on her LinkedIn page: ‘Off travelling! The plan is to be in the Carribean for my 60th birthday in January 2014 .  .  . all a bit of a leap into the unknown.’

They had been in St Lucia since mid-December and were planning to leave the island on Thursday but could not get clearance from the customs authorities.

Instead, they were forced to spend the night in Vieux Fort.

In her latest blog entry, written just hours before her husband’s death, Mrs Pratt bemoaned local bureaucracy.

She wrote: ‘So here we are in Vieux Fort, the most southerly port of clearance in St Lucia. 

‘It’s very different.  There’s a port; an airport and no tourists – and so it’s a regular town. It’s determinedly normal. It has a lot of churches: I counted seven and is different from the Catholic north. It seemed more wealthy, and of course isn’t reliant on tourist bucks.’

Mr and Mrs Pratt ran their own financial consultancy business, Okra Associates, based in Cannock, Staffordshire.

Mrs Pratt also held a series of high-profile jobs in the NHS, including chief executive and director of finance roles.

They lived together in a large £700,000 detached home in the historic village of Moreton Morrell in rural Warwickshire.

A spokesman for the Foreign and Commonwealth Office said: ‘We are aware of the death of a British National in St Lucia.

‘We are providing consular assistance to the family.’

In the affluent hamlet of Moreton Paddox near Stratford-on-Avon where the couple had lived neighbours spoke of their horror at what had happened.

Lavinia O'Shaughnessy, who has known the couple 15 years, said: 'I just feel really upset because for something like that to happen to people who are so very nice is terrible - I wanted them to come back.'

She added: 'They were going on a journey on their boat, sailing around the world.

'Roger wasn't about much because he was retired so he would be down on the Isle of Wight where it was moored at the time, getting it ready for their trip.

'They rented their house out a few months ago, then went off sailing.'

Mrs O'Shaughnessy said: 'Margaret was very friendly - she'd pick me up at the end of the road to give me a lift into town if she saw me, she was that sort of person.

'She was very into her work.

'I miss her really, and I'm very sorry to hear about Roger.'
