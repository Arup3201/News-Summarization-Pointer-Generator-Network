A student who was told he was too fat to join the Army has shed five stone - and has finally been able to follow his lifelong dream and sign up.

Declan Whiting, 19, was desperate to 
join the 4th Batallion The Yorkshire Regiment, but was crushed after he 
was turned away after tipping the scales at 18 stone.

But Declan, from Hull, East Yorks, pledged to battle the bulge head on and after hitting the gym, has now shed five stone in just nine months and has finally been accepted into the forces.

The teen even turned up at the TA 
centre once a month for a weigh in so that army bosses could see he was 
serious about joining.

And he has finally been allowed to sign up after tipping the scales at just 13 stone.

Declan, who is studying information 
and communications technology at sixth form college, said: 'I used to be
a couch potato but I now do regular weight training at the gym and go 
jogging in my local park.

'When
I turned up at the TA Centre to enquire about joining, I knew they 
would mention my weight - I was well aware I was overweight.

'They were really nice about it, and offered me loads of advice on exercise and what I should be doing to lose the weight.

Declan hit the gym and started eating smaller portions of the food he loved

'They weren't allowed to advise me on diet, but I went on the British Army website and looked up loads of tips.

'I have changed my diet, but only in terms of the calorie intake.

''I certainly don't starve myself. I eat exactly the same food as I did before, just not in excess.

'If you work out the maintenance 
calories you require each day and just eat less than that you will lose 
weight.

'I didn't follow any faddy celebrity diet, it's just common 
sense.'

Declan, who stands at 5ft 10in, had been an Army Cadet for three years when he was at school, but put on weight when he left.

He added: 'When I was younger, I wasn't that heavy, but I was big for my age.

'I gave up playing rugby and left the cadets, I started to put on the pounds and it just got out of hand.'

Declan, whose brother Paul, 29, serves
with the Royal Logistic Corps in Germany, decided to enlist with 4 
Yorks after missing the camaraderie of the Army Cadet Force.

Sergeant Kalvin Neal, who monitored 
Declan's weight loss over the nine-month period, said Private Whiting 
had wanted to get into the infantry for a long time.

Sgt Neal said: 'Declan had been in the Army Cadets before that so he knew exactly what it entailed.

'Private Whiting has been an ideal candidate and has put a lot of effort into joining this battalion.

'He has shown great commitment, has kept in touch with the unit and remained positive about the whole recruitment process.

'He got a great report from his selection weekend. I wish I could get more recruits like him.'
