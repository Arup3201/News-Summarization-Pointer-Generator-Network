A man who bludgeoned his wife to death with an ornamental elephant was yesterday jailed for life.

Devendra Singh, 33, will serve at least 16 years in prison after he was convicted of murdering his 41-year-old wife Charlotte Smith.

He repeatedly ‘smashed and shattered’ her skull after she demanded a divorce, using force described by a pathologist as ‘beyond the scale’.

Murder: Charlotte Smith, right, was bludgeoned to death by her husband Devendra Singh, left, in September

After the attack Singh left the body lying on the lounge floor.

He then threw evidence – including 
the 4lb wooden elephant – over their garden fence into a field before 
fleeing the home near Leek, Staffordshire.

Stafford Crown Court heard Singh 
travelled to London, but put his wife’s SIM card into his phone so he 
could pose as her, sending reassuring text messages to her family and 
friends.

However her family discovered her body three days after she was killed last September.

Singh later handed himself in to 
police and admitted killing his wife, but denied murder on the basis 
that he suffered a ‘loss of control’.

Weapon: The killer picked up this ornamental elephant and used it to attack his estranged wife

During the five-day trial pathologist
Olaf Biedrzycki said Miss Smith’s injuries were among the worst he had 
seen during his 20-year career.

He told the jury: ‘There were an 
awful lot of fractures to the front of the skull, and I could feel a lot
of fractures to the face. The degree of force used to inflict the 
injuries is of an extreme nature.

‘It is one of the most severe head injury cases I have come across.’

Detective Inspector Glyn Pattinson, 
who led the inquiry for Staffordshire Police, said: ‘There is no doubt 
that Singh’s attack was brutal and sustained.’

Miss Smith, who worked as a health 
and safety manager, met Singh during a family holiday to Goa in 2008. 
They decided to get married in December 2010 and, after waiting for a 
visa, Singh moved from India to the UK.

When he struggled to find work, the Smith family even opened a shop in the town centre for him to run.

But prosecutors said by last summer the relationship was failing, and Singh had become prone to heavy drinking and aggression.

Miss Smith, who was known as Charlie,
told work colleagues her husband had grabbed her around the neck during
an argument just four months before she died.

Speaking after the sentencing, her 
parents, Irene Cork and Peter Smith, said: ‘No matter what length of 
sentence is served to him nothing will compensate for our loss.

‘Some years from now he will leave prison and be free to continue with his life. For Charlie there is nothing.

‘Losing Charlie will continue to affect us for the rest of our lives.'
