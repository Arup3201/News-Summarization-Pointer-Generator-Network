Nelson Mandela's condition is improving after treatment for pneumonia and a 'restful' day in a hospital yesterday, the South African Government said.

Prayers were being offered across the world for the 94-year-old former President and anti-apartheid leader who is due to spend his sixth consecutive night in hospital.

It is his third hospital visit since December after already having treatment for gallstones and a lung infection.

Improving: Nelson Mandela spect a 'restful' day in hospital yesterday after doctors cleared fluid from his lungs after the former president had a recurrence of pneumonia

The office of President Jacob Zuma 
thanked South Africans who prayed for 94-year-old Mandela at Easter 
church services this weekend, as well as people at home and around the 
world who showed their 'love and support in various ways' for the 
anti-apartheid leader and his family.

'We also thank foreign governments for their messages of support,' Zuma's office said in a statement.

The
government 'is satisfied that the doctors are providing the former 
president with the best medical care possible to enable his recovery and
comfort.

They have reported a further improvement in his condition,' the statement said.

Nelson Mandela is said to be breathing 'without difficulty' after having a procedure to clear fluid in his lung

Mandela
was admitted to a Pretoria hospital near midnight Wednesday. It was his
third trip to a hospital since December, when he was treated for a lung
infection and also had a procedure to remove gallstones.

Earlier in March, he spent a night in a hospital for what officials said was a scheduled medical test.

'The
whole world must come together and pray for him,' Zacheus Phakathi, a 
security guard, said Sunday at an outdoor service on a hill overlooking 
Johannesburg.

The legendary statesman's 
granddaugther Ndileka Mandela thanked people for their prayers saying: 
''This fortifies me as a person as his grandchild to give me strength to
carry on supporting Madiba in the way he needs'.

Mr Mandela is often referred to in South Africa by his Xhosa clan name of Madiba.

In Pretoria, the capital, Henry Hyar,
a restaurant waiter, standing by a hospital where Mandela is believed 
to be, said it was unfortunate that Mandela could not be with his family
at home during Easter.

'I'm not happy about it,' Hyar said. 'We're praying for him to get better as soon as possible.' On
Saturday, Zuma's office reported that Mandela was breathing without 
difficulty after having a procedure to clear fluid in his lung area.

Mandela became South Africa's first 
black president in 1994 after elections were held, bringing an end to 
the system of white racist rule known as apartheid.

After his release 
from prison in 1990, Mandela was widely credited with averting even 
greater bloodshed by helping the country in the transition to democratic
rule.

The Nobel Peace Prize laureate has 
been particularly vulnerable to respiratory problems since contracting 
tuberculosis during his 27-year imprisonment for fighting white racist 
rule in his country.

The elderly are especially vulnerable
to pneumonia, which can be fatal. Its symptoms include fever, chills, a
cough, chest pain and shortness of breath. Many germs cause pneumonia.

The office of President Jacob Zuma has said doctors were acting with extreme caution because of the Mandela's advanced age.

Mr Mandela has spent much of last year in Qunu, his ancestral village in the poor Eastern Cape province.

But since his release from hospital 
in December he has been at his home in an affluent Johannesburg suburb, 
close to sophisticated medical care.

Fondly called the ‘father of the nation’, Mr Mandela has been mostly absent from the political scene for the past decade. But he remains an enduring symbol of the struggle against racism.
