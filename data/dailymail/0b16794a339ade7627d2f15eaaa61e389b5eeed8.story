Mortgages are now the cheapest on record, new figures show.

Two-year fixed and variable rate mortgages have plummeted to new lows as lenders try to attract borrowers.

Banks and buildings societies are trying to lure in new buyers after demand fell in the last half of the year.

Tough new lending rules which make it harder for some borrowers to obtain a mortgage have dampened the market in recent months.

Fears of an imminent hike in interest rates also deterred buyers, as many waited to find out if the Bank of England would raise its base from an historic low of 0.5 per cent before moving.

But with the Bank of England not due to raise its base rate until the end of this year – or even 2016 – lenders are making up for lost time and now offering rock bottom offers.

Experts said now could be one of the best times in history to lock into a fixed rate mortgage at a cheap price before rates rise.

The average interest rate for a two-year fixed rate home loan with at least a 25 per cent deposit  was just 2.08 per cent in December, the lowest level since records began in 1995.

This deal, which is the most common loan type taken out by borrowers, fell from 2.17 per cent a month earlier.

Interest rates on a two-year variable with a discount have also never been lower at 1.63 per cent, down from 1.81 per cent a month before. And lifetime trackers are also near record lows at 2.86 per cent, the figures showed.

Global bank Citi said the figures showed that ‘key mortgage rates generally continued to fall in December, and many mortgage rates now are at or around record lows’.

Sylvia Waycot, of the financial website Moneyfacts, said: ‘Mortgage lenders are now fighting for our attention.

Demand for mortgages was reported to have ‘decreased significantly’ in the last quarter of 2014, according to the Bank of England (File photo) 

‘Almost daily new deals are being launched as each lender tries to out-do its competitor – which at last is some great news for the borrower.’

Demand for mortgages was reported to have ‘decreased significantly’ in the last quarter of 2014, according to the Bank of England.

This was partly due to the mortgage market review, which forced lenders to check that borrowers could afford to meet their monthly repayments in the event of interest rate rises.

Banks now have to carry out rigorous checks on potential buyers’ spending habits before they agree to grant them a home loan, which has apparently led to fewer approvals.
