Police investigating the death of a teenage gymnast in a car crash have arrested her boyfriend on suspicion of dangerous driving.

Former child model Claudia Ella Williams, 19, was killed as her boyfriend Rick Bromley 20, was driving them to her grandmother's house after a family dinner in a pub.

Miss Willams, a gymnast for the Welsh national squad, was pronounced dead at the scene after the silver Vauxhall Corsa hit a tree in the village of Guilden Sutton, Cheshire, while Bromley escaped with minor bruising.

Claudia Williams, 19, died when a car driven by her boyfriend Rick Bromley, 20, hit a tree after a family dinner

She and her boyfriend had been out for dinner at the Old Trooper pub in 
Christleton, outside Chester, with her father Nigel and two younger sisters aged 17, and 
10.

At 9.40pm Miss Williams, who modelled as a toddler, and Bromley were driving through the countryside east of Chester when the car veered off the 
road and hit a tree on the passenger side of the vehicle.

Shortly after the accident on June 24, Miss Williams' family publicly vowed to support Bromley, describing the couple as 'inseparable'.

This week, however, he was detained and questioned on suspicion of causing death by dangerous driving.  He has now been freed on bail pending further inquiries.

Miss Williams, who lived with her mother Andrea in Hoole, Chester, was studying travel and tourism at West Cheshire College in Ellesmere Port and working as a hotel waitress in her spare time.

She began dating Bromley last year, and he had been living with her and her mother for six months before she died.

Last week Miss Williams' parents spoke of their devastation at losing a daughter they described as a 'princess who lived life to the full'.

Her mother told the Chester Chronicle: 'We are going to miss her so much - our lives will never be the same without her.

'She’ll be forever in our hearts and always live on with us in our memories. Rick lived here for six months. They were inseparable and hadn’t spent a night apart in six months.'

'She loved socialising, living life to the full and having a good time. She competed for the Welsh national gymnastic squad and got to travel all over the world competing in gymnastics.

'Claudia spent all her time with her friends and Rick. She was best friends with her grandma and would spend a few nights with her gran and Rick.'

Miss Williams' father, Nigel, added: 'Claudia loved history and anything to do with archaeology.

'She loved to look immaculate all the time and was just happy with life.  We’d like to give our support to Rick and his family who have always been lovely.'

Her aunt Janene said: 'She was was a very, very bright child. Claudia’s ambition was to be graceful and beautiful and get married and settle down and have children. She was a lady.

'She was very family-orientated. The time she thrived the most was when all of her family were together. She would organise and plan and do shopping lists to get the family together.'

A spokesman for West Cheshire College described Miss Williams as 'a delight to teach and an excellent team player', and her former headmaster at Christleton High School said she was a happy and popular student.
