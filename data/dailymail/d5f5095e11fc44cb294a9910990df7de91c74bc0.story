A violent man has been caught on CCTV attacking estate agent staff in a row over a £100 deposit despite never having been a customer at the branch.

Three women were left terrified when the unknown man burst into Lovett International letting agents in Bournemouth, Dorset and shouted and screamed obscenities at them before throwing everything off one of the desks.

The same man is also said to have shouted at workers at a different branch two weeks earlier, with staff reporting both incidents to the police and sending them CCTV footage of the incident.

The violent man approaches the front door of Lovett International letting agents in Bournemouth, leaving his bike in the entrance 

He then bursts through the door and begins to shout and scream obscenities at the terrified staff behind their desks  

But despite 10 phone calls and emails sent over the course of a week, officers have still not responded to the complaint and have been forced to apologise for their lack of action.

Maximillian De Kment, who runs the agency said the enraged man is not a client and believes he has mistaken his business with another firm the man has an ongoing complaint with.

He said that since the attacks, his staff have now resorted to keeping the door locked and fear the man could come back, possibly with a weapon.

He explained: 'He used a lot of swear words but in between those he seemed to have a beef that someone had stolen his £100 deposit.

The then starts pointing as his aggressive rant in the office in Bournemouth continues 

The whole incident was captured on the shop's CCTV cameras but despite informing the police, they are yet to respond to the complaint 

'He's obviously got muddled up in some way. None of the staff recognised him.

'The first incident there were five fairly robust gentlemen there and he quickly darted out the door.

'The second incident happened at an office containing three female employees.

'We've got perfect CCTV footage but the police aren't even interested in that.

'My fear is that everything could escalate if the police don't deal with it and caution him.

'Next time he might come in with a knife. What's the point of the police dealing with it then when I've got a fatality on my hands?

After ranting at the staff over a £100 deposit, the man then leans forward towards one staff member's desk 

He then throws all of the items off desk as the three female staff members look on in horror 

'People like that need to be cautioned to prevent a much larger action in the future.

'I emailed the police four times, which we still haven't had a response to, and we also called. The staff called at least five times and I called four or five times as well.

'We have the doors locked on a permanent basis now and I'm having to install specialist buttons on the desks so staff can buzz people they recognise in.

'But it's not the image you want of the trade. It's just not right.

'I've done everything I can for the security of my staff. In my other shop there's five different camera positions. It might seem over the top for a shop that doesn't handle cash but I've done that for my staff.

After the rant, the man walks out of the shop. It is believed his complaint is with another letting agents in the area 

'I've bought expensive CCTV so the footage can be passed on to the police and investigated but half my plan seems to be falling down.'

Inspector Alan Setchell, of Dorset police, explained that the incident had wrongly been down-graded by staff which is why it was not immediately investigated.

He said: 'An officer did call back to explain that we were unable to attend straight away and that someone would be round as soon as possible.

'The incident was mistakenly then reclassified as a lower priority which resulted in a slow response due to officer availability and the number of incidents that had been classified at a higher priority level.

'We clearly let them down on this occasion and I would like to apologise to Mr De Kment and staff at the two addresses for any distress this has caused.'
