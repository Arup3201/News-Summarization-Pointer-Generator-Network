The sisters of the hiker who was immortalized by the film Into The Wild have said his journey was an escape from his traumatic childhood.  

Chris McCandless  left his California family home and set out across the American West and into Alaska.

Four months after he reached Alaska in 1992, the 24-year-old's body was found by hunters in an abandoned bus, 30 miles away from the nearest town. It is believed he died of starvation, potentially after becoming ill from the seeds he was eating to survive.

Many believe his story, that was the basis for the 2007 movie, was inspired by his love of nature.

But according to ABC in a new memoir The Wild Truth written by his sister Carine, she reveals a troubled upbringing that involved his father beating his mother and getting two women pregnant at the same time.

The Wild Truth: In a new memoir written by his sister Carine, she reveals a troubled upbringing that involved Chris McCandless' father beating his mother and getting two women pregnant at the same time

Walt McCandless, Chris' father, started having children with Billie. However he was still having children with his first wife, Marcia, at the time. 

The former NASA rocket scientist was still married to Marcia and dividing his time between the two families - one with Billie, Chris, and Carine and another with Marcia and their six children, including Shelly and Shawna.

Walt and Marcia divorced when Chris was four-years-old. Carine said her and Chris knew they had half-siblings and sometimes would spend time with them.

The sisters say their father was controlling and domineering, with a very short temper that turned into angry, verbal outbursts and attacks on Marcia and Billie, with pushing and shoving.

Shelly McCandless, who lived with Chris and Carine her senior year of high school, said 'There was a lot of choking and shoving.'

Carine McCandless said: 'We would hear raised voices, and it would get louder and louder, and Chris would usually come and grab me and get me outside of the house.

'We would hear my mom say, "Kids, kids, Come look what your father is doing to me," and then he would scream right after, "kids, get in here now, look what your mother is making me do".'

She then described how her father would throw her down on the bed and be choking her. In between each breath, she claims she would scream for help.

When he let go, the pair's mother would run over and hug both of them, saying: 'I'm sorry, kids. But when I got pregnant with Chris, I got stuck with your Dad.' 

In one incident, Carine described how her father directed the violence at Chris.

She told the station: 'Dad just hauled off and punched him right on the spin, and Chris just turned and looked to him and [had a] puff of disgust across his lips, and I saw this fear come across my father's face, and Chris just turned around and walked away.'

ABC News obtained a copy of a restraining order Marcia filed in 1972 against Walt

She said that he had 'struck' her in the arm and face, that he 'threatened' her many times, occasions and that she 'feared for her safety.'

In a statement to ABC News addressing Carine McCandless' book, Walt and Billie McCandless said: '[This] fictionalized writing has absolutely nothing to do with our beloved son, Chris, his journey or his character.

'This whole unfortunate event in Chris' life 22 years ago is about Chris and his dreams.' 

The last time the sisters saw Chris was when he was celebrating college graduation. He wrote a letter, that will be revealed in an upcoming PBS documentary about his life, explaining why he wanted to go. Carine does not believe that it was his intention to die.
