Two senior Northern Ireland policeman were murdered by the IRA following a tip-off to the terrorists from the Irish police, an inquiry has found.

Chief Superintendent Harry Breen and Superintendent Bob Buchanan were gunned down on March 20 1989 near the border in south Armagh shortly after a meeting in Dundalk Garda station.

Inquiry chief Judge Peter Smithwick said he was ‘satisfied there was collusion in the murders’.

The inquiry found an unidentified IRA mole leaked information about the movements of Mr Breen and Mr Buchanan on the day they were killed.

No direct evidence of collusion was uncovered.

The IRA are thought to have been tipped off at about 11.30 on the morning of the ambush by the IRA mole in Dundalk station.

But Judge Smithwick has not ruled out a second act of collusion by the same, or possibly a different, member of the Garda that day.

He said it is likely a mole confirmed the officers had arrived in the station.

On their way home on the Edenappa Road near Jonesborough, just a few hundred yards over the border, a van with a gang of up to six armed IRA men cut them off.

Both policemen were in civilian clothes and neither was carrying a weapon.

Mr Buchanan tried to reverse the red Vauxhall Cavalier out of danger but got stuck in a ditch and was shot several times in the driver’s seat.

Mr Breen tried to surrender. He got out of the car, walked to the front of it with his hands up and was shot several times.

As well as confirming long-held suspicions of the IRA mole in Dundalk, the judge accused Garda chiefs of trying to undermine a retired superintendent who testified that he passed intelligence on the Buchanan death threat to the highest ranks.

‘The integrity of and confidence in An Garda Siochana can properly be maintained only if suggestions of inappropriate or illegal conduct by members are taken seriously, transparently and thoroughly investigated and, above all, not tolerated or ignored on the basis of some misguided sense of loyalty to the force or to its members,’ he said.

William Buchanan, son of the murdered RUC officer, said it was incredible and shocking to think his father had effectively been set up to be murdered.

The Breen family said their respected RUC husband and father had been betrayed by his police counterparts in the Republic.

Tanaiste Eamon Gilmore, Ireland’s Foreign Affairs Minister, apologised to the families and said the country must confront the grave findings.

‘I am appalled and saddened by this finding. It is a matter of grave public concern,’ he said.

Unionist politicians said the tribunal will have major implications for how the past is dealt with while Northern Ireland Secretary Theresa Villiers said she would raise the findings with the Irish Government.
