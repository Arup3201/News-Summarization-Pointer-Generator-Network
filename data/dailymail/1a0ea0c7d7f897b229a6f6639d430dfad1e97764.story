A British hostage was executed by Islamist  kidnappers moments after UK Special Forces launched a rescue mission in Nigeria, an inquest heard.

Construction worker Chris McManus, 28, was shot six times as he sought refuge in a toilet while the Special Boat Service joined Nigerian soldiers in a battle to save his life.

His Italian colleague, Franco Lamolinara, 48, was also killed in the raid last March. The pair had been held for ten months.

Yesterday’s inquest was told that the 
hostages had been killed ‘fairly quickly into the engagement’, which was
authorised by David Cameron due to mounting concerns over the men’s 
safety.

Mr McManus, a quantity surveyor from Oldham, had been living in a
heavily-guarded compound in the city of Birnin-Kebbi, previously 
considered safe by his employer, construction company B.Stabilini.

However, on May 12, 2011, the Salford University graduate was abducted 
at gunpoint from his apartment. Mr Lamolinara was seized at the same 
time.

After months in captivity, intelligence emerged that the men were being 
held in Sokoto, around 100 miles from where they were snatched.

British 
Special Forces were deployed to the area and on March 8 last year, Cobra
– the Government’s emergency response committee – approved the rescue 
mission.

Just 45 minutes later, seven UK troops supported by Nigerians burst into
the compound to be met by a hail of gunfire, Wiltshire and Swindon 
Coroner’s Court was told.

Troops began a search and found a room with barred windows containing 
two beds and a Manchester United shirt similar to one Mr McManus wore in
a hostage video.

Detective Chief Inspector Grant Mallon, who investigated the shootings, 
said: ‘There was a metal door to a toilet and they noticed there were 
bullet holes.

‘The door was partially open and when the soldiers looked inside they 
could see two white males on the floor. Both men had visible gunshot 
wounds. It appears they were killed fairly quickly into the engagement.’

A post-mortem found Mr McManus died ‘almost immediately’ from a single shot to the head. He suffered five other gunshot wounds.

Coroner David Ridley said the construction worker appeared to have been 
hiding inside the toilet when the rescue mission started, but was shot 
through the door.

He recorded a verdict of unlawful killing.

The failed mission sparked a diplomatic row. The Italian president said 
it was ‘inexplicable’ that Downing Street had not alerted Rome in 
advance, but Foreign Secretary William Hague said this was impossible 
because of the danger to the captives.

Mr McManus’s family paid tribute to the military personnel who ‘risked 
their lives to rescue Chris from the compound’, and insisted ministers 
were right to order the raid.

His mother Laura said: ‘We accept that the decisions reached and taken 
by the authorities were the only ones possible based on the information 
available.

'Chris cannot be hurt any more. We and all those who loved him
will always remember the way he lived and not the way he died.’
