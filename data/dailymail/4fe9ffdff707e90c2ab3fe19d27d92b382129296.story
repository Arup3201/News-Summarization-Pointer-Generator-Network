A video allegedly showing Mohamed Al Alami's funeral was posted online last week

A former Guantanamo Bay prisoner who fought against British and US forces in Afghanistan has been killed while fighting for Al Qaeda in Syria.

Mohammed Al Alami was released from the top-security detention centre in 2006 after convincing officials that he was no longer a threat to the West.

The 37-year-old, who spent four years in custody, claimed he confessed to being a terrorist only after being beaten and threatened with death.

But it has now been revealed that he was killed last month while fighting for Al Nusra Front, one of the most violent and ruthless Islamic groups in Syria.

A video posted on YouTube last week showed a funeral in which Alami is praised by a rebel leader for enduring ‘the prison of the Americans in  Guantanamo... where he did not reform or change’.

The disclosure will further fuel concerns that Britain and the United States should not become embroiled in Syria’s civil war, in which Al Qaeda-affiliated groups are playing an increasingly prominent role, with hundreds of rebel fighters reportedly defecting to them.

Western intelligence agencies including MI6 and the CIA fear that any weapons sent to bring down the regime of Syrian dictator Bashar Al-Assad could used to attack the West in the future.

One official said last night that, in addition to the defections, Syria had experienced a ‘massive influx’ of  Islamists seeking jihad in recent months.

The official added: ‘Volunteers have come from Chechnya, Iraq, Tunisia, Libya, Saudi Arabia, Australia and even Britain.

We are now seeing in-fighting between various rebel groups and the Islamists may soon become the dominant force.’

Moroccan-born Alami confessed to fighting against US and British Special Forces in Afghanistan shortly after the September 11 attacks.

He was captured three months later, following the fall of the Taliban, while attempting to cross into Pakistan.

He was handed over to the CIA before being flown out of Afghanistan, dressed in an orange jumpsuit and manacled to the floor of a US transport aircraft.

During his interrogation, which is believed to have taken place at the covert CIA prison in Bagram airbase, Alami admitted being a  member of Al Qaeda.

The news that an Al Qaeda fighter has been killed will back up campaigners who say there is no need to get involved in Syria's complicated civil war

He said he attended the Al Farouq paramilitary camp in Afghanistan where he saw Osama Bin Laden, who was there ‘to encourage and reinforce the trainees’ commitment to the cause of jihad’.

Along with dozens of other terrorist suspects, Alami was transferred to Guantanamo Bay in February 2002 and was detained at the notorious Camp X-Ray for several weeks before being moved to another detention centre on the same site.

But he later recanted the claim that he had been trained by Al Qaeda and said that he had confessed only after being beaten and threatened.

Pentagon records and documents released via the WikiLeaks website reveal that Alami was released in 2006.

The documents also state that Guantanamo commander Major General Geoffrey Miller opposed the move.

Experts say that former Guantanamo prisoners are viewed as heroes  by Islamist fighters in Syria for  keeping faith in their cause during their detention.

Last night, a White House spokesman said: ‘We are aware of reports that a former Guantanamo detainee has died in the fighting in Syria.’
