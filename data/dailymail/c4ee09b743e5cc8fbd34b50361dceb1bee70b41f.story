Researchers commissioned by Japan's health ministry discovered what they claim as high levels of the chemical formaldehyde in the chemical produced by heating several types of e-cigarette liquid.

Formaldehyde is a substance that occurs naturally in the environment at low levels but is also found at higher levels in certain products such as building materials and embalming fluids. It is classed as a human carcinogen.

E-cigarettes are becoming increasingly popular around the world, particularly among young people. E-cigarettes function by heating flavoured liquid, which often contains nicotine, to produce a vapour that is inhaled, much as the smoke from traditional cigarettes is inhaled.

Supporters of e-cigarettes say the devices are a safer alternative to traditional tobacco, whose bouquet of toxic chemicals and gases can cause cancer, heart disease and strokes 

Dr Naoki Kunugita, of the National Institute of Public Health, Japan, claims that the team found that 'more than 10 times the level of formaldehyde contained in one regular cigarette' were produced by 10 'puffs' of one brand of e-cigarette liquid.

However, that result was not reported in the Japanese study and the amount of formaldehyde detected did vary through the course of analysis. When the wire which vaporises the liquid gets overheated, higher amounts of harmful substances seem to be produced, Dr Kunugita added.

In general, levels of formaldehyde in e-cigarette vapour are up to 50 times lower compared to the levels found in tobacco cigarette smoke; and even the worst case Japanese product tested by the study produced levels of formaldehyde that were six times lower than in traditional cigarette smoke.

In Japan, e-cigarettes are not regulated.

Nicotine e-cigarettes, or so-called Electronic Nicotine Delivery System (ENDS), are subjected to the country's pharmaceutical laws.

Although they are not readily available in shops as they are in the U.S. and Europe, they can be bought easily on the internet.

'You call them e-cigarettes, but they are products totally different from regular tobacco,' the ministry official said.

'The government is now studying the possible risks associated with them, with view to looking at how they should be regulated.'

In August, the World Health Organisation (WHO) called on governments to ban the sale of e-cigarettes to minors, warning they pose a 'serious threat' to unborn babies and young people.

Despite scant research on their effects, the WHO said there was enough evidence 'to caution children and adolescents, pregnant women, and women of reproductive age' about e-cigarette use.

Supporters of e-cigarettes say the devices are a safer alternative to regular tobacco cigarettes, whose combination of toxic chemicals and gases can cause cancer, heart disease and strokes

This was due to the 'potential for foetal and adolescent nicotine exposure (having) long-term consequences for brain development'.

The WHO also said they should be banned from indoor public spaces.

Supporters of e-cigarettes say the devices are a safer alternative to traditional tobacco, whose bouquet of toxic chemicals and gases can cause cancer, heart disease and strokes.

These are known to be among the leading causes of death in many countries.

But opponents say the devices have only been around for a few years, and the long-term health impact from inhaling their vapour is unclear.

Big tobacco companies are snapping up producers of e-cigarettes, wary of missing out on a snowballing global market worth about $3 billion.

Earlier this month, Oxford Dictionaries picked 'vape' - the act of smoking an e-cigarette - as their new word of the year.

 

*  An earlier version of this article stated that Japanese research had found that e-cigarettes contain 10 times more carcinogens than tobacco cigarettes. While the studyconducted by Dr Kunugita, Director of the Japanese Department of Environmental Health, did claim to have found such high levels of one carcinogen (formaldehyde) in the vapour from one brand of electronic cigarette, we would like to clarify that this result was not included in the published research. In fact, the Japanese study supports existing evidence that e-cigarettes are much less dangerous than tobacco products.
