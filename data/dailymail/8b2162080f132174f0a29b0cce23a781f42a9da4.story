David Moyes will take charge of his first training session with Real Sociedad on Wednesday before being officially presented as the Spanish side's new coach.

Moyes was named as the next Sociedad boss late on Monday night - seven months after he was sacked as Manchester United manager.

The Scot, who was axed by United in April following a dismal first season in charge at Old Trafford, has been handed a one-and-a-half-year deal with the Primera Division outfit and is due to land in Spain later on Tuesday.

A Sociedad statement read: 'The new Real Sociedad coach David Moyes will arrive in San Sebastian mid-afternoon, as such it will be the coaches of Sanse (Sociedad's B team) Asier Santana and Imanol Alguacil who will be in charge of the first team for this afternoon's training session.

'David Moyes will take training tomorrow [Wednesday] and then will be officially presented. Full details will be announced later in the day.' Moyes, whose contract with Sociedad runs until June 30, 2016, left United just 10 months into a six-year contract after being named as the successor to Sir Alex Ferguson in the summer of 2013.

At the time of his departure, United, the defending champions, were seventh in the Barclays Premier League and 23 points behind leaders Liverpool.

Moyes also left the 20-time title winners with a host of unwanted records broken during his tenure, including failing to qualify for the Champions League for the first time in almost two decades. 

Sociedad also put up this welcome banner to Moyes on their Twitter page on Monday evening

Moyes, who became the third shortest-serving manager in the club's history, won 27, drew nine and lost 15 of his 51 games in charge of United.

All that came after Moyes had enjoyed 11 critically acclaimed years at Everton, leading the club to five top-six finishes. The Toffees qualified for the Champions League for the first time under Moyes' stewardship - although they lost in the qualifying stages of the competition - and he also took the Merseyside club to the FA Cup final in 2009.

The former Preston boss takes over a Sociedad side who moved out of the Primera Division relegation zone on Sunday night with a 2-1 home win over champions Atletico Madrid.

B team coach Santana was in charge for that match following last week's sacking of Jagoba Arrasate. 

Former West Brom manager Pepe Mel was also in the running for the position in Spain

Arrasate was dismissed in the wake of a hugely disappointing start to the campaign which saw Sociedad - who finished fourth in 2013 and seventh last term - win just one of their opening 10 league fixtures as well as being eliminated from the Europa League.

Ex-West Brom and Real Betis boss Pepe Mel was also in the running to replace Arrasate, but Moyes was reportedly Sociedad's first choice and La Real confirmed the Scot's appointment late on Monday night.

Moyes' first game in charge is set to be the trip to promoted Deportivo La Coruna after the international break.

Moyes becomes the fourth British manager of the San Sebastian-based outfit, following in the footsteps of Englishman Harry Lowe and Welsh duo John Toshack and Chris Coleman. 

VIDEO Moyes returns to management

While in charge at Manchester United last season, Moyes twice faced Sociedad in the Champions League - winning at home and drawing away.

Manchester United 1-0 Real Sociedad (October 24, 2013)

An own goal from Ingo Martinez just two minutes into this Champions League tie at Old Trafford gave United a deserved victory - although they could and should have won by more. 

Sociedad went into the game without a point and Moyes' men ensured they did not get anything from the game - elevating United to the top of Group A.

Real Sociedad 0-0 Manchester United (November 6, 2013)

The return fixture was not as happy for Moyes as United were frustrated in San Sebastian.

Robin van Persie hit the post twice - including from the penalty spot - while Javier Hernandez endured a horrible miss. 

Controversy also took hold of Moyes' team, with Ashley Young appearing to dive to win the penalty before Marouane Fellaini was sent off for a late foul.

Sociedad's previous British managers

Horace Harold (Harry) Lowe, 1930-1935

Lowe was a centre half from Northwich in Cheshire who played for Northwich Victoria, Brighton and Hove Albion, Tottenham and Fulham in the first two decades of the 20th century.

He moved to Spain in 1930 and managed Real Sociedad for five season before leading Espanyol. He died in 1966.

John Toshack, 1985-1989/1991-1994/2001-2002

Welsh legend Toshack managed the club in three separate spells spanning three decades. He led Sociedad to the Copa del Rey in 1987, beating Atletico Madrid on penalties in the final.

He returned to San Sebastian after his season at Real Madrid and then again during the 2001-2002 season.

Chris Coleman, 2007-2008

After Toshack had recommended the job to him, Coleman joined Sociedad, then a second division club, in June 2007. He enjoyed success but fell out with newly-elected president Inaki Badiola and resigned in January 2008 with the club fifth in the table.
