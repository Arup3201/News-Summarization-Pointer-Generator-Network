After more than a decade hanging in  a corridor, a never-before-seen picture of Prince William has emerged on to the art market.

The portrait by distinguished painter John Wonnacott is one of only three canvases of the Prince thought to be in existence.

But what makes the picture so unique is that it is a study of William as a schoolboy and was painted when he was just 17.

It is for that reason that his old school Eton are keen to obtain the painting. If they are successful, they will need deep pockets — or a generous benefactor.

This week, the picture was quietly put up for sale by Agnew’s, the Mayfair art dealers, with a price tag of £120,000. Intriguingly, they are also selling another of Wonnacott’s portraits — this time of the Queen — for £20,000 less.

The story of the 12in-by-9in oil is fascinating. In 1999, Wonnacott began work on a vast canvas of four generations of the Royal Family to mark the Queen Mother’s 100th birthday.

It featured the Queen Mother, the Queen, Prince Philip, Prince Charles, Prince William and Prince Harry. It was so large it had to be completed in five sections and fitted together, but it also involved a huge logistical operation.

Each of the royals sat seven times for the artist but separately. William, who was in his final year at Eton, was painted in his housemaster’s study. To complete the commission, Wonnacott worked on drawings he had made in his studio at Leigh-on-Sea, Essex.

It was from the drawings of William that the artist decided to make a separate painting. ‘I had no plans for it — it just hung in my “royal corridor” at my home,’ Wonnacott tells me. ‘No one knew I had done it.’

It might have remained there had not curators at Agnew’s come to look at some other work.

‘I think I was making them something to eat and they sneaked around to see what else I had got and saw the William picture and said they had to have it,’ Wonnacott says.

Its unique selling point is that it shows William in his Eton tailcoat. Wonnacott recalls: ‘I remember he turned up in some ghastly leopardskin waistcoat and I had to tell him to go and change.’
