A professional boater and married father of three from New Jersey who disappeared last month after his vessel crashed into a jetty may have faked his death to avoid criminal charges, police believe.Â 

Andrew Biddle, 44, was declared missing July 20 after his boat struck a buoy and then crashed into a jetty off the southern tip of Longport. Another passenger, Justin Belz, 23, swam to shore but the Coast Guard was unable to locate Biddle despite searching a 60-mile span for 18 hours.

But this week Egg Harbor Township police Detective Ray
 Theriault put out a law-enforcement-only flier that 
alleges Biddle staged the boating accident and is believed to be 'alive 
and well and on the run.'

Curious: Professional boater Andrew Biddle, pictured left with his business partner, disappeared after his vessel crashed into a jetty last month but police believe he might have faked his death

Mug: Biddle, seen in the mugshot from his arrest on theft and fraud charges, is believed to be running from the law

According to a report on Philly.com, is a manager of Professional Boat Sales in Northfield, which is owned by Tracy Blumenstein.

The pair are facing 13 criminal complaints between them.

Blumenstein was arrested in February on theft and fraud charges.

Biddle faces nine charges in seven complaints, according to The Press of Atlantic City.

Egg Harbor Township police are now considering Biddle a 'wanted person' with 'full U.S. extradition.'

The business partners are professional boaters who have in the past won multiple boat-racing championships together in the U.S. and the UK.

Biddle 'has contacts throughout the country and abroad and could be anywhere,' reads the flier obtained by The Press of Atlantic City.

Theriault said police were 'proceeding with the investigation as we would if he hadn't been reported missing.'

'We have no proof (Biddle is) dead at this point,' he told the newspaper.

According
 to Philly.com, the fact Biddle was so seasoned on the water made his 
crash seem curious to some, especially as he knew the channels where the
 incident took place like the back of his hand.

Witness
 Tom Murphy, who ran into the water to help, said rumors started 
circulating immediately after the collision and he refused to believe 
them.

However, he told Philly.com this week, 'It's starting to sound a little more believable.'

The crash took place around 11.30 p.m. July 20.

Belz,
 whose Facebook page indicates he also works for the boating company, 
was heard by witnesses calling out 'Andy' as he swam to shore in the 
dark and called police.

He was later interviewed by authorities, but no charges have been filed against him.

On the run: This week Egg Harbor Township police Detective Ray Theriault put out a law-enforcement-only flier that alleges Biddle, pictured with his kids, staged the boating accident and is believed to be 'alive and well and on the run'

Family man: Biddle, 44, pictured with his wife, was declared missing July 20 after his boat struck a buoy and then crashed into a jetty off the southern tip of Longport

Missing: Another passenger, Justin Belz, 23, swam to shore but the Coast Guard was unable to locate Biddle, left and right, despite searching a 60-mile span for 18 hours

Search: The Coast Guard searched for more than 60 hours for the boater to no avail

'I am continuing the investigation as if he were still alive,' Detective Ray Theriault told NBC10. 'Given the knowledge I have of what's occurred in the past, it certainly makes me skeptical.'

He added that the boat involved in the collision was in fact stolen by the business he co-owned.

One complaint against Biddle and his partner Blumenstein alleges the pair accepted a $20,000 down payment on a boat but never produced the vessel.

In the days following his disappearance, a page on Facebook was set up praying for Biddle's 'safe return' and had attracted more than 800 'likes.'

However, by Tuesday it was no longer active.
