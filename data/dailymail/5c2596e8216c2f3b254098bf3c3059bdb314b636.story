A former soldier was yesterday found guilty of murdering a schoolgirl nearly 30 years ago in Scotland’s first ‘cold case’ conviction.

Bus driver John Docherty strangled Elaine Doyle yards from her home as she returned from a disco in 1986, and lived a normal life until police reinvestigating the crime knocked on his door two years ago.

Technological advances meant DNA recovered from the 16-year-old’s body was linked to Docherty, who still lived in Greenock, Renfrewshire, less than a mile from the lane where the murder happened.

The father of one agreed to a mouth swab test after the visit from officers working on the cold case inquiry.

It was later found the chances of the DNA belonging to anyone other than Docherty, 49, were around one billion to one.

As he was found guilty after a marathon trial at the High Court in Edinburgh, Elaine’s mother Maureen spoke of her family’s 28-year ‘nightmare’.

Thanking Lord Advocate Frank Mulholland, QC, and police who brought Docherty to justice, Mrs Doyle, 72, of Gourock, Renfrewshire, paid tribute to the ‘people of Inverclyde who have lived this nightmare with us for 28 years and always supported our family’.

Mrs Doyle, a widow, added: ‘The result at court doesn’t make our day-to-day living any easier.

'The pain doesn’t go away but my son John and I take comfort that we now have justice for Elaine, which is all we, especially her dad Jack, campaigned for.’

Docherty, now of Dunoon, Argyll, was found guilty of strangling the teenager after a struggle that tore a clump of hair from her head.

He stripped the terrified girl, or forced her to take off her clothes, in a lane yards from her home in Ardgowan Street, Greenock, on June 2, 1986.

Docherty slipped through the net when detectives apparently simply forgot to question him.

But years later DNA evidence – unknown in crime scene investigations at the time of Elaine’s death – was found on samples taken from her naked body.

Forensic scientist Pauline McSorley said the odds against it belonging to anyone but Docherty were a billion to one, while pathologist Marjorie Turner said evidence pointed to the assailant strangling Elaine from behind.

The majority verdict, after more than four hours, rejected Docherty’s claim that he was at home with his parents in the town’s Anne Street.

The eight women and seven men had heard 52 days of evidence, and hours were spent dealing with the unprecedented defence claim that a list of 41 ‘suspects’ might include the real killer.

Besides Elaine, who had a part-time job as a jeweller’s assistant, and her friends at the Celtic Club disco, was Docherty.

He was with John Faller, who told police Docherty had been with him. Police failed to go straight to Docherty to confirm the story.

As forensic scientists refined techniques for extracting DNA from crime scene samples, they returned to the tape pressed against Elaine’s body in the hope of trapping tell-tale fibres.

Docherty has been remanded in custody to await sentencing in Glasgow in August

Finally, in March 2006, persistence paid off but the microscopic result did not match any likely suspects whose DNA was held on any UK database.

Operation Evergreen was launched and police sought DNA samples from all the men in the investigation files.

By May 2012, they had traced Docherty, an ex-Royal Engineer who had returned to Greenock. He  willingly took the mouth swab test that gave police their breakthrough. 

Another vital link in the chain came when a key witness, Martin Brown, looked at photos taken to his London home.

Mr Brown, now 52, had described a man with staring, angry eyes he had seen with a girl near Ardgowan Street at around the time Elaine might have been there.

He told detectives in September 2012 a photo, culled from Docherty’s Army ID card, reminded him of the fleeting encounter 26 years earlier.

Docherty did not give evidence but his defence team attacked the police investigation. Even senior officers leading the murder hunt admitted in court there were shortcomings.

The so-called mistakes began with an act of compassion when a police blanket was draped over Elaine to shield her body from onlookers.

Defence QC Donald Findlay claimed the scene had been so contaminated the DNA evidence was not reliable.

Judge Lord Stewart told jurors although they had heard criticism of the early investigation, ‘extraordinary persistence, skill and determination’ had brought the case to court.

He told Docherty the only sentence for murder was life but called for a background report.

Docherty was remanded in custody to await sentencing in Glasgow in August.

As he left court, Elaine’s brother John Doyle, 49, said: ‘The jury returned the right decision. I always knew John Docherty was guilty.’

Detective Superintendent Bobby Hendren of Police Scotland said the ‘senseless murder of Elaine has cast a long shadow over Greenock’.

The conviction is a major success for a specialist unit set up by the Crown Office in June 2011 to help crack ‘cold cases’.

Describing the work of the new unit, Mr Mulholland said 93 unsolved murders dating back to 1974 would come under scrutiny.

The Elaine Doyle murder was the first case to go to trial following an investigation by the new Crown Office cold case unit.

It was launched in 2011, with law chief Lord Advocate Frank Mulholland, QC, vowing to snare killers who had evaded justice for years.

He said the specialist team would use new forensic science techniques – including those related to DNA, ballistics and fingerprint databases – to determine which cases merited fresh investigation.

He said: ‘We won’t give up and will seek to identify perpetrators using new forensic and other investigation techniques and prosecute them.’

About 70 murders, going back more than 100 years, remain unsolved. High-profile cases include that of banker Alistair  Wilson, 30, shot dead on the doorstep of his home in Nairn in 2004.

Earlier this year, the Crown Office said convicted paedophile Alexander Gartshore – long linked to the disappearance of Moira Anderson, 11, in 1957 – would be prosecuted if he were alive today.

Following a review by the cold case unit, investigators declared he would have been charged over the death of the youngster, who went missing near her home in Coatbridge, Lanarkshire.
