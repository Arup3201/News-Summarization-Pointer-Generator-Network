A Good Samaritan who saved a stranger was surprised to find that he had in fact done it before eight years previously.

Christopher Manacci had stopped to help Gerald Gronowski and his 15-year-old son with their flat tyre, when a truck came hurtling towards them and hit Manacci’s car, blocking both men from harm.

Recovering from the shock, the two men discovered that nurse practitioner Manacci had come to the aid of Mr Gronowski once before, when he had been injured in a fishing accident eight years earlier.

Good Samaritan: Christopher Manacci came to a stranger's aid, only to find out he had already saved him once before

The miraculous event occurred last Saturday when Christopher Manacci had been driving in Auburn Township, Ohio and saw a van by the road struggling with a flat tyre.

‘I dropped my wife off and decided that I’d bring him a can of Fix-a-Flat for his tyre so he could make it to a gas station,’ Mr Manacci told Fox8 News.

Stopping to help them with their broken down car, Mr Manacci had parked his car next to Mr Gronowski's.

The trio had just begun assessing the damage to the tyre when it happened.

Crashed: Christopher Manacci's Lexus was less fortunate

Out of nowhere, a truck came towards the men at high speed and went straight into Mr Manacci’s Lexus.

‘The truck went up on the 
two left wheels and the right wheels were off the ground when it missed 
us by a few feet,’ Mr Gronowski told Cleveland.com.

‘If the truck had not hit the other 
car first it would have hit us. We could have been killed. And if it 
missed us, it could have killed someone else.’

Thanks
to Mr Manacci’s car, no one was hurt in the accident and as the shock 
began to settle Mr Gronowski recalled another incident eight years 
earlier when a man with the same profession had come to his aid.

‘I told the story about how I was fishing and I got a triple hook embedded deep into my hand,’ Mr Gronowski said.

‘I was in a lot of pain and my son 
asked if anyone was a doctor and this guy paddles up in a kayak.

'He was a
nurse practitioner and he surgically removed the hook from my hand. 
Chris looked at me and said, “That was me.”’

Mr
Manacci calls it a blessing ‘You just never know what the day brings 
you and you never know, you never know what small thing you will do that
will result in a miracle,’ he said.

The driver of the truck was taken to a nearby hospital and later charged with Operating Vehicle while Impaired.
