Challenge: Mr Conville honed his skills in Scotland, where he was an adventure activities instructor

He was the climber whose love of Scotland’s mountains inspired his attempt on the feared Matterhorn - an Alpine adventure that ended in  tragedy and left his body locked in a tomb of ice.

When Jonathan Conville plunged from the 14,690ft peak in 1979, the odds against finding his body were as high as the vertical challenges he lived for.

But, 34 years on, melting glacial ice - a result of global warming - has revealed his remains, which have finally been reunited with his family.

The 27-year-old ex-paratrooper was an instructor at an outward bound centre at Loch Eil, near Fort William, Inverness-shire, when he set out to conquer the Matterhorn – only to join the 250 mountaineers whose bodies have never been recovered from its perilous north face.

Now his family - who founded a  charity in his honour - are preparing to scatter the ashes of the English former public schoolboy.

Mr Conville had overcome troubled times to find peace in the Highlands. Honing his craft on the demanding peaks, he became a highly respected mountaineer.

A few days after spending Christmas with his family, the Marlborough College ex-pupil set off for Switzerland with a Dutch friend.

The path to his final adventure had been long and often troubled.

He was not regarded as a model pupil at his school and left under a cloud, developing a drug problem in his teens.

But after leaving school he travelled to Nepal, where he turned his life around.

Once back in Britain, he joined the Parachute Regiment, developing a passion for the outdoors and learning to ski and climb.

He left the Army in the 1970s and studied to be an outdoor instructor, eventually working for the Outward Bound Trust at Loch Eil.

Scotland provided his ‘role in life’. Mr Conville’s sister, Katrina Taee, recalled yesterday: ‘He loved the Scottish mountains and the charity we founded in his honour to help young climbers continues to have very strong ties to the Highlands.’

Adventurous: Mr Colville was foiled by bad weather as he descended the Swiss peak

It was in the Highlands that  he was reunited with childhood friend David Tidmarsh and together they took on harder and harder challenges.

Mr Tidmarsh said: ‘As climbing partners we challenged ourselves on the classic routes. His death was hard to deal with at the time.’

Mr Conville’s quest for challenges led him to attempt one of the world’s toughest ascents.

But bad weather closed in on him and his climbing partner as they descended the Matterhorn. Mr Conville disappeared and his friend had to be rescued by helicopter.

The legendary Matterhorn, pictured right in 1937, is one of the most celebrated mountains in the world, and legendary in the sport of mountaineering.

The Alpine colossus stands at 14,690ft on the Swiss-Italy border and with its four steep sides is one of the most photographed mountains in the world.

But its reputation comes from being one of the most dangerous peaks for climbers, with 500 having perished attempting to reach the summit.

In fact, so awe-inspiring is the Matterhorn that no climber visited its summit until 1865 – pretty late in Alpine terms.

Of the seven men who reached the summit 
in that first successful ascent of 1865, four met their maker on the way
 down, courtesy of a broken rope. The mountain still claims a 
regular supply of victims

Mont Blanc was first conquered in 1786, while the Grossglockner (Austria's highest peak) was crested as early as 1800.

His remains were finally located by Swiss rescue helicopter pilot Gerold Biner, who was flying near the peak’s north face last month when he spotted abandoned equipment.

Searchers then discovered bones and clothing bearing the dead climber’s name.

The remains were taken to a forensic laboratory involved in the investigation in 1991 of ‘Otzi’, the 5,000-year-old ice age ‘mummy’ also revealed by the ‘retreat’ of glacial ice.

The pathologists contacted the Jonathan Conville Memorial Trust website and Mrs Taee and her sister, Melissa, travelled to Switzerland to identify their brother’s  equipment and provide DNA samples.

Mrs Taee said: ‘It was poignant. There was a mummified hand, with nails and skin, and cupped, as if it was waiting to be held.

‘It was 34 years on and I was holding my brother’s hand. It was bittersweet but wonderful. It took ages for the DNA results to come through but they confirmed what we already knew.’

Mr Conville’s remains have since been cremated and the family are still deciding where to scatter his ashes. Mrs Taee added: ‘It will be somewhere in the mountains he loved.’
