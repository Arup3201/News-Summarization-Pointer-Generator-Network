Manuel Neuer is the ultimate 'sweeper-keeper' and now seems to want to spend more time outside his area than inside it.

Germany's No 1 could be found nearer the halfway line during Bayern Munich's 0-0 draw with Hamburg on Saturday.

As the match neared its conclusion, Neuer came to clear a loose ball but instead of hacking it away he took on not one but two opponents.

Unfortunately for Neuer, the incident happened outside the box, and he received a yellow card

He rounded the first, but came unstuck when a loose touch left him scrambling to reach the ball before the second opposition.

He didn't get there in time, and goalkeeping instincts came to the fore as Neuer got down low and stopped the ball with an outstretched arm.

Luckily for him and Bayern, he was only given a yellow card, and the match finished 0-0.

His reputation as a 'sweeper-keeper' was cemented during the World Cup after his display against Algeria.

He regularly found himself sprinting off his line to clear and was ultimately the difference as Germany won 2-1 on their way to lifting the trophy.
