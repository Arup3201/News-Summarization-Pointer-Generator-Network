Health chiefs have warned that an NHS black hole means patients may have to start paying for services - days after Norman Lamb (pictured) said the health service must spend its budget more wisely

A multi billion-pound black hole in NHS finances means that patients will have to get used to either being charged for treatment or paying increased taxes, health chiefs have warned.

In a stark analysis of the dangers facing the Health Service, the leaders of medical royal colleges and patients groups said it was ‘creaking at the seams’ and cannot carry on as it is.

The funding crisis is so dire that, in future, trusts may have to consider charging for GP appointments and asking patients to contribute towards the cost of drugs.

The warning comes just days after a health minister admitted that by the end of the decade, the NHS will face a funding gap of £30billion a year – with ‘dire’ consequences for patients.

The Mail revealed on Saturday that Norman Lamb had told an audience of Liberal Democrats last month that ‘absolutely vital services’ will have to be cut if the Health Service does not spend its £100billion-a-year budget more efficiently.

Shortages are already beginning to affect the NHS, with some patients being denied cancer drugs and longer waiting lists for A&E and cancer treatment. The Health Service also needs 3,000 more midwives.

Yet despite this, the NHS has found tens of millions to spend on cosmetic surgery such as facelifts, nose jobs, liposuction and breast augmentation.

Every week there are now 164 taxpayer-funded nose jobs, 37 liposuction procedures, 22 facelifts and 273 breast enlargements being carried out on the cash-strapped Health Service.

In a letter to the Times, health experts concurred with Mr Lamb on the scale of the black hole.

Senior figures including Sir Richard Thompson, president of the Royal College of Physicians, and Dr Maureen Baker, chairwoman of the Royal College of General Practitioners, warned that by 2020 the NHS will require an additional £30billion to maintain the current level of service provision.

‘The status quo is not an option,’ they wrote. ‘We are already seeing the signs of the system creaking at the seams.

‘All financial options are difficult politically; higher tax spend, co-payments or changes to what is available.’

Patients have been warned that they face paying for drugs or GPs' appointments if the funding gap cannot be closed

The nine signatories called for more to be done to improve the efficiency of the NHS and address the ‘budget crisis’ affecting it as people enjoy longer life expectancies.

‘More must be done by us all to eliminate inefficiencies and wasteful variation in care, and apply technology to transform care delivery,’ the letter said.

‘Resources and vigorous service reform must go hand-in-hand. Business as usual won’t do.’

They call for an ‘honest, open dialogue’ on the issue, adding that unpopular moves – such as hospital closures – may need to be considered.

‘We need a new settlement; a fundamental, holistic agreement with the country on what health and social care should be, how and where it is delivered to maximise the quality of care, and how it should be paid for,’ the letter said.

‘We believe the route is an all-party-mandated, independently conducted “national conversation” on the scope, provision and funding of health and social care.’

The letter was also signed by Sir John Oldham of the Independent Commission on Whole Person Care, Jeremy Hughes of the Alzheimer’s Society, Dr Jean-Pierre Van Besouw of the Royal College of Anaesthetists, Chris Hopson of the Foundation Trust Network, Ciaran Devane of Macmillan Cancer Support, Lord Adebowale of Turning Point.

Mr Devane and Lord Adebowale are both non-executive directors of NHS England, which is responsible for most of the health budget.

Sir John said: ‘It would require productivity gains greater than what was achieved during the Industrial Revolution to bridge the gap, and the NHS has never been close to that.’

A Department of Health spokeswoman said: ‘The NHS will remain free at the point of use.

‘We are already dealing with the challenge of a growing, ageing population by moving to a system geared towards prevention rather than just treatment by improving community care to keep people living healthier at home for longer.’
