The
 owners of a 22-pound housecat that trapped them in their bedroom after 
attacking their baby insist they are not giving up on their pet and are 
instead getting it therapy.

Two
 days after police arrived to subdue the four-year-old part-Himalayan 
cat, owner Lee Palmer of Portland said he is taking the feline to a 
veterinarian.

A pet psychologist also is due at the house to see the cat, named Lux.

The owners of Lux, a 22-pound housecat that trapped them in their bedroom after attacking their baby insist they are not giving up on their pet and are instead getting it therapy

'We're not getting rid of him right now,' Palmer said. 'He's been part of our family for a long time.'

Palmer says the animal attacked his seven-month-old child after the baby pulled its tail.

The child suffered a few scratches on the forehead.

On the 911 call, Palmer tells the dispatcher he kicked the cat 'in the rear' to protect his child.

Like butter wouldn't melt: Lux is a Himalayan with a 'history of violence,' say his owners. They were forced to call 911 on Sunday after Lux attacked their baby and then cornered them in a bedroom

Attack: Teresa Barker, pictured with her baby Jesse, who was starched on the forehead by Lux

Escape: Jesse didn't need medical attention but his parents were concerned Lux would attack again

Palmer says the animal then 'just went off over the edge' - leading Palmer and his girlfriend to barricade themselves, their baby and the family dog in the bedroom for safety.

The cat can be heard screeching in the background of the call as Palmer says in a panicked voice:

'He's charging us. He's at our bedroom door.' Palmer also tells the dispatcher the cat has been violent in the past.

Officers used a dog snare to capture the animal, and placed it in a crate.

The cat attack story gained national attention after police put out a news release about it Monday.

Palmer says the family has had proposals from people wanting to adopt Lux, but the family is not taking them up on it.

Emergency: Lee Palmer and his girlfriend were too fearful of their cat Lux to emerge from their bedroom

Quiet moment: Teresa Barker posted this picture of herself and Lux on Facebook in happier times
