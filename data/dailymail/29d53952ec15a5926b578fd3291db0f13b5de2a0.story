The upstate New York home of former 
NFL player Brian Holloway that was trashed during a party attended by 
hundreds of young people has been sold at a foreclosure auction.

Holloway said that his 200-acre property in rural Stephentown sold for $400,000 during Tuesday morning's auction.

The
only bidder was Berkshire Bank, which bought the lien on the house. 
Local media has reported that Holloway owed more than $1 million to the 
bank.

Brian Holloway watched as his home was auctioned off to a bank for $400,000 on Tuesday after it had been trashed during a massive teenage party

Holloway had been seeking to sell the property for $1 million. He says he's working on plans to reacquire the property.

Thousands
of dollars in damage was done during a Labor Day weekend party attended
by up to 400 people who broke into the house. Police have charged eight
people.

The alleged ringleader was arraigned on September 27 on felony charges of burglary and criminal mischief.

Seth Hawk, 19, is also facing misdemeanor charges for serving alcohol to minors, endangering the welfare of a child and unlawfully dealing with a child.

He was arraigned before Stephentown Judge Cyril Grant along with five others who have been arrested on charges related to the party, which left up to $40,000 in damages to Holloway's home.

Damages: Here Holloway power washes off graffiti that covered a barn on his property. He estimates the damages will cost at least $20,000 to fix, but likely up to $40,000

Sgt. Shane J. Holcomb, who is leading the investigation, said not all the partiers were sorry for the damage.

'Some are remorseful; some aren’t,' Holcomb told the Register-Star.

Police expect to charge hundreds of attendees, more than 300 of whom they have already identified through social media posts that the teens were sharing online from the August 31 incident.

All the attendees will face charges and will be 'photographed and fingerprinted,' Holcomb said. Those who come forward on their own will be treated more favorably, he added.

In the course of their investigation, 
police discovered plans for another - even bigger - party in the area 
planned for September 20. At least 4,000 people were expected to attend 
the party, which police thwarted after learning of it.

Holloway
said that he had taken Hawk into his home four years ago when he was homeless.

He said hearing about Hawk's involvement 'was a shocker.'

'We're still pulling for him,' he said. 'This may be the thing to get him on track.'

Holloway, 
who played offensive tackle for the Patriots and Raiders in the 1980s, 
gained national attention by reposting party pictures the teens had put 
on social media websites.

He said he posted them on the website 
helpmesave300.com in an effort to get the teens to come forward, take 
responsibility for their actions and change their behavior.

Educational? Hollow invited the teens to his home and posted their names online in order to try to educate them about the dangers of drugs, alcohol, and lawbreaking

Evidence: Many of the estimated 300 teens documented the illegal party by Instagramming and tweeting pictures and messages about the event. Holloway has, in turn, posted the messages on a website he calls HelpMeSave300

'They all committed a crime,' Holloway said. 'There are going to be repercussions that will be significant for some and infinitely significant for others.'

Smashed: Windows appeared to be a favorite target of the rambunctious teens, as they were smashed throughout the property

Word quickly spread: Twitter helped turn the 
party into a drunken madhouse as word of it spread from Albany, New York
to Pittsfield, Massachusetts

Just one? A wrap-around porch was in shambles. Some angry parents say the illegal party was only one of many that have damaged the Holloway's second home

Dirty: Hollow arrived home to his floored covered in booze and eve urine. Some of the 300 partiers say they had no idea the party came after a break-in

Instead, he said, some parents were angry about his website and there was even a threatened lawsuit.

The
partiers caused at least up to $40,000 in damage to his rural vacation home 
near the Massachusetts border in Stephentown, including broken windows 
and holes in the wall, he said.

Among those who showed up to help Holloway clean were 16-year-old cousins Mikaela Byrnes and Ricky Nelson, of 
Waterford.

'I came 
back to clear my conscience, say "I'm sorry" to him in person, shake his
hand,' Nelson said.'I bought him an apology card, and gave that to him 
from me and Mikaela.'

Nelson
appears in many of the photos of the raucous event that were spread, 
mostly via Twitter, and then made their way onto Holloway's 
HelpMeSave300.com.
