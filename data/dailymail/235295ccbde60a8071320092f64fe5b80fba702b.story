Putting in a good, hard, sliding tackle is a great way to make your mark on a game, but Celtic star Stefan Johansen took it a bit too on Monday night.

Playing for Norway against Bulgaria in Oslo, the midfielder slid in on away manager Ljuboslav Penev in stoppage time, upending the Bulgarian coach in the dugout.

In truth, Johansen was merely trying to keep the ball in play and overstretched himself, but the incident sparked a touchline melee.

Penev was clearly unhappy with Johansen's impact, and pushed the Celtic man as he stood up, before two Bulgarian players also forcibly moved him away from their coach. 

As players from both teams sprinted across to get involved Johansen attempted to move back towards Penev, but was held back.

The pair did seem to make it up in the end however, shaking hands after each had been shown a yellow card by Portuguese referee Olegario Benquerenca.

Norway saw out the remaining few seconds to win 2-1, and move ahead of Bulgaria in Group H.
