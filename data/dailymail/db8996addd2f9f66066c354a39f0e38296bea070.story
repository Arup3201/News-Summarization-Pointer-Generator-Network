A 57-year-old man endured a terrifying ordeal on his way to work as a hooded stranger jumped in his car and forced him to drive more than an hour up to the Central Coast, north of Sydney.

Phil Waltis’ day began like any other on Thursday morning – he got changed into his work clothes, drove to the petrol station to fill up his car then started to make his way to work.

But it took an extremely unexpected turn for the worse when a man in a dark hooded top and dark pants jumped in the front passenger seat of Waltis’ car at a set of traffic lights in Campbelltown in southwest Sydney.

‘Someone jumped in the car and then he just said “drive”,’ Mr Waltis told Channel Nine News. ‘That’s what happened, and I feared for my life.’

Mr Waltis said he feared for his life as the carjacker sat in silence for the 140km hour trip

The Leumah resident then spent more than an hour driving with the carjacker sitting next to him in complete silence for the entire horrifying car trip.

A visibly shaken Mr Waltis said the only way he managed to get through the traumatic experience was to concentrate on the road.

‘I just focused on driving. I didn’t want to have eye contact with him, I just focused on driving,’ he said. ‘I didn’t know if he had a weapon or not. It’s still a blur, I’m still having flashbacks.’

It wasn’t until Mr Waltis told the carjacker that he needed to pull in to use the bathroom at the service station on the M1 freeway at Jilliby, about 140km away, that the kidnapper jumped out of the car as it slowed down.

The shocked and distressed man went to Julie Gergely, who was nearby, for help.‘I actually thought he was having a heart attack because he was holding his chest and severely shaking,’ Ms Gergely told the Seven Network.

‘I couldn't quite work it out and then I heard him say he has been kidnapped. Then he said hijacked and he said, ‘Please call the police’.’

Mr Waltis described the man as in his 20s, dressed in dark clothing and a hooded jumper, and about five foot, seven inches tall.

Investigators said while the victim was ‘distraught’, it was an ‘unusual’ complaint.

‘It is an unusual allegation, but as in anything, we've got to investigate fully to see where the matter lies,’ a police spokesman said.

‘The victim alleges he went looking for the offender for a period of time. He drove around for a while, then stopped at one of the fast food stores, where he broke down, distraught.’

Mr Waltis (pictured being comforted by his wife) said: ''I didn't know if he had a weapon or not. It's still a blur, I'm still having flashbacks'
