Nearly four million immigrants swelled the population of England and Wales over just ten years, the results of the national census revealed yesterday.

The grand survey of Britain, which took place in 2011, uncovers details of a decade of sweeping social change.

The figures show 7.5million people who were born abroad were living here last year – of whom more than half have arrived since 2001.

The results from the national headcount provide the clearest picture yet of the impact of immigration on the country over the past few years.

Census officials said they mean that more than 70 per cent of the record rise in the overall population over the past decade is produced by people who migrated into Britain.

Migration was a key factor in a decade of dramatic change in the make-up of the people of the country and in their beliefs, the census showed.

It found that as millions arrived from abroad, traditional pillars of society were crumbling.

The numbers professing to be Christians fell by four million and for the first time ever fewer than half the adult population were married.

Multicultural: The number of immigrants in England and Wales has shot up as the proportion of the population that is white has decreased over the past decade, according to census data

Nearly one in eight families were 
headed by a mixed race couple or had an ethnic mix of children and 
adults, and in parts of London fewer than one in five people described 
themselves as ‘white British’.

The overall findings showed that the 
share of the population who describe themselves as white has fallen to 
86 per cent, down from 91 per cent in the previous census in 2001.

Four out of five people in England and Wales, 80 per cent of the population, give their ethnicity as ‘white British’.

The findings published yesterday 
followed the initial census results which came out in the summer and 
showed that the population of England and Wales is now 56.1million.

Between 2001 and 2011, numbers went up by 3.7million, or 7 per cent.

The
 £500million census was carried out on March 27 last year and is meant 
to count everyone in the country.

It said 13 per cent of people in the 
country, 7.5million, were born outside Britain.

‘Those born outside the 
UK represent a stable definition of a migrant,’ the census report said.

Of these, 3.8million arrived after 
2001, including a high proportion who came from Poland and Eastern 
Europe after Tony Blair’s government allowed free immigration when their
 countries joined the EU in 2004.

The census report said: ‘This means 
that 71 per cent of the overall population growth in the last decade is 
accounted for by the non-UK resident population.’

Home Secretary Theresa May is to make a
 major speech today in which she is expected to claim that the 
Government is beginning to control immigration levels.

Most recent 
figures show the key indicator of net migration was down ‘significantly’
 over the most recent 12 months, from 242,000 to 183,000.

The Migration Watch UK think-tank said
 yesterday: ‘This is the clear result of Labour’s mass immigration 
policy which brought nearly four million immigrants to England and Wales
 in ten years.

‘Immigration on this scale is 
completely unacceptable to the vast majority of the public and is 
obviously unsustainable.

'Nothing could more clearly demonstrate the need
 to get immigration back under control so as to allow time for 
integration to occur.’

The nations where most migrants were 
born are India, Poland and Pakistan, according to the census results. 
Irish people, who made up the biggest population of those born abroad a 
decade ago, now rank fourth.

In London, more than half the people in the boroughs of Brent, Newham, Westminster and Kensington and Chelsea were born abroad.

Over London as a whole, fewer than half the population, 45 per cent, said they were white British.

However more than nine out of ten 
people, 91 per cent, describe themselves as at least one of English, 
Welsh, Scottish, Northern Irish or British.

England remains a nation of shopkeepers more than 200 years after the phrase was coined.

The most common job is working in the 
retail or wholesale trade, with nearly one in six of us employed in 
supplying and selling goods and services, from supermarket warehouses to
 motorcycle repair shops.

Health and social work is the second 
work category, occupying 12.5 per cent of those in work. Education comes
 next, followed by manufacturing, with 8.9 per cent of those in jobs.
