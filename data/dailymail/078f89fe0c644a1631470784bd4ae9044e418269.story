Tomas Wilmot was jailed for a total of nine years in August 2011

A former City stockbroker serving nine years for a £27.5m 'boiler room' scam apologised for his scruffy attire in court, blaming his wife for burning all his clothes.

Tomas Wilmot, 65, together with his sons Kevin, 44 and Christopher, 43, were jailed for a total of 19 years after cheating 1,700 vulnerable investors out of 'substantial' amounts of cash.

The trio tricked their victims into buying worthless, non-existent shares while operating mainly in Spain, as well as from offices in Brazil, Belize, Dubai and a number of Caribbean islands.

The scam was only discovered when searches carried out by officers examining a different boiler room fraud uncovered links to the Wilmots.

Tomas Wilmot was jailed for a total of nine years in August 2011, but he returned to Southwark Crown Court for a three day confiscation hearing this week.

The once hugely successful banker, who owned a string of homes and restaurants, revealed his turbulent relationship with his wife, Christine.

Modestly dressed in a green and navy striped polo shirt, jeans and white trainers, the pensioner could not disguise the bitterness in his voice when he said: 'May I apologise for how I am dressed, the wife, well ex-wife, burned all my clothes.

'All my memories, everything in the past, was burned,' he added. 'I'm not happy about this.

'But I believe there was no value in those items.  If the FSA think there is, they can go and talk to her.

'If they get any sense out of her, it will be a bloody miracle.'

Wilmot told how he had property repossessed and his family had struggled financially since his incarceration.

'From what I understand my wife and children are living with her mother because they have no money at all.

'If they had any other items they would have sold them.

'It's all very light hearted, the FSA and prosecution can put restraining orders on everything and somehow they will find hidden assets.

'We don't have hidden assets. My wife is working 70 to 80 hours a week.

'She and the children are living in cramped conditions with her mother. Her lifestyle is absolutely crap, it's appalling.'

Wilmot said his wife informed him other high value items worth about £50,000, including artwork, had been stolen around 2012.

'We have had difficulties in our marriage since 2004, extreme difficulties.

'It doesn't suit the prosecution to hear this but its true. She isn't the easiest to deal with.

'I did tell her to report it (the stolen items) but she doesn't take any notice of what I say - she is too busy burning my clothes.

'She couldn't afford to put them in storage so I assume what she is telling me is true.

'Her father's funeral expenses remain unpaid because she hasn't got the money for it.'

Wilmot said of the whereabouts of a 'beautifully designed' piece of jewellery he once gave his significant other: 'You know, I have absolutely no idea, you would have to ask her new boyfriend.'

Wilmot said he and his wife had yet to divorce, but added: 'That will happen in due course'.

He revealed: 'Whenever I gave my wife any money she would use it to try and divorce me.'

When questioned about his assets by prosecutor James Fletcher, Wilmot responded, without a hint of irony: 'I'm an honest man, I tell the truth.

'I find it really offensive to answer questions which suggest I'm lying.'

Jailing Wilmot, Judge Anthony Leonard described the total amount obtained by the fraud as 'staggering'.

'I judge you to be at the very centre of this fraud and to have been responsible for the involvement of your sons.'

Investigators unearthed tens of thousands of documents together with computer equipment during raids of the homes and offices of the three men in Guildford and Bramley, in Surrey, and Horsham, in West Sussex.

During a four year period £27.5m was paid into five UK bank accounts and £14m was transferred out to off-shore accounts in Spain, Malta and Lithuania.

Tomas Wilmot, of (Buckhurst), Westwood Lane, Normandy, Guildford, Surrey, was jailed for nine years after being convicted of four counts of conspiracy to defraud.

Christopher Wilmot and Kevin Wilmot of Horsham, West Sussex, were each jailed for five years after being convicted of the same charges.

A fourth man, Mark Dingley, of Bishop Stortford, Hertfordshire, who faced the same charges was cleared by the jury of any involvement in the scam.

A judgement has yet to be made on the total sum Wilmot raked in and any available assets which can potentially be clawed back.

The hearing continues.
