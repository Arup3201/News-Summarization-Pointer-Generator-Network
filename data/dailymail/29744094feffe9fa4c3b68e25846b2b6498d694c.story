Two fraternities that threatened to defy the University of Virginia's efforts to impose new regulations governing their parties say they will sign the agreement after all.

The university wanted stricter rules on alcohol and security at the parties following a Rolling Stone article that described a culture of campus sexual violence heavily intertwined with fraternity parties.

While much of the article has been discredited, U.Va. maintained the suspension of its fraternities and pushed ahead with the new rules.

Kappa Alpha and Alpha Tau Omega had said the agreement was unnecessary and their local chapters wouldn't sign it.

On Friday, the fraternities' national organizations said in a statement that the chapters would sign the agreement before Friday night's deadline because the university would otherwise not lift their suspension.

The article about the issue of sexual assault at UVA starts with the horrifying account of one student who claims to have been gang-raped by seven men in an apparent initiation ritual at the Phi Kappa Psi fraternity two years ago.

Anonymous: The UVA junior who accused the fraternity of gang rape, identified as Jackie, has had her story discredited in several reports

But after several holes in the victim's story were brought to light, and a police investigation found no evidence the crime ever happened, the Phi Kappa Psi fraternity was taken off suspension this week and are set to start their new remember recruitment - known as Rush - tonight.

Phi Psi president Stephen Scipione, a 21-year-old junior from Richmond, Virginia, spoke with the Washington Post and described the night in November when he and his brothers huddled around and read the damning article.

'Some people actually had to leave the room while they were reading it because they were so upset,' Scipione said.

Details of the story were so distressing and cruel that it sparked mass protests on campus, with many calling for the end of all Greek Life. All fraternities and sororities were suspended for the rest of the semester while the university and local police investigated.

Just hours after the story came out, the Phi Psi house was gratified with statements like 'UVA Center for Rape Studies' and 'Suspend Us!' and the brothers say bricks were thrown through the windows.

Fearing their safety, most of them fled the house, booking hotel rooms.

Rumors of the Rolling Stone article started in September, when an executive from the nationals office was dispatched to the campus to question them about a story line the reporter chasing surrounding an incident at the fraternity in the fall of 2012.

Breaking their silence: Phi Kappa Psi President Stephen Scipione, left, and fraternity brother David Fontenot, right, spoke out this week to detail how their fraternity responded to the allegations in the now-discredited Rolling Stone article which named the house as the location of a gang rape in fall 2012

'He basically asked if, one, we knew about [the allegations] and, two, if we had committed it,' said Scipione. 'The look around the table was complete shock and awe.'

Reporter Sabrina Rubin Erdely sent Scipione an email with three questions before publishing the article, but would not say when the alleged gang rape happened or reveal any other details that would help him give her a detailed answer.

The reaction after reading the article when it was finally published, was shock and then confusion. Details of the article didn't add up to the brothers who were members of the fraternity when the alleged incident happened.

'We knew that the Rolling Stone story was not true,' said David Fontenot, 22, a senior from McLean, Virginia.

The brothers checked old emails, bank accounts and other fraternity records and discovered that they did not hold a party at the house the weekend of September 28, 2012 - and that no one in their fraternity matched the description of the primary attacker, a junior who worked at the university pool.

They also staunchly denied the suggestion that the incident was an initiation ritual for new members, as details of the attack suggested.

'We vehemently deny that it would be plausible as a ritualistic tradition to join our fraternity,' Scipione said.
