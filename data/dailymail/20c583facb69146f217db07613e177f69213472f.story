Oldham Athletic are pressing ahead with their plans to sign convicted rapist Ched Evans.

The League One club are ready to ignore calls from major political figures and senior police officers - not to mention more than 30,000 people who have signed a petition – and recruit a 26-year-old who only recently was released from prison for raping a young woman in a hotel room.

At one stage on Tuesday a joint statement was being prepared by the Professional Footballers’ Association in tandem with Evans, and according to sources might even have contained some words of contrition from the disgraced Welsh international striker.

That said, Evans will not want to jeopardise his appeal with the Criminal Cases Review Commission and PFA sources insisted a statement would not be issued on Tuesday after all.

Oldham are still in talks with their own sponsors, and only if they can gain the support of their key financial backers will they recruit the former Sheffield United striker whose path back to Bramall Lane – and Hartlepool – has already been blocked.

Newcastle owner Mike Ashley held the key to the future of Evans on Monday night.

Oldham stalled on the former Sheffield United striker on Monday, stating that they would ‘continue to have conversations with representative bodies such as the PFA’ before making a decision.

But two club sponsors have threatened to withdraw their backing if Oldham sign Evans – who was due to report for training on Monday but in the end did not show – and Ashley came under pressure to withdraw Sports Direct’s sponsorship as well.

That particular deal is worth around £1million over five years to Oldham and club chairman and owner Simon Corney – currently in New York – would almost certainly be forced to abort his pursuit of Evans if Ashley felt it impossible to ignore a personal request from Northumbria Police and Crime Commissioner Vera Baird.

In a personal letter to Ashley she wrote: ‘If Oldham Athletic decide to appoint him, I would urge you to withdraw Sports Direct sponsorship at the club. It is tantamount to saying that sexual abuse is okay as long as you can play football.

‘My office works closely with Newcastle United Foundation and has funded a number of initiatives working with young people to help them understand what is right and wrong.’

On Tuesday, pressure on Oldham even came from prime minister David Cameron, whose official Westminster spokesman outlined his position on an issue that has divided football.

'His view hasn't changed (from) ... the time when there were reports around Sheffield United,’ said the spokesman.

'Ultimately, it is for employers to take decisions, but the Prime Minister does think that footballers are role models and he is sure that any potential would-be clubs and employers will weigh their decisions very carefully.'

On Monday shadow sports minister Clive Efford called on the Football Association to withdraw Evans’ registration should Oldham try to recruit him.
