A skydiver has spoken of  the terrifying moment he was knocked unconscious seconds after jumping out of a plane at 12,500ft.

Experienced skydiver James Lee, 25, was hit from behind by another skydiver and knocked out.

He was left hurtling towards British countryside just after jumping out of the plane at the Skydive ground in Netheravon, Wiltshire.

Speaking on Good Morning America he told how he was saved from certain death by two other skydivers who, having seen what had happened, managed to grab hold of him and deploy his own parachute

Pictures taken on Mr Lee's head-camera also show the other skydivers made signs to check he was okay before realizing that something had gone terribly wrong, and taking action that ultimately saved his life.

Saved: James Lee, 25, from Gloucestershire, was making his 1,050th jump at Netheravon, Wiltshire, when the terrifying accident happened. He was knocked unconscious by another skydiver

'I've been skydiving for five years and 
this was my 1,050th jump.  There were 12 people in this skydive, with 
others leaving the plane just after we jump off,' he said.

'One of the skydivers who left the plane through the door came out unstable and went into a spin.

'They were falling faster than I was and their shin impacted the back of my helmet with a lot of force, knocking me out and leaving me unconscious. From then, I've no real recollection of what happened,' Mr Lee said.

It's hard to imagine a more heart stopping moment having jumped more than 1,000 times, he was left helpless after he blacked out, plummeting towards the earth at 120 mph.

He went on: 'I am now tumbling through the air uncontrollably and two other skydivers realized something was wrong.'

What happened next was incredible.

Out of control: Thousands of feet above the ground, Mr Lee's arms flail around as he plummets down

You OK? This picture, taken on Mr Lee's head-camera, shows another skydiver asking the unconscious man if he is alright.

Mr Lee regained consciousness as he floated down, with no memory of the accident

'Two
 of my friends came down to see if I was responding.' Mr Lee was out 
cold and his hands were limp. His friends stabilized him and opened his 
parachute.

'They chased after me and fortunately I roll into a more stable position - still quickly drifting in the sky.

'At first the other skydivers give 
basic hand signals that we teach our students to correct their body 
position and find I am still not responding.

'They
 manage to get hold of me to try and stop my body tumbling again as we 
get closer to the altitude where, as a group we separate to deploy our 
parachutes.

'They
 signal to the other jumpers to get away as they were unaware of what 
was happening. They then deploy my main parachute. Once I was clear they
 deployed their own.'

Mr Lee only regained consciousness as he
 drifted safely down to the ground, where he landed safely and with no 
memory at all of what had just happened.

When he finally reached the ground, the relief he felt is clear for all to hear as he let out an enormous sigh.

'I was just happy to be on the ground because everything moves a bit slower then.'

He was taken to hospital where he was treated for an injury to his head, and then given the all-clear and discharged.

'This
 is not something you are taught to do or practice for as it is very 
uncommon. I think my mum and girlfriend are more relieved than I am.' 

Mr Lee added: 'I am very glad that everything unfolded how it did.

He says that the accident has not deterred him one bit from skydiving because he loves the sport so much.

Help arrives: This head-cam shot shows one of Mr Lee's friends grab his arm to steady him before pulling the cord

With his body now stabilised in the air, another skydiver on Mr Lee's right goes to pull the parachute cord

Mr Lee, shown here on another jump, is an experienced skydiver who has completed more than 1,000 jumps
