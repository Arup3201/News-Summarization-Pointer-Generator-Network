The Boston police commissioner has 
confirmed that the younger bombing suspect killed his own brother by 
running him over with an SUV while officers were trying to arrest him.

Ed Davis told CNN he believes Tamerlan Tsarnaev died from being hit and dragged 40 feet by his own brother Dzhokhar.

Doctors revealed that Tamerlan had 
been shot and appeared to have suffered a bomb blast, however his wounds
 from the tires of his stolen SUV appeared the most severe.

A medical examiner must still confirm the cause of death.

Law enforcement sources told MailOnline Tamerlan and Dzhokhar Tsarnaev were determined not to be taken alive.

Authorities are investigating whether Dzhokar, 19, ran over his brother as part of a 
suicide pact so that neither of them could be put on trial.

Later, as police closed in, Dzhokar reportedly put a gun in his mouth and pulled the trigger.

'These guys did not have an exit plan
 after the bombing, and from they way they have both ended up it looks 
like they planned on never being taken alive,' said a law enforcement 
source.

'Why else would this kid drive over 
his brother? It does not make any sense until you realise he also tried 
to take his own life. They had some sort of suicide pact worked out so 
they would not be taken alive.'

Offering the first detailed account 
of the firefight, Police Chief Edward Deveau, of Watertown, 
Massachusetts, where the drama had unfolded early Friday morning, has 
revealed that 26-year-old Tamerlan Tsarnaev walked towards officers 
firing a gun before he ran out of ammunition and was tackled to the 
ground.

'He all of a 
sudden comes out from under cover and just starts walking down the 
street, shooting at our police officers, trying to get closer,' Deveau 
said.

Nothing to lose: At one point, police say Tamerlan marched down the street toward police while firing a gun at them

'Now, my closest officer is five to 10 
feet away, and they're exchanging gunfire between them. And he runs out 
of ammunition -- the bad guy -- and so one of my police officers comes 
off the side and tackles him in the street.'

He was in the process of being 
handcuffed by two or three officers when his younger brother, 
19-year-old Dzhokhar, jumped behind the wheel of a black SUV the two 
hand allegedly carjacked earlier and barreled toward the group.

Officers
 who were restraining Tamerlan Tsarnaev got out of the way of the 
speeding vehicle, which ended up driving over the wounded suspect, the 
police chief told CNN.

According
 to Deveau, the 19-year-old suspect dragged his sibling’s body a short 
distance down the street and drove off. He later ditched the SUV and 
escaped on foot.

Tamerlan Tsarnaev was pronounced dead at a hospital a short time later.

An
 alleged autopsy photograph of Tamerlan that was leaked Friday shows 
multiple gunshot wounds and a massive open gash that spans from the 
center of his chest to his back.

Another smaller gash is located right below the larger wound. His right shoulder and his face show signs of hemorrhaging.

Some of the injuries could have been sustained during doctors' attempts to revive him. MailOnline is not publishing the photo due to its graphic nature.

The results of the autopsy have not been released yet, but the preliminary description of the injuries suggests that some of the wounds may have been caused by the vehicle operated by the suspect's brother.  

Dzhokhar Tsarnaev was captured Friday evening following a tense standoff after he was spotted hiding in a boat parked in a backyard, bleeding profusely.

Violence erupted in the early morning hours Friday when police received reports of a robbery of a convenience store in Kendall Square near MIT and a police officer was shot and ended up with a gun fight in a small suburban street as residents slept.

Sean Collier, an MIT police officer, was shot multiple times while in his cruiser at Main and Vassar streets, near the Stata Center on the MIT campus.

The 26-year-old officer was pronounced dead at Massachusetts General Hospital.

A short time later, the two men carjacked a Mercedes SUV at gunpoint.

The hostage was then driven around for half an hour as the pair decided what their next move would be.

As police moved in on the vehicle following reports of a carjacking, the pair decided to dump the driver at a gas station on Memorial Drive in Cambridge.

The search for the vehicle led to a chase that ended in Watertown, where authorities said the suspects threw explosive devices from the car and exchanged gunfire with police.

Richard H. Donahue, 33,  a transit police officer was seriously injured during the chase.

In Watertown, witnesses reported hearing multiple gunshots and explosions at about 1am Friday.

Dozens of police officers and FBI agents were in the neighborhood and a helicopter circled overhead.

Speaking to CNN following Dzhokhar's capture, Deveau said that a single officer was the first to encounter the two cars that Tamerlan and Dzhokhar Tsarnaev were driving, just before 1am Friday.

One of the vehicles was a Mercedes SUV the brothers had carjacked earlier that night.Before the officer could call for backup, the two cars came to a stop and the brothers got out.

'They jump out of the car and unload on our police officer,' Deveau said 'They both came out shooting -- shooting guns, handguns. He's under direct fire, very close by. He has to jam it in reverse and try to get himself a little distance.'

Five others officers arrived on the scene in the middle of an intense shootout during which Deveau says over 200 rounds were fired in 5-10 minutes.

The chief said that one of the suspected bombers lobbed an explosive at the officers, which later turned out to be a pressure cooker bomb like the ones used in the marathon attack Monday.

The brothers also allegedly threw 
other explosives at police, which Deveau described as 'very rough 
devices.' Two of the bombs detonated and two did not. A sixth explosive 
was later discovered in one of the vehicles.

At
 one point, the older brother came directly toward police, firing a gun 
at officers as he inched closer toward him, but Tamerlan Tsarnaev's luck
 ran out along with his ammunition, allowing one of the officers to 
tackle him.

Moments later, his younger brother ran him over while fleeing the scene in a black Mercedes.  Accord.

Dr. David Schoenfeld, of the Beth 
Israel Deaconess Medical Center, was the one who ended up treating the 
fatally injured Tamerlan Tsarnaev.

Hiding place: Dzhokhar Tsarnaev was eventually discovered wonded inside a boat parked in a backyard in Watertown, Mass.

'There was some discussion of who's coming in,' Schoenfeld said of the patient. 'Is it the suspect? Is this a victim? Is it a police officer?

'Ultimately that discussion died down quickly, because it doesn't matter who's coming in,' he added. 'We're going to treat them as best as we can, because you really don't know who it is until the dust settles.'

When the 26-year-old was brought in accompanied by a large police escort, he immediately went into cardiac arrest.

CPR was performed until a team of doctors could attempt to revive him, inserting chest tubes to treat potential injuries and gain vascular access to give the patient what Schoenfeld described as 'massive blood transfusions.'

Tsarnaev succumbed to his injuries at 1.35am. His body was turned over to law enforcement for examination to determine the source of his injuries.
