Army buddies: Sgt. Corey McCourt wanted his service dog Mina (pictured) buried in a national cemetery and his mother is now fighting to make it happen

A bomb-sniffing Army dog has been denied burial in a national cemetery, despite having served nine tours of duty in Afghanistan.

Mina, a Labrador retriever, was honorably discharged at age 11 with the rank of sergeant and then adopted by his brother in battle, Army Sgt. Corey McCourt.

Last week, Mina was euthanized at 13 after suffering a debilitating lung ailment. As McCourt continues his service duties, his mother June Etlinger got the job of finding a proper burial for Mina.

McCourt asked that Mina be buried in Great Lakes National Cemetery in Holly, Michigan.

But when the White Lake, Michigan military reached out to the national cemetery about burying Mina, she says she was snubbed.

'I don't think he's ever been asked that question before,' Etlinger told Fox 2 News. 'So he was kind of like "no, we don't do that here."'

According to Etlinger, the cemetery even threw her a little attitude. That, she said, doesn't sit well with her.

Mina served three tours of duty alongside McCourt. The two worked as a team, with Mina leading McCourt to bombs so he could disarm them.

Dangerous work that Etlinger says makes Mina deserving of a hero's burial.

'They were battle buddies,' Etlinger 
said. 'He brought my son home three times and six other people before 
him. My feeling is you need to honor him.'

Etlinger's
is a thoroughly military family. Her father and grandparents are all 
buried at Great Lakes National Cemetery and and she expects 
she expects both her service member sons to be buried there one day, 
too.

Not forgotten: Mina's service won her a sergeant's rank but doesn't earn her a burial in a national cemetery

Her dedication to the cause, then, is understandable.

Unfortunately, the animal hospital where Mina's remains currently reside will only keep them there for two weeks.

So,
the Michigan mom's one-woman grass roots campaign to get Mina interred 
at at the cemetery has also become a race against time.

With the clock ticking, Etlinger has 
started a Facebook page to spread word of her dilemma and try to move 
public support, and the support of Pentagon officials, in her favor.

The page quickly gained over 500,000 'likes.'

And on Thursday, Etlinger even reached out to U.S. Sen. Carl Levin for help.

Meanwhile, a statement from National Cemetery Administration maintains the Michigan cemetery's stance.

'The NCA understands how much service members love and respect their dog comrades,' the statement reads, 'They do honourable work and also serve our country. However, the National Cemetery Administration does not permit animals to be buried in any of our cemeteries.'

But Etlinger is undeterred.

With a confirmation from the Pentagon that national cemeteries will not bury animals, she is still prepared to take her fight all the way to Washington in spite of the odds.

'Now, they’ve made me mad,' she said. 'I’m not stopping. I’m not one to quit.'
