Sharp differences in the way different cities view foreigners have been revealed by a snapshot study into social attitudes in areas across the UK.

Belfast is revealed as one of the UK’s most tolerant major city, with three-quarters of people saying the presence of foreigners was good for their hometown.

But in London barely half of people think foreigners are well integrated into society.

The audit of city life across the EU reveals people in the UK think health, education and unemployment are the most important issues faced by the areas where they live.

The survey interviewed around 41,000 people in 79 cities across Europe. The UK cities featured were Belfast, Cardiff, Glasgow, London, Manchester, and Newcastle upon Tyne.

It showed dramatic differences in the way city dwellers view people from other countries.

In Belfast, 75 per cent of people said they thought the presence of foreigners was good for the city in Northern Ireland - higher than the EU average of 73 per cent.

By contrast, in London only 72 per cent of people agree, Glasgow 70 per cent, Cardiff 68 per cent, Manchester 67 per cent and Newcastle 63 per cent.

Just 26 per cent of people in the Greek capital of Athens thought foreigners were good for the city, compared to 91 per cent who said the same in the Romanian city of Cluj-Napoca. 

The Office for National Statistics said: ‘Levels of agreement with this statement were high in Europe with a typical 73 per cent agreement response.

‘The majority of respondents viewed the presence of foreigners as positive in all but five cities: Athens, Greece; Lefkosia, Cyprus; Liège, Belgium; Irakleio, Greece and Turin, Italy.

‘UK cities were mid to low ranking compared with Europe in believing foreigners to be good for their city. Greater Manchester was among the fifth of Europe cities where fewest people agreed with this statement.’

When asked to consider how well foreigners fit in to city life, just 58 per cent of people in London said migrants were 'well integrated'

 

When asked to consider how well foreigners fit in to city life, Glasgow came out on top, with two thirds (66 per cent) saying migrants were 'well integrated'.

All of the cities in the UK scored higher than the EU average of 54 per cent, with London and Greater Manchester the lowest on 58 per cent.

‘UK cities, with more than half of respondents believing foreigners to be well integrated, were high ranking in Europe; Cardiff and Glasgow were in the top fifth of European cities,’ the ONS added.

The study also showed that people in the UK were less worried about noise and air pollution than other parts of Europe.

Most were happy with public services, but satisfaction levels were lower in relation to the state of streets and buildings and levels of cleanliness.
