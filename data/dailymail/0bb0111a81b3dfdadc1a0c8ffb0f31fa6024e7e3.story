A group of nudists 
who got down to their bare essentials for a naked sports event on a beach earlier this year are now under investigation by authorities.

A video clip, which purportedly depicted a group of naturists engaging in 'nude sports games' on Penang island, appeared on video sharing site Vimeo.

But questions are now being asked as various Malaysian laws have been broken, and nudism goes against local sensitivities.Â 

Naked ambition: A group of Malaysian nudists involved in a naked sports event are now under investigation by authorities

The Penang Nude Sports Games 2014 
took place at Malaysia's Penang National Park on May 31.

The group competed in a number of events such as crab-walking, nude swimming and relay races - as well as taking photographs of each other and painting on each other's bodies.

But the police have now launched an 
inquiry into the naked sports event, and collected statements from 16 
witnesses.

One woman, a 35-year-old music teacher, was detained for questioning. Superintendent Lai Fah Hin said police believed the arrest could help shed light in their investigation.

He said police have also identified former teacher Chew Tok Hwa, 57, and Albert Yam, believed to be in his 40s, who were participants and organisers of the event.

'We hope all those participants can come forward and help us to facilitate the probe,' he said.

The video clip, titled Penang Nude Sports Games 2014, was uploaded to Vimeo about two months ago and showed participants dancing with each other, sitting around a fire and taking photos of each other in the nude.

The clip, which was uploaded by Albert Yam, was later removed.

Superintendent Lai said the police had received 11 reports on the incident.

State police chief Senior Deputy Commissioner Datuk Wira Abdul Rahim Hanafi said: 'We believe that the seven Malaysians identified in the video, including the organisers, are still at large because an Immigration Department check showed that they have not left the country.'

Park manager, Shah Headan, insisted that 'Malaysians would not accept nude activities here'.

Event
 participants, however, claim to have checked with park rangers before removing their clothes.

'After verifying with the ranger about our nude event, 
we moved to a hut nearby and start stripping', wrote Albert Yam in the 
description to the video clip, before adding: 'I am a friendly nudist. I love outdoor activities.'
