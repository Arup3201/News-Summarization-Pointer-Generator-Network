The mother of an unruly teen who was shipped to Siberia in 2011 has refused to bring the desperate 17-year-old back to America, claiming she didn't live up to her end of the bargain.

Natalie Roberts, 36, sent her daughter, Sofia Petrova, from Chantilly, Virginia, to live with her biological father in the frigid city of Novosibirsk after she failed at school, ran away from home and stole $1,000. But two-and-a-half years later, the stern mother insists the teen still hasn't learned her lesson, even though she claims her dad abused her.

'She had to meet two conditions to come back; finish school and show she's changed,' Roberts told People Magazine. 'She didn't.'

Hard: Natalie Roberts, 36, sent her daughter Sofia Petrova, pictured, from Chantilly, Virginia, to live with her father in the frigid Novosibirsk after she failed at school, ran away from home and stole $1,000

Sofia is growing increasingly desperate, as when she turns 18 she'll find it tougher to get back to America. This is because she's a Russian citizen, despite growing up her whole life in America.

'I can't understand it,' she told People. 'I just want to come home.'

Last month, Sofia launched an online campaign to get home, claiming she was beaten by her father, Igor, and was so miserable she tried to commit suicide.

This week, The Siberian Times reported the teen is planning to press criminal charges against Igor for alleged inappropriate behavior. In a recent visit to his flat, which was caught on video and broadcast around Russia, he is seen shoving her friend Nikita.

Sofia was a typical American teenager attending Chantilly High School when she was sent away. She was born in Siberia and her Siberian father still lives there - but she hadn't been there since she was two and did not speak any Russian.

Despite this, she was packed off almost 6,000 miles to meet her birth father Igor - who spoke no English - as an apparent punishment for her teenage transgressions.

Originally she was told she would stay three weeks, but once in Siberia, her mother - who is a US citizen -  told her that it would be much longer, and she is now well into her third year in Russia.

Plea: She has written yet another letter (pictured) to her mother, who lives in Virginia, but she said that she is not helping to speed up her return. She claims she has been beaten by her Siberian father

Since arriving there in March 2011, she 
revealed how she was forced to leave her father's home because he beat 
her and was often drunk.

In a children's center, with the 
possibility of being consigned to a grim orphanage, she tried to take 
her own life before going back to her father - because she thought if 
she did so her mother would allow her back to America.

Her
 appeals to the US embassy and Vladimir Putin's ombudsman for children, 
Pavel Astakhov, have all met with no response, she said. 

In October, she was tracked down by The Siberian Times to a Novosibirsk hostel where she lives and works a 60 hour week, including nights, to earn her keep and pay for her studies.

Now
 17, she penned a heartfelt letter to her mother in her latest desperate
 bid to be allowed back from Siberia where she says she has few friends 
and feels an outsider.

'Mom -
 With all that is going on I really hope that our relationship could 
improve rather than be completely destroyed to shreds,' she wrote. 'I 
love you so much and I miss you and Maria (her half-sister). I want to 
come home. To come back to you.

'I ask you one more time, please take me back. Please find it in your heart to forgive my mistakes that I made as a pre-teen. You are the only family that I have. I need you. With love, Sofia.'

Her step-father James Roberts is an 
immigration attorney who has said her behavior as a teen was 
'uncontrollable', including inviting boys home without permission.

'The
 behavior was becoming worse and we saw no solution. Worse, it was 
affecting the other children in the house, especially the outbursts that
 would last until 2am,' he told WUSA9 in an email.

Sofia is convinced he was behind her Siberian punishment, and that without him, her mother would not have sent her into exile.

Natalia
 added: 'Sending Sofia to her father, grandparents, uncle, aunt, and 
cousin was not an easy choice that we had to make, but it was the right 
choice.'

But Sofia she said she has hardly seen these other relatives. 

Sofia confessed her behavior was 
poor before she was sent away - she once stole more than $1000 in cash, 
but she denies she ever took drugs and believes she has more than paid 
the price for any adolescent excesses.

'I was 14 years old. I made many mistakes,' she admitted.

'The one big mistake I made, I did take money. It was not preplanned. I entered into the room and just saw it. I don't know why, I just took the money.

'And then my mother asked me, where I got this money from and I panicked and I told her that I sold drugs. It was biggest mistake of my life. 

Desperate: 'I can't understand it,' Sofia, pictured, told People this week. 'I just want to come home'

New home: Sofia, who spoke no Russian when she moved to Siberia, now lives in a hostel in Novosibirsk

Drama: This week, The Siberian Times reported the teen is planning to press criminal charges against Igor, pictured, for alleged inappropriate behavior

'I never did drugs, I never sold 
drugs. I told her later, that it was not true, that I stole the money. 
She told me - do you understand, you said that you sold drugs and it is 
too late now.

'I was already
 here, when I told her. Because after that day, I was on the plane two 
days later. It was one week after my 15th birthday.'

She
 was put into a Russian school in the Siberian outpost of Berdsk and 
only a friendly English language teacher helped her survive, she said.

Later she was helped to find a job in Novosibirsk, Siberia's largest city where she works 60 hours a week.

'I pay for my school. I study via the Internet. I study in American high school. I want to graduate in an American school. And I just hope it is not a scam,' she said.

More than anything, her dream is to be home - in America - for Christmas.

'I begged her millions of times. Take me home. I said, "I want my mom. I need my mom. I need my home. I don't have anything here,"' she said.

Her case has been publicized in the US thanks to the heroic action of her school friends like Michaela Bennett and Robert Buttaro who cannot bear the cruelty she is suffering.

Yet it is far from certain she will return to the US. If she turns 18 before being allowed back, and her birthday is next March, immigration rules will make it harder for her to return.
