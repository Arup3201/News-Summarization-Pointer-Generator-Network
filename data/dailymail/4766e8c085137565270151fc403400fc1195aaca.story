Downton Abbey's scheming under-butler Thomas Barrow isn’t anyone’s idea of a hero.

But in the new series of the hit ITV drama, the manservant played by Rob James-Collier risks his life to rescue a sleeping Lady Edith from a blaze that engulfs her bedroom.

Our exclusive pictures from the opening episode of the fifth series show the dramatic moment Thomas lifts the Earl of Grantham’s daughter into his arms and leads her to safety down a smoke-filled corridor.

Into the inferno: Under-butler Thomas Barrow saves Lady Edith in an unexpected act of heroism

The show’s 12 million fans know that Thomas has been blackmailing lady’s maid Baxter and his unexpected act of heroism allows him to dig himself out of a tricky situation.

The dramatic storyline – which has been glimpsed in trailers for the series – leads to the full-scale evacuation of Downton.

However, to avoid spoiling the series for viewers, we will not reveal the fate of any other characters.

Producers could not risk smoke damage to the corridor at Highclere Castle, where the series is filmed, so they built a replica at Ealing Studios.

The fictional fire has echoes in the history of Highclere, according to Lady Carnarvon, chatelaine of the Berkshire stately home.

Writing on her blog about what she calls ‘the great fire of Downton’, the Countess details the two blazes that hit Highclere in the past. The first ravaged the North Library 150 years ago, and she said viewers could spot the consequences of that blaze.

She wrote: ‘If you look closely at the gilded ceiling when you are watching the TV series you will see that it is far less ornate than the main library.’

The second fire broke out in rooms above the library in the 1930s. On that occasion three bedrooms were gutted but no one was hurt.

Flames of passion are also raging through Downton Abbey in the new series. 

Lady Mary Crawley’s love life is centre stage now that she has finally come to terms with the death of her husband Matthew, while the fallout from Anna’s rape and Lady Edith’s secret love child continues to cast a long shadow.

The new series is set against the election of Britain’s first Labour government in 1924.

The result proves unpopular with butler Carson, played by Jim Carter, and the Earl, played by Hugh Bonneville, who is convinced the new government is committed to the destruction of what he calls ‘people like us’.

When his daughter Mary asks if he is prejudiced because new Prime Minister Ramsay MacDonald is the son of a crofter, the Earl replies: ‘I don’t care if he is the son of Fu Manchu.’ 

The first episode, which airs at 9pm on Sunday, September 21, is set as the Granthams celebrate their 34th wedding anniversary.

They may not actually live at Downton Abbey but these three women will make their presence felt in series five.

Outspoken school teacher Sarah Bunting (Daisy Lewis, above left) secretly helps assistant cook Daisy to brush up on her maths and English. But Sarah’s Left-wing views cause conflict as the Earl of Grantham calls her the ‘Boudicca of the North Riding’.

Meanwhile, the Dowager Countess’s imperious friend Lady Shackleton (Dame Harriet Walter, centre) is embroiled in a love triangle with Isobel Crawley and Lord Merton.

But there’s far greater scandal as the amorous Lady Anstruther – played by Anna Chancellor, right – is an unwelcome house guest.
