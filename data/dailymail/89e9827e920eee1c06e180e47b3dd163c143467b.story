After nine years a group of Hollywood A-list stars joined Stephen Colbert on stage in New York, including James Franco, who is facing the displeasure of North Korean despot Kim Jong-Un, to sing a rendition of 'We'll Meet Again' in the final ever 'Colbert Report'. 

The Colbert Report, which started out as a segment on The Daily Show, featured Stephen Colbert playing a satirical news anchor Stephen Colbert and his take on the daily news. 

Colbert, who had President Barack Obama as one of his final interview guests, stepped down from his hit-rated Comedy Central show to take over from David Letterman on 'The Late Show'.

Stephen Colbert's character was loosely based on Bill O'Reilly on Fox News. Colbert played a very conservative commentator on US politics. 

Colbert, 50, ended his show's nine-year run on the cable channel Comedy Central without any guests, until the show's final moments when he broke into song and was joined by Jon Stewart, on whose show Colbert first introduced his persona of an egocentric, bombastic conservative pundit.

The singing comedians were soon joined by famous personalities from the worlds of entertainment, politics and sports including Randy Newman, Willie Nelson, Bryan Cranston, Tom Brokaw, Katie Couric, George Lucas and Sesame Street's Big Bird.

Among many others on hand were James Franco, Gloria Steinem, Sam Waterston, Jeff Daniels, Charlie Rose, Barry Manilow, Alan Alda, Kareem Abdul-Jabbar and New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio.

Before the starry sendoff, Colbert told any new viewers: 'If this is your first time tuning in to "The Colbert Report" I have some terrible news. This is in fact your last time tuning in to "The Colbert Report" - until 10 years from now when they reboot it directed by (the latest "Star Wars" director) J.J. Abrams.'

Colbert stuck to regular segments, including his satiric commentary, 'The Word' replete with references to his trademark 'truthiness' and other catch phrases, before accidentally killing off the recurring grim reaper character, Grimmy, exclaiming 'I just killed death. That means I am immortal.'

In a final bit, he was picked up from the roof by Santa's sleigh, joined by 'Jeopardy' host Alex Trebek.

'That was fun. OK, OK, that's the show,' he commented, concluding 'From eternity, I'm Stephen Colbert. John,' handing back to Stewart.

Colbert is set to take over CBS flagship late night talk show 'The Late Show' after current longtime host David Letterman leaves in May. CBS recently announced that the show will remain in New York.

The Colbert Report became influential by highlighting some of the major flaws in the US political system. 

He formed his own Super PAC, 'Americans for a Better Tomorrow, Tomorrow', which wanted public donations to show how such money distorts the political process. 

He even announced a presidential bid in 2007, but he would only run in his native South Carolina, where the Democratic Party voted to keep his name off the ballot. 

In 2010, he held an event with long-time mentor Jon Stewart on Washington's National Mall entitled a 'Rally to Restore Sanity and/or Fear'.
