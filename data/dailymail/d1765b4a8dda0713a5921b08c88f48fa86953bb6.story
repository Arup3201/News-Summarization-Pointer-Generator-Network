Josh Elliott has opened up about the ‘absurdist melodrama’ that has started since his sudden decision to leave Good Morning America was made public on Sunday.

‘It has been really difficult,’ he said.

‘It's been difficult to read categorical falsehood after categorical falsehood.’

He wouldn't comment on ABC News President Ben Sherwood's memo to ABC News employees announcing his departure this weekend, where Sherwood wrote that ‘we worked hard to close a significant gap between our generous offer and his expectations.’

Making the switch: Josh Elliott, pictured here in 2012, said that the root of his move to NBC was his love of sports but it is widely understood to be as a result of contract negotiations

Neither party has commented on the 
specific details of his contract negotiation, it has been widely 
reported that ABC offered him $5million to stay with Good Morning 
America but he wanted double that, asking for $10million.

A source told People that he will now be paid less than both of those figures, reportedly accepting a $4million deal with NBC.

‘In the end, it had nothing to do with money,’ he said.

‘It
 wasn't at all about anyone or anything at ABC... It was about what lies
 ahead for me at NBC Sports. I have always wanted to be part of an 
Olympics broadcast, and the opportunity to cover sports that captivate 
America was too good to pass up,’ Elliott told People.

‘There were two great offers on the table, and it certainly was a difficult choice to make. I feel I made the best one.’

He
 turned down the offer to remain at ABC's top-rated morning show to be 
what he described as ‘the last man on the bench with the showtime 
Lakers’.

Leaving 'the family': Elliott was part of the team that helped ABC beat Today in the ratings war, but now that he left his colleague Amy Robach (right) has been promoted to one of the main anchor positions

During a conference
 call on Wednesday arranged by his new employer, NBC, Elliott credited 
Sherwood with giving him the big break in his career.

Sherwood ‘is and always will be the reason I'm here,’ Elliott said.

‘I will forever love him deeply and passionately for it.’

ABC
 said there will likely be a taped tribute to Elliott on ‘Good Morning 
America,’ but it won't include a live appearance by him.

Elliott
 reiterated that his defection from ABC's ‘Good Morning America’ for NBC
 is a ‘deeply personal’ move to get back to his sports reporting roots.

NBC
 described his role during the Wednesday conference call, explaining 
that he will cover future Olympics, NFL football and other events.

His NBC debut is planned for the May 3 Kentucky Derby broadcast.

‘I have loved sports since before I could walk,’ said Elliott, 42.

Eying a spot: Michael Strahan (pictured today) confirmed that he is in negotiations to join the GMA team in addition to co-hosting 'Live with Kelly and Michael', which also airs on ABC

He said he dreamed of being on an Olympics broadcast before he even knew he wanted to be in television.

He
 worked at Sports Illustrated and then ESPN before 2011 when Sherwood 
played a hunch and hired him as news anchor at ‘Good Morning America.’

The
 arrival of Elliott and Lara Spencer built a feel-good team in the 
morning that prospered as ‘Today’ went through the excruciating exit of 
Ann Curry.

Now two members of that team — Elliott and weather forecaster Sam Champion — have left within four months of each other.

News
 has already broken about how Good Morning America is sorting out a deal
 with Michael Strahan, who already co-hosts the network's talk show 
'Live with Kelly and Michael', so that he can do that program while also
 working at GMA.

Strahan confirmed the negotiations on 'Live' this morning but said that the details had not yet been determined.

Elliott
 said he had not discussed any role at NBC News, where it was almost 
immediately speculated that he could be a potential successor to Matt 
Lauer in the morning.

‘I hope Matt Lauer is here when I step away from this gig 30 years down the road,’ he said.
