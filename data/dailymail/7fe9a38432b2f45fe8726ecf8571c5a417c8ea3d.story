A soldier who was struggling to raise her child claimed during a military court hearing in Fort Hood today that an army sergeant had enlisted her for a prostitution ring at the Texas base.

Sergeant 1st Class Gregory McQueen appeared in court over accusations that he recruited several cash-strapped female soldiers for an escort business.

If convicted, the former coordinator for the base's sexual assault and harassment program could face court-martial.

Hearing: Sergeant Gregory McQueen appeared before a Fort Hood military court on Tuesday over claims he set up a prostitution ring

The investigation into McQueen began in May last year, and he was charged in March with abusive sexual contact and other alleged misconduct.

At his hearing today, a female soldier testified that McQueen had recruited her for a series of sexual encounters with senior officers.

The witness claimed that McQueen first approached her for his 'escorting' business when she was 20, and struggling to pay off her student loans while raising a three-year-old child.

She said McQueen asked her to send him pictures of herself so he could find clients who would be willing to pay to have sex with her, KWTX reported.

The woman, who has not been named, alleged that McQueen visited her home on the Texas base and asked her to 'act out' on him what she would do with clients.

She claimed that she had sex with McQueen at her home last year, and that she had lied to the Army Criminal Investigation Division until she had been given immunity.

The soldier claimed that McQueen tried to get her to recruit other young servicewomen for the escort service.

McQueen is facing charges of pandering, conspiracy, maltreatment of a subordinate, abusive sexual contact, adultery and detrimental conduct. The hearing is expected to last two days.

A Fort Hood soldier has already been demoted and reprimanded in the case for conspiring to patronize a prostitute and solicitation to commit adultery.
