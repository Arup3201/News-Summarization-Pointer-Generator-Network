Thousands of mourners turned out Thursday to pay their respects to one of the two Las Vegas police officers killed by a pair of cowardly white supremacists who ambushed the two officers as they were eating pizza during their lunch break on Sunday.

Officer Igor Soldo, 31, was laid to rest at Canyon Ridge Christian Church in Las Vegas Thursday afternoon, while a service for Officer Alyn Beck, 41, is scheduled for Saturday.

In one of the more heartbreaking images from Thursday's service, Soldo's widow, Andrea Soldo, broke down in tears as her husband's casket sat just feet away while she clutched an American flag.

Hero: Thousands gathered at a Las Vegas church to mourn the loss of Officer Soldo

Relatives 
of good Samaritan Joseph Wilcox, 31 - who also was killed by the two 
gunmen - have not yet set a date for his memorial.

'This community has lost a true hero,' said friend Jason Hopfer, who worked with Soldo at the Metropolitan Police Department.

Soldo
 moved with his family from war-torn Bosnia when he was 13 and dreamed 
of becoming an officer, devouring books about the FBI and criminal 
interrogations, his father, Pero Soldo, told the Lincoln Journal Star.

He
 graduated from the University of Nebraska-Lincoln and worked as a 
correctional officer at a Lincoln jail until he got a job at the Las 
Vegas Police Department in 2006.

Soldo married a fellow correctional officer, Andrea, in 2009, and they had their son, Logan, last July.

'He was a wonderful child, a wonderful husband, a wonderful father,' his mother, Sirli Soldo, told the newspaper.

Soldo was the first to be gunned down midday Sunday by a married couple, including a man who espoused anti-government views and called law enforcement officers 'criminals' in YouTube videos.

Tragic: Officer Igor Soldo was died alongside Alyn Beck, who managed to fire several rounds at the two shooters even after he'd already been hit himself

Support: Andrea Soldo holds her son, Logan, as they arrive at Officer Igor Soldo's funeral

Soldo's neighbor in Nebraska, Kathy Kapustka, noted the tragic irony in the death of the 'brilliant, brilliant boy.'

'Survived a war and then to get killed here,' she said. 'Their family came here to be safe.'

After
 Soldo was shot at a Cici's Pizza about 5 miles from the Las Vegas 
Strip, Beck returned fire but was ultimately killed by the couple.

'He
 didn't cower. He went to get his gun. That was bravery to the end,' 
said Tracy Smith, a friend who met Beck through church. 'That was Alyn. 
He never turned from a fight. He never turned from a challenge.'

Support: A Las Vegas officer offers support his colleague as she breaks down during the funeral service for Soldo

Beck, who 
was from Wyoming, wrestled in high school, practiced mixed martial arts 
and had advanced weapons training. But he also had a soft side, Smith 
said â€” he loved to go out dancing with his wife and was thrilled when 
they recently had their third child.

A
 member of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, Beck served 
as a Sunday school teacher and as his church's emergency preparedness 
coordinator. He was also an avid woodworker who jumped at the chance to 
help others with home improvement projects.

'He didn't deserve to have this happen to him,' Smith said. 'He should have been left here to do good things.'

Minutes 
after shooters Jerad and Amanda Miller terrorized the pizza parlor, 
telling patrons there would be a revolution and draping a 'Don't tread 
on me' flag on Beck's body, they descended upon the Wal-Mart across the 
street.

Shopper
 Joseph Wilcox could have easily escaped through the front door when the
 couple walked in, fired a warning shot and told customers to get out.

But
 instead of fleeing, Wilcox, the proud new owner of a concealed weapon 
permit, lifted his shirt to grab his gun and slinked along a wall in a 
tactical position as he approached the shooter.

'He totally
 surprised me,' said Wilcox's best friend, Jeremy Tanner, who had 
accompanied him to the Wal-Mart. 'I expected him to leave with me.'

Wilcox 
didn't see Jerad Miller's gun-wielding wife as went in for the kill. 
Wilcox crossed in front of Amanda Miller, who fatally shot him in the 
ribs.

Tanner
 found himself standing outside the store alone for hours, anxiously 
awaiting a friend who would never come and never again answer his calls.
 It took more than 12 hours before authorities notified him that his 
best friend was the lone bystander dead inside.

A
 lifelong Las Vegas resident who aspired to police work and enjoyed 
four-wheeling with his friends, Wilcox was remembered as a generous man 
who jumped at the chance to help his ailing grandfather at all hours of 
the night.

'I'm
 not saying there aren't people out there that do that,' Joanne Wilson, 
Wilcox's aunt, told The Associated Press. 'But my nephew did that 
without batting an eye.'

The
 Millers, who had apparently been wounded by teams of responding 
officers, died in the back of the store. Amanda Miller's death was ruled
 a suicide, and her husband's, a homicide.

Loss: Joseph Wilcox, 31, had pulled out his weapon after hearing gunshots in Walmart on Sunday and started to move towards Jerad Miller to protect other shoppers - but was shot by Amanda Miller

The lives of Jerad Miller and Wilcox, who were both 31, overlapped in their enthusiasm for guns. Miller posted a YouTube video saying everyone should have a gun and calling all gun control laws illegal.

Wilcox was known for 'ranting about people who were anti-gun' on his Facebook page, Tanner said.

Wilcox, however, will be remembered as 'a selfless hero,' Tanner said. 'He put his life on the line for other people's lives.'
