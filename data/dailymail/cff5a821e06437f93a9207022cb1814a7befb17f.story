Sarah Wilson, who was abused by Asian attackers for five years from the age of 11, berated the man at the centre of the child sex scandal for refusing the leave his £85,000-a-year job.  

Miss Wilson's younger sister, Laura, died in the UK's first white honour killing carried out by an Asian boyfriend. She was 17 when she was stabbed and dumped in a canal by killer Ashtiaq Ashgar.

From the public gallery at a meeting in Rotherham today Sarah Wilson, who has waived her right to anonymity, yelled at the South Yorkshire Police and Crime Commissioner: 'You let my sister be murdered, you let us be groomed. You should be out or dead.’

Fury: Rotherham child abuse victim Sarah Wilson, who sister Laura was murdered by a member of an Asian paedophile ring, confronted South Yorkshire police chief Shaun Wright and demanded he resigns

Victim: Miss Wilson, who was abused from the age of 11 yelled: ''You let my sister be murdered, you let us be groomed. You should be out or dead.’

Before being elected South Yorkshire PCC in 2012, Mr Wright was Rotherham’s councillor in charge of children’s services for five years. 

The department repeatedly turned a blind eye to evidence that 1,400 girls had fallen into the clutches of paedophiles from 1997 to last year.  

Defence: Shaun Wright said that his record PCC 'speaks for itself' and would not resign

From 11 Sarah Wilson was plied with alcohol and cannabis by sexual predators who habitually abused her until she was 16, when they lost interest because she was no longer underage, she said. 

Having now turned her life around she waived her right to anonymity to  persuade other victims to come forward.  

Speaking to Shaun Wright directly Miss Wilson, who was joined by other victims: 'Alarm bells were ringing since I was 11-years-old and not at one time did I get offered any support from social services or the police.

'How can you sit there and deny everything you’ve done? How can you do it? What about all those families? You’ve done nothing to support us. Nothing'.

She added: 'I’ve had to live with this for 12 years and what have you done? You’ve still got your job.'

To Mr Wright directly, again, she said: 'You can’t even look me in the face, can you? Stand down'.

Responding to taunts he said: 'The young ladies in the public gallery, without a shadow of a doubt, have been let down and they deserve every course of support and every course of justice.'

He added: 'My record in tackling child sexual exploitation as PCC (Police and Crime Commissioner) speaks for itself.' 

At today's meeting Mr Wright was also confronted by the grandfather of one of the at least 1,400 children abused by gangs, mainly of Pakistani origin.

Speaking from the public gallery, the man said his 12-year-old granddaughter was arrested for being drunk and disorderly by police officers who let her four adult abusers go free.

The man said: 'You were a disgrace, mate. If I had a gun I would shoot you.'

Under pressure: Mr Wright has repeatedly harangued during a meeting today and left with help from police officers

Mr Wright responded, saying: 'Clearly, if that took place, it's an absolute disgrace.'

The PCC faced angry scenes at the meeting in Rotherham Town Hall as members of the public asked why he was still in his job.

Mr Wright has resisted widespread and repeated top-level calls for him to resign since the publication of the Jay Report into child sexual exploitation (CSE) in Rotherham, which detailed how at least 1,400 children were subjected to horrors including rape, violence and trafficking for sex between 1997 and 2013.

Before his election in 2012, he was a councillor in Rotherham for more than a decade and was the member of the council with responsibility for children's services from 2005 to 2010.

Calls for him to step down have been led by Prime Minister David Cameron, Home Secretary Theresa May, and Labour leader Ed Miliband.

But he has resisted every challenge and when Labour threatened to throw him out of the party, he resigned his membership. 

Today, chairman Harry Harpham said the panel had passed a vote of no confidence in the commissioner and endorsed calls made by the Home Affairs Select Committee for emergency legislation to change the law to enable PCCs to be sacked in 'exceptional circumstances'. 

One member of the panel, Ukip's Caven Vines, resigned on the spot saying he could not bear to be in the same room as Mr Wright any more. 

The chairman also revealed he had received two official complaints about Mr Wright which he had passed on to the Independent Police Complaints Commission (IPCC).

Before he left, Mr Wright told the panel that child sexual exploitation levels were just as high now as they were in the periods covered by the Jay Report.

The commissioner agreed this was on an 'industrial scale'.

He told the panel: 'It's a very difficult and complex issue to prevent. That shouldn't be any excuse for not trying to prevent it.

'But I'm afraid it is still going on today, it's just as prevalent today as it was in 2010 or 2005 or indeed any period before that.

'All I can say is that you've got my absolute commitment to continue the work that's already been put in place and to try and continue the progress that has been made since I've been police and crime commissioner.'

Laura Wilson, 17, was murdered by her Asian boyfriend in the UK's first white honour killing

Laura Wilson, from Rotherham, was 17 when she was stabbed and dumped in a canal by her Asian boyfriend in the UK's first white honour killing. 

Ashtiaq Ashgar, who Laura's family believe was using her for sex, murdered Laura in 2010 after she told his family about their secret relationship.

The teenager was left to die in a canal, after being stabbed more than 40 times, mostly to the head. 

After Laura's death, it was revealed that social workers had known for six years that the white teenage mother was at clear risk from predatory Asian gangs. 

They had received information about certain adults who were suspected of targeting Laura from the age of 11.

Laura began her relationship with Ashgar in 2008, when she was 15 and he was 16.

Ashgar came from a traditional Muslim family who were planning an arranged marriage for their son with a girl from Pakistan.

But unbeknown to his family, he lived a double life where he drank, smoked cannabis, carried weapons and had numerous relationship with women, including Laura.

When Laura found out that he has been seeing other girls, they broke up and she slept with this married friend, 22-year-old Ishaq 'Zac' Hussein, to make him jealous.

Just 16 at the time, Laura fell pregnant and had a daughter, Alicia. Hussein refused to acknowledge he was the father.

After Alicia was born, Laura and Ashgar rekindled their relationship. But he insisted it must be a secret.

Laura soon became sick of being Ashgar's secret and on October 6, 2010, she and her sister Sarah made the fatal mistake of revealing all to his family.

The teenager was left to die in a canal in Rotherham, after being stabbed more than 40 times

Laura and Sarah also visited Zac's family to reveal how he is the father of her baby.

After that, Ashgar sent Zac a text message saying: 'I'm gonna send that b***** to Hell.'

He also said he wanted to make 'beans on toast' of her, which is a phrase that means to spill blood.

Ashtiaq Ashgar, who was 18 at the time, is serving a life sentence for Laura's murder 

Ashgar then asked Laura to meet him at the canal one evening where he murdered her.

Both Ashgar and Hussein were charged with murder. Ashgar pleaded guilty and was given a life sentence. He will be eligible for parole in 2029 when he is 34.

Hussein was acquitted of murder following a retrial.

Laura's mother now looks after Laura’s daughter.

In 2012, the council’s Safeguarding Children Board published a serious case review about Laura's death.

But key passages which reveal they knew she was at particular risk from ‘Asian men’ had been blocked out with black lines.

The council went to court in an attempt to try to suppress the hidden information after a uncensored copy was leaked to the Times newspaper, but they abandoned legal action.

The uncensored report confirms that Laura, identified as Child S, had dealings with 15 agencies. 

The report identified ‘numerous missed opportunities’ to protect her and it states that she eventually became ‘almost invisible’ to care professionals.

The hidden information included the knowledge that, at the age of 13, Laura and a friend had been given alcohol by men at a takeaway who then asked what she would give them in return. 

She had also been referred to a child sexual exploitation project just three months after her 11th birthday.

Another censored passage reveals that Laura had been ‘mentioned’ during a 2009 police inquiry that eventually led to the conviction of five Pakistani men for sex offences against three underage girls.
