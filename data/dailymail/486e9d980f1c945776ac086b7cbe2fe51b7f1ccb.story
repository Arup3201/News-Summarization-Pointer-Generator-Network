'Murdered': Lauren Patterson, 24, is believed to have been found dead hours after flying back to the Middle East from her grandmother's funeral

Two men were yesterday arrested for the murder of a British teacher hours after she flew back to the Middle East from her grandmother’s funeral.

Lauren Patterson, 24, was last seen with two men at a nightclub in Qatar’s capital, Doha, on Saturday night but vanished afterwards.

Her body was later recovered and two men, said to be locals, were held.

News of Miss Patterson’s disappearance had prompted her family and friends to launch a frantic campaign on Facebook and other social media to find her.

But 40 hours later her boyfriend, James Grima, posted a message saying she was dead.

It was followed by dozens of tributes praising a ‘truly amazing’ young woman.

Yesterday Miss Patterson’s Kent-based mother, Alison, flew to Qatar to formally identify her body. In an online tribute, she wrote: ‘She was truly a remarkable girl, my rock, always there for everyone. I know she’s in heaven now in her Daddy’s arms.’

Miss Paterson had flown back to the Middle East on Friday and was a primary teacher at Newton British School in Doha.

On Sunday her boyfriend Mr Grima, an IT technician and DJ based in Malta, posted an appeal to track her down after becoming concerned about her disappearance.

The alert went viral as hundreds joined the search before it emerged Miss Patterson had been found dead.

Friends paid tribute on Facebook. Emma Nye said: ‘What an incredible best friend. Can’t handle the hurt in my heart.

'I love you so much. Will never forget all the hilarious memories we have. Be good up there!’

Yesterday, her mother Alison left her 
own online tribute, writing: ‘Thank you so much to everyone for all 
their wonderful words about Lauren.

‘She was a truly remarkable girl, my rock, always there for everyone. I know she’s in heaven now in her Daddy’s arms.’

Lauren Patterson, who flew back from 
her grandmother’s funeral on Friday, was a primary teacher at Newton 
British School in Doha.

Her mother, a widow, lives with Lauren's younger brother and sister in Kent.

Be good up there! Love you 333 333 333.'Another friend, Miranda Cecil, posted a picture on Facebook of Lauren in a Panda onesie, with the message: 'This was only a week ago and she put it on Instagram and tagged me in it. Oh my baby girl!!! X'

Lauren's younger sister uploaded a picture of them together and said 'thank you' to those sending messages of sympathy.

Friend Lorna Ann Campbell paid tribute, saying: 'I can't get my head around why someone so special has been taken from us. She meant the world to us and we will never forget how beautiful she was.'

Lauren Davey said: 'My dear friend has been taken from her family and friends Lauren Patterson I love u soooo much and will never ever forget u. U was taken from us to soon but u can now be with ur daddy. Xxx'

They had moved back to Britain only recently, after living in Luxembourg for seven years.

Her mother, a reflexologist, is believed to be flying out to Qatar. Neighbours were unaware of the apparent tragedy.

On
Sunday, Miss Patterson’s boyfriend Mr Grima, an IT technician and DJ 
based in Malta, posted an appeal to track her down after becoming 
concerned about her whereabouts.

The alert went viral as hundreds joined the search for her but hours later Mr Grima announced that she had died.

On Facebook he said: ‘I can’t believe that it had to end this way Lauren, I really don’t.

‘I was so happy that I had finally found someone that could change my life so much, and in such a positive way too...

‘Rest In Peace babe ... I will always look up at the sky cause you always were the brightest star and always will be.’

Mr
Grima added: 'I love you so much babe, I really do and I can’t get over
the fact that you were taken away so cruelly, it really breaks my heart
to think about it.

'I know you’re watching over us, wherever you are, 
and I know that I will meet you again one day.'

The Foreign Office said it was aware of reports that a body had been discovered but were unable to comment further.

A spokesman said: ‘We are aware of a British national, Lauren Patterson, reported missing in Qatar.

'You were the brightest star and always will be': Grieving boyfriend James Grima took to Facebook to confirm that Lauren had died

Sad time: Lauren had just returned to Doha from the UK last Friday where she had attended the funeral of her grandmother (pictured)

‘We are providing the family with consular assistance.’

Qatar, which will host the World Cup in 2022, is considered to be one of the safest spots in the Middle East for expatriates.

But
last November an American pre-school teacher, 40-year-old Jennifer 
Brown, was allegedly killed there by a Kenyan security guard.

He will face trial next month and could be given the death penalty if convicted.

Clues: Friends suggested that Miss Patterson had left the nightclub at five-star hotel La Cigale (pictured) with a group of Qatari men and had texted friends to say she was being taken to the wrong house
