A woman who was kidnapped from a motel parking lot and shoved into a black Acura by four women was covered in bite marks all over her body, and even on her face, when police found her.

The woman, who has not been named was kidnapped from a Motel 6 parking lot off Southside Commercial Parkway in Jonesboro, Georgia, on Sunday, according to police.

She is described as a 21-year-old white female who might have been taken at gun point. Police say they found a firearm in the getaway car.

Arrest: Police put one woman in handcuffs and have identified the suspects as Kyneisha Norman, 32, Shataya Durham, 17, Jasmine McCloud, Davel Locker, 17, and Teona Willis, 34

Taken: Eyewitnesses called 911 and gave a description of the vehicle to police 

The incident is being treated as a case of sex trafficking by authorities, who found the woman sobbing and terrified after a police chase four miles away from the motel.

A spokesperson from Jonesboro police said eyewitnesses saw five people shove the woman into a car in the parking lot of the Motel 6 and called 911, to give a description of the vehicle. 

Most of the suspects appeared to be women and were driving a black Acura car.

They have been identified as Kyneisha Norman, 32, Shataya Durham, 17, Jasmine McCloud, Davel Locker, 17, and Teona Willis, 34. 

Officer Cornell Madison from the Jonesboro Police Department said he spotted the car after police asked officers to look out for the vehicle.

He told WSB-TV: 'I saw the vehicle drive by and I did a u-turn, followed the vehicle and made a traffic stop.

'[I waited] until it was safe for myself and the victim as well.’

Kidnapped: The woman was taken from the parking lot of a motel 6 off Southside Commercial Parkway

‘When I walked up to the vehicle, the victim did have tears in her eyes and I asked her name and she didn't really want to tell me, but she seemed relieved to see me,’ he added. 

Officer Madison found the victim inside the car along with four women and one man. 

The suspects are each facing kidnapping charges and could face further charges for the weapon found in the car.

Officers suspect that the kidnapping was in relation to prostitution.

Officer Madison added: ‘Atlanta, from what i've been told, has the highest sex trafficking in the nation and our police chief makes sure we get training in how to search for that and look for that and fortunately, I was at the right place at the right time.’

The victim was taken to the hospital and is expected to be alright.
