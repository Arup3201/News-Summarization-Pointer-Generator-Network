Criticism: Councillor David Carr has come under fire for saying travellers should 'learn to live like everyone else'

A councillor in charge of allocating traveller sites is facing calls to resign after a rant against gypsies in which he said they 'screw everything up' and should 'learn to live like everyone else'.

Cllr David Carr, the Tory cabinet member for community safety on Medway Council in Kent, has been suspended from his new role for his comments, just days after being appointed.

Cllr Carr, a former Mayor of Medway, said he was 'against freeloaders' and that travellers 'c****ed all over the place' turning wherever they brought their caravans into a 'building site'.

In his first interview since being posted to the job - which puts him in charge of allocating new traveller sites - he told the Kent Messenger: 'They move on and turn it into a building site.

'They c*** all over the place, they p*** over the field, they throw rubbish all over the place.'

He added: 'Are they just people who sit in a caravan and plant themselves wherever they see fit without paying council tax and without cleaning up after themselves? Should one develop a nice strategy for that? No.

'They live on the fringe of that. They take everything they can get and give very little back so I take a pretty hard line.

'Why don't they learn to live like everybody else does? Why do they take everything, screw it up and move on? If they wanted to be part of society and take their place in society by paying their way, cleaning up after themselves and allowing themselves to be subject to community laws.'

Cllr Carr added that he would be in favour of allocating travellers an appropriate brownfield site, if he could be assured they would take 'a positive attitude'.

'But as far as I know successes in this area are very very few and far between,' he added.

He continued to say that travellers are unlikely to integrate into the community because they are continually moving from place to place.

Dispute: Travellers have occupied a site in Aylesford, Kent, for more than 25 years

The Tory also recalled how he had a tonne of 
coal stolen 26 years ago and followed the tyre tracks back to a 
traveller site, but no prosecution was brought.

Workers at the Gypsy Council have called on Cllr Carr to resign, saying he has 'no idea' about gypsy culture.

Chairman of the Gypsy Council Joseph 
Jones said this week: 'Cllr Carr should hang his head in political 
shame, using us for political gain. He has a responsibility to every 
member of society, not a select few.

'We feel that Cllr Carr has not one inkling of what the gypsy and traveller community culture is all about.

'For
over 500 years, we have had bigots like Cllr Carr making sweeping 
statements that could be taken in a right-wing racist way, inciting 
racial hatred toward the gypsy and traveller community.

'We are now seeking Cllr Carr stands down from his political career for his racist rant. We are seeking a prosecution.'

Cllr Rodney Chambers said Councillor Carr has been suspended from his council role in the wake of the comments pending a review.

In statement, the Conservative Group said: 'In light of the comments printed in the Medway Messenger, Cllr Carr has been suspended from his position as Portfolio Holder for Community Services and Customer Contact pending a review of the issues covered within the article.

'Cllr Carrâ€™s comments were not acceptable and he now appreciates that this is the case.

'We do not support the comments Cllr Carr said in the interview he gave shortly after being appointed to the portfolio.

'We at Medway Council are very proud of its record of working closely with all our communities across Medway and we are determined that the excellent relationships we have built up over the years will continue.'
