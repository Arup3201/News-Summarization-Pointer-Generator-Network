Former Newcastle United manager Glenn Roeder is a leading candidate to be the new sporting director at Crystal Palace.

Chairman Steve Parish has been looking to fill the position since August when Iain Moody left following allegations of misconduct during his time at Cardiff.

Roeder has been out of the game officially since 2009, but remains an influential figure and he recently recommended Russell Slade to be the next Cardiff boss.
