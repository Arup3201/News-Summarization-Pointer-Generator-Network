Zlatan Ibrahimovic was forced to apologise for a remarkable rant after Paris St Germain slumped to a third league defeat of the season.

The 33-year-old had branded the referee 's***' and said France doesn't deserve PSG, but had to back-track, claiming the comments were not directed towards the French people and that he hadn't meant them.

Ibrahimovic was caught on camera by infosport+ after a 3-2 defeat against Bordeaux that halted the defending champions' charge for the French title.

Ibrahimovic reacted angrily to the defeat and said it was the worst refereeing display he'd ever seen

'I wanted to say that my comments were directed neither towards France nor towards the French,' Ibrahimovic said after the game. 

'I was talking about football and nothing else. I lost the game, and I accept it but I do not agree when the referee does not follow the rules. This is not the first time that this happens. 

'I was speaking at the height of my anger and everyone knows that at times like these you can say things you don't mean. I apologise if people have felt offended.'

The Swedish striker, who scored twice in the 3-2 defeat, had reacted angrily to Diego Rolan's late goal, blasting the officials on his way to the dressing room.

'I played 15 years, I never seen a referee this s***,' he shouted. 'They don't even deserve PSG should be in this country.'

Following Ibrahimovic's remarks French sports minister Patrick Kanner had called on the Swede to apologise, saying 'disappointment did not justify his offensive comments', but later he later called the striker a 'great champion'.

Rolan scored from Brazilian defender Mariano's cross with a shot between the legs of goalkeeper Salvatore Sirigu. The strike ended PSG's 15-game unbeaten run in all competitions, and came just four minutes after Ibrahimovic had equalised from the penalty spot.

After ousting Chelsea from the Champions League after extra time in midweek, PSG players looked tired and lost precious points in the fight for the title.

Ibrahimovic had twice equalised for PSG in Bordeaux, the first from a Javier Pastore pass

Chasing an unprecedented quadruple, PSG - who lost stalwart defender David Luiz and midfielder Yohan Cabaye through injury - are facing a hectic schedule in the coming weeks and still have to travel to play arch rivals Marseille this season.

'We came back late on Wednesday, we were tired both physically and mentally,' PSG midfielder Adrien Rabiot said. 'This is not an excuse, but it's difficult, even though we are professionals.'

Ibrahimovic had already put the teams level in the 50th minute from Javier Pastore's through ball after Lamine Sane jumped higher than Thiago Silva to open the scoring with a fine header to Sirigu's right.

Midfielder Wahbi Khazri then restored Bordeaux's lead from close range, pouncing on Kiese Thelin's glancing header after fluffing his first attempt on goal.
