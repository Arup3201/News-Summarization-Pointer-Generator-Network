Sashaying out of the Dorchester Hotel in London last night, the Duchess of York made sure all eyes were on her - and her figure-hugging black leather dress.

Cinched in at the waist and paired with black heels, it showed off her newly slimline figure to maximum effect.

The Duchess was at the hotel's China Tang restaurant to celebrate the birthday of old friend Sir David Tang, who joined her as she left the building alongside other guests.

All eyes were on Fergie as she left the Dorchester hotel last night in a racy black leather dress

The Hong Kong businessman is well known on the social scene and owns the high end Dorchester hotel as well as having interests in fashion.

The Duchess, who recently celebrated her 55th birthday, has endured a very public battle with her weight over the years.

Now slimmer than ever, she showed off a toned set of biceps in the sleeveless dress and wore her glossy mane of red hair youthfully loose.

Chatting happily with Sir David and other guests, the Duchess appeared on cheerful form, which based on recent events, she had good reason to be. 

The Duchess opted to forgo a jacket despite the chilly evening, showing off her slimline figure to full effect

Along with winning her battle against the bulge, the mother-of-two has relaunched her literary career, in another bid to boost her finances.

Her new book, Fergie's Farm, is based on her childhood in the Hampshire countryside, featuring a band of friendly farmyard characters.

More good news came her way when the Queen allowed her to hold a charity gala at Windsor Castle - a sign, say royal watchers, of a return to the fold.

The 55-year-old looked noticeably thinner than we have seen her in previous years  

Gone were the more dowdy clothes we have become used to seeing on the mother-of-two 

Accessorising only with a simple black crocodile clutch bag, small stud earrings and a watch Fergie seemed to have had a good evening
