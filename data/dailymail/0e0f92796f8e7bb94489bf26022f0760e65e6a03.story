Convicted fraudster Colin Fell plundered almost £400,000 of company cash to live the life of a wealthy 'country gentleman'

A greedy managing director who stole company money and lived the high life of a ‘country gentleman’ whilst his staff was made redundant was today ordered to pay back more than £400,000.

Already a convicted fraudster, Colin Fell set up fake PR and advertising firms to divert money into his own bank accounts.

The 54-year-old refrigeration business boss used the money to pay for renovations of his half million pound farmhouse, luxury holidays and private schooling for his two children.

His £527,000 home on moorland near Rawtenstall, Lancashire included stables, horses and a fleet of quad bikes.

The extensive thefts forced the owners of the refrigeration firm ran to make stringent cost cutting and ultimately led to the majority of the staff being made redundant.

Mr Fell was given six months to pay back over £400,000 at Liverpool Crown Court today.

A total of £560,000 went missing from international commercial refrigeration firm Norpe UK.

When the loss was discovered Fell tried to frame a colleague by claiming the senior figure knew of his illicit activities.

Fell of Roe Green, Salford, was caught after Norpe UK made an internal investigation which exposed the phantom firms which had invoiced Norpe for non-existent advertising and promotional campaigns.

It also emerged that Mr Fell had already served time for a £1m fraud in the eighties for which he served four years.

After admitting stealing £390,000 between 2003 and 2006 Mr Fell was jailed for four-and-a-half years at Manchester Crown Court. Allegations relating to another £170,000 were not proceeded with.

Liverpool Crown Court ruled today that he is to be was given six months to pay back £410,092.29 under the Proceeds of Crime Act - or face another four years in jail.

Greater Manchester Police said the amount took into account the loss of revenue for the company on the stolen proceeds.

Ian Horrocks, Financial Investigator said: ‘Fell helped himself to thousands of pounds by deceiving the system.

‘He lived a life of luxury as a result and, meanwhile, other ordinary people trying to make a living were left jobless as the firm went through stringent cost-cutting measures to off-set the missing money.

‘Fell has now lost the wealth he made off the backs of the company that employed him.

‘Today’s result once again demonstrates that we will not stop until criminals have paid back their debt to society and their victims - in this case the company.’

Fell began working for Norpe UK in Stockport, the UK subsidiary of Norpe - a Scandinavian refrigeration company, in 1996 and was in a position of trust as managing director.

But Fell set up bogus companies and invoicing Norpe for products and services that were non-existent including technical support, public relations campaigns and trade exhibition services.

In attempts to cover his tracks he invented a series of different personalities behind the firms as well as even crashing Norpe’s accounting systems by deleting incriminating records.

He had hoped that his thefts would go unnoticed because the company was making losses.

Norpe’s international financial 
director brought in a forensic accountant in November 2006 after 
receiving complaints about the management of its UK branch and 
identifying some irregularities with suppliers.

Fell was immediately suspended and the
accountants discovered a number of forged and falsified invoices and 
called in police in October 2007.

It took the inquiry team until 
February 2010 to get to a stage where they were able to arrest Fell due 
to the complexities involved in the theft of the money.

Fell failed to accept any responsibility for his actions during a series of interviews and falsely claimed at one stage that a senior figure at the firm had known what he had been up to.

He maintained his innocence until his trial in June 2011 at Manchester Crown Court where he pleaded guilty to seven counts of theft on the first day.

The court heard that Fell had been 
jailed for 42 months in the 1980s after defrauding finance companies he 
worked for in a plant machinery scam although there is no evidence that 
he hid this conviction from bosses at Norpe.

Passing sentence upon Fell Judge Clement Goldstone QC said ‘This was a massive breach of trust.

‘You
were given a golden opportunity to get back into the world of commerce 
and yet you abused it. You did not learn your lesson from your first 
experience of prison.

‘When 
it suits you, for your own purposes, you can be utterly and shamefully 
dishonest with no thought for the consequences as far as others are 
concerned.’

Mr Fell has since split with wife Susan.

Fell was disqualified from acting as a company director for seven years.
