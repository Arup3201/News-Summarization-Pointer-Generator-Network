It was once a 5-star resort swarming with happy guests but now the former Hyatt Regency has been transformed into a Clive Palmer shrine, with pictures of himself covering the walls, several in-house Palmer TV channels and more dinosaurs then guests.

When purchasing the hotel in 2011 for an estimated $6.5 million, billionaire Clive Palmer promised his newly renovated seaside resort would lure cashed-up Chinese visitors and make for a better economy, The Courier Mail reported.

Now, nearly three years on Palmer Coolum Resort would be seeing minimum return on his self-claimed $2 billion injection into the property, producing nothing but a ghost town, according to Channel Nine's program, A Current Affair.

The ACA footage shows dirty and decaying pools, deserted restaurants, an empty golf course and facilities closed due to 'maintenance'.

In February this year, The Australian reported the Sunshine Coast's resort was at a loss of $500,000 a month, resulting in 90 job cuts and forcing remaining staff at Palmer Coolum Resort to work long hours and inter-changing jobs.

Daily Mail Australia attempted to contact the Palmer United Party leader and Palmer Coolum resort, who responded with 'no comment'.

Facilities in the Sunshine Coast resort have been closed for 'maintenance'

In ACA's hidden-investigation, workers at the resort admit it is 'short of staff', 'a bit pricey' and 'a quiet time'.

And although demand is low at Palmer Coolum Resort, the price stands quite high, with rates for a standard room between $230 to $350, a tub of Ben and Jerry's ice cream $25 and a pad thai priced at $30.

Guests on Tripadvisor.com.au describe the resort 'at best, a three star job', meals 'over priced and pool', 'staff were fine but like skittish deer and rarely seen' and 'guests were pretty thin on the ground too.

Clive Palmer took to Twitter in defence of his resort, calling for termination of A Current Affair.

Palmer retweeted Pat Orr's comments against the Channel Nine program

“Run Down.Very Dated. Overpriced.”

We felt like we had stepped into a weird movie. It was eerily quiet and seemed abandoned. Gardens were a mess and infrastructure old and tired.The ever present Palmer propaganda was subconsciously disturbing.Prices were outrageous and definately did not reflect the hotel experience we thought we were going to get. Skeleton staff were friendly.Kids loved the dinosaur park.We expected an Australian experience in Ned Kelly restaurant but there was nothing except a portrait of Ned Kelly on the menu in the whole restaurant that themed the room. But there was a picture of the Titanic...and photos of Clive of course! - kristalgee, from Gold Coast Queensland

“Old and tired”

Visited the resort for a conference. As one drives in it is very obvious that thus place needs a good spruce up to its former glory. Conference venue was adequate. Staff were friendly and our food tasted were catered for. Even us Vegos! I just kept noticing things that needed doing around the place, the paint that needed refreshing, paving askew, buildings looking tired. - Bossyonbike from Hervey Bay, Queensland

“If you want 5 stars this isn't the place - doesn't live up to its own website”

We went for 1 night and noted the following;Cannot stay a full 24 hours checkin at 2pm, checkout at 10am; free internet does not exist, costs at least $12.95; the meals were incredibly overpriced with a 15% surcharge on Easter Saturday; $10 surcharge for room service; the rooms were tired and the air con didn't reach the rooms; the advertised spa was closed and the water spas empty; even the hair dryer didn't work.Overall this place was over priced and disappointing, not delivering what it advertises. We will not be returning. - Betsy W from Redbank, Australia

“Has not been maintained”

Having visited this Resort many times under the Hyatt banner, I thought I would give it another try. Really disappointing to see a lovely Resort so run down. The rooms have not been kept up, the property looked scruffy - all the little boutique shops have closed down. - aussiekiwi_boy from Sydney, Australia
