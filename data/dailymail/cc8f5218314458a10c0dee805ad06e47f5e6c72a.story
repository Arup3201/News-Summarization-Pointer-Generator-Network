Long-distance swimmer Diana Nyad completed a 48-hour lap-marathon in a pool set up in New York City's Herald Square.

Nyad started the marathon on Tuesday to raise money for Hurricane Sandy Relief.

When the Swim for Relief fundraiser wrapped up Thursday morning, she had raised more than $103,000.

For a good cause: Nyad, a native New Yorker, raised more than $103,000 in aid for Hurricane Sandy

'It honestly was tougher that I ever imagined it to be,' said the 64-year-old Nyad as she came out of the pool shortly before 9am.

After emerging from the pool, Nyad was fed fluids intravenously while she bundled up in blankets.

Nyad recently became the first person to swim non-stop from Cuba to Florida without a shark cage, finishing the 110-mile feat in 53 hours.

Warm again: Nyad was quickly bundled up in blankets after two-straight days in the cold water

Refueling: After getting out of the pool, Nyad had to be fed intravenously with fluids

Chilly: Nyad speaks with Good Morning America's Robin Roberts after the swim. She said if she were to swim a marathon like that again, it would be during warmer months

During her Florida to Cuba swim, Nyad had to wear a full body suit and a special face mask at night to evade the deadly jelly fish.

This week's swimming race, in a 40-foot pool in Midtown Manhattan, was much safer by comparison.

Still, it was a 'long two days' for Nyad.

Big fans: Several celebrities stopped by to support Nyad during the Marathon event, including Twilight star Nikki Reed, above

Morning show swim: NBC's Natalie Morales donned goggles and a swim cap to join Nyad in the pool

'I was constantly chilly,' she said. 'If we do it again we'll do it earlier in the year, like Labor Day.

But it was all for a good cause, and one close to the New York native's heart.

'I think my real point here was, regardless of whether you're from New York, we, the citizens of the world, can't forget these people because a year ago the storm ravaged their lives,' she said.
