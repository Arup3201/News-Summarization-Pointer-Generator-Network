The letter highlights the award on offer for information that leads to the arrest and conviction of the man responsible for a series of bank robberies in the Adelaide Hills. 

It is the third time the bank has been targeted, with police saying there are striking similarities between the robbery and 10 others between 2004 and 2009.  

Detectives said there were similarities between the recent incident and prior robberies carried out by the man known as the Bicycle Bandit. 

'While there is a striking resemblance between this month's robbery and the Bicycle Bandit, we remain open-minded about who may have carried out this crime,' Detective Superintendent Peter Harvey said.

'While we understand the community will speculate on whether the Bicycle Bandit was responsible, we'll be following up every line of enquiry and every piece of evidence, no matter where it takes us.

'Someone is bound to have seen something that can assist the investigation. This was a brazen robbery were shots were fired. It is extremely lucky no one was injured,' he said.
