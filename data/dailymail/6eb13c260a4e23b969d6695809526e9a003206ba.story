These may look like old masterpieces but with an iPad featuring in one, it becomes clear they are new modern takes on classic artworks.

Photographer Derek Galon has painstakingly recreated some of history's most famous works using real-life models and giving them a modern twist.

He crafted the scenes by selecting props, costumes and even suitable models to look like the original work.

The photographer, from Victoria in Canada calls the body of works 'Painterly' and features scenes ranging from raucous taverns to gruesome dentists.

Mr Galon said: 'When I studied fine arts, I was fascinated by old masters such as Rembrandt, Caravaggio, Titian, Brouwer.

'I went back to fascinations of my younger years, creating a series of images in a painterly style. These are not copies of old masterpieces, but an homage to their timeless excellence.

'My images take the essence of old canvasses - from early paintings of mythological characters, through masters of chiaroscuro, through romantic imagery of Pre-Rapahaelites - up to Surrealism.'
