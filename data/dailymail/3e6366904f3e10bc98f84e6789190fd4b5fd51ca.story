It’s been almost 20 years since Barack and Michelle Obama tied the knot - and they last night celebrated in style at a $150-a-head restaurant.

The U.S. President and First Lady visited Restaurant Eve, in Alexandria, Virginia - located just seven miles southwest from the White House.

The Obama couple married on October 3, 1992, in Chicago, so their actual 19th wedding anniversary is tomorrow.

President Obama had been speaking at an event for a major gay rights organisation on Saturday night before going out to dinner.

He returned to the White House briefly after the speech before his motorcade made its way to the upscale restaurant in Virginia.

Restaurant Eve’s chef Cathal Armstrong has worked with Mrs Obama to promote healthier eating for children, reported the Washington Times.

Mrs Obama said earlier this year that the couple’s secret to long-lasting marriage is laughing and not taking themselves too seriously at home.

Mr Armstrong has previously cooked for television chef Julia Child and Senator Ted Kennedy, reported Irish Central.

The restaurant is named after Mr Armstrong’s first child with his wife Meshelle and is located in a converted warehouse from the late 1800s.

Restaurant Eve has two ‘dining experiences’. One is the 34-seat ‘Chef's Tasting Room’ with prix-fixe tasting menus costing up to $150.

Mr Armstrong's signature dishes include the heirloom tomato tart with garden basil and butter poached Maine lobster with Eastern Shore corn.

It also has ‘The Bistro’, featuring main courses priced up to $41 and a prix-fixe three course menu on Friday and Saturday nights for $65.

Desserts include the gianduja French toast and apple doughnuts.

'Restaurant Eve' tweeted: 'Love people who have great palates and dine with us... especially uh... THE PRESIDENT AND HIS BEAUTIFUL WIFE!!!'
