Bayern Munich seem to believe they are fit and ready to take on Borussia Dortmund in the German Super Cup - with Dante and Jerome Boateng in particular keen to show off their physique.

The German giants clash at the Westfalenstadion on Wednesday evening and Bayern were pictured having their team photograph taken ahead of the match.

In the photos, Dante and Boateng appear to be pulling their shirts tight at the back, seemingly in an attempt to look buff for the cameras.
