Smoking in a car carrying children will become a criminal offence after MPs last night backed a ban in the Commons by a large majority.

In an historic vote, Tory and Lib Dem MPs backed plans to make it illegal to light up in a car in England, punishable by a £60 fine or points on a motorist’s licence.

It came after Prime Minister David Cameron the ’time has come’ for a ban, brushing aside claims from his Lib Dem deputy Nick Clegg who branded the ban illiberal and unenforceable.

MPs have overwhelmingly backed a bill which will make smoking in cars containing children illegal by next year

The new law will apply to anyone carrying children in a car, not just parents.

MPs voted by 376 votes to 107, majority 269, in favour of an amendment to the Children and Families Bill which gives the Health Secretary power to impose a ban.

It is expected to come into effect before the election, most likely in April next year.

The move was first introduced in the House of Lords by the Labour party, and coalition parties were given a free vote which means they can vote with their conscience and not the party line.

During 90 minutes of debate in the Commons supporters of the legislation insisted it was vital to protect children from the dangers of second hand smoke.

Tory health minister Jane Ellison said the success of the new law would be measured not by the number of fines issues but ’by the reduction in exposure to second-hand smoke’.

Labour's shadow health minister Luciana Berger Labour MP Luciana Berger proposed the ban, arguing that laws governing seat belts and smoking in public places were criticised as unenforceable but had been very effective.

She said last night: ‘This is a great victory for child health which will benefit hundreds of thousands of young people across our country. It is a matter of child protection, not adult choice.’

Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg (pictured visiting Burrowbridge in Somerset this morning) branded the law unenforceable and illiberal

Mr Clegg said the police could not be expected to enforce a ban on smoking in cars, likening it to controlling what children eat or watch on TV

But opponents said it was further evidence if the ’nanny state’ seeking to interfere in the private lives of drivers.

Tory
 MP Anne Main condemned the ’illiberal, nonsensical legislation’ adding:
 ’I fundamentally believe we should not be making bad, unenforceable 
law.’

Fellow Conservative, Shipley MP, Philip Davies said the law was ’yet another in a long line of triumphs for the nanny state’.

He
 accused Miss Berger of representing the ’smug, patronising excesses of 
New Labour who think that the only reason they have come into Parliament
 is to ban everybody else from all the things that they don't happen to 
like themselves’.

Just hours before tonight’s vote Mr Cameron gave the ban is support.

Lib Dem Chief Secretary to the Treasury said he would back the ban, putting him at odds with Nick Clegg

London Mayor Boris Johnson said the 'bossyboots brigade' were right to want to ban smoking in cars carrying children

Three
 years ago the Prime Minister said he was 'not sure whether it is 
possible to legislate in that area' and called for a 'change in 
attitudes'.

earlier today Lib Dem health minister Norman Lamb said he hoped the ban would be law before the 2015 general election

But today Downing Street made clear that while Mr Cameron
 understands the ’concerns’ that some have expressed, he believes that 
’the time for this kind of approach has come’.

However, Mr Cameron is spending 24 hours touring flood-hit communities in the South West so missed the vote.

Among
 Tories, Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt, Transport Secretary Patrick 
McLoughlin and Education Secretary Michael Give were among senior 
ministers supporting a ban.

London Mayor Boris Johnson appealed to 
fellow Tories to accept that the 'bossyboots brigade' he so often rails 
against were right in this case.

’These kids cannot protest, and very
 often the smoker in the vehicle lacks the will to stub it out,’ he 
wrote in the Daily Telegraph.

’This law would give that smoker that 
extra legal imperative to obey their conscience and do the right thing.'

Ahead of the vote senior Tories including Eric Pickles and Kenneth Clarke voiced doubts about it.

Among
 Lib Dems, Mr Clegg - who is a smoker - said that ‘as an old-fashioned 
liberal’ he believed that ‘laws and legislation are not always the 
solution’.

He said it was wrong to ‘subcontract responsible parenting
 to the state’ and likened it to the police going ‘into people’s homes 
and saying “turn the televisions off”’.

However, Lib Dem Chief Secretary to the Treasury Danny Alexander and Lib Dem health minister Norman Lamb backed the ban.

Ken Clarke, the cigar-smoking minister without portfolio, said police would not spend their time checking if people were lighting up in cars

Split:  Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt said he
would back the ban, but Lib 
Dem Business Secretary Vince Cable committed to voting against it

Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt is to back a ban, after previously warning it was not the state's tole to dictate what people do in private

Nick Clegg,
 the cigarette-smoking Deputy Prime Minister:‘A family speeding along 
the M4 and mum or dad are smoking, how on earth are you going to 
properly enforce that?’ 

Ken Clarke,
 the cigar-smoking minister without portfolio: ‘I don't think our 
traffic police are going to be concentrating enormous efforts on racing 
up and down the motorway peering into cars, trying to see whether 
there's a child in.'

Communities Secretary Eric Pickles: ‘My initial intention is to vote against it. We should make things criminal if we feel that they are enforceable.’

Public Health Minister Jane Ellison: ‘We are not persuaded that legislation is the right way forward on that matter.’ (November 2013)

Chief Whip Sir George Young: ‘I see some difficulties in trying to enforce a ban on all smoking in cars.’ (November 2011, when Commons leader)

Prime Minister David Cameron:
 ‘Whatever people have done in the past, the facts show that they really
 should change their behaviour. I am not sure whether it is possible to 
legislate in that area - we need a change in attitudes.’ (March 2011)

Penny Woods, chief executive of the British Lung 
Foundation, said: 'Nearly half a million children are exposed to 
second-hand smoke in cars every week, putting them at risk of illnesses 
ranging from colds and ear infections through to asthma attacks, cot 
death, and meningitis.

'Bans on smoking in cars carrying children are
 already successfully enforced in countries like Australia, Canada and 
South Africa.’

The toxic fumes deployed from smoking in a care are 11 times more concentrated than lighting up in an open space.

An
 opinion poll in 2012 by YouGov found that 80 per cent of all adults and
 65 per cent of smokers backed a ban on smoking in cars with children 
under 18.

A Department of Health survey found 300,000 children a year
 visited GPs in England every year with problems linked to second-hand 
smoke.

Passive smoking is linked to respiratory infections such as pneumonia and chest infections in youngsters.

It can also trigger asthma attacks in sufferers and contribute to sudden unexpected infant death.

Last week Ken Clarke, the cigar-smoking minister without portfolio, dismissed the plans as ‘gesture politics’.

He
 added: ‘We do keep creating new traffic offences. I don't think our 
traffic police are going to be concentrating enormous efforts on racing 
up and down the motorway peering into cars, trying to see whether 
there's a child in.

‘We do create too many traffic offences, I really
 do think it's gesture politics. We'll probably find two or three people
 fined a year. It makes the lobbyists feel better.’

Every
 year 160,000 children are adversely affected by second-hand smoking, 
costing the NHS in England more than £23 million, the Royal College of 
Physicians (RCP) said.

John Britton, chair of the RCP's tobacco 
advisory group, said: ‘The evidence shows the importance of protecting 
children from passive smoking, and cars are still a major area of 
exposure.

‘Such exposure is widely associated with adverse health 
effects, including an increased risk of respiratory and allergic 
symptoms.’

But Simon Clark, director of the smokers' group Forest, said he was disappointed but not surprised' by the decision and accused the Government of being 'spineless.

He added: 'Legislation will have very little impact because so few adults still smoke in cars carrying children. Those that do will carry on because it will be very difficult to enforce.

'Government has banned smoking in public places. Now they're going to ban it in a private place.

'The home will be next.'
