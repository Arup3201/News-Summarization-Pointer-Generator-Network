Move over Harrods, there's a new luxury shopping centre in town and Chanel kaiser Karl Lagerfeld is at the helm.

The Chanel creative director today transformed his catwalk into a high-end supermarket all in the name of fashion at his AW14 show in Paris.

Cara Delevingne, a favourite of the French fashion house, was joined by Chanel newcomer and fashion's new darling (and little sister of Kim Kardashian) Kendall Jenner on the catwalk.

Karl, well known for his theatrical shows - which have previously featured giant icebergs and even an underwater kingdom - transformed the French capital's Grand Palais into the world's chicest and most luxurious grocery store.

Shopping 'baskets' were adorned with the label's famous chains, as seen on their luxury handbags, and models pushed trollies around the 'supermarket' as they perused the Chanel-branded food - such as haute Ketchup, eau de Chanel and Jambon Cambon, named after the location of Chanel's original store.

Kendall, who has no doubt made Kris Jenner proud with her fashion week debut, posted a picture of Chanel's spaghettini on Instagram with the caption: 'Lifetime supply please? #Chanel.'

The models were treated to a quirky hairstyle courtesy of supremo Sam McKnight who created tweed dreadlocks for the models' hair to match their outfits.

Clothes came in the form of classic cocoon tweeds, which Karl does so well, bubblegum pink cut-out matchy two-pieces, slouchy leggings and floral print trainers, often knee length. Chanel's catwalk proved that the sports luxe trend shows no sign of abating and we're adamant that Rihanna and Rita Ora will be rocking those high trainers in no time.

Perfect attire for your next trip to Sainsburys, right?
