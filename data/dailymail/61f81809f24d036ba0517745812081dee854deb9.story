Liverpool have offered Glen Johnson a new two-year contract, but the deal is worth half his current wage.

The right back is out of contract at the end of the season, and the Anfield club have now made the England international an offer.

But the deal is worth in the region of £60,000-per-week, 50 per cent less than his current £120,000-per-week salary.

Sportsmail understands Johnson is reluctant to accept the club's current offer, casting doubt on his future at the club.

Johnson can start pre-contract negotiations with foreign clubs in January, and it is looking increasingly likely that he will leave Liverpool at the end of the season.

Italian club Roma have shown an interest in the former Chelsea defender.

Liverpool are in the midst of a contract renewal drive, with securing the future of starlet Raheem Sterling the club's most pressing concern.

Like Johnson, captain Steven Gerrard is out of contract in the summer and is set for contract extension talks.
