Liverpool have announced the signing of England striker Rickie Lambert from Southampton on a two-year contract for a fee in the region of £4million.

The deal completes a remarkable comeback for the Scouser, 32, who was a part of the club's academy set-up for five years before being released as a 15-year-old in 1997.

Lambert then spent 13 years in Leagues One and Two with Blackpool, Macclesfield, Stockport, Bristol Rovers and Southampton before consecutive promotions with the latter brought him to the Barclays Premier League for the first time at the age of 30.

'I can't believe it,' Lambert told the club's official website. 'I've loved this club all my life. I left here 17 years ago - and I haven't stopped loving it since.

'I have always dreamt of playing for Liverpool, but I did kind of think the chance of playing for them had gone. I didn't think the chance would come.

'I know how big Liverpool are - and it means everything to me - but I know what is important; I know it's what I do on the pitch and the minutes I play. I know that's what matters, and that's what I'll be focused on.'

Lambert's arrival at Anfield came as a surprise, especially considering manager Brendan Rodgers had previously off-loaded Andy Carroll, who is also considered to be a target man, early on in his tenure.

However, the Liverpool boss believes Lambert is a different kind of player and is confident he can fit in to the system while also providing another option if required.

'I've seen Rickie Lambert over the years and he's one of those players that probably never got the recognition for what a really good footballer he is,' Rodgers said.

'It's only late on in his career - at 29, 30, 31 - that people are really starting to focus on his qualities.

'He was probably seen as the traditional big No 9, a British striker that is good in the air.

'But he's one of the most accomplished footballers I've seen.

'It has been so refreshing that he's got his call into the England team, and he certainly hasn't let anyone down - he has been outstanding.

'Look at his touch, look at the level of his goals, the different types of goals he has scored over his career, and he's a specialist on penalties as well.

'I think he is a terrific footballer and any team he plays against, he's always a handful.'

The initial rejection by Liverpool hit Lambert hard, as he admitted earlier in the season: ‘I was at Liverpool from age 10 to 15 and I was basically told I wasn’t good enough, which obviously was a hard thing to take at the time.

'I thought it was the end of the world. But I can tell people in the same situation that it is not the end of the world. It should drive you on to succeed even more.'

Lambert goes with the blessing of Southampton, whose chairman Ralph Krueger said: 'On behalf of the club, I would like to thank Rickie. He served with distinction and helped to take Saints from League One to the Premier League.

'Rickie has been a shining light in Saints’ growth and will forever remain an icon in the history of the club. He leaves with the best wishes of everyone at Southampton and will always be welcome back at St Mary’s.'

Southampton legend Matt Le Tissier added on Twitter: 'Good luck and thanks for a great 5 years Rickie Lambert.'

And Robbie Fowler, who knows a thing or two about scoring goals for Liverpool, posted: 'Welcome home Rickie...'

After his departure was confirmed, Lambert penned an open letter to Southampton.

He said: 'Thank you to all the staff involved in making me the player I am today. Without your knowledge and commitment I would not be here right now at a World Cup with England.'

Lambert added: 'When I grew up there was 
only one club I loved. I can honestly say now I have two clubs which 
will always be in my heart and that is thanks to the Saints fans.

'The people who support this club have been nothing short of amazing towards me and, when I look back in years to come, it will be the relationship I had with the fans here which will stand out the most.

'Southampton have allowed me to realise a lifelong ambition by joining Liverpool FC and taking my family home. The five-year plan when I arrived was to get this club from League One to the top half of the Premier League. Against all the odds we have achieved that.'

Lambert is currently in Miami with England's World Cup squad, alongside his new Liverpool team-mates Steven Gerrard, Jordan Henderson, Glen Johnson, Daniel Sturridge, Raheem Sterling and standby defender Jon Flanagan.

Southampton duo Luke Shaw and Adam Lallana are also in the squad.
