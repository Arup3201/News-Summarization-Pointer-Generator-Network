Prime Minister David Cameron supports the comments made by the Director-General of MI5, who criticised The Guardian's expose on spycraft

David Cameron yesterday joined the attacks on the Guardian for publishing secret files that have put national security at risk.

The Prime Minister threw his full weight behind MI5 director-general Andrew Parker who has warned the leaks are a ‘gift’ to terrorists.

MPs and security experts weighed in too, claiming the newspaper had exposed the UK’s intelligence secrets to Islamist fanatics and foreign spies.

They said Guardian editor Alan Rusbridger had been naive to think it was harmless to publish the documents stolen by fugitive US agent Edward Snowden. Security sources pointed to remarks from the UK’s deputy national security adviser suggesting damage has already been done to Britain.

Oliver Robbins, who reports directly to Mr Cameron, warned that revealing the techniques GCHQ uses to spy on terrorists may cause ‘widespread loss of life’.

A No 10 spokesman – when asked whether Mr Cameron agreed with Mr Parker’s comments – said: ‘The Prime Minister thinks it was an excellent speech and we are, as you would expect, always keeping under review the measures that are needed to contribute to keeping our country safe. I would happily point you to all parts of the director general’s speech.’

In another development, there were last night accusations of editorial bias at the BBC, which initially ignored the scathing criticisms of the Guardian.

The corporation later offered Mr Rusbridger an interview on Radio Four’s World at One to defend his paper.

He denied putting lives at risk and – defying security officials – said he would continue publishing top secret information, which the paper has been splashing across its front pages since June.

Mr Rusbridger, who critics claimed was given an easy interview, said: ‘We are working slowly and responsibly but as we discover further stories that we think merit the debate, the debate that everyone says is necessary, then we will go on publishing.’

Security officials and MPs dismissed the suggestion that the newspaper was capable of knowing what would and would not assist Britain’s enemies.

They pointed to a devastating legal submission drawn up by Mr Robbins in August.

He said: ‘It is impossible for a journalist alone to form a proper judgment about what disclosure of protectively marked intelligence does or does not damage national security.

‘The fragmentary nature of intelligence means that even a seemingly innocuous piece of information can provide important clues to individuals involved in extremism or terrorism.

‘There is therefore a real risk that that publication or disclosure could cause unintended damage to that national security.

‘It is worth reiterating the point that real damage has in fact already been done to UK national security by the media revelations (both in the UK and internationally).’

He said the leaking of the kind of top secret information held by the Guardian was likely to ‘lead directly to widespread loss of life’ and ‘to cause exceptionally grave damage to the effectiveness of security of the UK’.

Sir Malcolm Rifkind, chairman of Westminster’s intelligence and security committee, also backed Mr Parker’s speech, which contained a warning that several thousand fanatics living in Britain see the public as a legitimate target.

The former foreign secretary dismissed the idea that Snowden or journalists at the Guardian could judge which information it was safe to publish.

‘When we know that Snowden has over 50,000 classified documents relevant to UK interests the idea that he or others would be able identify which are damaging to national security is naive,’ he said.

‘Even knowing the technology that is available to GCHQ or MI5 or MI6 is valuable. Some of these terrorists are very, very smart. It’s not like the old days when communication could only be by letter or telephone call.

‘Unless they [the security services] are at the cutting edge of modern technology they will be behind the terrorists who are smart on encryption and trying to conceal what they are doing.’

Charlie Edwards, of the respected Royal United Services Institute, claimed the Guardian had been ‘wrong’ to ‘deliberately expose’ the UK’s intelligence secrets.

He said: ‘The leaks we have seen from Snowden in the Guardian will provide information to terrorists, but also aggressive foreign intelligence agencies operating in the UK.’

The independent MP Patrick Mercer, a former Downing Street security adviser, said intelligence data should not be published if it compromised public security.

In August, police detained David Miranda, the partner of Guardian journalist Glenn Greenwald, for nine hours at Heathrow airport. Mr Miranda had been carrying intelligence files leaked by Snowden

‘If in any way our security is compromised by revealing too much, that’s a mistake,’ he added. ‘Just imagine if we had revealed the whole Enigma secret during the Second World War.That might have been in the public’s interest – but we’d have lost the war.’

Mr Robbins’ remarks were made in a submission to judges in the case of David Miranda, the partner of Guardian journalist Glenn Greenwald, who was stopped at Heathrow in possession of at least 58,000 classified stolen documents.

He had been ferrying them from a Snowden associate in Germany to Brazil, where he shares a home with Greenwald, the author of many of the controversial articles.

Mr Robbins said the material was ‘highly likely to describe techniques crucial in life-saving counter-terrorist operations, and other activities vital to UK national security’.

Snowden is currently holed up in Russia, with temporary political asylum.
