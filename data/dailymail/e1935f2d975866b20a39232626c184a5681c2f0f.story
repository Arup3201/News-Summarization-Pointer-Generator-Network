Hospital staff are being bribed to work more hours amid fears the NHS faces its worst-ever winter.

Nurses, physiotherapists and other health workers are being offered bonuses of up to £65 – on top of their overtime pay – if they work longer shifts.

The measures have been brought in amid concern that A&E units are facing a ‘toxic’ combination of staff shortages and a steady rise in sicker, frailer patients.

The Great Western Hospital in Swindon, Wiltshire, is paying staff a £65 reward every time they work overtime in a desperate bid to overcome the winter crisis

Yesterday the NHS’s medical director 
Professor Sir Bruce Keogh admitted that there were already signs this 
winter would be worse than previous years.

He told Radio 4’s Today 
programme: ‘Winter is going to be a particular issue. We have to address
the problems coming up this winter and we have to address the 
longer-term problem.’

Sir 
Bruce, who next week will publish a report setting out how A&E 
services must be improved, acknowledged there was ‘a feeling that this 
year is worse’ in terms of the pressures on A&E units.

The
£65 payments are being offered to staff at the Great Western Hospital 
in Swindon if they agree to work at least seven and a half hours 
overtime.

The incentive – 
for all staff except doctors – is to ensure rotas are fully covered for 
the expected surge in patients over the next few months.

Dr
Bernadette Garrihy, of the College of Emergency Medicine which 
represents A&E doctors, said: ‘We are getting ready for what may be 
our worst winter yet, and we have been warning about this for a number 
of months.

‘Now that we are 
heading into winter, when we have got severe weather problems on the 
way, increased incidence of respiratory tract infections, things like 
winter vomiting bugs – we know that this puts our departments under huge
pressure.’

A&E has had a
surge in out-of-hours cases ‘because patients aren’t able to access any
other sources of care’, she said. A shortage of beds meant patients 
couldn’t be moved to other wards, leading to ‘toxic overcrowding’ in 
some A&E units.

Government
funding to ease the pressure on A&E by paying for staff and 
services was ‘far from enough’ and a ‘drop in the ocean’, she said. ‘We 
are concerned about providing a safe and quality service this winter.’

It comes as senior doctors warn accident and emergency units nationally are at ¿tipping point¿ and face their worst crisis on record this winter

█ NHS bosses should not be criticised for their huge salaries, controversial NHS chief Sir David Nicholson told MPs yesterday.

Sir
David – who earns £210,000 a year and was dubbed the ‘man with no 
shame’ for his defiance over the Mid Staffs scandal – told the Commons 
health select committee: ‘They are amongst the most complex and 
difficult jobs in the world.’
