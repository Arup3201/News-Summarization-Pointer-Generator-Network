Spending spree: Business tycoon Ed Bazinet, 68, spent $20million on trinkets at a trade fair in New York before being hospitalised, suffering a manic episode

A business tycoon who spent $20 million on luxury gifts - including $1.6million on soap - has been taken to hospital after concerns over the state of his mental health. 

Ed Bazinet, 68, raced around the booths at the International Gift Fair in the Javits Center, New York, buying up everything he could lay his hands on.

Last month, sources said he spent $39.4 million at a similar event in Paris.

The huge sums of money that Mr 
Bazinet was spending left friends alarmed and he was taken to hospital 
yesterday, the New York Post said.

The tycoon had a manic episode and was diagnosed with bipolar disorder, a 
spokeswoman told gawker.com.

He placed orders between 
$200,000 to £2million on a variety of items.

The New York International Gift Fair 
takes place twice a year and the latest winter exhibition was attended 
by 28,000 stall holders and 35,000 visitors.

Most of the products are homeware and trinkets, ranging from kitsch pots and pans to luxury toiletries and expensive textiles.

Word quickly spread around the fair 
about the enormous sums of money Mr Bazinet was shelling out.

Designer Nima Oberoi told the Post: 'He’d just say, ''Give me 1,000 of this and 1,000 of that!''

'I feel awful for him; there was clearly something going on.'

The designer cut him off after he 
spent $200,000 on cake platters. Over at the elizabethW stand, Mr Bazinet 
ordered $1.6 million of soap, sachets and hanger covers, amounting to 
96,000 items, sources said.

The company, which sells handcrafted bedroom linens and toiletries, was unavailable for comment when contacted by MailOnline.

However one vendor told gawker.com that Mr Bazinet's assistants 'were cancelling all the orders'.

Mr Bazinet, who is originally from 
Minnesota, started his career making flower arrangements and is now reportedly worth $100million.

He made his fortune selling
porcelain Snow-baby figurines and miniature ceramic villages after seeing the lucrative market in mail-order trinkets.

He’d just say, 'Give me 1,000 of this and 1,000 of that!'

In the mid-Nineties, he sold his company Department 56 for $270 million. The firm deals mainly in hand-crafted 
collectables and holiday decorations.

It was best known for coming 
up with the original Snow Village scenes in the 1970s - hand-painted, 
ceramic models depicting winter scenes of small town America.

The multimillionaire reportedly never understood why people liked the trinkets and would stamp fan letters to him, 'get a life', according to a 2007 article.

Mr Bazinet has a lavish, 10,00 square-foot Tribeca penthouse 
worth $28 million which has 19 rooms, five floors, four terraces, 
sweeping spiral staircases and is filled with modern art. There is also a private roof garden and rooftop gym.

Bipolar disorder, or manic depression, affects moods, swinging from one extreme to another.

Sufferers often feel periods of mania, high points when they are full of energy, hardly eat and sleep - before experiencing extreme lows. 

Episodes often last for weeks or months but can be successfully managed with medication and therapy. 

Last year, it was revealed that Catherine Zeta-Jones was being treated for the condition.

The main bedroom takes up a full 
floor and has a fireplace, bathrooms, skylit walk-in closet and a 
separate Jacuzzi room, according to Luxist.com.

The
penthouse also boasts a 1,000-bottle wine storage, stainless steel and 
glass spiral staircase and private elevator connecting the floors. There
is also a media room and large library.

Mr Bazinet also co-owns a Gulfstream jet.

In a 2007 book, Richistan:
A Journey Through the American Wealth Boom and the Lives of the New 
Rich, Mr Bazinet told the author that he didn't want to live such a 
lavish lifestyle and was trying to sell his penthouse.

He said: 'It's not comfortable. 
Sometimes you don't know until you're living in a space. But this feels 
too big for two people.

'It's great when you have people for a party. But
upstairs it feels like a big fishbowl with just a few people.'

According
to the New York Sun in 2008, Mr Bazinet shares his New York penthouse 
with his partner, a Belgian photographer, and two rare breeds of cat.
