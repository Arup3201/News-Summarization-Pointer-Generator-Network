A mother bought vodka for a 12-year-old friend of her daughter to drink at a children's sleepover.

Hazel Aitchison, 26, handed a quarter bottle of the strong spirit over to the unnamed girl during a party at her home in July last year.

At Falkirk Sheriff Court, pregnant Aitchison, who is due to give birth in April, admitted culpably and 
recklessly purchasing and providing alcohol for a 12-year-old in her 
care and allowing it to be consumed at her home.

The unnamed girl was given the strong spirit by Hazel Aitchison (pictured) - a friend of the mother - who told police 'I only did it once' and had given permission.

When she was arrested and charged Aitchison told police 'I only did it once' and had been given permission by the girl's mother.

Adrian Fraser, procurator fiscal depute, 
said the young girl had been in Aitchison’s care on July 26 2013 
when Aitchison was given money to buy the alcohol.

He said: 'She went to the shop and 
returned a short time later giving the young person a quarter bottle of 
vodka and some change.

'She then allowed the alcohol to be consumed by 
the youngster in her charge.'

Elaine Lawlor, NHS Forth Valley’s alcohol
 and drug co-ordinator, said: 'Research shows the earlier a young person
 begins to drink alcohol, the more likely they are to drink in ways that
 can be risky later in life.

'Alcohol can put young people at serious 
risk of harm. Current scientific evidence states that an alcohol-free 
childhood is the healthiest and best option.'

Minister for Public Health, Michael 
Matheson, said: 'It is extremely irresponsible for any adult to purchase
 alcohol for someone so young. Alcohol can cause serious damage to a 
young person’s health and these actions are simply unacceptable.'Aitchison

A Police Scotland spokesman said: 'Individuals aged over 18 should never purchase alcohol for those under the legal age and we will investigate all circumstances where it is suspected an adult has supplied youths with drink.

'Retailers are also reminded to be vigilant for anyone attempting to proxy purchase and report any suspicions.'

Sheriff John Mundy deferred sentence for six months for Aitchison to be of good behaviour.
