'Buy fewer clothes' is hardly the cri de coeur you'd expect from a woman who has made her name - and her career - from selling them.

But today Dame Vivienne Westwood made exactly that extraordinary plea - and directed it particularly at 'poor people'.

The eccentric designer sat among celebrities and fashion journalists in the front row for her s/s14 show at the German Gymnasium in north London, instead of waiting backstage as usual.

It meant she had pride of place for the dramatic opening, which saw supermodel Lily Cole performing an interpretative dance while wearing a flowing, Grecian-style gown.

Speaking out: Dame Vivienne Westwood advised people to buy less clothes at her Red Label show during London Fashion Week SS14 yesterday

Speaking after the show, Dame Vivienne pleaded: 'Buy less. Choose well. Make it last. Quality, not quantity. Everybody’s buying far too many clothes.

'I mean, I know I’m lucky, I can just take things and borrow them and I’m just okay, but I hate having too many clothes. And I think that poor people should be even more careful.

'It doesn’t mean therefore you have to just buy anything cheap. Instead of buying six things, buy one thing that you really like. Don’t keep buying just for the sake of it.

'I just think people should invest in the world. Don’t invest in fashion, but invest in the world.'

Act: Lily Cole said she had been nervous about her modern dance debut, which she had devised with the help of a friend, but said collaborating with Dame Vivienne was 'not even work'

Dame Vivienne also urged people to take more of an interest in culture, saying: 'The first thing they can do, if they live in a town, is they can go to art galleries.

'Start building different values, where you engage with the past, with the human race.'

The Vivienne Westwood Red Label collection for spring/summer 2014 saw models, their faces caked in black and white make-up, wearing the designer’s trademark tartan, embellished with oversized corsages.

Eco-friendly: Vivienne Westwood often uses clothes to make political statements, as in this instance

There were also English country garden prints and T-shirts printed with the phrase: 'Climate Revolution', the designer’s political and environmental message making its mark on the catwalk.

Those watching included Hollywood actress Anna Kendrick and singer Paloma Faith.

Cole said she had been nervous about her modern dance debut, which she had devised with the help of a friend, but said collaborating with Dame Vivienne was 'not even work' as she enjoyed it so much.

'I’m doing it for the love of it... and to try to communicate the values we both believe in,' said Cole.

'I also did it because it scared me. I’ve never danced live before. I think it’s important to challenge yourself in life.'
