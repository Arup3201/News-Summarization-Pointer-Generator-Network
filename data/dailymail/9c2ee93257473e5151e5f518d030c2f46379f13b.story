It was in a perfect location with easy access and no other takers.

So when this estate agent saw the tempting Galaxy bar during a property viewing, he decided to move in and take immediate possession.

The 25-year-old, identified only as George, was spotted on camera last week stealing the treat as he showed prospective tenants around a flat.

Greedy: The estate agent, who was wearing a purple suit, entered the flat in Walthamstow, east London

Shocking: 'George' took the large Galaxy bar while showing prospective renters around the property

He makes sure the clients are out of sight before grabbing the chocolate bar and slipping it into a pocket in his purple suit.

The
 theft was caught on a covert security camera installed in the property 
by its current tenant, Jon Charter, who was testing the device for a 
house he is moving to.

After
 seeing the agent steal the chocolate, which had been bought for him by 
his wife as a birthday present, he called the police.

George
 has since claimed in text messages that he was ‘desperate’ for sugar 
because he felt faint but his bosses have fired him.

Yesterday
 Mr Charter, a 42-year-old operations manager, said: ‘I was testing the 
cameras out and happened to check them when I was at work.

‘I couldn’t believe what I was seeing. I know it is only a chocolate bar, but it is the principle.

‘It is the fact he did it in my flat, the cheek. It is outrageous.

‘Estate
 agents are not the most popular of people at the best of times but 
you’d never expect something like this. We don’t know what else he stole
 from me or others without CCTV. It just destroys whatever trust you may
 have.’ Mr Charter has lived in the flat in Walthamstow, East London, 
for ten years but has given notice because he is buying a home in Essex 
for him and his wife of one year, Cissy Wang, 32.

Caught: It just so happened that new secret security cameras were being tested at the home in the capital

Fired: After the incident the agent apologised and said he was 'embarrassed and ashamed' by what happened

Mr
 Charter called the police and started a campaign on Facebook to shame 
the man and demand an apology from his firm. He posted the video online 
and wrote: ‘Talk about steal of the month, watch your staff steal from 
me.’

George responded by 
sending Mr Charter a series of text messages, saying how ashamed and 
guilty he felt. Yesterday George told the Daily Mail he felt Mr Charter 
had been unreasonable: ‘He’s annoyed for no reason. I know it is a 
serious matter and I wouldn’t want anyone taking anything from my flat 
but I think he is being petty.’

George said he tried to apologise with a bottle of wine and flowers but Mr Charter would not listen.

‘I
 suffer from fainting and dizziness,’ he added. ‘I have fainted ten or 
15 times and I’m only 25. I was busy at work and I just needed sugar at 
that time.’

George has been sacked by Your Move Sterling & Co, where he had worked for about a year.

Manish
 Somani, director of the firm, said: ‘Action was taken and the employee 
is no longer working for us. The landlord has fully accepted this 
apology and the tenant has accepted a payment as a goodwill gesture.’

No arrests have been made.
