While Louis van Gaal was being unveiled on Thursday, two Manchester United old boys were putting thoughts of Old Trafford behind them.

Rio Ferdinand, released by United at the end of the season, wrapped up his move to Queens Park Rangers by signing a 12-month contract.

And former United boss David Moyes was soaking up the sunshine as he watched the first round of The Open at Hoylake.

He told BBC 5 Live: ‘I am playing much better golf than I have for a long time. I think everyone knows why that is! It’s been a long time since I’ve had any time off and I am enjoying it.’

Ferdinand was looking forward to extending his Premier League career with Harry Redknapp’s side after signing a deal worth up to £70,000-a-week. The move reunites Ferdinand with Redknapp, who gave the former England star his senior debut at West Ham in 1995.

Ferdinand, 35, has been involved in deals worth close to £50million and was one of Redknapp’s top targets as soon as QPR were promoted.

He told the QPR website: ‘I spoke to Harry and (owner Tony) Mr Fernandes at length. I think they both looked me in the eye and knew that I still have something to offer; that I had a genuine desire to come here and play football.’

‘I had a lot of offers from all over the world - some in places with a better climate than here. But the draw for me was to play in the Premier League. It’s not about money - I had loads of more lucrative offers available to me.

'I still feel I’ve got something to offer and I’m excited about helping this club cement its place in the Premier League.’

Redknapp said: ‘I really couldn’t be more pleased. Rio’s a fantastic player and a great professional. I’m delighted we’ve been able to bring him here.’

Redknapp hopes Ferdinand’s arrival will be the catalyst for several more purchases before his side’s opener against Hull City on August 16.

He is hoping to land Ajax striker Kolbeinn Sigthorsson after having a £4.8m offered accepted by the Dutch side.

Redknapp on Thursday night said a deal has been agreed for Cardiff central defender Steven Caulker, who is wanted by Crystal Palace.
