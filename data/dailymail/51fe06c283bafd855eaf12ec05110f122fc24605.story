Alton Nolen, the Muslim convert accused of beheading a female colleague in Oklahoma last week, has been charged with first-degree murder in the gruesome killing.

Nolen, 30, was also charged with assault and battery with a deadly weapon for the grisly attack at Vaughan Foods in Moore last Thursday, Cleveland County prosecutor Greg Mashburn said. The DA added that officials will likely pursue the death penalty in the case.

Nolen was fired from his job on Thursday after Traci Johnson - a co-worker he later attacked - said she had had an altercation with Nolen 'about him not liking white people', Mashburn said.

Nolen then allegedly returned home and fetched a knife and 'returned to get revenge', the prosecutor said.

The criminal complaint released today states that Nolen drove to his home 'for the sole reason to retrieve a large bladed knife'. He then went back to work 'with the large knife in his shoe, in order to assault an employee of the business with the knife.' 

He walked into the plant's administrative office and came across 54-year-old Colleen Hufford, whom he attacked from behind, severing her head. 

He then turned his attention to Johnson, 43, whom he cut across the left side of the face and also tried to behead. She survived. 

Nolen was eventually shot by the company's CEO Mark Vaughan but survived his wounds.  

The affidavit adds that he 'openly admitted to "beheading" the first victim with a knife and cutting and attempting to "behead" the second victim with the knife'. 

He faces two assault charges in relation to Johnson and Vaughan. 

Mashburn said it was 'highly likely' that he would seek the death penalty against Nolen, but would confer first with Hufford's family.

While the FBI is investigating his links to Islam, and while he believed Nolen was using Arabic terms during the attack, Mashburn said the attack seemed to be tied more to the complaints against him.

'It had more to do with race rather than trying to convert people,' Mashburn said. He said there was a 'back and forth with Ms. Johnson and that led her to make a complaint to the HR department.'

'There was some sort of infatuation with beheadings. It seemed to be related to his interest in killing someone that way,' the prosecutor said. 'Other than that, it seemed to be related to his being suspended earlier in the day.'

On Nolen's Facebook page, listed under the name Jah'Keem Yisrael, he posted photos of Osama bin Laden and Taliban fighters, along with posts condemning a variety of aspects of American life.

Posts ranged from religious iconography to stock photography to even photos of supposed UFO activity. It also included a graphic photo of a beheading.

Convert: Nolen, who had recently converted to Islam, was 'infatuated' with beheadings, prosecutors said

Today the MailOnline visited the apartment where Nolen has been living alone for the past year.

The rundown block called The Colonial Apartments is on the north side of Moore just a few miles from the Vaughan Foods factory.

Neighbors said Nolen was ‘extremely quiet’ and rarely conversed with others in the low income neighborhood.

Retired mechanic Fred Fletcher, 61, who lives underneath Nolen’s $450 a month rented unit, said the suspected killer ‘blanked’ him every time he said hello.

‘I tried to be friendly and said hi on at least three occasions, he didn’t even turn his head, he looked straight through me.

‘He moved in less than a year ago, but you never heard much from him, he went to work in his SUV and came home, he never had any visitors, he was a loner.

A maintenance man at the block said Nolen behaved ‘oddly’ after he tried to enter his apartment to fix a broken air-conditioning unit.

The man, who would only give his name as Dwayne, said Nolen refused to let him in unaccompanied as if he were 'hiding something'.

Dwayne said: 'His air-con needed unclogging and he wouldn't let me have access, it felt like he was trying to hide something. He wouldn’t let me in without him being there. 

'He wrote in the book in the manager’s office that it was because of "religious reasons", because he's a Muslim.

'I thought it was odd as I've done work in a lot of Muslim people’s homes and they have never had a problem. I got the impression he wanted his privacy.’

Dwayne said Nolen generally lived a solitary life and spent his time surfing the web on his laptop.

He said Nolen’s apartment was ‘spotless’ when he was finally allowed access to do repairs.

‘He kept it very clean and tidy with everything in its place,’ said Dwayne.

‘The floors were clean, all the kitchen counter tops were clean, extremely neat, and he had cleaning products on top of the refrigerator. He asked you to take your shoes off before you entered.

'Alton didn’t own a TV, instead he had a mat on the floor where he would sit on his laptop.

'I didn’t see any Islamic pictures or material as you might expect, his walls were covered in peaceful photos of scenery, nothing radical.

'He even had flowers in a vase on the coffee table, it was a nice place.'

Another neighbor Mildred Adair, 68, said Nolen was extremely friendly with her even helping her lift a heavy shopping cart up some steps and into her apartment. 

'He was nice to me, he helped me with my shopping and on a few occasions,' the retiree said.

'I saw him at the laundry-mat and we spoke. He seemed nice, not someone capable of killing.' 

Nolen's family members have said that they were surprised to learn of his conversion and never spoke about Islam explicitly with them.

'I spoke to him once he was released, and when we spoke, there was nothing of the sort,' said Nolen's cousin, James Fulsom, from Fort Worth, Texas. 'I don't believe he was converted (to Islam) in prison.'

As recently as February, Fulsom said that when he talked to Nolen there was no mention of his conversion.

'He was just talking about what he was going to start doing, how he was going to get his life on track, and was ready to be focused on his future,' Fulsom told the Associated Press.

A spokesman for an Oklahoma City Islamic group said Nolen had attended services at a mosque where sermons were delivered condemning such attacks.

'In no way, shape or form did he represent Islam in this foolish act,' said Saad Mohammad, director of information for the Islamic Society of Greater Oklahoma City.

He added that he remembers the suspect was 'a little weird'.

'He acted a little odd,' Mohammed said, though he added that Nolen's behavior never raised any 'red flags' since he began worshiping at one of the group's centers in May. 

Nolen's mother and sister posted a video message on Facebook over the weekend saying they were shocked and saddened by the allegations against him.  

'My son was raised up in a loving home. My son was raised up believing in God,' his mother, Joyce Nolen, said in the video. 'Our hearts bleed right now because of what they're saying Alton has done.' 

Oklahoma prison records show Nolen was released from prison in March 2013 after serving two years of a six-year sentence on charges that included assaulting a police officer and possession of cocaine with intent to distribute.

Nolen received no misconduct reports during his incarceration at five separate facilities, Department of Corrections spokesman Jerry Massie said. Nolen completed his probation in March of this year.
