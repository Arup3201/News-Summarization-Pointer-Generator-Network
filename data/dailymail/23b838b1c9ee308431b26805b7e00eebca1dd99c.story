Two men have appeared in court today charged with the murder of 'lovely' builder Tanis Bhandari, as a post-mortem revealed he died of a stab wound to the back.

Mr Bhandari, 27, a former member of the Royal Navy, was killed in the early hours of New Year's Day as he made his way home from the King's Arms pub in Plymouth.

Ryan Williams, 21, and Donald Pemberton, 20, appeared at Plymouth Magistrates' Court this morning charged with his murder.

The pair, from St Budeaux, Plymouth, Devon, also faced two separate weapon possession charges relating to an axe and knives.

No pleas were entered by the pair.  They stood in the dock and spoke only to confirm their names, addresses and dates of birth.

They were remanded in custody by Plymouth magistrates and will next appear on Wednesday before a judge at Exeter Crown Court.

Plymouth coroner Ian Arrow opened and adjourned the inquest into the death of Mr Bhandari today.

He noted that the 27-year-old's body had been formally identified by his step-father, Steven Sharpe, who had raised Mr Bhandari  since he was just seven-years-old.

Home Office pathologist, Dr Amanda Jeffery, concluded that the cause of death was a 'stab wound to the back of the chest'.  

A 21-year-old man remains in hospital with serious injuries following the alleged attack outside the Kings Arms pub in the village of Tamerton Foliot, Plymouth. 

The incident took place at around 1.30am on New Year's Day.

Mr Bhandari was rushed to nearby Derriford Hospital in Plymouth by ambulance but died shortly afterwards. 

Following the incident three other men were taken to hospital for treatment and are now recovering at home. 

Police said the two defendants may face further charges as the murder inquiry continues.

Hundreds of mourners have left floral tributes outside the pub where Mr Bhandari was killed.
