They have lived through two World Wars, seen 25 prime ministers enter Downing Street and toasted the birth of Queen Elizabeth II.

Leslie Green and his wife Elsie are celebrating a remarkable year after both reaching their 100th birthday milestones.

Elsie, who has a passion for horses, celebrated her centenary yesterday - six months after her husband of 72 years received his birthday card from the Queen.

Staff at their care home in Upton, near Norwich, threw a party for the couple and released 100 green helium balloons into the sky.

Lisa Evans, care co-ordinator at Broadland Park residential home, said: 'Elsie was aware earlier on in the week that it was her birthday, but she was a little surprised when we said she was 100!

'They have been quite excited. I think they keep each other going.'

The couple, who were both born the year before the First World War started in 1914, met in the village of Scottow in Norfolk in 1933.

'Excited': Elsie, who celebrated her centenary yesterday, worked in horse shows, before retiring aged 65

They tied the knot on February 15, 1941 - at the height of the Second World War - before going on to have three children - Mary, 74, Jean, 71, and John, 66.

Mary put her parent's long lives down to 'plain food' and a good work ethic.

'They only had plain food, no fancy stuff,' she said. 'They used to have potatoes, corned beef and bread and butter.

'And dad used to work all hours on the land - I've never known him have a holiday.'

Leslie, who was born in Brandon, Suffolk, and had a staggering 21 brothers and sisters, was spared military service fighting the
Nazis because he had a deformed hip.

He worked as a stockman at a farm, where he fed horses, milked cows and drove steam rollers.

'The chap who owned the farm had no tractors or anything,' said Mary. 'It was all horses in those days.'

Elsie, who was born in Scottow, worked at horse shows, before retiring at the age of 65.Â 

The couple, who moved into the care home in April last year, are now looking forward to the next big day - Leslie's 101st birthday in April.
