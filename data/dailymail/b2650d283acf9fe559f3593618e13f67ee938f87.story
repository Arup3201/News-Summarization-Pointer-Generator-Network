Former basketball superstar Michael Jordan, 50, is going to be a father again. The father of three married Cuban-American model Yvette Preito, 34, seven months ago in Palm Beach, Florida.

The pair have been a couple for five years after meeting at Miami nightclub in 2008.

On April 27, the couple got married at Episcopal Church of Bethesda-by-the-sea and then had a $10 million dollar reception at Bear's club in Jupiter, Florida.

Us Weekly reports that Among the star studded party guests were Tiger Woods, Patrick Ewing and Spike Lee. There were several performances throughout the night from Usher, Robin Thicke, K'Jon, an 18 piece band called The Source, and DJ MC Lyte.

They shared their first dance to K'Jon's 'One the Ocean.'

ET reports that the wedding tent was 5,000 square feet larger than Jordon's 35,000 sq ft home and is the 'largest wedding tent in history.'

Preito stunned at her wedding in a 'French silk voile corseted sheer sheath gown by J’Aton Couture, in an ecru palette with accents of flesh tones, with handmade silk lace created especially for her, and enhanced with Swarovski crystals. The gown featured French seamed crinoline borders, which cascaded into a dramatic cathedral train finished in the lace, with accents of a peacock-feathered design,' reported ET.

A source told People Magazine, 'They’ve 
been planning for months and months,' a source told PEOPLE of the 
couple’s all-out wedding. 'He wanted to give Yvette everything she’s 
ever wanted.'

This will be Jordon's fourth child. Jordan has three children from his first 17-year-marriage to Juanita Venoy. The couple split in 2006.

He has two sons named Jeffrey Micheal,24, Marcus James, 22, and one daughter named Jasmine, 20. Jordan has spoken openly about how hard it must be to be his child because of the expectations involved.

In his hall of fame speech in 2009, he said to his family, 'I wouldn't want to be you guys.'

Yahoo News reports that Marcus had a brief dance with playing basketball, but he is quoted as saying, 'my heart wasn't in it.'

His son Jeffrey also played basketball for a while but quit for 'personal reasons.'

Jasmine Jordan who is a student at Syracuse University has been rumored as gay after photos of her and a female basketball player surfaced on instagram, reported The Grio.

Her twitter profile reads, 'Proud daughter of Michael Jordan. Born into a legacy and yet it does not define me.'

What's to come of Jordan's next child remains a mystery.
