The now-dead subject of an Oscar-nominated film is causing an argument  - and it is not about whether the documentary about her will win.

A messy legal fight over who owns the rights to photos shot by Chicago nanny Vivian Maier is raging and the copyright battle threatens to slow, or even stop, new releases of her once-unknown work.

Maier, whose life is chronicled in Oscar nominee 'Finding Vivian Maier,' died penniless five years ago.

Prints of photos taken by nanny Vivian Maier (above) began selling for thousands of dollars after her death 

Maier's work became so popular that a documentary about her, Finding Vivian Maier (pictured), was made

John Maloof bought a storage box at auction stuffed full of Maier's photo negatives for $400 in 2007

She died with no will, no obvious heirs and no inkling that the more than 150,000 photographs she snapped in her spare time in Chicago and New York from the 1950s onward would become so prized. 

Maier's intimate and often-gritty photography, which she made no attempt to sell commercially in her lifetime, focused on everyday people.

Since interest in her work exploded, prints of her photographs have sold for thousands of dollars.

Now, two men Maier never knew are tussling over who holds the rights to print, sell and display the images she created.

Center stage in the dispute is John Maloof, a 33-year-old former Chicago real estate agent who features in and co-directs the documentary. 

He bought a box full of Maier's negatives at auction for $400 from a repossessed storage locker in 2007. 

Maloof now owns the vast majority of her work, more than 100,000 images, that are mostly in negatives or undeveloped film. 

He traced Maier's whereabouts in the Chicago area in 2009, just days after she died at age 83.

Maloof defends his project — now his full-time job — of managing his Maier collection.

Years going through negatives, and paying for professional restorers and printers has cost him hundreds of thousands of dollars. 

Until recently, he either lost money or just broke even.

He said: 'My life is 100 percent on this project.

'It is a blessing and a curse.'

It was Virginia-based David Deal, a longtime commercial photographer who read about Maier as he completed a law degree, who sparked the legal fight by filing a notice in a Chicago probate court last summer. 

Deal's filing identifies a relative of Maier's in France, retired bureaucrat Francis Baille, as Maier's closest relative — a first cousin once removed. 

Deal claims that makes him Maier's rightful heir. 

Maloof believes he has copyrights because a different Frenchman he contends is Maier's closest relative, Sylvain Jaussaud, signed over the rights to him.

Deal argues that Maloof should have launched probate proceedings himself years earlier to establish who Maier's heirs were.

He says it is Maloof's own fault Maier's growing ranks of fans could be deprived of much of her work.

Deal said: 'We wouldn't be in this position today if he'd not cut legal corners.'

Maloof calls that accusation 'garbage'.

He claims a probate proceedings filing wasn't required. 

But once Deal took that step, it set off a drawn-out legal process. 

To avoid the legal headaches, an owner of a far smaller collection of Maier's photography sold it all to a Canadian gallery. 

Maloof has no intention of doing that. 

He said: 'They don't want to shut us down. I am confident something can be worked out.'
