Wallace and Gromit would be proud.

Inspired by the hit cartoon films, this contraption can produce your breakfast in one minute, and it's just in time for Shrove Tuesday.

Commissioned by the happy egg co., the aptly-named 'Pancake-omatic' took a team of four design engineers more than 200 hours to construct and a further 100 to test.

The device will go on display at the Design Museum later this month and uses a wide selection of household objects including an old-style gramophone and an electric whisk and features a luxury nest throne for the hen to lay her egg in. 

Eggstra-special! Inventors have designed a contraption that Wallace and Gromit would be proud of which turns freshly laid eggs into pancakes in a matter of minutes

The happy hen, sitting on her throne, lays her eggs, which then roll down the chute towards the pancake-making part of the apparatus

The pancake-making process starts with the hen laying an egg in her five-star nest.

The egg drops down from the throne and rolls down the wooden chute.

Reaching the bottom of the chute, the egg pushes a wooden spoon, which winds up a gramophone.

When the music starts, the egg is dropped into a holder on the spinning record, then swung around and cracked into a bowl containing other pancake ingredients. 

The egg, laid just seconds before, is poised above a fearsome-looking blade before being cracked and dropped into the bowl and mixed into the batter

When the music starts, the egg is 
dropped into a holder on the spinning record, then swung around and 
cracked into a bowl containing other pancake ingredients.

The bowl moves down a conveyor belt 
where the mixture is whisked and then released slowly into a hot pan. 
The pancake is cooked for 30 seconds, flipped and placed on a plate.

The machine may look like it was invented by Aardman character Wallace but another similar egg contraption appeared in children's classic Chitty Chitty Bang.

Shrove
Tuesday takes its name from being shriven, or forgiven of all your 
sins. It is the day before Ash Wednesday, when the sombre season of Lent
begins.

Splash! The batter is tipped into the waiting frying pan

As Lent is a time 
of fasting, it became traditional to use up rich food - milk, butter and
eggs - before switching to the more austere diet deemed appropriate in the period of fasting ahead of Easter.

The bowl moves down a conveyor belt where the mixture is whisked and then released slowly into a hot pan. The pancake is cooked for 30 seconds, flipped and placed on a plate.

Here's how to make the perfect pancake if you don't have a Pancake-omatic at home. 

Make the batter by mixing 4oz plain flour with two eggs, 7fl oz of milk diluted with 3fl oz of water, a pinch of salt and 2oz of butter.

Sift the flour and salt into a large mixing bowl. Make a well in the centre of the flour and break the eggs into it. Begin whisking the eggs. Gradually add small quantities of the milk and water mixture, still whisking.

Whisk until all the liquid has been added and the batter has the consistency of thin cream.

Melt the butter in a pan. Spoon two tablespoons of it into the batter and whisk it in.

Use the rest of the butter to grease the frying pan before you make each pancake. Get the pan really hot, then turn the heat down to medium.

Ladle 2 tbsp of the batter into the hot pan all in one go. Tip it around from side to side to get the base evenly coated with batter.

After about half a minute, and when the bottom is golden in colour, flip the pancake over. The other side will only need a few seconds to cook. Slide the pancake out of the pan on to a plate.

Shrove Tuesday takes its name from being shriven, or forgiven of all your sins. It is the day before Ash Wednesday, when the sombre season of Lent begins.

As Lent is a time of fasting, it became traditional to use up rich food - milk, butter and eggs - before switching to the more austere diet deemed appropriate ahead of Easter.

One of the best recipes for using up those rich foods is pancakes, and so the tradition was born.

In other countries Shrove Tuesday is known as 'Mardi Gras' - or Fat Tuesday - and is marked by carnivals, a final chance to let your hair down before the solemn season of Lent.

Claire Jappy of the happy egg co. said: 'Pancake Day is a much-loved tradition so we wanted to do something that would celebrate this annual festivity - and champion the role our hens play in making pancakes.

'Hen happiness is at the heart of everything we do - because happy hens lay tasty eggs - so our contraption is the ultimate for pancake lovers wanting to enjoy a truly fresh pancake.'

Dermot Doyle, design engineer of Helix design production, said: 'It's no mean feat to create a machine that will break an egg let alone flip a pancake so this project has been a really exciting challenge for the team.

'We hope we've cracked it and our machine encourages others to make their very own egg-inspired inventions.'
