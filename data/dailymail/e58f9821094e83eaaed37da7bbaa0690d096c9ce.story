Valencia remain the preferred choice of Darren Fletcher despite West Ham's overtures to the Manchester United midfielder.

Key to his move is the departures of Manchester City loanee Bruno Zuculini, Filipe Augusto of Rio Ave and Javi Fuego.

Zuculini has been offered to Getafe on loan while Augusto is ready to return to Portugal and Fuego, an influence in the dressing room, is looking for a better contract elsewhere.

An added complication is that Valencia coach Nuno and sporting director Francisco Rufete are slightly at odds over what the team needs but they are pressing to lose those three to make room for Fletcher.

Fletcher has been asked to stay at Manchester United where Louis van Gaal and Ed Woodward see him as an important member of the current squad and the club's future off the pitch.

Despite the emotional pull though he wants to play and at 30 believes, health permitting, he has a lot still to give.

West Ham have pushed hard to sign him and he has offers from West Brom and Celtic plus another Premier League side.

Valencia have been talking to Fletcher's representatives since before Christmas and have picked up the thread of those early conversations in recent weeks, convincing Fletcher they want him to play a significant role. 

They splashed out on Benfica's Enzo Perez which shed some doubt on the need for Fletcher but now Fuego has asked to go.

The 31-year-old has even been offered to West Ham in recent weeks and wants to move as he is on a relatively poor contract compared with that of his team-mates.

Fletcher likes the idea of a move to a different league and the lure of Valencia with their history and new business project is the most appealing.

Chelsea have sounded out Fiorentina over Juan Cuadrado's availability.

The move comes as they consider offers for their first-team fringe forwards with Wolfsburg still in the race for Andre Schurrle and Roma and Fiorentina discussing deals for Mohamed Salah.

Cuadrado has a £26.8m release clause and Fiorentina are reluctant to deal for anything less. The 26-year-old Colombian has not been in the best form but was an option for Jose Mourinho when he was at Real Madrid.

The clubs have held discussions in recent days and Chelsea winger Marko Marin has cut short his loan at the Italian club, leaving Fiorentina to join Belgian champions Anderlecht.

Mourinho will look for a new signing should Wolfsburg and Roma come up with concrete bids for his players and Cuadrado is in his thoughts.

West Ham have been quoted £4m for Nigeria defender Azubuike Egwueke and will need to restructure their offer for Scotland Under 21 international Stephen Hendrie.

The club had a £500,000 offer rejected last week for the 25-year-old who they see as a potential replacement for wantaway centre-back Winston Reid.

West Ham have also been told they will need to revise their offer for Hamilton left-back Stephen Hendrie.

Hamilton have turned down an initial offer in the region of £2m for the 20-year-old who is regarded as one of the best young prospects to come out of Scotland in years. Hendrie is expected to follow a similar path to Hull's Andy Robertson who joined in the summer from Dundee United and has been a big success in his first season prior to injury.

Celtic, Swansea and Crystal Palace have all watched Hendrie but West Ham have made the step of making an offer as they want back-up to Aaron Cresswell.

Norwich City, managed by former Hamilton boss Alex Neil, are also keen as Martin Olsson has asked to go in a bid to push through a move to Swansea.

Stephane Mbia is looking to return to the Premier League on a free transfer.

The Cameroon international holding midfielder is on a short-term contract with Spanish side Sevilla but has an agreement with the club that he can leave in this window.

Crystal Palace and Everton have already had tentative talks with his representatives and the 28-year-old is ready to make the move back to England where he has retained a flat in Chelsea.

Mbia had a spell at Queens Park Rangers in 2012 after joining in a swap deal that saw Joey Barton go on loan to Marseille. Rangers suffered as their large influx of new players failed to gel and they were relegated. However, Mbia went on loan to Sevilla where he showed his ability and helped guide Sevilla to Europa League victory over Benfica, scoring his penalty in the shootout.

He was named in the Europa League team of the year and was nominated for best African player in the Spanish league.

His agent Jean-Paul Ndoumin said: 'Stephane signed a short-term contract with Sevilla as he wanted the opportunity in this window to discuss a return to the Premier League. It is a league that excites him and one he believes is the most challenging and he likes a challenge. 

'He feels the Premier League didn't see the best of him at QPR and he wants to put that right. He doesn't want to wait until the last minute he is ready to move now.'

Several Premier League sides are searching for a holding midfielder and Mbia has the attributes. He can also sign a pre-contract for the summer.

Tottenham are close to agreeing a deal with Swansea City for defender Kyle Naughton.

Talks have been ongoing over recent weeks and now look close to drawing to an amicable conclusion.

Swansea remain in the market to bring in a striker on loan amid concerns over the future of Bafetimbi Gomis. They are awaiting an improved offer from Crystal Palace for Neil Taylor and will wait on that before pressing ahead in a deal for Norwich's Martin Olsson.

Palace are continuing to discuss a bid for Rudy Gestede at Blackburn although the striker trained alongside team-mates on Tuesday morning as he waits for the deal to be struck. Palace had a £3.5m offer rejected last week.

The agent of Arsenal target Marcelo Brozovic has confirmed interest from 'major English clubs'. Everton

Talking to Europacalcio.it, Miroslav Bicanic dismissed reports the Dinamo Zagreb and Croatia midfielder would be joining Napoli. He said: 'I deny what has been said in the last few days, it’s not true that he will go to Napoli. I have not heard anything from the club.

'There are offers from major English clubs, but right now I will not name names.'

Leeds United are showing an interest in Celtic striker Anthony Stokes. The former Arsenal and Sunderland forward is keen to move back to England and Leeds want him to help steer them out of their current malaise. 

The difficulty is that they are under a transfer embargo so any deal would have to be done on an initial loan.

The 26-year-old has scored eight goals this season and also attracted interst from Cardiff.

Wolves club captain Sam Ricketts has been made available for loan by manager Kenny Jackett.

The 33-year-old has only made five appearances this season with his last game against Brentford on November 29.

Asked about allowing him out on loan, Jackett said: 'Yes we would, but no-one’s come in for him and Sam hasn’t been jumping up and down to go out.

'Sam’s been out of the picture and, with younger players showing the form they have, first-team prospects are slim.'

MK Dons and Rotherham are showing an interest in Chesterfield's Charlie Raglan. The 20-year-old defender, who was playing for FC United 18 months ago, only joined in April last year and was seen by Paul Cook as one for the future. However, his performances have attracted attention from other clubs who also see potential in the former Port Vale trainee.

Meanwhile, Chesterfield midfielder Romuald Boco has left the League One club to join Indian side Bharat FC.

The 29-year-old Benin international joined the Spireites in the summer on non-contract terms and scored one goal in 19 appearances.

Everton teenage striker Chris Long has joined Brentford on loan.

The England Under 20 international is highly rated at Goodison but manager Roberto Martinez wants him to pick up more experience.

Long, born in Huyton, has been at Everton since he was five. He came on as a substitute in Everton's Europa League tie against Krasnodar at the end of last year and has impressed in pre-season but his only other league experience came at MK Dons last season when he scored one goal in four games.

Long is quick and composed and likes to take a shot on from outside the box as he proved in pre-season against German side Paderborn.

He joins high-flying Brentford on a youth loan and manager Mark Warburton is looking to add further signings before the window closes to bolster his promotion push.
