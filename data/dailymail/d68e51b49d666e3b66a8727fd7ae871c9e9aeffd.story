Andrew Flintoff, looking lean and bowling quickly, was back training with Lancashire at Headingley on Tuesday, five years after his retirement.

Flintoff, 36, joined in all the drills before the third day of their Roses match against Yorkshire and bowled off his full run-up.

He could even come back, as first revealed in The Mail on Sunday, in Twenty20 this week against Durham and Birmingham, but Lancashire still want him to play a second team game first.

Famous face: Andrew Flintoff will make his comeback to cricket for Lancashire in the T20 Blast

Putting his back into it: Flintoff will play a 2nd XI game for Lancashire next week and will then play in the T20s

Returning hero: Flintoff's comeback was first revealed by Sportsmail

Jimmy Anderson said of a comeback for 
his England and Lancashire colleague: ‘I would be in favour, of course, 
if he was fit and bowling well.

'With someone who has been out of the game for so long, the issue would be fitness and getting up to match intensity.’

Flintoff,
 whose return had been delayed by an ankle injury suffered in fielding 
practice two weeks ago, may play for the second-string side against 
Glamorgan next week.

And
 if that goes well, he would have an appetising target to aim for — 
Lancashire’s Roses NatWest Twenty20 Blast game against Yorkshire at Old 
Trafford on June 6.

In his years away from cricket, Flintoff has explored other options - including one bout of professional boxing.

He
 represented England in 79 Tests, 141 one-day internationals and seven 
Twenty20 games. He also made 80 first-class appearances for the Red 
Rose, scoring 4,042 runs at 35.14 and taking 92 wickets at 29.16.

Flintoff's
 Lancashire Twenty20 record consists of 16 games, averaging 13.94 with 
the ball and 29.64 with the bat, with a high score of 93 against 
Derbyshire in 2009.
