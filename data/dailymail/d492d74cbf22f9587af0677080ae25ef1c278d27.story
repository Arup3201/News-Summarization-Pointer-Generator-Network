An unlucky pensioner could be forced to tear down his £1 million home after it was struck by lightning.

Since his wife Denise died two years ago, 79-year-old Tony Tubb, from Bexhill-on-Sea in Sussex, has battled cancer twice, had his home of 40 years burgled and had all his late wife's jewellery stolen.

But just as things were starting to look up for Mr Tubb following his second cancer all clear, his home was struck by lightning - which blew a four-foot hole in the ceiling just above his bed.

Mr Tubb barely escaped with his life, as fire tore through his family home before three fire crews managed to extinguish the blaze.

He has now been told that the house he raised his two children in could have to be torn down because of structural damage.

Mr Tubb is now waiting to hear if the house needs to be torn down due to structural damage caused by the fire

Even if his home can be saved, the unlucky pensioner has already lost most of his prized possessions, and will have to find £250,000 to pay the repair bill.

Mr Tubb said: 'When lightning hits something it can cause enormous damage. It has been very upsetting.

'The house might have to be rebuilt - I am waiting to hear what the structural engineer says about it.

'It could be that the house itself is not safe enough to live in, in which case it would be a waste of money to start doing repairs.

'So I will leave it to the experts to establish whether or not the house is repairable.'

The lightning tore the four-foot hole in the roof above his bedroom on October 6.

He added: 'They say lightning doesn't strike twice, but in a sense it has hit me twice because of the burglary last year.

'Someone said to me I'd be more likely to win the lottery than be struck by lightning - what are the chances of having your house hit?'
