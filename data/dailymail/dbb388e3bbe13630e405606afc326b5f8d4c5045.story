Labour joined forces with Church of England bishops and Lib Dem rebels last night to try to wreck flagship plans for an annual limit on welfare handouts.

Ministers reacted with fury as Church leaders suggested that capping benefits at a maximum of £26,000 a year was somehow un-Christian.

The bishops helped inflict a dramatic defeat in the House of Lords, with one even invoking the Bible as he argued against the Government’s plans.

Debate: The Rt Reverend John Packer delivers his speech to the House of Lords last night ahead of the vote which saw the bishops, Labour and Liberal Democrat peers vote for an amendment to the motion

Speech: The Bishop of Ripon and Leeds, the Rt Rev John Packer, tabled an amendment which would exclude child benefit payments from the £500-a-week limit

An issue of fairness: David Cameron, pictured at a Q&A session with Asda workers yesterday asked whether it was right that people should be able to earn more than £26,000 just through benefits alone

The decision to back an amendment to the Coalition plans is a major gamble for under-pressure Labour leader Ed Miliband, who has been anxious to present himself as on the side of hard-working families who play by the rules.

A weekend poll showed 76 per cent of the public are in favour of the benefit cap, including 69 per cent of Labour voters. The YouGov survey also found that a significant minority – 36 per cent – want still tougher measures, saying no household should get more than £20,000 in welfare payments.

Gamble: Ed Miliband's decision to back the amendment could lead to problems, especially as a recent survey showed 69 per cent of Labour voters are in favour of the scheme

Despite the Lords defeat, Work and Pensions Secretary Iain Duncan Smith is vowing to stick to his guns. He branded the vote a ‘disgrace’ and accused Labour of sending a ‘very clear message they see nothing wrong with unlimited handouts’ or with a situation where claimants make more by staying at home than working.

The Coalition says workless households should not receive more than the average family in work earns after tax. Official figures published yesterday showed 67,000 households are receiving more than £26,000 a year in welfare payments and would be affected by the proposed cap.

The £26,000 figure is equivalent to the average household income of working families after tax and including any benefits.

Prime Minister David Cameron said: ‘It’s a basic issue of fairness. Should people really be able to earn more than £26,000 just through benefits alone? I don’t believe they should. And I think the overwhelming majority of people in the country would back that view.

‘The criticism I get from many people is that £26,000 is too much. You have to earn £35,000 [before tax to take home £26,000] – that’s a salary far higher than the average salary in our country.’

Mr Duncan Smith said: ‘The purpose of this is not to punish people but it is to give fairness to people who are paying tax, who are commuting large distances because they can only afford to live in the houses that they have chosen.

‘It is also about fairness to those who are on these benefits; it is not fair to trap somebody in an expensive house which they cannot afford then to go to work on the back of, because they would lose their housing benefit if they went to work – so they are disincentivised from going to work.’

But peers voted by 252 to 237, a majority of 15, in favour of an amendment tabled by the Bishop of Ripon and Leeds, the Right Reverend John Packer, which received Labour backing. Twenty-six Lib Dem peers – including former party leader Lord Ashdown – also voted against the Government.

Liam Byrne (left) told the Commons that if his 
party's 'safeguards' on homelessness were not accepted, Labour peers 
would vote against the Government in a crucial vote on amendments to its
flagship Welfare Reform Bill. Iain Duncan Smith (right) has described it as a 'wrecking' amendment

They voted to change legislation to exclude child benefit from the cap, a move which ministers say would mean some households continuing to receive as much as £50,000 from the state. They also suggest it creates a ‘perverse incentive’ for workless families to have more and more children.

Labour says it supports the principle of the cap but said it was concerned about the costs of families who might be made homeless as their handouts are reducted. It backed the bishops and said it aimed to further amend the legislation when it returns to the Commons.

Do you think £26,000-a-year benefits cap is fair?

Bishop Packer invoked the Bible as he argued against the Government’s plans.

‘Three-quarters of those affected by the cap are children,’ he said. ‘It cannot be right for the cap to be the same for a childless couple as for a couple with children.

‘Christianity, along with other faiths and beliefs, requires us to think most of those that have no voice of their own. Children are one of the most evident examples of that.

‘Children have no vote in our society. This amendment goes some way to protect them.’

But welfare reform minister Lord Freud said: ‘The worst thing for youngsters is to be in a workless household. We need to change behaviours and this benefit cap is designed to do that.

‘Like other welfare benefits, child benefit is provided by the state and funded by taxpayers and therefore we believe it is right it is taken into account along with other state benefits when applying the cap.

Twitter row: People took to the social networking site yesterday with many explaining their exasperation over the level being set at £26,000

‘The effect of excluding child benefit would simply be that families on child benefit would have an income higher than average earnings – there would be no upper limit to the amount of benefit a household could receive as that would clearly depend on the number of children.’

Labour’s Lord McKenzie said his party backed the principle of a cap, but claimed it ‘dramatically increased the prospects’ of people becoming homeless and could force councils to pick up the costs of re-housing them.

A source close to Mr Duncan Smith said: ‘Labour are an absolute disgrace and have sent a very clear message to the public that they see nothing wrong with people receiving unlimited handouts, instead of doing the decent thing and going out to work.

‘This now goes back to the Commons and we will overturn it. Labour are starting to realise they have made a rod for their own backs on this one, as they’ll have to justify their position all over again in the Commons.’

Ed Miliband has suffered a double blow in opinion polls. The latest Guardian/ICM survey has puts the Tories on 40 per cent, up three points from December and five points ahead of Labour, which has drifted down one to 35 per cent. The Lib Dems are on 16 per cent.

A separate Populus poll for The Times last night found Mr Miliband’s personal poll ratings are getting worse. While this survey puts Labour one point ahead of the Tories, the proportion of voters who ‘find it difficult to imagine Ed Miliband running the country as Prime Minister’ has risen from 63 per cent in September to 68 per cent now.
