The bizarre live-on-air gabbling by a baseball announcer about a ‘botched robbery’ and ‘henchmen’ midway through a game has provoked concern for his health.

Veteran broadcaster Dave Barnett began mumbling incoherently during the 8th inning of the game between the Texas Rangers and San Diego Padres on Monday night.

As the game reached a pivotal point, three players approached the centre of the field to discuss tactics.

Headache: Texas Ranger announcer Dave Barnett has blamed a severe migraine for his bizarre on-air rambling

Barnett then appears to say: ‘It’s discussion involving a two to one game with time on second a lead on single, by Chase Headly. 

‘Go ahead run… is at fifth on what Adams
is insisting on calling it a botched robbery. But what actually 
happened was his henchmen took piece literally out of…'

His microphone was cut off for a few moments. He returned to finish the game.

Speculation was rife about what might have caused the bizarre incident.

But
the following day Barnett spoke to local radio station 1080KRLD to say 
the incident was caused by a complex migraine, according to CBSDFW.com.

He said that he now felt fine, but has been taken off air for the next two games while doctors assess his condition.

Medical experts have said that garbling and disjointed, incoherent speech could be the sign of a deeper health problem.

On-air slip: The bizarre incident with Dave Barnett, left, has caused some to make parallels to comic weather presenter Brick Tamland, right, from the movie Anchorman

The
blooper has caused parallels have been drawn between Barnett and 
hapless weather presenter Brick Tamland, played by Steve Carell in hit 
comedy movie Anchorman, famed for his on-air slips.

The
incident had echoes of when CBS Los Angeles journalist Serene Branson 
garbled her words live on air, causing fears she had had a stroke.

Doctors later said she had actually suffered a complex migraine during a live Grammys broadcast, last year.

She is not the only anchor to have sparked concern with a live on-air incident.

A complex migraine is a specific and fairly common form of severe headache.

During the migraine blood vessels in the brain narrow - or spasm - and then dilate.

When these spasms occur certain parts of the brain may not get enough blood leading to stroke-like symptoms.

But unlike a stroke, the blood flow is not permanently interrupted during a migraine, and the neurological symptoms are nearly always temporary.

Symptoms include: Muscle weakness, a loss of vision and difficulty speaking.More than 23 million people in the U.S. suffer from migraine.

Complex Migraines are more common in women than men but affect all ages.

The
presenter on KEYC-TV in Mankato, Minnesota, had been anchoring weekend 
evening broadcasts for a year and her Sunday show had been cut down 
because of an over-running NFL game.

In one of the strangest segments, Ms 
Stensrud says: ‘Today’s event featured Christmas fo… music, food and a 
chance to meet the Santa dog.

‘They
felt three ways for Christmas…parents and grandparents,’

Ms Stensrud 
adds, as she speaks over a man giving a pre-recorded interview.

‘Sunday
night's uncharacteristic newscast on KEYC Mankato can hardly be 
considered private,’ KEYC vice-president Dennis Wahlstrom said.

‘Nonetheless,
in our judgment, the matter represents a personnel issue to be resolved
internally,’ he said in a statement on the station’s website.
