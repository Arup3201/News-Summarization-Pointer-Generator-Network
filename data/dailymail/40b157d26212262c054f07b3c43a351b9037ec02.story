Millions of women are being let down by a state pension system that treats them like ‘poor relations’, official figures revealed yesterday.

The data from the Office for National Statistics show that 80 per cent of male pensioners get the full amount of £110.15 a week.

But just 46 per cent of women receive the full state pension, which is based on National Insurance contributions.

Official statistics show just 46% of women receive the full state pension compared to 80% of male pensioners

Many women give up work to look after children and so make lower contributions.

Dr Ros Altmann, a pensions expert, said: ‘The state pension system was designed by men for men who had wives at home.

‘Women have been stung by a legacy of rough justice from the pension system. It has discriminated against women for years.’

Overall, a typical retired woman who is receiving her state pension, including additional extras, receives £112 per week.

But a man scoops £34 more per week, with an average weekly payout of £146. This is equal to nearly £1,770 more every year.

For many women, this is the difference between turning on the heating or staying cold, between visiting relatives or being stuck at home.

Malcolm McLean, a consultant from pension advisers Barnett-Waddingham, said: ‘It is clear that women are still very much the poor relations when it comes to the state pension.’

There are far more female than male pensioners in Britain, with around five million men and 7.3million women over State pension age in the UK.

To make matters worse, the ONS said one in ten retired women get ‘less than half’ of the basic state pension.

The figures follow the revelation yesterday that elderly savers are being stripped of thousands of pounds by middlemen when they retire and turn their pension pots into annuities.

Half stay loyal to the insurer they have saved with while  others turn to brokers in search of a better deal.

But a report from the Financial Services Consumer Panel found many pensioners were being charged between £1,500 and £3,350 by brokers when moving a pot worth £100,000.

The ONS also exposed the  ballooning cost of paying the state pension to Britain’s ageing population. In 2012/13, the state pension and other payouts, such as pension credit, cost the  Government £94billion.

This figure is set to explode as people live longer. Two in five baby girls born this year will live to celebrate their 100th birthdays, according to the Department for Work and Pensions.

Pensions experts say the state system was 'designed by men for men' and discriminate against women

By 2062/63, the ONS forecasts the bill will have reached £438billion, a sum the Government plans to reduce by raising the state pension age.

At present a woman can start claiming state pension at 61 and nine months. A man can start claiming at 65.

It will be increased to 65 for women by 2018. The age for both men and women will then rise to 66 by 2020 and 67 by 2028.

John Fox, director of the  pension provider Liberty Sipp, said: ‘We all know Britain is facing a pensions timebomb.

‘With these official projections, the ticking just got louder.’
