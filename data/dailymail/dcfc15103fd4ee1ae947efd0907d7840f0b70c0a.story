Dispute: Saad al-Hilli was gunned down in the Alps last year, and now it has been claimed he was arguing with an unidentified man the night before

A British man gunned down in the Alps alongside his family last year was seen in a 'heated' argument at his camp site the previous night, according to a new report.

Saad al-Hilli, a 50-year-old engineer, was shot dead in his parked car along with his wife, Ikbal, and mother-in-law near the French town of Annecy, close to the Swiss border.

Sylvain Mollier, a French cyclist, was also killed in the attack, though al-Hilli's two daughters Zeena, four, and Zainab, seven, survived. The identity of the murderer remains a mystery.

Several campers saw al-Hilli speaking with a man at Le Solitaire du Lac campsite. It is unclear what the men discussed, but sources speaking to Le Parisien newspaper said the exchange was 'heated, but it was not described as vehement.'

The source, thought to be close to the case, sounded a a further note of caution by adding that 'everyone has his own interpretation as to what constitutes a dispute according to his own culture', according to the Daily Telegraph.

The French report provided more background to the incident, saying that the al-Hilli family arrived in the area four days before they were attacked on 5 September 2012.

At first they had stayed in another campsite, but they did not like the plot they were given and moved to Le Solitaire du Lac, where they spent their final night.

French investigators have reportedly been looking in to who might have known the location of the campsite where they were staying, around eight miles from the site of their murder.

The mystery surrounding the case intensified recently when prosecutors admitted they had not been able to find the British passports belonging to Mr al-Hilli and his wife.

Eric Maillaud, a prosecutor in charge of the case, told Le Parisien: 'Investigators
searched absolutely everywhere, on the bodies, in the family caravan, 
in the house in Claygate [in Britain].

Mystery: The scene of the killing in the Alps last year, which was believed to target the al-Hilli family

Road: Mr Mollier and the al-Hillis were killed by an unknown assassin near Lake Annecy

Investigation: Police outside Mr al-Hilli's home in Surrey hunting for clues into his death

'Given the timing, it’s not impossible that the killer took the two 
passports... but that would have been tight.'

On Monday a BBC Panorama documentary was broadcast in which Mr al-Hilli's brother Zaid admitted that the two almost came to blows in an argument over how to split their father's £1million estate when he died.

Zaid, a 54-year-old accountant, never spoke to his brother again after the dispute, but denied hiring a hitman to kill him, despite a torrent of speculation.

Denial: Zaid al-Hilli said he had nothing to do with the murder, though he admitted arguing with his brother the last time he saw him

He was arrested by French police - the only person held in connection with the murder - but has been released on bail.

He said: ‘He pinned me down. I was on the bed in my bedroom and he pinned me down. That’s it. That’s all.'

Up to 100 officers in Britain and France
have been focusing on several lines of inquiry linked to the family’s 
complex background – they moved from Baghdad to Britain in 1971 – but 
the main theory remains that a dispute over the huge inheritance is 
behind the bloodbath.

Zaid also alleged that police have failed to 
properly investigate the possibility that the real target was Sylvain 
Mollier, a cyclist who was also shot dead during the attack on his 
brother.

He said: ‘They are covering up for someone in France in that region and they know it. There is something more to it locally.’

He has refused to go to France in order to be questioned by French police.

French investigators believe Mr Mollier, 45, was killed because he stumbled upon the murder scene.

The BBC programme also spoke to two witnesses, who saw a motorbike and a BMW 4x4 close to the murder scene.

The motorcyclist was said to be the likely killer, and French authorities have since announced they will release an e-fit image of the man.
