A daughter's face lights up as her dad sings Edwin McCain's Walk With You to her as he walks her down the aisle of the church on her wedding day.

The heartwarming moment is captured on video as the emotional father looks into the bride's eyes and sings beautifully while keeping his composure in admirable fashion.

The father and daughter walk hand in hand as family and friends smile broadly and take photographs of the heartfelt moment.

Magical: The father looks into his daughter's eyes as he sings and prepares to walk her down the aisle

The father stops on  a number of occasions and takes his time to reach the altar during the remarkable performance which lasts for just over five minutes.

When the pair eventually reach the top of the church, the groom is forced to be patient and wait for his bride as his father-in-law finishes the song.

After the stirring song, the dad and daughter kiss and hug each other and immediately afterwards the groom also shows his appreciation by embracing his future father-in-law.

Happy occasion: Wedding guests smile and take photographs as the pair make their way down the church
