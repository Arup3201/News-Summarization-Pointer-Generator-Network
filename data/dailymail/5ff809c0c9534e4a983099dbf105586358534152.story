Frank Lampard is set to remain at Manchester City until the end of the season after the club thrashed out a deal with New York City and had it ratified by the Premier League. 

City had been locked in high-level with talks with the Premier League on Wednesday afternoon as they looked to secure Lampard's availability for the New Years Day match against Sunderland.

It is understood that the Premier League board have now granted their approval to the amendment of Lampard's deal and he is eligible to face Sunderland tomorrow afternoon.

A club statement read: 'Manchester City can confirm that it has extended Frank Lampard's contract up to the end of Manchester City's season, enabling his participation in both domestic and European campaigns.' 

Lampard has spent the first half of the season on a short-term deal at City after signing a pre-contract agreement with sister outfit New York City FC that was due to commence on January 1.

The two clubs have now reached an agreement that allows the midfielder to remain in Manchester. He remains a contracted Manchester City player and is not at this moment associated with the New York side.

It may be viewed as a blow to the credibility of the American enterprise as the needs of Manchester appear to have been placed above the growth of New York City, after Lampard was unveiled as one of their signature signings last summer. His exact starting date in New York remains to be decided.

On Wednesday evening, City sources were not ruling out the possibility that Lampard could yet return to New York for the beginning of the MLS season in March or later on in Manchester City's season. For that to happen, the two clubs would have to agree a loan deal from Manchester City or a permanent transfer.

It appears to be a possibility that remains open for discussion, although it seems most likely that Lampard will remain in Manchester as long as Manuel Pellegrini believes he has a role to play at the club.

A New York City statement said: 'His exact starting date with New York City FC will be confirmed as the EPL and MLS seasons unfold. All parties remain in continuing dialogue to create the best outcome for all.'

The Third Rail, who claim to be the first independent supporters group for New York City FC, reacted furiously to the news on Friday.

On behalf of the Third Rail, we would like to publicly denounce City Football Group’s and Frank Lampard’s decision to extend his loan to Manchester City until the end of the Premier League season.

Many fans, including our members, decided to support the team, committed to season tickets, and bought merchandise under the impression that Frank Lampard would be playing for New York City Football Club, not Manchester City. Many of those fans are rightly outraged by this decision, and we support any course of action they take to voice their discontent over this decision.

Our support for our ownership group has been unwavering until now, but this we cannot support. We reject out of hand any suggestion that NYCFC is in any way secondary to Manchester City FC, regardless of the source, and are disappointed that City Football Group would give such an appearance.

The Third Rail will forever act as a voice for the fans of New York City Football Club.
