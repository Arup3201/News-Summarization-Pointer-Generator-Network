Parish councillors have pulled the plug on a Christmas lights switch on ceremony in a decision described as ‘health and safety gone berserk’.

The event, which usually attracts several hundred people every year, was axed by councillors in Bishop’s Cleeve, Gloucestershire who feared the village green would become overcrowded.  

Instead, the lights will be quietly switched without fanfare.

Christmas is cancelled: The Christmas lights switch-on at Bishop's 
Cleeve last year. The event usually attracts several hundred people but has been 
cancelled this year over health and safety fears

Peter Badham, vice-president of the Chamber of Commerce, said the decision was ‘health and safety gone berserk’.

He said: ‘We’re talking about responsible adults bringing children to a community event and nothing more than that. I think it’s a perfect location.

This year the switch on has been cancelled, the lights will be turned on quietly 
without fanfare. Pictured is last year's switch on.

‘In terms of space, we’ve looked at it and we think there’s more than enough room for everybody to come and have a great time.

‘There is nowhere else to go now. The parish council has really let the community down.’

In previous years, the ceremony has been held in a local supermarket car park with Santa’s grotto inside the community centre but this year the Bishop’s Cleeve Parish Council withdrew permission for the use of the centre because organisers failed to ‘sign in’ everyone who entered the building.

To resolve the issue, the chamber, which has organised the switch on for the last 11 years, suggested the event be held on the village green.

But the parish council blocked those plans on health and safety grounds. 

Chair of the parish council, Peter Lightfoot said: ‘The plans we voted against were using our little green area. The key reason for that is it’s quite a small area and normally we get hundreds to the light switch on.

‘I think the problem is that they approached us with about four weeks to go and essentially held a gun to our head and said “either you let us use the green or it won’t happen”.

‘We just can’t see how they could fit it on that particular piece of land.

‘We’re in favour of the lights. We’re just not in favour of holding it on the parish green.’

Previous fun of the fair: Crowds in the town are kept entertained but there will be no similar scenes this year after they feared too many people would turn up to the village green

Peter Badham from the chamber of commerce said it was 'responsible adults bringing children to a community event and nothing more than that'

Concerns were also raised about event 
licences, the lack of stewards, the weight of the fairground roundabout,
notices for road closures, adequate risk assessment and insurance to 
parish council property.

Mr Lightfoot said of the plans: ‘We are concerned as we have dry-stone walls, a fountain and a rockery and an adjacent main road. Our concern is that it is just totally unsafe and unsuitable.

‘As far as I know the Christmas lights committee has not scheduled another place to hold the switch-on.’

The Christmas lights, which cost £3,000 to install and maintain, were due to be lit on November 24 but they are now likely to be switched on without an official event. 

Mr Badham said: ‘If the parish council doesn’t want to co-operate, then we will just turn the lights on without the event.

‘The council is supposed to be 
working with the community, not having all this in-fighting. ‘They have 
also given us nothing in terms of cash.

‘It’s truly a highlight of the year in the village - it’s a delightful event.

‘It’s
all about the community, it’s all about the children and for those 
children who come, it’s absolutely wonderful and marks the start of 
Christmas.’

Health and 
safety guidelines for public events state that organisers need to have 
crowd management, planning for emergencies and event stewards.
