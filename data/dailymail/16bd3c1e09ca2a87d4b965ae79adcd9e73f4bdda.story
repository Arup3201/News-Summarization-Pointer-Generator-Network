Leicester City have opened negotiations with Argentina midfielder Esteban Cambiasso.

The 33-year-old is due to hold talks with manager Nigel Pearson who is keen to assess the player's fitness prior to agreeing terms.

Experienced head: Esteban Cambiasso has racked up almost 500 club appearances during his career 

Attracting interest: Cambiasso is wanted by Leicester, West Ham, Aston Villa and Valencia

Cambiasso is a free agent after leaving Inter Milan and has been in talks with Valencia, West Ham and Aston Villa.

However, he wants a two-year deal which will stretch Leicester's wage budget.

Cambiasso turns 34 later this month and would bring a wealth of experience to the King Power Stadium, with almost 500 senior club appearances and more than 50 caps for his country.

Midfield maestro: Cambiasso scored against Chelsea in a Champions League clash in 2010
