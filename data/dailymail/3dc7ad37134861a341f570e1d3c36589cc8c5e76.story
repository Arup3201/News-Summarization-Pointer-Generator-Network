A 13-year-old boy has been killed after a sacrificial goat jumped off a building and landed on his head.

Turkish schoolboy Heval Yildirim was playing with friends when the goat fell six floors from the apartment block and fell on him. 

The goat had been purchased by his father, Mehmet, in preparation for the Eid-al-Adha festival.

The festival honours the prophet Abraham's willingness to sacrifice his chosen son as an act of submission to God.

Muslims slaughter a sheep or goat in an act of sacrifice to show gratitude for their blessings

The Greater Eid, or Eid-al-Adha, commemorates the willingness of Abraham to sacrifice his son Ishmael as an act of obedience to Allah. 

Eid al-Adha is also known as the Festival of Sacrifice. After witnessing Abraham's devotion and willingness to sacrifice his son, Allah gave him a lamb to sacrifice in the stead of his son, Ishmael. 

Muslims today sacrifice a sheep or a goat, the meat of which is shared among friends, family, and the poor, with each receiving a third. 

In the UK, people also sacrifice animals but are required to make arrangements to ensure it is slaughtered humanely. 

According to the scripture, God intervenes at the last minute to replace Abraham's son with a sheep - an act which forms the basis of its modern celebrations.

In remembrance, Muslim faithful will slaughter a sheep or goat in an act of sacrifice to show gratitude for their blessings.

They then divide the meat into three equal portions - keeping some of it for themselves, giving a third to the poor and giving the final third to relatives, friends and neighbours. 

Mehmet had placed the goat on the roof as the family flat was too cramped.

The animal tried to escape by jumping over a small fence placed round the rooftop and fell on to Heval, who was playing with his friends on the streets below.

He was taken to hospital but was confirmed dead on arrival. The goat also died.  

An investigation has been launched into the incident, with a prosecutor describing it as 'unprecedented.'

His father Mehmet said: 'I am devastated but what more can I say? In fact there is nothing at all to say. 

'Even the prosecutor has said this incident could be the first of its kind around the world.'

The Eid-al-Adha festival is celebrated by all Muslims but it occurs on slightly different days depending on location because it is held according to the Muslim lunar calendar and moon sightings.
