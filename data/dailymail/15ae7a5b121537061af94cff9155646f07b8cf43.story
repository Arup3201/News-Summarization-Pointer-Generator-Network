Ikea is to launch a range of desks, tables and lamps that will wirelessly charge mobile phones.

The Swedish furniture giant revealed today that the new collection will use Qi wireless technology to power-up compatible devices that are placed on or near the furniture.

The Home Spot range of desks, bedside tables and lamps will hit stores in Europe and North America next month - with an international roll-out set to follow.

Jeanette Skjelmose, Ikea’s lighting and wireless charging business area manager, said: ‘Through research and home visits, we know that people hate cable mess.

‘They worry about not finding the charger and running out of power. Our new innovative solutions, which integrate wireless charging into home furnishings, will make life at home simpler.’

Qi is said by its developers to be the most widely-used wireless charging type, and can be used in 3,000 public locations globally. There are now more than 80 Qi-enabled smartphones available.

Among these are models of the Nokia Lumia, Samsung Galaxy, Google Nexus and Sharp Aquos.

Starting out: One technology industry analyst said it was a 'very early time in the furniture business to blend wireless technology' 

Menno Treffers, chairman of the Wireless Power Consortium - which developed Qi - said the new collection shows customers 'the beauty and simplicity of wireless charging'.

The most common type of wireless charging is known as inductive charging, which works on a well-known but rarely-used principle most often seen in electric toothbrushes.

It was discovered by British scientist Michael Faraday in 1831.

Mobile phones are using a more advanced version of the technology, which can operate over centimetres, rather than millimetres.

The docking station has a coil within the charger, which generates an electrical field around the device.

When a suitable mobile phone is placed next to or on top of the station, a coil within the battery resonates with the primary field.

It then takes power from the magnetic field and converts and stores it back as electrical energy.

He added: ‘We applaud Ikea for its unmatched insight and their unique passion for making wireless charging affordable and simple for consumers.’

Two months ago Ikea - which employs 147,000 people worldwide - reported annual profits of €3.3billion (£2.4billion) for 2014, unchanged from the year before.

One of the designers of the Home Spot range, David Wahl, said: ‘We have created smart wireless solutions so you don’t need to see the cables anymore.

‘Many products can be charged at the same time, but you still have a beautiful wireless home.’

Technology industry analyst Jeff Kagan said it was a ‘very early time in the furniture business to blend wireless technology’.

He told Agence France-Presse: ‘I expect every other furniture maker to jump on this same bandwagon.’
