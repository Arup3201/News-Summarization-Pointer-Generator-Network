A 17-year-old boy who is charged with plotting to murder his family and hundreds of students at his Minnesota high school calmly confessed his disturbing plans to detectives and said he thinks he's 'just really mentally ill and no one's noticed.'

Recordings of John LaDue's interviews with Waseca police on the April night he was arrested were released Tuesday, and in them he is heard detailing all the bomb making materials he had collected in the year before he was caught, as he carefully plotted the act which he said was inspired by both Columbine and the Boston bombings.

'My plan was to steal a recycling bin from the school and take on of the pressure cookers I made and put it in the hallway and blow it up during passing period time,' he told the officer slowly.

Then, according to the Star Tribune, he said he'd detonate more explosives when people were fleeing, 'just like the Boston bombings' and finally 'destroy' himself when the SWAT team arrived.

When asked what it was that made him want to kill his family and fellow students, he hesitated before questioning his mental state.

'Hmmm. Well first off, I was not bullied at all. I don't think I've ever been bullied in my life. I have good parents. I live in a good town,' he said.

'I think I’m just really mentally ill and no one's noticed and I've been trying to hide it.'

He later said he hadn't planned on living past the day he carried out the massacre, adding 'I really want to get out of this place,' and then asked to see a psychiatrist.

When the detectives asked if he'd ever seen one before he said he hadn't.

'No one knows what I think,' he said.

On Friday, Waseca County prosecutors also charged a man, Michael S. Jacobs, 40, with selling a .45 caliber Llama handgun to the underage LaDue in summer or early fall of 2013.

Two juveniles, both 17, were each charged with possessing and making explosive devices with LaDue, setting some of the bombs off at a park.

However, the Star Tribune reports that police don't believe the teens knew LaDue's plan to use the devices to kill students.

John LaDue was allegedly planning to kill his family before embarking on a massacre at Waseca High School that involved the same home-made bombs used in the Boston Marathon attack

At a June 18 court appearance, LaDue's
 father, David LaDue, said he believes his son would never have acted on
 his dark thoughts and should therefore not be tried as an adult.

'I
 don't see how he would have ever been able to actually do that, no 
matter how much he would have liked to entertain that idea... because 
it's inhuman,' he said.

At a May court appearance, the teen denied the charges against him. 

He has been charged as a juvenile with 
four counts of attempted murder, two counts of first-degree damage to 
property and six counts of possession of a bomb.

Prosecutors want to charge LaDue as an adult and have until July to make their case.

Dressed in an orange jumpsuit and shackled at the feet and waist, LaDue stared at his father in the gallery on May 12 when he was led in by police officers.

The honors student answered Judge Gerald Wolf's questions in a calm voice, according to the Star Tribune.

If charged as an adult, he could face up to 18 years in prison. However if he is charged as a juvenile, LaDue could be free to leave a detention center when he is 21.

Hi next court appearance is scheduled for July 8. 

LaDue was arrested on April 29 
after a concerned citizen saw him enter a southern Minnesota storage unit.

LaDue admitted 
his intricate plans after being arrested, with police seizing an SKS 
assault rifle with 400 rounds of ammunition, a 9mm handgun with ammo and
 a gun safe with five more firearms, all in his bedroom at the family 
home.

LaDue was allegedly making explosives in a storage unit at this facility in Waseca, Minn., but his plans to use the devices were thwarted when a nearby resident, Chelsie Schellhas, noticed him entering the unit on April 29 and called police

Some of the bombs were allegedly found at this playground as snow melted around Hartley Elementary School playground in Waseca, Minn, in March. John LaDue, 17, has been arrested for plotting to kill his family and massacre students

Also in the room were three completed 
pressure cooker bombs - the same type of explosive used in the Boston 
Marathon attack - while another three - along with chemicals and 
materials to make more - found in the storage facility the teen had 
secretly rented.

LaDue also had 60 pounds of metal ball bearings that would have been placed with the bombs as shrapnel, police said.

The 17-year-old allegedly planned 
to kill his parents and older sister with a .22-caliber rifle, then go 
to the countryside and start a fire to distract police and 
firefighters.

He then allegedly planned to go 
to his school, Waseca Junior/Senior High School, at lunchtime, set off 
explosions in the cafeteria, shoot the school liaison officer and kill 
'as many students as he could'.

The
 plans were outlined in a 180-page diary, which contained one entry 
dated July 2013, giving authorities an idea of how long LaDue had been 
plotting the would-be massacre.

LaDue anticipated he would be killed by a SWAT team, according to charging documents filed in Waseca County District Court.

His father David LaDue earlier revealed that he feels responsible for his son's terrifying plan. He said the main troubling change he noticed about his son in recent
 months was his obscure questioning of a Bible verse, which he had 
interpreted to mean that God was unjust or cruel.

'I
 understand everyone wants to know and try to make sense of it, and it's
 real easy if we could give it a simple answer like "he's a maniac"  
or "his parents just bought him [stuff] and ignored him,"' David LaDue told The Minneapolis Star-Tribune.

'It would really be nice if it was that simple ... I wish it was that simple.'

Mr LaDue also admitted his son, a deer hunter, was allowed to keep some guns in a safe in his bedroom closet, partly because he was trusted to watch out for the family when his father worked overnights in the Twin Cities.

The teen also was allowed to practice throwing Tomahawk knives at an old pine tree in the front yard.

David LaDue also gave his son the OK to walk to a friend's house after the town curfew once, a decision that led to a citation for the boy.

'I tried to indulge him in every way that I thought was harmless,' David LaDue said. 'I feel responsible for everything other than his fantasies or imaginations that I was unaware of.'

David LaDue didn't regularly search his son's bedroom because he felt he had no reason. He had friends, a job at a grocery store, and never messed around with fights, drinking or drugs. 

The 17-year-old is close to his sister, who is just 15 months older, his father said.

'We've never had what I felt was a concrete reason to really be concerned,' David LaDue said. 

Mr LaDue is not sure how his son obtained the storage unit or bomb materials, but said because of his job, he has his own debit card.

Prosecutors say John LaDue used a PayPal account to buy things online.

The father said his son was often the first home in the afternoon and would see the mail before anyone else.

John LaDue had targeted April 20, the anniversary of the 1999 Columbine High School school massacre in Littleton, Colorado, as the date he planned to carry out the attack, authorities said. 

But that fell on Easter Sunday, postponing plans. Authorities believe he was going to act in the next few weeks.

Police allegedly found an arsenal of seven guns, along with bombs and other materials, at this house where John LaDue lived with his family in Waseca. Father David LaDue was allowed to keep hunting guns in his room and throw tomahawks at the tree out front

'I believe there would have always been a reason for him to delay ... until he got caught,' Mr LaDue said.

'I don't know what the proper punishment is for what he's made it look like he was going to do.

'If he actually intended to carry out the things that he says he intended to carry out, I don't see how that's forgivable.'

'(But) I can't believe that he actually intended to do it. I really can't. But I don't expect anyone to believe that.'

John LaDue's capture has been credited to a watchful young woman who lives in an apartment complex next to the storage unit facility the student frequented.

Chelsea Schellhas told The Star Tribune she was doing dishes when she saw the teen was cutting through her backyard.

'He walked through the puddles when there was a perfectly good road he could have walked on,' Schellhas told the paper.

'It just didn’t seem right to me because we see people come and go with their trucks, and they don’t come on foot and cut through people’s back yards.'

'It was like he was blatantly trying not to be seen,' she continued. 'That’s why I thought it was odd.'

LaDue took 'some time' before opening the door, appearing to be breaking in, Schellhas explained.

Able to see into the locker, she noticed shopping bags and trash that 'didn't look right'.

He then closed it behind him, cops said, and Schellhas called 911.

Officers responding to the storage locker around 7.30 pm immediately noticed a significant amount of bombs and bomb making materials, police said. The bombs have since been detonated by an expert team.
