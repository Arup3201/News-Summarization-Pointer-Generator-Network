British war heroes wounded in Afghanistan have been honoured
for their bravery in battle by a tribe of Native American Indians.

A group of injured servicemen - many of whom lost limbs
fighting the Taliban - had their wounds brushed with a sacred healing feather
and were given a 21-gun salute during a unique ceremony at the Grand Canyon.

Elders of the ancient Hualapai tribe in Nevada told the
heroes: 'We are warriors who fought for our freedom. You are warriors
too.'

The group were presented with flags and witnessed a special
tribal dance before posing for photos with their fellow braves on the famous
'Sky Walk' platform, 4000ft above the Colorado River.

Private Alex Stringer, 21, who lost three limbs in an IED
blast in Helmand Province, was among the group, which included guardsmen Colum
McGeown, 28, and Daniel Gill, 24, both of whom lost their lower limbs.

Native American Rudy Clark, who as the grandson of a war
chief has the right to speak for the Hualapai Nation (pronounced Walapai), told
them: 'Like you, we are a proud people.'

The dream trip was organised by Polo For Heroes, a sister
charity of Help For Heroes.

The Britons were mobbed by well-wishers at the
Bellagio Hotel in Las Vegas, where they were joined by former boxing champ
Steve Collins (a charity trustee) at a gala dinner with American war veterans.

Arron Dindyal, 29, formerly of the Royal Anglian
Regiment, says initiatives like Polo For Heroes, which raises funds through polo
events, play a vital role in helping the injured.

Mr Dindyal suffered internal injuries and damage to his spine
during a mortar attack in Basra in 2005.

He said: 'I have lost all of my large intestine, most
of my small intestine and some of the organs around there including part of the
spleen and part of the stomach.

'Before I was injured I boxed in the regiment and went
running for seven or eight miles every day. To go from that to having colostomy
bags and pipes coming out of you - it shatters your confidence.

'It knocked me for six and I ended up splitting from my
wife for about a year because I couldn't deal with my own mental health. Trips
like this one have helped me get a lot off my chest and to speak about the
demons that I hadn't spoken about before.

'Now I am back with my wife and things have never been
as good. We have two children and another one on the way.'

Warriors: The Brits were given a 21-gun salute by their hosts during the unique ceremony

Native American Rudy Clark welcomes the group. He told them: 'We are warriors who fought for our freedom. You are warriors too.'

The group of servicemen, which included veterans from Iraq as
well as Afghanistan, will return to the UK today.

Mr Dindyal added: 'There are guys on this trip who are
missing limbs and they will tell you, "I knew I got hit, but I didn't feel
pain." Your body shuts it off.

'If all hell breaks loose, you know you have got to
finish your job. That is drummed in during training. That's what helps a lot of
military guys survive.'

British Army Captain Andy Haines, the senior UK military
representative on the trip, said: 'It has been an honour and a humbling
experience. The American veterans and the civilian population welcomed us
everywhere we went.

'I can only express how proud I am of all the soldiers,
Royal Marines and Royal Navy personnel. They've suffered extreme pain in their
lives yet they were happy and relaxed.'

Polo For Heroes event director Gary Doggett added: 'These young men are a credit to their country.'
