A toddler with Down syndrome is the adorable new star of Target's latest toy ad. 

Two-year-old Izzy Bradley wears a pink lace dress and leopard tights as she plays with a $49 activity cube in the heartwarming print ad for the retail giant.

Izzy was chosen to model for Target after the company reached out to the Down Syndrome Diagnosis Network in search of models.

Izzy's mom, Heather Bradley, heads the Stillwater, Minneapolis chapter of the DSDN and told CBS Minnesota that she is grateful that Target is raising awareness for the genetic condition.  

'I think it really normalizes Down syndrome and helps people to see we're really just like any other family.'

The proud mom noted that her daughter was a total pro during the shoot, which took place in September. 

'She did really well,' Mrs Bradley said. 'She sat still while they did her hair and make-up. She pretty much cooperated the whole time.'

The 39-year-old said Izzy is enjoying her newfound fame. 

'Whenever she sees the ad, either on television or in print, she smiles, points to herself, and says, "Izzy!"' Mrs Bradley told Yahoo. 

'Her photo is also on the wall of our local Target, so she likes that too.'

She added, 'I want families who are new on a journey with a disabled child to see kids like Izzy and feel hopeful.'

Over the past few years, Target and other mass market retailers have been featuring a diverse array of models, including those with disabilities. 

In a 2012, Target hired Ryan, a blonde-haired, blue-eyed model with Down syndrome, to appear in a clothing ad. The boy, who was six years old at the time, had posed for a Nordstrom campaign before booking the gig. 

The following year, Wet Seal asked 17-year-old Karrie Brown, who also has Down syndrome, to model for them after her mom started a Facebook campaign.
