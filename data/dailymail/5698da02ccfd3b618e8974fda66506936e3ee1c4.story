Lionel Messi scored the winner as Barcelona came back twice against Villarreal to win a five-goal thriller at the Camp Nou on Sunday night.

For a while it looked as if Real Madrid loanee Denis Cheryshev would derail Barca’s pursuit of the league leaders but, with a little help from Neymar - who also scored - and Luis Suarez - who made two of Barcelona’s three goals - Messi ensured the home side took all three points.

Barcelona almost broke the deadlock on 12 minutes when Alves intelligently pulled the ball back for Suarez, who shot first time from the edge of the area only for Sergio Asenjo to fingertip it away for a corner.

Cheryshev was already a threat, beating Alves down the Villarreal left only for Gerard Pique to block his cross. Villarreal were coming into the game on a run of 18 matches unbeaten and looked determined to not lose that record at the Camp Nou.

For Barcelona, midfielder Rafinha - called up for Ivan Rakitic - had started the game brightly and when Victor Ruiz chopped him down Leo Messi had the chance to test Asenjo but his free-kick was headed out for a corner. Messi then so nearly found Andres Iniesta with a cross to the back post that the midfielder just failed to make contact with.

Barca went close again and once more it was Suarez who was denied. Alves’ pass was laid off by Rafinha and the former Liverpool striker’s curling shot went just past Asenjo’s left-hand post. The lively Rafinha continued to pose a threat and, when he was chopped down by Bruno, the midfielder was booked.

Barcleona had only conceded nine goals in the league but on the half-hour mark they let in No 10 and it was the Real Madrid loanee who got it. Cheryshev wants to go back to Madrid at the end of the season and he did his chances no harm diverting Mario’s shot past Claudio Bravo after Mascherano’s poor clearance had run straight to the full back.

Villarreal, who will face Barcelona twice more in the Copa del Rey semi-finals in the coming weeks, increasingly looked to have the measure of their rivals. But just as it looked as if they would make it to half-time in front, Neymar struck with his 21st goal of the season. Messi played in Rafinha whose shot was parried for the Brazilian to convert the rebound.

The tide however had not turned completely and with Villarreal playing the same swift counter-attacking football in the second half they were soon back in front. Pique hadn’t put a foot wrong all night but lost possession to Giovani dos Santos and he crossed for Luciano Vietto to score.

It what was now developing into the one of the games of the season - and Barcelona’s response was almost immediate. Iniesta played Suarez in behind Mario and he crossed for Messi. When the Argentine’s effort was saved Rafinha converted the rebound.

Two minutes later Barcelona were ahead and again Suarez was the provider, nudging the ball to Messi on the edge of the area for Barcelona’s top scorer to sweep the home side into the lead. It was his 342nd goal in his last 342 games for the club.

Villarreal still wouldn’t lie down and Ruiz scrambled the ball in at the back post only for a linesman’s flag to cut short the visitors’ joy. Barcelona then thought they had won a penalty as Asenjo charged into Neymar as the Brazilian was through on goal. Perhaps judging that he had already gone to ground as he lunged to send the ball past the keeper, the referee did not point to the spot and Suarez just failed to head in at the back post as the attack continued with Neymar down.

Now finally in front, Barcelona were not going to let it slip. With Manchester City on the horizon they have found a team spirit that has helped them beat Atletico Madrid twice since the turn of the year and now overcome their toughest test of the season so far at the Nou Camp. And, on top of all that, Messi’s looks back to his imperious best.
