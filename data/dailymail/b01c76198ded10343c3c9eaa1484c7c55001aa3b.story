Buckingham Palace has defended a photo which appeared to show Prince Edward aiming a shotgun over the head of his six-year-old son. 

In the image James, Viscount Severn, appears to be standing a few feet away and in front of his father as he takes aim at a pheasant on the Sandringham Estate.

However the Palace said that the perspective of the photograph makes it look like Viscount Severn was standing almost directly in front of his father as he aimed his gun, when he was actually to his side and perfectly safe.

Buckingham Palace said a photo which appeared to show Prince Edward aiming a shotgun directly over his son's head was misleading and the six-year-old was actually to the side of his father and perfectly safe 

The picture led to criticism being levelled at the Earl of Wessex this weekend as experts warned of the dangers of having children standing in front of someone shooting. Best practice dictates young people on a shooting expedition should stand behind those taking aim.

A spokesman for Buckingham Palace said they always kept to strict safety standards on the estate and that the Prince would never have put his young son in a dangerous position.

He said: 'In the image shown the perspective is very misleading. 

'At no time during the shoot was Viscount Severn directly in front of The Earl of Wessex. As always during any sporting event on the Estate the highest safety standards were adhered to. 

'Any suggestion that The Earl would risk his son's welfare in any way is simply untrue.'

The photo was taken while Edward, the Earl of Wessex, was aiming at a pheasant during a shoot on the Queen’s Sandringham estate in Norfolk on Saturday morning. The Earl and his son are seen looking into the distance before he raises the shotgun.

A witness said he swung his gun from left to right as the bird rose from a maize field.

The British Association for Shooting and Conservation supported the view of the palace and said the photo had made it appear like Viscount Severn was standing directly in front of the gun, when in fact he was more likely to have been to his side. 

They also pointed to the safety precautions taken by the Earl of Wessex in giving his son ear defenders to wear and said they did not believe the 50-year-old would have taken an unsafe shot. 

Mike Yardley, a leading shooting instructor, said children should never be in front of someone shooting. He said sometimes a dog would be in front, but not a person. 

He said: ‘You should never have children in front of you because the problem with children is they run around. It’s not something I would allow.'
