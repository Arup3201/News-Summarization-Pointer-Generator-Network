The number of sick days taken by stressed-out paramedics has soared by 40 per cent in two years.

New figures released by ambulance trusts show they took 43,680 days off because of stress during 2011-12 compared with 31,268 in 2009-10.

The number of ambulance workers suffering from stress has also increased by 42 per cent during the same period, from 728 to 1,035.

Stressing out: New figures released by ambulance trusts show they took 43,680 days off because of stress during 2011-12 compared with 31,268 in 2009-10

Union bosses say the widespread closure of hospital A&Es and rising numbers of 999 calls has taken its toll on ambulance crews, who are breaking down under the stress of the extra workload.

Research by The Mail on Sunday has revealed 33 casualty units across England and Wales have either already closed  or are under threat of being closed or downgraded.

The number of 999 calls has also risen by more than ten per cent in a year for most ambulance trusts across the country.

Adrian Gilbert, Acting General Secretary for the Association of Professional Ambulance Personnel, said: ‘Ambulance staff are run ragged on shifts and it’s no wonder the number of staff off for stress has increased.

‘They are coming in to do  a 12-hour shift and instead it has gone on for 14 hours. You have got hospitals closing A&Es across the country and this means ambulances are having to go farther afield.

‘So instead of a five-mile journey to the nearest hospital, it can sometimes  be a 25-mile journey.

Threat: There are growing concerns that closures and increasing numbers of calls are having an affect on drivers, as research shows that 33 casualty units across England and Wales have either already closed or are under threat

‘If there are three or four vehicles out of the area, it means the ambulance crews who are still in the area are being run ragged.’

The new figures come after a Freedom of Information request to England’s  12 ambulance trusts.

Last week Shadow Health Secretary Andy Burnham revealed ambulances were being forced to wait with patients outside A&E for more than five hours – because of congestion inside.
