Target announced last week that it's ceasing operation in Canada and there's one loyal customer who's been shocked into mourning.

Seven-year-old Reece James Thompson from Nova Scotia was filmed in the car as his parents broke the news.

Video footage shows him suddenly breaking down in tears and petitioning 'I want Target back' - he even asks if they can go and buy something immediately in a bid to improve Target's cash flow.

State of distress: Seven-year-old Reece James Thompson from Nova Scotia was filmed in the car as his parents broke the news that Target in Canada will be closing

The retailer was apparently Reece's one-stop shop for his favorite toys.

'Is there any way we can make [Target] not leave?' the youngster wails.

'I don't know what to tell you, they didn't make enough money,' Reece's father says.

His son then comes up with a cunning plan to save Target.

'Well if we went there right now, we could buy something so they could make money,' Reece says as he continues to cry.

His father says that they can pay a visit to Target tomorrow. 

However, he adds: 'I don't know if I have enough money to save them though.'

Target expanded into Canada two years ago, but has struggled to turn a profit, racking an estimated $2billion in losses.

As a result the Minneapolis-based retailer is shutting its Canadian operation, closing 133 stores and laying off nearly 17,600 employees.

Reece better get stocking up on goods quick. His mother says that Target's exit 'breaks his heart.'

She added: 'His favorite store is closing, and now he thinks he will never be able to get the best Skylanders [toys] ever again! 

'He always had the best luck getting new rare Skylanders at Target Canada.'
