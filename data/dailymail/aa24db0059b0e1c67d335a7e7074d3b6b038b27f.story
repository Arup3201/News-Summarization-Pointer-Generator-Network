A five-year-old California boy is dead after being run over by a bus as he darted across a busy road to meet his mother outside school in front of dozens of horrified witnesses.

Alan Fernandez was trying to cross the street in front of Tuolumne Elementary School, in Modesto, just after class let out Thursday afternoon, police said. The nightmarish incident occurred in front of fellow students and parents at the end of the school day.

He never used a crosswalk, the bus driver never saw him running across the street mid-block, the kindergarten student never had a chance – he was pronounced dead at the scene.

‘He dashed out between two cars right into the bus,’ Nancy Haverly told KMAX. ‘[His mother] was just going spastic, but you can understand it, because she was so upset.’

Haverly added that mortified parents and school administrators were scrambling to shield other young children from seeing the boy’s lifeless body lying bloody in the street.

‘The other kids were coming out. The parents were trying to keep the kids from seeing it, making them look away.’

Parents of students at the school told the Sacramento Bee the street in front of the entrance becomes chaotic in the moments after class lets out.

Vigil: Friends and family gathered Wednesday night to pay respects to the young boy

‘It’s a problem all the time,’ said Carol Arayas, ‘there’s nowhere to pick up the children.’

Gary Haerly ran to do CPR on the boy, but was unable to revive him, he told the paper.

‘It’s asinine for a city bus to go through the school zone,’ he griped, adding that the incident could have been avoided with only a few turns.

‘This street is just always filled with cars, they’re everywhere,’ another parent told the paper.

Modesto schools superintendent Pam Able offered her condolences in a prepared statement.

Memorial: Candles could be seen at the spot the boy was hit by the bus

‘We are heartbroken over this horrific accident,’ she said. ‘Our thoughts and prayers are with the family. Grief counselors are on site and will continue to be on site as long as they are needed.’

The incident had been cleaned up by the time older students were let out at 2.40pm that afternoon – kindergarten is normally only a half-day – and things had already returned to normal, according to the Bee.

School crossing guards were at their normal posts, cars buzzed by and parent’s’ vehicles lined the busy street honking for their children to run through the rain to their rides home.

Friends and family held a vigil Wednesday night and left candles and flowers at the spot the young boy died.
