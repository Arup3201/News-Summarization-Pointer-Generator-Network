An Al Qaeda-trained bomb-maker was last night free to walk Britain’s streets under a cloak of state-sanctioned anonymity.

The fanatic is one of seven men released from Government anti-terror control orders this month under rules meant to protect their human rights.

He undertook terror training in Pakistan and was named as an alleged terrorist by an American supergrass whose evidence helped to foil a massive UK bomb plot. The 41-year-old was part of a London group of Islamist extremists that included one of those who plotted to blow up the Ministry of Sound nightclub and Bluewater shopping centre in 2004.

Security officials say he also had contact with an Al Qaeda leader in Pakistan and helped two of his brothers go to fight in Pakistan, where they died in drone strikes.

Yet despite the dossier of evidence against him, the terror suspect can be identified only as BM.

On order of the courts, the Mail is banned from naming BM or his dead brothers, or from giving his address, until the end of his life.

Ministers say identifying men who have been subject to Terrorism Prevention and Investigation Measures (T-PIMS) would breach their human rights by compromising their privacy or safety.

There is mounting alarm at extremists’ use of anti-terror legislation to hide their identities. Under Home Office legislation, the blanket of secrecy is granted as a matter of course following a simple application by the men’s lawyers. It is lifted only if they go on the run.

MPs called for the ban on naming the suspects to end. Keith Vaz, chairman of the Commons home affairs select committee, said: ‘The lack of monitoring of those originally on T-PIMS should be a real worry to the British public.’ BM, who was born in Britain, was  first put on a control order in 2009 for allegedly being involved in terrorist activity. He was switched to a  T-PIM in 2012 when control orders were abolished.

In 2011, the Court of Appeal heard he was suspected of having explosives training between 2001 and 2004 and being in contact with a senior Al Qaeda leader in Pakistan.

BM was also accused of helping to transfer funds to Pakistan for terrorist purposes and was part of a group in London that was ‘involved in promoting terrorism’.  Also linked to the group was a member of the terror cell arrested under Operation Crevice in 2004 – which foiled a huge plot to use fertiliser bombs to target London’s Ministry of Sound nightclub and Bluewater shopping centre in Kent.

The Ministry of Sound nightclub was also targeted

Five men were jailed in 2007, including Sussex-based Omar Khyam, who was later revealed to have links to Mohammad Sidique Khan, a ringleader in the 7/7 London bombings. A crucial witness in the Crevice trial was Mohammed Junaid Babar, an American who turned supergrass. Following his arrest in 2004, Babar conducted a series of FBI interviews in which he named other alleged extremists, including BM.

In 2011, BM’s brother was killed in a drone strike in Pakistan. A  second brother reportedly died in the same way  a year earlier.

In his review of BM’s T-PIM in 2012, Mr Justice Collins said he was ‘likely to pursue terror-related activity’. Until this month, eight fanatics were subject to T-PIM restrictions on their movements – which can include strict curfews.

But under rules demanded by Nick Clegg, seven of the orders have either already lapsed or will do so by the end of the month.

The newly-free men also include an extremist known as CD who attended a terror training camp in Cumbria with four of the attempted suicide bombers involved in the July 21 2005 attacks.

Last week, Parliament’s joint committee on human rights said it believed T-PIMs – which replaced control orders in 2011 – may be ‘withering on the vine’.

But security minister James Brokenshire said: ‘The police and security service believe T-PIMs have been effective in reducing the national security risk. However, they are just one weapon in the considerable armoury at their disposal.
