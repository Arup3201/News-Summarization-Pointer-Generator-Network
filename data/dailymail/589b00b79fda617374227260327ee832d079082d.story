Headingley and Old Trafford will play host to Ashes Tests in 2019, the England and Wales Cricket Board has announced.

Lord's, The Oval and Edgbaston will host the other three Ashes contests as Trent Bridge and Cardiff both miss out after being named to host matches in 2015.

Taunton has also been handed its first Twenty20 international as part of the ECB's Major Match Awards announcement with England taking on South Africa there in 2017.

Headingley will play host to an Ashes Test in 2019 for the first time in 10 years

Headingley last hosted an Ashes Test in 2009 as England went down to a crushing innings and 80 run defeat while Old Trafford hosted a draw in 2013.

The Yorkshire venue this summer announced the Headingley Masterplan, a 20-year programme of upgrades which will begin with the installation of four floodlight pylons.

Cardiff misses out after being given the honour of hosting the opening Ashes Test in 2009 and 2015 while Trent Bridge misses out on an Ashes contest for the first time since 2009.

Headingley has also been handed a Test in 2017 when the West Indies are the tourists and they will also play matches at Edgbaston and Lord's with one-day internationals at Bristol, Old Trafford, The Oval, The Rose Bowl and Trent Bridge and a T20 international at Chester-le-Street.

Old Trafford is also one of the five venues for the 2019 Ashes series in England

South Africa also visit in 2017 and they will play Tests at Lord's, The Oval, Trent Bridge and Old Trafford with ODIs at Chester-le-Street, Headingley and Lord's.

Taunton will then host international men's cricket for the first time since the 1999 World Cup with Cardiff and the Rose Bowl also hosting T20s.

Pakistan come calling in 2018 with Tests at Headingley and Lord's while India will also play five-day matches at Edgbaston, Lord's, The Oval, the Rose Bowl and Trent Bridge.

Australia will also be the visitors for a T20 at Edgbaston while India face England in the shortest format at Cardiff.
