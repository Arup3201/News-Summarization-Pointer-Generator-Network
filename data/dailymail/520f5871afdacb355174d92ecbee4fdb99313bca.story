Brendan Rodgers has warned his defenders that they must get better if Liverpool are to mount another challenge for the Premier League title this season.

The free-scoring Reds came within two points of winning the championship last season, but conceded 46 goals along the way and the manager has identified his back-line as the main area that needs to be improved.

'(Defence) is a place where we want to be better, there’s no doubt about that,' he told Sky Sports News.

Case for the defence: Brendan Rodgers knows his back-line need to improve this season

Leaky: Liverpool eventually lost the title race to Manchester City after conceding 49 goals

'It wasn’t good enough to concede that many goals, considering the amount of possession we had and amount of goals we scored.

'Generally of course the whole team will be looking to improve, and there are areas that we will specifically be looking at between now and August.'

Liverpool will be tested more this season now that they have qualified for the Champions League, although Rodgers says their return to Europe's elite competition has made signing new players easier.

'We’re in the Champions League, players want to come here and play and that’s great,' he said.

'It is easier to attract players but you’ve still got to do your work and convince players to come.

'The off-season wasn’t much of a holiday really! The scouting team, myself, the directors were flying all over Europe to get players in.'

The Anfield club has confirmed the signings of Emre Can, Lazar Markovic and Southampton pair Adam Lallana and Rickie Lambert - with Rodgers revealing there is likely to be more to come.

'At this level you have to be able to spend and the owners have been great,' he added.

'They’ve 
backed us in terms of getting players in and hopefully we can get one or
 two more in which will give us great depth going into all the 
competitions.'

'The best players want to play at the best level.'

Liverpool
 are expected to complete deals for Southampton defender Dejan Lovren, 
QPR forward Loic Remy and Belgium World Cup star Divock Origi before the
 transfer window closes.

Meanwhile, Rodgers has said that he will not rush the recovery of injured forward Lallana after the England international suffered lateral collateral ligament damage during a training session in the United States.

'Of course it was very disappointing - it's probably going to be four to six weeks,' Rodgers said at a media conference from Soldier Field in Chicago.

'He has looked fantastic in training; it was just a very simple exercise with no pressure. The medical team are looking closely at that at the moment.

'We're hopeful that he'll come back fairly quickly but there's no rush. He's a fantastic player, we just need to get him back fit and well because it's a long season.'
