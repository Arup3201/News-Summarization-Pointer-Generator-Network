The Colombian prostitute at the center of the Secret Service sex scandal, Dania Suarez, could be a future Playmate, according to local media reports.

Miss Suarez, 24, will allegedly 'pose nude in Playboy and give an interview to a reputable journalist recounting everything that happened,' according to The Miami Herald.

She attracted worldwide headlines following an incident at a hotel in  Cartagena when she spent a night with a Secret Service agent who then refused to pay her the agreed price of $800 for her services.

Theresa Hennessey, a spokeswoman for Playboy, said there are 'no plans to post her pictures in the magazine.'

Larry Flynt, publisher of Hustler, revealed he has pictures but has not yet finished writing the article to accompany them.

'There is a public fascination with people in the media and I have little doubt that there is a market somewhere for images like this and a personal revelation of her version of the story,' said Richard Wolf an attorney for the entertainment industry.

It also emerged this week that Colombia’s diplomat in the U.S. has 
demanded that President Obama say sorry for the secret service sex 
scandal  - which he claimed has damaged the reputation of his country.

Gabriel Silva gave an impassioned interview to Colombian newspaper El 
Tiempo where he criticised the American government's handling of the 
scandal which saw federal agents buying hookers.

The embarrassing prostitution scandal has resulted in the Secret Service sending about 100 of its agents on an ethics training course.

The agents will take part in two days of training this week from professors at Johns Hopkins University near Washington.

According to The Huffington Post, the Secret Service has originally scheduled training for just 20 agents.

But following the scandal, it expanded the course to include about 100.

The university has previously worked with the Secret Service and so was deemed a good choice.

The Secret Service has also announced new conduct rules for its agents, including prohibiting them from drinking excessively or bringing foreigners to their hotel rooms.

The incident became public on April 12 when Miss Suarez argued with a Secret Service agent over her payment in a hallway of the 
Caribe Hotel.

Mr Silva was furious that the media storm over the incident has focused 
on the city's sex industry - where prostitution is legal.

Mr Silva told the paper: 'It is necessary, and I want to hear it from the White House.

'A more clear expression of remorse is required to protect the reputation of Cartagena.'

Last week, President Barack Obama described the prostitution scandal as 
'a little distracting' and branded the 12 agents involved 
'knuckleheads'.

Since then, a dozen Secret Service employees, including two supervisors, and 12 military personnel have been implicated.

Eight of the Secret Service officers have been forced out, the agency is
 trying to permanently revoke the security clearance of one, and three 
others have been cleared of serious wrongdoing but will face 
administrative discipline.

They all belonged to the advanced 
security team of President Barack Obama, who visited Cartagena April 
14-15 to participate in the Summit of the Americas.

The scandal has prompted the director
 of the Secret Service, Mark Sullivan, to circulate 'enhanced standards 
of conduct' to his agents.

The document instructs employees to 'consider your conduct through the lens of the past several weeks.'

Highlights of the guidelines included standards of conduct briefings for all protective visits and events.
