The biggest theft in the history of the Cannes Film Festival was 'almost certainly' an inside job, police revealed yesterday.

The news came as detectives confirmed that the hotel safe from which jewellery worth £1 million was taken was not insured.

Officers are also continuing to question an American woman working for Chopard, the Swiss jeweller and festival sponsor, who was keeping the items in her second-floor room at the Cannes Novotel.

She was said to have been enjoying a 
champagne-fuelled night out on the town when a thief tore the small safe
 from a cupboard in the early hours of Friday morning.

A police source said: 'It is very 
suspicious that the thief went straight to the right room, had the time 
to calmly remove the safe, and then make their escape unseen. We are 
almost certainly dealing with an inside job.'

Chopard has 40 staff at Cannes whose 
job it is to persuade stars to wear its products. Julianne Moore, Cindy 
Crawford and Cara Delevingne have been seen wearing Chopard pieces this 
year.

The company has been trying to play 
down the theft, insisting that the jewellery stolen was worth much less 
than £1 million and was not intended to be worn by any stars.

The jewellery had been designed to be
 worn by stars on the red carpet. The theft came as the upmarket resort 
on the French Riviera hosts its annual film festival featuring actors 
including Leonardo DiCaprio and Carey Mulligan.

‘The break-in was at the Novotel in the centre of town,’ said a police source. ‘The room was said to be empty, and the safe was taken off the wall, before being removed.’

Detectives originally estimated loss at ‘around 775 000 euros’, but it was later claimed to be over £1million. The link to some of Hollywood's biggest stars will also add to the value on the black market.

Commandant Bernard Mascarelli, of the Nice police,
confirmed that the entire safe was screwed off the wall and then taken away.

The room is on the second floor – meaning the thieves
would have had to transport the safe out of the building while keeping it
hidden.

CCTV film at the Suite Novotel was tonight being
examined by detectives, who also confirmed that an American woman who is Chopard employee had
been staying in the room. She is being questioned by police.

‘She went out for dinner at around 8pm and didn’t get
back until very late the next morning,’ said another police source.  ‘When she got back, the safe was gone.’

Chopard hands out jewellery to stars for an evening in
an arrangement which allows everyone to gain valuable publicity.

This year there is a Chopard team of no less than 40
people in Cannes whose job it is to persuade the rich and famous to ‘borrow’
their jewellery when they go out on the town.

The jewellery firm is this year promoting a collection
called ‘Red Carpet’, which actresses including Britain’s Emma Watson are
encouraged to wear.Miss Watson is, by coincidence, starring in The Bling Ring.

Chophard has provided the Palme d'Or trophy awarded to
the director of the best feature film for the past 15 years. It features a
24-carat gold palm attached to a piece of cut crystal.

Chopard is one of the official 
sponsors of the 66th annual film festival - it designs the Palme d’Or 
(Gold Palm) award, and creates all the jewellery for the ‘walking up the
 red carpeted steps’ ritual which is broadcast across the world every 
year.

Cannes is notorious for jewellery thefts, with organised gangs frequently targeting boutiques and hotels.

Many turn of the raids turn out to be inside jobs, with staff helping the thieves to locate and then steal items.

Those seen wearing Chopard jewellery at this year’s festival have included Julianne Moore, Cindy Crawford and Cara Delevingne.

Last year, the company’s ambassadors included Eva Herzigova, Jessica Chastain, Reese Witherspoon and Marion Cotillard.

Today detectives were inspecting the second floor room at the Novotel hotel for clues. The Chopard employee, who has not been identified, was also being questioned.

The Novotel Hotel is situated across the road from the municipal police headquarters in Cannes.

In May 2009, a Chopard boutique on the Place Vendome in Paris was raided and more than 6 million pounds worth of jewellery taken.

A man was eventually sentenced to eight years in prison in connection with the crime, but the jewellery was never recovered.
