Floyd Mayweather Jr’s former fiancee has filed a lawsuit against the boxing champion accusing him of beating her and later publicly humiliating her by posting online a sonogram of her pregnancy and claiming they broke up because she got an abortion.

Shantel Jackson said Mayweather also threatened to post naked photos of her on social media if she didn't take down a picture she posted of herself with rapper Nelly at a basketball game in April.

Jackson read a tearful statement in the offices of prominent attorney Gloria Allred in which she said she and Mayweather were together for seven years and that she loved him and thought they would always be a couple.

Adding insult to injury: The 29-year-old said Mayweather publicly humiliated her by posting online her pregnancy sonogram and saying she had aborted their twins

She said she finally left Mayweather after concluding he was abusive and would not change.

Allred did not specify damages in the civil suit against Mayweather, the undefeated boxing superstar whom Forbes described as the highest paid athlete in the world last year, with earnings of $105million.

She declined to say whether Jackson actually got an abortion when pregnant with twins by Mayweather, but said Jackson told Mayweather in January that the pregnancy was terminated.

The lawsuit was filed Thursday in Superior Court in Los Angeles nine days before Mayweather returns to the ring September 13 in Las Vegas in a rematch against Marcos Maidana.

Floyd Mayweather served two months in jail in 2012 after pleading guilty to reduced domestic battery charges stemming from a hair-pulling, arm-twisting attack on his former girlfriend, Josie Harris, while two of their three children watched.

Love story: Jackson and Mayweather met in 2006 when then-21-year-old former model was working as a hostess  

Shantel Jackson, a former model and actress, met Mayweather in 2006 when she worked as a hostess in Atlanta, and they later began dating and were engaged, Gloria Allred told a news conference in Los Angeles.

Jackson stood by him through the domestic violence case and visited him in jail. Then after he was released in August 2012, he physically assaulted her, Allred said.

He allegedly twisted he woman’s arm, choked her and snatched her phone so he could look through its contents.

During the on-again off-again relationship that followed, Mayweather sent a private jet to bring Jackson from Los Angeles, where she lived, to join him in Las Vegas and showered her with Hermes handbags, the attorney said.

The lawsuit alleges that in April 2013, the 37-year-old star athlete assaulted his fiancée once again, 'bent her arm, restrained her, and pointed a gun at her foot asking "Which toe do you want me to shoot?"'

The husband-to-be then allegedly demanded that Jackson take off her 17-carat engagement ring at gunpoint.

At one point, when Jackson was in Los Angeles and refused to move to Las Vegas, Mayweather wrote on Facebook and Instagram that they broke up because she had an abortion and he was ‘totally against killing babies,’ and he posted a sonogram of the twin fetuses he fathered, according to the complaint.

‘I have been embarrassed and humiliated more than I can ever imagine by Floyd, whom I once called my best friend and fiance,’ Jackson tearfuly told reporters.

The lawsuit also accused Mayweather of arranging to have over $1million worth of Jackson's property taken from a storage unit where she put such items as bags and shoes.
