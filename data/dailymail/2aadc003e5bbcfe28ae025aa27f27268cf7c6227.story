Halloween may have been last Friday but Liverpool could be in for another fright night when they take on Real Madrid in the Bernabeu.

The stuttering Reds, who have not looked themselves in either the Premier League or the Champions League this season, will come up against Europe's most feared and in-form forward line in the Spanish capital.

Cristiano Ronaldo, Gareth Bale, James Rodriguez, Karim Benzema, Toni Kroos, Luka Modric - facing Real Madrid is like opening the gates of Hell at the moment and all those torments are expected to feature on Tuesday night.

While Liverpool have won just six matches this season, Real have won their last 11 matches across all competitions, scoring a staggering 46 goals in the process. Liverpool have scored 13 in the same period.

Any illusions Brendan Rodgers had about facing the might of the defending European champions were blown away at Anfield a fortnight ago when rampant Real won 3-0.

Three first-half goals - one from Ronaldo and two from Benzema - exposed the massive gulf in quality between the two sides and that is likely to be repeated in the cauldron of the Bernabeu.

The fact Rodgers is prepared to rest captain Steven Gerrard, who has made 127 European appearances in his career, and make other team changes with one eye on Saturday's visit of Chelsea suggests this is already a damage limitation exercise.

Rodgers, who is coming under heavy criticism for not adequately replacing Luis Suarez over the summer, could also field the likes of Adam Lallana and Lazar Markovic to see if they can handle the big European nights.

Chances are they - and mis-firing forward Mario Balotelli - will see very little of the ball. This will be a back-to-the-wall mission as Real come at them with all guns blazing.

With Dejan Lovren also expected to be rested, 33-year-old Kolo Toure, who has started only League Cup games this season, and Martin Skrtel will attempt to stem the tide.

Ronaldo alone will keep them both occupied. Even by his stratospheric standards, the Portuguese star is having an exceptional season.

He has scored 22 goals in all competitions for Madrid this season. To put that stat into context, the entire Liverpool team has scored just 19.

Cristiano Ronaldo has scored 22 goals in all competitions this season; three more than Liverpool have managed in total.

Indeed, Ronaldo has netted in each of his last 12 games for Real Madrid, scoring 20 in the process (1.7 per game).

Cristiano Ronaldo (70) needs one more goal to equal Raul’s all-time goalscoring record in the Champions League (71 goals).

Karim Benzema has scored in three successive CL appearances (four goals) – he hasn’t scored in four successive CL apps since March 2011.

Benzema (7) has provided more assists than any other Real Madrid player this season (all comps).

James Rodriguez has created 38 goalscoring chances in all competitions for Real Madrid this term, more than any other player.

Real have scored 37 league goals so far in 2014/15; 10 more than any other side competing in the top five European leagues.

Madrid have fired in 84 shots on target in league competition this term, the most of any team in the top five European leagues.

Toni Kroos has made 704 successful passes this season (league only), 117 more than any Liverpool player.

In the Champions League this season, Real Madrid have posted a shot conversion rate of 22.7 per cent (4th best); Liverpool have converted just 6.7 per cent of their shots.

Ronaldo has also scored in his last 12 matches, making him the most in-form striker in world football and surely a shoo-in for the Ballon d'Or in the New Year.

He is never more motivated than when there is a record to break and history could be made on Tuesday night if he scores the two goals required to overtake Raul as the Champions League's all-time top scorer.

The former Real Madrid striker has 71, with Ronaldo just one behind. His great rival - Barcelona's Lionel Messi - is a further goal back on 69.

Although Ronaldo is undoubtedly the scariest, he is merely the first of the demons Liverpool will have to slay in order to emerge with respectibility from this match.

2. Cristiano Ronaldo (Manchester United, Real Madrid) 70

3. Lionel Messi (Barcelona) 69

4. Ruud van Nistelrooy (PSV Eindhoven, Man United, Real Madrid) 56

5. Thierry Henry (Monaco, Arsenal, Barcelona) 50

(excluding qualifying rounds) 

Bale is at Carlo Ancelotti's disposal once again after a gluteus injury but there are suggestions even the world's most expensive player will struggle to get back into the side, such is Real's brilliant recent form.

In his absence they played Liverpool off the park at Anfield, won the first Clasico of the season 3-1 against Barcelona and then thrashed Granada 4-0 on Saturday.

Bale was instrumental in Real's Decima triumph last season but now he's just a nice dilemma for Ancelotti to have with Isco also performing very well.

Rodriguez, meanwhile, has looked better and better with every appearance in the famous white strip and scored a glorious left-foot volley at the weekend, his sixth of the season, that was every bit as good as the one for Colombia against Uruguay at the World Cup that encouraged Real to buy him.

James has also contributed seven assists so far this season, more than anyone else in the Real team.

Toni Kroos has already established himself as the heartbeat in the Real Madrid midfield

Benzema, meanwhile, can't really fail to benefit from such silver service and has nine goals to his credit already this season, while Toni Kroos looks as though he has been running the Real midfield for a decade.

The German has played 704 successful passes this season and his passing accuracy is up at 93 per cent, making his £20m transfer fee look like a bargain.

As if all this wasn't ominous enough, it is 940 days since Real last failed to score in a home match and it is over three-and-a-half years since they last lost a Champions League game at the Bernabeu.

It really is difficult to find convincing reasons to suggest Liverpool can get something here but they did triumph on their last visit - 1-0 back in 2009, with Yossi Benayoun on target.

Perhaps Rodgers can hold on to that as he prepares his team for what could well be a nightmarish evening.
