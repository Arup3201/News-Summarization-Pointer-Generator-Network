Internet users have been accused of cashing in on Channel 4's Benefits Street by flogging branded mugs and t-shirts on eBay. 

The controversial fly-on-the-wall documentary series focusing on the lives of residents living on James Turner Street, in Birmingham has divided the nation since it began on January 6. 

The show has attracted more than four million viewers a week - and now thrifty web users have used the success of the show for their own profit by making a series of Benefits Street branded merchandise.

Internet users have been accused of cashing in on Channel 4's Benefits Street by selling branded mugs and t-shirts on eBay

One would-be entrepreneur is attempting to sell a picture of the real James Turner Street sign on the auction site for £100.

While a T-shirt using the same design but emblazoned with the Only Fools and Horses slogan 'No Income Tax, no VAT' can be bought for £6.99. 

However, one seller's hopes of making a quick profit has not been very successful as the manufacturer of the £7.99 mugs admitted he had sold just one.

Yesterday politicians and local residents criticised those cashing in on the show.

One resident, who did not want to be named, but has lived there her entire life, said: 'It's disgusting they should make money from this. 

'This programme has ruined people's lives, we have been painted with a brush that doesn't represent us and now sick people are trying to make money off our humiliation.'

Birmingham Councillor Chaman Lal added: 'People will stoop to any level to make money, even if it means damaging other people's lives.

'Some people are very inconsiderate and lack compassion for others.

'It's bad enough that the street has been labelled in such a way, but to profit from other people's plights and struggles is just wrong.'

But eBay seller Olly Jones, from Bournemouth-based clothing retailer Elite T-shirts, who sell the garments for £6.99 each claimed the company had no intention to offend.

The show has so far pulled in over four million viewers a week and is set to become the most complained about Channel 4 programme ever made

He said: 'People might say they are offensive, but the other side of the coins is that it's already been done by a documentary team.

'I don't think the shirts will be our proudest masterpiece, but there's worse out there.

'They are more tongue-in-cheek and we are no intending to cause any offence.'

The mugs were created by eBay user 3511Carol, who confirmed he had only made one sale. 

The web user, who wished to remain anonymous, added: 'I made them after I became hooked on the show.

'My missus has been watching the show and suggested I make a mug.

'Sales have not rocketed yet, but I hope they will soon, they have had a few views, but only one sale.'
