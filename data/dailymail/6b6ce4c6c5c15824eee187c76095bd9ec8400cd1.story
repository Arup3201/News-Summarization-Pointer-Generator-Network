Her rags-to-riches story, complete with a handsome prince, could have been taken straight from the pages of Hans Christian Andersen but it seems that Norway's Crown Princess Mette-Marit hasn't lost her taste for doing things the ordinary way.

Faced with a wardrobe packed with old clothes, the 40-year-old chose to dispose of them in the same way as the rest of us - and is currently auctioning them off online.

But there is one royal twist in the tale: Instead of pocketing the proceeds, all of the profit will be turned over to a green charity close to Mette-Marit's heart according to reports in the Telegraph.

Fairytale: Mette-Marit has a rags-to-riches story of her own and was a single mother before her marriage

Among the goods on sale on Bloppis, the Norwegian answer to eBay, are pieces by DKNY, Chloe, Marni and YSL, as well as high street pieces by Reiss and Fillipa K.

Most popular of the items to sell so far was a pair of Dolce & Gabbana boots which cost the buyer 2700 Norwegian Kroner (Â£273).

Unlike the Beckhams, who, after last week's closet clear out, handed their clothes to the Red Cross to sell, Norway's Crown Princess appeared to be doing the job herself and even took the opportunity to reveal why she picked an environmental charity.

Writing on the website, Mette-Marit spoke of the importance of reusing old clothes as she explained her choice of Norwegian charity, Miljoagentene.

'Many of our clothes can be reused rather than discarded,' she wrote, adding: 'Protect the environment in a fun and easy way.'

State visit: Mette-Marit joined Norway's King Harald V and her husband for a visit to the UK in 2005

Popular: Since her 2001 marriage to Crown Prince Haakon, Mette-Marit has become a respected campaigner

The sale is the latest in a long line of charity endeavours undertaken by Mette-Marit since becoming Norway's Crown Princess in 2001.

At the time of her wedding, the princess was the single mother of a four-year-old son named Magnus, but has since had another two children, Princess Ingrid Alexandra and Prince Sverre Magnus with her husband, Crown Prince Haakon, 40.

Although the run-up to the nuptials were marred by revelations concerning Mette-Marit's use of recreational drugs during the 1990s, in the years following the wedding, she has become widely respected for her charity work.

Currently, the princess is a special representative for UNAIDS, a branch of the UN that focuses on dealing with HIV and AIDS.

She also joined the Norwegian aid agency NORAD as an intern, and is a patron of several Norwegian charities, including the Oslo International Church Music Festival and the Norwegian Scouting Association.

Designer treats: Pieces include shoes by Roger Vivier and a Chloe blouse, as well as high street items by Reiss
