A Hull City fan is in hospital after a supporters' bus was attacked near Anfield after the 2-0 defeat by Liverpool on New Year's Day.

A brick was thrown through the window and then Hull fans were set upon after they confronted the alleged aggressors.

Peter Shipp, chairman of the coach firm, East Yorkshire Motor Company, said: 'It was the last coach to leave in the convoy and I think the incidents took place around five or 10 minutes away from Anfield. It must have been some mindless idiots. A brick went through the entrance window and struck the driver. Fortunately, he was not injured.

'Two or three passengers got off the 
coach to confront the aggressors and at least one was hit in the back by
a brick. He is now in hospital. He declined to be taken to hospital at 
the time but is now there this morning. Another was struck in the knee 
and is now on crutches.

'We
think there is around £4,500 worth of damage, whether we will get the 
money back from those kind of people I don't know. The driver managed to
get the coach to the nearest service station and we then had to send 
another coach up from Hull.

'The
supporters did not get home until after midnight. The police were 
called to the incident but nobody was caught at the time.'

Merseyside Police are investigating the incident, which happened in Townsend Avenue, near Anfield, at around 5.35pm.

Officers are now examining CCTV and speaking to the coach company and witnesses from the area to trace those responsible.

Superintendent
Chris Markey, match commander said: 'We work closely with both clubs 
and the local authority at football matches so they can be enjoyed 
safely by all. I'm sure Liverpool residents would agree that it's 
disappointing to hear that visitors to our city have had this 
experience.

'This incident 
will be thoroughly investigated and CCTV from the area is being sought. I
would ask anyone who witnessed this incident, or who has any 
information to contact 101 or Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 
111.'
