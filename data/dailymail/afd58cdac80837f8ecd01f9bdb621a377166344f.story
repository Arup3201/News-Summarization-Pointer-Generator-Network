Scheme: The father of Vania Ferrara (pictured) who appeared on Italian talent show 'Leaving You a Song,' is accused of forcing hundreds of people to vote for his daughter

A mafia boss tried to ensure his daughter did well in a TV talent show by forcing his entire community to vote for her.

Domenico Ferrara handed out mobile phones to neighbours and relatives in the district of Villaricca  in Naples so that they could cast multiple votes for 13-year-old Vania.

He made sure the phones were returned so he could check his orders had been carried out, Italian police said yesterday.

But the votes of the terrified community were only enough to propel  Vania to second place in the final  of Rai 1’s I’ll Leave You With A Song.

Details of the fix emerged as police arrested Ferrara and eight of his clan on suspicion of drug trafficking.

A raid on his house uncovered 320 mobile phones. Police chief Captain Francesco Piroddi said: ‘The Ferrara clan exercised complete control over the district of Villaricca.

‘This number of phones cannot be explained by the fact that Ferrara did not want to have his calls intercepted, nor that they were for use by his gang members.’

I'll Leave You with a Song features a large group of children contestants who are 
selected from among the leading students of Italy's most prestigious 
music schools.

They are assigned songs to perform in groups or solo, and may also 
perform with the show's guests. with the accompaniment of a 30-piece 
orchestra.

The
format for the contest involves viewers voting for their favourite 
songs. The singer who receives the most votes wins that week’s programme
and goes through
to the final.

Accused: Domenico Ferrara is led out of his home by Italian police following his arrest

Contestant: Ms Ferrara came second on the popular TV show when she appeared last year

Nine members of the Ferrara clan, 
part of the Naples mafia – which is  also known as the Camorra – were 
this week arrested for links to drug trafficking, with Domenico said to 
be the kingpin.

Mr
Ferrara, an alleged drug-smuggler, is accused of being head of the 
Ferrara-Cacciapuoti Camorra clan, an organised crime group, in the 
province of Villaricca near 
Naples.

The Camorra is believed to be Italy's bloodiest organised crime syndicate and is allegedly responsible for hundreds of killings.

Ferrara was arrested this week on suspicion of mafia association and being involved in shipping drugs from Spain to Italy.

He is nicknamed in Neapolitan dialect O’ Muccuso (the Snotty One) and Zi’ Mimmi (Uncle Mimmi).

This isn’t the first time the mafia have moved in on the world of showbusiness.

In 2010 another Italian talent show – 
Songs and Hopes – was condemned after a contestant, the daughter of a 
different Camorra boss dedicated to her father the song ‘You are the 
best daddy in the world and I wouldn’t change you for anything’.

At the end of the live broadcast Mary 
Marino was seen embracing her father Gaetano who was sitting in the 
front row. He was later gunned down in a classic gangland hit in the 
resort of Terracina.
