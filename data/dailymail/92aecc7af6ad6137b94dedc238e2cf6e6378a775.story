Human body parts found 30 miles apart in two waste water plants in Southern California has been identified.

Erin Lynn Cruz, 27, went missing three days before legs, feet and pelvis were found at a pollution control plant in Carson, California, on October 26.

The Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department said yesterday it is still treating Ms Cruz's death as homicide.

Police have identified the body parts that were found at sewer plants, including this at Industry, California, as belonging to missing Erin Lynn Cruz, 27, from East San Gabriel Valley

The lower half of Ms Cruz's body was found at this plant in Carson three days after she was last seen

Authorities are still trying to establish a cause of death and think she was already dead when she was placed in the water system.

They believe her body was dumped in the sewer system through a manhole.

It was then broken apart by the pumps in the system.

Two
days after the first grim discovery, workers investigating a clog at a 
sewage treatment plant in Industry California, found a head and torso in
a holding tank.

The remaining body parts have now all been recovered.

Sheriff's
Department Lieutenant Mike Rosson told NBC Los Angeles: 'That body at 
some point was placed in the sewer system when it went to the water 
treatment plant in the Bassett area.

Investigators believe that her body was dumped in one piece but broke apart and distributed to two plants

'The body suffered a mechanized separation.'

No arrests have been made so far.

Ms Cruz, from East San Gabriel Valley, was last seen in the La Puente area on October 23.

She did not have a permanent address but stayed with friends and family.

The sewage systems in the San Gabriel Valley connects the plants in Carson and Industry - despite their being 30 miles apart.Â 

There was no contamination to the drinking water supply.

Instead, the sewer plants treat the water and expel it into the Pacific Ocean.
