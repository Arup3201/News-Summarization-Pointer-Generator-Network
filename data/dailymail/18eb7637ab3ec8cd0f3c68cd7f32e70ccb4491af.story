Kenny McDowall cited 18 years in the Old Firm goldfish bowl as his reason for quitting Rangers.

A former Celtic development coach, McDowall moved to Ibrox as first-team coach when Walter Smith returned as manager in 2007.

Assistant to Ally McCoist for four years he was thrust into the spotlight as caretaker manager when McCoist was placed on gardening leave.

Uncomfortable in the role, McDowall compounded the storm clouds over Ibrox when he resigned on Wednesday after just three games in charge.

The interim boss will remain in the technical area as he serves 12 months’ notice, but admitted he needs a break from the chaos of recent times.

‘To be quite frank, the last four years have been tough,’ said McDowall, explaining his shock decision for the first time. ‘That aside, I have been nearly 18 years at the Old Firm and it takes its toll.

‘I just told the club I’m happy to honour my contract for the next 12 months and then step aside. I’m not complaining because you can’t be involved in clubs like these and not have stress – it’s all part and parcel of the job.

‘It was a really tough decision. I made it last Wednesday and the club received a letter on the Thursday.

‘In terms of making the decision, after having discussions with my family I felt it was the right thing to do at this point in my career.

‘I have had fantastic times but I just feel I will do my 12 months then step aside, take a break and see where it takes me. I expect to be here for the next 12 months unless I’m told otherwise.’

Wary of the impact his decision would have on his stuttering side’s promotion bid, McDowall asked for the news to be kept in-house.

Disappointed it then leaked, he admitted: ‘I tendered my resignation on the Thursday after deciding the day before I was going to do it.

‘But it came out on TV, so the players saw it before I could get to them. I just had to tell them and ask that they keep working hard. Was I surprised when it came out? Yeah. I was working my notice so (it was supposed it to remain in-house) for 12 months.’

He had pondered his options for some time.

‘When Ally was put on gardening leave and I was appointed as caretaker manager I was happy to do so. Assistant managers do it all the time.

‘Once the dust settled a wee bit and I had time to think it through this is what I have come up with. It’s maybe time I had a break.’

Notice periods in football rarely work, as even Walter Smith and Gordon Strachan can testify, with many professional footballers subconsciously compelled to down tools the moment their gaffer calls it quits.

Publicly, McDowall and his players — as they must — will make the right noises.

Yet the truth is this. If an already stuttering promotion campaign suffered further water damage in Cowdenbeath on Saturday, no one would be remotely surprised. Neither can anyone offer cast-iron assurances that a team which has lost two managers in a month will be ‘at it’ against Celtic in the League Cup semi final at Hampden next weekend.

Asked if those in his charge are up for the task right now, McDowall replied: ‘I absolutely hope so, but can I guarantee it? I have said to the boys they have my respect and I expect it back.

‘They have worked very well this week and we look forward to the league game at Cowdenbeath.

‘I can only ask them to keep at it. I pick the team and once they go out on the park, you need them to play, whether it’s Rangers, St Mirren or Liverpool. They are paid to play and you hope they would want to do it for themselves as much as anything.’

In mitigation, the Rangers players can plead a level of disruption which, even by Scottish football standards, is unparalleled.

McDowall has urged them to draw on the levels of professionalism which took them to the club in the first place. However, asked if there was a legitimate worry they may ‘chuck it’ and begin to think of their own future first and foremost, McDowall nodded: ‘I wouldn’t disagree with you. When the news came out, I had to get the boys in the next morning and explain my situation.

‘A lot of them are out of contract in the summer, too, so all I could do was be as honest as I can over why I did it. I told them they have to play for themselves and look after their own futures.’

What comes now for McDowall is far from clear. Cast into a hot seat he looked uncomfortable with from the start, he may have expected the Rangers board to follow the path adopted for McCoist and place him on gardening leave. McDowall, you sense, could live with it if they did.

‘I was surprised to be appointed,’ he conceded. ‘I can’t say I expected it. I’m not going to say I had my boots all polished and I was ready to step in.

‘Of course, it was a big task but I was probably as experienced as anybody out there, given what I have learned over my career.

‘But absolutely, it’s a daunting task. You have to get on with it. It’s a great opportunity and a massive honour for me to be the caretaker manager for the team I supported as a boy.

‘Never in a million years would I have thought I’d be leading the team out on a Saturday and that’s why it was such a difficult decision to resign.

McDowall said he expects to serve his 12 months notice, unless the board tell him otherwise 

‘Who wouldn’t want to manage a club of this size? I am not any different from anyone else, but unfortunately the circumstances are what they are. I’ve made my decision for myself and my family and that’s where I am at the moment.’

In the statement confirming his departure, the board suggested he would carry on for the next 12 months with ‘normal duties’.

‘I’m still trying to think what is normal at the moment,’ he grinned. ‘This job is totally different from when I came here eight years ago.

‘The staff has been diluted from when Walter brought me as his first-team coach and Ally was assistant.

‘I’m sure I’ll sit down with a glass of wine some night and say: “Wow”. I’ll think: “That was an incredible journey.”

‘But I’m still in it and I’m focused on winning the game at Cowdenbeath, and we need to try to peg Hearts back. If we can’t do that, then it’s the play-offs. But we need to try to get promotion and get the club back to where it should be.’

Meanwhile, McDowall declined to comment on the SFA charging goalkeeper Steve Simonsen over breaches of gambling rules after he was alleged to have bet on 55 matches, although none involving Rangers. ‘The club issued a statement and I can’t comment any further until after the hearing,’ he said.’
