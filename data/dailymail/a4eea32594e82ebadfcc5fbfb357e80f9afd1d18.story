Trinity College's May Ball is one of the biggest events of the year at the elite university, and, for some students, it's also the perfect excuse to invite their favourite popstar to visit.

The #TaylorAtTrinity campaign, spearheaded by undergraduate Harriet Gordon, consists of a playful recreation of Taylor Swift's hugely successful single 'Shake It Off' - filmed at some of the most iconic spots on campus.

Aside from the video, students have also launched a widespread social media campaign across Facebook, Twitter and Instagram, in hopes of getting Taylor's attention.

Cambridge students have launched a #TaylorAtTrinity campaign, complete with 'Shake It Off' music video

Taylor Swift's 'Shake It Off' music video, uploaded on August 18, has received over 240 million views

'The idea started when a group of us were listening to her new album in the library,' Harriet told the MailOnline in an email.

'We absolutely loved it and couldn't concentrate on our work, so we decided to send her a photo with an 'I love 1989' sign, as she often replies to fans.

'It kind of snowballed from there.

'Everyone was in a bit of a slump - halfway through term tends to do that - so I thought it would be great to do something different and fun.'

The #TaylorAtTrinity video, conceptualised by ndergraduate Harriet Gordon, has almost 10,000 views

The idea to record a music video first started while listening to Taylor Swift's new album in the school library

The filming of the video itself was completed in just two and a half days, though Harriet admits that it was 'quite tricky organising everyone in between lectures.'

The picturesque Trinity College provided the perfect backdrop for the brilliant video, which wound up involving about 60 students from start to finish.

'It's such a beautiful place to live and none of us want to take it for granted, so it was a great opportunity to show our pride for the place,' the second-year Human, Social and Political Sciences student added.

'Shake It Off' has been certified 2x platinum in the United States and certified gold in the United Kingdom

'We want her to appreciate how many dedicated fans she has here,' Harriet says

Though the ultimate goal is for the pop superstar to perform at the college's May Ball, Harriet insists that she'd be happy simply to learn that Taylor had seen the video.

'We want to her appreciate how many dedicated fans she has here who wanted to do something special for her,' she said.  

A sought-after student event, the first official First and Third Trinity May Ball was held in 1866 and has evolved significantly in the last 148 years.

This year's May Ball will be held on June 15, 2015 - and as of right now, it does look like Taylor just might be available.

She’s scheduled for a performance on June 13 in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania and her next 1989 World Tour date isn’t until June 20 in Cologne, Germany.

Perhaps she'd fancy a day off in the English countryside?
