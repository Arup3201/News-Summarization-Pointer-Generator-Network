Tourists have been evacuated from one of the most iconic bridges in Paris after it began to crumble under the weight of thousands of 'love locks'.

A chunk of the Pont des Arts bridge fell away on Sunday night and the police were called to seal off the area which remains closed today.

It is a popular custom for tourists to secure a padlock to the bridge branded with their names as a romantic gesture, with Kourtney Kardashian and boyfriend Scott Disick also indulging in the tradition.

Dangerous: Police said it was lucky the rail collapsed inwards rather than out into the river below, which is often busy with tourist boats

Kim Kardashian has also been pictured attaching a lock to the bridge when she visited Paris while pregnant.

But the weight of the locks is damaging 
the metal Ponts des Arts, which was originally completed in 1804 but rebuilt in 
the 1980s following damage in the two World Wars.

A local French police spokesperson said: 'A metal grille had fallen inwards, rather than into the river.

'If it had landed on a passing boat, the results could have been disastrous. As it happened, nobody was injured.

'The bridge was evacuated, and will now be closed until Monday morning at the earliest.'

In the family: Kim Kardashian and her mother Kris Jenner also stopped at Pont des Arts on a visit to Paris to attach a padlock to the bridge

Vying for space: There are now so many padlocks on the bridge that some tourists have taken to attaching theirs to lampposts too

If follows growing calls for the padlocks - which also blight other major European cities including London - to be banned.

It has become common practice for visitors to buy a padlock, attach it to a bridge, and then throw the key into the river, in Paris's case the Seine.

The practice has been encouraged by American celebrities including Kim Kardashian and Kanye West, who spent a lot of time dating in Paris before their wedding in Italy last month.

The famous Paris bridge is said to offer some of the best views along the Seine

It was first built between 1802 and 1804, under the reign of Napoleon, and is a favourite with artists

Due to damage sustained in WW1 and WW2, the bridge was rebuilt between 1981 and 1984

The 'love lock' tradition began in Hungary in the early 20th century, based on a tale of a woman who lost her soldier love to another during WW1. Young women started symbolising their love by attaching padlocks to the bridge where the abandoned woman used to meet her lost lover.

The padlock tradition took hold in Western Europe in the early 2000s and was popularised by an Italian book I Want You by Federico Moccia, in which a couple adds a padlock to the Ponte Milvio in Rome.

In Paris, the ritual began in 2008 on the Pont des Arts but has since extended to the Pont de l’Archevêché near Notre Dame too.

Othe bridges encountering problems from a vast quantity of padlocks being affixed are the Ponte Vecchio in Florence and the Ponte l’Accademia in Venice.

A
 'Not Love Locks' campaign was launched in Paris by two Americans in 
February, in response to some 700,000 padlocks appearing around the 
city.

All
 bridges have been blighted by the practice, but the Pont des Arts now 
looks like two solid walls of metal divided by a wooden walkway.

'It's so out of control,' says Lisa Anselmo, who co-founded the campaign with fellow writer Lisa Taylor Huff.

'People
 are climbing up lampposts to clip locks on, hanging over the bridge to 
put them on the other side of the rail, risking their lives to attach 
one. It's a kind of mania. It's not about romance any more - it's just 
about saying 'I did it.'

Protests: A campaign has been started to stop the practice of fixing locks to the bridge - a problem that blights iconic bridges across Europe

Anne 
Hidalgo, the Socialist mayor of Paris, has so far resisted calls to take
 action over the vandalism, but the bridge collapse could change that.

A
 spokesman for the City Hall said: 'If the tradition continues to grow 
in popularity and causes too much damage to the city's monuments, 
solutions will be considered in a bid to address the problem.'

The pedestrian Pont des Arts, which 
links the Louvre Museum and the Institut de France, is an exact replica 
of one designed by Napoleon Bonaparte's architects in 1802.

Lookout point: The bridge is famed for its spectacular views along the Seine

The original was damaged by German bombs during both world wars, but a faithful reproduction was built during the 1980s.

It was once considered a hugely romantic bridge, enjoying arguably the prettiest views in the city, but many locals argue the padlocks have turned it into a tourist trap.
