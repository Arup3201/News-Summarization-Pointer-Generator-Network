Controversial District of Columbia Councilman Marion Barry has sparked outrage for disparaging remarks about Asian-owned businesses in his poor, majority-black ward.

Following his decisive election to Ward 8 on Tuesday, Barry declared at the victory party, 'We got to do something about these Asians coming in and opening up businesses and dirty shops. ... They ought to go. I'm going to say that right now. But we need African-American businesspeople to be able to take their places, too.'

Causing an avalanche of criticism to come his way, Barry, 76, drew ire from across the political spectrum in Washington D.C following the remarks which were picked up by WRC-TV.

Controversial Ward 8 D.C. Councilman Marion Barry said Thursday that he was not trying to insult the city's Asian community

'It’s regrettably inappropriate. I’m hoping he misspoke,' said Susan Au Allen, the president of the U.S. Pan Asian American Chamber of Commerce, who admitted that Barry’s comments had concerned her.

'We should be keeping our focus on how to make life better for everybody.'

Barry's fellow D.C. Council members did not line up to support him either.

'I strongly disagree with the recent remarks made about Asian American business owners in the District,' said council Chairman Kwame Brown in a news release.

'Statements like that are divisive, destructive, and have absolutely no place in our city.'

However, following the mountain of concern aimed at Tuesday's statement Barry apologised for his comments today.

'I want to express my deep apology for offending some members of the Asian community and the D.C. community,' Barry said in an interview with The Associated Press. 'I have a solid record of relationships with the Asian community.'

The former mayor won the Democratic primary for his Ward 8 council seat with 73 percent of the vote, all but assuring him of another four-year term.

Mayor Vincent Gray, Council Chairman Kwame Brown and some of Barry's council colleagues criticized the longtime D.C. politician on Thursday.

A group of Asian-American lawmakers in Maryland also condemned Barry's remarks.

'I am deeply disappointed by Council-member Barry's comment,' Gray said in a statement. 'There is no room in this wonderfully diverse city for comments that disparage anyone on the basis of race, ethnicity, gender, religion, disability or sexual orientation.'

Serving four terms as mayor of the District of Columbia in Washington, Marion Barry was the first notable member of the civil rights movement to be elected to become the chief executive of an American city

Barry served consecutive terms as mayor from 1979 to 1991 and again from 1995 to 1999

In January of 1990 Barry was videotaped smoking crack cocaine and arrested by FBI officials on drug charges

He served six months in prison from October 1991 to April 1992

In March 2006 he was sentenced to three years probation for failing to pay federal and local taxes and failed a drugs test for which he underwent drug counseling.

The Washington Post has claimed that 'To understand the District of Columbia, one must understand Marion Barry'

Delegate Eleanor Holmes Norton, who represents the district in Congress, said she was 'stunned by the offensive nature of the comments.' Norton called Barry and reminded him of the values they shared while working together in the civil rights movement, she said, adding that she was pleased that he would apologise.

Barry, 76, served four terms as mayor, a tenure interrupted by his six-month term in federal prison on a drug charge.

Since his return to the council in 2004, he has developed a reputation for racially charged statements.

During
a recent radio appearance, he said he didn't like the architectural 
firm recommended to build a new public high school because it was 
'all-white.'

And with 
Gray and Brown under federal investigation for possible campaign 
misdeeds, he has suggested that black politicians are more heavily 
scrutinised than their white counterparts.

Washington has long been a majority-black city, but the white and Asian populations are growing.

African-Americans made up just 50 
percent of the district's population during the 2010 Census. The city is
34.8 percent white and 3.5 percent Asian.

The four time mayor of Washington D.C later apologised for any offence to the Asian community caused by his comments

Tensions have long simmered between blacks and Asian merchants in many urban communities.

Korean
shopkeepers were subject to violence during the 1992 riots in Los 
Angeles that followed the police beating of motorist Rodney King.

Barry told AP that he was wrong to single out Asians but said he was referring to merchants who don't sell healthy food and don't engage with the community or hire local residents.

'We need businesspeople who'll be a part of the community, not exploit the community, give jobs to those of us in the community, and to contribute to the well-being of our community, have fresh vegetables and fruits and et cetera,' Barry said.

Barry, however, did not back away from his claim that some Asian-owned convenience stores and carryout restaurants don't 'respect' the residents in his ward.

'Ward 8 residents are spending their hard-earned dollars in these stores because they are the only stores in the immediate neighborhoods; my constituents want respect, too,' he said in a statement. 'It is to these less-than-stellar Asian-American businessmen in Ward 8 that my remarks were directed.'

Furthermore the former mayor claimed took to Twitter to claim that his comments were misconstrued.

'I'm very sorry for offending the Asian American community. Although 
taken out of context by many about the conditions of some W8 carryouts,' said Barry on Twitter.

'The comment was meant to convey that some stores need better service to 
and engagement with the community than what is provided now.'

Barry noted that during his time as mayor, he created the city's Office of Asian-Pacific Islander Affairs and established a sister-city relationship with Beijing.

Soohyun 'Julie' Koo, the director of that office, said she was glad that Barry had apologized.

'Marion Barry has been very supportive of our community, so I was very surprised by his statement,' she said.
