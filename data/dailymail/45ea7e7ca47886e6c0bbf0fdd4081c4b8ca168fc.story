Muslim snooker player Rory McLeod has explained the reasoning behind the 'ISIS' badge he was spotted wearing against Ronnie O'Sullivan in the Welsh Open.

McLeod, the only British Muslim on the snooker circuit, caused a stir on social media with his waistcoast badge bearing the initials 'ISIS' in his match against O'Sullivan on Monday.

But he has since explained that the badge bore the logo of ISIS Business Solutions - his personal sponsors of the last 14 years - rather than of an Islamic terror organisation.

But the 'ISIS' refereed to by the badge is ISIS Business Solutions, not the terrorist organisation.

Some viewers watching on the BBC were confused by the badge with some drawing unlikely links to the terrorist group.

McLeod, 43, lost his second-round match against O'Sullivan 4-2 at the Motorpoint Arena in Cardiff, having beaten Andrew Pagett by the same score in the first round.

The competition concludes on Sunday.

Spectators watching on the BBC were a little confused by what McLeod's badge was referring to
