Residents of Berlin are up in arms at new plans to demolish part of the city's famous wall in order to build luxury flats.

The proposal to obliterate a key monument from Germany's history and replace it with accommodation to the super-rich has met with widespread outrage.

However, the mayor of the district where the demolition is planned insists that it is necessary to connect the east and west sides of Berlin better.

For the three decades that it cut the city in half, the Berlin Wall was a global symbol of oppression and the divide between the communist and capitalist halves of the world.

But since the city was united in November 1989, what remains of the wall is considered to be an important monument to Germany's torrid history.

In addition, the 0.8-mile of wall known as the 'East Side Gallery' is thought to attract as many as 1,000 visitors per day.

The wall is covered in vivid graffiti, much of which was painted by some of the world's leading street artists.

However, part of the wall is set to be torn down to give access to 'Living Levels', a 200ft skyscraper being built on a strip of land between the wall and the Spree river, according to The Local.

The tower will be divided into 36 luxury flats which are set to sell for up €7,000 per square metre (£560 per square foot).

Franz Schulz, mayor of the 
Friedrichshain district, told Die Welt that part of the wall would have 
to be demolished to connect his area with the neighbourhood of 
Kreuzberg.

Location: The proposed site of the flats is in the heart of the German capital by the Spree river

A new bridge, the 'Brommybrücke', will span the Spree and provide a further link between the two formerly divided parts of Berlin - but can only be built if a section of the East Side Gallery is removed.

Locals have circulated a number of petitions protesting against the planned demolition, arguing that it would transform the historic and public nature of the area.

Nearby nightclubs, representing the traditional Bohemian lifestyle enjoyed by West Berliners during the Cold War, have also joined the protests against further development.
