Lucy Britner, 30, pictured, was the only one who could see the two men and sprang down from the stage, shouting: 'What are you doing?'

A classical singer stopped in the middle of her recital to run down a church aisle to stop thieves raiding a charity collection.

Lucy Britner, 30, was the only one who could see the two men and sprang down from the stage, shouting: 'What are you doing?'

The audience turned in their seats in surprise as she confronted the men at the back of the packed church.

One was holding £150 in donations which had been left in a bowl but she wrestled back the money.

Members of the 70-strong audience at the Unitarian Church in Brighton, including an off-duty police officer, chased after the men but they fled.

Then Miss Britner, a food and drink writer, resumed her show Centuries Of Song in aid of The National Brain Appeal.

She said: 'At first I thought they were interested in the singing.

'But then I saw them looking at the money and one of them tried to conceal the other while he perched next to the bowl and grabbed some cash.

'Frustratingly, I was the only one facing that direction so I just had to run out and stop them.

'It was unnerving but I had spent months practising those songs and there was no way I wasn't going to carry on.'

Miss Britner's fiance Luke Ellis, 30, who accompanied her onstage for one song, was in the vestry arranging some flowers when he heard the commotion.

He said: 'I didn't know what the heck was going on.

'I had an image in my mind of someone jumping up and down in the audience and then saw what had happened.

'Everyone was just bewildered.'

Mr Ellis, whose parents Vic Ellis and Margaret Grimsdell also played, said: 'She took it in her stride, even after physically restraining one of them.'

The show ended on a high note, with more than £300 collected for The National Brain Appeal.

Miss Britner performed her show, Centuries Of Song, in memory of her friend Alan Lodge, who died aged 29 from a brain haemorrhage.
