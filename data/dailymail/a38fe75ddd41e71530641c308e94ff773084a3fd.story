Undercover: Frenando Jara spent five years under the guise of a radical Muslim after the 9/11 attacks

It may sound far-fetched, but a California man says he lived a real life spy thriller when he became an unlikely secret agent.

Fernando Jara, of Kern County, spent five years completely off the grid beginning in 2001 when the seemingly normal guy joined the ranks of America's most clandestine agency.

It was shortly after the September 11 attacks when Jara, who had recently converted to Islam, sent an email to the CIA, offering his services as a spy.

To his surprise, the feds got back to him, and offered him the job, Jara told the Los Angeles Times.

He had dropped out of high school, and at the time was working toward his equivalency degree at community college.

Jara quickly got to work, traveling within California and to Virginia and Washington, DC, where he received training in Arabic, counter-terror tactics and weapons.

He was also connected with David Manning of Ventura, California, who taught the then-26-year-old how to handle knives and guns.

Manning told the LA Times: 'They said he was under the radar and getting ready to go to Afghanistan to infiltrate the Taliban. I told them, "I'm not doing this." I didn't believe them.'

Jara credits Manning with turning him into 'a one-man army.'

The next five years of Jara's life have remained a pretty guarded secret, but he tells the LA Times that he infiltrated numerous terror training camps in Yemen and Afghanistan while posing as a radical Muslim.

The paper reached out to the FBI and CIA for comment on Jara, but both agencies declined to comment.

After several years in the spy game, 
Jara's cover was exposed in a Yemen bar when a fellow patron said that 
he was either a combatant or a foreign intelligence official.

After that incident, Jara was ordered to escape Yemen.

Upon his return to the U.S., things began to go downhill for Jara, who had developed signs of post-traumatic stress disorder and alcoholism.

But thanks to the kindness of Cal State Professor Mark Baker, who took in a distraught Jara after finding out he had been living in his car.

From there, things began to improve for him.

In 2011, Jara married Leticia Perez, a public defender who now serves as Kern County supervisor, the first Latina to hold the post.

Today, Jara, who runs the RockHill Farm - a rehabilitation clinic for drug and gang crime offenders - suffers from PTSD and often struggles with some of the violent memories.

He told the Times: 'I'm ashamed of some of the things that happened over there. I don't hurt people anymore. My soul couldn't take it.'
