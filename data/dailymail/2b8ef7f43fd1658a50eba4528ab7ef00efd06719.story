Passengers are now being bussed back to their destination more than an hour away.

Izzy Ferris, 19, who was on board the flight, said: ‘We were just flying over Barcelona and this storm came out of nowhere.

‘We were hit by lightning, it was absolutely terrifying. There was a massive loud bang and a lot of flashing.

‘Everyone is fine but a lot of the women were screaming and crying and the cabin crew were flung down the plane.

‘I think one guy even saw the lightning go all the way around the plane.

‘We had to make an emergency landing because of it all, they're putting us all on buses to go back to Barcelona.’

Diverted: The easyJet flight was rerouted to Spain's Reus Airport due to storms

The flight, from Bristol Airport, was due to arrive at Barcelona International at 10.10am local time.

But, just minutes before landing, the plane was struck by the freak storm.

It is thought the airport is currently closed, with many other planes also forced to land at Reus.

Other passengers took to Twitter to speak of their horror.

Darren Williams, a web development student at Newport University, said: ‘Just flew through a monster storm, plane hit by lightning and we were diverted to Reus Airport.

‘Worst flight I've ever been on... Currently sat on the plane waiting to see what's happening next.’

While John Evans wrote: ‘Holy sh*t the plane got struck by lightning, and we had to land in a different airport.'

A spokesman for easyJet said the plane had been diverted due to storms and had been struck by lightning on its descent.

They added: 'easyJet can confirm that flight EZY6025 carrying 154 passengers from Bristol to Barcelona airport was diverted to Reus airport due to thunder storms at Barcelona. 

'The safety and welfare of our passengers and crew is always easyJet’s highest priority and the aircraft landed safely at Reus at 10:30am local time.

'The aircraft is equipped to safely withstand lightning and at no point was the safety of the flight, passengers or crew on board compromised.

'Passengers disembarked as normal and will continue their onward journey to Barcelona by road.  We apologise for any inconvenience experienced.

'A full inspection of the aircraft will be carried out in due course.'
