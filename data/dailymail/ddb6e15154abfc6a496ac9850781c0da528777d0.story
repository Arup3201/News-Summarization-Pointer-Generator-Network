A distraught mother is living in fear after she found the cross from her 10-year-old daughter's grave buried upside down in her garden and 'RIP' sprayed across her bedroom window.

Florica Tiru, 45, said she is too frightened to go outside following the attacks at her home in Willesborough, Ashford.

The cross was on the grave of her daughter Ana-Maria who had cerebral palsy and died in July 2010 aged 10. 

Miss Tiru said only a handful of people knew the location of the grave which made her even more fearful.

Florica Tiru said she is too scared to leave her house after her bedroom window was smashed and 'RIP' sprayed on to it 

The mother-of-two also discovered her 10-year-old daughter's grave buried upside down in her garden

The mother-of-two, who came to England from Romania in 2008, said: 'What hurts me the most is that someone took my daughter's cross from her grave and brought it here.

'Only a few people know where my daughter's grave is. I'm so angry and hurt. I want to put the cross back but I'm scared it will be taken again or go missing.

'I feel like I am just waiting for the next thing to happen. I'm scared for my life, scared they will hurt me. I haven't left the house since all this started.'

She added: 'It has been very hard since Ana-Maria died. I can't sleep very well.' 

Miss Tiru is currently being cared for by her neighbours as she is too petrified to leave her house

In a second attack, while Miss Tiru was in her living room, a brick was thrown through her bedroom window

The first attack took place last Thursday. Miss Tiru had been in Ashford town until about 3pm and then returned home.

At 7pm, a neighbour knocked on her door and asked if she had seen what was outside.

She discovered the cross, which had been taken from her daughter's grave, as well as the chilling graffiti sprayed on the window. Her daughter was buried at St Mary the Virgin Church in  Willesborough.

Then, on Wednesday night, Miss Tiru, who was in her living room, was woken when a brick came through the same window that had been sprayed, landing on her bed. 

Eggs were also thrown at her kitchen window.  

Miss Tiru, who has two children aged 25 and 27 living in London, is currently being cared for by her neighbours.

Jeanette Law, 48, said: 'Since Wednesday I have been with her from 8am till midnight every day.

'I stayed the night Wednesday because she was so scared. She hasn't slept in her room since it all started, she's too scared.'  

Police are investigating reports of an ongoing dispute between neighbours around her home. 

A spokesman for Kent police said: 'We are aware of all the incidents and are following all reasonable lines of inquiry.

'Anyone with information about who is responsible is asked to contact Kent Police on 101 or contacting Kent Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111.'
