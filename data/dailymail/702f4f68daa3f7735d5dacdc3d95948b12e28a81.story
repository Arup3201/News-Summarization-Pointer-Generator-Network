Inter Milan are plotting a summer move for Fernando Torres and have the funds to pay the £20million fee Chelsea will demand for the striker who holds the British transfer record.

Torres has just over two years left on the £150,000-a-week deal he signed three years ago when he arrived from Liverpool for £50m and has been left in no doubt that Jose Mourinho will prioritise a big-money replacement.

Misfit: Chelsea are ready to cut their losses on striker Fernando Torres

Mourinho was caught on camera less than two weeks in a private conversation with the boss of a Swiss watch company complaining that his team did not have a striker as it challenged for the Barclays Premier League title.

Atletico Madrid's Diego Costa, Monaco's Radamel Falcao and AC Milan's Mario Balotelli are among his targets but Chelsea must recoup much of their spending to keep within UEFA's Financial Fair Play restrictions.

Torres is one who will command a decent fee, even if his value has plummeted during three inconsistent years at Stamford Bridge.

Inter's new owner, Indonesian 
businessman Erick Thohir insists he will not waste millions on 
rebuilding the team but he backed manager Walter Mazzarri in January by 
funding a £17m swoop for Hernanes.

Representatives from the Italian club were in dialogue with Chelsea 
during the January transfer window, asking about Juan Mata and offering 
Fredy Guarin in return. No deals were struck but contact was 
strengthened and the Italians could return for Torres.

The move for Torres follows Inter announcing the capture of Manchester United captain Nemanja Vidic for next season.

Sportsmail
 revealed how Inter had been first to react to the veteran Manchester 
United defender’s decision to quit Old Trafford at the end of the 
season.

The club confirmed they had finally 
got their man on Wednesday and a picture of Vidic was posted on Inter's 
official Twitter feed along with a welcome message for the United star 
that read: 'Here's Vidic signing his contract. See you in June, 
Nemanja!'

An agreement has been reached on a 
lucrative three-season deal that will send Vidic into 
retirement on a high, in terms of status and earnings, at another of 
Europe's most famous clubs.

On his way: Vidic will join Inter after his contract runs out at Manchester United

The
32-year-old's contract that will be portrayed as being for two years, 
with an option for a third, but is effectively for three seasons. He 
needs to make a certain number of appearances for the third year to kick
in, but it is believed to be so low – barely double figures each season
– that it should be a formality.

With
the Serbia centre back out of contract in the summer and a free agent, 
he has been able to secure a salary of £3m a year after stoppages, 
despite his best years being behind him. 

It is the equivalent of around £6m 
each season, before tax and other deductions, and means he will have 
earned close on £20m by the time he finishes his San Siro contract
and, in all probability, calls time on his career at the top.
