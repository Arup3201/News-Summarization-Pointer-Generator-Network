For those living in Tornado Alley - or planning a camping trip during extreme weather conditions - some good news may be on the horizon.

A Missouri-based inventor has just come up with a relatively inexpensive way to stay safe during a twister: an over sized sleeping bag made from the same material as bulletproof vests.

The Tuuli Armor Tornado Shield is extremely versatile and can be stored anywhere, weighing only 12 pounds when all rolled up.

Useful for camping during British summer time? The  bag claims to withstand tornadoes  -  and even bullets

It expands to the size of a queen-sized bed in less than a minute and is large enough to accommodate two adults and a child inside.

While the sleeping bag won't protect you from injuries from larger materials (like broken bones), it can resist being punctured by flying debris up to 200 miles per hour, which can be just as dangerous.

Cuts and lacerations make up over 90 per cent of injuries caused by tornadoes.

Protection from flying debris comes from layers of padding and ballistic nylon

Protection comes from layers of padding and ballistic nylon, and the bag's bottom layer is made of ripstop nylon so you can breathe while you’re inside. 

The inventor, Steven Anderson, came up with the idea in 2011, after two massive tornadoes ripped through his home town of Joplin in the Spring.

'Our family didn't have any protection, we didn't have a safe room to go to. So after that tornado, I started looking for options to protect my family. My wife and our four-year-old son.'

'But there weren't any options that were less than $4,000, so I started developing a product that would bridge that gap between nothing and $4,000.'

At just £247 - or £197 for early adopters - it's a much more affordable option than safe rooms or storm cellars.

The Indiegogo campaign is looking to raise £65,000 to put the Tornado Shield into production.

Currently, developers have raised just over £1870 of their goal.
