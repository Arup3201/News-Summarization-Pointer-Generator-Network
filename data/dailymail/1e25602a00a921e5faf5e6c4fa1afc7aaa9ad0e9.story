Home Secretary Theresa May delivered a major speech which ranged far beyond her law and order brief, setting out how the Tories can win the next election

The Conservative party must shake off its reputation for being on the side 'just of those who have already made it', Theresa May warned today amid warnings just seven per cent of Tories think David Cameron can win the next election outright.

In a highly unusual speech ranging far beyond her law and order brief, the Home Secretary insisted the party could secure victory but only if it becomes 'the home of those who want to work hard and get on in life'.

The major address at a conference organised by party activists comes amid growing speculation that Mrs May has her sights set on becoming Tory leader if Mr Cameron fails to win an overall majority.

It is likely to cement her reputation as a possible leader in waiting, and will delight Tory backbenchers who want the party to reconnect with blue-collar workers.

Damning polling released to coincide with today's conference showed that three-quarters of Tory supporters think Labour’s Ed Miliband will be the next Prime Minister.

In the comprehensive speech covering trade, banking, industrial 
strategy, welfare, prisons, trade unions, education and training, car 
manufacturing and the NHS, Mrs May repeatedly stressed Mr Cameron was the right leader for the party and had what it takes to be Premier.

But she stressed that the Conservatives needed to give people a voice, and offer them security from crime, foreign threats and everyday risks like losing their job or illness.

'We have a good record and we have the right team.  But those advantages alone will not be enough,' she told the ConservativeHome Victory 2015 conference in central London.

'We have to become the party that is tireless in confronting vested interests, the party that takes power from the elites and gives it to the people, the party not just of those who have already made it, but the home of those who want to work hard and get on in life.'

The comments will be seen as an attempt to help the Tories shed the image of being party of the elite, with opponents focussing on the privileged backgrounds of Mr Cameron and George Osborne.

Mrs May added: 'We need to offer them security, not 
just from crime and foreign threats, but from everyday risks like 
falling ill, or losing your job.

'We
need to promise them freedom, not just from the state but from vested 
interests like unions, big bureaucracy and, yes, big business.

'And we need to give them opportunity, by reforming capitalism and making sure our economy works for all of us.'

Mrs May said the Tory party could be an 'unstoppable force' but only if if occupies the common ground, is tough on crime and immigration and reforms public service reforms and the economy.

'By standing up for the people, by taking on anybody who gets in the way, by confronting vested interests wherever we find them, we will change the country for the better.  And we will win the next general election.'

The number of Tory members who think David Cameron win a majority in 2015 has slumped from 23 last March to just seven per cent now

Hopes of a Tory, or even playing a part in government, seem to be fading, according to a survey of more than 1,800 Tory members by ConservativeHome

Mr Cameron is under increasing pressure to reassure the party that he has a plan to win the next election, after failing to defeat the scandal-hit Lib Dems in Eastleigh.

With the party still reeling from being 
beaten by the UK Independence Party in Eastleigh, Tory planning minister
Nick Boles, an arch-moderniser, said he had been ‘thoroughly p***** 
off’ by the ‘truly rotten campaign’.

Tory rebels claim his leadership could be pushed into crisis within weeks if the Budget fails to deliver and the party suffers a drubbing in May’s local elections.

Amid rumours of Cabinet ministers jostling for position, as MPs consider life after Mr Cameron, Tories said they were braced for the loss of hundreds of seats in the May polls.

Several Tory MPs have put the Prime Minister and Chancellor George Osborne on notice that this month’s Budget must prove to be a ‘game-changer’ which tackles the rising cost of living and gets the economy moving.

But with barely two years until the general election, it seems many Tory activists have given up hope of victory.

Since March the proportion of Tory members who think the party can win an outright majority in 2015 has collapsed from 23 per cent to just seven per cent.

According to a survey of 1,844 Tory party members for grassroots website ConservativeHome, almost a third (31 per cent) think Labour will win an outright majority, nine per cent believe Mr Miliband will form a minority Labour government and a further 34 per cent expect a Labour coalition with the Lib Dems.

Eight per cent predict a new coalition between the Tories and Lib Dems, while the remaining 11 per cent expect Mr Cameron to fall short of a majority but will lead a Tory minority government.

Two thirds (62 per cent) think the hardest task facing the party is stemming the loss of support to the UK Independence Party while 29 per cent believe trying to defeat sitting Lib Dem MPs to be the toughest challenge.

Tim Montgomerie, editor of ConservativeHome, said: 'Tory members are NOT saying that exposing Labour is a less important task than stopping defections to UKIP.

Planning minister Nick Boles said he was 'thoroughly p***** off' by the party's campaign in Eastleigh

'My hunch is that they are answering the specific question.

'They worry that while the British people may be very open to believing that Ed Miliband isn't the right choice for these tough economic times they are worried that a large number of normally Tory-minded voters are going to choose UKIP over the Conservatives and it's going to be difficult to win them back.

'A 6 per cent to 7 oer cent showing for UKIP at the next general election won't produce a single MP for Nigel Farage but it may be enough to prevent Cameron from winning an overall majority.

'Key to Tory thinking is that if the election is framed as a straight Cameron versus Miliband choice then many UKIP voters will prefer the Conservatives to Labour.'

The rise of UKIP has spooked Tory strategists, who are planning to launch a detailed attack on the anti-EU party’s policies in the coming weeks.

However Mr Boles, who was a key advisor to Mr Cameron during the early days of his leadership, warned against a lurch to the right.

In a frank assessment of the party’s ability to win back voters, Mr Boles said the Tories failed to offer voters any hope in Eastleigh and repeated the same mistakes it has been making for more than a decade.

Mr Boles told The Times last week's Hampshire by-election had been a ‘truly rotten campaign’.

The planning minister said: ‘Where was the hope? It was as if modernisation had never happened.

‘We screwed it up. We didn't even screw up in a new way. We screwed it up in an old way that we have been doing for a decade. It's so frustrating.’

But Mr Boles, an ally of the Prime Minister's, warned plotters they needed ‘their head seeing to’ if they believed it was wise to attempt to oust Mr Cameron.

A separate poll by former Tory donor, Lord Ashcroft, suggests the Tories would lose 93 seats to Labour in an election tomorrow.

The survey of more than 19,000 voters in 213 constituencies suggests a swing from the Tories to Labour of around 8 per cent in the most marginal Conservative seats.

It predicts the Lib Dems would lose 17 seats to the Tories in England and Wales and 13 seats to Labour.

Launching the poll at the Conservative Home 'Victory 2015' conference in London, Lord Ashcroft said: ‘I don't want to see a Labour majority of 4, let alone 84. But I hope this puts the challenge into some sort of perspective.

‘We have a long way to go to hold onto the seats we gained last time, let alone pick up many more. But things are slightly less grim than the headline polls suggest, and we have everything to play for.’
