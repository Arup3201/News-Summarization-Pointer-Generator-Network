An unidentified man claiming to be a Member of Congress was allowed backstage with President Barack Obama at event last Saturday night, according to an overnight news report.

The impostor assumed the identify of New Jersey Congressman Donald Payne, Jr. to get close to Obama, Bloomberg News reports, during the Congressional Black Caucus Foundation's annual conference and awards dinner in Washington, D.C., last weekend.

The incident is the third time in recent days that someone who should not have had access to the president was allowed to be in the same vicinity. The astonishing set of blunders has led to calls for a top-to-bottom review of the Secret Service, even after the resignation of the agency's director earlier this week.

The two other known security breaches occurred on September 16 and 19, respectively. The first lapse involved a man armed with a gun being allowed to ride an elevator with the president during his visit to a Centers for Disease Control and Prevention facility in Atlanta, Georgia.

The agents guarding Obama did not know the man, who is allegedly a convicted criminal, was carrying a weapon, until after he was confronted by security officials for acting unprofessionally in the president's presence.

The other episode took place at the White House several days later. In that instance, a man with a knife jumped the fence that protects the president's home and evaded security guards inside and outside the White House before being tackled by an off-duty Secret Service agent near the East Room of the building.

At last Saturday's event, the man posing as Congressman Payne was able to get backstage by following real Members of Congress through security. He then joined a line of lawmakers waiting to have their photos taken with the president.

The man was not caught until a White House staffer realized he was not the New Jersey congressman, a White House official told Bloomberg.

Although the man should not have been allowed anywhere near Obama, a spokesman for the Secret Service assured Bloomberg that he had no weapons on him at the time.

'This guy went through security, fully screened,' agency spokesman Brian Leary said.

After the man was identified as an impostor, Bloomberg says he was simply asked to leave. No charges were filed nor was he detained.

Bloomberg said its source in the White House and another administration official it spoke to were not able to say just how close the fake congressman was able to get to the president and the first lady, who was also at the Sept. 27 event. But he was in the same area as them, which is a strict no-no.

The disturbing security lapse follows a report from Inside Sources that a Secret Service agent assigned to guarding the president dished about his campaign schedule to a staffer on Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney's campaign in 2012 in order to woo her.

The site, ran by a former Romney staffer, also alleges that the agent gave 'joy rides in a Secret Service vehicle with the lights flashing,' according to two other former Romney staffers with knowledge of the incident. 

On Friday House Oversight and Government Reform Committee Chairman Darrell Issa, a Republican, and the committee's ranking member, Democratic Rep. Elijah Cummings put their partisan differences aside to pen a joint letter to the Secret Service's parent agency, the Department of Homeland Security, demanding that Secretary Jeh Johnson authorize an external review of the security hub as a result of September's security breaches.

'The panel should review not only recent security lapses, but the full range of management, personnel, training, and cultural issues that contribute to the root causes of these security failures,' the duo wrote.

The White House acknowledged Wednesday afternoon that DHS would be conducting an internal investigation into those matters over the next few weeks. The report will then be reviewed by an independent counsel of outside experts tasked with making a set of recommendations to the agency,

The panel will also have the opportunity to suggest replacements for former Secret Service Director Julia Pierson, who resigned on Wednesday under pressure from Congress.

Former Secret Service agent Joe Clancy is taking a leave of absence from his job in the private sector to manage the important government agency until a permanent replacement for Pierson can be named to the position.
