A 2-year-old boy was found alone in a room in a filthy house full of garbage without access to food or water, police said.

A family member contacted authorities in Cumming, Georgia, after the boy’s mother, 21-year-old Stephanie Davis, had been arrested on DUI charges.

Several deputies found the boy crying loudly in a locked room, covered in excrement, and severely hungry and dehydrated.

Squalor: Stephanie Davis, 21, was arrested on DUI charges; authorities found her 2-year-old son locked in a room without food or water

Davis had apparently called the family 
member around 4.40a.m. last Friday after her arrest to let them know that 
her son was unattended.

When deputies arrived at Davis’ house, they found a dog barking and running around the exterior of the property. The residence itself was locked.

According to the Alpharetta Patch, officers from the Forsyth County Sheriff’s Department could also hear the cries of the baby boy.

In a news release, Sheriff Ted Paxton said: ‘Because of the extenuating circumstances, one of the deputies pulled the screen off of the window and entered the home.’

He said that the deputy then went through the window and into the room where he hear the child’s cries. ‘What he found was a child that was trapped in his room by a closed door, equipped with a safety device on the inside doorknob that prevented the child from opening the door.’

The sheriff’s report then describes in graphic detail the sordid conditions in which the boy was living, according to the Atlanta Journal-Constitution.

Fighting spirit: Police said clothes and old food was strewn about Davis' house

‘The child was dressed in a dirty white (T-shirt). He had removed his diaper himself and it was on the floor, filled to overflowing with feces. The child had feces on his hands, feet, and legs,’ Mr Paxton said.

Mr Paxton said that the deputies’ first course of action was cleaning the waste off of the crying child and putting a clean diaper on him.

But the sheriff noted that because of the general squalor of the home, it was impossible to find clean clothes for the boy.

One deputy took it upon himself to retrieve clothes and food from his own home to give to the child, while others went to find clean water for him to drink.

Living in filth: Deputies said there were around 50 bags of garbage on Davis' porch, and the house was in a state of disarray

It is unclear how long the boy was alone and without food or drink, Patch reported. According to the release, the room in which the boy was found had only a mattress and box springs in it. Other rooms were in equal states of disarray.

'I commend the deputies for their response and for the caring actions at the scene. This is a situation that could have ended quite differently.'

-Sheriff Ted Paxton

Officers described a pungent odour of urine, rotting food, and feces coming from the house.

In their search of the home – which was full of garbage and clothing strewn about the home – they found two dogs, one of which had been barking outside of the house.

The other dog was found locked inside a cage. Both were given water and taken to Animal Control.

On the porch, there were more than 50 bags full to bursting with garbage, and inside, there was clothing strewn about on the floor of the residence.

Deputies also found used razors and towels littering the home, and broken window panes. 

Davis was charged with cruelty to children in the second degree, as well as reckless conduct.

Sheriff Paxton said he was thankful that his deputies found the child when they did. ‘I commend the deputies for their response and for the caring actions at the scene,’ he said in the release.

‘This is a situation that could have ended quite differently.’
