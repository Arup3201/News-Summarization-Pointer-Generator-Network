This is the shocking moment a thug punched his partner 15 times ‘like a human punchbag’ in front of her three young children in a busy shopping centre lift.

Jason Edwards, 36, cornered his partner in the lift at Westfield Shopping Centre in Shepherd’s Bush, west London, before launching an assault on her.

The attack, which lasted around two minutes, took place in front of the victim’s three children, who are all under the age of 13.

Jason Edwards, 36, cornered his partner in the elevator at Westfield Shopping Centre in Shepherd’s Bush, west London, before launching an assault on her. He punched her 15 times in front of her three children

Edwards punched his partner, who has not been named, as if she was a 'human punchbag'. The victim did not seek treatment for her injuries but Edwards was tracked down by police and arrested after fleeing the scene

When the lift doors opened, Edwards was greeted by a security guard but managed to flee the scene before police arrived.

The victim, who has not been named but is from north west London, did not attend hospital following the attack and refused to press charges or inform the police of her partner’s identity.

However, an investigation was launched by detectives at the Community Safety Unit in Hammersmith and Fulham and Edwards was tracked down days later on February 16.

He admitted assault occasioning actual bodily harm at magistrates’ court the following day and has now been jailed for two years at Isleworth Crown Court, Greater London.

Following his sentencing, detective sergeant Damian Ash, of the Metropolitan Police, said: ‘Shockingly, Edward’s attack has been compared to a boxer relentlessly cornering and punching his opponent on the ropes.

The attack, which lasted two minutes, took place in front of the victim’s three children, who are all under 13

‘For nearly two minutes he struck his partner as if she was a human punch bag in front of her three children who were helpless to stop it.

‘Despite reluctance from the victim in revealing the identity of her partner and attacker, we were able to progress the investigation quickly using the CCTV and intelligence available to us’

He added: ‘This case is testimony to our commitment in bringing violent offenders to justice, whatever the circumstances are, even when there is no victim statement provided at court.’
