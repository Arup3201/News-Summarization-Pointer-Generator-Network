A five-year-old kidney patient from Australia has recorded a heartwarming message of support for a British boy seeking a donor.

Seven-year-old Matthew Pietrzyk, from Glenfield, Leicestershire, was born with a rare genetic disorder that has damaged his kidneys.

Last week, in a bid to find a living kidney donor and to raise awareness of organ donation, his mother Nicola uploaded a picture of Matthew to Facebook, appealing for a million people to 'like' the image.

Now Matthew and his family have received a touching video message from a five-year-old named Jack Scoble, who lives on the Gold Coast in Queensland, Australia, and underwent a kidney transplant himself last year.

The video, which has already been watched by more than 1,000 times, was posted on the appeal's Facebook page by Jack's parents.

In the video, Jack says: 'My mum and dad have told me that you were waiting to find your new kidney. I want to tell you to hang in there buddy.

'I got my new kidney after a whole year and, even though I am little, I remember how hard it was living on the machine and having injections every day until my new kidney came.

'But keep your fight and your chin up, Matthew.'

The big-hearted youngster also encourages people thinking about liver donation to come forward.

'To everybody that's thinking to be a donor, don't be afraid to go mate, my donor wasn't and gave me a chance to live and grow up with mum and dad and brothers and sisters,' says Jack.

'I will never forget how brave my donor was and thank God and heaven for him everyday.

'Thinking of you Matthew and tell your mum and dad not to cry.'

In a post under the video, Jack's dad, Darryl Scoble, said his family send their love and support, and added: 'Our family is here for your family.'

Mrs Pietrzyk, 33, an aerobics teacher, said the message had helped give her family hope, she said: 'It just overwhelmed me and was so heartwarming,' she said.

'Credit to him and his parents that they have taken the time to do something so nice.

'Jack might be only five, but he summed it all up perfectly, what it is like to have to go through what he went through, and what it is like for Matthew.

'Matthew really liked it and because Jack is littler than him he thought he was cute, and his message was very sweet."

Matthew's aunts, uncles, grandparents and family friends have been tested as potential donors, but while six share his blood group, none were a sufficient match.

The youngster was born with congenital nephrotic syndrome which means his faulty kidneys get rid of protein through his urine

He had one kidney removed in October 2007 to prepare him to receive a donor organ from his mum.

The transplant took place in January, 2008, at Nottingham City Hospital but the new kidney failed immediately and was removed.

He had both his kidneys removed and, while he waits for a donor to be found, has to endure daily dialysis sessions.

Matthew is on the national waiting list, alongside hundreds of other children.

His family and friends have been tested as potential donors, but while six share his blood group, none were a suitable match.

It was when Mrs Pietrzyk's youngest brother was found to not be a match that she launched her online campaign last month.

The first picture of Matthew posted by his mother attracted 700,000 likes. She has now posted a new picture which shows Matthew holding a sign saying 'Share Your Spare', which has attracted thousands more.

To support Matthew online, or find out how you can help, visit Facebook and search for 'A million likes for a kidney for Matthew'.

Mrs Pietrzyk said: 'You can live on dialysis for about 25 years, but I don't want Matthew to spend his childhood on dialysis.

'Even if we don't get a donor for Matthew through this, just getting the word out there about how people can be a live kidney donor would be brilliant - you don't have to die to be a donor and some people don't know that.'
