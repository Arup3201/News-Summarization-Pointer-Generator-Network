A navy lieutenant has escaped a jail sentence after he secretly filmed a female friend taking a shower in Sydney.

Abraham Duncan, 24, was handed a 12-month suspended sentence for filming the covert footage on January 22.

He had previously pleaded guilty to a charge of filming a person in a private act without their consent to obtain sexual arousal and returned to Downing Centre Local Court for sentencing on Wednesday.

Duncan set up a hidden camera in his bathroom while he was living in Sydney's King Street, according to court documents.

The footage he filmed of his unassuming friend taking a shower was later found on his computer by another friend.

They showed it to her and she went to police, leading to Duncan's arrest.
