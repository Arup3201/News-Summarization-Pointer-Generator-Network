It really does pay to go to church.

After a Chicago parish was bought out of a multi-income residential development it helped fund in the 1970s, it came into some money - to the tune of $1.6 million.

And in deciding what to do with the unexpected fortune, pastor Laura Truax, of LaSalle Street Church in Gold Coast, decided to donate 10 percent of it to her own congregants.

All 300 of them.

Overjoyed: Pastor Laura Truax of Chicago's LaSelle Street Church decided to divide up $160,000 her church received in a real estate among her 300 congregants

Donations: The church thus wrote out 300 personal checks for $500 each and gave them out at a service of September 7

Generous: In the 1970s, LaSelle Street Church (pictured) helped fund a multi-income housing development, which was sold in June for $50 million. The church received a stake of $1.6 million

In dividing up the $160,000 evenly, Truax worked out it was easiest to give each of her loyal regulars $500, and set about writing personal checks.

'In that moment, I was worried this is stupid, this is silly,' Truax told WGNTV.

'People will think I'm squandering $160,000.

'And I didn't want to be known as the person who squandered $160,000 and so I was nervous about that.

'But I felt like this was the place of faith.'

'It felt right.'

So on September Pastor Laura, as she is known, announced to the church that it was actually them who would receive a donation.

'Some started to cry,' she said.

'Their mouths started to drop. I started to sweat because it sounded so crazy.'

Pastor Laura told her congregants to do whatever they believed was right in the money, be that investment, helping others or helping themselves.

Members started a board at the non-denomination church where they could right down some ideas on how best to use the $500.

In shock: Members of the church could not believe it when they were told they would be receiving the money

Ideas: A message board has been set up at the church where members can write days way in which they can use the money to help people

There is still $1.4 million that the church itself will donate or invest.

However pastor Laura said she really hopes her decision will inspire other churches.

'My real hope is that other churches will hear about this and they're going will swallow and they're going to jump.

'Find some way in them that we found and that they're going to jump with their people.'

LaSalle Street Church owned a 15 percent stake in Atrium Village, a 309-unit residential development in nearby Near North Side.

According to DNA Info, British Columbia-based company Omni Group acquired the site in June as part of a $50 million buyout.

The church came out with $1.6 million.
