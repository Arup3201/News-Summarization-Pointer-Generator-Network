A time-lapse video recording melting glaciers in Montana received an unexpected endorsement from one of the park's residents - when a furry marmot photobombed the camera.

Greenpeace environmentalists left a GoPro camera in Glacier National Park in the US to raise awareness of global warming which is melting glaciers in the area.

The video shows the curious critter scurrying towards the camera before giving it a good lick before dashing off.

Grass warrior: Marmot emerges from the vegetation and scurries over to the Greenpeace camera which was set up in Glacier National Park in Montana, US, to record the effects of climate change

Activists had hoped to show how the alpine tundra - land where there is no vegetation because the ground is always frozen - is shrinking as more and more trees grow higher up the mountain.

But instead, the marmot, who lives in the tundra, took actions into his own hands in a bid to protect his home. 

A Greenpeace spokesperson said: 'Though we didn’t capture the time-lapse video of Glacier National Park that we intended to, we captured something much cooler ... Marmot Love.

'This Marmot would like to give you a kiss for helping to save its home.'

The video is part of the Greenpeace campaign 'Keep our coal in the ground' which brings attention to the fact that the agency charged to protect national parks  - the Department of the Interior - is auctioning off land for coal mining.

Greenpeace has also launched a thermal airship at Glacier National Park to highlight with large banners reading 'Coal exports fuel climate change.'

It flew over Decker Coal Mine in Montana where work is expanding at a rapid rate, prompting another two environmental groups to file a lawsuit in a bid to halt plans.

Northern Plains Resource Council and the Western Organization of Resource Councils hope to block more mining.

Greenpeace is calling on the government to consider the environment as they back the coal industry's export ambitions and stop selling off land for mining.

'Climate change is a major threat to national parks like Glacier, and more coal will only make it worse whether it is burned in Montana or Beijing,' said Greenpeace energy campaign director Kelly Mitchell.

'If interior secretary Sally Jewell is serious about protecting our national parks from the impacts of climate change, she should establish a moratorium on new coal leases and pursue comprehensive reform of the federal coal leasing program.'
