Justice Secretary: Chris Grayling said new laws would stop serial offenders who think they can put up 'two fingers to the system'

Criminals who repeatedly flout the law after getting out of jail will be forced to serve their full sentence behind bars, Chris Grayling said today.

A loophole in the rules means the vast majority of offenders who break the terms of their early release get just 28 days back inside before they are let out again.

The loophole applies even if they breach their licence conditions again and again.

But in a new toughening of release rules from the Justice Secretary, repeat offenders will face remaining in jail until the end of their original sentence.

Last night Mr Grayling told the Mail it would stop serial offenders who think they can put up ‘two fingers to the system’.

He said: ‘Like the rest of the public, I’m fed up with offenders who think they can just put two fingers to the system and act like it doesn’t apply to them. It does.

‘That’s why we are closing the loophole for those who just think they can just time and again flout their licence conditions and get away with it.

‘Offenders need to understand that there are tough consequences for poor behaviour - that’s part of how we can tackle reoffending to make sure communities are safer, and that there fewer victims of crime.’ The change will mean a group of serial offenders serving, on average, an additional eight months behind bars before they are released.

The new law affects criminals who persistently break the conditions of their licence after getting released from prison, usually at the half way point.

These conditions can include wearing a tag, not returning to places where they commit crimes, or staying away from victims.

At the moment, the vast majority spend just 28 days in prison for breaches of their licence regardless of how many times they have broken the rules.

They can only be kept inside for longer if they present a ‘high risk’ of causing serious harm to the public.

But when the new law comes in to force, offenders who are ‘non-compliant’ will stay in jail until the Parole Board says they can be trusted not to break the rules.

If the Board decides they will still break the rules, they will stay inside until the end of their jail term.

The new rules are among a series of changes to be debated by MPs today as the Criminal Justice and Courts Bill returns to Parliament.

The flagship Bill also includes longer sentences for perverts caught with sickening pornographic videos depicting rape and a new ‘tax’ on criminals to make them pay for the costs of the courts.

Another central pledge is to end the scandal of police officers doling out repeat cautions to thousands of criminals.

Progress: The new law affects criminals who persistently break the conditions of their licence after getting released from prison, usually at the half way point

Every year nearly 10,000 criminals get a caution for the same offence they committed within the previous two years.

But a ban on repeat cautions will mean serial offenders hauled before the courts for every new offence.

It is expected that around 14,000 fewer cautions will be issued each year.
