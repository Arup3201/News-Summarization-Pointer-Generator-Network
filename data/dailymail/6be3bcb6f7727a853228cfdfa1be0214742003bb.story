Alex Salmond has boasted that a Tory attack poster featuring him and Ed Miliband outside Number 10 will backfire because he is more popular than David Cameron – even in England.

The former First Minister said he was 'definitely less unpopular' than the Prime Minister south of the border and predicted the SNP would hold the balance of power after the election.

The remarks come after Mr Salmond's successor as First Minister, Nicola Sturgeon, said having the SNP in power would be good for the whole of Britain – and boasted that she would order Scottish MPs to vote on laws which only apply in England.

Mr Salmond, who is standing for Parliament in the Aberdeenshire seat of Gordon, said his 'part in history' was yet to be written – but insisted Ms Sturgeon would be in charge of any Coalition negotiations with Labour.

'Anyone who knows Nicola knows she won't let me be a backseat driver,' he told Buzzfeed News.

Mr Salmond insisted he was happy in his new role as the 'bogeyman of the British establishment'.

But he said: 'There's every chance of the SNP becoming the third biggest party in the UK in May.

'The political stars are aligning for a balanced parliament. Neither Cameron or Miliband are capable or deserve a majority, and that leaves space for a hugely substantial SNP influence.

The Conservative Party last week released an election poster raising the 'nightmare' prospect of Mr Salmond propping up a Labour Government in Coalition.

But the SNP heavyweight said: 'The problem for the Tories, and Labour for that matter, is that I'm certainly more popular than David Cameron and Ed Miliband in England.

'Definitely less unpopular, anyway, let's put it that way.'

He said Mr Cameron had let the Chancellor George Osborne become too powerful and dismissed the Labour leader as a 'less than outstanding politician'.

Mr Salmond also revealed that he is still unable to shake hands with members of the public because he seriously damaged his elbow greeting so many people during the referendum campaign.

He became so downhearted after losing the referendum he gave up his 5:2 diet – where you fast on just 600 calories two days a week.

He told Buzzfeed: 'I'm back on it now. I had a break – that diet and losing the referendum would have been a bit much.'

But the Scottish nationalist is also telling disappointed 'yes' voters that there will still be 'another chance' of winning independence.
