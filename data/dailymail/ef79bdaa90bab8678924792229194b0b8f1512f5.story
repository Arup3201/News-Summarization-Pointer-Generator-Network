Claire Goodall, from Surrey, appeared on This Morning to talk about her feelings of isolation after having a baby

Many of Britain's new mothers are struggling to cope with the pressures of having a baby. 

In a new survey, commissioned by AXA PPP healthcare and Netmums, more than a quarter of first-time mums admit to feeling lonely, with 24 per cent also admitting they had no family nearby to help with the workload of caring for a young child.

According to health experts, feelings of loneliness leave young mothers more susceptible to mental health problems like post-natal depression. 

For many women, their social network declines after having a child, with 14 per cent of those questioned admitting said they had lost touch with old friends and colleagues.

This number increases to 25 per cent for young mothers aged 18-24. 

Despite many activity groups tailored to new mothers, more than a quarter of women said they hadn't made any new friends since giving birth. 

This figure increased again for the age group 18-24, with 38 per cent of those questioned giving that answer.   

One women who can sympathise with these feelings is Claire Goodall, from Surrey, who suffered crippling feelings of loneliness after giving birth to her first child two years ago. 

Shortly after giving birth, Claire and her husband relocated to a more rural area with their new baby. 

The lack of friends in the area and issues with public transport left her feeling lost and alone. 

Appearing on This Morning to talk about her experiences in an effort to help other new mothers, Claire revealed that after a couple of months, her feelings of isolation meant that her self-confidence took a nosedive. 

She said: 'I'd mentally prepared myself for it but it turned out to be something out of my control. I didn't expect it to be such a shock to the system.

'I would class myself as very capable, but when you're a new mum and have a baby you don't feel like that.'

Claire tried to join a mother and baby group, but found that she struggled to find anything in common with the other women apart from the fact that they were all mums.  

To make matters worse, the new mother also had trouble getting her child to breastfeed.

She said: 'I spent three months trying to breastfeed... If I didn't open up and say I can't do this any more I wouldn't have been able to do look after my daughter properly.'

Eventually, Claire's emotions got the better of her and she started to spend more and more time at home alone,. until she decided to confide in her husband and other new mothers about the way she was feeling. 

She said: 'I felt a weight come off my shoulders. I felt like I'd been tense for three or four months. 

'My husband would say I like to take control in the house, but I wasn't able to do that. 

'He knew it was important for me to find people to connect with while he was at work.

'People say "don't have structure; you cant have structure with babies", but I need it. 

'I thought, right, every day I'm going to do one little thing that my daughter and I will really enjoy.

'I went out and met two people who will be lifelong friends.'

Baby blogger Amy Ransom, who appeared with Claire on the ITV programme, said: 'There's too much pressure on first-time mothers to live up to expectations. 

'We need to give ourselves a break. 

'When a mother looks like she has it all planned out, you can bet your life she doesn't. 

'We need to make it easy to say "I'm having a difficult time".

'There are toddler groups, play groups and all sorts of baby classes you can go to. 

'But even figuring out how you're going to get there in your car can be difficult - it's a big thing.' 

More young first-time mothers aged 18-24 don't attend baby classes and also feel more isolated

Psychotherapist Christine Webber said: 'Often, first time mothers are not prepared for the fact that when they gain a baby they also lose a great deal of their former lives in the shape of their freedom, job, figure and sex life. 

'It's important that first time mums are familiar with the concept of postnatal depression so that they don't feel too isolated, ashamed or inadequate if it happens to them - and also that they seek help promptly.' 

1. Feelings of loneliness and isolation are not unusual. A proportion of new mothers become seriously depressed following the birth of a baby. This probably won't happen to you - but if you are very sad and weepy do seek help earlier rather than later

2. Get involved with other young mothers via social media and join a mother-and baby group in your area - perhaps a massage baby class - where you will bond with other new mums as they too get used to being parents.

3. If any friends or relatives offer help, do accept it. Of course you want to be seen to be in charge but a couple of hours off to sleep or to go out for a meal with your partner will elevate your mood – and is a responsible thing to do for yourself.

4. Invite friends round. It's easy to lose sight of who you were before you became a parent. Having a laugh and a gossip with good mates is a great way of boosting your mood and helping you to feel more like you.
