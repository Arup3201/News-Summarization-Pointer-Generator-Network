Seventy years after the Allied forces firebombed Dresden, the country remembers the tens of thousands who were burned alive by holding a sombre church service and forming a silent human chain across the city.

10,000 people joined hands along the river Eibe and across bridges in the east-German city, which has seen Europe's biggest neo-Nazi marches on February 13 in recent years.

Delegates from Coventry, Breslau, Ostrava and St Petersburg - cities that also suffered brutal air attacks in the Second World War - lit candles at the Frauenkirche (Church of Our Lady) in the presence of those who survived the deadly bombings.

Solidarity: 10,000 people joined hands to form a giant human chain in Dresden to symbolise peace on the 70th anniversary of the Dresden bombings

Together: In recent years, neo-Nazi's have descended on the city on February 13 to march against Islam

Peace: This year, tens of thousands of 'anti-fascists' gathered on the square outside the church carrying a green banner which read: 'Fight for a humane society'

Leaders: Germany's President Joachim Gauck (second from right) joined the peaceful protesters

Symbolic: The tens of thousands who formed the silent human chain commemorated the people who were 'burned alive' during the bombing of Dresden in 1945

Dresden has recently become the beacon for an anti-Islam movement where as many as 25,000 protesters have marched against what they perceive as the growing influence of the religion.

But tonight, 'anti-fascists' gathered on the square outside the church carrying a green banner which read: 'Fight for a humane society. Take action against the Nazis.'

Germany's president spoke at the church which was left in ruins for years to symbolise the destruction of the Second World War, before being rebuilt.

Joachim Gauck said: 'Bombs and fire indiscriminately annihilated both guilty and innocent, party members and small children, war criminals and nuns, guards and forced labourers, combat soldiers and refugees who had left their homes to save their lives and believed themselves to be in a safe place.'

British and US bombers killed up to 25,000 people in the bombing of Dresden between February 13 and February 15 in 1945, in a bid to crush German morale in the final months of the war.

They dropped at least 3,900 tonnes of explosive and incendiary bombs - unleashing an inferno that melted people where they stood and reduced vast areas in the city to rubble.

Remembrance: A church service was held at the Frauenkirche (Church of Our Lady), which was left in ruins for years to symbolise the destruction that befell Dresden

Connected: The candles this young boy placed on the mantle were lit by delegates from other cities who suffered similar bombings

Tribute: After bells rang out from the church, German President Joachim Gauck said: 'Bombs and fire indiscriminately annihilated both guilty and innocent, party members and small children'

Deceased: President Gauck also remembered the thousands of Jews who died during the war, saying: 'We know who started this murderous war... so we'll never forget the victims of German warfare'

Sombre: The church service commemorated the 25,000 people killed in the Dresden bombings between February 13 and February 15

Anniversary: Archbishop of Canterbury Justin Welby delivering a speech during a memorial service at the Frauenkirche cathedral

Helga Skoczowsky, who was nine at the time, described how she took refuge in the cellar of their apartment building and heard the haunting sound of approaching planes - and the bombs that followed.

Struggling to hold in her tears, she said: 'The noise was dreadful... the light went out... the chimney tops blew off.

'We were covered in black, we had no eyelashes left, our lips were all crusty from the soot and we were all dirty and in the dark.'

When they emerged, there was nothing left of their fourth-floor apartment.

'Everything was glowing and burning. People were running and screaming,' she added.'

The six million Jews who died in the Holocaust were remembered alongside the Germans killed during the raids.

Germany remembered the victims of Nazism and of German bombing according to President Gauck who said: 'We know who started this murderous war... so we'll never forget the victims of German warfare.'

For several months the 'Patriotic Europeans Against the Islamisation of the West' (PEGIDA) has held marches in Dresden. 

Mayor Helma Orosz believes those protests gave this anniversary added importance.

She said: 'February 13, more than any other date in the history of our city, warns us that we must show solidarity with those who flee war, violence and terror around the world.'
