A 63-year-old skier is recovering in hospital after spending three hours digging himself out of an avalanche in Alaska - only to discover his friend lying dead next to him.

Michael Hopper was skiing with 35-year-old Eric Peterson in the Rainbow Mountains, near the Richardson Highway, when the pair were caught in a deadly avalanche, troopers said. 

After being buried in deep snow, Mr Hopper spent three hours digging himself out in freezing temperatures, before spotting Mr Peterson's glove lying on the ground.

He then started digging into surrounding snow and found his friend's dead body, it is said.

Following his horrific discovery on Saturday evening, Mr Hopper, co-owner of nearby Black Rapids Lodge, walked to the highway and flagged down a passing motorist, troopers said.

After receiving a 911 call, troopers and paramedics rushed to the scene, where conditions were found to be unstable, according to NBC.

Although the body of Mr Peterson, from Delta Junction, has been 'tentatively identified' by Mr Hopper, troopers are yet to attempt to recover or identify it due to the dangerous conditions.

In the seconds leading up to the tragedy, Mr Hopper and Mr Peterson were skiing in an area that was deteriorating because of heavy snowfall, it is reported.

The pair then heard a loud 'whoomp' and were buried in snow cascading from 20 feet above them. 

According to Black Rapids Lodge's website, Mr Hopper occupies the lodge with his wife Annie, children Huckleberry Jack and Katie Marie, and their pet dog, Rowdy.

He is currently being treated at Fairbanks Memorial Hospital. His condition is unknown.
