Southampton manager Ronald Koeman has accused Tottenham of unsettling wantaway midfielder Morgan Schneiderlin.

The France international has been axed from the squad to face Bayer Leverkusen after Koeman revealed he is not ‘mentally prepared’ to face the German club.

Tottenham manager Mauricio Pochettino wants to sign Schneiderlin from the club he left earlier this summer, but the Saints are adamant the World Cup player is not for sale.

Schneiderlin wants to follow his former manager to White Hart Lane and has been angered by Southampton’s refusal to sanction his sale. He has trained with the first team for two days this week, but has also spent two days training alone as he strives to improve his fitness.

Frustrated: Ronald Koeman intimated that Tottenham are influencing Schneiderlin’s stance

His desire to quit St Mary’s came to a head yesterday following a training-ground meeting with Koeman and chairman Ralph Krueger.

‘The situation is difficult, the player makes it difficult,’ said Koeman yesterday. ‘I spoke to him with our chairman and the situation has not changed — we won’t sell Schneiderlin and he has to accept that. He is not in the squad to face Leverkusen. He said he is not physically and, even more, mentally prepared for tomorrow.

‘On one side I can understand that. We told him to take the weekend off, think about the situation and on Monday he has to come back.’

Koeman added: ‘He will continue as a football player of Southampton. Now it is up to him.’

The manager intimated that Tottenham are influencing Schneiderlin’s stance. ‘I won’t go as far as to say I’m angry with him because there are some different people behind the player,’ added Koeman.

‘Maybe Tottenham is pressing the player, maybe the agent is pressing him. I know how it works. But I have to do the best for Southampton, that’s my job.’

Weekend off: Schneiderlin has been axed from the Southampton squad to face Bayer Leverkusen

However, while Koeman — who has appointed Jose Fonte team captain after the Portuguese signed a new three-year deal yesterday — claims he is sympathetic towards Schneiderlin, he has warned the Frenchman he will face serious consequences if he does not accept that his immediate future remains on the south coast.

Koeman added: ‘First of all you have to know you signed a contract and respect that. We have given him two days off to think because we will not change our minds.

‘So we will see on Monday. What will happen if he feels the same next week? I will wait until Monday to answer that. But if the situation is the same next week then he has big problems.’

New man at the Lane: Mauricio Pochettino left Southampton for Spurs in May

Fonte said yesterday he hopes Schneiderlin will stay at St Mary’s. ‘It is very simple. Schneiderlin is one of the best midfielders in the Premier League,’ said the new skipper.

‘As a team-mate I always want him in front of me — he has more interceptions and more tackles than anyone else and he runs miles. We want him in the team and we will do everything we can to make him happy so he stays here.’

Southampton are chasing Argentina and Sporting Lisbon left-back Marcos Rojo, while a deal is understood to be close for Steaua Bucharest defender Florin Gardos.

‘We are interested in Gardos but until now they haven’t told me it is signed or done,’ added Koeman.

‘We want Rojo but the transfer is a question for the chairman and (executive director) Les Reed.’
