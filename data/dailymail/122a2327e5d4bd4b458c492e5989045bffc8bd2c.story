Students at a high school in southern California returned to class on Monday to discover that their chemistry teacher had switched gender, adopted a different first name and was dressing as a woman.

Amanda Swager, born Michael, grew up as a boy, but learned as an adult that she was actually genetically female and began transitioning.

Swager, 32, who teaches chemistry at Chino Valley Unified School District, had first notified district leaders about her situation two years ago.

She had originally planned to start teaching as a woman after the summer holidays, but that timetable had to be brought forward after being outed over the weekend while on date.

'I was in a movie theater with my boyfriend, and some students walk in and start shooting pictures of me in a movie theater,' she told KCAL9.

After discussing the situation with the school district, it was decided that Swager should adopt her new identity immediately.

Swager considered her gender very much a personal matter and so the decision was taken to notify only students in her class and their parents, rather than making a blanket announcement to everyone.

'We decided as a district, as a faculty, that it would do more harm than good to do a mass notification,' Swager told NBC4. 'Instead do individual notifications in classrooms where they knew what to expect.'

The district's handling of the matter and Swager sudden change have come in for criticism from some parents who say they support the teacher but feel they should have been notified so they could speak to their kids about it.  

The Chino Valley Unified School District have updated information of their website about Swager after the decision was taken that she would transition to a woman sooner than originally planned

'On a Friday he was a man, on Monday he was woman,' said one parent. 

'This probably brought or is going to bring disruption in the classroom because all these questions need to be answered,' said another, who identified himself as Rusty. 

'They're going to want to know why did the teacher did what he did.'

Students interviewed seem less concerned. 'If it's what she wants to do, I mean, I'm not going to judge. It's what she wants to make her happy,' said a pupil called Madison.

A spokesperson for the Chino Valley Unified School District said they can't comment because it's a personal and private matter for the teacher.

Swager has asked parents to not be angry with the school district. 'I've got nothing but overwhelming support from the school district,' she said.

The teacher also told NBC4 that she has no regrets and now wants to focus on doing her best job in the classroom.

'It's just relaxing to be able to wake up in the morning and just be me,' she said.
