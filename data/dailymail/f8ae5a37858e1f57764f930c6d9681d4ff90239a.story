A high school student has been suspended for dealing  out of his locker. But this teenager was not handling drugs or shifting stolen goods - he was selling Pepsi.

Grade 12 student Keenan Shaw, 17,  was handed a two-day suspension from Winston Churchill High School in Lethbridge, Alberta, last week, after he was found to be selling the soda at a profit form his school locker.

The budding businessman was told that the sales violated the school's nutrition and marketing policies and that he was operating a business without a licence, the Calgary Sun reported. 

Under the school board's Healthy Nutritional Choices Policy, sugary sodas are not allowed in the schools. Diet versions, on the other hand, are permitted.

Keenan noted that compared to what other students have been known to sell at the high school, his own transgressions were in fact minor.

'I'm not going to name any names, but I know a couple of people selling marijuana, he said. 'There's kids selling smokes, there was a kid last year selling meth, as well as a kid selling acid.'

The student has been told that he will be expelled from the school should he continue to sell the bootleg soda.

Keenan's mother, Alyssa Shaw-Letourneau, claimed that  the school's punishment for her son is too extreme.

'From a business perspective, what he did was actually very smart, and if you look at [it] from the perspective of profit, 140 per cent is pretty good,' she said.

Cheryl Gilmore, superintendent of the Lethbridge public school board, yesterday said she could not speak about the individual student's case, CBC News reported.

But she explained that the school rules state that a principal has to be consulted before an item can be sold on school property.

'We can't just have anyone coming into the school selling anything they want in the school,' she said.

'There's a distribution of merchandise policy, but we would never suspend someone. We would talk to them about it, we would talk to them about why it doesn't follow our nutrition policy. 

'So there would be lots of talk and fair warning, and opportunity to work with the school administration, before it would ever get to the point of a suspension.'

Although selling a Pepsi isn't enough for a suspension, Gilmore said 'persistent or chronic disobedience or disregard for district or school rules' is sufficient grounds.

Keenan now says that he's learned his lesson - although it might not be the one the school intended for him.

'I've learned a lot about business and authority as well as supply and demand, as well as how location ties into all these factors,' he said.

The student has now shifted his fledgling business outside to the sidewalk.

'I can walk out to the sidewalk, make the trade off, and walk back into the school,' Shaw said, noting that he'd sold a couple cans by finding that 'little loophole.'
