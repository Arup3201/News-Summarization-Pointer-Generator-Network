Some of us have probably said before that we love chocolate so much we wish we could swim in it, but now there really is the option to bathe in our favourite treat.

Bathroom company Bathrooms.com has teamed up with Choccywoccydoodah to produce an incredibly ornate - not to mention calorific - bathroom, with bath, sink, toilet and even bidet made entirely from the sweet stuff.

On sale for £80,000 the 'Maderno Sweet' is made of 50kg of Belgian chocolate, containing a whopping 9.4 million calories in total - more than a decade's worth.

Bathrooms.com teamed up with Choccywoccydoodah to produce a bathroom suite made from chocolate

If you're willing to wait the two to three months needed for the suite to be made and delivered, it  will last you up to six months, provided you keep it at room temperature - and can refrain from nibbling on it for that long.

The idea for this chocolate masterpiece came to Bathrooms.com CEO Ian Monk after he realised that each year over a million Britons misspell 'suite' as 'sweet' when hunting for a new bathroom online.

The cocoa bathroom comes in at 9.4 MILLION calories, equating to more than one decades worth

The bath tub alone has 8 million calories and will set you back no less than £50,000

Sickly suite: The basin comes in at a hefty 210,000 calories and the toilet at a whopping 980,000

The french bathroom accessory, the bidet, is worth a hundred times a woman's recommended daily allowance of calories

 'That simple mistake caught our imagination, what if we created a bathrooms suite, out of something sweet?' says Ian on the company's website.

Total bathroom: 9.4 million calories, £80,000

Bath: 8 million calories, £50,000

Toilet: 980,000 calories, £14,000

Basin: 210,000 calories, £9,000

Bidet: 210,000 calories, £7,000

'When we came across Choccywoccydoodah, we knew they were the perfect fit. Renowned for their imaginative and playful design, their creations even featured in Tim Burton's Charlie And The Chocolate Factory, so we knew they'd have no trouble creating a complete, life-sized bathroom suite, out of 100% chocolate. 

'Luckily for us, they accepted challenge!'

Despite it's jokey beginning and unusual materials, the Maderno Sweet is fully-functional - even down to the 980,000 calorie toilet.

However, Ian warns potential buyers against actually attempting to use it. 

'It will melt if it comes in contact with direct sunlight, radiator heat or hot liquids – so it's not ideal for running that relaxing bath!'
