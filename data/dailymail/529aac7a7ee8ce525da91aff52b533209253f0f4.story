This is the moment a train announcer stunned passengers by announcing over a tannoy as they pulled into a station to beware of pickpockets and gipsies.

The London Midland service had been pulling into Telford Station, Shropshire, on Saturday when the comments were made. 

Passenger Chris Downes, 46, was recording on his mobile at the time and the announcer can clearly be heard saying: 'Telford Central - please be aware of pickpockets and gipsies'.

The remark was mainly greeted by cheers from Shrewsbury Town football fans travelling back from their game against Wolverhampton Wanderers. 

But London Midland said it is now launching an investigation into the incident on board the 17.25 Wolverhampton to Shrewsbury service.

Yesterday Wolves fan Mr Downes, who was on his way home to Bayston Hill, Shropshire, with son Jack, 14, said: 'There had been loads of banter between the fans sharing carriages, which threatened to boil over. The atmosphere was a bit hostile at times.

'The announcement diluted the situation quite a bit and helped lighten the mood, to be honest.'But I thought at the time he might get into a bit of trouble for it. Which is shame really, because I’m sure it was intended in good humour.

'When we got to Shrewsbury he said "Welcome back to civilisation" and I for one am looking forward to travelling on his train again in future.

'There’s not enough train drivers with a sense of humour and I think his comments were only made in jest.'

However, other passengers and residents of Telford yesterday reacted with disgust at the 'unprofessional' and 'offensive' comments. 

Mark Peaker, 47, a father-of-three, from Telford said: 'I couldn’t believe what I was hearing - they have not only used a derogatory term they have managed to offend an entire town. 

'It suggests we are just a town full of thieves, which is not the case at all. Somebody in a professional role should not be insulting places while they are working.

'I’m all for them having a sense of humour but this was not funny at all and I hope he is disciplined for his unprofessional actions.'

One Wolves fan, who lives in Telford but wished to remain anonymous, was travelling back home from the derby match at Molineux, which ended 0-0. 

He said: 'I couldn’t believe it. I was utterly flabbergasted.

'Tensions among fans were already high after the match and I don’t think that helped the situation at all.

'Telford is actually a really nice place to live. It certainly isn’t up to a train announcer to make insulting comments about it.'

The Gipsy Council called for the matter to be taken up with the police and branded the remarks as racist.

Bill Kerswell, a spokesman for the council, said: 'This is unlawful, it is a racist comment. 

'It is the same as using any offensive word relating to homosexuals or people of colour.

'I would think it is a police matter and I hope they take it up and look into it.'

A spokesman for the train company thanked passengers for drawing it to their attention and added: 'We do not tolerate any sort of comment of that kind made by anyone on our trains and will be looking into it immediately.'
