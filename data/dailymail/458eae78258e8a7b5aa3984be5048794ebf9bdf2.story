A Brooklyn cab driver's daughter testified against him in court this week, more than a year after she fled an arranged marriage and he allegedly ordered a hit on her lover's family.

Both Amina Ajmal, 23, and her father Mohammad Ajmal Choudhry cried in court as prosecutors asked the young woman to identify him. It was the first time either had seen each other since December 2012 - at Ajmal's depressing wedding ceremony in their native Pakistan.

During her testimony on Wednesday and Thursday, Ajmal described the once-loving relationship she had with her father - detailing her happy childhood growing up in the Brooklyn neighborhood of Flatbush.

'Honor killings': Mohammad Ajmal Choudhry, a Brooklyn cab driver, stands accused of conspiring to murder the family of his daughter's boyfriend after she fled her loveless arranged marriage

But their relationship soured when Ajmal left her loveless marriage and ran away to America with boyfriend Shujat Abbas. She told the court that her father threatened to kill her and members of her boyfriend's family in what has been described as 'honor killings'.

Choudhry stands accused of conspiring to kill Abbas' father and sister and could spend the rest of his life in prison if convicted. He has plead not guilty.

The defense claims that Choudhry, who was in Brooklyn at the time of the deaths in Pakistan, had no hand in them. They say government agents coached the daughter on how to manipulate her father into making empty threats that were recorded for use as evidence against him.

Ajmal, 23, was born in Pakistan where she lost her mother at a young age.

She moved to Brooklyn with her Muslim father in 1999 when she was nine, where she grew up living a Westernized life.

Asked earlier to describe their relationship, Ajmal responded, 'We were very close. ... He loved me.'

She spoke highly of how he drove his taxi seven days a week to provide for the family.

Ajmal says she was allowed to have a cellphone, use Facebook and watch TV. She also attended school all the way through college.

But many parts of her life were still anchored in conservative Pakistan. She says she first heard about the arranged marriage to cousin Abrar Ahmed Babar when she was just 10 years old. Her father organized the union so that Babar could gain U.S. citizenship to move to America as well.

Ajmal and her father first came to a head when he found her messaging Abbas on Facebook in 2009, after meeting the young man from her village at her sister's wedding.

That year, the father and daughter traveled back to their native village of Chiryawala for another marriage, but Ajmal got a surprise when her father said she wouldn't be returning home to New York.

'He told me I was too Americanized, and I need to learn my culture,' she testified.

Stuck in Pakistan, Ajmal continued to communicate with Abbas using a secret cellphone, until caught by her uncle.

'He told me "your father gave me permission to kill you if you donâ€™t marry Babar,"' she said.

Inevitably, Ajmal gave in and married Babar in a sad ceremony in December 2012.

Footage of the wedding was shown in court this week. Both the bride and groom looked downcast. Footage of Ajmal's sibling's weddings was used as contrast, and showed actual joy, dancing, rifle shooting and money throwing.

Clearly depressed in her marriage, Ajmal soon decided to flea the country and return to America early last year with Abbas where she lived in hiding. However she continued to retain some contact with her father, over the phone.

When Choudhry began threatening to track down the man and kill him unless she returned home and restored the family's honor, she agreed to let federal agents record their phone calls. On tapes played for the jury, he can be heard repeatedly bemoaning the humiliation he felt over her disobedience.

In their culture, sons were free to come and go, he explained. But, he added, 'When a daughter runs away, parents are demeaned forever.' He warned in another recording, 'If you don't come back, there is only death.'

Shortly after Ajmal learned that the victims had been gunned down in Pakistan, she called her father and asked, 'Have you done this?'

He responded that another person 'killed this time and made me part of it.' But he also repeated the threat that he would 'not leave a single member of their family alive' if she didn't return home.

News of the killings had made him 'a man of no honor,' he lamented. 'My daughters are whores. ... You still have time. Think about it in the next 24 hours.'

'What will you do after 24 hours?'

'What else? Another person will be gone.'
