A spurned boyfriend pretended to be his former lover on a 'hook-up' website and sent men looking for sex to her home, a court heard.

David McGowan, 28, from Cottingham, near Hull, set up a fake profile in Rebecca Millward’s name on a 'hook-up' website and directed strangers wanting a casual fling to turn up at her home in Brighton unannounced.

He used photographs he'd taken of the 25-year-old nurse during their relationship to create the profile before, pretending to be her, sending out her address inviting men to her flat.

Miss Millward told Beverley Magistrates' Court she became too 'scared' to answer the door, and worried that the photographs of her would be found by colleagues and patients.

In a statement read out in court, Miss Millward said: 'I am worried about the photos that were put on the website.

'I have just qualified as a nurse, and I am worried patients and colleagues can see them and that it looks unprofessional.

'Whenever the phone goes or someone knocks on my door during the day, I worry.  When men were arriving at my home, I felt unsafe, and I don’t want to be home alone.'

The court heard that Miss Millward ended the nine-month, long-distance relationship with McGowan last September.

On New Year’s Eve, McGowan, a consultant in the asbestos industry, was given a harassment order after bombarding her with emails, texts and Facebook messages, and received a police caution for setting up a fake profile on the 'hook-up' site.

But last month he sent another email and tried to call her using the online videophone service, Skype.  In the meantime, men started appearing at Miss Millward’s door again.

Prosecutor Andrew Vaughan told magistrates: 'The police, rather generously, gave him a caution but I am afraid it did not stop there.

'She checked online again and found further hook-up profiles.

'He admitted setting up the fake internet accounts and sending her address out to men to get them to her flat.'

John Seagrave said in mitigation that
 McGowan had taken the break-up badly because Miss Millward did not give
 him a reason for it.

'The court can be reassured that Mr McGowan is very much regretful of what has happened,' he said.

'He accepts the relationship is over. A lot of what happened arose from him never being given a reason; a proper, satisfactory explanation as to why she wanted to end the relationship.'

He said McGowan, who got rid of the profile by contacting the website, could not remember sending the email, believed he was drunk when he did so, and that Miss Millward did not answer the Skype call.

McGowan pleaded guilty to harassment,

Chairman of the bench David Smith warned McGowan they were dealing with 'serious matters', before adjourning the sentencing for reports.

McGowan was bailed until 7 April on the condition he doesn't approach or communicate with Miss Millward and doesn't create online accounts in her name.
