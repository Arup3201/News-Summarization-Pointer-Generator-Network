Dejan Lovren's wife posted her dismay on Instagram after her husband was dropped from the Liverpool squad that lost 1-0 to Real Madrid in the Bernabeu.

Seven first-team regulars, also including skipper Steven Gerrard, Raheem Sterling and Mario Balotelli, were rested on Tuesday night, which led to accusations of Brendan Rodgers waving the white flag in Madrid.

Anita Lovren made the trip to the game at the Bernabeu and posted a picture of their daughter in the stands, apparently confused by why her father didn’t make the side.

The image had the caption ‘Why my daddy doesn’t play????’, which suggests that despite Lovren's struggles this season, his family did not think he deserved to miss out completely at the Bernabeu.

Lovren was replaced in the Liverpool line-up by Kolo Toure as the visitors' rearguard action meant Real only came out with a 1-0 victory.

And the fear for the Croatia centre half, bought for £20million from Southampton in the summer, is that he will not find his way back into the side after Toure's impressive display at the heart of the defence.

Toure said: 'I have missed games like this.

'I play with my heart and I am ready to fight for my club.

'These are the kind of games you remember all your life. The last game I played here was with Arsenal when we won.

'People were saying we had no chance against Real Madrid but that gave us motivation.

'When you don't play a lot and a manager gives you a chance to show what you can do you give everything you have got.

'That is what happened and that's the way we need to play in every game now. We all showed the manager we will fight.'
