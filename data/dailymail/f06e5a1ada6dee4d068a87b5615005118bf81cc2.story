They are considered the world's greatest natural and man-made wonders attracting millions of awe-inspired tourists from around the world every year.

But many discerning members of TripAdvisor were less than impressed, giving Christ the Redeemer, the Grand Canyon, Niagara Falls and many other sites one-star reviews.

One said the statue in Rio de Janeiro was 'just a pillar' and described it as 'a pathetic and shoddy piece of concrete'.

In a review warning people not to bother with the Grand Canyon, it is described as an 'overblown sandy ditch' by a disgruntled visitor who wished he'd 'stayed in my hotel room and watched a DVD instead'.

Grand Canyon: The natural wonder of the world in Arizona did not impress everyone, receiving a number of one-star reviews including one which called it an 'overblown sandy ditch' and saying 'nature is c***'

Christ the Redeemer: This Rio attraction was called 'over-rated' and just a 'concrete pillar' in one-star reviews

The beautiful Niagara Falls - on the border of the United States and Canada - was branded a 'dump' and the 'pits' ruined by 'litter louts'.

One said: 'Niagara falls is boring and quite possibly the most boring thing you could do. Also it's so expensive you should take that money and stay at a Ritz-Carlton for the night. And don't take the boat. It lasts for 10 minutes and you wait for 3 hours'. 

Another said: 'Niagara is the pits everywhere I looked litter over flowing from buckets .People were just dropping stuff everywhere'. 

Across North America in San Francisco, there are several complaints about the city's famous Golden Gate Bridge.

One couple were 'unhappy' saying that its 'colour was not as advertised' and another reviewer called it 'pointless visiting' say that people should 'buy a postcard instead'. 

Tourists were also disappointed with the Great Sphinx at Giza in Egypt, with several complaining it was 'tiny' and one upset holidaymaker saying it was 'covered in litter and next to McDonalds'.

The Sphinx and the Pyramids: Tourists called the Sphinx 'tiny' and surrounded by 'scum of the earth'. Visitors to the Pyramids said it was just camels and Brits in leggings

Another one-star review said it was 'surrounded' by 'scum of the earth who will steal from you and harass you from the moment you arrive until all you want to do is leave'.

Meanwhile one reviewer criticised the nearby Pyramids of Giza, calling his experience 'horrendous'.

He wrote: 'The pyramids are nice to look at and are definitely something to see, however that is if you can see past the dying/dead horses and dogs, and people harassing you for money on camels, coupled with overweight brits wearing see through leggings.' 

Britain's Stonehenge was called 'just a bunch of stones in a field' that keeps visitors interested for 'a second or two'.

One visitor to Hadrian's Wall asked: 'Where's the wall?' and said anyone thinking of going shouldn't bother and head to Italy instead for 'better ruins, better weather and better food'.

Another said people would have 'more fun at a funeral' than at Hadrian's Wall. 

Big Ben did not fare any better in the scathing reviews with some observant reviewers calling it 'just a big clock.'

Eiffel Tower: The Paris landmark was written off as an 'ugly waste of time' set in one of the world's dirtiest cities

One reviewer wrote: 'Its just a big clock and the whole experience left me unsettled' while a reviewer gave it a one-star review because  he 'couldn't see Big Ben anywhere'.

Another British attraction slapped with a one star rating is the Angel of the North in Gateshead which was dubbed as 'RUSTY JUNK' and an 'horrendous item' that 'looks like an aeroplane that has been upended and planted cockpit first'.

The British Museum, home to the Elgin Marbles and the Rosetta Stone, was also dealt a blow with visitors scoring it one star and branding it 'coma inducing'.

A London reviewer said: 'I'm really sorry, but I just don't see the lure to this museum. My son and I really tried to like the exhibits but it was just so so boring.'

While another reviewer complained there wasn't much British about it and said: 'Sorry, but it would be empty without the Greeks and Egyptians.'

Niagara Falls: The great North American waterfall was branded a 'dump' and the 'pits' ruined by 'litter louts' surrounded by 'rip-off' shops

Golden Gate Bridge: Unimpressed visitors to San Francisco said it was the wrong colour while another said it was just foggy and people should just buy a postcard instead

The royal residence of Buckingham Palace was slammed by one reviewer as a 'quintessential tourist trap'.

The Colosseum in Rome earned a one star rating due to one visitor considering it 'nothing special'.

A Liverpool reviewer warned tourists off visiting the Eiffel Tower in Paris saying 'don't go'.

While a Newcastle reviewer said: 'The Eiffel tower is an ugly tower made popular by contemporary media, it is nothing really, but a waste of time to visit.'

Hadrian's Wall: One visitor said it is 'more fun at a funeral' and 'full of weirdos' and another asked: 'Where's the wall?'

Stonehenge: The ancient stones in rural Britain are just 'big bits of stone in a big field' and another said they would 'do anything' to get the time spent there back

The Sistine Chapel has not escaped its share of bad reviews with one man saying he was 'pushed through like cattle by security who bellow out 'silenzio' and 'sssh' and patrol for those taking photos! Horrible.' 

Whereas another reviewer told his fellow tourists 'don't go inside' the Taj Mahal.

Another reviewer warned tourists to avoid Times Square 'like the plague' and called it 'an incredible assault on your senses.'
