A 14-year-old Pennsylvania boy was arrested after he posed as a woman on Facebook and tricked 48 boys into sending him nude photos and gift cards.

The teen created a profile under the name of Jessica Carabello and promised to provide naked photographs of 'her' if they sent images of themselves in return.

The unidentified boy was charged with theft by extortion, transmission of sexually explicit images and solicitation, according to the Pocono Mountain Regional police.

In 2013, 18-year-old Mitchell Franklin Louws (pictured) posed as a woman online and solicited compromising photos from boys as young as 13

He then threatened to post the boys' images online if they did not continue to send photographs. 

The teen used similar threats to extort gift cards. 

Officials said the teen sent messages to at least 100 additional boys who did not respond.

He has been released into his parents' custody and will appear in juvenile court next month. 

In 2013, an 18-year-old boy from North Carolina was arrested after posing as a woman online to solicit compromising photos of boys as young as 13. 

Mitchell Franklin Louws also promised the boys he would have sex with them if they 'passed a test' and had sex with a man, according to WRAL.com

He then told the boys he would post their images online and send them to their family members  if he did not receive more.

Louws pleaded guilty to sexually exploiting a minor and extortion. 

He served eight months in jail and had to register as a sex offender.
