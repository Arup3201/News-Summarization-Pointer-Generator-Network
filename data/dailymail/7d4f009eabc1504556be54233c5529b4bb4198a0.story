He spent his glittering football career globe-trotting his way around the world.

But David Beckham has finally found himself returning to his roots after taking a role in classic sitcom, Only Fools and Horses.

It shows the star sitting in a greasy spoon café alongside the actors, who are dressed in the same outfits they wore during the programme’s original run.

The sketch will be shown on Friday 21st March, after it was filmed earlier this month.

It comes more than 10 years after the classic comedy was last shown on television in 2003 for a one-off Christmas special.

It is understood that none of the show’s 
other former cast members are set to appear in the spoof film, which was
 shot just days before the death of actor Roger Lloyd Pack, who played 
the character of Trigger in the popular show.

Hit: Only Fools And Horses was broadcast from 1981 to 1991, and returned for a Christmas special in 2003

Collector: The 38-year-old was keen to buy the back door of the famous three-wheeled Robin Reliant car (right with Jason and Lyndhurst) when it went up for auction in 2007 but sources claim Victoria put him off the idea

The sitcom, about two London market 
traders, was an enormous success in Britain, where it was broadcast on 
BBC1 between 1981 and 1991 and made stars out of actors Sir David and 
Nicholas Lyndhurst.

A 
series of highly-anticipated Christmas specials were also shown until 
2003, when Del Boy finally made his millions by selling an antique 
watch.

Former Manchester United star David Beckham, who retired from the sport last year, has since returned to live in London following spells playing football in Spain, Los Angeles, Milan and France, is said to be a huge fan of the show, which counted more than 20 million viewers at the height of its popularity in the 1990s.

Seasoned: This is not Beckham's first foray in Sport Relief comedy - he was in a sketch with his friend James Corden, who was playing his Gavin and Stacey character Smithy, in 2010

The 38-year-old, who grew up in East London, previously considered buying the back door of the famous three-wheeled Robin Reliant car driven by the show’s characters Del Boy Trotter and Rodney, after it was put up for auction in 2007.

At the time he was said to be keen to hang the piece of merchandise in his Los Angeles mansion, but was said to have been put off the idea by his wife Victoria.
