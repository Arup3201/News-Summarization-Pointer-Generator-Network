U2's disastrous album giveaway has received the SNL treatment as it became the butt of a joke about the nude celebrity selfies hack.

The show, hosted this week by Chris Pratt, addressed the latest leak of nude celebrity photos - which involved Ariana Grande, who gave tonight's musical performances.

In a word of advice to victims of the widespread iCloud hack, Colin Jost said: 'You could always hide them in that free U2 album, no one will look there'.

The joke will come as yet another shattering blow to Apple as the firm desperately tries to tighten its iCloud security and advise angry iPhone users on how to delete the album Songs Of Innocence.

Last week, Apple launched a special ‘button’ for iTunes customers – simply so they can delete his band’s latest album from their accounts.

Thousands of users complained when they were given a free copy of Songs Of Innocence without asking for it.

As Apple chief executive Tim Cook desperately tried to reconcile the situation, Apple executives have been grappling to tighten security following the nude selfies hack.

Apple has admitted it is 'actively investigating' the claims that a flaw in the 'Find My iPhone' function of its iCloud service may have helped a hacker to steal nude photos of Jennifer Lawrence and '100 other celebrities'.

Naked photos hacked from celebrities including Kim Kardashian, Rhianna and Amber Heard are still believed to be easily accessible on social media sites.

Two topless images of Rihanna appeared online via 4chan and Reddit on Sunday while Heard has been one hardest-hit celebrities, with more than 50 nude snaps of her surfacing. 

According to TMZ, one featured a message believed to be for her fiancé Johnny Depp.

Despite stringent policies about removing abusive content, the images remained in the public sphere today - and were believed to be easily accessible on Twitter. 

Nearly 24 hours after the first publication of the images on September 1, Apple issued a statement, but the tech giant couldn't say how the alleged breach occurred and didn't offer any guarantee to its hundreds of millions of customers worldwide that the service is safe to use.

'We take user privacy very seriously and are actively investigating this report,' Apple spokeswoman Nat Kerris told MailOnline. 

Executives hoped the long-awaited launch of the iPhone 6 on September 6 would deflect attention from the scandal.

But on September 15, Apple chief executive Tim Cook announced that all 500 million iTunes customers would automatically receive a digital version of the album in their accounts ahead of its release next month.

But it seems many were not impressed, with thousands of protests on social media.

Some customers said they felt as though the album had been forced upon them by Apple.

To make things worse, others complained that they could not find an easy way to remove it from their iTunes libraries.

The protests prompted Apple to create the online tool allowing customers to get rid of the album.

It comes with a message: ‘If you would like U2’s Songs Of Innocence removed from your iTunes music library and iTunes purchases, you can choose to have it removed.

‘Once the album has been removed from your account, it will no longer be available for you to redownload as a previous purchase. If you later decide that you want the album, you will need to get it again.’

Apple’s senior vice president Eddy Cue announced two weeks ago that 33 million iTunes users had so far accessed the album. 

He described the figure as record-breaking, although he did not elaborate.
