Power couple: Zara Phillips and husband Mike Tindall

With no HRH to her name – and no state funding to match – she’s the royal who has had to make her own way in the world.

Now it can be revealed just how well Zara Phillips has managed – with a little help from her rugby playing husband, of course.

By capitalising on her royal background, the Olympic silver medal-winning eventer rakes in an estimated £1million a year from sponsorship.

And with her husband – former England rugby captain Mike Tindall, who earns a six-figure sum every year – Miss Phillips has made a small fortune from property and letting deals.

And then there are the lucrative celebrity magazine shoots. Most recently they sold the first pictures of their baby, Mia Grace, for an estimated £40,000.

Last year, Zara and her husband sold their five-bedroom home in Cheltenham for £1.27million, having bought it for £800,000 in 2009, making a profit of nearly £500,000.

They have now moved into a property on Princess Anne’s Gatcombe Park estate, where Zara has stables and trains her horses. It is not known whether they own the cottage or pay any rent for it.

Tindall himself still owns a £400,000 three-bedroom flat in a Georgian terrace in the centre of Bath, which he rents out for around £1,500 per month. 

And he owns a £300,000 three-bedroom flat in Dubai, which he also lets. 

Experts suggest that it could treble in price by 2020, leaving him with a £600,000 profit should he choose to sell.

Tindall, 35, earns a salary at Gloucester Rugby Club, where he is a player-coach, and for his roles as an ambassador for brokers UFXMarkets and Artemis Fund Managers.

He also has a company, Kimble Trading, of which he is the sole director and shareholder, which had £257,000 in the bank in 2008 and has made a relatively modest £197,000 over the last five years.

He owns a quarter-share in racehorse Monbeg Dude, which has won £120,000 in prize money and is worth more than £200,000, and he has invested bonuses earned during the height of his professional success on the stock market.

However, it is his wife who is the breadwinner. 

Experts believe Zara’s status as a royal triples her worth to between £300,000 and £500,000 a year per sponsor.

The most significant deal is with outdoor clothing line Musto, which could be worth up to £800,000 a year 

The Queen’s granddaughter was paid a six-figure sum to lend her name to video game Howrse, in which players own, train and compete on a virtual horse

More controversially, however, she has become the first royal to sign a deal with an online gaming firm. 

The Queen’s granddaughter was paid a six-figure sum to lend her name to video game Howrse, in which players own, train and compete on a virtual horse.

Zara is also an ambassador for Rolex and Land Rover and has worked for Samsung, the Magic Millions horse sale in Australia, as well as the same fund managers as her husband, Artemis. 

Simon Rines, of the International Journal of Sports Marketing and Sponsorship, said: ‘There simply isn’t anyone else like her and her royalness, for want of a better word, is a unique selling point.’

A spokesman for the couple was contacted about this article but did not offer any comment.
