A 50-year-old man was charged with committing a sex act with an animal and burglary in a Chicago court on Saturday.

Gerardo Perez is being held after animal welfare workers found him in a cage with a pit bull terrier at the Chicago Animal Care and Control Facility having just engaged in 'sexual contact' with the white and grey dog on Wednesday.

Perez was taking part in a group tour of the animal shelter located at 2741 South Western Avenue on Wednesday when he left the group, the Cook County Bond Court heard yesterday.

An employee of the Chicago Animal Care and Control Facility told the court he spotted Perez in a restricted area of the facility and told him to leave.Â 

The employee 'returned a short time later and found [the] defendant still in a cage with a white and gray pit bull,' Assistant Cook County State Attorney Amanda Pillsbury told Cook County Judge Maria Kuriakos Ciesil.

Prosecutors allege Perez was on his hands and knees on the side of the dog, and appeared to have had just had sex with the animal.

'Defendant made inculpatory statements regarding sexual conduct with the dog to other facility employees,' the court heard.

A security guard at the facility demanded Perez's driver's license and he was arrested at his home on Friday for felony sexual contact and burglary.

The burglary charge relates to Perez's trespassing on a restricted part of the 54,0000 square foot facility, which according to the Chicago Animal Care and Control Facility website houses more than 500 animals in separate kennels.

Judge Maria Kuriakos Ciesil ordered Perez bailed in lieu of $80,000 bail.
