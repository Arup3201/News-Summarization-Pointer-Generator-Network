Just two days ago Kate Moss was unveiling her hotly anticipated collection for Topshop but there's no rest for the world's most famous supermodel.

Aside from her fashion designing duties, 40-year-old Kate has been quietly creating a new beauty range for Rimmel London.

The colourful collection of mascaras, lipsticks, eyeliners and nail varnish is bound to brighten up the nation's make-up bags this season and Kate shows us how to work the season's best beauty trends in the new campaign imagery.

Does she ever stop? Kate Moss has unveiled a new beauty range for Rimmel London and models the colour-popping shades in the new imagery

Kate, who has been working with the beauty giant for several years, has created her first-ever eye collection called Idol Eyes - a fitting name for the world-famous supermodel.

Speaking about the range, which includes glimmering hues of pink, green, blue and black mascaras, she said: 'My new Idol Eyes Collection was inspired by my favourite gem stones and jewels.

'The intense authentic shades of mascara, eye colour and liner are perfect for creating either a statement or more subtle eye look.'

Kate has also created four shadow sticks, which aim to illuminate eyes in one stroke, and to recreate her legendary eyeliner flick, fans can use her gel liner in dark emerald green.

Boho babe: Speaking about the inspiration behind her boho themed beauty line, she said: 'I've always loved the laid-back bohemian look because it's all about individual creativity and self-expression'

Kate has added her own range to the Salon Pro nail polish collection and explains that she has created five Bohemian shades, which will no doubt perfectly complement her new Topshop range.

As for lips, Kate's previous collections have been some of the brand's best-selling and she has capitalised on this by expanding it.

'I've always loved the laid-back bohemian look because it's all about individual creativity and self-expression,' she said.

'I've worked with Rimmel to create a palette that combines rich, earthy tones with cool brights and soft nudes.

'Using the shades in my Urban Bohemian Collection for lips and nails, you can create a look as strong or as romantic as you like.'

Kate's new Rimmel collection, which lands on May 14, comes just days after she unveiled her new range for Topshop.

The
 model's SS14 collection is full of seventies-style pieces
 including fringed suede jackets, jump suits and maxi dresses.

There's also embroidered smock-tops, silk blouses and graphic print kaftans that will go on sale in High Street stores globally and online.

Vintage vibe: The collection includes maxi dresses for evening and day wear with many items inspired by Kate's own wardrobe

Kate is said to have taken 
inspiration from her own wardrobe, which despite her status as a 
supermodel, isn't just full of designer labels. She's also a fan of 
scouring the rails of second hand stores.

A weave waistcoat, suede 
shorts and a deep blue fringed jacket are all in keeping with the 
Seventies vibe. The latter is said to be inspired by a jacket the 
40-year-old has worn to three Rolling Stones concerts which she refers 
to as her 'gig 
jacket'.

As well as 
channelling a vintage look, she was also keen to reflect her laidback 
style. There are baggy pyjama trousers glammed up through the use of satin 
material in distinct prints and cool kaftans perfect for hitting the 
beach in over the summer.

Print kaftans and blouses are a wardrobe staple for jetsetter Kate, while a girl can't have enough LBDs

For evening wear, there are sexy frilled flapper style dresses and long numbers that flash a hint of thigh. Many of the dresses are also in keeping with the vintage-feel making use of fringing, sequins and  crepe satin.

Meanwhile there are also some tailored pieces for smart office wear including tuxedo style outfits and trouser suits as well as summery floral printed shirts.

While much of the collection will be sold at affordable prices, one dress is a more pricey £600.

The high price tag is to reflect the precise work that went into creating the densely hand-beaded dress.

Kate first collaborated with Topshop in 2007 before taking a break to work on other projects.
