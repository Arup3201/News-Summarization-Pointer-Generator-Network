Bernard McSorley was jailed for life today at Preston Crown Court after being convicted of murder

A 53-year-old man besotted with a woman 30 years his junior stabbed to death a young love rival who he feared was about to start dating her.

Bernard McSorley gave himself the pet name 'Papa Smurf' while he called 23-year-old Lorna Nardone 'Baby Smurf'.

But he flew into a jealous rage when he discovered she had developed feelings for father-of-two Paul McDonagh, 30.

McSorley stabbed Mr McDonagh in the back with a Stanley knife in Lancaster, saying: 'You're a dead man.'

He later told friends: 'He was making a c*** of me - a few more people are going to get slashed.'

Mr McDonagh was treated at Lancaster Royal Infirmary and told to see his GP the following week.

But he refused to stay in hospital for further assesssment and was found dead five days later.

Tests showed the cause of death was due to shock and internal bleeding due to the stab wound to his back.

Police who caught up with McSorley discovered he had previously served a prison sentence for attempted murder after attacking an ex-partner with an axe.

He was jailed for life today at Preston Crown Court after being convicted of murder. He must serve a minimum of 25 years in jail before being considered for parole.

The victim, a keen guitarist nicknamed 'Hightower' due to his 6ft7in frame, had moved to Lancaster from Maidstone after his partner was found to have a muscle degenerative disease and wanted to be closer to her family.

He met McSorley at a community centre in the city in October last year and they began feuding over Miss Nardone.

Paul Reid QC prosecuting said: 'The attack appears to have been motivated by McSorley’s jealousy towards Paul McDonagh.

'McSorley had developed feelings for a much younger woman, Lorna Nardone, but she did not reciprocate those feelings and had feelings for Paul McDonagh.’

On the morning of the stabbing, Miss Nardone, Mr McDonagh and another man were at Lancaster bus station when they saw McSorley.

When McSorley saw McDonagh and Miss Nardone together, he shouted 'you’re going to get it.'

Later that day, McSorley was seen running towards where Mr McDonagh was sitting behind TK Maxx.

Eye witnesses described seeing McSorley remove his jacket and shirt and place them on a nearby bench before running at Mr McDonagh, who was sitting on steps talking to a friend. The killer then walked away and dumped the Stanley knife down a drain.

Mark Chapman, who was with both men at the time of the attack, told the court: 'He was pretty angry. I think he was showing off. He said a few more people are going to get slashed.'

McSorley later claimed he was acting in self defence, saying he bought a knife from a pound shop when he was advised to 'watch his back' when he heard Mr McDonagh was looking for him.

He denied murder but a jury took just one hour and 25 minutes to convict him.

During the trial Miss Nardone gave evidence telling how she and McSorley referred to each other as 'Papa Smurf' and 'Baby Smurf.'

When quizzed by Mr Reid about McSorley's feelings for her, she grew agitated and shouted: 'That’s Papa Smurf, he shouldn’t be in prison for murder, I know that for a fact.'

In a statement Mr McDonagh’s partner 
Denise Daniel said: 'He was an amazing dad. He used to do the school 
run, cooking, cleaning, he was pretty much a full time dad because I was
 finding things difficult, my disease means I’m different from one day 
to the next.

'He was creative, very artistic, his passion was music and he played the guitar and wrote songs. He was 6ft 7in, and people called him a gentle giant who would do anything for anybody.'

Detective Sergeant Mark Haworth-Oates, of Lancashire Constabulary’s Force Major Investigation Team, said: 'This was a particularly brutal and cowardly attack on a man who was posing no threat and who had no warning or opportunity to defend himself.

'McSorley stabbed Paul in a town centre street, busy with shoppers, in the middle of the day in an attack fuelled by the defendant’s jealousy.

'As the Judge stated in sentencing, the defendant has not shown an ounce of remorse and this is reflected in the sentence that has been imposed.

'The verdict and sentence will hopefully allow the family of Paul to begin to move on with their lives knowing that justice has been done and our thoughts remain with them and with Paul’s friends.'
