A couple have been fined £120 for taking their son out of school to go on holiday with his terminally-ill grandfather.

Trevor and Joanne Cannon asked for permission to take Alfie, 13, away for two weeks at the end of the summer term to go to Malta with grandfather George Mills.

Basildon Lower Academy allegedly said it was not a good enough reason, but the couple decided to go anyway as Mr Cannon is given allocated holiday dates and cannot change them.

Mr Cannon, a bus driver from Basildon, said: 'My father-in-law is terminally ill and we wanted to go to Malta as he loves it out there and we wanted to have a family holiday with him.'

Punished: Joanna and Trevor Cannon were fined £120 for taking their 13-year-old son Alfie out of school to go on holiday to Malta with his terminally-ill grandfather. They were told the circumstances were 'not exceptional'

He added: 'I've been fined and, fair enough, I'll pay the fine, that doesn't bother me, it is the principle.

'They sent us a letter saying it is not a good enough reason, but what is a good reason?

'I was told by someone if he was to die they would have allowed it, but if he had died we would not be going on a family holiday.

'Alfie is quite close to his nan and grandad.

'They spoil him rotten and he is always doing something with them and it might have been his last holiday with his grandad.

'I don't think it is very fair.

'It was all booked up and we were not going to lose all the money, so we decided to go and face the consequences afterwards. We got home and now Alfie's grandad is quite poorly.'

Mr and Mrs Cannon received two letters charging them £60 each last week.

Denied: Staff at Basildon Lower Academy allegedly said the grandfather's illness was not a good enough reason, but the couple decided to go anyway as Mr Cannon is given allocated holiday dates he cannot change

No one from the school was available to comment. 

A Department for Education spokesman said the decision about whether a case meets the exceptional circumstances requirement is taken by the headteacher.

He would not comment on whether this case should have met that criteria.

Headteachers no longer have the discretion to approve absences of up to 10 days a year for family holidays in 'special circumstances' because of new rules introduced in September 2013.

Tougher criteria of 'exceptional circumstances' restrict approved absences to events such as family funerals.
