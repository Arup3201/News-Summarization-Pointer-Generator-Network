A non-league football match had to be postponed after a groundsman demolished the goalposts while mowing and rolling the pitch. 

The groundsman was dragging a heavy roller around the goal-mouth part of the pitch at the home of Brokenhurst FC when the bulky contraption firmly struck the left-hand post. 

Such was the force of the collision it caused the goal frame to snap at the join of the crossbar, leaving it dismantled on the turf. 

Brockenhurst's home clash against Bournemouth Poppies was postponed when the groundsman demolished the goalposts with a heavy roller - the home team were unable to get replacement posts in time 

The damage to the goalposts was so bad it meant yesterday's Sydenhams Wessex League clash between Brockenhurst and Bournemouth Poppies had to be cancelled. 

Pete Lynes, chairman of Brockenhurst FC, told MailOnline: 'I heard about it on the day itself and at first I didn't believe it. 

'But when I went down I saw the damage to the post and I immediately telephoned the manufacturers to see if they would be able to provide replacements. 

'But they could not deliver new ones until the middle of next week, so we had to call the game off. It's just one of those things.' 

A spokesman for Bournemouth said: 'We are disappointed, especially after our midweek win, but it is one of those freak things that cannot be helped.'  

Brockenhurst's home pitch at Grigg Lane where the goalposts were uprooted by the groundsman 

Bournemouth Poppies had been hoping to emulate their mid-week success, when they defeated Andover Town 3-1. 

Their impressive form is in contrast to Brockenhurst who have lost their previous five matches - so the week off may have been a welcome relief. 

The mid-table clash has been rescheduled for Saturday, March 28.
