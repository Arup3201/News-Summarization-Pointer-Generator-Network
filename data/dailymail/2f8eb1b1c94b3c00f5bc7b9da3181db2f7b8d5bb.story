We have all heard of killer heels, but how about shuddery stilettos? Or pubescent pumps?

Chinese artist Zhu Tian has created a pair of hairy heels in the name of art, and the results are all kind of ewww.

The flesh-coloured shoes, ironically called 'Babe', feature pointed toes, spiked heels and patches of human hair attached to silica gel.

Would YOU wear these? The heels are tied up as part of an exhibition by Zhu Tian in China

Standing at more than four inches high walking in them might be a tall order, even if you could get over the stomach-churning sight of the tufty toes.

But the eye-catching shoes are not made for dancing the night away and are in fact designed to highlight how women's footwear is sexualised.

Tian, who was born in China but moved to the UK in 2002, implanted the individual hairs by hand before tying them together with chains and displaying them as a sculpture.

Height of fashion? The hairy shoes have been described as 'the stuff of nightmares'

The hairy shoes have been described as having a 'revolting appearance'

Design site Designboom.com describes the piece of work as 'strands of hair [that] have been carefully implanted into the foot-shaped form, loosely arranged to highlight their undoubtedly revolting appearance. 

'The explicit connotations are evident as the sculptural wearables seek to convey their primary function as sexual commodities and as tools to increase attractiveness and lust.'

The fash pack, though, are less impressed, withStyleite.com calling them 'the stuff of nightmares'.
