Newmarket trainer John Ryan can lay claims to one of the buys of the season with Tenor but has warned the winner of the Listed Fortune Stakes at Sandown will not take his chance in the prestigious Cambridgeshire Handicap if the ground turns soft.

The four-year-old son of Oratorio has now won six times this year and is a 16-1 shot for the Cambridgeshire at Ryan’s local track on Saturday week.

Tenor was previously with St Leger-winning trainer Roger Varian before being bought by Ryan at last season’s Tattersalls Horses-in-Training Sale for 16,000gns.

Ryan said: ‘He has been gelded and had a breathing operation and we have just given him time.

‘I am so pleased Roger has had a good season as we are good friends, otherwise he probably would not be talking to me now.

‘He's in the Cambridgeshire but the ground needs to remain good for him to run. If there's any soft in the going, he won't be going there.

‘He looks like a horse we could have fun with in Dubai.’

Tenor was one of three winners – a 57-1 treble - on the Sandown card for jockey Adam Kirby.

He also landed the opening Racehorse Sanctuary Remembers Moorcroft Boy Handicap on John Jenkins-trained Only Ten Per Cent, who carries the colours of soccer agent Barry Silkman.

In between Kirby executed a well-timed front-running ride on Charlie Appleby-trained Latharnach in the two-year-old Novices’ Stakes.

Kirby is a regular jockey for trainer Clive Cox but it was apprentice Ryan Tate who was on board Raise Your Gaze, his winner of the Support Racehorse Sanctuary Handicap.

Cox said his promising two-year-old Kodi Bear, a winner at Ascot in July, is on course for the Dewhurst Stakes at Newmarket on October 17.
