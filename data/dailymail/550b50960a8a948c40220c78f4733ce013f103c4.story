It's not often you see Olivier Giroud come to the rescue, but he was so effective in that second half against Everton.

I’m not sure Alexis Sanchez will work in that lone striker role just yet and Giroud did well when he came on.

It’s only his fourth goal against a top five side in the Premier League — two of the others also came against Everton and the fourth against Liverpool — and that is something he has to work on.

Physical presence: Arsenal immediately offered more going forward after the Frenchman's introduction

Ups and downs: Giroud held the ball up well for the Gunners but did miss a fine chance soon after coming on

No player has scored more headed goals in the Premier League since the beginning of last season than Giroud.

He needs to make more contributions in the big games, and that starts this week against Besiktas. 

With Aaron Ramsey suspended, Giroud will be a key player if they want to qualify for the Champions League.

But if he gets injured, Arsenal do look short on options up front.

RIGHT-BACKS ARE HAVING AN IMPACT

With Glen Johnson failing to impress at the World Cup and Kyle Walker not progressing quickly enough, Roy Hodgson will hope someone can make the England right back spot their own.

The good news is that with Calum Chambers, John Stones and Eric Dier, there are some exciting young players making their mark.

The thing I like about all three is they are comfortable on the ball — something that’s so important in the modern game — and they are versatile.

On the scoresheet again: Dier has scored in each of Tottenham's Premier League games so far this campaign

I was at White Hart Lane on Sunday and I was very impressed by Dier. Yes, he has scored two good goals in two matches, but it’s his all-round game that is making him stand out.

2 - In just two appearances for Mauricio Pochettino's side Dier has scored more goals than any Spurs defender did in the whole of 2013-14. 

He looks a good athlete and is clearly happy playing in a variety of positions. His dad was a tennis player so he’s got a good sporting background and Tim Henman, who knows the family, says Eric is not your average footballer — he is polite and a well-rounded young man.

He’s made an excellent start but — and there’s always a ‘but’ with young players — we’ll find out a lot more about him if he faces the likes of Daniel Sturridge and Raheem Sterling against Liverpool next Sunday. 

ALLARDYCE'S RAID ON THE PALACE

After all the drama of last season, Sam Allardyce will be pleased with how his team has started this one. He talks about how much pressure he is under but if they keep producing performances like Saturday’s, that pressure will disappear. 

His side were unlucky not to get something at home to Spurs on the opening weekend and were excellent against Palace. They did to Palace what Palace did to other teams last year under Tony Pulis — beat them with good, efficient football. As for the home team, after all the chaos of last week, they looked rudderless. 

They need to get a manager in there as soon as possible to take charge. Palace lost nine of their first 10 fixtures last season. If they’re not careful and don’t get a new man in soon, they could beat that record and lose their first 10.

Looking up: West Ham's impressive win against Crystal Palace has helped ease pressure on Sam Allardyce

NAISMITH THE UNSUNG HERO 

Much has been made of Everton’s big-name players, but Steven Naismith is now a real unsung hero. Roberto Martinez started Romelu Lukaku on the right side, which left Naismith room to pop up in the middle. 

Naismith has been involved in seven goals in his last 10 Premier League appearances for Everton. He has scored five and assisted two during that time. 

He is now a master of finding himself in the right place at the right time, and he scored another good goal against Arsenal on Saturday. He was fortunate with the offside call, but it was a clever run and he finished his chance well, slotting the ball through Wojciech Szczesny’s legs. 

He is now one of Everton’s most valuable assets.

Deserves credit: Everton attacker Steven Naismith has started the new season just how he finished the last

UNITED LACK A CUTTING EDGE

Another week and another disappointing Man United performance. You can see why they are desperate for the Angel di Maria signing to go through. When I played United you were almost more scared on the ball because if you lost it they would be all over you in seconds. 

This side just lack pace. Di Maria can help but I’m interested to see where he will fit in with Louis van Gaal’s 3-5-2 system. When a player like Di Maria becomes available, it’s no wonder United go after him. But it’s plain to see he is the signing they least need to make. 

Their priority has to be a defender and a deep-lying midfielder to dictate the play.

Imminent arrival: Angel Di Maria is set to join Manchester United from Real Madrid in a move worth £65million

IT'S GROUNDHOG DAY AT FULHAM

Fulham were a farce last season, when they went through three managers in as many months.  But the way things are going, with three straight losses in the Championship, they could go through another three this time round.
