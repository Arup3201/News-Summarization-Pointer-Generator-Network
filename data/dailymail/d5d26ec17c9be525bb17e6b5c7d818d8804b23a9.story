Postpartum depression is a serious condition affecting women who have recently given birth.

But New York theatre scion Eric Nederlander claimed he, too, suffered the baby blues after the birth of his daughter Mira, with his then-wife Lindsey Kupferman, court documents show.

After the birth, he demonstrated a string of violent, erratic behaviour, allegedly threatening to smash his wife’s face in and ripping up their baby’s birth announcements after a lengthy fight over credit card bills.

Court documents obtained by Page Six magazine detailed Nederlander’s post-baby blues, noting that the couple fought constantly.

After ripping up the baby announcements, Nederlander, 46, wrote an email to Ms Kupferman explaining his actions, adding ‘male postpartum depression is probably something I’m going through,’ Page Six reports.

He and Ms Kupferman divorced just seven weeks after she gave birth to their daughter.

The string of alleged violence doesn’t stop there. Nederlander – better known as the first Mr Jessica Seinfeld - was arrested in January for allegedly smashing his current girlfriend Nancy Okun’s face into the Plexiglas divider of a taxi cab, the magazine notes.

However, the idea that postpartum depression affects fathers too has taken root in some parts of the medical community.

Dr Will Courtenay, known as ‘The Men’s Doc,’ is a psychotherapist who claims that as many as one in four new fathers suffer from the condition.

He told USA Today that signs of the disease don’t manifest in men the same way as they do in mothers. Instead of becoming weepy or lethargic, Dr Courtenay noted that ‘it can look more like irritability, anger, working constantly, or drinking and gambling too much.’

And there is medical information to back him up. In a 2010 study published in the Journal of the American Medical Association, up to 14.1 per cent of new dads in the U.S. were diagnosed with the disease.

Nederlander’s infamous marriage to Jessica Seinfeld (nee Sklar) ended in only three weeks, after she met Jerry Seinfeld at the gym. The newlyweds had just returned from their honeymoon in Italy.

Seinfeld, star of the popular NBC sitcom of the same name, married Sklar on Christmas Day in 1999, and the two are still together.

Ms Okun, 31, told police in January that Nederlander yanked her hair while she was sleeping and said: ‘You’re cheating on me,’ after allegedly looking at her cell phone.

A police source told the Post that the 31-year-old felt in 'fear for her own safety'. 

Nederlander's lawyer Evan Lipton said there was no claim the woman was physically injured and there were 'serious issues undermining the complainant’s credibility'.

The most recent incident has the 46-year-old charged with criminal contempt, a felony that carries up to four years in prison.

He will next appear in court on April 6.
