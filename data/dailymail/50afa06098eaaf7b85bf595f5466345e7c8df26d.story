Former Republican presidential nominee Mitt Romney dished about an awkward encounter with a masseuse during the 2012 campaign while appearing on the inaugural installment of Bloomberg Television show With All Due Respect on Monday evening.

Asked by co-host Mark Halperin what his 'single weirdest experience' as a presidential candidate was, Romney revealed that after shaking too many hands at an event in San Francisco, California, once, 'I began to get kind of a kink in my back.

'And so I asked ... the guy who traveled with me...I said, "Can you find someone to get me a back massage at the hotel tonight?" 

Not running: Former Republican presidential nominee Mitt Romney reiterated on Monday that he's not planning to pursue the presidency for a third time in 2016

'And he got a massage therapist, I think, from the Ritz-Carlton to come over and come in our room,' Romney said.

'And so he sat there to make sure that we had two people there at all times. And she gave me a massage. And she was Hispanic American. 

'And after I left to go get changed and showered and so forth, she turned to him and she said, "Is he a dancer?" '

Romney told Halperin and With All Due Respect's other co-host John Heilemann, 'That was the best compliment I have ever had.' 

The former Massachusetts governor went on to explain that the woman thought he was a dancer because, as she said, ' "He has strong legs." '

'They're bird legs, actually, but she thought they were strong,' he said, laughing.

The interview with Romney was nearly as awkward as his experience with the masseuse, with Halperin asking for his thoughts on Downtown Abbey in the post-Matthew Crawley age and potential image problems for the Crawley family's dog, whose name is, coincidentally, Isis.

At the end of the show the Halperin and Heilemann showed Romney a family portrait and asked him to name all 21 of his grandchildren. After realizing half way through that Romney, 67, does in fact know and recognize the offspring of his five sons, Haperin begged him to stop.

Romney also dished on his 'single weirdest experience' on the campaign trail, explaining it involved a masseuse who thought he was a dancer because he has 'strong legs'

The interview wasn't all fluff, with the trio taking a few minutes to discuss President Barack Obama's decision not to leave a limited number of troops behind in Iraq after the U.S. handed control of the country back to the Iraqi people - Romney thinks he should have - and whether foreign policy will be a voting issue in November - Romney says it will.

Halperin and Heilemann didn't let Romney leave the set without commenting on his much talked about 2016 comeback campaign, which the retired Republican politician assured them it is not in the cards.

Commenting on his wife's suggestion last month that her husband's potential candidacy would hinge on former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush's plans, Romney called Bush 'an excellent person' and said he 'could be a terrific president.'

'I think that about a lot of the people who are running on the Republican side,' he added. 'My guess is you're gonna see 15 or so people on the stage at the first debate.

'Among those people we're gonna find someone who catches fire, who ignites the interests of the Republican base, and you're gonna see someone who can go on to become president.'

Heilemann noted that Romney has left the 'door open' for another run during an interview in late August when he claimed that 'circumstances change.' 

'And then I went on to say, I'm not letting my head go there, where I'm focused on making sure we nominate the right person, who cares about the kinds of issues I care about,' Romney replied, trying yet again to tamp down expectations for his political career.

Romney said he would be looking to endorse someone in 2016 who cares about foreign policy, economy and the 'looming issue of poverty,' which he said in an important issue 'that's not being addressed.
