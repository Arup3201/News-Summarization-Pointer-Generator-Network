Avram Grant is set to be confirmed as the new manager of Ghana on a two-year deal.

Grant, the former Chelsea and West Ham manager, will reportedly land a hefty signing-on fee in the region of £130,000, in addition to £30,000-a-month wages.

His agreement to take over at the Black Stars, who have been without a permanent manager following Kwesi Appiah’s departure in April, was in doubt over his nationality.

The Israeli could be refused access to some Northern African countries, but Ghana FA president Kwesi Nyantekyie believes the issue will be resolved. 

‘The holder of an Israeli passport will not only be denied entry into North African countries, he will be denied into some Arab countries,’ Nyantekyie told BBC Sport.

‘He has brought an alternative way of dealing with it. There is a satisfactory arrangement to arrest his threat. Very soon, in a matter of months, we should clear that.’

Grant lead Chelsea to the Champions League final in Moscow in 2008 where they lost to Manchester United

Nyantekyie, who claimed an agreement will be in place for Grant to take over after Ghana’s match against Togo on Wednesday, added: ‘He is a motivator. He has the capacity and skill to manage egos and top players and these are some of the challenges that the Black Stars team is going through.

‘He has the strength, he has a strong mentality. He feels in Africa most of the players lack the passion or the mentality even though they have the skill. We hope he will be able to instil these qualities so that we will win trophies.’

Grant will lead Ghana in the Africa Cup of Nations in January 

Grant, 59, took Chelsea to the Champions League final in 2008, where they lost to Manchester United, and also managed the Israel national team for four years. He will be charged with winning Ghana their fifth Africa Cup of Nations title in January.

Former Netherlands striker Patrick Kluivert, ex-German international Bernd Schuster and Italian Marco Tardelli were also shortlisted for the job but were never interviewed for different reasons.
