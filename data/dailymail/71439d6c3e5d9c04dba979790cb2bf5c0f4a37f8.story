Kei Nishikori returned to Grand Slam action for the first time since his run to the US Open final, beating Nicolas Almagro  in the first round of the Australian Open.

The fifth-seeded Nishikori dropped his opening service game but recovered the break quickly and weathered a difficult opening match against Almagro , who reached the quarter-finals in his previous visit to Melbourne Park in 2013.

But Nishikori was too strong for his opponent and eventually progressed to the second round 6-4, 7-6, 6-2.

After a breakthrough season, when he became the first Asian man to reach a Grand Slam singles final, Nishikori is determined to go one better and win a major.

'Yeah for sure that was one of my best results in my career that gave me a lot of confidence,' the Japanese star said. 'I beat a lot of top 10 players.'
