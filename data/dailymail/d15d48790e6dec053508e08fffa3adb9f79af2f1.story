Fan? Borat star Sacha Baron Cohen was spotted watching Grimsby Town

Borat star Sacha Baron Cohen was pictured attending a Grimsby match last October and now MailOnline is able to reveal why he was a Mariner for the day.

Cohen is to play an idiotic Grimsby Town hooligan in his next film.

Baron Cohen, 42, sat at Blundell Park as a supporter to 
see the Mariners get beat 1-0 by 
Cambridge United earlier this season.

And he was pictured by a fan in a nearby hotel after the game as he mingled with the locals.

Cohen delighted with tales about his career and made a lasting mark.

Barwoman Rosetta Stiles told the Grimsby Telegraph: 'He was a really nice guy. He was really down to earth and was chatting away to all the supporters.'

It may have been a bit more than a casual visit though.

Cohen
 is reported as being involved in a new film centred on life in northern
 England with Hollywood screenwriter Phil Johnston.

Johnston has also visited Scunthorpe,
 Hull and Newcastle to find inspiration, while Cohen is said to have 
been with two others filming Grimsby supporters.

The movie will be called 'Grimsby', with a number of scenes to be shot in the ­Lincolnshire town.

Last
 week it was revealed the plot ­involves Mark Strong playing a James 
Bond-style covert ops agent forced to go on the run with his ­estranged 
brother – who happens to be a football hooligan.

Annabelle Wallis, who starred in TV's Peaky Blinders, plays Sacha’s girlfriend.

Film
 bosses first began turning up in the port last August before Baron 
Cohen arrived to take a tour of The Grimsby Fish Company, a fish 
merchant that has been operating for 60 years.

Boss
 Jody Douglass told the Star On Sunday reporter David Paul: 'He was a 
very nice guy. It was a surprise when he arrived, we were just getting 
ready to cash up.

'I’m a big fan but he was coy about why he was filming and just said he was not ­allowed to tell.

'He
 started to ask a lot of questions. I’m a big fan but he was coy about 
why he was filming and just said he was not ­allowed to tell.

'We
 were not allowed to take photos because he said he did not like photos 
unless he was in character. "He asked ­permission to film throughout the
 b­usiness and in the cold store.

'He said he wanted to buy some fish – but he also wanted me to cook it for him.'
