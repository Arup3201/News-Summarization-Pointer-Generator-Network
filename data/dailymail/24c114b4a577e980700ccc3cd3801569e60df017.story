The Obama administration has hit out at Britain for developing closer ties with China after the UK applied to join a new $50billion Asian bank.

Britain wants to become a founding member of a proposed Chinese-led financial institution that analysts say could rival the World Bank.

But in a rare slapdown, the US administration  has criticised one of its closest allies for its 'constant accommodation' of China.

Downing Street yesterday acknowledged the rift, saying: 'There will be times when we take a different approach (to the US).' 

The British Treasury said on Thursday that it will join talks this month on the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank's structure and governance arrangements.

China proposed the bank in 2013 to finance construction of roads and other infrastructure. It has pledged to put up most of its initial $50billion in capital.

But the Financial Times has quoted a US administration source as saying Britain took its decision after showing 'virtually no consultation with the US' and as G7 was still discussing how to approach the new bank.

The source said: 'We are wary about a trend toward constant accommodation of China, which is not the best way to engage a rising power.'

The Financial Times reports that the comments are an apparent breach of the 'special relationship' between Britain and America.

It reports that relations between David Cameron's government and Washington were already strained amid concerns over the level of Britain's defence spending.

The Prime Minister's official spokesman said the deal was in Britain's 'national interest' and Sir Christopher Hum, a former British ambassador to China, said there were direct benefits potentially for British industry.'

The Obama administration has expressed concern the new Asian bank could undercut the World Bank and International Monetary Fund

He said the new bank, which will provide funding for infrastructure projects across Asia, would enable British firms to invest in a string of massive schemes. 

But Dr Pippa Malmgren, a former adviser to George W Bush, said the US is concerned the bank could be used to further China’s bid to become the world’s leading superpower. There are also fears in Washington that David Cameron’s drive to boost exports and growth is making Britain blind to the risks of dealing with China.

In a statement yesterday, the White House said it was concerned about whether the new bank would meet ‘environmental and social safeguards’, adding pointedly: ‘This is the UK’s sovereign decision. We hope and expect that the UK will use its voice to push for adoption of high standards.’

But a senior official went further, telling the Financial Times that the deal appeared to be part of a trend towards ‘constant accommodation’ of China by the UK.

Twenty-one other governments including India, New Zealand and Thailand have said they want to join the new bank. 

For now, the United States and its close allies Japan, South Korea and Australia are not part of the new club.

The bank is one of a series of initiatives by Beijing to increase its influence in global finance and expand trade links with its Asian neighbors and developing countries in Africa and Latin America.

Although Obama's administration has said it is not opposed to the new bank, Washington has expressed concern that it will allow looser lending standards for the environment, labour rights and financial transparency, undercutting the World Bank and International Monetary Fund.

China is the top trading partner for most of its neighbors. They want to promote commercial ties but are uneasy about Beijing's strategic ambitions, especially at a time when it is embroiled in territorial disputes with Japan in the East China Sea and with Vietnam and other Southeast Asian neighbors in the South China Sea.

Beijing has tried to soothe security concerns, insisting its initiatives are not aimed at any potential foreign rival.

'The initiatives are not China's solo, but a symphony performed by all relevant countries,' said Foreign Minister Wang Yi this week, according to Chinese state television.

The British Treasury's announcement said it would try to ensure the Asian bank 'embodies the best standards in accountability, transparency and governance.'

Chancellor George Osborne said in a statement that joining will help Britain promote commercial ties with Asia.

'This government has actively promoted closer political and economic engagement with the Asia-Pacific region and forging links between the UK and Asian economies to give our companies the best opportunity to work and invest in the world’s fastest growing markets is a key part of our long term economic plan. 

'Joining the AIIB at the founding stage will create an unrivalled opportunity for the UK and Asia to invest and grow together,' Mr Osborne said.

According to the Financial Times, the UK Treasury has denied Britain made the decision out of the blue insisting there was 'at least a month of extensive consultation' at G7 level. The newspaper says US Treasury secretary Jack Lew was involved in these discussions.

Britain's announcement was not welcomed in Washington last night.

A spokesman for the White House National Security Council said: 'It is important to note that countries that become
prospective members of the AIIB will be responsible for the
standards adopted in the articles of agreement and their
implementation.

'This is the UK's sovereign decision. We hope and expect
that the UK will use its voice to push for adoption of high
standards,' he said.

China's Ministry of Finance said it welcomed Britain's 
decision, and would consult with the AIIB's existing founding
members on its proposed entry.

'If all goes well, the UK will become a founding member of
the AIIB by the end of March,' it said in a statement on its
website. 

Other governments joining the bank include Singapore, Vietnam, the Philippines, Mongolia, Laos, Cambodia, Oman, Uzbekistan, Sri Lanka, Qatar, Pakistan, Nepal, Bangladesh, Brunei, Kazakhstan, Kuwait, Malaysia and Myanmar.

In May, Chinese President Xi Jinping called for the creation of a new Asian structure for security cooperation based on a 24-nation group that excludes the United States. 

This morning, it was reported that president of the World Bank welcomed the setting up of the AIIB, a day after Britain
became the first Western nation to embrace the institution.

With US interest rates likely to rise later this year,
capital flows to emerging markets and low-income countries will
face greater challenges over time, Jim Yong Kim told a news
conference.

'From the perspective simply of the need for more
infrastructure spending, there's no doubt that from our
perspective, we welcome the entry of the Asian Infrastructure
Investment Bank,' he said. 

'As the U.K. just announced today in their statement, they
were very clear in saying that they were going to insist that
the standards of any new bank that they are part of would be
equal to the World Bank and the Asian Development Bank,' Kim added. 

China said earlier this year a total of 26 countries are
founder members, mostly from Asia and the Middle East.

'Generally speaking, the international reaction has been
positive,' Chinese foreign ministry spokesman Hong Lei said in
Beijing.

'The AIIB will abide by the principles of openness,
inclusivity, transparency, responsibility and equality ... and
fully reference the good practices of multilateral banks to
avoid some of the detours they have taken,' he added.

While Hong did not respond directly to U.S. concerns about
the bank, China's official Xinhua news agency took a stronger
line.

'The response of the US government exhibited nothing but a
childish paranoia towards China,' it said in an English-language
commentary, slamming what it called 'reflective scepticism'.
