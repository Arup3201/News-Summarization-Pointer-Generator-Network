Members of the RMT union plan to walk out for 48 hours from 9pm today and for three days from the same time next Monday in a row over ticket office closures.

Passengers have been warned to expect disruption on the Tube and other types of public transport in the capital.

Action: Tube bosses will today hold last-ditch talks aimed at averting strikes by London Underground workers

Meetings were held last week but failed to break the deadlock, with the union sticking to its opposition to the closures and the loss of jobs.

London Underground says that only 3 per cent of tickets are sold at ticket offices, and that staff would be better employed on station concourses.

Managing director Mike Brown said: 'The RMT leadership are making this up on the hoof. Suddenly, they want 
to unilaterally tear up the long-established and collectively agreed 
option of voluntary redundancy, throwing into question the plans of over
 650 staff who have chosen to leave us.

'The RMT leadership has also failed to take on board the significant changes we have made to our original proposals.

Standing firm: LU managing director Mike Brown said members of the RMT union should 'call off the strike and save commuters and businesses from disruption'. He added: 'We will not be diverted from doing the right thing'

'They should clearly now call off the strike and save London’s commuters and businesses from disruption.

'We
 will not be diverted from doing the right thing. No responsible 
management can stand by and force customers to pay £50 million a year 
for services which can be delivered far better and while keeping fares 
down.'

But Mick Cash, acting general secretary of the RMT, said: 'RMT is committed to the talks process and we will be available tomorrow as I have made clear to Tube boss Mike Brown.

'It is essential that the promise we were given for a full line-by-line and station-by-station review of the cuts and closures, and their impact on staff, passengers and safety, is carried out and that the cuts are halted to allow that process to take place without a gun at our members’ heads.

'This dispute is solely about cash-led cuts to jobs and services that would decimate Tube safety.'

LU claimed the RMT was demanding the withdrawal of long-standing voluntary redundancy arrangements.

It added that said the modernisation of the Tube will mean more staff visible and available to customers than ever before in the public areas of stations - offering on a permanent basis the levels of customer service provided during the London 2012 Games.
