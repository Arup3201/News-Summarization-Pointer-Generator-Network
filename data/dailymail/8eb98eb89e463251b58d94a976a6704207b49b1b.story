Portugal has the highest percentage of female millionaires in the world, a report has found.

Women make up less than a quarter of the country's fat cats (23 per cent), but it's still way above the Netherlands, which boasts only 5.9 per cent.

While Britain fares better than some, with 11.4 per cent of UK millionaires being female, it 
still comes in behind countries such as Thailand, Spain, Italy and 
Singapore.

Portugal has the highest percentage of female millionaires compared to men - 23 per cent

The USA is revealed to have just 9.4 per cent, Canada 9.2 per cent, Australia 8.8 per cent, while France has 8.5 per cent.

The league table, compiled by Spears Magazine and wealth consultancy company WealthInsight, 
shines a light on gender inequality in terms of individual wealth.

Liberal countries, such as the Belgium 
6 per cent, Netherlands 5.9 per cent and New Zealand on 6.3 per cent, fare surprisingly badly.

Saudi Arabia and Japan take the two bottom places, with 3.8 per cent and on 3.7 per cent respectively.

Portugal - 23.8 per cent

Philippines - 21.0 per cent

Peru - 18.3 per cent

Hong Kong - 18.0 per cent

Turkey - 17.4 per cent

Netherlands - 5.9 per cent

Russia - 5.7 per cent

Mexico - 5.3 per cent

Saudi Arabia - 3.8 per cent

Japan - 3.7 per cent

Josh Spero, editor of SPEAR's magazine, says: 'The top ten most equal countries for multimillionaires are a diverse bunch and almost certainly not the ones you would have predicted.

'It certainly seems that Asia is leading the way in gender equality, perhaps reflecting emerging markets whose developing, increasingly wealthy economies are not bound by old forms of gender discrimination in business.'

He adds: 'There are also surprises about the least equal countries for multimillionaires, although some are obvious: In Saudi Arabia, women can only work in jobs which don't bring them into contact with men, which obviously stifles economic opportunity.

'Countries like the Netherlands, Belgium and New Zealand we might well assume had a fairer distribution of wealth with their liberal politics and diversified economies, so it is surprising to find otherwise.

'It is worth remembering, of course, that women make up over half the global population, so we can't really say any country is gender-equal until its wealth is divided much more along those lines. What is shocking is that no country is anywhere near that yet.'

According to Oliver Williams of WealthInsight: 'There seems to be no correlation between emerging and developed countries in the top 10 female multimillionaire countries.

'However, if you consider that Hong Kong and Singapore are home to many of emerging Asia's multimillionaires, it appears that most of the top 10 countries are in fact emerging markets. This is a startling realisation when you think that it is Western countries leading the way in promoting gender equality.'

The research also shows that the UK sits 15th in the world and 10th in Europe in terms of its percentage of female multimillionaires (11.4 per cent).

Spero adds: ' According to the Harvard Business Review, female entrepreneurs make 20 per cent more revenue with 50 per cent less investment, so helping women into business is good for us all.'
