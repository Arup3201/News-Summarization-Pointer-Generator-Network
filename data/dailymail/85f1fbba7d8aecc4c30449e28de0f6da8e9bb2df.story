Sentenced: Alain Bhatupa was jailed yesterday for sexually assaulting two women who visited him for help

A self-proclaimed spiritual healer who targeted devout Christians was jailed yesterday for sexually assaulting two women who visited him for help.

Alain Bhatupa, 37, called himself ‘The Prophet Alain’ during appearances on a satellite television channel which he used as a platform to peddle his bogus healing techniques.

A court heard two women approached him at his television station office after watching him promoting healing during his regular slot on the religious Wonderful TV channel.

Bhatupa was jailed for nine years yesterday at Harrow Crown Court in North London, almost a month after he was convicted of five counts of sexual assault.

Metropolitan Police officers began their investigation last August when the first victim, aged 61, reported that Bhatupa had molested her when she approached him at the office off the North Circular Rd in North London for treatment for severe back pain.

The pervert examined her, sexually assaulted her, then asked for a financial ‘offering’ amounting to more than £500.

In early September, a second victim, aged 40, reported to police that she had visited Bhatupa the previous month for treatment for an inflamed foot.

She was also assaulted and asked to make a £600 ‘offering’.

Both victims had seen Bhatupa, of 
Upper Edmonton, North London, performing ‘spiritual healings’ on 
television and had arranged appointments with him in good faith 
believing that he would help them overcome their conditions.

Police
raided the Congolese ‘healer’s two business addresses and seized 
telephone records, medical swabs and CCTV which linked the victims to 
the bogus prophet and Bhatupa.

On his website, Bhatupa claims to be the leader of the ‘International Prophetic and Teaching Ministries in the name of Jesus Christ’.

He describes himself as ‘Prophet Archbishop Alain’ and said he appeared four times a week in TV ministry on the African TV channel, which stopped broadcasting earlier this year..

Detective Sergeant Peter Walker, from the Met’s Sapphire unit which specialises in investigating rape and sexual assault cases, said Bhatupa used the televisions station to target ‘devout Christian viewers’.

Det Sgt Walker added: ‘He used his position of trust and his television credibility to go on and sexually assault women behind closed doors. It is possible that there are further victims who have been affected by the actions of Bhatupa, and I urge them to come forward and speak to us.

‘The Met takes all matters of rape and sexual assault seriously no matter what the circumstances are, no matter when the crime was committed.

Together with our partners we will ensure that victims receive the maximum support possible and be treated with the utmost respect and dignity.’

Bhatupa’s arrest came 18 months after he was cleared of similar offences after a trial at Inner London Crown Court.

In that case, a jury were told the Bhatupa, who was described in court as a pastor, had assaulted three women members of his flock after promising to purge them of their demons.

He was cleared of two indecent assaults, two counts of assault by penetration and one of exposure, after claiming to be the victim of a malicious campaign by the ex-husband of a woman he was dating.
