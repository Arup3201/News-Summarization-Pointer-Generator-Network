England suffered a hat-trick of heartbreaks after defeat to Jamaica denied them Commonwealth Games bronze.

A day after blowing their chances of making the gold medal match for the first time in the dying seconds against New Zealand, Anna Mayes' side went down 52-48 at the SSE Hydro to miss out on a medal.

This match also looked set to go to the wire with the scores level at 37-37 going into the final quarter, but England's level dropped when it mattered most as they slipped from 48-47 behind to 51-47 down and from that point there was no way back.

Ecstatic: Jamaica's netball team celebrate beating England in their Commonwealth Games bronze match

At least there was no individual mistake in the final seconds to look back on, as there had been against the Silver Ferns and, in the pool stage, against Australia.

Both of those matches were lost by a single point. This time England, bronze medallists at the last two Commonwealths, were just not good enough.

Kadeen Corbin, whose error proved so costly against New Zealand, responded with 22 goals from 26 attempts, while Jo Harten scored 26 from 29, but it was Romelda Aiken's 44 from 52 for Jamaica, including 15 in the final quarter, which proved invaluable.

'Today we didn't bring it,' said goalkeeper Geva Mentor, who was left battered and bruised by a physical contest.

'Jamaica were the best team on the day, they held strong all the way through and withstood the pressure we kept applying, but we didn't capitalise when we did get that ball.

'It was very physical, you can tell that from my fat lip and I've got a shiner coming up as well. It's a shame the umpires can't see the retaliation, but we just have to withstand that. We have to be quick enough and skilful enough to be able to lose the body so we don't get caught in the face.

'Yesterday's was definitely (harder to swallow). I'm not even upset, I think it just sums up this tournament for me. Anger will probably start to set in and a few different emotions, but at the moment I am pretty emotionless.'

Jamaican were well-beaten 57-42 in their semi-final by the Australia team England ran so close, but made changes for Sunday's clash and they worked.

England led 13-11 after the first quarter, trailed 25-24 at halfway and were back level at the end of the third period as the momentum swung from one side to the other.

That run of three unanswered goals in the final period left England with too much to do, though, and had the Jamaican substitutes celebrating at the side of the court as the clock counted down.

Mayes said: 'I think we were a little bit tentative, a little bit nervous, especially in that first half. We did wear them down defensively, but we just weren't clinical enough when we needed to be.

'They fed Romelda well, they converted when they needed to and she rebounded well when she missed, so that was difficult.'

Australia ended New Zealand's reign as Commonwealth champions by claiming gold with a convincing 58-40 win in the final.
