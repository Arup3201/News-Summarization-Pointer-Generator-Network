Midfielder Adam Lallana insists he never forced an exit from Southampton before moving to Liverpool in the summer.

After a hugely impressive season with the Saints in the Premier League last term, Lallana secured a £25million move to Anfield, and joined Rickie Lambert and Dejan Lovren in moving from the south coast to Merseyside.

Lallana is now a full England international, seen here in training ahead of the Euro 2016 qualifiers

But the 26-year-old left on bad terms, with suggestions he had threatened not to play for Southampton if they didn't allow him to move.

This, Lallana says, is not true.

'I didn't say I'd never play for the club again. That's completely false,' Lallana said.

'Once I knew of Liverpool's interest, I asked the club if they could come to an agreement and that it would be my wish to leave and join Liverpool. I'll make no secret of that. I'm an ambitious person.'

Lallana has endured a tough start to his Liverpool career, missing the opening stages of the season through injury. 

But he scored his first goal for the club on Saturday in the 2-1 win over West Brom and things are finally looking up. 

Lallana had a superb season for Southampton last year, earning him interest from the upper echelons

He says he couldn't have turned down a move to the historic club to play under Brendan Rodgers.

'I could have stayed at Southampton until I retired. But at the age I was at, and with the opportunity I had, I couldn't have turned it down. I would have regretted it at the end of my career if I had.

'That leaves people disappointed. Saints fans. But I hope that, in time, they will enjoy the memories we had down there and the successes we had in such a short space of time.

'It was a difficult decision, but it's such an historic club. The manager was a big influence, the way he played his football. Champions League football is another level where you want to be playing and testing yourself.'
