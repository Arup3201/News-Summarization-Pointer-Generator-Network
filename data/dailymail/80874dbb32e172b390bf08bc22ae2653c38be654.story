Bankrupt: Tom McFeely, who used to live in the home in Ballsbridge, Dublin, is a former IRA hunger striker

Police today finished searching the former home of Priory Hall developer Tom McFeely following the discovery of more than €200,000 under floorboards.

Officers from the Criminal Assets Bureau combed the gardens and interior of the IRA hunger striker’s former mansion on Ailesbury Road in South Dublin after an initial discovery of €140,000 (£117,652) last week.

The money was found under a bath by a plumber carrying out renovation work on the house which was seized from the failed developer by the National Assets Management Agency.

Detectives discovered an additional €60,000 (£50,435) in the same area of the luxury home when they searched the premises two days ago.

Taoiseach Enda Kenny today said the discovery ‘smacks’ of the ‘prolificacy and greed’ of the Celtic Tiger years.

‘I understand that an inch by inch survey or investigation is being carried out both on this residence and on the grounds of the premises to see if there is any more there,’ Mr Kenny said.

He added: ‘I think all of that smacks 
of what happened during the so called Tiger Years when you had 
prolificacy and greed and money sloshing around in so many places, this 
is further evidence of what happened.

Nama have a clear interest in this and we’ll see what transpires from the investigation, which is currently underway.’

The
 money was found in €50 (£42) notes bound in elastic bands and hidden in 
plastic bags under the bath in the Ailesbury Road mansion called 
Coolbawn.

The search 
continued today in the garden, garage and a number of rooms of the 
redbrick luxury home but Gardai are now satisfied there is no more 
hidden money on the grounds.

Detectives removed bags of evidence from inside the house for examination before finishing the search.

No one has claimed the money since the discovery was reported and Gardai have yet to question McFeely.

CAB today said it found no documentation relating to the ownership of the money, according to RTE News.

Detectives are currently trying to establish the history of the notes through serial numbers and finger print tests.

The
 money will be placed in a bank account controlled by an appointee of 
the High Court who was assigned to oversee McFeely’s assets after he was
 declared bankrupt.

McFeely,
 who has debts of around €200million (£168million), told the courts last year he had 
less than €1,200 (£1,010) in the bank following his bankruptcy.

Probe: Detectives were satisfied that an extensive examination of the vast house in Ballsbridge, Dublin - including lifting floorbeds and pulling down partition walls - had found all the cash hidden inside

Discovery: The money will remain in a bank account under the control of an official assignee appointed by the High Court until a legitimate owner has been identified

The
 Priory Hall developer’s failure to adhere to proper building 
regulations when constructing the North Dublin apartment block 
effectively left 180 people homeless when the property was deemed a fire
 hazard.

'I
 think all of that smacks of what happened during the so-called Tiger 
years, when you had profligacy and greed and money sloshing around in so
 many places, that this is further evidence of what happened'

Former resident 
Stephanie Meehan said the stress of repaying the mortgage on their 
Priory Hall apartment led to her husband Fiachra Kelly taking his own 
life.

McFeely’s former 
mansion, which once housed the German Embassy, was worth €15million (£12.6million) but 
was sold earlier this year for €3milllion (£2.5million).

The luxury home was bought by Hilary Hynes, the wife of PR adviser and former Irish editor of The Sunday Times, Rory Godson.

The new owners requested the renovation works that led to the discovery of cash last week.

Builders
 working at other addresses on the exclusive South Dublin road today said they did not know who had carried out the renovation work for Ms 
Hynes.

McFeely, who served 
12 years in the Maze Prison in Northern Ireland for shooting an RUC 
officer, made a €8.5million (£7.2million) settlement with CAB seven years ago.

The
 portly property developer spent 53 days on hunger strike while 
imprisoned in the 1980s. The Derry native and former republican failed 
in his attempt to declare himself bankrupt in the UK.

His Dublin home was repossessed by Nama when he was eventually declared bankrupt in Ireland last year.

He
 avoided going back behind bars last July after successfully overturning
 a contempt of court judgment. The developer appealed a judgment that he
 broke court orders.

He had 
been ordered by the High Court in Dublin to carry out remedial works at 
Priory Hall, but was sentenced and fined when he did not.

Barristers
 for McFeely appealed it was impossible for their client to comply with 
orders because he had been evicted from the site.

Demonstration: IRA prisoners went on hunger strike in Northern Ireland's Maze prison in 1980

Tom McFeely was one of seven prisoners to spend 53 days on hunger strike in Northern Ireland's Maze jail in 1980. They were seeking the reinstatement of political prisoner status.

IRA fighter Bobby Sands died in the prison in 1981 after refusing food and water for 66 days.

Photographs of him emaciated and on the brink of death have become synonymous with the Republican movement's struggle.

Mr Sands's death drew massive worldwide publicity and resulted in him becoming a martyr to the IRA. Poems he wrote while in prison heightened his appeal.

His opponents, however, complain that by glorifying Mr Sands's determination his supporters overlook the fact that he had a lengthy criminal record and that he was part of a movement that killed hundreds of innocent people.

Mr Sands's hunger strike was dramatised in Hunger, the debut film in 2008 by Turner Prize-winning artist Steve McQueen starring Michael Fassbender.
