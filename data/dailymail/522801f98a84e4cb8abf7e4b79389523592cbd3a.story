Attorneys representing the husband of a pregnant, brain-dead Texas woman being kept on life support despite his protests is carrying a fetus that is 'distinctly abnormal' after being deprived of oxygen for an unknown period of time.

Marlise Munoz remains hooked up to machines in a Fort Worth hospital, while her husband and the hospital are locked in a court battle about whether to retain life support.

The case has raised questions about end-of-life care and whether a pregnant woman who is considered legally and medically dead should be kept on life support for the sake of a fetus. The case has gotten the attention of groups on either side of the abortion debate, as anti-abortion groups argue Munoz's fetus deserves a chance to be born.

Tragedy: Erick found Marlise unconscious on the kitchen floor in late November. She'd likely suffered an embolism that cut off oxygen to her brain. She was 14 weeks pregnant and has never regained consciousness

Questions: In Texas, state law stipulates that, 
in cases of pregnant women, DNRs do not apply and all measures must be 
taken to save the life of the fetus

Erick Munoz said his wife, a fellow paramedic, was clear with him before he found her unconscious on November 26: If she ever fell into this kind of condition, pull life support. But John Peter Smith Hospital says it's bound by state law that prohibits the withdrawal of treatment from a pregnant patient, although several experts interviewed by The Associated Press have said the hospital is misapplying the law.

Munoz's attorneys, Heather King and Jessica Hall Janicek, issued a statement Wednesday describing the condition of the fetus, now believed to be at about 22 weeks' gestation. King and Janicek based their statement on medical records they received from the hospital.

'According to the medical records we have been provided, the fetus is distinctly abnormal,' the attorneys said. 'Even at this early stage, the lower extremities are deformed to the extent that the gender cannot be determined.'

The attorneys said the fetus also has fluid building up inside the skull and possibly has a heart problem.

Normal heartbeat: Doctors previously said that the baby has a normal heartbeat and had the potential to be carried to full term

'Quite sadly, this information is not surprising due to the fact that the fetus, after being deprived of oxygen for an indeterminate length of time, is gestating within a dead and deteriorating body, as a horrified family looks on in absolute anguish, distress and sadness,' the attorneys said.

Spokeswomen for the hospital and the Tarrant County District Attorney's office, which is representing the hospital in the lawsuit, declined to comment Wednesday.

A hearing in the case is scheduled for Friday. Munoz's lawsuit asks a judge to order the hospital to pull life support and return Marlise Munoz's body to her family.

Several experts have said the Texas Advance Directives Act doesn't apply in this case because Marlise Munoz, having suffered brain death, is legally and medically dead — a key argument in Erick Munoz's lawsuit.

Munoz previously told the AP he wasn't confident about the health of the fetus. His wife was 14 weeks pregnant when he found her unconscious in November, possibly from a blood clot.

A 2010 article in the journal BMC Medicine found 30 cases of brain-dead pregnant women over about 30 years. Of 19 reported results, the journal found 12 in which a viable child was born and had post-birth data for two years on only six of them — all of whom developed normally, according to the journal.

I don't agree with this law': Erick says he can't fulfill his promise to his wife because of the Texas law, which applies to all pregnant women, even those with do not resuscitate orders

'We knew what her wishes were': Both Erick and Marlise were both paramedics. He found her collapsed on November 26 and initiated CPR, but it was no use. Erick says the couple had seen enough in the line of duty to know they wouldn't want to be kept alive by machines
