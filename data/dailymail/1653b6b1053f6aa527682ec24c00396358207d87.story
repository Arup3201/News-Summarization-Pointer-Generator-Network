Trapped: Akifa Khatun, 19, stopped growing just before her second birthday and must be carried everywhere by her mother Apila, 42

At first glance Ajifa Khatun could be any little girl, playing with her brothers and sisters and getting a hug from her doting mother.

But although Ajifa looks like a toddler, she is in fact 19, having stopped growing just before her second birthday.

Ajifa weighs just 1st 3lbs, and still needs to be spoon-fed and carried everywhere by her mother Apila, 42.

The teenager was a healthy baby when she was born in 1994 and it wasn't long before she started to walk and talk.

However, her development then stalled.

Doctors initially told her mother and father, Sekh, 52, that Ajifa would start growing again.

They then blamed cancer for her condition, before suggesting that it could be a hormone disorder and the family are still at a loss as to why Ajifa is how she is.

Scientists believe that Ajifa could have Laron Syndrome, a rare genetic condition, which is believed to have affected just 300 people across the globe - with a third of them living in in remote villages in Ecuador’s southern Loja province.

People living with Laron lack a hormone called Insulin-like Growth Factor 1, or IGF-1, which stimulates the cell to grow and 
divide to form new cells.

Too much of the hormone can lead a person
to develop breast, prostate or bowel cancers at an early age, meaning people with Laron will never get cancer, or diabetes.

'Ajifa is likely to maintain her childlike features for the majority of her life,' Tam Fry from the Child Growth Foundation told The Sun. Mr Fry believes Ajifa 'probably' has Laron Syndrome.

Brothers and sisters: Ajifa (front) with her siblings (left to right) Danish, eight, Rabiya, 14 and 17-year-old Rini

Ajifa's younger sisters Rini, 17, Rabiya, 14, and brother Danish, eight, now tower over her, while her vocabulary extends only to 'maa', for mother, 'baba' for father, and 'didi' for sister.

She is physically and cognitively similar to a two-year-old, and has an IQ of less than 20.

Her condition bears an uncanny resemblance to a US woman, Brooke Greenberg, who died in October last year aged 20 after puzzling doctors for years.

No formal diagnosis for Brooke’s condition was ever given, leading doctors to term it 'Syndrome X'.

Friends: Ajifa passes the time playing with local children, only able to take a few baby steps without help

Instead of going to school or out to work like her peers and siblings, Ajifa, who lives in Mirapar, West Bengal, India, passes the time playing with local children, only able to take a few baby steps without help.

'She's a delight and always has a smile on her face, but it's heartbreaking to see her trapped in this life,' Mrs Khatun told The Sun.

Her father said his 'beautiful' daughter is always smiling and brings joy to her family.

'She doesn't communicate much but she knows what's going on around her,' he said.

Theory: Scientists believe that Ajifa could have Laron Syndrome, a rare genetic condition, which is believed to have affected just 300 people across the globe - including these people in Ecuador

Scientists have suggested that Ajifa Khatun could have Laron Syndrome, which has been diagnosed in just 300 people across the globe. 

The syndrome is named for  Israeli endocrinologist Zvi Laron, who in the late 1950s began studying patients, some with childhood diabetes and others with growth and sexual development disorders.

His earliest patients included three young siblings—two boys and a 
girl— all with severely stunted growth. They were all obese, with thin 
hair, pronounced foreheads, and a collapsed nasal bridge, and their 
grandparents were first cousins.

Laron assumed they had a severe 
shortage of growth hormone, but some years later, after new blood tests 
were developed, it transpired the levels of growth hormone were 
abnormal—they were extremely high.

By the mid-1960s he had 
identified 20 more such people. He reasoned that either they had 
defective hormones, or something was wrong with the cells that respond 
to those hormones.

People who inherit the rare genetic condition do not produce a hormone called Insulin-like Growth Factor 1, or IGF-1, and are completely free of two of the most debilitating illnesses - diabetes and cancer.

It is IGF-1, not growth hormone, that stimulates the cell to grow and divide to form new cells.

Too much of the hormone can lead a person to develop 
breast, prostate or bowel cancers at an early age.

Scientists are now developing a drug which they hope will do artificially 
what the genetic defect in Laron Syndrome does naturally -  protect 
against DNA damage that fuels cancer growth.

People with Laron Syndrome are in perfect proportion but grow only to an average height of 4ft.

A third of those diagnosed live in remote villages in Ecuador’s southern Loja province.
