Savings: Families can save up to £300 a year by switching to smaller suppliers such as First Utility

An estimated 150,000 families have left the  ‘big six’ energy giants so far this winter in protest at spiralling prices, experts say.

Customers who switch to a smaller supplier, such as First Utility or Ovo Energy, can save up to £300 a year.

Comparison websites had record levels of visitors looking for a better deal as the six dominant suppliers – British Gas, SSE, EDF, E.ON, npower and Scottish Power – imposed above-inflation price rises.

At npower, the average bill soared by 10.4 per cent.

Some 150,000 people have made the move to smaller firms in the last two months, said Mark Todd, of website energyhelpline.com. He added: ‘We’re seeing record levels  of switching. The big six are under serious attack from  new contenders.

‘The major suppliers still dominate in terms of customer numbers, but they don’t in terms of switches any more.

‘Smaller firms are offering credible alternatives that save people lots of money – hence they are switching in droves.’

But around half of homes, including many pensioners and people who are renting, have never switched suppliers, energy regulator Ofgem said.

As a result, some 13million families, including some of the poorest in society, could be missing out on the best deals.

Smaller suppliers include Co-operative Energy, Ovo Energy, First Utility and US-backed firm Green Star Energy.

The findings come as the government wields market forces to try to keep energy prices in check

A typical deal with a big six firm 
costs £1,320 a year, while First Utility’s best fixed deal is just 
£1,037, meaning some people could save £300 a year.  Website 
MoneySupermarket.com has also seen a massive growth in demand to switch,
 with more than 15 times as many people searching for cheap tariffs 
since the big six began pushing up prices. Spokesman Clare Francis said:
 ‘The vast majority of households have never switched energy provider 
and as a result are paying over the odds.

‘We’ve
 still got a long way to go before switching becomes habitual, but it 
appears as though the latest round of price hikes could prove to be the 
tipping point.’

The 
Government is keen to use the threat of customers switching as a tool to
 keep energy prices in check, rather than having to intervene directly 
in the market.

However, the
 proportion of people prepared to switch for a deal is still low enough 
that it has not had much effect on the prices or customer service 
offered by the big six.

The
simplest, and often best, way to slash your energy bills is to use an online 
service that can compare all the best tariffs on offer for you.
