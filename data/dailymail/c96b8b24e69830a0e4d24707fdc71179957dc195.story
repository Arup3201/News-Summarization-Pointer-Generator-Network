An American theatre is the latest to offer so-called 'Tweet seats' where audience members are encouraged to post comments about the performance on the social messaging site.

The Guthrie Theatre in Minneapolis, Minnesota, has formalised a growing trend in theatre audiences to use their phones from within auditoria by giving obsessive tweeters a section of their own.

Its management have roped off a special balcony-level section of the theatre 'that will not be disruptive to other patrons' for the latest run of The Servant With Two Masters.

ROFL at Hamlet! Tweet seats are the latest craze to take over U.S. theatres as arts bosses give into to customers who just can't put down their smart phones

The Guthrie is not the first arts institution to cater specifically for, and even encourage, Twitter users.

The Cincinnati Symphony Orchestra, Palm Beach Opera in Florida and the Public Theater in New York have all reportedly experimented with special sections for visitors who can't keep off their phones.

The trend has also even threatened British threatres, with critics expressing mixed feelings about the increasing tendency of audiences in London's West End to reach for their phones during performances.

'There's little doubt that it disturbs other audience members, and probably even cast members,' wrote David Lister in The Independent recently.

Some days in life will always be remembered, whether it’s your wedding day, the birth of a child or a perfect holiday.

Other days - a family row, a stressful time at work or last-minute Christmas shopping - are probably best forgotten.

But for a growing band of ‘lifeloggers’, every single day is recorded in minute detail and stored for future reference.

Fans say lifelogging allows them to create a perfect digital archive which can be accessed at any time, whether it’s to recall a favourite moment in exact detail or simply check where they left their car keys.

But critics argue it is a self-inflicted form of the Big Brother dystopia predicted by George Orwell’s novel 1984, in which every word and movement could be seen and scrutinised.

Lifeloggers seek to capture daily details, either through pictures and video stored on the internet or by recording the patterns of their mood, sleep, exercise or diet.

So far, only a handful of users have broadcast their lives on the internet for others to see, but the popularity of blogging sites like Twitter suggests that others will not hesitate as the technology becomes more available.

'And, of course, one hopes that people are too busy concentrating on the action to fish their mobile out of their pocket or bag.

'On the other hand, they are engaged enough to want a post a review.'

In a classic case of 'if you can't beat 'em, join 'em', theatres and auditoria offering tweet seats make an effort to locate them in an area where smartphone glow will not distract other customers.

Forward-thinking arts executives believe that social media could even be enrich the experience offered by the production.

Guthrie External Relations Director Trish Santini said: 'If there were ever a Guthrie show to host Tweet Seats, it's The Servant of Two Masters.

'This cast is an incredible ensemble of comedians, and night after night they're riffing and improvising-it's the kind of show that makes you ask, "Did they just say that?"

'Usually they did - and tweeting should be a great way to talk about it.'

However, if past experience is anything to go by, there are unlikely to be too many insightful comments winging their way across the Twittersphere.

Peter Funt wrote on the subject in the New York Times: 'According to actual postings during a concert featuring works of Mozart, furnished by the Cincinnati Symphony, withak53 wrote: “Music hall looks a lot prettier from the top balcony.”

'And hippielunatic tweeted: “Star spangled banner always chokes me up a bit in music hall.”'
