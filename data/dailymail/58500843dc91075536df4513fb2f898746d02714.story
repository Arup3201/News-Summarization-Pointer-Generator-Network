A new way of diagnosing glaucoma which involves patients watching episodes of Dad's Army has been developed by scientists. 

By scanning and analysing their eye movements, researchers at City University London were able to identify cases of the common eye disease, with almost 80 per cent accuracy.

The irreversible condition is caused by progressive damage to the optic nerve, and leads to a loss of peripheral vision and eventual blindness.

Scientists have developed a new test to detect glaucoma, by scanning and analysing eye movements as a person watches TV. While studying glaucoma patients and healthy individuals, they used clips from Dad's Army

Around the world it is thought to affect 65 million people, but many remain undiagnosed. 

Scientists hope the eye movement test will in future allow clinicians to spot cases earlier, allowing treatment to begin while there is still time to save a patient's sight.

In a study involving 44 elderly glaucoma patients and 32 healthy individuals, the system identified 79 per cent of those who had the disease.

The rate of false diagnoses of healthy individuals was one in 10.

Lead scientist Professor David Crabb, from City University London, said: 'These are early results but we've found we can identify patients with glaucoma by monitoring how people watch TV.

'This could make a huge difference in detecting or monitoring a disease which currently results in one in 10 of all blindness registrations in the UK and about a million NHS appointments a year for those with the disease.

A complete eye examination includes five common tests to detect glaucoma.

It is important people have their eyes tested regularly.

Before the age of 40 it is recommended people have a test every two years.

From 40 to 54 that should increase to every one to three years. 

Between the ages of 55 to 64 a test should be performed every two years and after the age of 65, this should be every year. 

The five tests measure:

'Once the damage is done it cannot be reversed, so early diagnosis is vital for identifying a disease which will continue to get more prevalent as our population ages.'

The study participants, who had an average age of 69, were  asked to watch TV and film clips on a computer.

Professor Crabb said the clips included episodes of an old favourite, Dad's Army.

At the same time, their eye movements were tracked and the information fed into a computer. 

The software plotted the saccade patterns - fast movements of the eye - on to a grid and was able to spot subtle differences between them.

Certain patterns, only clearly discernible by the computer, correlated with having glaucoma.

'What we've done is use a mathematical technique to find patterns in these grids that allow us to distinguish between the groups,' said Professor Crabb.

'If you look very closely there are features that are slightly different, but you need a computer to recognise them.

'The eye movements are very fast, quicker than heartbeats.'

The research stemmed from a theory linking eye movement patterns with loss of peripheral vision.

Current tests for gluacoma involve five different steps, carried out during regular eye examinations

Professor Crabb said: 'Someone with moderate glaucoma would have a piece of their field of view that is missing. 

'Their brain has to continually move their eyes around to fill in the gaps. We believe the eye movements compensate for the missing information.'

He added that a variant of the same technique might be able to diagnose other eye diseases, such as macular degeneration, which is marked by the loss of central vision.

Neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's and Parkinson's were also thought to affect eye movements.

Dr Dolores Conroy, director of research at the charity Fight for Sight, which funded the study, said: 'One of Fight for Sight's six long-term goals is to enable conditions such as glaucoma to be detected earlier.

'Early diagnosis and treatment can stop people losing their sight, so we're very pleased that this proof-of-principle eye movement study opens the door to developing a new clinical test for glaucoma.'
