North Korea's decision to launch a long-range rocket this week drew international condemnation from Washington to Tokyo.

But this video clip reveals the enthusiastic reception it was given by state media within the secretive country.

The animated female anchor appears exhilarated as she describes the launch, which was reported by state media as the successful positioning of a weather satellite in space.

Britain's Foreign Secretary William Hague was among the international figures that were quick to condemn North Korea's move on Wednesday as 'provocative'.

It is feared the rogue state could be working towards a missile on which a nuclear warhead could be mounted.

Mr Hague summoned the North Korean ambassador to the Foreign Office to demand an explanation following a 'clear violation' of at least two United Nations Security Council resolutions.

'This provocative act will increaseÂ  tensions in the region. I deplore the fact that the Democratic People's Republic of Korea has chosen to prioritise this launch over improving the livelihood of its people,' he said yesterday.

In the U.S., the White House labelled the rocket test a 'highly provocative act that threatens regional security'.

North Korea's Unha rocket, named after the Korean word for 'galaxy', blasted off from the Sohae launch pad in Tongchang-ri, north-west of Pyongyang, shortly before 1am UK time yesterday.

Pride in the scientific advancement appeared to outweigh the fear of greater international punishment and isolation, with people dancing in the streets in Pyongyang as vans drove around announcing the news.
