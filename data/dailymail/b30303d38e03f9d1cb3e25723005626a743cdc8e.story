A worker has been suspended over claims he took pictures and posted derogatory comments about a library visitor, including one saying 'his gut is like the Alps' and another branding him 'mad'.

The man allegedly secretly photographed the member of the public in South Shields near Newcastle-upon-Tyne and put a series of images and upsetting jokes about his physical appearance online.

Another of the messages, some using obscene language, said: 'A snapshot while he was scratching away at his head with his tongue hanging out' along with a picture.

Another comment reads: 'His gut is like a scaled-down version of the Alps,' before adding: 'He's using a computer near me. He's got four carrier bags of cardigans and opened letters with him. Mad.'

The incident happened at Cleadon Park Primary Care Centre and Library, a community centre in South Shields.

Upsetting: The staff member apparently wrote on Facebook the man had a 'gut like the Alps'

An investigation has been launched after a complaint was made to his employer, the North East Council on Addictions (NECA).

John Humble, a voluntary worker and former housing officer with South Shields Citizens' Advice Bureau, saw the posts.

He alerted staff to the messages when he called in at the primary care centre late last month.

He spotted the worker and reported the issue to the centre's practice manager and chief librarian, making them aware of what he labelled 'vile messages and breaches of client confidentiality'.

Mr Humble says he is relieved that an investigation had been launched, adding that he has also taken his complaint to the National Health Service and Parliamentary ombudsman.

Mr Humble said: 'These are absolutely disgusting, vulgar and deplorable comments about an innocent person.

'It is a clear breach of this person's confidentiality and of NHS policy. When I initially raised the issue, I wasn't happy with the response, but I'm glad that this investigation is now to be carried out.'

South Tyneside Council helps oversee the services offered at Cleadon Park.

A council spokesman, speaking on behalf of the authority, South Tyneside CVS and NECA. said: 'We are aware of the concerns that have been raised regarding this matter.

'A member of staff has been suspended while we work closely to ensure a thorough investigation is carried out'.
