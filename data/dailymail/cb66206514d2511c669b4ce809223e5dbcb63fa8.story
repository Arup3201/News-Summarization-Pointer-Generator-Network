A woman has been arrested for allegedly conning her Port Charlotte church with claims her four sons had been killed in action - soliciting donations and support from the well-meaning congregation.

Shirley Duncan, 49, of North Port, Florida was arrested on Thursday after allegedly dressing in black to attend the Community Life Center Church in Port Charlotte, claiming her boys had all been killed while fighting for their country. 

In fact she is a mother of two and only one of her sons serves in the armed forces.

Nicanol 'Nick' Collazo stationed at Fort Knox, Kentucky, is alive and well and alerted local police to his mother's alleged scam in which she is claimed to have raided his Facebook account as well as using random soldier pictures from the internet to make her story seem real.

She even held a memorial service using pictures of her armed forces son following his 'death' in Iraq in October.

Senior pastor Mark Coffey told the ABC News: 'This really takes the cake. When you come up and you are dressed in black and you literally have tears flowing in the church service. Coming up after and saying pastor please pray for me.'

She allegedly told Pastor Coffey and church members that he was her fourth son killed on the front line.

She told them she was struggling to make ends meet following her youngest son's death and needed help with bills, members of the church told the channel.

'She asked for a bill to be paid. We did, just like we would for anybody else,' Pastor Coffey said.

It total parishioners gave Duncan more than $1,000 in cash and goods to help her make ends meet including clothes and furniture.

The church asked Duncan for documentation related to the deaths.

She presented them with a letter supposedly from the secretary of war signed by an Adjutant General J.A. Ulio -detectives later discovered he had died 50 years ago.

Parishoner Anne Soloduk said they thought something was unusual in her case but they felt they couldn't accuse her of wrongdoing given the subject matter. 'In our gut we felt that something just wasn't right but you hate to accuse any mother of lying about dead children,' she told ABC.

Eventually her son suspected the deception and contacted the Charlotte County Sheriff's Office.

The church tried to contact Ms Duncan to say they would forgive her if she came to them to explain but she never returned.

Police say she may have used a similar scam at other churches in the area.

In a statement Sheriff Bill Prummell commented: 'It really sickens me when someone pulls at the heartstrings of people who want to help, and yet take advantage of them and our military men and women by profiting from her actions.' She is being held at Charlotte County Jail on charges of fraud and reportedly denies any wrongdoing.
