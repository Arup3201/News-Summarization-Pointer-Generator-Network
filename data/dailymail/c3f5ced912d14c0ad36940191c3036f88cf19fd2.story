On the run: Sergei Polonsky has been posting pictures of himself on Twitter since he skipped bail

A missing businessman who should be the star witness in a trial featuring media tycoon Alexander Lebedev has been put on Russia’s ‘wanted’ list after being charged in connection with a £121 million fraud and theft case.

Sergei Polonsky is accused of embezzling millions in downpayments from potential residents of a luxury residential development in Moscow. 

Polonsky, who is believed to be hiding in Israel, failed to appear before police investigators last week in Moscow.

His absence is now set to trigger a hunt by Interpol and demands for his extradition to Russia.

The property mogul has apparently 
been on the run after skipping bail following his arrest in Cambodia 
over an allegation of assault.

He
has since taunted investigators by tweeting a series of pictures of 
himself in exotic places.

One of the latest, posted on June 8, shows him
in a boat in what looks like a location in the Far East.

The
fraud charges ‘have been brought in absentia through his lawyer’, 
according to a spokesman for the Russian Interior Ministry, who added 
that Polonsky could be imprisoned for ten years if found guilty.

Polonsky’s
arraignment in a major fraud case highlights the increasing sense of 
fiasco over the trial of Lebedev, 53, whose family owns the Independent 
newspapers and London Evening Standard.

Lebedev, who also owns Russia’s only major independent investigative newspaper, is accused of hooliganism motivated by political hatred in hitting out at Polonsky during a confrontation on a TV talk show.

Lebedev’s legal team has branded the Moscow trial a ‘farce’, yet it is due to continue on Friday.

Many believe that the hooliganism charge, which carries a penalty of up to five years in jail, is part of a crackdown ordered by President Vladimir Putin on his enemies and critics.

Mr Putin is scheduled to arrive in Downing Street today for talks with David Cameron ahead of the G8 summit in Northern Ireland.

The
fraud and theft charges against Polonsky in Russia follow complaints 
from people who bought apartments at his exclusive Kutuzovskaya Milya 
development in Moscow.

Detectives
from a special unit tasked with fighting organised crime and corruption
searched the homes of  the current and former top managers at 
developers Potok 8, formerly called Mirax Group, a business linked to 
Polonsky.

An Interior Ministry spokesman said: 
‘Items and documents have been seized that provide evidence that the 
claimants’ money was transferred to the accounts of organisations that 
were not involved in the project.’

Mikhail Aleksandrov, head of the investigating unit, said: ‘Investigators are accusing Polonsky of fraud and theft both from legal entities and individuals.

‘Given the fact that he refused to show up at the investigation department, he will be put on the international wanted list in accordance with Russian laws.

‘He will be put on the Interpol wanted list if police fail to locate his whereabouts in Russia.’

Kong Radi, a lawyer acting for the fugitive tycoon in Cambodia, said recently that he had ‘no idea’ of Polonsky’s whereabouts and had not seen him since early April.

Lebedev yesterday claimed the money Polonsky is accused of embezzling was diverted to projects in London, Switzerland and Turkey.
