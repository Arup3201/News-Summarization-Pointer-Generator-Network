It is a faithful companion, following your every move, recording as it goes.

The first 'pet' drone that can automatically follow its owner has been revealed - and could change the way sports are filmed.

Called Airdog, the drone can be fitted with a GoPro camera to capture high definition footage of extreme sports, tracking everything from skateboarders to BMX riders.

Here boy! the Airdog drone that can follow its owner to record their action

To use AirDog, a programmable remote is strapped to the wrist or helmet.

AirDog has preset flight modes to track different sports - including surfing, motocross, wakeboarding and skateboarding.

The AirDog has a flight time of up to 15 minutes, and can reach speeds of 40 mph.

It can take off and land automatically, and uses gyro stabilisation technology to ensure the subject is always in frame.

The drone can track and follow users and their trajectory.

'The AirDog is ready to follow you wherever you go,' its makers boast.

'No remote control skills are necessary.'

Takeoff and landing is completely autonomous, and the AirDog has preset flight modes to track different sports - including surfing, motocross, wakeboarding and skateboarding.

The firm say the key to the drone is the algorithm it uses to track people.

'It took a year and countless caffeine-fueled hours, that were spent hacking intelligent flight code algorithms,' said Edgars Rozentals, CEO and founder of Helico Aerospace Industries, which creating the project, and is raising funds on Kickstarter for the $995 drone.

The colourfyul drone is linked to a wrist controller worn by its owners, so it knows exactly where they are

'The result is extremely intelligent simple to use drone technology for every action sports enthusiast out there.

'From its roots the Airdog was designed to serve and obey those pushing the boundaries in sports.'

The team hopes to raise $200,000 US from the 40 day campaign.

With  the financial boost, AirDog will make it to production and into the hands of sports enthusiasts.

Campaign pledgers will be the first to obtain the AirDog for $995 - $1,195 US.

The wrist controllers allows riders to control the drone's behaviour remotely

The drone also has an app that can be used to programme its flightpath and to see footage
