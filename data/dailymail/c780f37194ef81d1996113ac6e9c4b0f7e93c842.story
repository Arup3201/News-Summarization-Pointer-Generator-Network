A cat has miraculously escaped death after being stabbed in the head with a kitchen knife.

The stray was found in bushes with the 6in blade sticking out of his skull in the city of Sevastopol in the Crimea Peninsula, and was taken to vets who found the knife had penetrated 2in into his head.

However the blade missed his brain - and the cat, named Zelonyy (Mr Green), is now expected to make a full recovery after undergoing emergency surgery.

Close to death: The stray was found in bushes with the 6in blade sticking out of his skull in Sevastopol

X-ray: He was taken to vets in the Crimea Peninsula, who found the knife had penetrated 2in into his head

Emergency surgery: The blade missed his brain - and Zelonyy the cat is now expected to make a full recovery

Lyudmila Alexeeva - who used to feed strays outside her home in the south-western Crimean Peninsula - was shocked when her favourite cat emerged with the knife sticking out of his head.

Ms Alexeeva told local television: ‘When I went to look for him I found him hiding under a bush and was shocked to see a knife sticking out of his head even though he was still alive.’

She said she took the animal to the nearest vets in the Peninsula - which is the subject of territorial dispute between Russia and Ukraine - where it had been surgically removed under an anaesthetic.

Natalia Morozova, president of a local charity for homeless animals, said: ‘We think the cat had been stabbed on Friday 13, and had therefore been injured for some time before he was found.

Attack: The cat is said to have been stabbed last Friday - and was injured for some time before being found

Getting better: Although the prognosis after the incident was poor, vets now believe that the cat will make a full recovery after not observing any changes in his behaviour despite the head injury

‘The knife was wedged in the skull and the cat had probably run off before its attacker could remove the blade.’

The prognosis after the incident in the city's Sakharnoy neighbourhood was poor.

But vets now believe that Zelonyy will make a full recovery after not observing any changes in his behaviour despite the head injury.

The cat will however have to remain in care while vets make sure an infection does not set in as a result of the injury. 

The charity said police had been informed about the incident.
