These new pictures show the RAF's next-generation F-35B fighter, bristling with fearsome state-of-the-art weaponry.

However, the deadly-looking weapons are actually trial or 'dummy' ordnance, which are identical in fit and form to their lethal counterparts but incapable of causing damage.

A UK test team including personnel from BAE Systems, has successfully completed initial aircraft handling trials for ASRAAM and Paveway IV weapons on the F-35B Lightning II aircraft at Patuxent River Naval Air Station in Maryland, United States.

The 'weapons' were tested on the Short Take-off Vertical Landing (STOVL) F-35B for the first time during a series of flights from the US Navy's test facility.

Two F-35B STOVL aircraft, flown by Billie Flynn, Lockheed Martin's F-35 test pilot and Squadron Leader Andy Edgell from the RAF, completed 9 flights with ASRAAM missiles and  Paveway IV laser guided bombs. The flights involved different configurations of both weapons types on the aircraft

The initial tests are an important step in integrating weapons onto the F-35B, allowing test pilots to understand how they affect the way the aircraft performs and handles.

The planes feature short take-off and vertical landing (STOVL) technology and the latest stealth and intelligence surveillance, target acquisition and reconnaissance (ISTAR) technology. 

The RAF already uses ASRAAM air-to-air missiles and Paveway IV - a 500lb weapon capable of taking out a small compound - on its existing combat air fleet. The successful tests are a step towards full integration between the current and future fast jets that will be used by the RAF and the UK's Royal Navy from 2018.

The successful tests will be followed by the next stage of weapons testing due to take place in early 2015. These tests will involve weapon separation and then guided releases of both ASRAAM and Paveway IV from the aircraft.

BAE Systems' lead test pilot for F-35, Pete 'Wizzer' Wilson, said: 'The team at Patuxent River has got over two thousand hours of flying under their belts for the F-35B variant and the handling and performance of the aircraft has shone through throughout. These latest trials were no exception and help us to move confidently into the next phase of weapons testing.'

J.D. McFarlan, Lockheed Martin's vice president for F-35 test & verification from the Joint Strike Fighter programme added: 'These trials show the truly international nature of the F-35 enterprise - being led out of a U.S. Navy facility, involving a joint UK Ministry of Defence and industry team, working alongside the U.S. Department of Defence and Lockheed Martin.

'And the test results for one partner will benefit all, further demonstrating the versatility and capability of the F-35 as a multi-role platform.'

Britain on Monday announced it had signed a contract with US manufacturer Lockheed Martin to buy the first of 14 F-35B combat jets.

The four Lightning II stealth combat aircraft will operate from both of the Royal Navy's forthcoming new aircraft carriers and from Royal Air Force land bases, with another 10 due to be ordered over the next five years.

Aircrew: One

Max speed: 1.6Mach (1,217.3mph)

Length: 51ft

Wingspan: 35ft

Max. altitude: 50,000ft 

The first batch is expected to be delivered in 2016 and will take up station in 2018. 

'The investment we are making in the F-35 aircraft will ensure we are securing the skies for decades to come, providing the UK with the latest stealth technology and multi-role aircraft capability,' said Philip Dunne, minister for defence equipment support and technology. 

The British government has long planned to provide its air and naval forces with F-35Bs and signed an agreement in principle to buy the four jets last month.

The F-35 should have appeared at this year's Farnborough International Airshow near London, but was grounded by technical problems and could not cross the Atlantic Ocean.

Britain's navy is currently without an aircraft carrier but a new carrier, HMS Queen Elizabeth, is due to go into service in 2020 with another, HMS Prince of Wales, to follow.
