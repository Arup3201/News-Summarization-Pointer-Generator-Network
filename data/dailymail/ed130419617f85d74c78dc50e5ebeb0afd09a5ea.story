Drunks injured in booze-fuelled brawls should be charged for their NHS treatment, Nick Clegg said today.

The Deputy Prime Minister revealed he backed the idea of imposing levies on people who get ‘completely blind drunk and gets themselves into a scrap’.

An estimated two million visits are made to A&E every year for alcohol-related illnesses and injuries. Experts say the cost of alcohol to the NHS exceeds £3billion per year.

The government has already imposed new rules allowing police and councils to charge nightclubs and pubs a fee for the cost of policing town centres.

Mr Clegg admitted some town and city centres have become ‘no-go areas’ in on Thursday, Friday and Saturday nights.

He said it was unacceptable for the taxpayer to pick up the bill for the National Health Service to treat drunk patients whose injuries are self-inflicted.

Mr Clegg said: ‘I’ve actually got quite a lot of sympathy with the basic  principle that says why should someone that goes out and gets completely  blind drunk,  behaves appallingly, gets themselves into  trouble and a scrap.

‘Why should other people always have to pick up the tab to help them out?’

Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg said it was not fair for the taxpayer to pick up the bill for treating self-inflicted alcohol-related injuries

The Lib Dem leader was challenged over the costs to the health service during his weekly radio phone-in on LBC 97.3.

A caller, Tony from Chislehurst, told him: ‘It seems to me a no-brainer - I don’t think you could lose a vote - if you were to make people responsible for the cost they occur if they go out and get blind drunk or have a fight and need stiches – it all comes to a cost.

‘Why can’t those costs be handed over to the people that incur them?’

Mr Clegg admitted the idea was ‘a bit tricky’ but revealed he supported the idea of charging people who repeatedly end up in casualty with alcohol-related injuries.

‘It’s quite difficult to do it but I actually think the principle you’re talking about is not entirely bad one.

‘Some-one who wilfully through their own actions basically creates a lot of trouble and hassle for the NHS which everyone else has to pay for, at some point you might want to say to them maybe not on the first occasion but… I don’t have the how but I do understand the why.’

The Home Office has already given councils the power to impose a late night levy on pubs and clubs to help with the costs of policing.

Mr Clegg said it was right that landlords are made to 'cough up in order to deal with the problems they create'.

He added: 'The rules have changed so that local authorities can get nightclubs and pubs and others where there is evidence that they are systematically turning a blind eye to the problem that they are creating that they have to chip in as well, for instance to shoulder some of the policing costs.

'That was something that I was very supportive of. You know what it’s like, there are parts of our towns and cities where frankly it can be a bit of a no-go area on Thursday, Friday, and Saturday night.

'And I don’t see why people who create some of that problem shouldn’t shoulder some of the costs for dealing with the problems that they partly create.'

Critics said many injuries were inflicted by other people who had been drinking. Eric Appleby, chief executive of Alcohol Concern, added most hospitals have alcohol liaison nurses, which helps cut admissions.

The NHS faces a budget squeeze while trying to provide services like the London Ambulance Service's Booze Bus which pickis up people seriously affected by alcohol

Researchers last year said at least one in three patients seen in emergency departments because of drink then have to be admitted to hospital for further treatment.

The study looked at adults seeking emergency care at Bristol Royal Infirmary over four weeks.

Some 774 patients were asked  questions about their reasons for attending A&E and their average weekly alcohol consumption.

Doctors were also asked whether the emergency was directly or indirectly related to alcohol, or was unrelated.

Around one in five patients said  they had drunk alcohol before coming to A&E while 14 per cent felt their injury was related to drink.

Of these, around half – 50 patients – believed they had been injured by someone who had been drinking, while a similar proportion had consumed more than the maximum recommended weekly units.

Of the 111 patients who felt their attendance was related to alcohol, one in three was then admitted to hospital, the Emergency Medicine journal reports. Doctors said around one in five visits was related to alcohol, with one in ten blaming their visit on drink-related violence.

Based on the findings, the researchers estimate alcohol may be involved in up to 640,000 hospital admissions and nearly two million visits to A&E in England and Wales each year.

Figures from the NHS Information Centre earlier this month show there were 1,168,000 patients admitted to hospital as a result of alcohol in 2011 – up 11 per cent since 2010.
