Manchester United's frantic rebuilding programme to patch up the inadequate squad left by Sir Alex Ferguson has been a major factor in propelling Premier League spending to record levels for a summer window.

The combined outlay for the 20 clubs stood at £755.9million, even before United's £14m deal to buy Daley Blind from Ajax, subject to medical and personal terms, was announced. Of that, £570m has gone overseas, with Spain alone receiving £238.7m.

The arrival of Blind will take United's summer spree to almost £150m and sets up a tantalising question with just a few dozen hours of this window remaining. Will this be a £1billion window?

Record: Manchester United paid £60million to bring Angel di Maria to Old Trafford from Real Madrid

Bow: Di Maria made his United debut in the goalless draw at Burnley on Saturday

Is it possible that these clubs from just one division can spend an average of £50m apiece in one transfer period? And that does include at least the equivalent commitment in wages to the new players.

Already last summer's Premier League record spend of £630m for one transfer window has been smashed. Based on last year's activity, it is possible that the total on the Sunday morning before the window closes can leap by about a quarter when the window shuts.

Last summer £507m turned to £630m at the close of business. The same percentage rise will see the £1bn figure pushed close.

Conditions this time are even more amenable to a late splurge, as United and their major rivals bolster their squads in the hope that they will be good enough for top-four finishes - and lucrative Champions League football - or even genuine title tilts.

Big bucks: Chile international Alexis Sanchez left Barcelona to join Arsenal in a £30million deal

Decisive: Sanchez celebrates a crucial goal against Besiktas in the Champions League play-off round

The rest of the division are also spending because they need strength in depth to try to stay in the division - and remain on the gravy train.

That is why United splashed a British record fee of £59.7m on Angel Di Maria, why Chelsea bought Diego Costa and Arsenal bought Alexis Sanchez for £32m each - and why all three clubs will remain in the market before the window closes.

Southampton have splashed out £12m for Shane Long, and West Ham have paid the same for Enner Valencia. Everton broke their own record to buy £28m Romelu Lukaku from Chelsea while Leicester spent £8m on Leonardo Ulloa.

Arrivals: £20m defender Dejan Lovren is one of many new Liverpool signings this summer

Shift: Lovren moved to Anfield from Southampton, along with Adam Lallana and Rickie Lambert

Splashing the cash: Even despite FFP restrictions, Manchester City paid Porto £32m for Eliaquim Mangala

West Bromwich manager Alan Irvine said: 'Fees are extremely high. We started with a budget that looked good, and very quickly it looked a small budget.

Clearly, there have been huge fees paid for players, huge demands by those players and agents' fees have been considerable.'

Dan Jones, partner in the Sports Business Group at Deloitte, attributes the rise in spending to a number of factors.

They include 'the showcase for talent a World Cup provides' and the fact that each Premier League club received on average £25m more central TV cash in 2013-14 than they did the season before. 

Clinical: Chelsea signed Diego Costa from Atletico Madrid in a deal worth £32million

Off and running: Costa has scored four goals in his first three games for Jose Mourinho's side

But while a number of World Cup stars from the Brazil 2014 tournament have come to England, including Di Maria, Costa and Sanchez, history shows that there is nothing about a World Cup year that boosts spending.

In 2010, summer trade to Premier League clubs was substantially down (£365m) on 2009 (£450m).

And in 2006 it was only very marginally up on 2005. Jones's calculations on TV cash also don't tell the full story: each club received on average an extra £28m in central Premier League funds in 2013-14, or £78m against £50m, with £26m of this extra being TV cash. 

The big clubs saw bigger leaps; Liverpool's TV money went up by £43m to £97.5m, Manchester City's was up by £38.5m to £96.6m, Chelsea's was up £39.1m to £94.1m, and clubs like Arsenal, Tottenham, Newcastle, Southampton and Stoke saw rises of £30m.

Ultimately, like so many things now in elite football, it comes down to money. The clubs have the cash, and they spend it in the hope (or fear) that they can do better - and avoid failure.
