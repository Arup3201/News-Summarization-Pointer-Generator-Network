Walking down Regent Street in central London, shoppers spotted an unusual sight before them. Used to the dirt and grime of the city, the shiny bright red seats at the bus shelter and the unusual look of the bus stop for some reason brought back memories of childhood.

It was only when they got close up, that they realised that the bus stop and the bus shelter near Hamleys on Regent Street were made from 100,000 Lego bricks.

Mouths fell open as the passengers and passers-by gawped at the iconic children's toy made into an adult structure. The full-size stop and shelter are in use although the electronic display announcing the arrival of the next bus is a bit of a giveaway - it merely bears the legend: 'Next bus just a brick away'.

How many noticed? This bus stop in Regent's Street, London, is made from 100,000 Lego bricks

The astounding display, which was created by the UK’s only certified Lego professional, Duncan Titmarsh, is in commemoration
 of Transport for London’s Year of the Bus and also sees the 60th 
anniversary of the iconic Routemaster and the 75th anniversary of the 
RT-type bus (you’d know it if you see it), much beloved by generations 
of Londoners.

It is also 100 years since London buses were sent to the Western Front to play a crucial role during the First World War.

The display will stand on the capital street for the next four weeks (until July 15).

Emma Owen, the PR Manager at Lego said: ‘Lego is all about stretching your imagination and using bricks to build whatever your mind desires – there are no limits!  We hope visitors to Regent Street enjoy this fantastic build, it truly shows that with Lego you can build anything.’

It will be at the centre of this Sunday’s Regent Street Bus Calvacade at which almost 50 buses from the earliest horse-drawn models of the 1820s right up to the new Routemasters of today will be on display for visitors to get all aboard and explore.
