Brittany Murphy’s father is demanding that his daughter's body is EXHUMED after he ordered a toxicology report that left him fearing she and her husband had been poisoned to death.

Angelo Bertolotti has said he is 'pushing and pushing and pushing' the Los Angeles Coroners office to exhume the bodies of the tragic Clueless actress, who died aged 32 in December 2009, and her husband Simon Monjack, who died just five months later aged 40.

A family source told MailOnline today: 'Angelo says that he sent letters to the Coroners office, he says he's sent them the report, but he's heard nothing back'.

According to LA law, the next of kin of the deceased can order an exhumation to be carried out privately at their own cost, but the source said: 'Angelo has spent a fortune on the case so far and is waiting for the Coroners office to get involved, but he knows this may have to be done privately if the coroner doesn't give him any satisfactory answers. He's working on getting it done.'

Today, Simon Monjack's mother Linda Monjack, who continues to be haunted by her son's death, told MailOnline: 'I wouldn't be a bit surprised if they exhumed Brittany, I've been hearing talk of this for months.

Exhumed: Angelo Bertolotti,the father of Clueless star Brittany Murphy, is attempting to get the bodies of his daughter and her husband Simon Monjack exhumed

Mrs Monjack would have to give her permission for her son to be exhumed as his next of kin - but makes it clear she is not yet in agreement - as speaking from her UK home she said: 'It's incredibly upsetting.

'It's very difficult to know how you deal with it anymore. Will we ever get any answers about Simon and Brittany? No-one will help me and I just want to find out what happened.

'The toxicology test Angelo did - and it's awful result - has spurred him on to want to do more and I'm not surprised at all that he wants to exhume Brittany.'

Mr Bertolotti has teamed up with filmmaker Julia Davis, the wife of his business partner - and both believe that Brittany and Simon were poisoned. They fear Brittany was targeted by 
shadowy government agents for offering her support to Miss Davis, a Department of 
Homeland Security 'whistleblower'.

Last November, a startling report claimed that Brittany did NOT die from natural causes - despite the fact by the Los Angeles Coroner originally attributed her death to pneumonia and anemia. 

Her husband died in May 2010 at their Hollywood home reputedly from the same causes.

The star's father Mr Bertolotti, 87, finally secured the
 release of his daughter's hair, blood and tissue samples for testing 
after years of litigation and submitted them for independent testing.

Investigation: Simon Monjack, the husband of Brittany Murphy, died in eerily similar circumstances to the star, just five months after her death in December 2009. Now, pathologist Dr Cyril Wecht has been brought on board by Brittany's father Angelo Bertolotti

The
 Carlson Company then found ten heavy metals in Brittany's system which were 
several times higher than World Health Organization high levels at the 
time of her death.

'If we were to eliminate the 
possibility of a simultaneous accidental heavy metals exposure to the 
sample donor then the only logical explanation would be an exposure to 
these metals (toxins) administered by a third party perpetrator with 
likely criminal intent,' the report stated.

Heavy
 metals are found in most rodenticides and insecticides meaning the 
actress could have been slipped rat poisoning or bug killer.

At
 the time of her death, Brittany displayed all the symptoms of heavy 
metal poisoning including: headaches, dizziness, abdominal cramps, 
coughing, sweating, disorientation, wheezing, congestion and pneumonia.

Mr Bertolotti told the family source that Julia Davis is 'the one who is following things up for us.'

'We don’t have any concrete information on Brittany and Simon being exhumed, but she’s trying. We have no co-operation at this point from the Coroner’s Office. They say the case is closed, but it’s not closed. They’re liars, they’ve had every report we’ve given them. There’s a cover up somewhere.

‘The Coroners Office refuse to co-operate, why should we go privately? We’re working on getting it done. They have to co-operate with us, period. That’s going to happen. We want to force them to do it, they should do it. There’s a cover up somewhere. Why should I let them get away with this? They’re going to have admit they’re wrong. I’m taking a stand on this and all the things they’re saying are false.

'We’re on top of it, we’ll see where it goes, it’s in their ballpark, but we’re trying, just watch this space,' he claimed.

Mr Bertolotti's investigation comes as a final, haunting glimpse of Brittany came in the final film she would ever film was released last month.

The actress's final performance in Something Wicked had been held back from release since her death.

But the movie premiered in Eugene, Oregon, as a tribute to where it was filmed in 2009 and was set to be screened in Porland and Seattle.

The star has a major role in the psychological thriller, which tells the story of a young couple trying to get married, but are hampered by gruesome secrets from their past collide and sinister forces in the present.

Brittany's mother, Sharon Murphy, has denied her daughter and her husband were poisoned. 

Having brought up Brittany 
single-handedly following her divorce from Mr Bertolotti when their 
daughter was just one, she wrote in the Hollywood Reporter last November:
 'I have no choice now but to come forward in the face of inexcusable 
efforts to smear my daughter's memory by a man who may be her biological
 father but was never a real father to her in her lifetime.

'Angelo
 Bertolotti has relocated to California in his old age to claim he is 
here for Brittany, as he never was in life. He has made outrageous 
statements over the past few years, culminating in this latest madness: 
that my darling daughter was murdered.'

Sharon
 - who now lives in seclusion in Los Angeles - said: 'His claims are 
based on the most flimsy of evidence and are more of an insult than an 
insight into what really happened.'

deaths

Today, a 
spokesman for the Los Angeles County Coroners Office said: ‘There are 
private companies and pathologists out there who do perform the 
exhumation. T

'This can be 
close to the death itself or years after the the death. One of the more 
popular companies is 1 800 AUTOPSY, a lot of people go to them looking 
for a second opinion, if they're looking at medical malpractice or just 
want another opinion.

'The
 companies have got business contracts to do this - it’s a matter 
entirely between them and the family. Once the body leaves this office, 
we have no jurisdiction or control over it. It can be cremated, buried, 
moved abroad, or they can have a second autopsy.’

When asked about speculation that foul play could have been involved in her son and daughter-in-law's deaths, Mrs Monjack told MailOnline in November: 'It never crossed my mind before, but now it has.'

Campaign:
 Mr Bertolotti has told family sources he is 'pushing and pushing and pushing' for his daughter and her husband's bodies to be exhumed. Under law, he can pay for this to be privately done

Following Mr Bertolotti's private tests, Mrs Monjack told MailOnline the couple were 'very, very fearful of so many things.'

Speaking in November, she said: 'Simon
 did say he was under surveillance. He was detained by the American 
government because his passport had run out. He said he was followed and
 beaten up and he was detained for nine days,' she said.

'Brittany
 got him out eventually, but from then on they felt there was a deep 
conspiracy. There is definitely something here that's not right - but 
what it is I don't know.

'At
 the funeral in Los Angeles, Brittany's mother, Sharon, insisted on 
going to the service in an armored car and there were security guards 
with guns.'
