Delighted: Angel Stanley's father won £1million on the lottery and hopes he will buy her designer shoes

The traveller father of a girl who appeared in the hit documentary series My Big Fat Gypsy Wedding has won £1million on the lottery. 

Delighted father-of-four Jason Stanley - whose daughter Angel appeared on the show - has already blown more than £250,000 on lavish cars after hitting the jackpot last month. 

Now his children are waiting for him to splash the cash on them.

After discovering his win, the 42-year-old Romany traveller took his brood - Amber 21, Alfie, 17, Angel, 13 and Alby, nine - out for an Italian meal at a restaurant near to their home in Hayes, west London, where he broke the news. 

Angel, who is different to most traveller girls because she still attends school, said she wants something nice to wear to the Appleby Horse Fair, an annual gathering for Gypsies and Travellers, in Cumbria. She also wants a pair of Gina shoes.

Speaking to The Sun on Sunday, she said: 'It's amazing. We're all over the moon. I've told him I'd like some money to put in the bank and some proper clothes - designer stuff.'

Mr Stanley wasted no time in spending his new-found fortune after picking up the cheque.

He
bought a brand new, navy, blue Bentley costing £200,000 and 
splurged another £50,000 on a Mercedes for 17-year-old Alfie.

The horse trader is separated from his wife Simone.

Daughter Angel, who attends a school in west London, goes against gypsy norm by wanting to study for her future and sit her exams.

When she appeared in the 
programme in February she explained how she didn't want to be like other
traveller women who rely on their husbands and fathers for money.

She said: 'I want to earn my own money. I want to do something with my life. I don't want to sit at home with the children.'

Angel admits she has suffered racism at school, with some of her peers calling her 'pikey' or 'gypsy scum'.

Initially a one-off show, My Big Fat Gypsy Wedding was developed into a six part, prime-time series after it became a cult hit on Channel 4.

The documentary series revealed the eye-­popping, extravagant nuptials that appear to be the norm today among young ­traveller couples.

Viewers were given an insight into the lives and times of the modern gypsy, showing that ceremony and ritual are all-important for the travelling community in their ‘diminishing’ way of life.
