A taxi driver is recovering in hospital after he was shot at a petrol station.

Police believe the 61-year-old victim was not the intended target as a shotgun was discharged following a row between two groups of men in Kirkby, Liverpool, in the early hours of today.

It is believed four passengers of the silver Skoda Octavia taxi had been arguing with a group of six men on the forecourt in Whitefield Drive before gunfire was aimed at the vehicle.

Emergency services were called to the scene at about 1.15am and the taxi driver was discovered alone with injuries to his arm and chest.

His injuries are serious but not life-threatening and he is in a stable condition, said police.

The scene has been cordoned off for examination, house-to-house inquiries are under way and patrols have been stepped up in the area.

CCTV is being examined and an investigation into the full circumstances of the incident is continuing.

The offenders are all described as being white, five of them wore dark coloured clothing and the sixth was wearing a cream coloured Adidas-type top.

Superintendent Kevin Wellens, said: 'This thoughtless and reckless type of behaviour cannot be tolerated and we are fortunate that no-one else was injured particularly as this took place on a garage forecourt.

'This incident shows the total disregard that the offenders have for members of the community.

'I would appeal to members of the community who know the people involved to come forward so we can take positive action and take the offenders off the streets before anyone else gets hurt.

'Information from the community is vital in gaining an understanding about what happened and we urge anyone who may have witnessed anything suspicious to come forward, anonymously through Crimestoppers if necessary.

'Merseyside Police is committed to tackling gun crime and keeping our communities safe and we will act on all information we receive in relation to gun crime and those responsible.'

Anyone with information should contact Merseyside Police on 0151 777 5687, or Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111.
