Burns victim: Tara Quigley, 28, who had acid squirted in her face when she opened her front door in Romford, Essex

A woman was left badly burned after a man knocked on her door and hurled acid in her face.

Tara Quigley, 28, is being treated in a specialist burns unit following the attack.

Her dog, which she was carrying at the time, was blinded and may have to be put down.

Her sister, 30-year-old Tina Quigley, said: ‘She’s in a bad way. About a third of her face was badly burned. She’s finding it very tough and struggling to come to terms with it.

‘It’s really bad. We fear she’s going to be left really badly damaged. I have been with her at the hospital ever since it happened. We just have no idea why anyone would want to do this.’

A stain was still visible on the door of the two-storey terraced house in Romford, Essex, where she was attacked shortly after 9pm on Tuesday.

Miss Quigley, who neighbours say lived in the house with her sister and two young children, opened her front door to a man asking for ‘Michelle’.

He left, but returned half an hour later and threw an unidentified substance at her, believed to be acid.

She slammed the door and rushed to a sink where she washed her face with water.

Minutes later she was heard groaning in agony and calling out for help as she was taken to hospital by ambulance.

One neighbour, who declined to be named, said: ‘I had just had a shower and was about to go to bed.

‘I looked out and there were police 
cars and ambulances all over the street. I could hear the woman crying. 
She was groaning and shouting.’

Miss Quigley’s aunt, Carol Ferris, added: ‘We’re all in shock. No one knows why or what’s happened.

‘Tara is a lovely, bubbly girl, 
always smiling. I hope whoever did this to her gets what they deserve. 
No one deserves that treatment.’

Another neighbour described the 
Quigley sisters as ‘friendly and popular’. She said: ‘It was a busy 
house. They had a lot of friends come and visit. It was always quite 
lively.’

Detectives described the suspect as 
white, short, about 20 years old and was wearing black clothing.

Officers said that they were keeping 
an ‘open mind’ as to the motive for the attack. DC Paul Swift, from 
Romford CID, said: ‘This was a cowardly attack during which the victim 
suffered substantial injuries and I would appeal to anyone who may have 
witnessed this offence, seen a male loitering around the area before the
incident occurred or has knowledge of this matter to come forward.’

On Tuesday, a woman was charged with 
an unrelated acid attack on a shop worker. Naomi Oni, 21, suffered burns
and lost her hair and eyelashes during the attack in Dagenham, East 
London, last December.

An 
earlier version of this article stated that the attacker spoke with a 
foreign accent.  On 9 May a revised press release was issued by Scotland
Yard changing the attacker’s accent to English.  The article has been 
updated to reflect this.
