Kevin Pietersen accuses England of having a bullying culture and tries to portray himself as a victim in his autobiography that will become public on Monday.

Pietersen, shown the door by England when they finally had enough of his maverick ways after their humiliation in Australia, reserves his most stinging criticism for Matt Prior and Andy Flower in an extraordinary attack on England.

The first glimpse of what looks likely to be a rant against those who lost patience with him came in an interview with the Daily Telegraph.

Kevin Pietersen's autobiography is published on Monday and English cricket has eagerly awaited its release

It has long been known that Pietersen would aim his guns on Prior, a selfless team man who tried to broker a peace deal after Pietersen had sent derogatory texts about Andrew Strauss to South African opponents but who now finds himself accused of leading a concerted regime of bullying within the team.

‘Horrendous. Hugely disturbing,’ says Pietersen in the Telegraph of what he says was the culture within the England team when they rose to become the best in the world. 

‘I brought it up on numerous occasions. I told Andrew Strauss about it. I told Alastair Cook about it. It was a huge thing.

‘I could give you telephone numbers of international players around the world. You ring them and ask how the England team have conducted themselves over the last three or four years. People would say to me, “I can’t believe you could play with these guys?” 

Pietersen has taken aim at former coach  Flower ahead of his new autobiography which is released on Monday

MATT PRIOR

‘He’s a bad influence, a negative influence, he picks on players’

ANDY FLOWER

‘He didn’t like one of his soldiers to hammer him. He was the boss. He wanted me to fear him’

THE STRAUSS TEXTS

‘I regret being involved in conversations like that… I went to his house to apologise’

‘The bowlers were given so much power. They were doing really well but these guys ran the dressing room. The thing that horrified me most was when Strauss and Flower said before the one-day internationals in India, “Guys, we’ve got to stop this. It’s not right for the team. People have come to us who are intimidated to field the ball.”

‘And the bowlers had the audacity to stand there and say, “No, if they **** up we deserve an apology”. It’s the most angry I’ve ever got in the dressing room. I thought, “I reckon I could hit these guys.”

Pietersen stops short of hammering Alastair Cook, whom he calls ‘good at heart.’ But he cannot resist attacking Prior. ‘Alastair Cook isn’t the greatest speaker but his sidekick Matt Prior could talk the hind legs off a donkey. So Cook wanted Prior close to him. He wanted his vice-captain to do all his talking for him. So when I went after Prior I said he shouldn’t be in the team, he’s a bad influence, a negative influence, he picks on players.’

As expected, Pietersen attacks Flower even though England’s most successful coach was the man who gave him one last chance after he betrayed Strauss.

‘I’ve been one of the only ones who constantly through his reign as coach did not say “How high” when he said “Jump”. He built a regime, he didn’t build a team. 

'I told him on numerous occasions, “You’re playing by fear here, you want players to be scared of you. And Andy, I’m not scared of you”. And he hated it. 

'He had it in for me since I tried to get rid of him as second in command. Andy Flower didn’t like one of his soldiers to hammer him. He was the boss. He wanted me to fear him. I’ll never fear you buddy.’

There is one shock admission of regret over sending the messages about Strauss but he claims it was because he was ‘broken’ by a parody Twitter account mocking him.

He says his mistake was not disagreeing with the South Africans calling Strauss a ‘doos’, which, loosely translated, is the word Strauss called Pietersen when he was commenting for Sky this summer and thought he was off-air.

‘A doos is just an idiot and I regret being involved in conversations like that,’ Pietersen tells the Telegraph. ‘But mentally I was totally broken. I was crying in a room with Andy Flower during that Test (against South Africa at Headingley) saying, “How the hell has it come to this?”

‘Why? Because I was told by a senior player that the Twitter account was being run from inside the dressing room. I was completely broken, absolutely finished, mentally shot. Yes of course I regret getting Straussy involved and I went to his house to apologise. I apologised to his wife, too.’

Extraordinarily, Pietersen claims he still wants to play for England even though he made no attempt to play any first-class cricket for Surrey last summer and did not reach 60 in any Twenty20 innings in three competitions all year.

‘I know my issues are not just with the captain but with the board,’ he said. ‘If that changes — and I believe it could in the next few months — then I really believe I could play for England again.

‘The reason is that I honestly, 100 per cent believe I could I can help the youngsters and I believe I can help Cooky get better. I said to Andy Flower in that Ashes series, please, whenever you speak to Cooky, if he needs my help I’ll help him. I’m incredibly passionate about English cricket. I always want England to win.’

Pietersen has a funny way of showing it, that’s for sure.
