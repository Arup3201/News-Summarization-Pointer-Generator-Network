A Maine judge has ordered nurse Kaci Hickox to stay at least three feet from other people after she repeatedly defied the state's quarantine for medical workers who have treated Ebola patients.

Miss Hickox, who tested negative for the deadly virus earlier this week, went against the mandatory guidelines by going cycling with her partner Ted Wilbur and having a pizza delivered to their home.

But now, the 33-year-old has been temporarily ordered to remain a certain distance from others, avoid public places and stay in her hometown of Fort Kent in a bid to lessen the risk to the public.

Charles LaVerdiere, chief judge of the Maine District Court, instructed the nurse to submit to 'direct active monitoring' and 'not to be present in public places', except to receive necessary healthcare.

However, she is permitted to engage in 'non-congregate public activities', such as walking or jogging in a park, providing she maintains a three-foot distance from other people. 

It comes less than 24 hours after the Governor of Maine, Paul LePage, threatened to arrest Miss Hickox for defying her quarantine, saying: 'I don't want her within three feet of anyone.'

The court order, which sees the state follow through with its threat to try to isolate the nurse for 21 days, Ebola's incubation period, was made on Thursday.

It came in response to the state's request 'regarding the public health threat allegedly posed' by the nurse, said Judge LaVerdiere, but was issued only for 24 hours. Further action is due on Friday.

It is believed that the three-foot distance from others is only applicable to  Miss Hickox's public presence; so her interaction with Mr Wilbur inside their home will not be affected.

Miss Hickox, who was pictured beaming alongside Mr Wilbur as they received the pepperoni and mushroom pizza at their home on Thursday, maintains the quarantine violates her human rights.

She claims that she has no symptoms and poses no risk to the public after returning from treating critically ill Ebola patients in Sierra Leone, West Africa, a week ago.

As she returned home from the one-hour bike ride on Thu, the nurse said: 'There is no court action against me. There is nothing to stop me from going for a bike ride in my home town.' 

Police remained outside Miss Hickox's home on Friday, where they are closely monitoring the nurse's movements.

Fort Kent Police Chief Tom Pelletier went inside the house briefly on Friday morning and said afterward: 'We just had a good conversation.' He said he was not there to arrest or detain her.

The legal action is shaping up as the nation's biggest test case yet in the struggle to balance public health and fear of Ebola against personal freedom.

Miss Hickox stepped into the media glare when she returned from treating Ebola patients in Sierra Leone to become subject to a mandatory quarantine in New Jersey.

After being released from a hospital there, she returned to this small town, where she was placed under what Maine authorities called a voluntary quarantine.

She said she is following the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommendation of daily monitoring for fever and other signs of the disease.

'I'm not willing to stand here and let my civil rights be violated when it's not science-based,' she said on Wednesday evening.

Some states like Maine are going above and beyond the CDC guidelines to require quarantines. So is the U.S military.

President Barack Obama, the nation's top infectious-disease expert and humanitarian groups have warned that overly restrictive measures could cripple the fight against the disease at its source.

They claim such measures could discourage volunteers like Miss Hickox from going to West Africa, where the outbreak has sickened more than 13,000 people and killed nearly 5,000 of them.

'These kinds of restrictions could dissuade hundreds, if not thousands, of skilled volunteers from helping stop Ebola's spread, which is in the national interest of every one of our countries,' Samantha Power, U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, said Thursday in Brussels.

U.S. public concern about Ebola is high, even though only one person in the country is currently being treated for it, a New York doctor, Craig Spencer, who cared for patients in West Africa.

Spencer, 33, was in serious but stable condition, New York's Bellevue Hospital said on Thursday.
