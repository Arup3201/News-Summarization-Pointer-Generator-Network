Germany are strong favourites although it's always dangerous to write off Argentina... but who's got the better players?

Sportsmail expert Martin Keown has watched both teams several times during the tournament.

Here is his indispensable man-for-man analysis.

Making history? Germany could become the first European side to lift the World Cup in South America

One man band? Argentina may have to rely on the sublime talents of Lionel Messi (L) to win the tournament

GERMANY                                                                                 ARGENTINA

Such an imposing presence between the posts with a huge wingspan. he perfect physique for a goalkeeper and the game to go with it. Easily the world’s best goalkeeper

With
 goalkeepers it’s all in the mind, and though he didn’t play much for 
Monaco last season he has looked solid. A hero in the shootout and will 
be full of confidence.

Glove affair: Sergio Romero was a penalty shootout hero but Germany's keeper sweeper has the edge

You talk about strikers staying calm to score, but Lahm has a calmness in his defending. He trusts he can make challenges and his tackle on Marcelo was the best-timed challenge I’ve seen in the tournament.

Has
 taken his Premier League form to Brazil and done well. Struggled 
slightly against Nigeria’s Ahmed Musa but showed his tough side to carry
 on after taking a bad blow to the face against Holland.

Evenly matched: There is not much to choose between Philipp Lahm (L) and Pablo Zabaleta at right back

No airs and graces about Hummels. He’s brilliant in the air and, with two goals, is a threat from setpieces. Has arrogance and confidence, too, which I like.

He
 gets better protection than he does at Man City but he looks quicker 
and slicker than he did last season and thoroughly justifies his spot.

See you soon? Mats Hummels (L) and Martin Demichelis could face each other in Manchester next season

Jerome Boateng          7/10

Has played at right back but makes a far better centre half. Adds genuine pace in the middle alongside Hummels, is strong and also good with his distribution.

Solid
 centre back and with his extra speed he can help cover Demichelis so 
his partner doesn’t get isolated. Has just moved to Zenit St Petersburg 
for six million Euros, which seems a bargain.

Need for speed: Both Ezeuqiel Garay and Jerome Boateng have pace to support their defensive partners

Benedikt Hoewedes    6/10

Typifies his team’s ethic. Not a high-profile name but a no-frills defender.  I’ve barely seen him put a foot wrong. Efficient, intelligent and rarely beaten down his flank.

Bit
 of a mixed bag. Very quick and obviously likes to get forward but he 
still looks a little raw. Tenacious, though, and it takes a lot to get 
past him.

No frills: Neither Marcelo Rojo (L) or Benedikt Hoewedes are outstanding but they are rarely beaten

Bastian Schweinsteiger    8/10

With niggling injuries, he is almost forced to sit deeper rather than bomb forward. That improves the team shape. He is the heartbeat of the side with his range of passing and makes the side secure.

Does
 what Schweinsteiger does for the Germans. Happy to sit deep and has 
played a lot of football at centre half so has those defensive skills. 
Made a fantastic tackle on Robben and is key for Argentina.

Men in the middle: Javier Mascherano (L) and Bastian Schweinsteiger provide their side's midfield spine

A very interesting player. Can play a defensive role but likes to play clever passes and through balls. A real team player in the final third - if there is a team-mate better placed, he will find them.

Another
 hard worker who likes to sit alongside Mascherano. Has a big 
responsibility in there but is a tidy and bullish player. Gets through a
 lot of work andpasses well.

Water carriers: Sami Khedira (L) and Lucas Biglia take care of the less glamorous sides of work

My player of the tournament. Has been playing two roles - he can join Miroslav Klose in the middle or if his midfielders stay central he drifts wide to the right. An exceptional young forward.

Had
 a decent game against Holland, is a good runner with the ball and happy
 to sling crosses in if he can’t go for goal. Has plenty of energy and 
helped ease the loss of Angel di Maria.

No contest: Thomas Muller (R) is shooting for the Golden Boot while Enzo Perez is second choice

Good passing and even better vision. Can switch the game from simple five-yard passes to sweeping switches of play if things are tight. And give him space on either foot and he’ll smash one in.

A
 very probing player who always tests defenders. Isn’t happy unless he’s
 taking on people. Holland’s Bruno Martins Indi had to come off because 
he couldn’t deal with his pace.

Different strokes: Toni Kroos (R) is Germany's pass master while Ezequiel Lavezzi has pace to burn

Has had a relatively quiet tournament but by not doing much he keeps a good shape for the team. Invariably parks himself on the left to occupy defenders and helps the structure of the side.

Fitting
 stage for the world’s best player. Finally has the chance to lead his 
country out and be the match winner. One of the game’s best players up 
against the tournament’s best team.

String pullers: Lionel Messi and Arsenal's Mesut Ozil will orchestrate play from the midfield

He gives the team a better balance with the positions he takes up. He, Ozil and Schweinsteiger stay fixed while the rest of the midfield flows around them.

Took
 him a while to come to the party but that vital goal gave him a lift. 
Has improved his play and, with him up top, it helps Argentina to get 
the best out of Messi.

Forward thinking: Gonzalo Higuain and record breaker Miroslav Klose will lead their respective lines in Brazil

Comes on to good effect and really adds to the team with his running and finishing.

Plagued by injury so not quite the Aguero of old but what a player to have on your bench.

Will be disappointed not to feature more, but he’s a quality player.

I
 have a feeling he might play some part. So important for Argentina with
 his direct approach. May try to time his fitness for the final like one
 of his runs.

An outstanding sub to call upon if needed.

Super sub? Sergio Aguero could make an impact from the bench after recovering from injury

Bench mark: Bayern Munich schemer Mario Gotze will be disappointed not to start

Not impressed with his hair but he has been useful coming off the bench.

Found it tough in some games but still provides excellent defensive cover.

Another fighter who gives them some tactical flexibility in midfield.

A talented youngster and his appearance against Brazil almost felt like a reward.

Lost his place to Demichelis, but gives good cover at the back.

In reserve: Per Mertesacker (R) and Andre Schurlle provide superb options for Joachim Low's germany

Has grown through the tournament and not been afraid to tweak things in the search for answers. Moved Lahm from midfield to full back, changed his centre half pairing and has used Klose well.

After that semi-final performance you can’t expect many changes because they seem to have found the best balance and are peaking at the right time.

Can
 be a bit of a drama queen on the sideliness but he’s been tactically 
astute. His team virtually picks itself but he has made tweaks to 
improve it. He might have catered to Messi’s needs, but credit to him 
for getting the best out of his star man in an Argentina shirt.

Gaffers: Germany boss Joachim Low (L) has more experience on the big stage than Alejandro Sabella

Best of both worlds: Only three Argentina players make it into Martin Keown's composite XI

It’s a tough task picking from these squads but the Germans clearly have the superior back five. I’d pick Mascherano ahead of Schweinsteiger because he’s had the edge in this tournament.

If Di Maria were fit, I’d certainly put him in for Ozil, though Lavezzi could work there too. I’d put Messi at the top of the pitch where he can do the most damage.

All three Argentines would have to keep their shape, though, because that’s what Schweinsteiger, Ozil and Klose do so well for their team.
