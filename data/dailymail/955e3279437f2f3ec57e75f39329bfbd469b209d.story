Leicester City are edging closer to the signing of Andrej Kramaric with the Croatian striker undertaking a medical at the club on Tuesday.

Kramaric, 23, arrived in Leicester for the next stage of his £9million deal from Rijeka after Chelsea fell behind in their bid following an inability to offer the player a place in their squad next season.

Nigel Pearson is keen to bolster his squad in the January transfer window to battle against Barclays Premier League relegation and getting the deal for Kramaric would represent a coup.

Kramaric has 28 goals in 31 games for Rijeka this season and two goals from four caps for Croatia.

The arrival of the forward will aid the Foxes' firepower this season as they look to climb off the bottom of the Premier League table.

Leicester have managed to collect just 14 points from 20 games so far, scoring 19 goals along the way. Pearson's side host Aston Villa in the league on Saturday.
