An unprecedented number of children are being prescribed strong anti-psychotic medication, sometimes by doctors who have little experience in dealing with child psychiatric experience.

New figures revealed by the ABC show that more than 100,000 scripts were written for children around Australian for such medications in the past year.

In Queensland the figures were highest with 645 in 100,000 children on a form of anti-psychotic, according to statistic from the year 2013.

NSW had the second highest rate, followed by the ACT and Victoria. Figures were lower in West Australia, the Northern Territory, South Australia and Tasmania. 

New figures have revealed that young more than 100,000 Australian children have been prescribed anti-psychotic medication 

In 2012, the Australian Federal Government estimated that at least 12,000 children were on anti-psychotic medication, the ABC reported, but that figure appears to be much higher now.

Risperidone, Quetiapine and Olanzapine are the three most commonly prescribed medicines. 

Such medications are primarily used to treat conditions like bipolar and schizophrenia which don't emerge until the late teenage years, but these are increasingly being used to control some symptoms of autism or kids who exhibit particularly aggressive behaviour. 

Child psychiatrist Jon Jureidini has criticised the overuse of such medications, saying that more children are prescribed with anti-psychotic medication than the number of them who actually suffer from psychotic disorders.

One doctor said an alarming number of children in foster care are being prescribed anti-psychotic medication for behavioural problems

'We should make no mistake about these drugs – they are dangerous drugs,' he said, adding that they can cause many side-effects including weight gain.

He added that an alarming number of children in foster care are being prescribed anti-psychotic medication for behavioural problems.

'I think we have to face up to the fact that children in foster care are being inappropriately overmedicated,' Dr Jureidini said. 

Dr Jureidini also said there is little evidence to support the use of such medications are safe in young children, and described their use as largely experimental. 

He urged people to seek alternative treatment like psychology before reaching for potentially harmful medications.
