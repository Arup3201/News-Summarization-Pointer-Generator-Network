A young girl left severely brain-damaged from salmonella poisoning after eating a KFC chicken twister is in danger of losing her $8million award after lawyers appealed today.

Sydney girl Monika Samaan, who is now 14, became so ill seven years ago she could not speak and will be confined to a wheelchair for the rest of her life.

Her parents said the money would be a great help for her ongoing care – but lawyers for the fast food giant said it had filed papers contesting the court’s finding and the award.

The appeal places Miss Samaan in 
danger of losing all or part of the money - and could also result in her
family having to pay a fortune in legal costs.

Fairfax Media in Australia said it 
understood KFC was also trying to force Miss Samaan and her family to 
pay its legal costs from her 2009 court hearing, which are expected to 
amount to hundreds of thousands of pounds.

KFC denied it was responsible for Miss
Samaan’s brain damage but during the court hearing a number of poor 
hygiene practices were revealed at the store in the suburb of Villawood 
where the family purchased their chicken meals.

In April this year, three years after 
the initial hearing, Justice Stephen Rothman found in favour of the 
family and ordered KFC to pay the £5 million compensation.

But lawyers for the company told the 
NSW Surpreme Court today that they have formal lodged appeal 
submissions, based on three factors.

They said the appeal included claims 
that there had been a ‘failure to consider evidence’ during the initial 
hearing, an ‘error in the judge’s factual findings’ and an error in the 
weight given to certain evidence.

Through their own lawyers, the Samaan 
family immediately hit back at KFC’s appeal submissions, saying they 
were ‘an amorphous restatement’ of what had been said during the trial.

It is understood that with the appeal 
pending the Samaan family, who live in a modest home in Sydney, have not
received any of the award money.

When the judge announced the award in April, family lawyer George Vlahakis said the compensation was ‘very much needed.’

He added: ‘Monika’s severe brain damage and severe disability has already exhausted the very limited resources of the family.’

During the initial hearing the court 
heard that after dining at KFC Miss Samaan and her brother both ended up
in hospital, but she was left significantly the worse of the two.

Referring to Miss Samaan’s parents, Mr
Vlahakis said: ‘Monika is now a big girl and they are finding it 
increasingly difficult to lift her and to look after her basic needs as 
well as look after Monika’s younger siblings.’
