A young mother who was blinded when her violent boyfriend gouged out both her eyes during a 12-hour attack has described in horrific detail the moment she felt her eyeball 'hanging down my cheek.'

Tina Nash has relived the ordeal at the hands of cowardly Shane Jenkin, who beat her unconscious and poked out her eyes while she was asleep at her home in Cornwall.

She woke up 'smothered in blackness' to find the 18st thug squeezing her neck until 'my head felt like it was going to explode' and passed out three times in quick succession.

He continued throttling her to the 
point where she had an 'out-of-body experience' where she thought she 
could see her neighbours shouting at him to stop.

The
 mother-of-two said: 'I came round the fourth time to the sound of 
gargling, the horrible sound of someone taking their last breath. Then I
 realised it was coming from me. I was so close to death my toes were 
curling in spasms.'

Jenkin 
finally stopped when she summoned the strength to force herself out from
 under the duvet to declare that she still loved him.

He told her that her eye was hanging out of her head and shouted: 'You're blind! You're never going to see your kids again.'

In
 extracts from her new book Out Of The Darkness published in the Sunday 
Mirror, Miss Nash said: 'I sat up and reached my hand to my face... and 
felt my eyeball hanging halfway down my cheek.

'I touched my slippery eyeball, like I couldn't believe it was real. My other eye was swollen to the size of a tennis ball.'

All the time, Jenkin was screaming that it was her fault and continued the terrifying attack by dunking her head in the bath.

Thug: Jenkin was handed an inderterminate prison sentence in a mental hospital after admitting grievous bodily harm earlier this year

Her
 eyes felt like they had been prodded with a red hot poker, said Miss 
Nash, whose sons Ben, 13, and Liam three, were sleeping in the same 
house.

Ignoring
 her desperate pleas to call an ambulance, Jenkin kept her imprisoned 
for 12 hours until he eventually let her eldest son get help.

In May this year, Jenkin, 33, was 
handed an indeterminate sentence with a minimum of six years, which he 
will serve in a mental hospital, after admitting grievous bodily harm 
with intent.

Ten years 
before the couple started dating Miss Nash met Jenkins briefly but 
recalls a friend warning her he was a 'psycho'.

But when they met up 
again in a Penzance night club he seemed to have 'grown up' and was 
charming.

It didn't take long for his 'evil' side to come out Miss Nash said and eight months into the relationship he turned violent.

The first time he physically attacked her she had been in her bedroom asleep, while he was downstairs with her friend.

She
 was woken and went downstairs to find the friend in just her underwear 
with him. As way of explanation, Jenkins punched Miss Nash in the face 
three times.

She hid 
under the duvet but he jumped on her ‘and stuck his thumbs in my eyes’ 
for first time. That time she had managed to fend him off but not before
 he had thrown her down the stairs.

Regular
 beatings and attempts to strangle her followed. Miss Nash said she 
tried to get away from him but went back out of fear of what he might do
 next.

Chillingly 
Miss Nash said his face and eyes changed when he attacked her. They were
 ‘black, nothing there - no emotion,' she revealed previously in an interview on ITV's This Morning.

On
 the dreadful night in April last year, the couple had been watching the
 horror film Hostel, in which a woman has her eyes gouged out.

They
 then had a dispute after Jenkins tried to hand his neighbour some 
sleeping tablets resulting in Miss Nash going up to bed alone at her 
home in Hayle, Cornwall.

He
 later beat her unconscious in her sleep. ‘That's when he done my eyes,'
 Miss Nash said. 'When I came round he was trying to strangle me and 
knocked me unconscious.

The horrific attack only stopped when she told Jenkins she was 'sorry' and that she loved him.

‘That's when he said: “Your eyes are
 hanging out your head, you'll never see your kids again, I'm going to 
get 20 years for this”.

Miss
 Nash had several operations over four weeks of hospital treatment but 
surgeons could not save her eyes. Jenkin had pushed one so far in it had
 burst, Miss Nash recalled.

She
 now wears a prosthetic eye in her left socket but wears sunglasses. Losing her sight 
felt like being buried alive, she said.

‘I felt so ill inside,' she said. 'I felt like I was going to die at any second.’

It
 was her two sons that kept Miss Nash going and she says she is now 
happy at home but wants to highlight the dangers of a violent partner.
