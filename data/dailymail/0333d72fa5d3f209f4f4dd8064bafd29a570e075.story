An Air France flight from Dublin to Paris made an emergency landing in Birmingham after its windscreen cracked while in the air.

The crack formed shortly after the Avro RJ85 departed Dublin Airport for Paris’ Charles de Gaulle Airport on Sunday evening.

After crossing the Irish Sea the plane changed its course over Wales as the pilot reported the problem around 6:30pm.
