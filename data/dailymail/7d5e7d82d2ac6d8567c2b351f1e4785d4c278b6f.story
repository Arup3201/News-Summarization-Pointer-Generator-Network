From idyllic beaches to spectacular scenery, there isn’t much that Haiti doesn’t offer tourists.

But this is one activity that isn't on most visitors’ itineraries.

Bullfighting is a huge pastime for Haitians, with locals often gathering each Sunday to gamble on the outcome of matches.

In the coastal town of Leogane, locals often gather each Sunday to gamble on the outcome bullfights

The coastal town of Leogane holds regular events, and the obscure Haitian practice has been likened to cockfighting or dog-fighting.

A casual pastime for some rural men, it's a serious business for others looking to pay their children's school fees or even buy a car.

The animals’ horns are often sharpened by knives and machetes ahead of each fight in a bid to give the bulls an advantage over their rivals.

The bulls' trainers then stomp through crowds of onlookers as they look to drum up bets among the spectators, while the animals dig holes in the dirt as they wait to be let loose from their ropes.

Locals say most fights end when one of the bulls retreats, but some have ended with one of the animals - or spectators - being gored

When owners are satisfied with the bets, two bulls are released to charge into a bone-rattling collision.

Lunging at one another and digging their hooves into the soil, the 1,700lb animals battle while hundreds of spectators shout and wave money.

While some fights last a matter of minutes, other can continue for a quarter of an hour.

Bettors say their decision to pick a specific bull to win a fight can often involves dreamlike visions

The fight ends when one of the bulls retreats. 

While locals reveal that this is the most likely ending to a fight, some have ended with one of the animals - or spectators - being gored.

Local Jean Andre Martineau says he has managed to buy a large Jeep with the winnings he has collected from his four fighting bulls.

‘The happiness is in betting on an animal you know is strong and ready,’ he said outside Leogane, an hour's drive from Port-au-Prince.

The 72-year-old said his great-grandfather was a well-known bull trainer and the practice has existed in several rural hamlets for at least a century.

It fits into a gambling culture in Haiti that includes cock fights and ‘borlettes’ - gaudily-painted outlets that sell lottery tickets.
