After more than a week of mystery and intrigue surrounding the Maryland Mega Millions jackpot, it appears that we have a winner, but who is it?

The holder of the winning ticket, sold in a Milford Mill 7-Eleven store has claimed their share of the record-breaking $656million prize today, but will remain anonymous.

Maryland Lottery spokeswoman Carole Everett said that the winner claimed the prize at lottery headquarters with a ticket matching all six numbers: 2-4-23-38-46 and the Mega Ball, 23.

Mystery: The Milford, Maryland, 7-Eleven store is proudly displaying that they sold one of the winning tickets but the identity of the winner is not known

The winner will remain anonymous, but officials will share some details at a news conference Tuesday morning, she said.

Maryland does not require lottery winners to be identified.

The burning question emerging from the announcement is whether the big winner is McDonald's worker Mirlande Wilson, who grabbed headlines as well as outrage when she publicly announced that she had the winning ticket – and, despite entering the drawing with co-workers, was not sharing it.

Ms Wilson told NBC that she gave all of her co-workers the copies of the tickets for the pool and the winning ticket was not among them.

Mega bucks: The jackpot was the biggest in Mega Millions history, and the three winners - one each in Maryland, Illinois and Kansas - will each receive more than $218million before taxes

Instead she claims to have sent a friend to buy more tickets later that day and the winning one was among them.

'McDonald's don't have nothing to do with this,' she insisted. 'They don't have nothing to do with - they don't even know about it and they don't even have nothing to do with this. It's only us by ourself [sic].'

She then went on to say it was in a safe place at an undisclosed location before saying it was at the McDonald’s in which she worked. She later claimed that she had lost it.

She is leaving the discovery of the ticket in the hands of God: 'It’s a blessing from God. If it’s meant to be, we’ll [find and] claim the ticket'.

Lost it: Mirlande Wilson said last week that she can't find the winning Mega Millions ticket but hasn't really looked for it properly and thinks God will help to find it if it's meant to be

Proof? Mirlande Wilson showed a reporter the copies of the pooled tickets she shared with her McDonald's employees and said the winning ticket was not among them - though would not say where it was

But the mother-of-seven's co-workers doubted her story was the truth.

Another colleague told the New York Post: 'I don’t believe her. I didn’t believe her from the beginning, she’s always been strange.

'She’s an attention seeker. She likes to have all the attention on herself'.

On her Facebook page, Ms Wilson has pledged to donate all of the winnings to rebuild her earthquake-devastated native Haiti.

She wrote: 'All my true friend know im not greedy a person [sic] i don't want da money it made my life a living hell already im gonna give it all to rebuild haiti yall [sic] can chase all want my life and, my children it more important for money [sic]'.

Ms Wilson’s attorney did not immediately return a call seeking comment Monday evening.

The jackpot was the biggest in Mega Millions history, and the three winners - one each in Maryland, Illinois and Kansas - will each receive more than $218million before taxes.

Kansas' winner claimed a share of the jackpot Friday, but also decided to remain anonymous.

Lottery players waited in long lines to buy tickets as the jackpot gradually climbed, leaving millions of losers to grumble about their misfortune and dream of what they would have done with all that money.

Maryland has been the home of Mega Millions winners in the past.

In 2007, Ellwood ‘Bunky’ Bartlett won roughly $27million after taxes.
