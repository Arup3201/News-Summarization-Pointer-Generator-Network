A group of Eastern European builders have been found living in portable cabins while working on a multi-million pound redevelopment in central Manchester.

The six Latvian men, who have been spotted walking around the site topless during the day, will now be removed from outside Jactin House after residents complained of late-night drinking and anti-social behaviour.

The Homes and Communities Agency (HCA) said it is considering legal action against Manchester-based developers Northern Group after it was made aware of the situation at the property - which is being transformed into office space.

Manchester Central MP Lucy Powell said she would be seeking answers as to how the situation had been allowed on a government site. 

She said: 'Workers shouldn’t have to live in these conditions and residents shouldn’t have to put up with this disturbance after hours.

'This shouldn’t happen on any site, let alone one funded through a government agency.

'I’ll be getting in touch with the agencies involved to get to the bottom of this. Action needs to be taken to rectify this situation for all concerned.'

Six Latvian workers have been observed living in portable cabins in the car park of the derelict site on Hood Street over the last four weeks.

The HCA-owned former mill workers’ hostel is undergoing a £5million transformation to accommodate new businesses - funded by the European Regional Development Fund.

A HCA spokesman said: 'The Homes and Communities Agency strongly opposes the unsanctioned use of Jactin House as a temporary place of residency during the construction period, which breaches the terms of Northern Group’s lease.

Anger: Residents have complained that the men are involved in anti-social behaviour and late-night drinking

'We are taking action to put a stop to this, and are reviewing our legal options.'

After being told of the HCA’s response Northern Group said it would take immediate action and be removing the workers by Monday. 

Councillor Bernard Priest said: 'The city council does not encourage, nor does it condone developers allowing their contractors to live on-site.'

Work on the site is expected to be completed next summer. Once completed the five-storey building will house office space as well as community facilities, including a gym and a nursery.

Sean Wood, construction manager of Ancoats-based developer Northern Group, said the company would find new accommodation for the workers. 

Action: The Homes and Communities Agency (HCA) have said they will take legal action against the Northern Group, the builders' employers, after they were made aware of the situation 

He said: 'One of the subcontractor teams working on this site are living in Health and Safety Executive approved accommodation supplied by Oldham-based company Bunkabin. 

'This kind of accommodation is used across Europe and very similar to that used by workers on London’s Olympic Park.

'Our subcontractors have expressed no dissatisfaction with the standard of accommodation whatsoever.

'However, it has been brought to our attention that the HCA believes the use of these cabins to contravene the terms of our lease and we will act on this immediately and find new accommodation for the six workers affected.

'We would like to add that late night noise on our site is unacceptable to us and all complaints are dealt with immediately.'
