Ronald Koeman will want his side to perform well at the Emirates Stadium on Wednesday night - but maybe not that well.

The high-flying Saints face an Arsenal side who have been struggling to maintain their top-four credentials so far this term.

The Gunners have spent very little time in the Champions League positions but victory will certainly go some way to achieving that, against a team which has produced a number of their top talent in recent years

Arsene Wenger has signed three players from Southampton for a combined £35million. They are:

Theo Walcott - Signed for £9m in January 2006

Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain - Signed for £12m in August 2011

Calum Chambers - Signed for £12m in July 2014

Wenger was also interested in signing these three players from the Saints:

Gareth Bale - Moved to Tottenham Hotspur for £7m in May 2007 (before leaving for Real Madrid in a world-record £86m deal in September 2013)

Luke Shaw - Moved to Manchester United for £31m in June 2014

Morgan Schneiderlin - Still at St Mary's 

Arsenal's talent spotters have traditionally found St Mary's a happy hunting ground.

Theo Walcott, Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain and Calum Chambers have all arrived in north London from the south coast in recent years.

There could have been more: Gareth Bale, Luke Shaw and Morgan Schneiderlin have been on Arsene Wenger's radar at one time or another.

Speaking in 2012, Arsenal manager Wenger said: 'The question of Southampton's academy set-up is a very good one because they have done a fabulous job.

'Why? It is down to the quality of their scouting, the quality of their coaching and education. When you look at what Bale is doing, and Walcott.

'And now they have they players like Morgan Schneiderlin, they have brought some players of top, top quality and they work well. They have fantastic scouting.'

Glowing praise, indeed. No wonder Arsenal have kept such a close eye on Southampton's talent pool.

Having already won at the Emirates Stadium this season, albeit in the Capital One Cup, victory on Wednesday will confirm Koeman side as bona-fide Champions League contenders.

And while Arsenal have never been out of touch with the top four, they are yet to stake a firm claim in the elite pack so far this season. 

Wednesday night is a big test for both clubs in north London.

Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain swapped St Mary's for the Emirates when he moved for £12m in August 2011

Calum Chambers also moved from the Saints to Arsenal for a £12million sum last summer

Let's face it, we all expect the wheels to come off at some point between now and the end of the season for Southampton. 

The Saints were heavily tipped to struggle this season following the much-publicised summer exodus of their top players.

Relegation was even mentioned in some circles, a thought those who made such assumptions would never admit. But the quality of their scouting system has shone through once more.

Arsenal also tried to sign Luke Shaw (left), who moved to Manchester United for £30million last summer and Morgan Schneiderlin, who remains at St Mary's Stadium and has excelled so far this season

And what if Arsenal come knocking again? There's plenty on offer at St Mary's.

Graziano Pelle arrived as Rickie Lambert's replacement and was hardly a household name on these shores.

However, speak to some of Pelle's Saints team-mates today and they'll tell you the Italian is an upgrade on Lambert. Nine goals since his arrival in England tells its own story.

Dusan Tadic was signed as Adam Lallana's replacement. Again, not a name many Barclays Premier League followers would know much about.

Ronald Koeman has impressed as manager so far and will look to continue his good work against Arsenal

Graziano Pelle has been an excellent signing for Southampton so far this season, scoring nine times

They definitely do now, though; the Serb's pace, skill and intelligence down Southampton's left has been a key feature of Koeman's attacking blueprint.

Ryan Bertrand replaced Luke Shaw at left back and Saints fans have hardly noticed the £31m man's departure.

Even the decision to allow Chambers to leave for Arsenal was part of a grand plan: to allow Nathaniel Clyne to fully establish himself as the club's first-choice right back.

He's not only accomplished that task, but he is now, arguably, England's first-choice right back.

And following an astonishing run of 11 wins in 12 games, Southampton found themselves in the top four last month.

Those who doubted how they'd cope without Lallana, Shaw, Lambert and Chambers were eating their words. But two games without a win has once again cast doubt on Southampton.

So while the south coast pretenders occupy a seat at the top table they must fear they'll lose more talent to the likes of Arsenal if they maintain their remarkable start to the season.
