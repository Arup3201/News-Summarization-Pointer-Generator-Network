Jeffrey Neyle McAllister, 38, a former police officer,  was arrested on multiple sex assault charges on Wednesday, amid accusations he abused women at the Legacy Emanuel Medical Center emergency room,  in Portland

A patient who claims she was raped by a male nurse has spoken of her anger that it apparently took police four months to investigate, allowing her alleged abuser to 'attack again'.

Jeffrey Neyle McAllister, 38, a former police officer,  has pleaded not guilty in Multnomah County Circuit Court .

He was faced with an 11-count indictment accusing him of raping a patient at Legacy Emanuel Medical Centre's ER, in Portland, Oregon, in January, and sexually abusing two other patients in February and last September

The Portland Police Bureau investigation only began when a patient came forward in April 2013.

One of this alleged victims claims she told police months earlier, in January, that she had been raped by the nurse.

Susan Graham waived her anonymity to speak out about her outrage that police 'mishandling' of her complaint, could mean that others were also attacked.

She told Oregon Live that she was not only devastated by her alleged attack but furious that it took four months for police to follow up on her complaint.

She claims the nurse made comments about the patterns on her underwear and physical appearance, including complimenting her on her 'narrow hips' while she was undergoing treatment at the hospital. She said he practically carried her into a bathroom because she was unable to walk, to give a urine sample. She was then raped, she says.

She said she left the Legacy Emanuel ER the night of January 15, and two days later went to a different hospital, Providence Portland Medical Centre, to make a complaint and undergo examinations. 

She told the paper that it was not until April that she returned home to find a Portland detective's card waiting for her and asking her to contact police.

She said: 'I'm upset because it happened again to someone else after me. I'm appalled on how the police handled my complaint.'

Police confirmed that Ms Graham had made a report of sexual assault on January 17, but did not know what exactly her allegations were, and if they were reviewed or acted upon.

They did admit to the paper that there was a gap between her initial complaint and any subsequent follow up.

Ms Graham, a recovering opiate addict, said she believed that police had not taken her complaint seriously because she has a criminal conviction for driving under the influence of intoxicants and first-degree burglary convictions in 2012.

She said: 'I'm upset because it happened again, and it happened once before me, and the police knew.'

He has been accused of abusing women at the Legacy Emanuel Medical Center emergency room,  in Portland, Oregon, where he worked as an emergency room nurse

Legacy Emanuel Medical Center dismissed McAllister in April after being made aware of the police inquiry, a hospital spokesman said.

He is charged with two counts of first-degree rape, four counts of first-degree sodomy and two counts of first-degree sexual abuse in relation to the alleged January 15 assault against Graham, the indictment says.

It also accuses McAllister of first-degree and second-degree sexual abuse of a patient who was who was 'mentally incapacitated and physically helpless' on February 14, and he is also accused of third-degree sexual abuse last September 24, having allegedly touched the breast of another patient.

A police spokesman said : 'The 
Portland Police Bureau investigation began when a patient came forward 
in April 2013, regarding allegations that McAllister inappropriate 
sexual contact in the Emanuel Hospital ER. Subsequent investigation and 
assistance from Investigator Jessica Van Horn of the Oregon State Board 
of Nursing (OSBN), made detectives aware of additional victims.
