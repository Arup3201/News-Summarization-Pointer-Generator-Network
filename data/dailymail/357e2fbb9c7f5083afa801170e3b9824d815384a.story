A UK Independence Party election candidate has been suspended from the party after being caught on camera apparently making a Nazi salute – bringing further scandal to the party ahead of Thursday’s local elections.

UKIP leader Nigel Farage admitted the latest revelations about members 'doesn't look very pretty' as he was again forced on to the back foot over the failure to vet people standing in this week's local elections.

The latest photo to emerge is of Alex Wood, candidate for Blackmore Vale in Somerset, which was posted on Facebook, along with racist comments. In another picture, part of a series of images, the 22-year-old clenches a knife between his teeth against a backdrop of the Union Flag.

UKIP said Mr Wood's party membership 'was suspended pending the police investigation' after pictures and comments emerged online.

Comments saying that Africans ‘lived in mud huts’ and ‘kill each other’ also appeared under his name on the Facebook page, but he told the Mail last night that he ‘categorically denies’ posting them.

He said: ‘My account has been hijacked – by that I mean someone, somehow, has gained access to my Facebook and posted personal pictures of me without me knowing.

'Claims that I am a racist are categorically untrue and all comments of a racist nature on Facebook were not posted by me.’

A string of revelations about UKIP candidates have dogged the party ahead of Thursday's elections.

It also emerged that John Sullivan, a UKIP candidate in Gloucestershire, is alleged to have made the homophobic comments on Facebook.

He is said to have claimed that regular exercise 'prevents' children from 'becoming' gay.

He also suggested the Victorian method of physical exercise 'released tension and thus avoided homosexuality', but it was unclear whether these are Mr Sullivan's views or whether he was just talking about Victorian attitudes to sport and homosexuality.

James Carver, UKIP agent for the Forest of Dean and West Gloucestershire, confirmed he will continue to stand for election on Thursday.

Mr Farage was again forced to admit the party does not have the resources to check the backgrounds of everyone standing for election on a UKIP ticket.

Challenged about the pictures of Mr Wood, Mr Farage said: 'That doesn’t look very pretty, I agree with you, and we have had, out of out 17,000 candidates, a handful that have embarrassed us, most of them because they simply haven’t told us the truth.

'We’re the only party in British politics who actually forbid former members of the British National Party or extreme organisation from even becoming members of UKIP, let alone candidates, and in one or two cases, people haven’t told us the truth, but I’m pleased to say it is only a handful,' he told BBC Radio 4.

Mr Farage also courted controversy when he referred to 'coloured people' during an interview to reject claims UKIP supporters are racist.

Party aides later stressed he was referring to comments made by former Tory councillor John Cherry, who resigned last week after suggesting inner-city children from a ‘coloured area’ would not be welcome at a proposed new school in the countryside.

Pollsters predict UKIP could make major gains in Thursday's elections of between 50 and 100 seats.

But the campaign drive has been over-shadowed by revelations about some of the party's candidates.

Mr Wood defended the photograph of him raising his left arm, insisting it was in fact a picture of him at a Christmas party reaching for his friend’s camera after she had taken pictures of him ‘trying to eat from a tree’.

‘It sounds stupid, I know,’ he said. ‘But it’s true.’

He added: ‘I do not wish to say anything else as it is being investigated by police.’

Mr Farage last night came under pressure to suspend Mr Wood.

UKIP suspended 24-year-old Chris Scotton, a candidate in Leicester, at the weekend after it was revealed he backed online groups with racist views.

The release of the image also comes after a series of other humiliating incidents for the party, including a UKIP candidate being investigated by police over allegations of electoral fraud.

Northumbria Police said officers were investigating a report of alleged electoral fraud in the Cowpen area of Blyth.

Detective Inspector David Brown said 
on Sunday: ‘We can confirm that we have received a complaint... We are 
in the early stages of the investigation.’

Last week UKIP were also forced to respond to a series of revelations about candidates’ racist pasts.

Others are accused of making homophobic comments or saying that vigilantes should kill paedophiles.

And on Saturday UKIP MEP Godfrey 
Bloom sparked fresh controversy when he repeated his call for company 
bosses not to employ women of child-bearing age.

Branding maternity rights ‘draconian’, he said: ‘I would say be very, very careful indeed what that young woman has to offer.

‘If I wanted a receptionist or a 
dental nurse, I would be thinking very carefully about the age of that 
woman because she has to turn up at nine o’clock every morning. This 
isn’t rocket science.’

It comes after veteran Tory Cabinet 
minister Ken Clarke claimed UKIP voters are racists and said the party's
 politicians are clowns.

Mr Clarke said UKIP is merely a protest party and those attracted to it are ‘waifs and strays’ who are simply ‘against’ foreigners and immigrants.

Recent polls showed that Nigel Farage’s Eurosceptic party has overtaken the Liberal Democrats and is set for its best local election results ever on Thursday, when 35 county councils and unitary authorities in England and one in Wales go to the polls.
