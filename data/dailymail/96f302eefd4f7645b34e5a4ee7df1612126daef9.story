Criminal act: Zain Iqbal, left, has been jailed for 28 months today at Manchester Crown Court for the injuries Wei Liu and others suffered. The new mother only met her son Lucas when he was three days old after her coma

Medical care: Wei Liu with a sleeping Lucas in Manchester Royal Infirmary shortly after the horrific accident

Iqbal was speeding on Great Ancoats Street in Manchester when he attempted to undertake a car that had slowed down to allow a taxi to pull out, only to plough into the cab.

Ms Liu was taken to Manchester Royal Infirmary in a critical condition and her son Lucas was delivered after an emergency caesarean a month early.

Victim: Her partner Geng Liu with baby Lucas, who was warned after the crash he might have to choose between his girlfriend's life or his son's

She was also left with a catalogue of devastating injuries, including a severed artery above her heart, fractured ribs which had pierced her liver and a shattered pelvis along with a fractured cheekbone, broken foot and a gash on her head which needed 48 stitches.

The shop assistant for Hermes in Selfridges in Manchester city centre also had to spend a total of 40 days in hospital before finally being allowed home. She is still in a wheelchair.

In Miss Liu's victim impact statement 
she said: 'I'm still having medical treatment and still trying to 
recover from the injuries. I still have treatment for my head injury. I 
get dizzy when I try and sleep I need to take sleeping tablets. I 
constantly have headaches and I still have a bleed on the brain.

'I
 still have pain to my heart, it starts like heartburn, I have to have a
 scan every year for my heart injury. I am very emotional, at first I 
thought it was my hormones with having my son Lucas. There is still not a
 bond, there seems to be no connection, like you can take him away and 
no bond would be broken. It is very upsetting. I have no memory of 
giving birth. He is doing fine and is a healthy baby.

'I
 have a large scar on my scalp which needed 48 stitches and a 10- 12 cm 
scar on my stomach. I have a scar on my left cheek which I have to 
constantly cover up with make up. Since the collision I haven't gone 
back to work. It would not be possible as I am unable to stand for too 
long and get tired very easily. The crash has ruined my life and the 
start of my family life.'

New born: Lucas Liu sleeps in hospital - where his mother stayed for 40 days after the crash

In a wheelchair: Ms Liu was taken to Manchester Royal Infirmary in a critical condition and her son Lucas was delivered after an emergency caesarean a month early

Happy ending: The trio all survived the horror crash but Wei Liu is still in a wheelchair nine months on

Her partner Geng needed surgery for a punctured lung, broken ribs and also suffered injuries to his feet. A pedestrian was also injured in the accident after being crushed between the taxi and a barrier.

Today Iqbal, who is studying for an accountancy degree at Manchester Metropolitan University, was jailed for 28 months and banned from driving for four years at court.

He had earlier pleaded guilty to causing serious injury by dangerous driving and also had to pay a Â£120 victim surcharge.

Emergency: Some of Wei's stitches after the crash. She says she still has headaches and says what happened has ruined her life

At court prosecutor Brian Berlyne said a witness spotted the VW Golf being driven at speed behind him.

Mr Berlyne said: 'He described Mr Iqbal as "blasting past him" and driving at excessive speed. He described him as wobbling along all over the place and looked unsteady.

'A short distance ahead travelling in the same direction was Nicola Ferney who observed the black cab travelling in the opposite direction.

'She heard a loud revving noise and saw that Mr Iqbal had overtaken her on her nearside. In her words it was quite fast and then the driver was in collision with the rear near side of the taxi, it started to spin around rapidly.

'Gary Booth was a pedestrian, the taxi collided with him and trapped him against a set of steel railings.'

He said Mr Booth suffered a fractured tibia, fibula, femur and deep wound to his calf and had to have a skin graft to his thigh. one month after the accident he was still unable to walk unaided. He had been a healthy fit young man.

In his victim impact statement he said: 'Owing to all the injuries I sustained I had to change the type of vehicle I drive. I lost my job prior to Christmas owing to the injuries as I was unable to carry out the role. I had been a skiing instructor in Switzerland and was hoping to go back into this, it is very unlikely after this.'

Simon Gurney, in mitigation for Iqbal said: 'The defendant is fortunate that it was not more serious. He accepts full responsibility for his conduct that night for his standard of driving and accepts that it was dangerous. It is accepted that it passes the custodial threshold.

Anger: Wei says not seeing her son born has robbed him of a good start to life and says they have struggled to bond

Upset: The couple told Manchester Crown Court how their lives have suffered after Iqbal's crime

'He is 21, of good character coupled with the previously clean driving licence. He maintains he had not seen the taxi. He was driving a vehicle with too much power.

'He was driving far too quickly and in a manner that was inappropriate. The defendant doesn't seek to blame any other party for what took place that night.'

Passing sentence Recorder Neville Biddell said: 'You have caused a significant number of people very, very serious injuries, but arguably, the level of your dangerous driving is not of the most dangerous level.

'At about 10:30pm you were driving your friend home having been out for the evening.

'You clearly didn't have the experience to drive it properly, it may have been that you were showing off.

'Ahead of you was Miss Fernley she was able to see the taxi coming towards her, you missed all that and were concentrating on getting back on the inside so you could basically undertake Miss Fernley, whizzing past her.

'You were clearly driving dangerously and 50 mph was a dangerously excessive speed.

'You were cutting in and out of traffic not allowing yourself to see other traffic on the road.

'You drove into the taxi, I have seen the video and photos it is the consequences of what you did, the causing of serious injury.

'Mrs Liu she was pregnant within one month of delivery.

Happy couple: The pair show a scan of unborn baby Lucas a few months before the accident

'She sustained extremely serious injuries to her head, neck face and throat to the extent that she was unconscious.

'That had a devastating effect to her, she had to go to MRI to have an emergency Caesarean.

'Fortunately the baby was delivered. Her husband was in the taxi as well and sustained serious injuries and a friend sustained bruising.'
