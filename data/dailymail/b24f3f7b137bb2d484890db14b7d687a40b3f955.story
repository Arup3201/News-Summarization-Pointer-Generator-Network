A Tulsa police officer has been charged with first-degree murder in the off-duty shooting death of his daughter's boyfriend earlier this month.

Tulsa prosecutors formally charged Shannon Kepler Monday with the Aug. 5 killing of 19-year-old Jeremey Lake, who was dating his daughter Lisa.

Kepler, 54, was also charged with one count of shooting with intent to kill because prosecutors say he shot at his daughter during an alleged confrontation in which Lake was killed.

Kepler's wife, Gina Kepler, 48, was not charged Monday because prosecutors said there wasn't evidence to support it.

She'd been arrested along with her husband on a complaint of being an accessory after the fact of murder.

Shannon Kepler's defense attorney said he would save his comments on the charges for Tuesday, when his client is scheduled to be arraigned in district court.

Lisa Kepler, 18, has said that her parents had kicked her out of their home late July.

She met Lake while he was volunteering at the shelter where she was staying.

He offered her a place to stay at the home he shared with his aunt, Kepler said.

The young couple were walking to Lake's aunt's house on Tuesday when her father turned up in his car. She said that he asked what she was doing in the neighborhood.

When she walked away, Lake tried to introduce himself.

The police officer then shot Lake two or three times, fled in his vehicle and later turned himself in, court records show.

Lisa started to run and was shot at — but the bullet missed her, authorities said.

The police officer fled in his vehicle, but later turned himself in.

In an interview, Lisa Kepler told NBC that Lake was her 'everything'.

She told Tulsa World: ‘I really hope they rot in prison for a very long time.’

Jeremey Lake's grieving father, Carl Morse, says he is willing to forgive Shannon Kepler, the off-duty police officer who killed his son
