A man and six children have suffered horrific burns when their boat caught fire on a lake in northern Victoria.

The man, 45, and the children, aged between four and 13, were on a Gilflite ski boat at a Lake Nagambie holiday park when it caught fire just before 1pm on Tuesday.

Ambulance Victoria acting region manager Michael Whelan said all seven were in a stable condition, but the scene was chaotic.

The boat was just pulling away from the shore when it caught alight. Family, friends and bystanders quickly came to their aid and extinguished the fire

'On arrival you could hear the children screaming - they were in severe pain,' he said.

'A number of bystanders, family and friends rushed to help comfort them.

'Thankfully, bystanders had started first aid by cooling the burns before ambulance resources arrived.'

The children received burns to areas including their lower legs, arms and faces.

Two were flown to the Royal Children's Hospital, while the man, who had the most serious injuries, was flown to the Alfred Hospital.

The 45-year-old remains in a serious but stable condition with burns to much of his body. 

Three children, aged nine, 11 and 13, were taken to Goulburn Valley Base Hospital and a 14-year-old girl was taken by road ambulance to the Royal Children's Hospital.

Mr Whelan said the fire sparked after the boat was started, causing fuel to ignite - 'a fuel vapour explosion'. 

Three of the victims, including the only adult, were flown to hospital. One was transported via ambulance and the remaining three children with burns were driven to hospital where they will stay for observation

'They were all in the boat, ready to go out for a joy ride. As they were pushed away from the shore the explosion occured,' explained Sergeant Mark Crossley. 

The victims are understood to be from Melbourne and were enjoying a holiday together before the accident.

Luckily, the victims were offered assistance almost immediately. 

'Fortunately, the boat was near shore where they were starting up,' said Mr Whelan. 

'That meant they were able to escape the burning boat quite quickly and get into the water which helped stop the burning process almost immediately.

'A number of bystanders, family and friends rushed to help comfort them. It happened in a holiday park and that community and family atmosphere these parks have is fantastic.'

There was a fire extinguisher on hand to quickly control the fire.

'It was frightening to see it all unfold. I'm a little shaken up,' wrote witness Jordo Hamilton.

'Didn't see or hear explosion but the whole atmosphere at park changed. Everybody felt sickened. Very very sad news for the family and friends,' added another witness, Holly Meikle. 

Water police are investigating the vehicle to determine why the explosion occurred. 

Sgt Crossley emphasised how important it is for all members of the public to routinely maintain their vehicles and to have safety equipment, including fire extinguishers, stored on their boats - particularly before travelling with children.
