Merseyside Poice have launched an investigation after coins were thrown at Luis Suarez during Liverpool's 4-0 derby win.

Suarez produced a coin for referee Martin Atkinson's inspection but it appeared around a dozen missiles were thrown in total.

The Liverpool striker was a target for the away supporters during a typically feisty encounter between the storied rivals. Suarez displayed the coin prior to 
taking the corner that led up to Liverpool's opener, and while he leant 
down to take the flag kick, missiles from the Anfield Road end were 
cleared seen hurled in his general direction.

Liverpool boss Brendan Rodgers said: 'He never mentioned nothing, no.'

Steven Gerrard nodded home the 
resulting corner to give the hosts the lead in the 222nd installment of 
the derby, with Daniel Sturridge hitting a brace before the break to 
make it 3-0.

And Suarez 
made it 23 goals for the season immediately after the break, robbing 
Phil Jagielka of possession on the half way line and finishing with a 
typically clinical finish, as Liverpool claimed a comprehensive 4-0 win.

Merseyside Police is looking into the matter.
