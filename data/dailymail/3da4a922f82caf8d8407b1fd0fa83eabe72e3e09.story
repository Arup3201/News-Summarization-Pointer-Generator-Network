Police were called to the property on January 5, 2013 and arrested Darren Wilson of Ballarat who has recently been found guilty of the murder

The court previously heard Wilson struck O'Brien up to 20 times in the head with an axe.

Another man then allegedly hit the boy with the blunt side of the axe, the Sydney Morning Herald reports.

The Victorian Supreme Court jury returned the verdict for Wilson after only three hours deliberation.

Wilson's plea hearing will be on a date yet to be fixed but he is expected to be sentenced in the next few weeks.
