The 22-year-old niece of actress Julia Roberts was taken into custody on July 7 in Montreal after getting into a fight with her beau that left 26-year-old Peters bloody, according to TMZ.

Police were called after someone reported a fight in the couple's hotel room and found Peters with a bloody nose.

The two were said to be hitting each other and Roberts was arrested because Peters had obvious physical injuries, a source told the website.

A law enforcement source said Peters also had a bite mark, but a source close to Roberts denied the Valentine's Day actress bit him.

The couple are now reportedly back together and are working on Peters' hit show American Horror Story.

The Scream 4 star and Peters met last
 year on the set of Adult World and have been spotted in public displays
 of affection since becoming a couple.

The
 two attended a Halloween party in Beverly Hills last October and were 
holding hands as Roberts was dressed in the same iconic outfit her 
famous aunt wore in the opening scenes of 1990's Pretty Woman.

They also joined other celebrities in April at the Coachella Valley Music and Arts Festival in Indio.

In May, they kissed while waiting in line to buy tickets at the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York City.
