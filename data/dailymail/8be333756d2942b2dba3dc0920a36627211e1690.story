Former Chief Whip Andrew Mitchell, who quit the Cabinet after a media storm over his foul-mouthed row with police, has been hired to advise others on how to protect their reputation.

The senior Conservative MP will be paid £3,000-a-day as a 'senior adviser' to Montrose Associates, which specialises in helping clients deal with 'political and reputational threats'.

Mr Mitchell quit the government last year amid claims he called police 'f****** plebs' in a row about riding his bicycle through the gates of Downing Street, a phrase he denies using.

He resigned in October after a police
log, which appeared to corroborate the officers’ account, was leaked.

Scotland Yard is investigating his claim that the allegations were 
concocted. Preliminary findings are expected to be released within days.

However, the controversy has not stopped Mr Mitchell adding to his £65,000 role as an MP.

In addition to his one-day-a-month role with Montrose, revealed in his entry in the register of MPs' interests, he also earns £3,000-a-day as a member of the the advisory board of a 'growth and innovation consultancy' called The Foundation. He expects to commit six days a year to the job.

The revelation of his new job comes after it emerged Mr Mitchell is demanding an apology from Theresa May after privately accusing the Home Secretary of masterminding his exit from Government over ‘Plebgate’.

He is convinced he lost his job last autumn because of a police conspiracy – and that Mrs May was instrumental  in turning the Cabinet against him when his fate hung in  the balance.

And he also believes she let her view that his position had become untenable become known to the media.

Mr Mitchell wants Mrs May to personally apologise for ‘prejudging’ him. He believes she told colleagues he should not remain in his job because his continued presence was damaging the Government. He claims to have proof she briefed journalists to that effect.

When Mrs May was asked at the time whether she had been in the ‘vanguard’ of efforts to force him to step down, she said: ‘I’m not going to talk about private conversations.’

A friend of Mr Mitchell said last night: ‘There are many at Westminster who feel it would be nice if those who got it so wrong were to acknowledge that.’ A spokeswoman for Mrs May declined to comment.

Mr Mitchell, who is supported by powerful figures including former party leader Michael Howard and ex-Shadow Home Secretary David Davis, is confident a prosecution review of evidence gathered by Operation Alice, the Scotland Yard investigation into claims of police fabrication, will back his version of events.

A Channel 4 investigation cast doubt 
on the initial police account when it revealed that CCTV footage showed 
there was not a large group of tourists outside the gate during the row,
as was originally claimed. And an email supposedly from a witness 
backing up the police account of events has also been called into 
question.

Earlier this month The Mail on Sunday disclosed that Mr Mitchell had written to Deborah Glass, deputy chairman  of the Independent Police Complaints Commission, to accuse police of a sustained ‘dishonest and illicit’ campaign to destroy him, including the leaking of information to the press that suggested the inquiry would dismiss his claims.
