This weekend sees the first blockbuster sporting weekend of 2015 with football, rugby, boxing, and cricket all on the agenda. Fancy doing a 24 hour marathon of watching all the sport? Well, Sportsmail has put together a guide of how to do just that. Good luck.

Saturday 28 February 

10.30pm Carl Frampton vs Chris Avalos

The 24 hours of sport starts with the super-bantamweight fight between Carl ‘The Jackal’ Frampton and American challenger Chris Avalos. The fight is live on ITV which is a boost for the sport as there is potential for a wider audience.

10pm - 6am England vs Sri Lanka

Once the ‘Fighting Pride of Belfast’ has kept his unbeaten record intact (hopefully), switch over to Sky Sports' World Cup channel and watch Eoin Morgan’s England face Sri Lanka in Wellington. Unless Frampton gets the job done early, then you are likely to miss a few overs, and if England are batting then maybe a few wickets.

But after two defeats in a row for England, they got back on track against Scotland. Now they will look for a second win to push them closer to a place in the quarter finals. If the worst happens and England collapse then you may have a chance for a full fry up, but just a bowl of cereal if this goes the distance.

Sunday 1 March

6am to 7.30am – Either 90 minutes of shut-eye or just have a hearty breakfast to set you up for a return to the sofa

7.30am - 9am Match of the Day repeat

With live sport dominating proceedings on Saturday night, it was inevitable that there would have to be a sacrifice, but worry not, as Match of the Day is back on BBC1 on Sunday morning. So if you have managed to avoid finding out the scores from Burnley vs Swansea and Stoke vs Hull then now is the chance to catch up and watch the highlights with Gary and the boys.

Or, if you fancy something different, Sportsmail's Neil Ashton hosts Sunday Supplement on Sky Sports 1 from 8am. 

Match of the Day will be repeated on BBC 1 during Sunday morning if you miss it on Saturday night

9am - 12noon filler Pakistan vs Zimbabwe/Valencia vs Real Sociedad/make a sandwich

If you are really determined to see through a full 24 hours of sport, then you will have to choose between World Cup cricket or La Liga action for your next helping.

David Moyes takes his Real Sociedad side to Valencia, in what will be a tough test for the former Manchester United manager against a  side pushing for the Champions League.

Pakistan go into their game with Zimbabwe bottom of Pool B and without a win from their two games. Zimbabwe have not fared much better, with their only win coming against UAE. There is plenty of time to make a midday snack to keep you going.

12noon - 2pm Liverpool vs Man City

The real action gets going at midday when two of the Premier League’s heavyweights meet at Anfield. Both Manchester City and Liverpool suffered disappointing defeats in Europe in the week and will want to respond with a good performance in the Premier League. With Chelsea not in league action this weekend, City know a win will see them cut the lead at the top of the table to two points. While Liverpool will want to narrow the gap between them and the top four.

Worried someone might interrupt your weekend of sport by trying to watch the EastEnders omnibus? Worry no more with this brilliant case which is being given away on Twitter by Capital One.

2pm - 4pm Arsenal vs Everton/Norwich vs Ipswich

There will hardly be any time to put the kettle on between the two Premier League games, because as soon the game finishes at Anfield then Arsenal will be kicking off against Everton in London. The Toffees may be England’s last representatives in the Europa League, but they are struggling domestically. In fact they have not won at Arsenal since January 1996. To give you some idea how long ago that was, it was the same week that George Michael’s Jesus to a Child knocked Michael Jackson’s Earth Song off the top of the charts.

Make sure your batteries in your remote control are fully charged because they will be working overtime. If you fancy a break from the Premier League then flick over to Sky Sports 3 and watch a very tasty East Anglia derby between Norwich and Ipswich. Both teams a going well and pushing for a promotion with the Tractor Boys just one point above the Canaries. With the top of the Championship so tight, a result in this game could go a long way to deciding which side is better placed for promotion.

3pm - 5pm Ireland vs England

There will be more channel hopping required here as this will be the busiest part of the day, because over in Dublin the two unbeaten sides in the Six Nations go head to head when Ireland face England. With the Grand Slam up for grabs both sides will be determined to win, and for England it will be a chance to get revenge for missing out on the title last year as Ireland triumphed.

George Ford will prove a key player for England if they are to beat Ireland in their Six Nations clash on Sunday

4pm - 6pm Capital One Cup final

Next to Wembley and there is more channel hopping required. Stick with the rugby on BBC1 if England are winning or switch to Sky Sports 1 for Capital One Cup final if they are losing. London rivals Chelsea and Tottenham go head to head for the first piece of domestic silverware of the season. Jose Mourinho is yet to win a trophy in his second spell at Chelsea and is desperate to put a cup in the trophy cabinet.

Spurs have already beaten Chelsea this season and will hope for a repeat of the 2008 final when the north London side came out on top thanks to a Jonathan Woodgate winner.

Jonathan Woodgate's goal gave Tottenham a 2-1 win vs Chelsea after extra-time in the 2008 League Cup final

6pm - 8pm Sevilla vs Atletico Madrid/dinner

Had your fill of English football? Luckily Sevilla v Atletico Madrid is served up next on Sky Sports 5. You would be forgiven for taking a break to make some food at this point, but this should be a decent game between third and fifth.

After the Capital One Cup final the attention switches over to Spain where Atletico Madrid travel to Sevilla

8pm - 10pm Real Madrid vs Villarreal / PSG /Monaco

Finish off the marathon with Real Madrid vs Villarreal on Sky Sports 5. If you are in danger of nodding off then Cristiano Ronaldo and Gareth Bale are sure to keep you awake a little longer. But once that is done, go to bed, you deserve it and more than likely have work in the morning! 

Your Sunday evening viewing is concluded with the option of watching Real Madrid host Villarreal at 8pm
