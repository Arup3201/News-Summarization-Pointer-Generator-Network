A senior Labour councillor was suspended last night after backing sick calls for the IRA to repeat its bombing of the Conservative Party conference.

Florence Anderson, chairman of Sunderland Council’s crime and disorder committee, was suspended after making the ‘disgraceful’ comment on the social network site Facebook.

The 1984 bombing of Brighton’s Grand Hotel killed five and left several more injured, including the wife of the Tory Cabinet minister Norman Tebbit. Margaret Thatcher narrowly escaped with her life after the blast wrecked the bathroom of her hotel room.

Mrs Anderson, a former deputy leader of the council, courted controversy in 2010 when she called for Baroness Thatcher to ‘burn in hell’. At the time she said the comments were made in a private capacity and Labour agreed to stand by her.

But the party moved swiftly to remove the Labour whip last night after details of her latest comments became public.

A Labour spokesman said: ‘These comments are disgraceful. Florence Anderson has been suspended from the Labour Party with immediate effect in light of this information.’ The move followed comments made by Mrs Anderson on the site of the controversial Facebook group ‘Margaret Thatcher doesn’t have to be dead before we give her a funeral’.

An unknown contributor posted the message: 'We are appealing to the IRA to find it in their hearts to bomb the next Tory conference.' Mrs Anderson clicked on a button showing she 'liked' the comment

An unknown contributor posted the message: ‘We are appealing to the IRA to find it in their hearts to bomb the next Tory conference.’

Mrs Anderson clicked on a button showing she ‘liked’ the comment - a way of indicating support for the sentiment.

Dominic McDonough, a Tory candidate in Sunderland at the last council elections, described her actions as ‘sickening’ and said the council’s ruling Labour group should explain why she had not been booted out earlier.

Mrs Anderson, a grandmother who ran a 
wives’ support group during the miners’ strike, could not be contacted 
for comment last night.

But in the past she has been unrepentant about her extreme anti-Tory views.

Asked
 about her 2010 comments she said: ‘I’m a miner’s widow. I remember 
1984/5 as if it was yesterday. I hate Thatcher for what she did to my 
community.’
