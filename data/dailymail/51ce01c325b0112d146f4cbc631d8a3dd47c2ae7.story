The father of a victim of the Germanwings disaster has made an emotional appeal for airlines to 'look after their pilots properly' to make sure another tragedy 'never happens'.

Philip Bramley, whose 28-year-old son Paul was one of three Britons on board the ill-fated Airbus A320, said the 150 who lost their lives should 'not be forgotten'.

Speaking at a memorial near the crash site in the French Alps, Mr Bramley fought back his tears as he talked about his son.

Paul Bramley, from Hull, was studying hospitality and hotel management in Lucerne, Switzerland, where he was about to start an internship after travelling with Ms Tiirik.

He had been to Barcelona after completing his first term of college for a few days’ holiday with friends. Mr Bramley was flying back to the UK via Dusseldorf to see his family.

Father-of two Martyn Matthews, from Wolverhampton, seven-month-old Julian Pracz-Bandres, from Manchester, and his mother Marina Bandres Lopez Belio, 37, were also among the dead. 

Philip Bramley today told Sky News that co-pilot Andreas Lubitz was 'ill' and his motivation for deliberately downing the plane was 'irrelevant'.

He said: 'What is relevant, is that it should never happen again; my son and everyone on that plane should not be forgotten, ever. I don't want it to be forgotten, ever.'

'I believe the airlines should be more transparent and our finest pilots looked after properly. We put our lives and our children's lives in their hands. 

'I want to see this cloud over this town lifted and the natural beauty be restored and not to be remembered by the action of a single person.'

A special Mass was held today in Dignes to honour the victims and support their families.

Bishop Jean-Philippe Nault led the Mass, attended by about 200 people from the surrounding region, deeply shaken by the crash. It was the deadliest crash on French soil in decades.

Questions continue to be asked about Lubitz's mental and physical health days after he locked the captain out of the Airbus' cockpit and bringing down the aircraft.

It was claimed today that the pilot may have sought treatment for problems with his vision in the weeks leading up to the crash.

Lubitz is said to have sought help over his vision as recently as March 10, amid fears his eye problems may have jeopardised his ability to continue working as a pilot.

It came as police revealed that evidence found at his home suggested he was suffering from a 'serious psychosomatic illness'. 

Officers reportedly found a variety of drugs used to treat mental illness at his flat in Dusseldorf, appearing to substantiate claims he was severely depressed. 

Authorities have already revealed he hid a sick note declaring him unfit to work on the day of the disaster.

German newspaper Bild has reported that he previously told an ex-girlfriend: 'One day I will do something that will change the whole system, and then all will know my name and remember it.'
