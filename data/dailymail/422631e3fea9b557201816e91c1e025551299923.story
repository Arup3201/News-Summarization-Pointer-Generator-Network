It may look like a strange mix between skates, cycle and scooter, but this machine, according to one Germany company, is the future of exercise.

The bizarre vehicle, dubbed the AeYO, claims to combine the efficient and dynamic motion of inline skating with the convenience and safety of a bicycle.

It features the handle bar, brakes levers and basket of a bicycle but has a pair of skates attached to the steering column.

Compatible with any regular shoe size, the rider straps their feet in and then uses a skating motion to propel the vehicle forwards.

While on a traditional scooter, riders are likely to plant their one leg for the majority of the time, but the Aeyo's design keeps both legs moving.

The legs allow the skates to move freely, but also prevent them from tilting, keeping the feet stable. 

Munich-based Aemotics has priced the machine at £370 and claims it is suitable for all ages to improve cardio fitness. 

The Aeyo uses two strap-on skates connected to the front wheel. Instead of single-foot skating used on a scooter, the Aeyo rider gets both legs involved in a similar way to inline skating

Instead of single-foot skating used on a scooter, the Aeyo rider gets both legs involved in a similar way to inline skating.

The legs allow the skates to move freely, but also prevent them from tilting, keeping the feet stable.

The design works the core, back and arms, getting more than 10 muscle groups involved.

The group added that it works the core, back and arms, getting more than 10 muscle groups involved.

Spokesman Andreas Epstein explained: ‘The combination of the upright position with the flexibility of the construction ensures a great workout for the whole body, be it legs, buttocks, arms and especially the core.

‘AeYO skating translates into one continuous, upright motion. While you keep the overview, your body cells are supplied with oxygen.

‘The upright position helps to avoid muscle cramps and releases tension, freeing your mind."

The Aeyo comes with optional accessories including a lighting system, basket and case.

It folds up via the same joints that allow for it to skate and magnets hold it together in a portable package.  

If you don’t mind some raised eyebrows, it could be the perfect vehicle for your commute into work.
