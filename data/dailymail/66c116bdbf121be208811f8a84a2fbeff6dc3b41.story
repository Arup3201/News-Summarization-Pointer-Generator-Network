In an emotional goodbye to 100,000 supporters, the Pope revealed that he is stepping aside because God told him to.

In a voice raw with emotion, Benedict XVI told tens of thousands of pilgrims in St Peter's Square that he was resigning because God had called on him to devote himself to prayer. He said God had told him 'to climb the mountain'.

Pilgrims filled the piazza to witness a historical moment and thank the Pope for his eight year Pontificate at the Angelus Prayer, his penultimate public appearance as the Pontiff.

Message: Pope Benedict XVI delivers his final Angelus prayer, telling a crowd of 100,000 that he will lead a life of prayer because God told him to. He is stepping down because he no longer has the strength the role requires

Despite recently looking tired and frail, today he spoke in a clear, strong voice, repeatedly thanking the faithful for their closeness and affection as they interrupted him, again and again, with applause and cheers. Police estimated some 100,000 people turned out.

Benedict insisted he was 'not abandoning the church.' Instead, speaking in Italian, he said he'll serve the church with the same dedication he has until now, but will do so 'in a way more suitable to my age and my strength'.

He also said he would continue to serve through meditation and prayer after his historic abdication.

He completed the last Angelus of his 
tenure by saying he will always be close to the Church and its people.

A
child in the crowd held up a sign on a yellow placard, written in 
Italian, 'You are not alone, I'm with you'. Other admirers held
signs simply saying 'Thank you'.

Today was the Pope's second-to-last public appearance. He will appear once more on Wednesay before he steps down

Heavy rain had been forecast for Rome, and some drizzle dampened the square earlier in the morning, but when Benedict appeared, to the peal of church bells as the clock struck noon, blue sky crept through the clouds.

'We thank God for the sun he has given us,' the Pope said.

The 85-year-old will spend his last years in seclusion in a cloistered monastery within the confines of Vatican City.

The Pope officially steps down on Thursday. He resigned two weeks ago, saying he no longer has the mental or physical strength to lead the world's 1.2billion Catholics. It is the first time a Pope has stepped down in 600 years.

Vatican-watchers have speculated that his declining health is a key factor.

It has subsequently emerged that the Pope had had a secret heart operation to replace a pace-maker three months ago.

The Pontiff also suffered a head wound during an official visit to Mexico last year, which was said to have shaken him.

Senior church figure Vincenzo Paglia, the Bishop of Terni, has claimed the Pope's memory had deteriorated and that he suffered from occasional spells of lack of consciousness.

The Pope has recently appeared frail, but spoke clearly and strongly today

Other theories have placed Benedict at the centre of a plot by a rebel faction of cardinals unhappy with his handling of the sexual abuse crisis.

The Vatican earlier this week rubbished Italian media reports alleging the pope's resignation was linked to a secret dossier claiming there is a 'gay network' inside the clergy.

Italian newspapers have been rife with unsourced reports claiming the secret dossier from three cardinals reveals an underground network
of senior clergy who have organised gay homosexual parties and faced 
blackmail.

La Repubblica newspaper claimed the explosive allegations were made in a report into the 
so-called 'Vatileaks' scandal which was presented to the Pontiff on or 
around December 17.

But the
Vatican accused Italian media of spreading 'false and damaging' 
reports in an attempt to influence cardinals who will meet 
in a secret conclave next month to elect a new pope.

A date has not been set to hold a vote to elect Benedict XVI's replacement

The Pope has just one more public appearance, at his weekly audience on Wednesday.

No date has yet been set for the start of the conclave of cardinals, who will vote in secret to elect Benedict's successor.

One Italian in the crowd seemed to be doing a little campaigning, hoisting a sign which mentioned the name of two Italian cardinals considered by observers to be potential contenders in the selection of the next pontiff.

The cardinals in the conclave will have to decide whether it's time to look outside of Europe for a pope.

Meanwhile Britain's most senior Catholic 
clergyman, Cardinal Keith O'Brien, has been reported to the Vatican for 
alleged inappropriate behaviour, it emerged last night.

Three
priests and one former priest have sent statements to the papal nuncio,
Antonio Mennini, alleging impropriety dating back to 1980.

As head of the Roman Catholic Church in Scotland,
next week O'Brien will be part of the conclave choosing the next Pope, 
but now he faces demands for his immediate resignation.

As reported by The Observer, one
of the priests alleges that he has needed counselling after an inappropriate relationship with O'Brien.

A second complainant 
said that he was 18-years-old when O'Brien made an inappropriate approach after 
night prayers.

A third said he was invited to 'get to know' O'Brien at the archbishop's 
residence only to face 'unwanted behaviour' from O'Brien after late-night drinking.

The four are all from the diocese of St Andrews and Edinburgh.

A spokesman for the cardinal said that he contests the allegations.
