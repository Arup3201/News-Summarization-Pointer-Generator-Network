Ever want to release your inner princess but feel restricted by the latest trends on the high street? Well now you can let your sparkly self go with this new range of fairytale fashioned clothing.

The collection has been created by Australian fashion brand Black Milk Clothing and is inspired by some of Disney’s most iconic films including Snow White, Alice in Wonderland, Cinderella, Beauty and the Beast, The Little Mermaid and Sleeping Beauty.

In the eye-catching advertising campaign the models sport Disney-inspired hair, including Snow White's black bob, Ariel's bright red locks  and Sleeping Beauty's tumbling blonde curls.

For girls wanting to channel Ariel the Little Mermaid the collection includes dresses, tops and leggings in glitzy green lycra with a scaly design.

If you're more of a Snow White kind of girl there's a bright blue body inspired by the heroine, which comes with matching yellow mini or maxi skirts.

And for fans of the more traditional girlie look, there are dresses emblazoned with sparkly princesses in puffy sleeves and perfectly coiffed hair.

But don't expect fairytale modesty from the designs themselves. Slash-front swimsuits, barely-there minis and skin-tight lycra add a dash of daring to the princess theme.

So
 what's the cost of looking like a princess? Dresses and printed 
leggings sell for around $85 AUD (£50), jackets for $110 AUD (£65) and 
tops for $45 AUD (£25).

The collection, aptly named 'Princesses and Villains', also contains pieces featuring the dark side of Disney. One jacket has the Evil Queen from Snow White on the back with the slogan, 'Don't be scared' beneath.

Black Milk was started at founder James Lillis' kitchen table in 2009 and now has over 150 employees. But this is their first range that has been officially licensed by Disney, according to the brand.

The Brisbane-based label, which ships globally for free, has become known for its quirky style and has captured the attention of fashion fans across the globe, now attracting one million followers on Instagram.
