A servant soldier of an army officer killed on the front line in the First World War wrote a letter telling of his guilt at not being there for him.

The poignant letter, written to Lieutenant Musgrove Wroughton's family by Private Haselin has emerged after 98 years.

Lt Wroughton, the son of an English aristocrat and the
world’s first Boy Scout, ordered his batman to stay behind the front 
lines while he went into battle.

Lt Wroughton's bravery and the devotion displayed by his servant has been compared to that of Matthew Crawley in Downton Abbey, pictured, who goes to the Western Front with his footman who ends up getting killed

He was fatally-shot through the chest by
a German sniper during the First Battle of Ypres and became one of the 
first officers of the First World War to die.

The untold story of Lt Wroughton’s 
bravery and the devotion displayed by his servant has been compared to that of 
Matthew Crawley in Downton Abbey, who goes to the Western Front with his
footman who ends up getting killed.

Private Haselin had been in service at Lt Wroughton’s parent’s country estate.

His letter, which he wrote to them after he had been shot, has come to light after an incredible archive of letters of condolence to William and Edith Wroughton was found in a house clearance in the west country.

He wrote: 'I am sorry to tell you that Mr Wroughton is wounded and I hear rather bad.

'I have his horses with me. He told me yesterday to look after the horses and not go in the trechens (sic) so was not in the thick of it but I wish I had been with him all the same. Poor Mr Wroughton.'

After his master’s death, Pvt Haselin wrote again: 'I always ride his charger and look after it so you see I still serve him in a way, never a day passes but what his name is not mentioned as being so good to us all.'

One of the other archived letters was
from Robert Baden-Powell who seven years earlier, when he founded the 
Scout movement, selected their 15-year-old son for the first camp on 
Brownsea Island in Poole Harbour, Dorset.

The pair later travelled to America to give talks on the Scouts before the outbreak of the First World War.

Baden-Powell
wrote: 'I have felt as nearly as possible like a second father to him 
and to read the little testimonies to Bob’s character...is the greatest 
possible comfort.

'I am so glad he had made his mark already before he died. That must be some comfort to you and to his mother.'

Another letter was from Lt Wroughton’s sergeant major who enclosed a photograph of his grave at Ypres with it.

Sgt
Maj Lockyer wrote: 'He was such a brave young officer. Sgt Stone & I
carried him to a place of cover, his last words to me were ‘never mind 
me Sgt Major, look after yourself.'

The archive, that also includes Lt Wroughton’s identity tags, is now being sold at auction with a pre-sale estimate of £1,000.

Richard
Westwood-Brookes, of auctioneers Mullocks of Shropshire, said: 'What 
comes out of these letters is how this young man was a hero.

'He thought more of his servant and his horse than he did for his own safety.

'The
spirit of comradeship and self-sacrifice is the philosophy of the Scout
movement and clearly Baden-Powell instilled that belief in Bob 
Wroughton.

'His story is 
similar to that of Matthew Crawley in Downton Abbey, who went to the 
Western Front with his footman who ends up getting killed.

Lt Wroughton aged 8-years-old. He became one of the first officers of the First World War to die

'Bob Wroughton was from a landed, monied family and destined for great things.

'Whenever you see archives of this nature you cannot fail to be moved by what you read.

'Bob
Wroughton was a fine example of the many millions of young men, on both
sides, who were needlessly slaughtered by the madness of the First 
World War.'

Lt 
Wroughton’s family’s seat was at Creaton Lodge, Northamptonshire, but 
his parents also had a home in Hannover Square, central London.

His father William was the director of a limited liability company and the master of the Pytchley Hunt.

Lt
Wroughton was educated at Harrow before receiving a commission in the 
Northampton Yeomanry and joining the 12th (Prince of Wales’s Royal) 
Lancers.

He died on October 30, 1914, aged 24. The auction takes place on November 22.
