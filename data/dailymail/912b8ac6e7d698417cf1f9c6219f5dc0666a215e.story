The scoreline was deceiving at Old Trafford on Wednesday evening.

Yes, Manchester United scored three times against Burnley but the performance did not do anything to silence the doubters of Louis van Gaal's side.

Here, Sportsmail's Mike Keegan looks at what we learned from United's 3-1 victory over Burnley.

Wayne Rooney, defensive midfielder?

United fans had called on their talisman to be shifted upfront from his place on the right of the diamond, bemoaning a waste of his attacking talents. 

Like having Rolls Royce and leaving it in the garage, said some. 

Little did they realise that when he was moved it would be backwards take over the holding role from the injured Blind. 

A bizarre sight, Rooney cleaning up in front of the back four but credit to the England man, he took on the responsibility like a captain and led his team to victory.

Ander Herrera has not been kidnapped

Has played just 56 minutes this year with conspiracy theorists in meltdown. Had he run over Van Gaal's cat? 

Did he follow Anderson to KFC? At £29m the Dutchman's first signing has hardly been given a chance to impress. 

Tonight, however, he got it. When he came off the bench to replace the injured Blind Old Trafford erupted in ironic cheers. 

Will have enjoyed a rare run out but did not do much to leave United fans wondering what they have been missing. No doubt desperately short of match fitness.

Are the natives getting restless?

They have been resolute in their backing for Louis van Gaal but are United fans reaching the end of their tether? 

Consensus in the press box was that the prolific Chris Smalling's second goal on the stroke of half-time saved Van Gaal's men from being booed off at the break. 

Credit to them, though, while shouts of frustration were audible this is still an onside crowd who back their man. 

Chants of Louis van Gaal's red and white army started in the K Stand and seemed to lift United a level. 

Like last year under Moyes, they deserve credit. Watching United is not as fun as it used to be.

The United supporters were frustrated at their team's performance, especially in the first half

Is the problem of Di Maria being solved?

This was more like it. Playing on the left of the diamond and terrorised Burnley on the break and relished getting out wide. 

He had come under-fire for lacking desire but covered every blade and even landed himself in the book for a late challenge which will have delighted the United faithful. 

Laid Smalling's second on a plate from a short corner that worked. A short corner that worked! Won the penalty and finally began to look at home in a red shirt. 

Yes, tougher challenges lie ahead but this was impressive from the £59.7m man.

Danny Ings is the real deal

It's not hard to stand out in Burnley's tin foil away kit but Danny Ings shone the brightest with a zesty performance that caused United's defence no end of problems. 

Almost unplayable in the first-half with no disrespect to Sean Dyche's Lancashire battlers you get the impression that in a stronger side he might have a similar impact to Harry Kane at Spurs. 

He really does look that good.
