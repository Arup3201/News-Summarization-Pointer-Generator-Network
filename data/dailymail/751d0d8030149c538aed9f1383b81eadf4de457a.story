A security guard stopped British cycling legend Sir Chris Hoy from entering the velodrome named in his honour because he did not have the right pass.

The six-time Gold medallist, who is Team GB's most successful Olympian, was due to commentate on today's action at the Sir Chris Hoy Velodrome in Glasgow on the opening day of the Commonwealth Games.

BBC Radio 5live reported how Sir Chris was asked for identification to enter his own velodrome - after the female guard did not recognise him.

After explaining who he was, Sir Chris was allowed in by the official for the start of the action.

Realising her error, the embarrassed guard told a 5live reporter: 'Please, please can you apologise to him.'

The woman, who claimed Sir Chris had been on the telephone at the time, added: 'I didn't realise who he was. My mum is going to kill me!'

He then tweeted: 'All set and ready to go here at the velodrome, nice vantage point here up in the commentary box!'

The Olympian was clearly unfazed by the incident, tweeting: 'She was just doing her job!!'

A Commonwealth Games spokesperson was unavailable for comment.

Earlier this week gold medal-winning 
cyclist Sir Bradley Wiggins complained that Sir Chris Hoy had been 'done
 over' by the corporate branding on the velodrome.

Wiggins said: 'I'd be a bit p***** off
 if I were him, because they've stuck a great big Emirates sign over his
 name and it doesn't stand out that it's the Sir Chris Hoy Velodrome 
other than a little thing as you walk in.

'It's more like a shopping sign with an Emirates thing on it,' he said. The airline is the official sponsorship partner of Glasgow 2014.

Wiggins added that Sir Chris deserved to have a 'whopping great statue outside'.

Edinburgh-born Hoy, who is reporting for the BBC during the Games, insisted he was delighted with the facility.

The Sir Chris Hoy Velodrome played host to the UCI Track Cycling World Cup in November 2012, the Scottish National Track Championships and the UCI Under-13 Track Championships in 2013.

A bid is being made to host the 2016 World Track Championships.
