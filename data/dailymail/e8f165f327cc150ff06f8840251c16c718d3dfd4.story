A 102-year-old pensioner has revealed she has had the same Christmas tree for more than 80 years.

Eliza Woolhouse, who celebrated her 102nd birthday this month, has had the artificial tree so long she can no longer remember how much she paid for it.

But the great-grandmother from Royston, near Barnsley, South Yorks, has decorated her beloved two-foot tree for more than eight decades, buying it the same year her first son Jimmy was born in 1932.

Old ones are the best: Mrs Woolhouse said 'they don't make them like this any more'

Widow Mrs Woolhouse, who worked as a seamstress, said: 'They don't make them like this any more. I'm too old and I've had it too long to want another. I've always valued it.

'The children have all got big, beautiful trees so if I want to see one I can just go look at theirs.'

The tree, constructed around a single piece of cane with artificial branches covered in green tinsel, has taken pride of place in the same corner of Eliza's living room throughout the years.

She decorates it every Christmas with the same glass baubles that she's looked after for decades.

She said: 'I've not bought any new decorations for years.'
