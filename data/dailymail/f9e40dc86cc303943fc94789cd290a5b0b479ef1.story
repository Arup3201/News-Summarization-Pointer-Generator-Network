A man turned up at a police station to confess the murder of his pregnant girlfriend - carrying the victim's head in a carrier bag, it was reported today.

Brazilian Jose Ramos dos Santos, 23, said he strangled then decapitated 16-year-old Shirley Souza after she admitted she had cheated on him.

But two days after the crime he claimed he felt 'regret' for what he had done and decided to own up to the gruesome killing.

Santos reportedly carried the plastic bag containing the girl's head with him as he took two buses on a two-hour journey to the police station in the centre of Sao Paulo, southeast Brazil.

Police officers were reportedly 'aghast' after being handed the severed head after Santos made his murder confession on Saturday night.

Santos told police his girlfriend of one year had visited him on Thursday night at the house he shares with his brother.

After having sex for more than two hours, he said the couple began arguing over whether each had ever been unfaithful, and Ms Souza confessed to cheating on him with a mutual friend.

Santos claimed he strangled Ms Souza in a fit of rage, then went to have a shower, and after he returned realised that she had died.

Santos said he sawed off Miss Souza's with a bread knife before hiding her body in a storage cupboard, but dumped her body after a day when his brother began complaining of a bad odour in the house

Santos turned up at a local police station and admitted the crime two days later, and as officers started taking his statement he produced a carrier bag, containing her severed head

He said he sawed off her head with a bread knife before hiding her body in a storage cupboard, but after a day when his brother began complaining of a bad odour in the house he dumped the rest of her body in an alleyway near his home.

The body was found by local residents the next day and police were called, and Santos decided to confess to the crime, arriving at the police station at 7pm that evening.

A police spokesman said Santos claimed he 'started to feel a growing sense of regret over the course of the day, so decided to hand himself over the police.

'Officers started taking his statement, which is when he produced a carrier bag, containing the evidence. They were aghast, they hadn't expected that.'
