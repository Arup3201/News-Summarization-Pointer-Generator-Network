Luisana Lopilato took on the new role of motherhood this year so it's no surprise she's decided to take a step back from modelling to focus on her son, Noah.

But lingerie brand Ultimo are making the most of the Argentine beauty before she bows out by getting her to showcase their Christmas range.

Michael Bublé's wife wears the 'Oh La La' and 'Va Va Voom' bra and set in their festive campaign pictures.

Bowing out: New mother Luisana Lopilato poses for Ultimo lingerie in her last shoot for the brand

Posing on her New York rooftop and inside her apartment, the 26-year-old new mother looks effortlessly beautiful in the lacy lingerie.

The styles are available in sizes 32-38 A-G and priced from 
£10 for briefs and £20 for bras.

Luisana has been the face and body of Ultimo 
for two years but will be replaced by a new celebrity in 2014, who will be announced soon.

Speaking of Luisana's departure, Ultimo founder Michelle Mone, said: 'Luisana has been 
incredible for Ultimo thanks to her international profile. She's been 
the perfect role model and a true asset to the brand, as well as a good 
friend.

Christmas cracker: After showcasing the festive range, the model is now planning to focus on her four-month-old Noah

'Luisana is taking time out with her new baby boy, Noah - we wish
 her all the very best and I'm sure that she will be back working with 
us again in future.'

Luisana and singer Michael, 37, had son Noah in August and the proud parents shared a picture of them with their newborn from the delivery room.

But even before Ultimo have released these sizzling shots of Luisana, Michelle reported that sales have risen as men look to add underwear to their wive's and girlfriend's stockings.

She said: 'In the space of a week, Ultimo website 
sales have shot up by 80 per cent. People are clearly in the shopping spirit and
 starting to spend, spend, spend as Christmas approaches, clambering to 
find that perfect gift.  

'From
 our fashion collection, red and black lingerie are proving most 
popular, as well as the sexier Ultimo styles, which are being snapped up
 by men buying for their wives or girlfriends.'
