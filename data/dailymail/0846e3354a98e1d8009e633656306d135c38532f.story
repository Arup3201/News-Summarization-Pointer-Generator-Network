France has unveiled its new Prime Minister, tasked with the difficult job of slashing unemployment and saving the country's flagging economy.

New prime minister Manuel Valls took up his post today and quickly set about forming a reshuffled government - which could be proposed as early as Wednesday.

It comes after Franceâ€™s socialist prime minister resigned along with his entire government yesterday following a meltdown in local elections.

Jean-Marc Ayrault admitted that a huge swing to the Right, including to the extremist National Front, was down to him and his Left-wing government.

Two ministers from Hollande's Greens coalition partners who worked in Ayrault's cabinet have already said they would not be 
available to work with 51-year-old centrist Valls.

His first task will to be to form a government team of at least 25 members more 
effective to replace the outgoing group of 38, whose infighting had attracted criticisms of amateurishness.

The tough-talking interior minister has consistently been Hollande's most popular minister in surveys.

Speaking as he took up his post, during a brief handover ceremony with Ayrault at the 
18th-century Matignon mansion in central Paris, he said: 'This is a difficult but inspiring task.

'I will continue the work you have done to put right our country, economy, industry and public finances.

Valls' centrist views make him controversial with the left wing of the Socialist Party, despite his popularity - including with conservative voters.

There has been speculation over whether Pierre Moscovici will remain in the powerful finance minister's job, whereas some have talked of a return to government for Hollande's former partner, Segolene Royal.
