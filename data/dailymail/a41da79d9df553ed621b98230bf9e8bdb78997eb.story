Don't cancel those bank holiday barbecue plans just yet - heavy downpours may have blighted the start of the weekend for many, but tomorrow the whole country will once again be bathed in sunshine.

Highs of up to 27C will help dry out the UK tomorrow, after a wet start to the weekend which saw flash flooding hit the east, particularly in the south.

Suffolk, Kent, Essex and London have seen up to 0.4ins more rain fall overnight but further up the east coast the rain has begun to ease.Scroll down for video

So far the west has seen a stark difference in the weather this weekend, enjoying dry and sunny spells but by this afternoon the whole country will be clear of rain.

Alexi Boothman, forecaster for the MeteoGroup, the weather division for the Press Association, said: 'Quite a lot of rain has fallen overnight particularly in the south-eastern corner.

'It is already clearing along the east coast in most areas and by this afternoon the rain should have stopped apart from the odd shower.

'Tomorrow it will be a warm Bank Holiday Monday, the warmest day of the week.

'It will generally be 25C across England, up to 27C in some areas including London.

'Wales should reach 24C and it will be cooler further north, around 22C in Scotland.'

Monday will be the sunniest and warmest day of the week, according to forecasters

The drier weather will be a relief for music lovers at Leeds Festival in Bramham Park but it's likely to remain muddy following yesterday's torrential rain.

Festival staff managed to keep the arena passable by covering the ground in woodchips.

Wellies and ponchos are still the order of the day at the Reading Festival following overnight showers.

Conditions mean it will be a dreary kick-off to the UK's largest carnival today, with the loud, colourful procession met with rain, improving slightly in the afternoon but seeing the best of the warm weather tomorrow.

But the weather is unlikely to put 
people off attending the Notting Hill Carnival, one of the liveliest 
events on the London calendar.

The
foul weather has also hit the final Ashes test at The Oval. The heavy 
rain scuppered play yesterday and further wet weather during the night delayed play until 11.30am.

Heavy rain has caused a number of roads to be flooded in Essex. Police said there were floods in a number of places and the worst hit areas were Southend, Canvey, Maldon, Burnham, Battlesbridge and Benfleet.

A body believed to be that on a 15 year old boy has been recovered from a river in Bedfordshire. The teenager went missing while swimming in the river Ivel in Biggleswade Friday evening.

The quirky event takes place every August Bank Holiday at the dense Waen Rhydd peat bog, near Llanwrtyd Wells in Wales

The 28th World Bog Snorkelling Championships saw 130 competitors from around the world, some in fancy dress, descend on Waen Rhydd Bog on the outskirts of Llanwrtyd Wells, Powys, mid Wales, for the August bank holiday ritual

Run by a team of volunteers, the annual competition is part of a roster of eccentric events held throughout the year at Llanwrtyd Wells, the UK's smallest town, in Powys, mid Wales

Meanwhile, dozens of swimmers braved murky waters as an 18-year-old woman smashed the world record time for bog snorkelling.

The 28th World Bog Snorkelling Championships saw 130 competitors from around the world, some in fancy dress, descend on Waen Rhydd Bog on the outskirts of Llanwrtyd Wells, Powys, mid Wales, for the August bank holiday ritual.

Winner Dineka Maguire, from Northern Ireland, beat the previous best time by just over a second when she swam two lengths of the 55-metre (180ft) trench in one minute and 23.13 seconds.

Bob Greenough, one of the competition's organisers, said: 'Dineka has been competing for six years but this is her first year as a senior. I couldn't believe her time.

'We have the serious athletes, who want to prove to their friends they can do it, and people in fancy dress. Part of the fun is making a fool of yourself. One competitor was from Sweden and we had lots from Australia and New Zealand.

'Because the competitors can only use dog paddle, it's all about leg power.'

Run by a team of volunteers, the annual competition is part of a roster of eccentric events held throughout the year at Llanwrtyd Wells, the UK's smallest town, in Powys, mid Wales.

It also hosts the Man Versus Horse Marathon and a bog snorkelling triathlon, which includes a seven-and-a-half mile run and a 19-mile bike ride, as well as two lengths of the infamous bog.

The same two trenches, home to fish and insects including the harmless but nasty sounding water scorpions, are used every year.
