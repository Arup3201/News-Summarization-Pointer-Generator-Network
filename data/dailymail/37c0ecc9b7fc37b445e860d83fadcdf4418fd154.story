Russia has poured scorn on Ukraine's new leaders, questioning their authority and saying they came to power as a result of an 'armed mutiny'.

It came after Ukraine's newly-appointed interim interior 
minister said an arrest warrant had been issued for ousted 
President Viktor Yanukovych.

The fugitive leader, who was voted out of power by Ukraine's parliament on Saturday, was last seen in the Crimean port city of Sevastopol and is rumoured to be taken under Russian protection.

Today, Russia's prime minister Dmitry Medvedev launched his country's strongest attack yet on Yanukovych's successors.

Russia, angered at the loss of its political ally, has already recalled its ambassador for consultation.

Speaking in the Winter Olympics host city of Sochi, Mr Medvedev suggested that Western countries were mistaken about the legitimacy of Ukraine's new 
authorities.

Quoted by Russian news 
agencies, he said: 'Strictly speaking, there is no-one for us to communicate with there today. The legitimacy of a whole number of organs of power that function there raises great doubts.

'Some
 of our foreign, Western partners think otherwise. This is some kind of 
aberration of perception when people call legitimate what is essentially
 the result of an armed mutiny.'

Yanukovych set
off a wave of protests by shelving an agreement with the EU in November
and turning toward Russia, and the movement quickly expanded its 
grievances to corruption, human rights abuses and calls for Yanukovych's
resignation.

Yanukovych fled the capital for eastern Ukraine after signing an agreement with the opposition to end a conflict that turned deadly. Ukraine's border service said he tried to fly out of the country on Saturday from Donetsk but was stopped by their officials.

The 
speaker of parliament assumed the president's powers on Sunday. Ukraine's parliament has until Tuesday to form a new unity government.

Tensions have been mounting in Crimea,
 where pro-Russian politicians are organising rallies and forming 
protest units and have been demanding autonomy from Kiev.

maintains a big naval base in Crimea that has tangled relations between 
the countries for two decades.

Interim interior minister Arsen Avakov 
said on Facebook that a criminal case had been opened against Mr 
Yanukovych and other officials over 'mass murder of peaceful citizens'.

Yanukovich
 had left a private residence in Balaclava, in the Russian-speaking 
Crimea region, for an unknown destination in a car with one of his aides
 on Saturday, Avakov said.

EU foreign affairs chief Catherine 
Ashton has arrived in Kiev to discuss financial and political support 
for Ukraine's new leaders.

Ukraine is in danger of defaulting on its debts as a Russian aid package now seems unlikely to proceed.

Baroness
 Ashton began her visit by laying flowers in Independence Square to 
those killed in clashes between protesters and police.

Meanwhile, Ukraine's parliament appointed Stepan Kubiv, a member of parliament with experience in banking, as the new chairman of the central bank.

A total of 310 deputies in the 450 seat chamber backed Kubiv after his predecessor, Ihor Sorkin, resigned following the overthrow of Yanukovich.
