Justin Bieber’s pet monkey has been given a new home at an animal park in Germany after the teen pop sensation failed to collect him from customs.

Baby capuchin Mally was seized by German officials in March when the Canadian singer was unable to provide vaccination and import papers for his monkey.

Mally is now settling in at the Serengeti-Park in Hodenhagen where he will soon be able to play with his new capuchin family.

After Justin Bieber failed to reclaim his pet, Mally was sent to the Serengeti-Park, which is home to Germany's only white-headed capuchin family.

The tiny monkey was confiscated at Munich airport when Bieber landed for his European tour.

When Bieber missed the deadline to send the correct documents for Mally, authorities issued an order transferring ownership of the animal to Germany.

Bieber has been under heavy critique from animal experts for keeping such a young monkey as a pet, saying 23-week-old Mally should not have been taken away from his mother until he was a year old.

After spending time at an animal shelter, Mally can now be integrated with others of his species and will no longer have to rely on a teddy for company.

Mally was taken to the park in secret for his protection, but fans will now be able to visit the animal.

‘He will go into our capuchin monkey enclosure which has lots of trees so it will be a bit of a game to try and recognise him,’ said Dr Fabrizio Sepe, Managing Director of the Serengeti Park.

While most animals stay in their transport boxes for the first three days, Dr Sepe says Mally ventured out soon after arrival.

‘He came out straight away and jumped onto the carer's head and was immediately curious about everything.’

Sepe said he had not heard from Bieber but added that he would be happy to give the singer information if he was interested.

Ein affe: The capuchin became property of Germany when Bieber missed the deadline to reclaim his pet, a 19th birthday present

Justin Bieber's management has not indicated whether the star will visit his former pet, a 19th birthday present.

'We are making all necessary preparations in order to ensure that Mally has the best possible transition to his new home and has no problems integrating with others of his species’.

Due to statutory regulations, Mally first has to be put into a 25-day quarantine before he is allowed to join his new family - and he already has a sibling rival.

His new family is made up of three males and three females with the latest addition, Molly, born in February, making Molly and Mally of similar age, much to the delight of the staff at the park.

‘That works out well. We are convinced that the integration will go off without a hitch’, Dr Sepe said.
