The man Newsweek claimed is the creator of bitcoin has hired a lawyer in an attempt to clear his name, repeating a denial he made more than a week ago that he has never had anything to do with the digital currency.

In a statement issued by his lawyer, Ethan Kirschner, Dorian Satoshi Nakamoto said Monday that he did not 'create, invent or otherwise work on' bitcoin.

In the magazine's return to print this month after more than a year, Newsweek's cover story declared Nakamoto the 'face behind bitcoin'.

Nakamoto, 64, did not say whether he plans to sue the magazine.

'I'm not him': Satoshi Nakamoto, the man named by Newsweek as the creator of Bitcoin, has now hired a lawyer in an attempt to have the article retracted. He has not said whether he plans to sue the magazine

Statement: Dorian Satoshi Nakamoto has gone to great lengths to prove he is not the creator of bitcoin, and today released this statement

In a statement made public early this morning, Dorian Satoshi Nakamoto, the subject of NewsweekÂ¿s controversial Bitcoin cover story, continued to deny any involvement with the currency, noting that he is 'writing this statement to clear [his] name'

The creator of bitcoin - which has just installed its first ATM in Singapore (pictured) - was named as 'Satoshi Nakamoto', who created a complex form of electronic cash several years. Nakamoto says he is not that man

Nakamoto repeated that he had not heard of bitcoin until his son told him a reporter asked about it in mid-February.

He said he has not been able to find steady work for 10 years and had cancelled his Internet service last year 'due to severe financial distress'.

Nakamoto added that he is trying to recover from prostate surgery in 2012 and a stroke he suffered last October.

'My prospects for gainful employment has been harmed because of Newsweek's article,' he said in the statement.

'Newsweek's false report has been the source of a great deal of confusion and stress for myself, my 93-year-old mother, my siblings, and their families.'

Satoshi Nakamoto, an unemployed computer engineer, says he plans to fight to clear his name of the 'creator of bitcoin' that Newsweek magazine named him as

Newsweek said in a statement that it 'has not received any statement or letter from either Mr. Nakamoto or his legal counsel'.

'If and when we do, we will respond as necessary,' the publication said.

On March 6, the day Newsweek posted its story online, about a dozen journalists descended on the home where Nakamoto lives with his mother in Temple City, Calif.

Nakamoto denied ever being involved with bitcoin multiple times, including during an exclusive two-hour interview with the AP in which he discussed his life, career, family and addressed the assertions in Newsweek's piece.

Newsweek reporter Leah McGrath 
Goodman spend two months searching for the elusive founder of Bitcoin, 
which she identified in a cover story Thursday as 64-year-old Dorian 
Satoshi Nakamoto.

Were they right? Nakamoto affirms he was not the
 founder of Bitcoin, but Newsweek magazine was confident enough to out 
him after two months of research

The
 founder of the digital currency has never come forward, but a proposal 
for the project published online in 2008 is signed by a Satoshi 
Nakamoto, with a corresponding email address.

Goodman
 used the name as a basis for search, and found a man she believed 
matched the founder's profile while looking through registration card of
 naturalized U.S. citizens.

Goodman's
 firmest evidence that the Temple City, California resident known as 
Dorian Satoshi Nakamoto is the real Bitcoin father was when she showed 
up to his house after corresponding with him via email.

She says when she showed up outside the modest home, Nakamoto refused to come to the door but he did peak out of the blinds.

Eventually the police showed up after he called them to say he was scared he would 'get into trouble' for talking to her.

Nakamoto came out when police arrived and Goodman was able to get him to comment once.

'I
 am no longer involved in that and I cannot discuss it,' he said before 
returning inside. 'It's been turned over to other people. They are in 
charge of it now. I no longer have any connection.'

In
 addition to Nakamoto's subtle acknowledgement to Goodman, she also 
interviewed his family and Bitcoin developers to  learn more about the 
mysterious founder.

While
 family members, including two of Nakamoto's children and his estranged 
wife, Goodman interviewed were unaware that he created Bitcoin, they 
also said they wouldn't be surprised it he had and was just keeping it a
 secret.

'
 You're not going to be able to get to him. He'll deny everything. He'll
 never admit to starting Bitcoin,' Nakamoto's youngest brother said.

Goodman
 also spoke with programmers like Gavin Andresen (Bitcoin's current 
Chief Scientist) who corresponded with the person 'or entity' known as 
Nakamoto in the early years of Bitcoin, but he seemed to cease 
communication in early 2011.

'Back
 then, it was not clear that creating Bitcoin might be a legal thing to 
do. He went to great lengths to protect his anonymity,' Andresen said, 
adding that he never heard Nakamoto's voice since he refused to 
communicate over phone.
