Tragic: Christopher Groves, 38, and his nine-year-old son Connor were  killed when their sports car spun off a road flyover and plunged into the freezing River Clyde

A father and his nine-year-old son were killed when their sports car spun off a road flyover and plunged into a freezing river.

Christopher Groves, 38, may have been blinded by the low winter sun when he lost control of his blue Honda S2000 while bringing schoolboy Connor home from a guitar lesson.

Their car shot off a flyover on the A725 near Bothwell Bridge, Lanarkshire, and landed upside down in the icy waters of the River Clyde.

Police divers were called in to pull the father and son from the car, but there was nothing that could be done to save them.

Mr Groves, of Blantyre, Lanarkshire, was a financial advisor and had been married to wife Clare, 39, for 10 years.

Police have confirmed Saturday’s incident is not being treated as suspicious and that no other vehicles were involved.

Mrs Groves, who works for The Royal Bank of Scotland, is being comforted by relatives at their home but was too upset to comment.

Mr Groves's stepfather Trevor Hadley said: 'It’s the worst possible thing that could happen. Clare is in bits. She has lost her husband and son in one go.

'It’s just a few weeks since we spent a wonderful Christmas at their house.

'Connor was a beautiful boy, so full of life and really bright.'

Margaret Mitchell, the MSP for Central Scotland, lives close to where the accident happened.

She said: 'It is hard to understand how this could have happened on that stretch of road.

'Obviously the police will carry out a full investigation into the full circumstances of the case.

'But firstly our thoughts must go to the family involved who will have been devastated by what has happened.'

Officers said the car was travelling from the Raith Interchange, off the M74 near Hamilton, when it swerved off the dual-carriageway around 11.15am on Saturday.

The road was shut for six hours while rescuers used boats and a crane to recover the wrecked vehicle from the river.

Shocked neighbours of the Groves family told of their grief at the accident.

One said: 'Chris and Clare are a lovely couple and Connor was their life.

'They were very friendly and a really nice family.

'Everyone is shocked at what’s happened and really upset for Clare.

'For anyone to lose two members of their family in a terrible accident is so cruel and absolutely devastating.

'I don’t know how she’ll ever recover.'

Floral tributes with messages of condolence were left at the scene of the crash.

One said: 'To Chris and Connor, thank you for the memories till we meet again.

Tributes were also posted on Facebook by stunned friends.

Liz McElhinney said: 'Sadly I knew Chris and Connor they were my neighbours. My heart breaks for his poor wife Clare xxx.'

Ted Forde wrote: 'Connor was in my wee girl’s class at school. Devasting news.'

Elaine Henry, headteacher of Udston Primary, Hamilton, where Connor was a pupil paid tribute to the ‘bright, friendly boy’.

She said: 'The school is shocked and saddened. Connor was valued by all.'

Connor’s school pals were expected to be offered emotional support when they returned to classes today.

Sergeant John Tait of Road Policing at Motherwell said: 'At present we have identified one witness who has observed the events at the time of the vehicle leaving the carriageway and we are satisfied that no other vehicles were involved.

'This has been a tragic Road Traffic Collision and our thoughts are with the family at this sad time.'
