Leaving? Former Polly Peck chief executive Asil Nadir could return to Cyprus or Turkey after it was reported he paid the £5m compensation demanded by the courts

Disgraced tycoon Asil Nadir, who claims to be broke, has reportedly paid £5million in compensation to his devastated investors and could now fly home within months.

Lawyers for the 71-year-old are working to secure a prisoner transfer deal to Turkey, opening the door to his return to Northern Cyprus.

The former Polly Peck boss has found the compensation ordered by an Old Bailey judge last year and is likely to go home less than a year into his ten-year sentence for stealing almost £29million.

Nadir, who is being held at Belmarsh Prison, is claiming to be completely broke, with no assets and no income. His £1million-plus bill for a defence team at the Old Bailey was paid for by legal aid.

The Serious Fraud Office is convinced he has hidden his money as he has rented a £21,000 per month Mayfair home while employing a driver and security. But he claims his family paid for it all.

His glamorous second wife Nur, 28, 
spent his trial shopping in designer West End stores and riding horses 
before leaving the country when he was jailed.

But the outstanding £5million compensation has been met by his friend, airline magnate Hamit Cankut bagana, Nadir's supporters have said.

The Times said today that Nadir, who has Turkish and British citizenship, will try to head to Turkey and negotiations between the two countries about repatriation are at an advanced stage.

Last month a source close to negotiations told the Mail that 
Nadir is desperate to get out of Britain.

He
added: ‘The suggestion is that once in Turkey he will quickly return to
Northern Cyprus to serve his time under “house arrest” if at all.’

If he does leave it will anger tens of thousands of investors who lost money when his empire collapsed in 1990.

And any deal would have to be signed off at Secretary of State level by Chris Grayling – a move which could be politically toxic because of Nadir’s history with the Tory party.

In the 1980s Nadir donated £440,000 to the Conservative Party which it has refused to return despite his conviction.

Allowing him to go home might leave the Government open to charges it was doing a favour for a disgraced former party donor.

Nadir returned to Britain from his 
home in Northern Cyprus to ‘clear his name’ in 2010 after fleeing in 
1993 before he went on trial.

Last August he was convicted of stealing £28.6million from his Polly Peck International textile empire.

An
Old Bailey jury found he raided the company to pay for his 
multi-million property empire, racehorses, antiques, fast cars and 
jewellery.

The 22-year Serious Fraud Office investigation and complex trial is estimated to have cost taxpayers more than £20million.

He was ordered to pay £5million in compensation or face a further six years in jail.

Giving him two years to pay up, Mr Justice Holroyde rejected his claims of poverty.

But
the fraudster escaped a colossal potential compensation bill of 
£61million for pensioners and shareholders who lost their life savings.

Nadir’s lawyer, Giles Bark-Jones, was unavailable for comment.

A Legal Services Commission spokesman said: 'Legal aid is taxpayers’ money and we are continuing to do everything we can to ensure that Asil Nadir pays back what he owes in legal costs.'
