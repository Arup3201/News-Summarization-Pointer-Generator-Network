More than 64,000 operations in NHS hospitals in England were cancelled last year - the highest figure for a decade.

New figures show that 64,192 planned operations were scrapped at the last minute in 2013/14 - none of them for clinical reasons.

The next highest annual total of cancelled procedures was 68,569 in 2004/05.

Andy Burnham has accused David Cameron of being 'shockingly complacent' about the NHS

Other figures from NHS England show that the NHS missed the four hour waiting time target for A&E units.

Waiting times were worst in major A&E wards where just 92.2 per cent of patients were seen within four hours.

Data for all emergency departments, including minor injuries units and urgent care centres, shows they also narrowly failed to meet the 95 per cent target, with 94.9 per cent seen in four hours.

Andy Burnham MP, Labour’s Shadow Health Secretary, said ‘David Cameron was boasting about the performance of the NHS this week, but these figures show he is shockingly complacent and completely out of touch with what is happening on the frontline.

There were 64,192 planned operations cancelled in 2013/14 none of them for clinical reasons

‘It’s getting harder to see a GP, tens of thousands of operations have been cancelled and we’ve just had the worst year in A&E for a decade with almost a million patients waiting longer than four hours.

‘There’s only one person to blame for the crisis in our NHS and that’s David Cameron. He wasted £3 billion and caused chaos with a damaging NHS reorganisation he promised wouldn’t happen.’
