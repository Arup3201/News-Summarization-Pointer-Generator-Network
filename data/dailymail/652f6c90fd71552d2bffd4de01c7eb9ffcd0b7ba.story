Browns Quarterback Johnny Manziel has entered a rehabilitation facility, it was revealed today. 

Brad Beckworth, a Manziel family adviser, confirmed Monday that that the 22-year-old NFL star entered an unspecified rehab facility Wednesday.

'Johnny knows there are areas in which he needs to improve in order to be a better family member, friend and teammate and he thought the off-season was the right time to take this step,' said Beckworth.

In treatment: Hard-partying Browns Quarterback Johnny Manziel entered a rehabilitation facility Wednesday 

Party boy: Manziel's hard-partying and off-the-field antics were well known while he was in college

'On behalf of Johnny and his family, we’re asking for privacy until he rejoins the team in Cleveland.'

Browns general manager Ray Farmer also spoke out Monday about Manziel's decision to seek treatment:

'We respect Johnny's initiative in this decision and will fully support him throughout this process. Our players' health and well-being will always be of the utmost importance to the Cleveland Browns. 

'We continually strive to create a supportive environment and provide the appropriate resources, with our foremost focus being on the individual and not just the football player. 

'Johnny's privacy will be respected by us during this very important period and we hope that others will do the same. 

ESPN reported that according to a source close to Manziel, the athlete is expected to be in treatment for at least a few weeks.

Alarming: A photo snapped of Manziel before the start of the season and later posted to Instagram showed the footballer at a bar in the process of tightly rolling up a dollar bill while standing over a sink counter

A source told ESPN's Darren Rovell Manziel was offered six figures by a Las Vegas casino to host a Super Bowl party Sunday, but he rejected the proposition. 

Manziel's escapades  involving alcohol-fueled parties have been well-documented beginning from his time as a Heisman Trophy winner at Texas A&M, where he excelled on the field.

In late December, the football star was photographed chugging champagne straight out of a bottle poolside at a Miami hotel.

The incident came just days after Manziel, who was nursing a hamstring injury at the time, was fined for skipping out on a treatment session and walk-through for the last game of the season because he overslept after throwing a massive party in his mansion the night before.

A source told ESPN that player was found at home 'drunk off his a**.'  

Manziel has denied organizing a party but was quick to apologize to the team for his antics, saying; 'It’s about being accountable and doing what I'm gonna say instead of looking like a jackass.'

He added: 'Either I’m going to learn or I’m going to be finding something else to do.' 

'Aha' moment: In a press conference December 29, Manziel said he plans to be accountable for his actions instead of looking like a jackass  

Appearing on ESPN’s First Take to talk about Manziel's conduct, sports columnist Skip Bayless said the former college star must do something about his drinking.

'My concern, I repeatedly said, was if Johnny continues to demonstrate that he has a problem with alcohol, and a problem with alcohol leading to partying and all that that entails, then I’m going to be out,' said Bayless.

Manziel was known for his partying while in college, but said he was a changed man during the 2014 NFL Draft, noting that he had 'grown up,' before being selected 22nd overall by Cleveland.

Just days into his training with the Browns, however, the local press began calling him out on his partying, which they cited as the major reason for his lackluster performance on the field.

Also causing alarm before the season even began was a photo snapped of Manziel and later posted to Instagram that showed the footballer at a bar in the process of tightly rolling up a dollar bill while standing over a sink counter, leading some to suggest that he might have been snorting cocaine.

In a press conference December 23, Manziel said his goal was to become 'the guy' for the team and take the job more seriously. 

Four days later, he failed to show up for a walk-through in Baltimore after allegedly getting drunk.

Distracted: Manziel, 22, played most of the season as a back-up to Brian Hoyer, starting just two games 

Manziel played in five games as a rookie, starting only two, and completed 18 of 35 passes for 175 yards with no touchdowns and two interceptions. Currently, the 22-year-old has a four-year contract with the Browns worth about $8.25million.

Manziel also has some of the most lucrative endorsement deals in the sports world with, among others, Nike, McDonald's, MusclePharm, and Snickers.

In late January, ESPN published a story in which some of Manziel's teammates were critical of their quarterback's work ethic. 

One member of the Browns team said that Manziel thought his rookie season was a '100 per cent joke.'
