Queensland's attorney-general will appeal the two-month suspended jail sentence handed to a Gold Coast woman who attacked an elderly, vision-impaired man on a bus.

Attorney-General Jarrod Bleijie said the sentence given to Larna Watmough - who pleaded guilty to seriously assaulting a person over 60 last month - as 'manifestly inadequate'.

Watmough and her 17-year-old co-accused Layni Cameron stirred national outrage in February when footage of the attack on Paul Buttigieg, 77, on a bus in the Gold Coast suburb of Kirra in Queensland went viral.

Queensland's Attorney-General Jarrod Bleijie will be appealing the sentence of Larna Watmough, 21

The Director of Public Prosecutions will act on Mr Bleijie's behalf in Queensland's district court. 

While handing down his sentence, Magistrate Gary Finger labelled the pair as 'louts' and 'idiots' for their behaviour.

'You attacked a defenceless old man with impaired vision... you certainly must be proud of yourself,' he said.

'Your response to his comment can only be described as appalling.

Mr Bleijie said Watmough's two-month suspended sentence for attacking Paul Buttigieg, 77, was 'manifestly inadequate'

'Your actions were deplorable. To say they were deplorable is an understatement.'

In the video, Watmough could be seen kicking and punching Mr Buttigieg as she and another woman hurled verbal abuse at him.

Onlookers yelled for the women to stop and 'leave the poor man alone', before another male passenger eventually stepped in and forced the offenders off the bus.

The women had earlier been shown to yell obscenities at several passengers on the bus.

Larna Watmough, who pleaded guilty for her part in the vicious assault on the 77-year-old man last month, was given a two-month prison sentence which was wholly suspended for 18 months at Southport Magistrates Court.

Watmough presented a handwritten note to the court apologising to the man for the incident.

The two-page letter told of her regret about the shocking attack which also saw her receive a 12-month probation for the public nuisance charge and ordered to pay $500 in compensation.

'If I could go back and walk off the bus I would,' the letter said.

'My actions that day were completely out of character,' it said. 

'All (sic) though its seems like I'm that person, I can assure you that I'm not.' 

Watmough was also heckled outside her sentence hearing at Southport Magistrates Court.

Her co-accused Layni Cameron had the case against her adjourned to a later date.
