Jack Wilshere has always possessed the skill and technique to be an international footballer. The question marks only ever concerned whether he would be studious enough to read the game at the highest level and whether his body would stand up to the physical strain.

All the signs are that the 22-year-old is maturing into a player who could yet develop into an established talent at the top of the game.

Firstly there are those injury issues. Wilshere’s ankles appeared to be the major impediment to his development over recent years but with a good pre-season behind him, Wilshere has been almost ever present for Arsenal and has started all three England games.

Then there is his game intelligence. 

He is at heart an instinctive player but in conversation with Wilshere at England’s hotel in Watford on Friday afternoon, his willingness to study the game is evident.

Roy Hodgson and the England coaches have been encouraging him to watch the best holding midfielders in the world as part of his education and it seems he has been assiduous in doing his homework.

‘I have been watching Xabi Alonso on video in the past couple of weeks,’ said Wilshere. ‘He had a record number of passes in one game, nearly 200 in one match, which is ridiculous. Watching players like him and Andrea Pirlo, you learn how clever they are how intelligent they are on the ball.

‘In that role it’s important you have to understand that if you lose the ball, the opposition are in a dangerous position to counter-attack. Whereas if I was playing a little bit higher, on the edge of the box, you can lose it and you have players around who can get the ball back. You learn how they use the ball and you learn when it’s a good time to dribble or sometimes pass. I enjoy playing that role. I enjoy getting on the ball and starting attacks.’

Wilshere may have to get used to it. Against San Marino, he thrived in the second half in the holding role and England lack a natural midfielder to play there. Wilshere is being encouraged to make the position his own.

‘I get the clips through on my iPad. The analyst guys here send them to me and they highlight some of his key points, his key strengths. It’s only 20-25 minutes. That’s part and parcel of learning. Even when I watch my games back, I think: “What am I doing now? I should have done that!” It was my second game in that position against San Marino and I thought: “I’ve already improved.” So there’s a lot more to come from me in that position, but the more I watch players like that, the quicker I’ll learn.’

Wilshere conveys a degree of humility which, for English football, is encouraging. It will be some time before a collection of England players inspire a nation burnt by a decade of failures but, after the dismal World Cup, the win in Switzerland was at least a building block for this group.

‘As players now, we don’t have to worry about the past,’ said Wilshere. ‘Basically all the players from that golden generation have now stopped playing at international level, so there’s a space for us to come in and write some history ourselves, if you like. We’re young, we’re eager, we want to learn, and we want to win something with England. At the end of the day, that’s the main thing. We want to get through this qualification and go to the Euros and really do something.

‘We are not worried about what you call England’s poor record. All we can do is concentrate on the games ahead and what we can do. We are on a good run and we want to continue the good form from the Switzerland game. 

‘I thought we did that against San Marino. The captain [Wayne Rooney] wants that togetherness; he wants us to come together at the beginning of the game.’

No one will ever be foolish enough to tag a generation of England players with exorbitant expectations again, the scars of the golden generation’s failures still raw. But there is something fresh and vibrant about this group of players. Like all young people, they have a healthy disrespect for what’s gone before, intent on forging their own futures

‘There are a lot of players who have come through the England Under 21s together, who are now in the seniors,’ said Wilshere. 

‘We are good friends off the pitch and we are of a similar age. We have really worked on team spirit and I think you can see that in matches. Win or lose, we always stick together.

‘I played with Jordan Henderson for a number of years. He’s a close mate of mine. And I grew up with Jonjo Shelvey at Arsenal [Shelvey started his youth career at Arsenal]. Frank Lampard and Steven Gerrard were fantastic for England — and I looked up to them even from when I was a young kid, and to play with them in an England game was a dream come true for me — but now they’ve moved on.

‘Before the Switzerland game people were questioning: “Are they ready?” I think we prove every game that we’re learning. As young English players at the top level, there’s no better place to learn. As each game goes on, I think we’re getting closer and better as a team and I think there’s a lot more to come.’

Talking to Wilshere, it’s hard to accept that idea that younger players have no enthusiasm for their international careers. The Arsenal player’s eyes light up a little when he is asked whether he can imagine winning 100 caps for his country —he has 23 at present — as Rooney will next month. ‘Yes, of course. Even when I was growing up I looked up to people like that. I remember growing up watching the Euros in 2004 and Rooney was there, Gerrard was there, Lampard was there and all of a sudden I was involved with them when I was 18. 

‘They’ve been great role models for me. Wayne’s fantastic. He’s only 28. He’s a great leader, he’s always talking to us. He deserves 100 caps. He’s been fantastic. His goal-scoring record is fantastic and his love for the game — everyone can see it. He’s such a great role model.

‘He’s the only one now who has been playing for England for 10 years, with the likes of Gerrard. He’s been through that generation. Now he really feels like, he’s the dad figure if you like. He puts his arm around us, brings us together and gets us going.’

It may take some time before anyone gets over-excited about England again. But if Wilshere and his team-mates keep up their homework, perhaps we can expect a graduation ceremony sooner rather later.

Jack Wilshere won glowing praise for his role as England’s holding midfielder against San Marino, but he admits he’s still got plenty to learn if he wants to eclipse the master of the art, Xabi Alonso. Wilshere described as 'ridiculous' a recent match in which Bayern Munich star Alonso completed an astonishing 204 passes against Cologne — that’s 117 more than Wilshere managed during his man-of-the-match display at Wembley. Listed are the two midfielders’ stats from those two matches, figures which reveal the ex-Liverpool schemer is in a class of his own.
