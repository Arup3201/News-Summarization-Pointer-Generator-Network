The body of a 22-year-old man who went missing after a country music concert five days ago has been found in a dumpster at a landfill facility.

Cory Barron was last seen at a Jason Aldean concert at Cleveland's Progressive Field with family and friends on Friday night.

He was found dead in a dump truck at Lorain County Landfill on Tuesday afternoon. The truck had just completed a garbage route in Cleveland.

Now police are investigating the possibility he died after falling down a garbage chute at the stadium - a five to six-story drop.

'I'm not going to speculate at this point,' Cleveland Police Commander James Chura told WKYC.

'Looks like he could have fallen into the dumpster or crawled in there or something. It is still under investigation... We just got to see where it's going to go.'

He said police are still treating the case as a 'dead body investigation' rather than a homicide.

'We're checking the scene. The dead body was found in the dumpster, so we're looking at all the access points to the dumpster... throughout the building,' he said.

He added the investigation will become clearer once Lorain County Coroner's office completes an autopsy. 

Police said Barron had no obvious injuries, and was found with his wallet and concert ticket stub.

News of the death has devastated friends and family who reported Barron, a former high school football player, missing on Saturday afternoon.

'Help us remember Cory for the beyond amazing, caring, and loving young man that I was so blessed to have as my brother for 22 years,' Barron's sister, Britta Barron, wrote on Facebook.

On Tuesday evening, just hours after Barron was found, about 100 mourners gathered at Fremont Ross High School - Barron's former high school.

The group joined hands and formed a circle in the parking lot as Jim Gippert, pastor of New Hope Vineyard Church, led a prayer, Sandusky Register reported.

'Cory would’ve made a difference in our 
community, our state, our country,' Fremont Ross parent, Mike Dukeshire, said.

'He was going to be a
 difference-maker. Whatever he chose to do, he was going to do it well. If the shoe were on the other foot, Cory would be standing right here, with all of us.'

Country singer Jason Aldean, whose concert Barron attended on Friday, tweeted his condolences.

'My sincere condolences go out to Cory Barron’s family and friends. My heart is heavy for you all and you are in my thoughts and prayers,' the singer wrote.

The Cleveland Indians, which uses Progressive Field where Barron was last seen, released a statement: 'The Cleveland Indians are saddened by the news of Cory Barron's untimely death and wish to extend their sincere condolences to the Barron family and friends.

'We are cooperating with the authorities in their investigation and do not have additional comment at this time.'

Police searched for Barron by air, car and foot before his body was found at the landfill facility by a worker.
