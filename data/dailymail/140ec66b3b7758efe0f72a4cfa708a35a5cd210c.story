Barcelona coach Luis Enrique is optimistic that holding midfielder Sergio Busquets can recover from injury in time for Sunday's El Clasico match against Real Madrid at the Nou Camp. 

Enrique said on Saturday that Busquets 'isn't 100 percent but he will be there' for the clash against Barca's rivals in what could be a potential decider for the league title. 

Busquets has been sidelined for the last three games since injuring his right ankle against Villarreal in the Copa del Rey.

Javier Mascherano has played in his place and would do so again against Madrid if Busquets isn't fit enough. 

Barca go into El Clasico off the back of six consecutive victories in all competitions, the last of those confirming Premier League side Manchester City's exit from the Champions League. 

Madrid, meanwhile, arrested their mini slump of three games without a win after a 2-0 triumph over Levante, courtesy of a brace from Gareth Bale.
