The sheet metal firm standing in the way of Tottenham Hotspur's £400 million stadium redevelopment has suffered 'bomb threats', according to the owners. 

Archway Sheet Metal Works Ltd stands alongside the club's White Hart Lane ground in north London, on the last patch of land the club needs to start work on its new 56,000-plus capacity stadium. 

The family-run firm was issued with a compulsory purchase order (CPO) in 2012, but argues that the Premier League club is unlawfully trying to force it out of the premises, according to submissions from the company to the High Court.  

Archway Sheet Metal Works, which is located next to White Hart Lane on the last patch of land Tottenham Hotspur need for their stadium development is arguing at the High Court that the compulsory purchase order it has been issued with is unlawful

Archway was issued with a compulsory purchase order (CPO) in 2012, but argues this is invalid, and is asking a judge to quash the enforcement which would enable the club to buy the 25,000 sq ft site

Archway, which is owned by Tottenham fan Josif Josif, 46, was gutted by fire in a suspected arson attack, and Mr Josif says his firm has been subjected to bomb threats. 

The London Borough of Haringey made the compulsory purchase order in March 2012 and it was confirmed by the Communities Secretary in July 2014 following a public inquiry. 

The company argues that the compulsory purchase order is invalid, and is asking a High Court judge to quash the enforcement which would enable the club to buy the 25,000 sq ft site.

If the application succeeds it would be a major blow to the controversial plans for the new stadium complex. 

As well as challenging the legality of the CPO itself, Archway argues that proposed new changes to the Spurs project have come to light which are so substantial that they 'alter the viability case made at the inquiry' and further undermine the order.

The new proposals involve 'massive intensification of the scheme' - making it substantially different from the project for which the CPO was obtained.

Tottenham, who take on Fiorentina in the Europa League this Thursday, already has planning permission for the new 56,000-plus capacity stadium it hopes to open for the 2018/19 season (artists impression)

Christopher Lockhart-Mummery QC, appearing for Archway, is submitting to the judge that an application for disclosure of documents held by Tottenham Hotspur Ltd has revealed the extent of the changes.

The QC said in written submissions that the Premier League Club dismissed these as matters of 'minutiae' within 'a sea of detail' which was 'irrelevant'.

However, the Tottenham documents in fact revealed discussions had taken place involving an updated design of the Spurs stadium and increasing its capacity by 5,000.

Last November, a mystery fire gutted the Archway premises, which is alongside White Hart Lane's North Stand. The owners also say they have received 'bomb threats'

Other potential improvements included an increase in residential development, incorporating 900 units in five blocks, plus 60,000 square feet of commercial development space and a medical centre and a 30,000 square feet gym and fitness centre.

Mr Lockhart-Mummery says the proposals reveal the scheme is now potentially on 'a substantially different scale', raising substantial new issues as to its viability.

Discussion of the new proposals, says the QC, have taken place between Haringey Council and Tottenham Hotspur Ltd and representatives 'at high levels of Government', including UK Trade and Investment and HM Treasury, as well as the Greater London Authority (GLA) and Transport for London. 

The owners of the firm have been in a dispute with Spurs for the last decade over its redevelopment plans

Mr Justice Dove, who has revealed he is an Aston Villa fan, has been told by Archway lawyers that the police are currently investigating a suspected case of arson.

The owners say they have received 'bomb threats'.

Mr Josif who runs the family business, said at the time of the fire: 'People were calling us and threatening us and we were receiving bomb threats and that started a few months ago, but we don't know if that's got anything to do with it.'

The firm describes itself as a 'wonderfully old-fashioned family business' producing metal items for the catering and hospitality industry.

The owners have been in a dispute with Spurs for the last decade over its redevelopment plans.

Tottenham want to build the new capacity stadium next to the existing White Hart Lane ground, where they have played since 1899, which holds just over 36,000. 

Spurs hope that moving to a larger, state-of-the-art stadium with an increased capacity will help bring in more revenue, making it easier to compete with top European clubs.

North London rivals Arsenal moved into their 60,272-capacity Emirates Stadium in 2006.

The club, who take on Fiorentina in the Europa League this Thursday, already has planning permission for the new stadium it hopes to open for the 2018/19 season, after Archway's move to challenge the decision in the High Court resulted in a revised construction programme.

The club was said to be considering moving to a temporary home for a season during the construction period. Options mooted included Wembley and the Olympic Stadium, while reports of a move to stadium:mk in Milton Keynes were met unfavourably by many fans.

A Tottenham club spokesman said: 'We have already successfully and amicably relocated more than 70 businesses in the area to the satisfaction of all parties concerned and a number of these organisations continue to reside in the borough.

'Whilst we were able to accommodate all these other businesses' requests, in the instance of Archway, we have been unable to reach agreement over the period of the last seven years.'
