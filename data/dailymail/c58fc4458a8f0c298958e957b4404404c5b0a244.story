Michael Clarke is selling his Lilli Pilli home

Australia cricket captain Michael Clarke's property portfolio is set to take a dive with this stunning  Sydney mansion expected to sell for less than the 2006 price he paid for it.

Clarke, who recently bought an $8.5 million mansion with wife Kyly, has the  1,667sqm of waterfront property in Sydney's southern suburb of LilIi Pilli listed with McGrath Real Estate and it is forecasted to sell for $2.7 million at auction.

If it reaches the clearance price, Clarke, who failed to sell the home for $3.4 million in 2009 will make a $170,000 loss on the $2.87 million home he paid for eight years ago.

The contemporary five-bedroom home, Clarke's first investment property, is located in the Sutherland Shire close to where Australia's middle order batsman's parents live.

Among its hallmark features it boasts a stunning national park backdrop and sweeping riverfront views and four bathrooms. The split-level property also comes with pool, spa and boatshed.

Clarke and wife Kyly moved out of their Bondi base earlier this year into the newly acquired Vaucluse home, also in Sydney's east.

The pair paid $8.5 million for the property after the previous owners agreed to drop the price down from $9.5 million.
