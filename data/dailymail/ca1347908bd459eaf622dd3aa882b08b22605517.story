A couple were horrified to discover a baby rat cooking in their toaster as they made breakfast after smelling the rodent's hair burning. 

Jason Clark was preparing the meal with his wife Victoria when the 33-year-old noticed a 'disgusting' smell coming from the toaster. 

With a burning smell filling their flat in Peacehaven, East Sussex, the rodent squeaked and jumped out from the appliance as the two pieces of bread popped up. 

Jason and Victoria Clark were horrified when the tiny rodent squeaked and jumped out of the toaster along with two pieces of bread as they made breakfast 

It is the latest in a string of rat sightings in their home, he said.

'I thought the smell was odd because my toast couldn't have burned that quickly, so went over to have a look.

'I popped the toast back up, and couldn't believe it when a rat squeaked and jumped out, then ran away behind the boiler.

'The rat hadn't made a sound when I put the toaster down and it’s only a small toaster.

'I threw the toaster away immediately but the experience hasn't put me off toast - but I make sure I check inside my new toaster before I use it.'

Earlier this year Mr Clark had to go to hospital after being bitten by a rat as he took washing up liquid out of a cupboard under the sink. 

Jason and Victoria Clark said their flat has been infested with rodents for months and that they can hear them when they are in bed 

The couple have laid traps in their flat but say there has been no improvement. Their housing association is investigating the issue

His 25-year-old wife, meanwhile, said they have trouble sleeping with the sound of the rodents in the walls. 

Orchard and Shipman, the housing association through which the couple rent their home, is investigating the alleged rat infestation.  

'We have a pest control company attending the property and the baiting process has been ongoing on a weekly basis since early October. 

'Once specialist investigations confirm the source, we will liaise to get the necessary works carried out immediately,' a spokesman said.
