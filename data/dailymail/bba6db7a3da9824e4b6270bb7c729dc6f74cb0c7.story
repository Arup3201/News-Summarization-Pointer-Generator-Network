Chelsea's celebrations of their 110th anniversary this weekend will include a special commemorative matchday programme, featuring a design based on one from the olden days.

The club was formed at a meeting in the Rising Sun pub  March 10 1905 before going on to become a super power in both the Premier League and Europe.

After their controversial midweek exit to Paris Saint Germain in the Champions, Jose Mourinho's league leaders face Southampton at Stamford Bridge on Sunday.

Special guests in the Directors’ Box will be six direct descendants of three founding fathers of the club: Joseph Mears, Edwin Janes and Fred Parker, who also edited the Chelsea Chronicle, as the programme was called back then.

It is fitting that Southampton should be the visitors for this landmark game since George Thomas, a former Saints board member and builder and owner of the Dell, was also one of the first directors of Chelsea FC in 1905.

‘It’s been an amazing journey. I’ve enjoyed every bit of it. I’ve worked with some great people, great players from when I came to the ones that are here now. They’ve all been brilliant.’
