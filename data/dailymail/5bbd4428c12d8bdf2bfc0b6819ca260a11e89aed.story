Scott Greer Bybee, the 26-year-old son of 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals Judge Jay Bybee (pictured), fatally shot himself at a Mormon temple in Las Vegas

A 26-year-old who committed suicide at a Mormon temple has been revealed as the son of a federal judge.

Scott Greer Bybee shot himself dead at the temple in east Las Vegas on Tuesday night. He is the son of 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals Judge Jay Bybee.

His family called police beforehand because they feared the 26-year-old was on his way to the temple to take his own life. 

Las Vegas Police Department spokesman Lt. Mark Reddon told the Review-Journal that Bybee was found with what appeared to be a self-inflicted gunshot wound in the temple's garden.

Worshippers were inside the temple at the time attending an evening service.

A friend of the family told the newspaper that the judge's son suffered from long-term depression.

The family had sought advice and treatment for their son.

Family spokesman Judge Milan Smith released a statement which read: 'It 
will take time for Jay, Dianna, and their other family members, to begin
the healing process, but they will be grateful for your prayers and 
good wishes on their behalf.'

Scott Bybee is the son of Jay Bybee and his wife of 27 years, Dianna, a high school teacher. 

The coroner had not confirmed a cause of death for Scott Bybee and details of a memorial service have not yet been announced.

Judge Bybee is a lifelong member of the The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. He served a mission for the church in Santiago, Chile from 1973 - 1975. He studied law at Brigham Young University in Utah.

Judge Bybee, 60, is well-known as the lawmaker who signed the 'torture memo' in August 2002 when he was former assistant attorney general under George W. Bush.

The
memo allowed for techniques such as water-boarding to be used along 
with other brutal interrogation methods on suspected Al Qaeda terrorists at Guantanamo Bay and Abu Ghraib prison.

The methods were considered torture by Amnesty
International, Human Rights Watch and many of America's allies. 

Bush nominated Bybee for the Court of Appeals on in January 2003 and he was confirmed by the U.S. Senate two months later.
