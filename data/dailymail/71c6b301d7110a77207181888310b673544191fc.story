Michael Clarke and Australia's players have visited a plaque mounted at the SCG in memory to the late Phillip Hughes ahead of an emotional return to the ground where their team-mate was fatally struck.

A bronze plaque has been mounted on the members' stand at the SCG commemorating Hughes, who was killed after being hit on the head by a bouncer while batting for South Australia in Sydney in November last year.

Australia face India in the fourth Test on Tuesday with many players returning to the venue where their team-mate was felled. Brad Haddin, Nathan Lyon, Shane Watson and David Warner were all fielding at the time when he was struck and fell to the ground unconscious.

Steve Smith, Australia's stand-in captain in the absence of the injured Michael Clarke, praised the plaque, which details Hughes's achievements in cricket and his centuries scored at the SCG.

'I think it's great,' said Smith of the tribute to the Macksille-born batsman, who was just 25 when he died in circumstances that shocked the world.

'We've just to make sure we're very respectful to the Hughes family that are going to be down here for this Test match.

'I think that's very important to us and very important to them.'

'Hughesy was one of us, he was a good mate.

'To be able to walk past that and see the little fella... it'll give us some inspiration as we're going out on the field.'

Opening batsman David Warner admitted he is unsure how he will feel when he plays at the SCG for the first time since the death of his team-mate and friend.

Warner was close to Hughes and is not sure how he will feel when he is out in the middle where Hughes was hit by a Sean Abbott bouncer.

'I know when I go to face up at that Randwick End I'm going to be looking down at that spot,' Warner said.

'It's going to be tough but I've got to try and hold back the emotions and do what I do for the team and try and score runs,' he added.

'But every time I come here, every time I walk out on the field, every time I've got nothing on my mind I'm going to be thinking about it.'

PHILLIP HUGHES

1988-2014

Macksville-born Phillip Hughes became the youngest man

to score a century in a Sheffield Shield final when he posted 116

at the SCG during NSW's win against Victoria in 2007-08.

 

The dashing and unorthodox left-handed batsman had earned

his first NSW cap earlier that season, aged just 18.

Hughes made three more first-class centuries at the SCG,

having quickly become a crowd favourite.

The boy from Macksville also became a hugely popular member of the world's

cricketing elite, forging friendships at home and abroad as fast as he accumulated runs.

 

Hughes scored 9023 first-class runs at 46.51, compiling 26 hundreds from 114 matches.

He became Australia's 408th Test player during the 2008-09 tour of

South Africa - a series in which he also became the youngest player to post centuries

in both innings of a Test, and this, in only his second ever Test match.

He played three Tests at the SCG, narrowly missing a century in the

2012-13 summer when dismissed for 87 against Sri Lanka.

Hughes faced his last ball on 25 November 2014,

playing for South Australia against NSW at the SCG.

His death two days later united the sporting world in grief, with Cricket Australia

declaring him 63 not out forever - his final score at the SCG. His funeral in his

home town was attended by thousands, with many more watching from the SCG.
