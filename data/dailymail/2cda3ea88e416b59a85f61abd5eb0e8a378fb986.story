A schoolboy was raped in a busy department store after being threatened by two men.

The 14-year-old was wandering around a shopping centre after travelling into a city centre on a Saturday afternoon.

He was using a public toilet in the mall when he became aware of two men staring at him.

Inquiry: Police want to speak to these men in connection with an attack on a 14-year-old boy, who was raped in a department store in Manchester

Suddenly one of the men approached him and said: ‘Come with us, do what we say and if you try to run, we’ll get you.’

The boy was then frogmarched by the men – one white and the other Asian – out of the Arndale Centre in Manchester.

Led by the arm, he was forcibly taken 
about 50 yards away to the nearby Debenhams store. As shoppers and staff
 walked around the four-storey department store, oblivious to the boy’s 
ordeal, the teenager was forced into a lift by the two men.

He was taken by the lift upstairs, where he was marched into a men’s toilet and raped by the Asian man.

Yesterday a police source said the 
attack was ‘absolutely horrendous’. The source said: ‘The attack on a 
child in a busy department store on a Saturday afternoon will put fear 
and dread into the heart of every parent.

‘If teenagers are not safe from 
paedophile predators in the heart of a busy city, then it is extremely 
worrying.’ Greater Manchester Police have issued CCTV images of the two 
suspects wanted for questioning.

Detective Sergeant Liam Boden said: ‘This young victim has been absolutely devastated by what happened to him.

‘What makes this incident doubly 
shocking is that he was marched across a busy part of the city centre 
during the late afternoon on Saturday.

‘However, this means I am confident that shoppers may have seen the offenders either before or after the incident.

‘I want people to take a good look at the men in these images and tell me who they are.’

His colleague, Superintendent Stuart 
Ellison, said: ‘When you think about a 14-year-old out in the city 
centre at that time of the evening, when the footfall is pretty heavy 
and there are a lot of people about, the fact that someone could be 
marched across the street and into a store in this way is pretty 
horrific.’

He added that he found the attack 
‘particularly disturbing’, saying: ‘When I think about family or friends
 who could have been out in the Arndale at that time of night, it 
disturbs me greatly.’

The assault happened ten weeks ago – 
at 5.45pm on Saturday, June 2 – in the heart of Manchester. The teenager
 reported the incident and was taken to a rape crisis centre at St 
Mary’s Hospital where he was checked by doctors.

A team of officers has been working 
with the traumatised victim to build up a picture of what happened and 
to obtain forensic evidence.

A spokesman for Debenhams said senior staff at the Manchester store were looking into the matter.
