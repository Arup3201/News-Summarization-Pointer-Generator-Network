Children who are better readers or given educational games suffer less from Alzheimer's and other age-related memory loss, say researchers.

A child intellectually stimulated throughout their life has better cognitive abilities in old age.

The University of California study is the first to link childhood experiences to how they will be afflicted in later life.

It found a child's socioeconomic status and literacy may have greater influence on the risk of cognitive impairment late in life than demographic factors such as race.

Professor of neurology Bruce Reed, the director of the Davis Alzheimer's Disease Centre said: 'Declining cognitive function in older adults is a major personal and public health concern.

'But not all people lose cognitive function, and understanding the remarkable variability in cognitive trajectories as people age is of critical importance for prevention, treatment and planning to promote successful cognitive ageing and minimise problems associated with cognitive decline.'

The study published online in Neuropsychology looked at 300 Caucasian, African-American or Hispanic men and women aged cover 60 with no major psychiatric illnesses or life threatening medical conditions.

Results found non-Latino Caucasians scored 20 to 25 per cent higher on tests of semantic memory - general knowledge - and 13 to 15 per cent higher on tests of executive functioning compared to the other ethnic groups.

However, ethnic differences in executive functioning disappeared and differences in semantic memory were reduced by 20 to 30 per cent when group differences in childhood socio-economic status, adult literacy and extent of physical activity during adulthood were considered.

Professor of neurology Dan Mungas said: 'This study is unusual in that it examines how many different life experiences affect cognitive decline in late life.

'It shows that variables like ethnicity and years of education that influence cognitive test scores in a single evaluation are not associated with rate of cognitive decline, but that specific life experiences like level of reading attainment and intellectually stimulating activities are predictive of the rate of late-life cognitive decline.

'This suggests that intellectual stimulation throughout the life span can reduce cognitive decline in old age.'

The results found regardless of race, advanced age and apolipoprotein-E (APOE genotype) were associated with increased cognitive decline over an average of four years that participants were followed.

If worried, people can now use the Early Alert Alzheimer's Home screening test.

APOE is the largest known genetic risk factor for late-onset Alzheimer's.

Yet less decline was experienced by people who reported more engagement in recreational activities in late life and who maintained their levels of activity engagement from middle age to old age.

These findings suggested that early life experiences affect late-life cognition indirectly, through literacy and late-life recreational pursuits.

Doctoral student Paul Brewster added: 'These findings are important because it challenges earlier research that suggests associations between race and ethnicity, particularly among Latinos, and an increased risk of late-life cognitive impairment and dementia.

'Our findings suggest that the influences of demographic factors on late-life cognition may be reflective of broader socioeconomic factors, such as educational opportunity and related differences in physical and mental activity across the life span.'
