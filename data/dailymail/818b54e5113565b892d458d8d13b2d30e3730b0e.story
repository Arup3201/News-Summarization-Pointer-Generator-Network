An own goal is one of the humiliating blunders in sport.

While it’s plausible that soccer players will occasionally fumble the ball into their own net, the prospect of a rugby player adding to his opposition’s scoreboard is much harder to digest.

But that’s exactly what happened on Thursday night at the Rugby Championship clash between Sydney Stars and North Harbour Rays at Leichhardt Oval.

Sam Grasso of Queensland Country is tackled a National Rugby Championship match with the North Harbour Rays, who have since scored Rugby's first own try

The Stars were advancing towards the try line, when Rays forward Mitch Lewis stole the ball and planted it back for a team mate to take.

Mitch Lewis was visibly bewildered at the shock decision to award hi bid to clear the ball as an own try

Referee Ian Smith was unable to see over the mass of bodies and referred to the Television Match Official to settle the dispute.

In a bizarre decision, Smith awarded it as an own try for Lewis, who was left bewildered, staring open mouthed towards the referee.

Fans have taken to social media to express their shock at the controversial decision.

Brett McKay wrote: 'How on earth is that a try?'

Judge Rugby posted: 'I am still in shock at that TMO call'

Sky Sports Rugby: 'Pigs might fly... Rugby's first 'own try'!'

Some users suggested that Smith had mistaken Lewis for a member of the other team, likely a reference to the identical shade of yellow worn on both teams kits.

Jack Somerton raised a worthy query in response to the decision:

'Question, in the stats, who will they award that try to? The guy on the other team?'

The Stars ended up taking their first victory of the season, finishing up 49-40 victors.

 

Twitter was flooded with responses to the shock decision of referee Ian Smith to award the first own try in the history of Rugby Union
