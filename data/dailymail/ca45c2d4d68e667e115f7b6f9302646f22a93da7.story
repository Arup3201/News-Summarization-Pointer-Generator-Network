There’s a new buzz to beauty gadgets in 2015. This year, the key to glowing skin, shiny teeth and silky smooth legs lies with the latest vibrating technology.

Vibrating gadgets can be used to remove hair more easily, increase blood flow to ease aches and pains and can even reduce the look of wrinkles.

Alice Smellie tried out a selection and asked cosmetic expert Dr Hilary Allan at Woodford Medical to give her opinion.

Polishing teeth

Aldi dental polisher, £9.99, Aldi (from January 11)

THE VIBE: A home dental hygiene product for cleaning teeth, eliminating plaque and removing stains in seconds.

THE TEST: Although I loathe going to the dentist, I love the fresh feeling in your mouth as you leave with squeaky-clean teeth. The device looks like a small drill but with a little silicone cup at the end which I fill with my normal toothpaste. The vibration is surprisingly forceful and I struggle to hold the polisher against my teeth. An unattractive line of dribble trickles down my chin as I run it along my front top teeth for about a minute as instructed and then inspect them in the mirror. They feel very clean and look shiny. I’m impressed.

THE EXPERT: The vibrations agitate bits of calcium deposit, not plaque, which form on the teeth, so they come off and teeth are polished smooth. There have been studies done into the use of such machines in dogs with problem teeth and results have been excellent. 9/10

Deep skin-cleansing

Foreo Luna Mini, £99, lookfantastic.com

THE VIBE: The first T-sonic facial-cleansing brush, for a deep and gentle clean in just one minute.

THE TEST: This device uses something called T-sonic technology that generates up to 8,000 pulsations per minute. The Foreo Luna is about the size of a jam jar lid and the thickness of a large roll of Sellotape.

I clean my face then wet the Luna, running it over my dry cheeks, forehead and nose. The rapid vibration is gloriously soothing. But beyond looking slightly flushed, I still don’t get the vibrating cleanser thing — I can achieve the same effect with an exfoliator.

THE EXPERT: Really, it’s facial cleansing for lazy people. If you must invest in one of these cleansers, this might be a good choice as it’s easy to clean. 7/10

Massaging feet

BFF Mini Foot Massager, £9.99, jmldirect.com

THE VIBE: Press down to activate the soothing vibrations while six massaging rollers knead aches and pains away.

THE TEST: After a morning of cleaning the house, I had aching feet and unpacked this surprisingly elegant-looking item with enthusiasm. I placed my feet one at a time on the rollers and pressed down gently.

The entire machine vibrates, but you have to create your own deep tissue massage sensation by running your foot up and down the rollers. I’m a fan of hugely painful reflexology where the feet literally crackle, so I would have enjoyed more pressure. I wouldn’t say my feet felt completely refreshed, but they were certainly much better.

THE EXPERT: This is great. Blood circulation will be increased to the feet, and therefore more oxygen and nutrients brought to the area, and if you’ve been on your feet all day, massaging the muscles and tendons on the sole of the foot will alleviate tension and tightness. 6/10

Exfoliation

Elle Macpherson wet and dry face and body brush from Homedics, £39.99, lookfantastic.com

THE VIBE: All-over deep-cleansing and exfoliation.

THE TEST: This comes with four detachable heads for the separate functions: a dry brush for exfoliating the body, a pumice stone to remove dry skin on the feet, a loofah for gentle exfoliation in the shower and a facial cleansing brush.

It’s winter and my feet are as dry as withered husks. The rotating pumice stone sloughs off the dead skin rapidly and painlessly, which is highly satisfying. I take the loofah into the shower and administer a top to toe rubdown, after which my skin feels softer. My favourite attachment is the dry brush, which is slightly abrasive on my dry thighs, but leaves them tingling and looking smoother. The facial cleansing brush is also invigorating.

THE EXPERT: We know that such beauty tricks as dry brushing for circulation and skin tone, and pumice to exfoliate dry skin are effective. Here, it’s taking the effort away by rotating and vibrating against the skin. 7/10

Applying foundation

Skinpep auto make-up multi-functional auto-puff, £29.99, skinpep.co.uk

THE VIBE: The vibrating anti-bacterial puff provides smooth application with no lumps. Expertly blends liquid or powder foundation for professional results.

THE TEST: This sounded like a ridiculous gimmick. I never have ‘lumps’ in my foundation. But then I have a think and realise that I don’t blend make-up very well around the edges of my face.

Further reflection (and a quick chat with my husband) leads to the conclusion that I often look ‘blotchy’.

I dab a little foundation onto the pad provided and turn the gadget on. I move it over my nose, across my forehead and then (as though I’m a painting by numbers colouring book) fill in the rest of my face. The gentle vibration feels soft. Incredibly, and I mean this, because I was quite prepared to be very rude — the finished look is dewy and even.

THE EXPERT: If you look at skin microscopically, the surface is irregular, with lots of dead skin cells, and the incredibly fast vibrations of this gadget — 1,000-a-minute — will push foundation down and create a smooth surface. 9/10

Quick fix facial anti-ageing

Crystal Clear Lift Away The Years (includes serum), £59.99, crystalclear.co.uk

THE VIBE: The combination of gentle vibrations coupled with intensely effective serum produces outstanding anti-ageing results after just two minutes.

THE TEST: The serum is fresh and lemon-scented. The gadget looks like a felt pen. At the top is a little roller ball, which I unscrew and tip a little serum inside the lid.

As you press the on button, this top bit starts to vibrate gently and I run the smooth, cold roller ball around my face. There is a technique to the lifting: first I work from the base of the neck towards my jawline in small circular movements. Next, I go from jawline to nose, then from cheeks towards ears and finally the forehead. My skin looks plumped up and fresh for a few hours and I’m sure daily use would produce more benefits.

THE EXPERT: This is quite expensive. The oscillating head will improve blood flow to the skin, which brings vital nutrients and oxygen as well as removing toxins from the area, but I’m not sure it will make anyone look younger. 7/10

Hair removal

Gillette Fusion ProGlide Power, £6.99, boots.com

THE VIBE: The blades glide effortlessly through hair with less pull and tug.

THE TEST: I ask my husband to try this new electric razor, which looks like any standard razor but has a slightly bulkier handle because of the button at the front which causes the blade to vibrate.

Mr Smellie has used the same razor since I have met him and is averse to change, but emerges from the shower reluctantly impressed the vibrations apparently create a good, close shave.

I give it a go and the vibrating blade runs smoothly over my legs, whizzing off the stubble of hair which has accumulated in the week since I last shaved.

The results are quite incredible and my legs and armpits are as smooth as a grape. It takes the same time as usual and is totally painless.

THE EXPERT: Vibration supposedly makes hair stand up on end so that you can get a closer shave — which makes a great deal of sense. 8/10

Full body massage

Scholl Comfort Shiatsu Massager, £112, amazon.co.uk

THE VIBE: Infrared heat helps to loosen tense muscles while the vibrating, two-level seat helps to relax tired legs.

THE TEST: This is like a giant child’s car seat, which can be attached to an ordinary chair with strong Velcro strips.

When turned on the seat vibrates, nodules roll up and down the spine and red light warms your back. Close your eyes and you could almost be in a tropical location, being pummelled by an expert.

The pressure of the massage is firm, and feels like strong fingers, the heat from the infrared is deliciously warm on sore muscles, and the vibration of the seat invigorating.

Probably not for all ages, but various members of my family (aged four to 91) tried it out and had to be forced off.

THE EXPERT: Here, the heat will be improving blood flow to the muscles and therefore alleviating tension and pain.

Combined with the deep massage and vibrating seat you are getting a triple whammy of relief. 10/10
