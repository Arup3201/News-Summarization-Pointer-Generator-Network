The world's largest coffee chain, Starbucks, and the country's biggest donut company, Dunkin Donuts, are ramping up efforts to compete with bars and restaurants by expanding their evening and light bite choices to 'thousands of stores'.

Desperate to attract customers after the morning rush is over, both chains are frantically adding to their menus in the hope that people will see them as an option for lunch and even dinner. 

Starbucks first offered beer and wine after 4 p.m. at one of its Seattle cafes in 2010 and the Starbucks Evenings concept is now available in 32 cafes in seven markets around the country.  

Not just for coffee anymore: Starbucks is ramping up efforts to compete with bars and restaurants by expanding its evening alcohol and light bites to 'thousands of select stores' over the next several years

For my first course: The Starbucks Evenings concept is currently available in 32 cafes, with plans to reach 40 by the end of the year

The cafes also serve a variety of small dishes ranging in price from $3 to $5, such as bacon-wrapped dates, truffle macaroni and cheese, and flatbreads. 

In an attempt to keep the sales and profits flowing nearly around the clock, Dunkin Donuts is also planning to sell more dinner-friendly foods in 2015.

'Though breakfast remains our core, today people are seeking all-day dining, and they want to eat what they want, when they want it and where they want it - that's why we are so committed to menu innovation and giving our guests even more options that they can enjoy any time of day,' John Costello, Dunkin Donuts president, global marketing and innovation, said in an interview with TheStreet.

Dunkin Donuts introduced steak this fall to make a steak sandwich and a wrap with eggs.

Only 40% of Dunkin's sales come after 11 am, leaving a lot of room for growth. 

Coffee to stay? Dunkin Donuts has already begun to introduce a dinner staple -- steak -- this fall, recently making a steak sandwich and a wrap with eggs permanent additions to its menu

Not just for donuts anymore: With hardier menu items typically reserved for dinner, sales could grow at the more than 2,300 Dunkin Donuts in the U.S. that are open 24 hours

The concept is a common one in the restaurant industry - figuring out ways to maximize sales throughout the day, since stores have to pay for rent and labor anyway.

Dunkin Donuts may draw inspiration for dinner from overseas. 'We have a variety of products and flavors that are tailored to the regional preferences of our guests around the world such as donuts stuffed, topped and glazed with everything from rice pudding to saffron to crushed pistachios in India,' Costello said 

As for Starbucks, the chain recently introduced new sandwiches and salads to boost sales in the afternoon. 

Starbucks now offers 10 standard small plate options as part of its evening menu, such as truffle macaroni and cheese and double chocolate brownie bites.

There are also five choices of red wine, three white wines, a sparkling rose and proseco. 

The expansion of Starbucks Evenings is similar to that of Dunkin's. The company wants to boost sales after the morning rush hour when people are getting their caffeine fix. 

During a shareholder update last week it was noted that the company's growth in food sales 'indicates that Starbucks is increasingly recognized by our customers as an attractive option for lunch.'

Take your pick: As well as beer and wine, the cafes also serve a variety of small dishes ranging in price from $3 to $5, such as bacon-wrapped dates, truffle macaroni and cheese, and flatbreads

Starbucks also branching out into other areas to as it faces more competition in the coffee market.

The company, which announced a long-term plan to almost double its market value to $100 billion yesterday, also is expanding and improving its rewards program and mobile applications.

Last spring, Starbucks said it would soon test a way for customers to order items ahead of time with their smartphones.

The company also recently purchased a chain of tea shops called Teavana. 

CEO Howard Schultz has said he wants to make tea as popular in the U.S. as he's helped make coffee.
