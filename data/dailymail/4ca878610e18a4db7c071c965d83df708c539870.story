The bride wore white;
the groom wore shackles.

The marriage of Danne Desbrow and his fiancee, Destiny, came
just minutes after he was sentenced to 53 years-to-life in prison for
first-degree murder, U-T San Diego reported on Monday.

San Diego Superior Court Judge Patricia Cookson officiated
at both events. She even baked a cake for the Sept. 17 ceremony, the newspaper
said.

Cookson declined to respond to a request for comment from
the newspaper.

Desbrow was sentenced for the 2003 killing of Kevin Santos
after a witness with key information came forward recently. His defense
attorney argued Desbrow was defending himself in a fight.

During the two-month trial, Desbrow proposed to his
girlfriend. The two met in high school but lost contact after she became
pregnant at 16, according to the U-T.

They reunited in January after the mother tracked down
Desbrow so their son could meet his father. Desbrow was in jail at the time
awaiting trial.

After Desbrow proposed, Cookson agreed to marry them,
according to the U-T.

Cookson sentenced Desbrow to two consecutive 25-year-to-life
terms and an additional three years for threatening a witness.

After the sentencing, members of the victim's family were
escorted out of the courtroom, the newspaper said. The couple's relatives were
allowed to remain. The deputies locked the doors and Cookson married the
couple.

The couple kissed and Cookson went back to her chambers.
Moments later, she appeared with two pieces of vanilla Bundt cake on paper
plates with plastic forks.

According to UT San Diego, one witness said Cookson did not bring out the whole cake because she was leery of bringing the knife that would be used to slice pieces into the courtroom with Desbrow nearby.

The couple sat at a table in the well of the courtroom where lawyers usually sit. Destiny only had one bite of cake. Her husband finished his.

'That is something that does not happen with great regularity,' said Jan Caldwell, a spokesman for Sheriff Bill Gore, who oversees the county jail system. 'Iâ€™ve never heard of it.'

However, weddings are not uncommon in jails during regular visiting hours. Couples exchange vows through the glass that separates visitors from inmates.

Danne and Destiny Desbrow get married with Judge Patricia Cookson presiding.

Destiny Desbrow told the newspaper the judge baked it
herself.

Danne Desbrow intends to appeal the murder conviction. He
remains in county jail pending another court hearing on a separate case in
October.

'Obviously, it was an unusual day from start to
finish,' defense attorney Steve Cline told the U-T. 'I mean, I
appreciate that she honored the request for them to marry. But, I've never seen
anything like that.'
