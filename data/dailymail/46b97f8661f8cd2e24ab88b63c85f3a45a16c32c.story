Hundreds of fighters from the Russian republic of Chechnya have formed their own 'Death Battalion' to join the insurgency in east Ukraine.

The 300 or so volunteers say they are mostly former state security troops in the mainly Muslim region, where Moscow has fought two bloody wars since the fall of the Soviet Union.

Reuters reported seeing dozens of the armed men in camouflage uniforms chanting 'Allahu Akbar' as they trained in the snow in their camp outside Donetsk, east Ukraine.

Well drilled: The fighters hold their weapons in formation at their training camp just outside Donetsk

Seasoned Chechen fighters, whose combat experience often dates back to the 1994-96 and 1999-2000 wars, fight on both sides in Ukraine, adding to the complexity of a conflict taking on the character of a Cold War proxy war.

The West says regular Russian troops are involved in the fighting, while Russia accuses Europe and the U.S. of engineering a coup in Kiev and supporting its new pro-West regime.

'This is volunteer battalion Death,' said the deputy commander of the group, who only gave his nickname 'Stinger'.

He spoke to Reuters at a former tourist camp outside the rebel stronghold of Donetsk, east Ukraine, which he and his men have turned into their base.

'There are about three hundred of us in Donetsk region. We have battlefield experience from 10 to 20 years starting from 1995,' said the man, in his forties, a pistol fixed to his thigh.

He had a little Chechen flag in green, white and red stitched to his cap and spoke Russian with a strong Caucasus accent. Several cars with Chechen registration plates were parked in the camp.

Russia sides with east Ukraine's rebels but denies sending troops to reinforce them. Some fighters on the ground admit to being former Russian servicemen, or 'on leave'. Moscow says any Russians fighting there are volunteers.

Chechnya's own separatist insurgency, in which the republic sought independence from the Russian Federation, was eventually squashed after two bloody wars, but unrest still simmers among Caucasian Islamist groups.

Gunmen attacked a police post and captured a building in the regional capital of Grozny last week and at least 20 people, including ten police and ten suspected militants, were killed in gunbattles that ensued.

Violence erupted hours before Russian President Vladimir Putin had been due to give a major speech in Moscow, a symbolic challenge to the man credited for the Russia's victory in the second Chechen war.

Re-establishing Moscow's control over Chechnya and then introducing an uneasy peace under Ramzan Kadyrov, whom critics and rights campaigners accuse of heavy-handed tactics and human rights violations, is seen by Mr Putin's supporters as a key achievement.

Physical training: The men jog along the snow-covered roads of the war-torn region 

Phew... But by this point they seem to have slowed slightly to rather less than a jog... 

Lots to work on: The formation appears to break up as the faster fighters speed off around the corner

In Ukraine, Stinger's men are sworn enemies with another group of Chechens who fight on the opposite side of the conflict and support the Kiev government troops. 

Some of them have Western passports after fleeing Russia following the two wars. They say Moscow is theirs and Kiev's joint enemy and that Chechnya is occupied by Russia.

Stinger, however, said Chechnya was being destroyed in the wars of 1990s and became peaceful again only when some local leaders allied with the Kremlin.

Some of those in the 'Death' unit said they had initially fought against Russia in Chechnya but later switched sides and were amnestied by a former Kremlin-allied head of the region, Ramzan's father, Akhmet Kadyrov.

'Now we are (former) soldiers and officers of the Russian army, of Russian special forces, mostly veterans of war campaigns,' Stinger said.
