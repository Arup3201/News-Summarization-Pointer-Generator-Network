Valued at £4million, he became MK Dons' youngest debutant at just 15 in 2011.

Zimbabwe-born Galloway featured 13 times for Karl Robinson's side last term, scoring one goal, but his campaign ended on a sour note when he was sent-off for two booking against Rotherham in April.

However, Premier League side Everton have not been put off and are considering a move for the highly-rated 18-year-old.
