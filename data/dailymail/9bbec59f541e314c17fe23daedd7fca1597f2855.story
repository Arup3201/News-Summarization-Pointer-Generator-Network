French security services have allegedly identified another suspected accomplice of Amedy Coulibaly, who kidnapped and killed four people in a kosher deli in Paris on Friday.

According to Le Parisien, police sources are investigating a man from a Paris suburb, who may have driven Coulibaly to the supermarket.

French police revealed that Coulibaly, 32, rented a small suburban house in Gentilly the week before the hostage situation - and filled it with an impressive arsenal of weapons. 

The police refused to disclose what they discovered inside, but detectives from the Paris Criminal Brigade and a special anti-terrorism unit reportedly seized a scooter there. 

This allowed them to identity another man who they believe acted as Coulibaly's accomplice.

He has not been identified by name, but the newspaper claims he may have shot and wounded a jogger in nearby Fontenay-aux-Roses on January 7, the same day the Kouachi brothers killed 12 people in the Charlie Hebdo attack.

Le Monde reported that the runner, who was shot on the back of the leg at around 8.30pm local time, fled to his neighbours for help while the gunman escaped.

The incident was initially being investigated by a prosecutor in Nanterre, but it has since been elevated to an anti-terrorism unit in Paris.

Investigators are also following a money trail because they do not believe Coulibaly and the Kouachi brothers had the means to  bankroll their activities without help.

Christophe Crepin, a spokesman for the French Police Union, said: 'Not only was there the cost of weapons, ammunition and equipment to cover, but also money needed to rent suspected hideouts like the one in Gentilly and to pay their living expenses.

'We're dealing with a well-organized mafia-like structure.'

Coulibaly killed the son of a chief Rabbi, a teacher, a pensioner and a shop worker saving for his marriage at the Hyper Cacher in Vincennes.

Police are still searching for Coulibaly's partner, Hayat Boumeddiene, who fled to Syria before a wave of terror attacks in Paris - in which 17 innocent people died. 

A police source said she flew to Turkey via Madrid on January 2 - despite alleged sightings of her in Paris on Thursday.

Authorities in Istanbul then reported seeing a woman matching her description cross the Turkey- Syria border on Thursday, the day her husband killed policewoman Clarissa Jean-Phillipe.

Sources say she had a return ticket from Istanbul to Madrid for yesterday but failed to show for the flight.

Earlier today, MailOnline revealed exclusive footage from inside the kosher deli in Paris, where the fanatical gunman  murdered four shoppers, before being killed by armed police.

CCTV video from inside the Hyper Cacher store shows bodies on the floor, while a child's pushchair sits empty in one of the aisles - littered with abandoned shopping.

Fear: Hostages inside the Hyper Cacher mart huddle together near the checkouts after watching four of their fellow shoppers murdered in cold blood

Murdered: two bodies are pictured on the floor of the market. The one closest to the camera is believed to be Yohan Cohen who was shot after he grabbed one of Coulibaly's guns, only to find it had jammed

Coulibaly can be seen in the back of the shop wearing a bullet proof vest, while a shop assistant stands against the opposite wall with his hands up.

A time-stamp at the bottom of the image shows the time as 1.40pm, almost exactly four hours before firearms officers cut Coulibaly down in a hail of 40 bullets at 5.21pm local time.

One of the bodies, pictured next to a checkout, is believed to be that of Yohan Cohen, the 22-year old shop worker who grabbed one of Coulibaly's rifles after the terrorist placed it down.

According to witness accounts Mr Cohen picked up the gun and attempted to turn it on Coulibaly only to find it had jammed. The terrorist then shot him in cold blood and he died on the spot.
