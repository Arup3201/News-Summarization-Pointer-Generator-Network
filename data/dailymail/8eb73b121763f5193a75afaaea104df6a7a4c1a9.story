Seen this before? Many have been annoyed by the amount of nuisance texts promising payment protection insurance refunds

A marketing company that sent millions of illegal texts encouraging Britons to claim compensation for PPI or accidents has become the first to be fined.

The Information Commissioner’s Office has ordered the owners of Tetrus Telecoms to pay £440,000 after they plagued the public with up to 900,000 unlawful spam texts per day over three years.

Owners Christopher Niebel and Gary McNeish were making up to £7,000 a day from selling the details of those who replied to other companies.

Other firms sending similar texts or phone messages have been warned they may be next as the ICO is receiving tens of thousands of complaints from the public.

Information Commissioner, Christopher Graham, said: 'The public have 
told us that they are distressed and annoyed by the constant bombardment
of illegal texts and calls and we are currently cracking down on the 
companies responsible, using the full force of the law.

'The two individuals we have served penalties on today made a 
substantial profit from the sale of personal information. They knew they
were breaking the law.

'Our message to the public is that if you don’t know who sent you a text
message then do not respond, otherwise your details may be used to 
generate profits for these unscrupulous individuals.'

Examples of the text messages sent out by Tetrus Telecoms included: 'CLAIM TODAY you may be entitled to £3500 for the accident you had. To 
claim free, reply CLAIM to this message. To opt out text STOP. Thank 
you'.

Another was: 'URGENT! If you took out a Bank Loan prior to 2007 then you
are almost certainly entitled to £2300 in compensation. To claim reply 
‘YES’.'

The monster fine came following an 18-month investigation into the activities of Tetrus Telecoms.

Money-maker: These companies bombard people with texts and those who reply they then try to extract personal information that can help them make huge profits

The company was sending huge volumes of unsolicited text messages from offices in Stockport and Birmingham, without the consent of the recipient and without identifying the sender - both of which are legal requirements.

Any replies were then used to generate leads that were sold to other companies at a considerable profit.

The ICO’s investigation included raids at the company’s Stockport premises, in August 2011, and the Manchester home of Niebel, in February this year.

Phone owners should also not receive unwanted automated calls - but many companies flout the law and ring them anyway - much to the anger of many

The evidence obtained showed Tetrus was using unregistered pay as you go sim cards to send out as many as 840,000 illegal text messages a day with an income of £7,000 - £8,000 a day.

Niebel has now been ordered to pay a penalty of £300,000, while McNeish, who appears to have taken less out of the business, has been fined £140,000.

The ICO has connected the company to over 400 complaints to its office about spam texts linked to Tetrus.

If you receive a text from a company
you know, or from an anonymous five digit short code, you can prevent 
any repeat by replying with the word 'STOP'.

If the text message is from an 
unknown company, or from an organisation you are not familiar with, the 
telecoms watchdog OFCOM recommends that you do not reply.

Responding will confirm that the number is active and might result in more messages, or even voice calls.

Instead, you should report the text 
to your network operator, which may be able to prevent further messages 
from the originating number.

If the texts continue, complain to 
the Information Commissioner's Office – 
http://www.ico.gov.uk/complaints.aspx or 0303 123 1113.

To stop unwanted sales calls, 
register your phone number – either landline or mobile – with the 
Telephone Preference Service on its website  http://www.tpsonline.org.uk
or 0845 070 0707.

This service is free and takes some 28 days for the ban to come into effect.

Alternatively, some telephone 
companies offer services to block unwanted calls. For example, BT offers
'Privacy at Home', 'Choose to Refuse' and 'Anonymous Call Rejection'.
