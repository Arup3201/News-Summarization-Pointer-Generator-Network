Stupid and insensitive: Democrat Brian Schweitzer issued a humble apology for his 'stupid and insensitive remarks'

The former governor of Montana has been forced into a grovelling apology after saying House Majority Leader Eric Cantor sets off his 'gaydar' and likening the U.S. Intelligence Committee chairwoman to a prostitute.

Brian Schweitzer sparked outrage over comments he made this week in a newspaper interview in which he speculated over Cantor's sexuality and railed against fellow Democrat Sen. Dianne Feinstein.

But yesterday the Democrat issued a humble apology for his 'stupid and insensitive remarks' after they were published in the National Journal.

'I recently made a number of stupid and insensitive remarks to a reporter from the National Journal,' he wrote on his Facebook page. 'I am deeply sorry and sincerely apologize for my carelessness and disregard.'

Schweitzer shocked colleagues and adversaries alike when he shared his perceptions of Republican Mr Cantor's sexuality following his surprising Virginia GOP loss last week to an unknown candidate.

'If you were just a regular person, you turned on the TV, and you saw Eric Cantor talking, I would say — and I'm fine with gay people, that's all right — but my gaydar is 60-70 percent,' he said. 'But he's not, I think, so I don't know. Again, I couldn't care less. I'm accepting.'

He added: 'Don't hold this against me, but I'm going to blurt it out. How do I say this ... men in the South, they are a little effeminate. They just have effeminate mannerisms.'

Cantor, who represents central Virginia and is outgoing House Majority Leader, has been married to his wife for 25 years and has three children.

'I am deeply sorry': Schweitzer made the humble apology on his Facebook page

Schweitzer made the slur after a similarly ill-advised gaffe in which he compared Sen. Feinstein, the Democratic senator from California who chairs the Intelligence Committee, to a prostitute whle discussing her position on intelligence gathering.

'She was the woman who was standing under the streetlight with her dress pulled all the way up over her knees,' he said. 'And now she says, 'I'm a nun,' when it comes to this spying. I mean, maybe that's the wrong metaphor — but she was all in!'

And yesterday when asked about Schweitzer's comments, Feinstein laughed and said: 'You better keep him away from my husband.'

Media fury: His comments were met with widespread disapproval with Republican National Committee Reince Priebus tweeting this

She then made a hand gesture indicating that Schweitzer’s remarks were not mentally balanced, adding: 'That’s all I’m going to say.'

She then stepped onto the Senate floor.

His comments were met with widespread disapproval.

Republican National Committee Reince Priebus tweeted: 'If a Republican said *anything* about "gaydar" or a senator being a "prostitute," the media fury would never end.'

Republican Mike Coffman added: 'What kind of sexist scumbag says something like this? Diane Feinstein has more class in her pinky than Schweitzer has in his 20 gallon hat.'

Schweitzer has hinted at a desire to compete in the Democrat presidential primaries in 2016, even if Hillary Clinton runs as well.

Asked on MSNBC’s “Morning Joe” program in January about whether he would run for president in 2016, he said, “I haven’t decided that,” before adding, “It would ruin my life.”

But he went on to tell the show's hosts that he would be a successful president, citing his record as governor of Montana.

'As governor, I spent eight years — every single year I was governor we had the largest budget surplus in the history of Montana,' Schweitzer said. 'I cut more taxes than any governor in the history of Montana, invested more new money in education. If a Democrat is good with money, you can’t beat ‘em.'

He added: 'When you’ve got a Democrat like me who is good with money and Republicans have to admit it, they say, "Oh, we don’t want to run against him again"'
