Sportsmail understands Manchester City's director of football Txiki Begiristain was in Porto on Thursday to watch French centre half Eliaquim Mangala in action. Read the full story on the £20m-rated centre back HERE

Manchester City want to buy British this  summer as they struggle to keep hold of their homegrown stars.

The club are identifying summer targets to satisfy Premier League rules on homegrown players, with Southampton full back Luke Shaw, Everton midfielder Ross Barkley and Nottingham Forest defender Jamaal Lascelles in their sights.

City nominated nine homegrown players in their squad at the start of the season but face losing several of them this summer.

VIDEO: Scroll down to watch Roberto Martinez on Ross Barkley's ability

Midfielder: Ross Barkley

Full-back: Luke Shaw

Defender: Jamaal Lascelles

Wonderkid: Ross Barkley (L) has been earning rave reviews for Everton, including this goal against Newcastle

Luke who's talking: Southampton defender Shaw has also been linked with Manchester United and Chelsea

Best defence: Nottingham Forest's Jamaal Lascelles could be needed to replace departing homegrown players

And, although the 2012 Premier League 
champions are closing in on £20m-rated Porto centre back Eliaquim 
Mangala, don't expect too many more exports in the summer.

Central defender Joleon Lescott will leave when his contract expires. Likewise, Micah Richards is not prepared to sign a new, five-year deal.

Richards has struggled for games under Manuel Pellegrini, yet the club are keen to keep him and Sportsmail understands the right back has been offered an increase on his £80,000-a-week deal to stay.

Not about the money: Micah Richards has been offered an increase to stay but wants more playing time

What shall we do? Youngsters Jack Rodwell and Deryck Boyota are also considering their futures

Premier League clubs must include no more than 17 non-homegrown players over the age of 21 in their squads of 25. Homegrown players are defined as players trained by their club, or another in the same country, for at least three years between 15 and 21. There is no obligation to put a certain number of them in a match-day squad.Why were the rules brought in?There was concern that the richest clubs would stockpile the best players to the detriment of developing their own youngsters.

The 25-year-old’s contract does not expire until the end of next  season, but City may look to sell him in a cut-price deal this summer to avoid losing him for nothing in 2015. Liverpool, Arsenal and AC Milan are monitoring the situation.

Dedryck Boyata, who qualifies as homegrown even though he is  Belgian, has also been offered a new deal despite playing only one  league game this season.

However, the defender is understood to be hugely reluctant to  re-sign given his lack of playing time and is also likely to leave.  City chiefs will open talks with James Milner — whose contract expires next season — before the World Cup, but the England  forward wants assurances over his playing time before agreeing to an extension.

Stunted growth: Rodwell has struggled to displace stars like Vincent Kompany since moving from Everton

Pecking order: Alex Nimely may be tempted to move with the likes of Sergio Aguero ahead of him

The future of striker Alex Nimely, 22, is also unclear given that his contract expires this summer, while Jack Rodwell is known to be considering his future at the Etihad Stadium.

Midfielder Gareth Barry, on loan at Everton, will definitely be leaving while Serbia defender Matija  Nastasic will be counted as an overseas player next season, having turned 21 last month.

Behind the scenes, the potential lack of homegrown talent is a  concern and buying British is likely to be a necessity for City.

Sporting director Txiki Begiristain is well aware of the problem and City’s network of scouts are  working hard to identify targets.

Warning signs! Scott Sinclair (L) was offloaded after barely featuring during his short spell at City

However, persuading the likes of Shaw, 18, Barkley, 20, and Lascelles, 20, that they can fulfil their  footballing potential at City might prove a further stumbling block.

You only need look at how some City buys have fared to understand why they might be cautious. Scott Sinclair and Rodwell arrived from Swansea and Everton respectively in 2012 but have struggled to make an impact.

Sinclair has been shipped out on loan to West Bromwich Albion while Rodwell has found first-team  football hard to come by, partly due to injury, and has made only seven Premier League starts.

Head to head: Jose Mourinho (L) and Manuel Pellegrini could be competing for the same players next season

Old guard: John Terry (top), Frank Lampard and Ashley Cole (R) are some of Chelsea's hew homegrown stars

Chelsea are also keeping abreast of the homegrown market. Manager Jose Mourinho could name only a 22-man squad in September after reaching his full quota of 17 overseas players.

At the time, John Terry, Gary Cahill, Ashley Cole, Frank Lampard and Ryan Bertrand were the only homegrown players at his disposal — meaning he had to forego three squad places.

Chelsea, like City, will be in the market for all the best English talent this summer, including Shaw and Barkley.

And that means only one thing: sky-high prices.
