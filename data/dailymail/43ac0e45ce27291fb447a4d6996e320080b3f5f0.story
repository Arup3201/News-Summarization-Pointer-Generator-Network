Sex symbol: Former actress Gina Lollobrigida was once dubbed 'the most beautiful woman in the world' after starring in a film of the same name

An Italian film actress, once dubbed 'the most beautiful woman in the world', has become involved in a bizarre legal battle with her former fiancé claiming he 'married' another woman pretending to be her.

Gina Lollobrigida, 85, was one of the sex symbols of her day with sultry starring roles alongside Frank Sinatra and Humphrey Bogart during the 1950s and 60s.

But she has become entangled in real-life love scandal of her own after allegedly discovering that her ex partner, Spanish businessman Javier Rigau y Rafols, married an imposter in a bid to lay claim to her estate when she dies.

'This vile person married me by 
proxy, without my knowledge and without my permission, in order to 
inherit my estate after my death,' she told the Italian media today.

'There will be international investigations because I want to shed light on this squalid affair and all the people involved.'

Ms Lollobrigida accused Mr Rafols, who is 34 years younger, of being able to carry out the fraud because he had obtained legal powers to act on her behalf.

'A while ago he convinced me to give him
 my power of attorney. He needed it for some legal affairs. But instead I
 fear that he took advantage of the fact that I don't understand 
Spanish...Who knows what he had me sign,' she said.

The fake marriage allegedly took 
place three years ago, but she only found out about it by chance this 
week when she came across legal records on the internet.

'I found a document in which it seems
 that in November 2010 he became my husband, in Barcelona, in front of 
eight witnesses. It is incredible. At the altar there was another woman,
 a certain Teresa,' she said.

A member of her staff, who identified
 himself as Carlo, confirmed to The Daily Telegraph today that she was 
planning to launch legal action against her former toy boy.

'She's very angry. She considers him to be a vulture. A very strange affair,' he said.

The couple met at a party in Monte Carlo in 1984 and had at one point been engaged.

But the marriage was called off in 2006 and the pair split.

It would have been her second wedding, following her 1971 divorce from Yugoslavian-born doctor Milko Skofic.

The former actress has known Spanish businessman Javier Ragau y Rafols for more than 20 years but the pair reportedly split in 2006

Mr Rafols was reported as having said at the time he would 'always love and respect' Ms Lollobrigida.

But on Sunday she made a formal complaint to Carabinieri police in Rome and is threatening legal action.

The former screen idol has since turned her skills towards art in recent years, first in photography and later sculpting.

Lollobrigida began making movies in Italy just after the end of World War II. Her screen credits include 'The World's Most Beautiful Woman,' 'Come September,' 'Trapeze,' 'Bread, Love and Dreams' and 'Never So Few'.
