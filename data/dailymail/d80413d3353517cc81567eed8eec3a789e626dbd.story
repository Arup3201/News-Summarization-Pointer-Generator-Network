A team of cadaver dogs has arrived in Aruba to search for the remains
of Robyn Gardner, the Maryland woman who vanished two months ago while on holiday with a companion.

Solicitor General Taco Stein said that the dogs
arrived from the Netherlands last weekend and will soon begin searching for the body of the 35-year-old.

Mr Stein said the search will 
focus on a southeastern section of the island known as Seroe Colorado.

U.S. businessman Gary Giordano, 50, has been jailed since August 5 
on suspicion of involvement in Miss Gardner's presumed death.

Giordano, the only suspect being questioned in relation to the disappearance, denies any wrongdoing and says 
Miss Gardner was swept away while they were snorkelling off the Dutch 
Caribbean island.

The pair had gone travelling with each other on July 31 after reportedly meeting on swingers website Adult Friend Finder.

Giordano and Miss Gardner were last seen leaving the Rum Reef Bar & Grill restaurant on Baby Beach at about 4pm on August 2.

Two hours later, Giordano is seen alone on security camera, wearing no top but with his toupee still in place.

He reported his companion missing and initially assisted the search but was later detained and arrested at the airport as he tried to flee the country.

After Gardner disappeared, Giordano inquired about claiming a $1.5million insurance policy on her life, which he filed on the day before the trip.

Shocking CCTV footage emerged showing missing Miss Gardner having a violent fight with Giordano hours before her disappearance.

The prime murder suspect is alleged to have threatened to kill his friend while grabbing her by the neck and shoving her into an elevator on the last day Miss Gardner was seen alive.

Prosecutors need more evidence to charge him, but witnesses have come forward to claim he was sweating profusely on that August 2 day, with blood next to him on the beach and a large scratch mark on his throat.

His father, Frank Giordano has said his son is a 'not a monster' but a 'good human being, who is good to his family'.

Gardner's boyfriend Richard Forester, 40, said the couple had a row before she left for Aruba.

Giordano is said to have read a text on Miss Gardner's phone, in which she wrote to her boyfriend back home: 'I love you. I care about you. We'll sort this out when I get back.'
