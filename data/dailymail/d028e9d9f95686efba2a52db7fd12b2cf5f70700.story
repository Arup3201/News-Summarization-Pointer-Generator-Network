Britain's decision to name a part of Antarctica after the Queen has been met with fury in Argentina.

An unnamed official in Buenos Aries said calling the vast disputed territory – twice the size of the UK – Queen Elizabeth Land is a ‘systematic attack within the context of the fight over the Falkland Islands’.

The name was announced by Foreign Secretary William Hague to mark the Diamond Jubilee.

Honour: Part of British Antarctica has been renamed Queen Elizabeth Land to mark the Jubilee

One Argentine newspaper called it a 
‘provocation’ as the row over the Falklands continues to simmer. 
Argentina is expected to file a formal complaint.

Britain’s claim on the icy, 
uninhabited land dates back to 1908 and is maintained via three British 
Antarctic Survey research stations.

New Zealand, France, Norway, Australia, Chile and Argentina have also lodged claims but most countries do not recognise them.

The
Foreign Office announced on Tuesday that a 169,000 square mile part of 
British Antarctic Territory had been named in the Queen's honour.

Experts said the move by 
the British Government to mark the Jubilee year was 'provocative' and 
designed to strengthen British interests in the area.

Klaus
Dodds, professor of geopolitics at Royal Holloway, University of 
London, told The Telegraph it was 'a calculated move to reinforce UK 
interests' in the area.

He 
told the newspaper: 'I think it’s provocative and it’s significant 
because place-naming is one of the most powerful ways of reinforcing 
your sense of ownership of a territory, and the use of royalty is, in 
turn, the most powerful way of cementing a connection with the UK.'

It is the latest in a ratcheting up of tensions between the two 
countries that has coincided with the 30th anniversary of the Falklands 
War.

Earlier this year, Falkland residents announced plans for
a referendum in 2013 in an attempt to fend off Argentinian claims to 
the territory.

The 
naming was announced following the Queen's 
visit to the Foreign and Commonwealth Office and an earlier sit in on 
Cabinet.

He told 
assembled staff: 'As a mark of this country's gratitude to the Queen for
her service, we are naming a part of the British Antarctic Territory in
her honour as Queen Elizabeth Land.

'This is a fitting tribute 
at the end of Her Majesty's Diamond Jubilee year, and I am very proud to
be able to announce it as she visits the Foreign and Commonwealth 
Office.

'The British Antarctic Territory is a unique and 
important member of the network of fourteen UK Overseas Territories. To 
be able to recognise the UK's commitment to Antarctica with a permanent 
association with Her Majesty is a great honour.'

He added the piece of land was previously unnamed.

Queen
Elizabeth Land is a barren, landlocked ice and snow-covered area 
uninhabited by people and virtually devoid of animal life.

It
is ice-cream cone shaped with its tip close to the South Pole and it 
lies a few hundred miles from the coast where seals, emperor penguins 
and birdlife such as albatrosses are found.

The Queen has been on the throne for 60 of the 104 years since the UK claimed territory in Antarctica in 1908.

A
spokeswoman for the British Antarctic Survey, responsible for the UK's 
scientific activities on the continent, said: 'It's very high altitude 
so would be a great deal colder than the coast so you wouldn't get 
penguins, it's very mountainous and cold.

'At
the moment it's the summer season there which runs from October to 
March so it would be minus 10C inland and minus 25C at the South Pole.

'In the winter time it can get to minus 40C and minus 50C but most of the life is found around the coastline.'

Earlier, the Queen visited Downing Street where she attended a Cabinet meeting for the first time.

Earlier in the day the Queen met Cabinet - becoming the first peace-time monarch to do so for 231 years.

She spoke only twice during the visit, once to suggest
that the Queen’s Speech should be shorter rather than longer, and again
to wish ministers a merry Christmas.

The Queen was also presented with a 
gift from her Cabinet – a set of 60 place mats, one for each year of her
reign, each bearing an image from Buckingham Palace.
