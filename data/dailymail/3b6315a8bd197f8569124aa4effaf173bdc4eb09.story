Former IRA commander Martin McGuinness has described the death of two boys killed by one of the terror group's bombs as 'shameful' during a peace lecture in the town where it happened.

Three-year-old Johnathan Ball and 12-year-old Tim Parry were both killed by bombs planted by the IRA in Warrington on March 20, 1993.

Mr McGuinness yesterday visited the town after being invited by Tim Parry's father to speak at a peace foundation named in his son's memory.

A small band of around 12 demonstrators 
stood outside the venue last night protesting at Mr McGuinness' speech 
at the Tim Parry - Johnathan Ball Foundation for Peace.

Julie Hambleton, whose sister Maxine, 
18, was killed in the Birmingham pub bombings, compared Mr McGuinness' 
giving a talk on peace to 'asking Myra Hindley to give a talk on child 
protection'.

Before the speech, Mr McGuinness said that he 'understood' the objections and described the path to peace as a 'journey'.

'My heart goes out to them because they 
too are people that have suffered as a result of the conflict in the 
north of Ireland,' he said.

'I fully appreciate that there are other people who don't feel able to make that journey. I would be the last to criticise them.

'My heart goes out to all the victims of the conflict. I feel very compassionate to all of them.

'We need to be sorry for everything that happened with the people involved in the conflict.'

Martin McGuinness has gone from former IRA second in command to mainstream politician who shook hands with the Queen.

Born in 1950, he joined the Provisional IRA as a teenager and quickly rose up the ranks.

By 1971, aged 21, he was second in command of the IRA in Derry.

He held that position at the time of Bloody Sunday, when 14 civil rights protesters were killed by British paratroopers in the city.

During the Saville Inquiry into the events of that day, Paddy Ward claimed McGuinness had personally handed him bomb parts, an allegation McGuinness claimed was 'fantasy'.

In 1973, he was convicted by Ireland's Special Criminal Court, after being caught with a car  loaded with explosives and ammunition. He refused to recognise the court, and was sentenced to six months imprisonment.

He has also been accused of attending the interrogation of British government informer Frank Hegarty, whom he allegedly encouraged to return to Derry where he was murdered. He has always denied those allegations.

However, he has never denied his role in the IRA, and has said: ‘I didn’t say I never fired a gun – I was in the IRA. There were battles on the streets of Derry.'

However, when asked if he had killed anyone, he answered no.

He claims he left the Provisionals in 1974 to pursue a career in politics.

As a member of Sinn Fein, he was elected to Parliament at Westminster in 1997 - although he never took up his seat.

He was the political party's chief negotiator when the Good Friday Agreement was signed in 1998 and was later Education Minister after the Northern Ireland Assembly was set-up.

Since 2007 he has been the deputy first minister.

In 2012, he shook hands with the Queen almost 33 years after her cousin, Lord Mountbatten of Burma, was murdered by an IRA bomb.

The gesture of mutual acceptance and acknowledgement was an astonishing act of forgiveness by the 86-year-old monarch who adored her ‘Uncle Dickie’.

During his speech, McGuinness told of his own and Ulster's journey to peace and his hopes for the future, adding: 'I was once in the IRA. I am now a peace builder. It has been a journey which has involved much hurt and pain.

'I have followed many coffins and stood beside many grieving families in the years since.

'But there can be no greater tragedy in life than parents having to bury their child.'

He added: 'Regrettably the past cannot be changed or undone. Neither can the suffering, the hurt or the violence of the conflict be disowned by Republicans or any other party to the conflict.'

Mr Parry said while he has not forgiven 
the IRA for the bombing, history was 'littered' with terrorists who had 
now become peace-makers.

He added that the foundation had an 'open door' policy and their founding principle was that all opinions from opposing sides of conflicts were welcome in the pursuit of peace.

'I would hope that the people outside, rather than criticise us for that, would recognise that's a different path but an honourable path,' he said.

Tim and Johnathan were killed when bombs planted in litter bins in the town's main shopping area were detonated shortly after midday on a sunny Saturday afternoon.

No warning was given and no one has been prosecuted for the attack on March 20 1993, that left 56 people injured.

Johnathan, three, was in the town with his babysitter to buy a card for Mother's Day, the next day, when he was killed.

Tim,
an Everton fan, had been shopping for football shorts when he caught 
the full force of the explosion. He died in his father's arms five days 
later in Liverpool's Walton Hospital.

The death of the two boys sparked a public outcry in the UK and on both sides of the border in Ireland.

Mr
Parry and Tim's mother, Wendy Parry, have set up the Tim Parry 
Johnathan Ball Foundation for Peace, which has since become an 
internationally recognised centre for conflict resolution and victim 
support.

One of the protesters outside the 
venue was Brian Hambleton, 58, who dropped off his sister Maxine at the 
Birmingham pub blasted by IRA bombs on the evening of November 21, 1974.

Mr Hambleton, from Birmingham, said: 'It makes me feel ill being within 100 yards of him. I'm here for a reason and that reason is that man's murky, violent past.

'He has to be answerable for his past before he goes forward with peace. He shouldn't be speaking in there, he should be on his knees begging people's forgiveness.

'This
town lost two beautiful young boys like I lost my sister. How Mr Parry 
can greet him and invite him here is beyond me. It is immoral.'
