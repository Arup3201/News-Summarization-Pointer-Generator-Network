Shamed solicitor Robert Cutty was jailed for two years after stealing £300,000 from clients

A disgraced solicitor who stole over £300,000 of his clients' cash has been jailed for two years.

Robert Cutty, 63, pocketed £140,000 of his trusting clients' money and transferred tens of thousands of pounds between customer accounts to try to cover his tracks.

The consultant solicitor, described by his lawyer as 'a man of great standing in the community', even took £50,000 from one client's estate to cover up a mistake he made on another.

But colleagues at the Harding, Swinburn and Jackson law firm in Sunderland discovered the extensive deception when Cutty was off work ill.

Cutty, whose wife was oblivious to his wrongdoings, was said to live 'beyond his means' in an old mansion with high running costs.

Cutty's activities began in 2003 when he transferred £33,000 from one client's account into his own.

He struck again in 2005, taking £52,500 from a dead client's estate.

The solicitor then transferred vast sums of money between client accounts to try to disguise the shortfall, helping himself to another £62,000.

He also moved £50,000 from one client to another to cover up having paid the amount to the client in error.

Colleagues caught him out in 2010, noticing discrepancies on his accounts when he was off sick.

A Solicitors' Regulatory Authority investigation identified the dishonest transactions.

Cutty was arrested and told police he had taken the money to cover 'living expenses'.

He pleaded guilty to four charges of obtaining by deception and five of fraud.

Michael Bunch, prosecuting, told Newcastle Crown Court: 'In total the amount covered by the nine counts is just over £300,000.

'Clearly some of the money was taken by him for his own purpose and some was to cover up earlier dishonest transactions.

'His personal benefit would appear to be in the region of £140,000.'It simply would appear to be a lifestyle lived beyond his means.'

The court was told that all clients, included the estates of two deceased customers, have been refunded.

Cutty had repaid £10,000 at the start of the fraud.

Jamie Adams, defending, said Cutty's activities began when he took money as a loan, claiming a client had authorised the move before she died.

The cash was used to settle a tax bill and then his finances grew out of control which led to more transactions and the extensive attempts at covering up his work.

Supporters of Cutty watched from the public gallery as Judge Michael Cartlidge jailed the shamed solicitor for two years.

The judge said: 'His problem is he is before the court for offending when he was in a position of trust in relation to clients at the firm.

'His behaviour has damaged the firm in all sorts of ways, not just in the very large cost of extra insurance but the cost of investigating the fraud and reputational damage.'

Mr Adams, who presented a stack of character testimonials at the start of the hearing, said: 'There is no lavish lifestyle here at all, nothing of that sort.

'He doesn’t have anything anymore.

'It is an appallingly sad situation when you consider he was a man of great standing in the community.'
