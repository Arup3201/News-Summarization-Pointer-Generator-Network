Every woman wants to be with him and every man wants to be him.

And it seems that men are now so desperate to emulate David Beckham's groomed look that they are even resorting to stealing their partner's beauty products to do so.

Britain’s metrosexual males are using £234 worth of their girlfriends’ and wives’ designer skin-care products every year in a bid to be like Becks.

The Becks effect: 46.4 per cent of British women said their men are pampering themselves pretty much on a daily basis with their beauty products to look like David Beckham

Nearly half of British women revealed that the man in their life is sneakily using their beauty products on a weekly basis – and they estimated that it costs them £19.50 a month on average.

In the past few years famous metrosexual men like David have changed perceptions on male grooming and now it’s much more acceptable for men to cleanse, tone and moisturise.

But in the new survey, 46.4 per cent of British women said their men are pampering themselves pretty much on a daily basis with their beauty products.

Most women (67.9 per cent) said their boyfriend or husband would regularly use day and night moisturiser– and over one in five said he would try to use their products sneakily when they weren’t looking.

By far the biggest gripe for women was that the metrosexual man in their life would turn his nose up at their cheaper products - 42.9 per cent of women said their man would always choose to use their most expensive skincare products.

And when they used the expensive lotions, 25 per cent said their man would be far too liberal with it.

This choice of designer skincare products was beginning to cost them around half of their monthly beauty spend of £39 because, in many cases, their boyfriend was using just as much of the skincare products as they were.

A spokesman for CEO of Escentual.com, who carried out the research, said: 'Twenty years ago most men wouldn’t have dreamed of using a moisturiser but nowadays it is much more common-place thanks to role models like David Beckham.

'But it’s clear that many men still haven’t got into the habit of actually buying their own beauty products and tend to use their partner’s moisturiser instead.

'What is especially cheeky is that the men generally turned their nose up at cheaper high-street moisturisers and only want to use their girlfriend’s more expensive premium brands like Clarins and Avene.'

Of the British wives and girlfriends questioned, they said the main reason that men weren’t buying their own products was because they hated shopping.

Nearly 40 per cent said their boyfriend couldn’t be bothered to look around the shops to get their own skincare products, and a further 21 per cent said that he would be too embarrassed to buy moisturiser in a high-street shop and would hate his male friends to know that he buys beauty products.

The spokesman added: 'Clearly there is still some stigma attached for men to buy beauty products in public, but mainly it’s because guys hate going shopping.

'This is why we have seen a marked increase for men buying skin-care products online because that way they can avoid feeling awkward in a shop.'
