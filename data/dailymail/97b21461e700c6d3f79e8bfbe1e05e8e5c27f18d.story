Parents who took their kids to see the new SpongeBob movie at a drive-in movie theater in California were horrified to find steamy bondage romp Fifty Shades Of Grey being shown on the adjacent screen.

Deborah Powell  brought a group of 12 children to see The SpongeBob Movie: Sponge Out Of Water on Sunday evening at West Wind Solano Drive-In in Concord, but was shocked when she was parking up and found it unavoidable for herself and her young passengers to see the screen showing Fifty Shades. 

'[On the screen] at the time there was a woman being slapped, naked, bound up… so, we had to have our children close their eyes,' she told KTVU.

Deborah Powell took a party of 12 people to the drive-in on Sunday evening to enjoy SpongeBob, but arrived to find scene of a woman being slapped unavoidable

'I could see another car behind us that had children in there with their eyes closed.'

The drive-In has two screens, one pointing north and one west, but both face the same general area making it unavoidable to see what is happening on both screens.

Powell said she complained to a theater worker, who told her that other parents had also expressed concerns about the bondage movie being played so close to a children's movie.

After trying and failing to shield her kids from the R-rated movie, Powell decided it was best to cancel the planned cinema trip and head home.

'There is no way to avoid looking at that screen. It's too tempting. So, we couldn't stay. So, we had to turn around. My children were devastated.'

Syufy Enterprises who run the theater have yet to comment on their decision to show the two movies at the same time. 

The R-rated movie, which cost only $40 million to produce, took in $93 million from 3,646 locations across the long President's Day holiday

SpongeBob dropped from number one to third on the weekend's list taking $40 million from 3,654 locations

The heat on Fifty Shades of Grey's blockbuster debut cooled ever so slightly as the final four-day weekend numbers were revealed on Tuesday.

The R-rated movie, which cost only $40 million to produce, took in $93 million from 3,646 locations across the long President's Day holiday.

Although initial estimates put the four-day gross at over $94 million, director Sam Taylor-Johnson's adaptation of EL James' steamy best seller still took crown for best February opening ever, unseating the 2004 record set by The Passion of the Christ. 

Matthew Vaughn's R-rated comic book adaptation Kingsman: The Secret Service also exceeded expectations in its first four days in theaters, bringing in $41.8 million from 3,204 locations, helping to solidify an overall record-breaking President's Day weekend at the box office. 

SpongeBob dropped from number one to third on the weekend's list taking $40 million from 3,654 locations.
