An Australian man is facing up to six years in jail over a motorbike crash that killed an Indonesian woman in Java.

Jake Drage, 23, has been West Java police custody since the collision happened on June 30.

Police on Friday said they had finished investigations and the former personal trainer would likely be charged with 'reckless' driving causing death.

If found guilty, Mr Drage faces a maximum six years in jail and/or a maximum fine of $1102.

The West Australian man was on a surfing holiday when his motorbike clipped another one.

According to his mother Tiena Drage, who has joined her son in Indonesia, the second bike was ridden by a teenage girl.

The crash injured her mother, who was riding on the back, and died the next day in hospital.

Police have confirmed they received a letter from the victim's family, saying they did not blame Mr Drage for the crash, which will be admitted as evidence at his trial and considered by the court.

In a statement released earlier this week, Mr Drage extended his sympathies to the family involved.

'The accident leaves me with a sadness that is very difficult to describe and I want to thank her family for all the kindness and goodwill they have shown me,' he said.

Drage had been receiving assistance from consular officials, the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade confirmed earlier this month.

Last week, The West Australian reported that Mr Drage pleaded his innocence on his Facebook page, claiming he is being held in jail near small West Java town Cimaja against the wishes of the family of the deceased.

'The police are holding me. I was awoken in a room, forced to sign some papers and was taken to another room. Something really dodgy is going on,' he said.

Mr Drage, from Geraldton - north of Perth, also wrote he was not driving dangerously nor was he intoxicated.

Last Thursday, his mother Tiena Drage posted on Facebook that the Australian Embassy had said her son had not been formally charged or arrested.

'They are just "keeping" him for now,' she wrote.

'The embassy staff will visit him tomorrow mainly to see how he is being treated and his well being.

'Will know more then.'

Drage could also face a $1102 fine if he is found guilty of causing the mother's death

Ms Drage has told local news website Everything Geraldton about the events before her son's accident last Monday.

She said he was facing uphill behind a small truck when he tried to see if it was safe to pass.

'All of a sudden a motorbike with two people on it was there and clipped Jake's bike.

'The bike was being driven by a 16-year-old girl, and her mother was on the back not wearing a helmet.'

The woman died on July 1 in hospital.

An online appeal has been launched to raise $5,000 to help bring Mr Drage back home.

'Our fun and kind-hearted Jake had been living his dream when a few days ago it all came crashing down,' friend Melissa Dowling wrote.

'We would like everyone to dig deep to help Jake.

'Please note that the family of the deceased have also tried to help Jake. They know he is not to blame.'

Drage's mother arrived in Indonesia on Saturday when she started speaking with lawyers.
