Guilty: Christine Monsheimer was sentenced to 18 months in prison

A mother of one has been sentenced to 18 months in prison for attacking another woman with a glass and slashing her face after she bumped into her while using a nightclub dance pole.

Christine Monsheimer's victim will be 'marked for life' after she was left with a cut that stretched 
from her top lip to the bottom of her chin.

She had to have 17 stitches to her face after Monsheimer pushed a 
tumbler into her face when she bumped into her on the dance floor.

Unemployed Monsheimer, 25, of Kirk Hallam in Derbyshire, pleaded guilty to wounding the woman in the Market Inn in Ilkeston, on February 25.

At Nottingham Crown Court, Judge Philip Head told her: ‘There is too much pub violence and the courts take it very seriously.

‘You put a mark on somebody’s face and after surgery it is likely she’ll be marked by what you did for the rest of her life.’

James Hett, prosecuting, said the victim was a pub customer and began to use the pole on the dance floor when she accidentally bumped into Monsheimer.

He added that a male customer saw the incident.

He said: ‘After the first accidental collision, he was fearful of the defendant’s subsequent response should the incident recur.

‘When the pair collided again, Monsheimer pushed her in the chest, then threw the contents of her glass into the woman’s face.

‘The two tried to hit each other, apparently without success.

‘The incident culminated with the 
defendant deliberately thrusting the glass she was holding towards the 
complainant. It came into contact with her face and the tumbler broke.’

The victim was treated at the Queen’s Medical Centre where she received stitches, but follow-up treatment will be needed.

Mr Hett said: ‘She was traumatised and felt she had been mutilated.

‘She has been reluctant to leave her home address ever since and found it difficult to go to activities in public.

‘She feels depressed and no longer feels safe to go into Ilkeston and has difficulty sleeping.’

David Outterside, mitigating, said: ‘This was inexcusable behaviour.

‘She wishes to say sorry to her victim for what she has done and the best expression of that is her guilty plea.’

The judge at Nottingham Crown Court (pictured) said there was 'too much pub violence and the courts take it very seriously'

He said she had a ‘happy home’ and provided stability for her child.

Her mother was babysitting on the night of the offence, the court was told.

Monsheimer had been drinking but was ‘not heavily intoxicated’, he said.

Mr
Outterside told the judge she is ‘not an unpleasant character’ and 
added that Monsheimer was terrified of the prospect of jail.
