A jury heard excerpts from James 'Whitey' Bulger's FBI informant file dating from the 1970s to 1990 in court today that show the former gangster provided information about a variety of people.

The files, read to the jury as part of Bulger's racketeering trial, show Bulger secretly informed on a range of criminals, including rival gangs, members of the Italian Mafia and people in his own South Boston neighborhood.

Bulger, 83, is standing trial on racketeering charges, including playing a role in 19 killings during the 1970s and '80s while allegedly leading the Winter Hill Gang. His lawyers have strongly denied that he was an FBI informant. Instead, they say, he paid certain FBI agents for information that would help him and his gang, including tip-offs on investigations and indictments.

At one point Monday, Bulger appeared to be visibly angry during arguments between his lawyer and the prosecution outside earshot of the jury. Several people heard him mutter an expletive and deny that he was an informant.

The jury spent the day listening to James Marra, a special agent with the Justice Department's Office of the Inspector General, read excerpts from Bulger's 700-page FBI file.

Marra said file documents show that 
Bulger began working as an informant in 1971, but was shut down after a 
short time after his FBI handler determined he was not providing useful 
information. Marra said Bulger became an informant again in 1975 for 
then-FBI Agent John Connolly and continued in that role almost 
continually for about 15 years, until Connolly retired.

Connolly was later convicted of racketeering for warning Bulger and his gang of an upcoming indictment, prompting Bulger to flee. Bulger was one of the nation's most wanted fugitives for more than 16 years when he was finally captured in Santa Monica, California in 2011.

Marra read reports written by Connolly 
and several supervisors at the FBI in which they described meetings they
had with Bulger and information he gave them about criminal activity 
ranging from drug trafficking to murder.

Marra
was asked to read several reports Connolly wrote about what Bulger 
allegedly told him about the killing of Edward 'Brian' Halloran in 1982.

Prosecutors
say Bulger and an associate gunned down Halloran after Connolly told 
him Halloran was talking to the FBI about Bulger's role in the 1981 
killing of an Oklahoma businessman. But in his conversations with 
Connolly, Bulger said he had heard on the street that the Mafia had 
killed Halloran. He later gave Connolly the names of some criminals from
Boston's Charlestown neighborhood he suggested may have killed 
Halloran.

Assistant U.S. 
Attorney Fred Wyshak asked Marra if, after reviewing the FBI file on 
Bulger, there was any doubt in his mind that Bulger was an FBI 
informant. Marra was not allowed to answer the question after Bulger's 
attorney, Hank Brennan, objected.

Brennan argued that Marra has no 
firsthand knowledge of whether Bulger was an informant. And the defense 
claims that Connolly fabricated all the reports in the FBI file to cover
up his own corruption.

But Wyshak argued that the file shows that Bulger provided information not just to Connolly, but to other FBI agents, including John Morris and James Ring, Connolly's supervisors.

'I understand that for whatever reasons - whether it's the ego of the defendant or attempting to preserve his reputation - he does not want to be called an informant, but I am not going to tailor my questions in a manner that preserves that ridiculous contention,' Wyshak said.

Judge Denise Casper sided with the defense.

Marra said Bulger told FBI agents about a litany of criminal activity involving a long list of people, including a group dealing heroin in a South Boston housing project and a man who was setting up an armored car robbery.

Morris is expected to be the next witness after Marra is cross-examined by Bulger's attorneys Tuesday.
