There are 9,000 British troops currently stationed in Afghanistan - but they are not the only UK natives struggling in the desert heat.

A team of bomb-sniffing dogs is at Camp Bastion alongside thousands of soldiers, sailors and airmen.

And despite the 30C (86F) temperatures which herald the start of summer, the animals have apparently been enjoying their stay in the warzone.

Dignified: American labrador Stomper stands guard next to his handler Lance Corporal Chris Slack

The labradors attached to 11 Explosive Ordnance Disposal were yesterday pictured taking time out during a training exercise at Bastion.

Wylie, a search dog, sheltered from the intense sun under a Mastiff armoured truck, while black labrador Misty played in the dust.

Stomper, an American labrador, appeared to stand guard while his comrades relaxed.

The unit, made up of troops from 15 different regiments, is responsible for dealing with improvised explosive devices (IEDs).

Helpful: Mister and the other dogs help troops by sniffing out IEDs and guarding sites

Comfortable: The animals appear to adapt to the harsh conditions more easily than humans

Military working dogs help their task by sniffing out explosives, searching buildings and guarding sensitive areas.

Corporal Marc Lawson, from the RAF police, is a dog handler responsible for Mister.

'They are working dogs and they are happy in the conditions out here,' he said.

'They see it as a game and really enjoy their work. Mister particularly loves catching a ball.'

The dogs are based at kennels in Camp
Bastion, and then deployed out to forward operating bases and patrol 
bases to carry out their work.

Each
has its own handler responsible for its welfare - for example, they 
always have access to water to quench their thirst in the harsh 
conditions.
