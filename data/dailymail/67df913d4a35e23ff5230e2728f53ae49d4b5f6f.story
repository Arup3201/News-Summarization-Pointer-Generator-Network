One major trend emerged from Monday's transfer deadline day — the growing importance of the loan.

Nearly half of all deals in a final 24 hours of trading were loans rather than permanent transfers — Radamel Falcao, Javier Hernandez, Lewis Holtby, Marco van Ginkel and Sebastian Coates among them.

Over the weekend, Chelsea’s £50million striker Fernando Torres completed an unprecedented two-year loan to AC Milan.

Once the domain of lower league clubs from who couldn’t rub two ha’pennies together, being involved in a loan deal is now the ultimate status symbol of the super-rich.

It was fitting that Chelsea did the Torres deal with one of Italy’s biggest clubs. Nobody has embraced the fashion for loans more than Roman Abramovich, who has allowed two entire teams of Chelsea players to be ‘borrowed’ by other clubs, usually with a fee involved.

It’s become an important new revenue stream for the Chelsea, who signed goalkeeper Thibaut Courtois at 19 and promptly let him go to Atletico Madrid for three seasons while retaining his registration.

That only tells half the story though. Uefa financial fair play restrictions and escalating transfer fees mean even the biggest revenue earners like Manchester United have to keep a close eye on spending if they don’t want to fall foul of the new rules.

Hence on Monday they became one of many big clubs to embrace the loan, agreeing to pay a £6m fee plus mega-wages to take Falcao from Monaco for a year. Not to be outdone, Real Madrid agreed to take Javier Hernandez from Old Trafford in similar circumstances.

United’s decision to sign Falcao initially for just a year makes sense. Having splashed out £200m in the last 12 months on Marouane Fellaini, Juan Mata, Luke Shaw, Ander Herrera and Marcos Rojo, another £50m on Falcao was considered excessive at Old Trafford.

Yet Louis van Gaal wanted the player and Monaco knew the Colombian was fed up playing in front of minuscule crowds in the south of France.

To all concerned, a loan was the perfect answer. United have got a world-class player for a relatively low fee and Monaco’s own FFP concerns are eased by getting the Colombian’s estimated £300,000-a-week wages off their books.

FFP was once derided as impossible to enforce. In fact, it’s had a major impact.

Manchester City and Paris Saint-Germain will play with reduced squads in the Champions League this season for breaking FFP rules. Another offence and Uefa may kick them out of next year’s competition. Other clubs have taken note.

To avoid sanction for over-spending, clubs, agents and players have found their short-term fix. It’s called a loan.
