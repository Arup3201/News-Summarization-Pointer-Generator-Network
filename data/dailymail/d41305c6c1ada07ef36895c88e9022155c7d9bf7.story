A devout Muslim grandmother has been jailed for four years for kidnapping and drugging her own daughter after she refused to marry the man her family wanted her to.

Mother-of-eight Shamim Akhtar, 59, was jailed with her son Shamrez Khan and her son-in-law Zahid Mahmood for abusing Naila Afsar, then 23, out of 'some misplaced sense of warped family honour'.

Khan, 34, was given a five-year sentence and Mahmood, 37, was jailed for four years at Burnley Crown Court today.

Sentencing Akhtar, Judge Simon Newell
 told her: 'She's your youngest daughter and your role was to care for 
her, support her and look after her best interests.

'Instead you chose to control, drug and abuse her in the interests of the family reputation.'

Akhtar,
 of Bradford, was found guilty of kidnap, false imprisonment and two 
counts of administering a drug after a four-week trial at Preston Crown 
Court earlier this year.

Khan,
 of Bradford, and Mahmood, of Accrington, Lancashire, both pleaded 
guilty to the same offences part-way through the same trial.

Mrs
 Afsar's family had lined up a marriage for her with her cousin but, 
after some time together, she decided she wanted to end that 
relationship, the court heard.

She
 came under sustained pressure from her family in Bradford to the extent
 that she fled to Newcastle, where she thought they would not find her.

In Newcastle, she met postgraduate student Afsar Saddiq. They started a relationship and later married.

Once
 settled, Mrs Afsar tried to re-establish a relationship with her family
 but they began to pressure her again to divorce and restart the 
relationship with her cousin.

Things
 came to a head in January 2010 when Khan, his mother and others 
travelled to Newcastle, broke into Mrs Afsar's flat and threatened her 
and her husband.

She was taken to Accrington where various attempts were made to change her mind.

At one point her mother said to Mrs Afsar that she was 'worse than a prostitute, you should be killed', the court heard.

Judge Newell said: 'She resisted these attempts and she stood up to you.'

He said Khan, who was effectively the head of the family, pushed and slapped his sister.

Khan thought his sister's actions had 'brought shame and disgrace on the family, had impugned their honour'.

Eventually,
 Mrs Afsar was made to drink a milky liquid which contained the drug 
lorazepam - described in court today as a 'date rape drug'.

She was bundled into a car in an attempt to force her to go from Accrington to Bradford, against her will.

But the police were alerted and officers pulled the vehicle over.

Judge
 Newell praised Mrs Afsar, saying she was an 'intelligent, educated and 
articulate young woman', adding that she was 'independent, determined 
and resourceful'.

He said: 'She epitomised a modern young Asian woman making her life as a citizen of this country.'

Judge
 Newell told the three defendants he accepted that while people want to 
do what they think is best for their children, everyone is subject to 
the law.

He said: 'Adult, educated, intelligent and independent children have a right to self-determination and freedom of choice.

'These
 rights have been hard-won over many years - particularly in the case of
 women - and are fiercely protected by the courts.'

Speaking
 after the hearing, Detective Inspector Mark Vaughton, from Lancashire 
Police, said: 'This has been a very difficult and traumatic experience 
for the victim, who was forced into hiding to escape abuse from members 
of her own family.

'She was
 treated in the most dreadful way by the people who were supposed to 
protect and care for her. She has shown a great deal of courage in 
coming forward and we will continue to offer her support for as long as 
she needs it.'
