Gerald Sargent discovered he had won more than 120 times when he contacted National Savings and Insurance

Gerald Sargent thought he might be unluckier than most.

While friends and family seemed to be regularly winning cash prizes on the Premium Bonds, his numbers had not come up for years.

So the 80-year-old contacted National Savings and Investments (NS&I), which runs the scheme, and was staggered to discover that he had won 124 times over the past decade.

He is now celebrating a Christmas windfall of £5,325 after the cheques were mailed – plus a 125th pay-out for £2,094.94 in compensation to make up for the interest he lost out on.

Mr Sargent, who has four grandchildren, said yesterday that the happy ending to his story should serve as a lesson to other bond holders who could be sitting on a pot of unclaimed cash.

‘I rang to ask if they had lost me in the system,’ said the keen fisherman from Swadlincote, Derbyshire.

‘They initially found I had won 10 times this year but I hadn’t received any winnings.

‘Two hours later I got a call from the manager saying I had won more than 120 times.

‘When I took the cheques to the bank the cashier couldn’t believe it. He nearly blew up the machine trying to process them.

‘I just want to urge people – particularly those like me who have endured a long, dry spell – to check and see if they have won as it could be a nice Christmas.

‘I have to survive on pensions worth a combined £170-a-week and this money could have made a big difference to my life.

‘As it is, I’ve had to drop out of clubs I was involved in – such as diving and fishing. I just couldn’t afford the fuel costs of a 40-mile round-trip to the dive club, for instance, let alone trips to Holyhead or Grimsby to go sea fishing as much as I’d like.’

Mr Sargent said his first win on the Premium Bonds was a £5 prize in the late 1950s. ‘I nearly tore the envelope up, thinking it was a tax demand from the revenue’, he said.

‘It was only my mother telling me to have a look at what was inside first that stopped me.’

He
 steadily built up his investment in bonds during a varied working life 
in which he spent 12 years as quartermaster on the Queen Mary passenger 
liner, followed by stints in the merchant navy and as a supplier of 
turf, before eventually settling down to run a wool shop in Swadlincote 
with his former wife.

The couple divorced after the business closed in 1999, by which point Mr Sargent had amassed the maximum £20,000 premium bondholding allowed.

When the limit was increased to £30,000 in 2003 – and the top prize raised to £1million – he gradually raised his holding to the new limit.

His problems seem to have started the following year, when an NS&I letter to him was returned as ‘undeliverable’ by Royal Mail.

NS&I told the Daily Mail that, while it was still investigating what happened, usually in such a situation it would assume that the customer had moved house and wait for him to contact them, which happened only this September.

A spokesman apologised for the delay in getting Mr Sargent’s winnings to him.
