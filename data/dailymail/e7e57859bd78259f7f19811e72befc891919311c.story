A Liberal MP publicly confused the logo of a nightclub event with an Islamic flag popular among jihadists.

West Australian backbencher Luke Simpkins spotted several stickers plastered over the Leederville Railway Station footbridge in Perth in November.

'I noticed black disks that appeared to be Shahada symbols,' he wrote on his public Facebook page, referring to the Islamic Flag.

But Daily Mail Australia can reveal they were actually logos for Speakeasy, a Perth nightclub event which has hosted popular musicians including Flume and Nina Las Vegas.

The Shahada flag: It features a common Islamic expression but has been co-opted by jihadists

'It's definitely nothing to do with Islamic Anything,' event manager Pierce Ericson said in an interview. 

The black Shahada flag is a common expression of Islamic faith but has been co-opted by jihadists.

The Speakeasy logo features white, cursive writing on a black background. 

After noticing the stickers, Mr Simpkins called the office of Transport Minister Dean Nalder and requested they be removed. 

He later congratulated Mr Nalder and an adviser for 'getting them painted over quickly after my call'.

Mr Simpkins was not available for comment, however his Facebook post was taken down following Daily Mail Australia's questions.  

Mr Ericson, from Metric Promotions, said the stickers had been placed on the bridge 'two or three years ago'.

'We're trying not to take it seriously but it's certainly pretty ridiculous,' said Mr Ericson, who laughed after hearing about the incident.

Several punters responded to Mr Simpkins' post with social media mockery.

Seat of power: Liberal backbencher Luke Simpkins has been vocal about the threat posed by Islamic State militants

'"Speakeasy" the club where all radical muslims attend to discuss how they're going to take over Perth,' wrote Pat Stevenson. 

'I tried going there to organise a jihad but I couldn't hear anyone over that very new age definition of prayer music that constantly plays at a loud volume,' quipped Rob Grimsey.  

Last year, Mr Simpkins spoke about Australian militants embracing the Islamic State terror group under the Shahada flag in a speech to Federal Parliament.  

'These people make a personal decision to betray their country and follow the black flag of Shahada and the Islamic State,' he said. 

The white writing on the Shahada flag reads: 'There is no god but Allah; Muhammad is the Messenger of Allah.'

Islamic community leader Keysar Trad told Daily Mail Australia: 'The words themselves are very significant for Muslims.

'Unfortunately anybody who thinks they can gain more following by using this banner they end up using it.' 

A spokeswoman for WA Transport Minister Dean Nalder said Mr Simpkins contacted his office after spotting 'illegal graffiti'. 

'Main Roads WA appropriately investigated and acted on the concern, concealing and then repainting the section of the bridge that was illegally defaced,' she said.
