A mysterious green cloud of smoke was spotted by startled residents yesterday as it rose above their homes.

The plume of smoke spewed from a waste disposal site in Cadishead, Salford.

Fire crews called to CSG Lanstar in 
Liverpool Road discovered that the cloud had been caused by an exothermic reaction in a drum shredding machine.

Unusual sight: The cloud turned out that it was not as poisonous as it looked as the green tinge was caused by print toner and was harmless

But it turned out that it was not as poisonous as it looked as the cloud’s green tinge was caused by print 
toner and was harmless.

Firefighters arrived at the scene at around 2pm yesterday and staff at the plant had already used Soda-Ash to extinguish the reaction.

Local people who spotted the toxic-looking cloud took to Twitter to voice their concern.

To which WhithamRM responded: 'Glad you can see it to #notseeingthings #greencloud.'

Jen Cartmell, from CSG Landstar said: 'Health and Safety procedures are strictly observed on our site and although the incident was minor we will carry out a full investigation to determine how the fire happened in the first place.'

Greater Manchester Fire and Rescue Service (GMFRS) said no hazardous chemicals were involved in the blaze.

A GMFRS spokesperson said: 'It was a fire involving a drum-shredding machine. The on-site staff had managed to put out the fire using soda ash.

'The green tinge in the smoke was the result of phosphorus which the on-site chemist said was nothing more than normal smoke and not harmful to the public.'

It's not the first time a green clouds have been spotted this year. Fears spread in April when green clouds were seen in the skies over Moscow but experts determined it was due to birch pollen.
