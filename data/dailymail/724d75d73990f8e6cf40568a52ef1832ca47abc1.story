'Experienced golfer': The jury heard that Leigh Neilly, 41, had a handicap of 11

A man who pocketed £38,000 in disability allowance was filmed by investigators taking part in a golf competition, a court has heard.

Leigh Neilly entered a claim for Disability Living Allowance in 2001, stating he could barely walk or carry out everyday tasks unaided as he was suffering from motor neurone disease.

In the nine years he was claiming benefits, the 41-year-old was paid a total of £38,748 by the Department of Work and Pensions.

But a surveillance operation carried out by the DWP in April 2010 filmed Neilly, of Silloth, Cumbria, striking golf balls with ease, riding a bike one-handed and carrying out renovation work on his home.

Carlisle Crown Court was shown footage of Leigh Neilly lifting a golf club high above his head to strike balls on a course which is described as 'undulating' and 'demanding'.

He was also filmed lying down on the ground to paint a gate at his home and bending down to rummage through boxes at a market.

The defendant, who switched to 
representing himself mid-way through yesterday's proceedings, has been 
charged with two counts relating to benefit fraud.

Alan Robinson, chief investigator at the DWP, filmed Neilly at Silloth car boot sale shopping for records, which showed Nielly bending down to look at some LPs in boxes for several minutes.

Giving evidence at the trial Mr Robinson said: 'The defendant did not use a walking aid or seek assistance. He did not fall over or stumble. He did not walk at anything other than a normal pace.

'There were no indications he was in any pain at all.'

In another clip shown to the jury Neilly can be seen lying on the ground, painting a gate.

Mr Robinson told the court: 'I did not at any point see him fall, stumble, drop his paint brush or show any obvious signs of pain.'

He added that Neilly had cycled to the shops and back before resuming the painting.

Neilly was also filmed completing the fourth to fifteenth holes at Silloth Golf Course with some companions as part of a competition. The court was told Neilly regularly plays competitive golf, and has a handicap of 11.

While Neilly said in his disibility claims that his legs are prone 'to giving way at any time', Mr Robinson said that at no point did the defendant stumble, fall or show any obvious signs of discomfort.

He added: 'The course is undulating, it is quite a demanding course, it is a championship course.'

As the footage played, prosecutor Tim Evans said: 'Mr Neilly dose not appear to be holding anyone back, he is leading the way to the next tee.'

The barrister estimated the length of the course was just under four miles long, although Neilly had only been filmed completing the fourth to fifteen holes.

The court in Carlisle heard that Neilly 'would lead the way to the next tee' while playing competitive golf

At the start of proceedings Neilly stated that he no longer wished to be represented by his barrister. He will represent himself throughout the rest of the trial.

Representing himself this afternoon, Leigh Nielly asked for the DVD footage to be replayed to the court and stopped at certain points.

Then, indicating the television screen he said: 'I am using a motorised trolley on the golf course.'

Halting the DVD for a second time Nielly continued: 'What I am doing here is taking a pain killer. I am having a drink and taking a pain killer.'

Addressing Mr Robinson, Nielly said: 'Can you tell if I am in any pain or discomfort?'

'I can look at you and see there are no signs you are in any pain or discomfort,' Mr Robinson replied.

'Can you feel my discomfort?' Nielly asked again.

'No, I cannot feel anybody else's discomfort,' said Mr Robinson.

Phyllis Duffy, a decision maker for the DWP, told the court: 'Disability living allowance is a benefit for the severely disabled. It depends on the needs that arise from the disability and not on the disability itself.

'People with individual disabilites cope differently with them. It all depends on the individual.'

She told the court that Neilly had stated in application forms for 
benefit that he was so 'severely disabled he was virtually unable to 
walk'.

Mr Evans asked Mrs Duffy if the disability allowance would have been paid to Neilly had she been aware of what he was able to do.

'No,' she replied.

Neilly, of Wampool Street, Silloth, Cumbria denies dishonest representation for the purposes of obtaining benefits.

He denies a further charge of dishonestly failing to notify a change in circumstances, affecting his entitlement to benefit.

The trial continues.
