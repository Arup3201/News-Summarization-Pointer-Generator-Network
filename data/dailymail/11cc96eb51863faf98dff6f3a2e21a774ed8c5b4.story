Few people live to tell the tale of being trapped on a large ship sinking in the middle of the open sea.

But now terrifying footage has emerged capturing exactly what it would be like to be stuck on board a vessel as it goes down - slowly disappearing into the deep as waves crash all around.

The chilling film was shot on board the The Pocahontas, also known as The Danny, using high-definition GoPro cameras as it sank in the middle of Lake Worth in Florida last year.

Calm: The footage begins with The Pocahontas appearing to take on a small amount of water as it sails on Lake Worth in Florida

Sinking: The more water the ship takes on, the heavier it becomes, pushing the vessel increasingly lower until water begins crashing over its sides

We're going down: Very quickly the ship begins to tilt to the left, allowing the water to completely cover the deck

Eerie: The footage then becomes slightly unsteady and the water fills with bubbles - both of which gives the terrifying impression of someone gasping for air as they are sucked below the surface

The footage begins with The Pocahontas appearing to take on a small amount of water as it sails on a relatively calm Lake Worth.

The more water the ship takes on, the heavier it becomes, pushing the vessel increasingly lower until water begins lapping over its sides.

Very quickly the ship begins to tilt to the left, allowing the water to almost completely cover the deck.

The sheer weight of the water continues to drag the port side of the ship down, and within seconds the camera itself is under water.

The footage then becomes slightly unsteady and the water fills with bubbles - both of which gives the terrifying impression of someone gasping for air as they are sucked below the surface.

After several disorientating moments of the camera being struck by debris, the footage eventually settles into an eerie calm as the ship appears to come to a rest on the bed of the lake.

The video then cuts to another camera positioned inside what appears to be the ship's hull.

Although dimly lit, several shards of daylight force their way into the hull - letting the viewer know that the footage is once again back before the ship sunk.

The vessel begins to rock however, and after one particularly large lurch forward water begins gushing into the interior - filling it from floor to ceiling in little over a second.

The footage was published on YouTube by Little Deeper Charters - the owners of a chartered diving ship which operates out of Lake Park in Florida

Once again debris crashes into the camera before everything goes eerily calm - the viewer given a strange insight into what it must be like to have gone down with a ship.

The footage, published by the Palm Beach Country Dive Association and Little Deeper Charters - the owners of a chartered diving ship which operates out of Lake Park in Florida.

According to the company's YouTube channel the cameras were installed on The Pocahontas by Dean Shuler of Pura Vida Divers shortly before it went down in February 2013.

The doomed vessel remains 75 feet below the surface of Lake Worth, in a stretch of water close to Singer Island.
