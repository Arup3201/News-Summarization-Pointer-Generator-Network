In his own words: Jay Wilds exclusively spoke to The Intercept about the 1999 killing of Hae Min Lee for the first time since the trial of Adnan Syed

Nearly two weeks after the hit podcast Serial finished its triumphant 12-episode run, Jay Wilds, a key figure in the engrossing real-life murder mystery, broke his silence for the first time about the 1999 case.

Listeners of the spinoff podcast of the long-running radio program This American Life know Jay as the star witness for the prosecution in the state's case against Adnan Syed.

As part of a plea deal, Wilds testified against Syed saying that the popular Woodlawn High School student strangled to death his ex-girlfriend, Hae Min Lee, because he was angry she had broken up with him.

Wilds told detectives he helped Syed bury Lee's body in a Baltimore park but vehemently denied taking part in the 1999 killing.

In December 2000, Syed was convicted of murder and received a life sentence. Wilds avoided prison time altogether.

Journalist Sarah Koenig, who had spent more than a year reinvestigating the January 1999 murder of Hae Min Lee for Serial, raised serious questions about Wilds' involvement in the case and his motives, methodically picking apart his testimony during the trial.

In an exclusive interview with The Intercept, which will be published in several installments beginning this week, Mr Wilds, who is married and has children, took Koenig to task for misrepresenting him.

Offering his side of the story for the first time since the Syed trial, Wilds largely stuck to his version of events from 15 years ago, saying that Adnan talked to him about killing Hae a week before she went missing.

But those who listened closely to the wildly popular podcast will notice some discrepancies in Wilds’ latest version of events.

'It was at least a week before she died, when he found out she was either cheating on him or leaving him,' Wilds told The Intercept.

'We were in the car, we were riding, smoking. He just started opening up... Just normal conversation ike, "I think she’s fucking around. I’m gonna kill that bitch, man."'

However, Sarah Koenig reported that Adnan and Hae had broken up weeks before she was strangled to death and dumped in Baltimore's notorious Leakin Park.

Wilds went on to say that to him, Adnan's threats sounded like nothing more than the rants of a jilted teenager 'blowing off steam.'

'I thought at worst he'd throw a rock through her window or something,' Wilds told the reporter.

Turning to the question of a motive, Wilds claimed that the breakup had a devastating effect on Adnan because to him the relationship meant much more than it did to Hae.

According to Wilds, when Hae decided to leave him, Adnan was left feeling like a 'loser,' which pained him greatly.

'What else could motivate you to choke the life out of someone you cared about?' Wilds speculated. 'He just couldn’t come to grips with those feelings… He failed; he lost the girl.

Calling to mind the day of Hae's murder, Wilds said he did not know his friend was planning to kill his ex-girlfriend when Adnan loaned him his car and cellphone after school.

According to Wilds, it was not until he picked Adnan up later in the day on January 13, 1999, that the high school senior told him he had killed Hae.

Although during police questioning, and later during the trial, Wilds testified that he first saw the girl's body in the trunk of her car outside a Best Buy store, in The Intercept interview he claimed it happened outside his grandmother's house.

‘I didn’t tell the cops it was in front of my house because I didn’t want to involve my grandmother,' he explained the discrepancy.

Wilds said when he finally saw Hae's body, she looked 'purple' and her legs dressed in stockings were tucked behind her.

According to Wilds, Adnan forced him into helping him bury Hae's body by threatening to turn him in to police for running a drug dealing operation out of his grandmother's house.

‘Adnan says, “Just help me dig the hole.” And I’m still thinking, “Inner-city black guy, selling pot to high school kids.” The cops are going to fry me. They’re gonna pin me to the f***ing wall,’ he told the website.

Inconsistencies: While during the trial Wilds said he first saw Hae's body in the trunk of her car outside this Best Buy, in the interview with The Intercept he said it took place outside his grandmother's house

Burial ground: Wilds admitted to have assisted Syed in burying Lee's body at Leakin Park in Baltimore 

In Sarah Koenig’s podcast, much has been made of the many inconsistencies, both big and small, in Jay Wilds’ story, and how it kept changing over time, from his first interview with police to his testimony in Syed’s second trial.

Addressing the discrepancies, Wilds said initially he was not willing to cooperate with police for fear of incriminating himself as a drug dealer, and also because he did not want to get his friends in trouble in connection to the Hae murder.

‘I wasn’t fully cooperating, so if they said, “Well, we have on phone records that you talked to Jenn.” I’d say, “Nope, I didn’t talk to Jenn.” Until Jenn told me that she talked with the cops and that it was ok if I did too.

‘That’s the best way I can account for the inconsistencies. Once the police made it clear that my drug dealing wasn’t gonna affect the outcome of what was going on, I became a little bit more transparent,’ he said.

Sarah Koenig wrapped up Season 1 of Serial December 18, saying in conclusion that while she cannot say with certainty that Adnan Syed is innocent, based on the circumstantial evidence presented by the prosecution during the trial, he should have never been convicted of the murder.

The Innocence Project at the University of Virginia has taken up Syed’s case at Koenig’s request and has identified alternative suspects, including a serial rapist who died in prison several years ago.

in September, Maryland's Court of Special Appeals asked the state to respond to arguments about Syed's alibi and previous attorney.

Syed's attorney Justin Brown said the Court of Special Appeals will decide whether to hear the appeal and if it does, whether Syed, now 34, deserves a new trial.
