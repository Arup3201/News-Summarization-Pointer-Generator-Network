The White House formally submitted an emergency request to Congress on Tuesday for $3.7 billion in additional funding for security measures and humanitarian efforts at the U.S. border with Mexico.

Nearly half of the money the White House is asking for would go toward providing housing and medical services for illegal immigrant children.

Another third would go toward the Immigration Customs and Enforcement agency.

But only $116 million of the $1.1 billion set aside for ICE would be used to deport the unaccompanied minors at the center of the humanitarian crisis on the border.

The bulk of that money the White House wants Congress to appropriate to ICE, $879 million, would go toward detaining and deporting adults who are accompanied by children when they cross the border.

President Barack Obama wants $1.1 billion for humanitarian services for illegal immigrant children but only a tenth as much for efforts for deportation costs

Today's request follows a letter from the president to congressional leaders last Monday outlining the challenges the administration is facing on the border.

In that letter, the president indicated that he would like to see changes to a 2008 trafficking law that the administration says is slowing down its deportation efforts and additional money appropriated to various agencies that handle illegal immigration.

The president said would be reaching out to Congress when it returned from recess this week with a specific sum.

White House 
officials told the Associated Press that they planned to ask Congress for more than $2 billion on Tuesday.

When the final language came back today, the president asked for nearly double that amount.

Among the requests for emergency funding were: $45 million for an additional 40 teams of immigration judges, $295 million for Central American countries to address the root causes of  mass migration of children to the U.S. and $5 million for a campaign to discourage parents in Central America from sending their children with smugglers.

Crisis: More than 47,000 unaccompanied children have entered the country illegally since Oct. 1, including 9,700 in the Month of May alone

Hot seat: Secretary of Homeland Security Jeh Johnson said Sunday that 'we need to find more efficient, effective ways to turn this tide around'

Missing 
from the White House's petition were detailed changes to the 2008 law the administration has consistently blamed for the humanitarian
 crisis on the border.

That law, passed by a Democrat-controlled Congress, was meant to provide protection for children brought into the U.S. as part of human trafficking schemes, mostly related to the illicit sex trade.

In the absence of a move on Capitol Hill, the federal government has no choice but to treat the deluge of illegal immigrant children arriving from Central American countries the same way.

That process can take weeks or months and tie up resources – including U.S. Border Patrol agents – making the border even more porous.

The White House's chief spokesman admitted Monday that most on the tens of 
thousands of unaccompanied illegal immigrant children crossing the 
U.S.-Mexico border are unlikely to qualify for humanitarian relief 
that would prevent them from being sent back from their home countries.

However, the 2008 law requires that  illegal immigrant children who come to the U.S. from non-contiguous 
countries are provided due process before they are sent back home.

President
 Barack Obama told congressional leaders in his letter last week that his 
administration would seek an amendment to the law that would allow the 
Department of Homeland Security more latitude to fast-track deportations of children from Guatemala, El Salvador and Guatemala.

He did not include specific language his administration would like to see added to the law at that time, and all the president said on the matter in a 
letter accompanying his budgetary request today is that the administration 
would continue to work with Congress to make the previously recommended 
legislative changes.

White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest 
said this afternoon that senior White House administration officials and
 and senior-level congressional leaders had been in talks since last 
week about changes to the law but they had not yet come to an agreement.

Earnest was unable to explain what changes to the law the administration would like to see Congress make, saying only that the White House is seeking additional authorization for greater discretion in enforcing that law.

However he  did say the administration is not proposing to eliminate due process or medical screenings for illegal immigrant children.

What steps the administration intends to have Congress cut out of the processing requirements for illegal immigrant children to be sent back home if not one of the main requirements is clear as mud.

In a statement addressing the president's request for additional funding, Michael Steel, a spokesman for House Speaker John Boehner, told reporters: 'The Appropriations Committee and other Members, including the working group on the border crisis led by Rep. Kay Granger, will review the White House proposal.

'The Speaker still supports deploying the National Guard to provide humanitarian support in the affected areas - which this proposal does not address,' he said.

Asked about both Boehner and Texas Governor Rick Perry's calls for the president to send the National Guard to Rio Grande river area in Texas, Earnest said, 'There already has been made a historic investment in border security, and we're seeing the benefits of that investment along the border.'

Department of Homeland Security, Immigration and Customs Enforcement - $1.1 billion$116 million would pay for transportation costs for unaccompanied minors.$109 million would support other immigration and customs enforcement efforts.$879 million would pay for detention and deportation of adults traveling with children who enter the United States illegally, including the expansion of alternatives to detention programs and prosecution capacity.

Department of Homeland Security, Customs and Border Protection - $433 million$364 million would pay for operational costs$29 million would  be appropriated to CBP to expand its role in Border Enforcement Security Task Force programs.$39.4 million would go to increasing air surveillance of the border.

Department of Justice - $64 million$45.4 million would go toward hiring approximately 40 additional immigration judge teams.$2.5 million would be used to expand a program that provides legal assistance to adults and guardians of children in the immigration court system$15 million would help fund legal representation for children in immigration proceedings$1.1 million would be used to hire additional immigration litigation attorneys

Department of State and Other International Programs - $300 million$295 million would go to Central American countries for repatriation and reintegration efforts, border security and programs that address the root causes of mass migration.$5 million would support media campaigns in Mexico, Guatemala, El Salvador, and Honduras explaining that unaccompanied minors will not receive amnesty in the U.S. This category of money would also support youth leadership development programs.

Department of Health and Human Services - $1.8 billionAll of this money would go toward caring for illegal immigrant children who cross the border and includes money to fund additional housing facilities and medical treatment.
