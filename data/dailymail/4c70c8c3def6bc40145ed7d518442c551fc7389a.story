North Korean leader Kim Jong Un is set to make his first foreign trip since taking power three years ago, after accepting an invitation from Russia.

He is among 26 world leaders who have agreed to attend celebrations marking the 70th anniversary of the Soviet Union's victory over Nazi Germany.

North Korea has not officially commented, but its leader's planned visit was today confirmed by Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov.

First trip: North Korean leader Kim Jong Un has accepted an invitation from Russia to attend celebrations marking the 70th anniversary of the Soviet Union's victory over Nazi Germany

Event planning: Russian President Vladimir Putin attends a meeting of the Victory Day celebrations organising committee in the Kremlin today

The announcement comes just a day after Russian President Vladimir Putin reappeared in public after an unusually long 10-day absence that unleashed frenzied speculation about his whereabouts.

The highlight of the May 9 celebrations will be a military parade in the Red Square overseen by President Putin.

It is an annual event that will be expanded this year to include 15,000 troops, cadets and Cossacks, according to Russia's defense minister.

Several Western leaders have snubbed invitations to the military parade because of Russia's role in the Ukraine conflict.  

German Chancellor Angela Merkel is among those staying away from the parade, but she softened the snub by deciding to visit Moscow the next day for a separate ceremony with Putin.

The foreign minister said Merkel's decision to come to Moscow has helped to wreck the 'anti-Russian campaign'.

He said some European leaders were still expected to come, including those from Slovakia, Norway, Greece and several Balkan nations.

In addition to Kim, the leaders of China, Cuba, India, Mongolia, South Africa and Vietnam have confirmed their attendance. 

Russian President Vladimir Putin on Monday reappeared in public after an unusually long 10-day absence that unleashed frenzied speculation about the whereabouts and health of the Russian strongman.

Looking pale, Putin met with Kyrgyz President Almazbek Atambayev at the sumptuous Konstantinov's Palace just outside Saint Petersburg, an AFP correspondent reported.

Putin, commenting on suggestions that he had been forced to lie low because of ill health, said that life without gossip would be 'boring'.

He refused to explain his absence since March 5.

The Bishkek leader claimed Putin was fit - and in macho mode.

'The president of Russia isn't just walking, he's hot-rodding around, driving his guests around behind the wheel,' said Atambayev. 

'Vladimir Vladimirovich (Putin) just drove me around the territory. That's just so there's no rumours.' 

Putin's absence occurred amid rumours of illness, a coup, or his Olympic gymnast 'lover' Alina Kabayeva giving birth to a child in Switzerland.

He vanished soon after aides to one of his key allies were blamed for ordering the assassination of one of the Kremlin's most outspoken critics, Boris Nemtsov.
