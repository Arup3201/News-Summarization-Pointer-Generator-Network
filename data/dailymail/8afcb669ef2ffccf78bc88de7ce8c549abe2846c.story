Health and social services staff have been criticised in a report into the 'preventable' death of a five-month-old baby who died from acute rickets.

The parents of Ndingeko Kunene were jailed for manslaughter by gross negligence last week after they failed to obtain medical help for their sick child.

Nkosiyapha, 36, and Virginia Kunene, 32, who are members of the Seventh-day Adventist Church, prayed for their child's recovery rather than seek medical help, the Old Bailey heard.

The couple refused medical treatment for their son on religious grounds until he died from a severe vitamin D deficiency.

A Serious Case Review has now found a catalogue of failures and says: 'A number of opportunities to protect the baby were missed.'

The report, published today, says there was a 'consistent lack or professional curiosity' into the family, from Erith, Kent.

The report, which calls the infant 'Baby F', says the attitude of health visitors was 'extremely optimistic' and there was a lack of monitoring by agencies and a failure of communication between them.

The family doctor failed to promote vitamin D and staff were confused over forms.

The report, from Bexley Local Safeguarding Children Board, said: 'This was a preventable death and a number of opportunities to protect Baby F were missed.

'The GP should have been aware of the importance of breastfeeding mothers to take vitamin D supplements and this would have been even more relevant in Mrs F’s case.

'The health visitor’s visit was extraordinarily optimistic and the parents were seen to be very co-operative.

'There was a lack of any agency checks, which if undertaken is likely to have provided a more complete picture of the risks.'

The report says the baby had not been seen by any professionals in the three and a half months prior to his death.

It says: 'The nature of the spiritual beliefs and sanctions articulated by his mother were extreme and should have raised both concern and questioning.

'There was a consistent lack of professional curiosity and challenge to both parents and other professionals.

'During this period (after Ndingeko was born) communications between professionals does not appear to have been effective in particular between the hospital, the GP and the health visitor.'

The report added: 'There were three separate occasions when concerns should have been raised. This included the rapid response meeting.

Rickets is a disease, which affects bone development in children. The condition causes bones to become soft and weak, leading to deformities.

In adults the disease is referred to as osteomalacia or soft bones.

The most common cause of rickets is a lack of Vitamin D and calcium. Vitamin D is essential for children to form strong bones and comes from exposure to sunlight. It is also found in oily foods, including fish and eggs.

In rare cases, some children are born with a genetic form of the disease.

Rickets is referred to as a Victorian-era disease, due to its prominence at the turn of the century.

It has largely disappeared in the Western world, thanks to the rise in Vitamin D enriched foods, including margarine and cereals.

But in recent years, experts have warned of an increasing number of cases in the UK. While still relatively small numbers - 900 cases were diagnosed in 2012 - studies have revealed a high number of people in the UK have low levels of Vitamin D in their blood.

Any child with a lack of Vitamin D in their diet can develop the disease. But the condition is more prevalent in children with dark skin, due to the fact more sunlight is needed to deliver enough Vitamin D. Those born premature and children taking medication that can interfere with Vitamin D are also at a higher risk of developing the disease.

Rickets is easily prevented. A child's hands and face only have to be exposed to sunlight for around 15 minutes several times a week in spring and summer to provide enough of the vital Vitamin. That combined with a healthy diet incorporating Vitamin D and calcium-rich foods help strengthen the bones.

'It is unclear why there was a breakdown in multi- agency working in this respect.

'Evidence suggests, whilst agencies reference that they recognise and understand the role of the local authority designated officer, there is little evidence of engagement.'

It has emerged that staff were partly reassured because the baby’s father worked as a nurse at King’s College Hospital in south-east London.

The couple, strict vegetarians due to their beliefs, had known their son was unwell for two months but chose prayer over medical treatment.

After his death, tests showed Ndingeko had been suffering from rickets – a disease common in Victorian times caused by severe lack of vitamin D and associated with a poor diet and lack of sunlight.

The Zimbabwean-born couple, from Erith, Kent, admitted manslaughter. Nkosiyapha Kunene, 36, was jailed for three years and his 32-year-old wife for two years and three months last Friday.

Barbara Trevanion, independent chair of Bexley Safeguarding Children’s Board, said lessons had been learnt and improvements made.

She said yesterday: 'It was a very unusual case which highlights the importance of vitamin D, particularly given the mother was vegan.

'My health colleagues have already done a lot of work on promoting the importance of this vitamin as a direct result of this case.'

Ms Trevanion added that one of the main problems in the case had been with the balance between family privacy and protection.

She said: 'Everybody has a right to protect their religion but not to the extent that it puts lives at risk.

'People are very respectful of others’ religion and tradition and sometimes that can cloud the rights of the child.

'The father was a nurse as well, which felt like reassurance. However, there had been early indications there was some risk involved.'

Ms Trevanion said Bexley’s Council’s children’s services have come a long way since Ofsted described them as 'inadequate' in a number of key areas in August 2012 – two months after Ndingeko’s death.

She said: 'We are doing our best to implement the report’s recommendations and we have made real improvement in Bexley since the inspection.

'We all do our best to make sure those children are safe and this goes for the community as well.'

A spokesman for Bexley's Local Safeguarding Children's Board told MailOnline: 'This very sad death happened nearly two years ago and involved an extremely complex and unusual set of circumstances.

'The LSCB have conducted a thorough review and we are ensuring that lessons have been learnt.

'A number of improvements have been made in respect of communications between agencies as well as increasing awareness of the importance of vitamin D supplements.

'We agree with the judges summary that whilst it is important to respect religious views of parents this should never divert focus from the welfare of a child.

'Ensuring that we protect Bexley’s vulnerable children and young people is a responsibility that we take very seriously. Ensuring that we do everything possible to safeguard them is our number one priority.'
