Clickety clack, clickety clack. It was the soundtrack to my Fifties childhood, as my mother and grandmother knitted constantly.

Even relaxing in front of the TV, they were never happy unless their hands were occupied.

It’s a trait I inherited, and when my own children were small, I was never happier than when I was ‘creating’ something to swathe them in. But by their teenage years the time came when they didn’t want homemade clothes any more. I suppose wearing something knitted by Mum isn’t cool.

Jenni says she inherited her love of knitting from her mother and grandmother who knitted non-stop

Now Ed and Charlie are 31 and 27 — and it would have taken me months to do anything for them.

So, in the absence of grandchildren, I put away my knitting needles and took up needlepoint.

Then, a couple of months ago, I came across a colourful book of knitting patterns for dogs, by the designer and author Debbie Bliss.

In the absence of grandchildren Jenni has started knitting for her chihuahuas Butch, Madge and Frida

And I just knew my three chihuahuas, Butch, Madge and Frida (yes, they are definite grandchild substitutes), would love something to keep them warm this winter.

Full of excitement, I dug out my yarns and knitting needles again.

Knitting is experiencing a renaissance here — with an estimated seven million knitters clacking away in their homes. And a huge number of knitters will own a dog.

What’s not to love about a pooch in a homemade poncho? asks Jenni

So what’s not to love about a pooch in a homemade poncho?

My two previous pets, William and Mary, miniature schnauzers, had the kind of coats of their own that could be clipped close in the summer and allowed to grow in the winter, so they never noticed the cold.

Chihuahuas, though, are different. Mine are short-haired and, as soon as a winter nip sets in, they regard me as a lunatic when I enthusiastically shout: ‘Walkies!’

Chihuahuas are bred for a Mexican climate rather than the chilly British weather

They hide behind the sofa and emerge reluctantly when I put on my bossy ‘leader of the pack’ voice. I then have to endure their pitiful display of shivering the minute we step out of the door. I’ve even faced scathing comments from fellow dog walkers: ‘Poor little things. Don’t you think they should be wrapped up warm?’

My son, Ed, is a vet, and when I asked his opinion of the growing trend of clothes for dogs and whether I should get some for my three he was scornfully dismissive.

‘If a dog needs a coat it shouldn’t be living in this country. They’re chihuahuas, for goodness sake, bred for the Mexican climate. And they are dogs, Mother. They shouldn’t be treated like pampered, spoilt babies.’

Jenni has lavished love and affection on her pets since her sons Ed and Charlie left home

So my poor little chihuahuas just aren’t built for the chilly British winter. But they do make adorable companions . . . always welcoming, never making demands or expressing disapproval of Mummy — the way children do.

To be honest, I think Ed may be a teensy bit jealous of my canine kids, given the love and affection I’ve lavished upon them since he and his brother flew the nest.

Debbie Bliss told me she was inspired to create a range of patterns for dog wear because every time she went to talk to her editor about knitting books they ended up talking about their dogs. Combining her two greatest passions in life seemed like an inspired idea.

Her pets — Smiffy, the Parsons Jack Russell and Monty, the beagle — seemed happy in the sweaters, and Debbie soon compiled enough doggy patterns for a book.

It’s illustrated with lots of fun photos of dogs in jumpers, including spaniels, bulldogs, collies and Yorkies. The patterns vary in difficulty and can be modified for small, medium and large canines.

The size of my three meant there was no point considering the Aran or the stripey sailor suit, because even the small wouldn’t have been small enough (and I’m not sure my skills are up to stripes just yet).

Nor was I prepared to humiliate them by knitting the funny hats to go with their coats. My guys would have them off in seconds no matter how tight the elastic used to keep such hats in place. So in the end I went for the Puppy Polo (a jumper with a rollneck to you and me).

I excitedly restocked my knitting bag with needles, a stitch holder, row counter, darning needle, tape measure and a strange contraption that helps you knit a rollneck in one piece without seams.

I was surprised how quickly the skills came back. Soon I was casting on like lightning, doing rib and stocking stitch and casting off neatly without any trouble.

Each jumper took the best part of three evenings — time that has turned out to be very well spent.

Jennie's brood - Butch, Madge and Frida in their homemade outfits

Madge happily let me fit hers on and modelled it with her usual panache, prancing about like Kate Moss on speed. I chose hot pink to suit her wild personality.

Butch (who has white fur) looked very smart in black, and for Frida I picked a softer pink because I thought it would complement her grey coat. She didn’t seem to mind, though she looked a bit cross when she realised it was a bit too long at the back and wiggled from side to side when she wagged her tail — which she does a lot.

I told her what my granny always said to me when she’d stayed up all night to finish a sweater for me for school. ‘Don’t worry love, you’ll grow into it.’ (She won’t!)

Jenni thinks carefully about the tones that would suit each of her pet pooch's natural fur colour

This week, on a bit of a chilly day, I took all three to the local park.

They ran about happily and were thrilled to be stopped every few minutes by fellow walkers saying: ‘Oh, don’t they look gorgeous, where did you buy their lovely sweaters?’ I almost burst with pride when I answered: ‘I didn’t, I made them myself.’

This substitute Granny is very, very happy indeed.
