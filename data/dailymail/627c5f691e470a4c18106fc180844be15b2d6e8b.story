Sally Farmiloe has died aged 60 after a long battle with cancer, her agent has confirmed

Former politician Jeffrey Archer has led the tributes to his former mistress Sally Farmiloe after she lost her long battle with cancer.

The 66-year-old actress died peacefully in her sleep on Monday afternoon, surrounded by her family.

After the news was announced, Jeffrey Archer led the tributes to his former mistress, saying he was 'saddened' by her death.

The pair met through the Tory party, for which Farmiloe was a staunch fundraiser, and had an affair for three years until they were exposed in 1999.

Archer told Telegraph diarist Tim Walker, who put the comment on Twitter: 'After Sally’s brave struggle against this terrible 
disease, I was saddened to hear the news of her death'.

The former Howards' Way actress had previously fought a long battle with breast cancer but was told in July last year that it had spread to her liver and bones.

Announcing her death, her family paid tribute to the actress saying she had fought cancer with 'extraordinary courage' and was a 'warm and caring woman'.

Her agent confirmed that Farmiloe had taken 'a turn for the worse' about one month ago and had been bed-bound for many weeks.

She told MailOnline: 'Sally just faded away. She was very weak and she just went to sleep. She was not in pain and she just slipped away.'

Last year, Farmiloe, who lived in Baron's Court, west London, was diagnosed with incurable bone and liver cancer.

The news came just four months after she had finished her course of treatment for breast cancer.

In a statement, her family said: 'It 
is with great sadness and regret that we announce the passing away of 
actress, author and socialite Sally Farmiloe-Neville.

'She passed away peacefully, surrounded by her family, yesterday July 28, after a drawn out battle with cancer.

'She
 fought the illness with extraordinary courage, raising money for cancer
 charities such as Yes to Life, Against Breast Cancer and the Royal 
Marsden's Research Fund along the way.

'She
 chronicled her painful journey with humour and fortitude in her book My
 Left Boob – A Cancer Diary, published by the Book Guild, typically 
giving away all her royalties to the cancer charities.

'She was working on a sequel where she was to share her further battles with bone and liver cancer.

'Sally
 was a warm and caring woman who not only raised her own daughter Jade 
with whom she had a very close relationship until the end, but who also

'She will be remembered not only for her leading role in the TV drama Howards' Way but also as a tireless charity worker.

'Sally is survived by her husband Jeremy, her daughter Jade, her adopted daughter Katherine and her stepson Alistair.

'She will be sadly missed by her family and her many many friends.'

Dr Anna Brocklebank, who had been friends with Farmiloe for more than 20 years, told MailOnline: 'She had the heart of a lion.

Sally Farmiloe will be best remembered for playing Dawn in the BBC 80s drama Howards' Way.

The actress also featured in several films in the 70s and 80s, including Hell To Pay, Dear Rosie, Spanish Fly and Spectre.

She also starred in episodes of TV cult classics such as Steptoe and Son, Bergerac and Casualty.

Later on in her career, she played the celebrity characters in pantomimes, including the Wicked Queen in Snow White and Prince Charming in Cinderella.

She also made several appearances on stage, including in Absent Friends. 

'She was one of the greatest women and one of the most intelligent I have ever met.

'I
 used to get angry with how she would be portrayed but she would just 
laugh it off and say: "That's the business, Darling." She was so 
generous and so intelligent - you've never met anyone like her.

And
 actress Debbie Arnold wrote: 'Devastated at the loss of the beautiful 
Sally Farmiloe. The most inspirational person on the planet . Heaven is 
in for a party.'

Farmiloe, known for her roles in Dear 
Rosie and Howard's Way, as well as her modelling and writing, had been 
diagnosed with breast cancer in May 2012, for which she underwent 
chemotherapy, surgery and radiotherapy.

Since her diagnosis, Farmiloe had spoken openly about her battle with cancer and became an inspiration to others fighting the illness.

At the time of being diagnosed with secondary cancer, she told the Daily Mail: 'I was just devastated. I cried and cried. To start with I thought, 'I'm just going to capitulate now and go out on morphine and Champagne'.

'[But then I thought]  I can't check out when [my daughter Jade is] only 21. She still needs me... I don't know what she'll do without me.

'So I thought, 'I'm going to endure whatever's in store.' I know it won't be easy. It won't be nice. But I'm going to do it. I'm going to fight for my girl... I'm grabbing at life... I don't want Jade to see me in pain.

'So I'm going back on the chemo: seven pills plus the Dom Perignon.'

Farmiloe wrote a book about her 
battle with breast cancer called My Left Boob, the proceeds of which 
went to the Royal Marsden Hospital and Yes To Life! cancer charity.

She was also in the process of writing a sequel about her battle with secondary cancer.

While she was in hospital being treated for breast cancer, doctors 
decided to give a do not resuscitate order, something she nor any member
 of her family authorised. 

After that, Farmiloe also began campaigning for more stringent rules regarding DNR orders.

She had also spent many years organising fundraisers for both the Conservative party and charities.

It
 was through the Tory party that she met Jeffrey Archer, with whom she 
had an affair for three years until they were exposed in 1999.

daughter Jade and her adopted daughter Katherine, who she took in after
