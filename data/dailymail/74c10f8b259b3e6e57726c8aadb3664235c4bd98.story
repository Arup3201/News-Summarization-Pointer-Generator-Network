One of Ed Miliband's key advisers has quit the party - to join the Liberal Democrats.

Phil Taylor helped mastermind Mr Miliband’s victory over his brother David in their battle for the Labour leadership.

But Mr Taylor has lashed out at the 'really weak' Labour leader and defected to Nick Clegg’s party.

He attacked Mr Miliband's policies on the economy, Europe and attempt to look tough on knife crime.

Mr Taylor has also mocked Mr Miliband over recent gaffes - including his now infamous struggle with a bacon sandwich.

Mr Taylor was the Labour leader's speech writer during the leadership contest against his brother David.

According to the Mirror, Mr Taylor even stayed over at Mr Miliband's north London home.

Mr Taylor is a long-term Labour supporter and served as a special adviser to Peter Hain when the veteran Labour MP held a string of Cabinet jobs.

He remained a shadow Cabinet political adviser after leaving Mr Miliband’s office was still on the party payroll until three months ago.

But he has turned against the Labour and joined the Lib Dems a month ago after praising Nick Clegg for taking on UKIP leader Nigel Farage in TV European election debates.

He attacked Labour’s addiction to spending, saying: 'Labour’s view still that absolutely anything with label "capital" slapped on must be so economically beneficial it justifies more borrowing.'  

Mr Taylor also lashed out at Labour's decision to support Tory plans to automatically jail people caught carrying a knife for a second time.

He said: 'No chance Ed M actually believes this nonsense in private, but terrified of ‘soft on crime’ label - really weak.'

Mr Taylor and the Labour party have refused to comment.

The revelation that Mr Taylor has jumped ship comes amid a series of dire polls for the Labour leader.

Mr Miliband was widely ridiculed after unflattering pictures of him eating a bacon sandwich appeared online. One of his former aides Phil Taylor, who has left the party to join the Lib Dems, retweeted a doctored image of the picture on his Twitter account. He also accused him of being 'really weak'

Former Business Secretary Peter Mandelson - a key ally of Tony Blair and Gordon Brown - even refused to endorse him as Labour’s best choice for leader in a TV interview.

The Labour peer said: 'I think that he has confused the party’s message on business.'

Mr Miliband has hit back at the growing criticism of his leadership and vowed to beat the 'historical odds' he faces trying to win the next election just five years after Labour were kicked out of power.

He also insisted he was confident that Labour would emerge from next year's election as the largest party. He said: 'We are in a position to defy those odds.'

Mr Miliband said: 'Millions of people feel that no political party speaks for them. That’s what I’m determined to turn around.'
