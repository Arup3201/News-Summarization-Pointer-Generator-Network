When Leon Gautier landed on Sword Beach in a hail of enemy fire on June 6, 1944 the last thing he expected was that 70 years later one of the 'Boches' he was fighting against would be a friend and neighbour.

Yet today, Mr Gautier, now 91, and Johannes Boerner, 88, live side-by-side in the very town where the French commando came ashore in the first wave of the D-Day invasion.

They are two of the dwindling number of veterans of the Allies' Normandy landings and the ensuing three-month battle to push German forces back on the western front of Nazi-occupied Europe.

Enemies to neighbours: Johannes Boerner, left, 88, and Leon Gautier, right, 91, fought on opposite sides during the Normandy landings in 1944, but they are now friends living in the same town on what was the front line

Time and understanding have forged a bond between the former French elite commando and the German parachutist from Leipzig, who are neighbours in the Normandy town of Ouistreham.

In 2012 they celebrated Christmas together and next month both will attend ceremonies marking the 70th anniversary of D-Day.

'We're like brothers now, it's just great for both of us,' said Mr Boerner, who took French citizenship in 1956 after marrying a Norman woman.

It is one of the vagaries of history that both men live today in the same town where Mr Gautier landed on D-Day, Tommy gun in hand and a year of training under his belt.

He was one of Commander Philippe Kieffer's 177 French soldiers who battled the machine gun fire, landmines and barbed wire of Sword Beach as part of No. 4 British Commando.

Besides the unforgettable sight of the
 armada of boats filling the sea, Mr Gautier recalls checking and 
rechecking his weapons just before landing, and how the photo of his 
wife Dorothea in his pocket got 'a little wet'.

'It was OK, though, I fixed it later,' he said. 'I still have it.'

German
 shells rained down on Mr Gautier and his comrades even before they 
reached land, but months of training and a surge of adrenaline 
outweighed fear of the 'Boches', the derogatory term the French used for
 German soldiers.

'Commander
 Kieffer had told us what would happen to us: "It's possible that not 
even 10 of us will come out alive",' said Mr Gautier.

News of the surprise amphibious attack - along with those by U.S., Canadian and British forces on the now-legendary beaches of Utah, Omaha, Gold and Juno - roused Mr Boerner from his sleep far away in Brittany.

The invasion set him and the rest of the elite 2nd Fallschirmjaeger (parachute) unit on a 220-mile march to Normandy to shore up German defences and try to break the Allied bridgehead.

'The night of the 6th of June we were woken up with an alarm - "The Allied troops are landing in Normandy!",' said Mr Boerner. 'We left for Saint-Lo, but we went on foot - 350 km.'

Mr Gautier and Mr Boerner were never in the same place at the same time in Normandy, but they share memories - the impenetrable hedgerows that snared tanks and hid snipers, hearing the voice of the enemy just feet away, the mosquitoes that infested the flooded valleys, the small green apples that were too sour to eat, and the smell of human corpses rotting in the heat.

Fleeing Saint-Lo on July 17, Mr Boerner and his unit began a series of retreats, finding themselves eventually trapped in the 'Cauldron', the Battle of the Falaise Pocket, where they were encircled by Allied forces.

'The approach to Falaise was horrendous. They were all around us with their tanks, especially their planes, they just didn't let up,' said Boerner.

'There were bodies everywhere ... there were 10,000 dead on the approach to Falaise.'

Hungry, lice-ridden and demoralised, Mr Boerner and his comrades from dispersed German units rifled the pockets of dead soldiers for cigarettes or food.

'We had nothing left. Our uniforms were dirty, in tatters ... How were we going to get out of this?'

On August 21, after days of aerial and artillery bombardment, and unable to escape eastward through a narrow gap the Germans dubbed 'the corridor of death', Mr Boerner was taken prisoner by the Canadians.

He was one of the lucky ones - of his original company of 120 men, only nine survived.

General Dwight Eisenhower later wrote in his memoirs: 'Falaise was one of the greatest killing grounds of the war.

'It was literally possible to walk for hundreds of yards at a time, stepping on nothing but dead and decaying flesh.'

For Mr Boerner, PoW camps and forced farm labour were his life until 1947. with the Leipzig of his youth in ruins and under Soviet control, he decided that his new chapter would find him right where he already was - in Normandy.

Mr Gautier was shipped back to Britain after three months of fighting in Normandy, one of only 25 French commandos to escape death or wounding in the Battle of Normandy.

Deployments in Britain, France and even Cameroon preceded a permanent move home to France for a career as a claims adjuster.

After retirement, he moved to Ouistreham and, while paying a visit to a restaurant in the town, the Chateaubriand, met its owner, Mr Boerner.

A book about the two men, Ennemis Et Fr√®res (Enemies And Brothers) by Jean-Charles Stasi, was published in 2010.

Mr Boerner, his living room decorated with a cuckoo clock and beer steins, still has a full head of hair and the same gentle look that he had in his eye when he was photographed in his Luftwaffe uniform at the start of the war.

'I hope we never see another war like this because it's just not possible ... The young men, the young men on the front there, shooting machine guns, it's just not possible. Freedom and peace, that's all I can tell you.'

Mr Gautier thinks about the flowers that he'll be laying on his fallen comrades' graves next month.

'For the young people - they need to know all about this,' he said. 'It cannot happen again. We have to be vigilant.'
