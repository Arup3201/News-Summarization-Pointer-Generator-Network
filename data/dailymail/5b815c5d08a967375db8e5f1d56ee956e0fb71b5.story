A 19 year old woman has fronted court, accused of supplying the prohibited drug which allegedly killed her best friend.

Rebecca Hannibal from Cammeray in Sydney’s north, is accused of giving an ecstasy pill to her best friend Georgina Bartter in November last year.

Ms Bartter was just 19 when she died after collapsing on the dance floor at Harbourlife Dance Party at Mrs Macquarie’s Chair in Sydney.

Ms Hannibal (left) and Ms Bartter, both 19, were very close friends and had just returned from a five week European holiday together with a group of friends

The university student was rushed to St Vincent's Hospital but died from multiple organ failure.

The coroner's report is yet to be released but it is reported that Ms Bartter died after taking 'one and a half pills' of a drug known as a 'purple speaker'.

Ms Hannibal was arrested in relation to her friend's death in December and made an appearance at court last week. 

Her arrest was allegedly kept quiet so police could continue their investigations in the hope of making further arrests, according to Sydney Morning Herald. 

'A 19-year-old Cammeray woman was charged on 23rd December 2014 with supplying a prohibited drug,' NSW Police confirmed to Daily Mail Australia. 

'She appeared at Downing Centre Local Court on 4th February 2015. 

'There she was bailed prior to reappearing at that same court on 18th March.' 

Ms Hannibal reportedly also plead not guilty to one charge of drug supply during her court appearance, according to Sydney Morning Herald.

Tragically, the two young women shared a very close bond. They were 'best friends' and had travelled to Europe for five weeks together just months before Ms Bartter's death. 

Facebook is filled with photos of them together, with the teens pictured celebrating and carefree at Ms Hannibal's 18th. They pose for photos with wide grins and silly faces. 

Ms Bartter, as one of her closest friends, gave a speech that night about her long-time friend. 

A day at Harbourlife Festival was intended to be just another fun day for the two friends before it went horribly wrong. 

Detectives from Sydney City Local Area Command established Strike Force Oibell to investigate the supply of prohibited drugs in Sydney. 

Two people have now been charged in relation to the death of Georgina Bartter, after police arrested the man accused of selling the drugs to Ms Hannibal on Saturday. 

Police will allege that Ms Hannibal bought the drugs from Matthew Forti, also 19 in the days leading up to the festival.  

The 19-year-old man was finally arrested at Willoughby in north Sydney on February 7, following months of police investigations. 

More than 5,000 people had attended the dance party where police arrested 78 people for drug offences.

Following extensive investigations, police alleged that the man had in his possession an amount of prohibited drugs during a search.

The 19-year-old woman was at Harbourlife festival at Mrs Macquarie's Chair near Sydney Botanical Gardens

Bartter later died after reportedly taking 'one and a half pills' of the drug known as purple speaker

Hundreds attended her funeral service St Mary's Catholic Church in North Sydney a week after her death

Detectives executed a search warrant at a home on Robert Street, where they located and seized further drugs. The drugs have been seized and will undergo forensic examinations.

The man was was taken to Chatswood Police Station where he was received three charges of supplying prohibited drugs, as well as charge for a possessing prohibited drug.

He was granted conditional bail to appear at Downing Centre Local Court on March 25.

Investigations by Strike Force Oibell continue.
