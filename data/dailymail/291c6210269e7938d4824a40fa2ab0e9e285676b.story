A Little Italy bakery is accused of selling knockoff cronuts -- the croissant-doughtnut hybrid treat which has taken New York City by storm.

City Éclair, a bakery on Hester Street, has a sign advertising the tasty treat that says 'New! Cronut $2,' according to The New York Post.

A woman advertising the cronuts said 'Customers say they taste the same, and they are only $2,' the paper reports.

The cronut, however, was trademarked by Dominique Ansel in January 2014, who created it.

The cronut was first sold at Dominique Ansel Bakery on Spring Street in May 2013, the paper reports. It quickly gained a cult following -- fans can expect to wait hours in line to get their hands on cronuts.

A spokeswoman for Ansel said they would seek legal action against City Éclair.

'We will pursue every single case of infringement,' she told the Post. 'It’s something the legal team is very adamant about.'

Ansel, in an interview with The Guardian in February, said trademarking the cronut was a 'very important decision.'

'As a chef, you don’t really know if you need to do this,' Ansel said.  'We really quickly realized that a lot of small business owners are just bullied by [bigger companies]. If you don’t protect your trademark, they will try to register the name before you do and they will stop you from using your creation.'
