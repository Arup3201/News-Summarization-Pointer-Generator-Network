Arjen Robben wants to finish his career with Bayern Munich, quashing speculation of the Dutchman linking up with former boss Louis van Gaal at Manchester United.

Van Gaal brought the 30-year-old to Munich in the summer of 2009 during his time as Bayern boss, but the winger confirmed he will not be rejoining him at Old Trafford.

'I am 30 now, it is not like I want to go to a new league,' Robben told the Telegraph. 'I have been in England, I have been in Spain, so I don't have that desire, but that is all to do with the club I am with now.'

He added: 'I am 100 per cent convinced I will stay here for a very long time.' 

Robben committed his future to Bayern in March, signing a contract to keep him at the Allianz Arena until 2017. 

He became a superstar during his time at Chelsea under the management of Jose Mourinho - and he insists he has no regrets about the path he has taken in his career.

'I made the right decision, to work with a great manager like Mourinho, and I made a big step there, developed myself as a player and won two leagues in three years, two League Cups and an FA Cup.'  

The Dutchman insists he will have a close eye on the match  at Old Trafford on Sunday, but his focus will be on the duel between Mourinho and Van Gaal.
