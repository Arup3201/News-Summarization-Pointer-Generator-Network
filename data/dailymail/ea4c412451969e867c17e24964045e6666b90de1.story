Two taxpayer-funded New York defense attorneys have sparked outrage after appearing in an online rap video that urges black people to kill police officers - and allowing it to be filmed in their offices.

The video, dubbed 'Hands Up', shows black men holding guns to the head of a white actor dressed as an NYPD cop, and features the lyric: 'For Mike Brown and Sean Bell, a cop got to get killed'.

It also depicts a grief-stricken mother walking into The Bronx Defenders's offices on 161st Street, where she is comforted by an attorney. Another lawyer at the firm features later in the footage.

Shortly after the video was posted online in December last year, it was brought to the attention of police and City officials. They launched an investigation into the attorneys' roles in the footage.

Under fire: The video, dubbed 'Hands Up', also depicts a grieving mother walking into The Bronx Defenders office on 161st Street, where she is comforted by an attorney(pictured), either Kumar Rao and Ryan Napoli

Law firm: In a report, the Department of Investigation (DOI) said it had found the two lawyers had knowingly 'participated in the video' and allowed The Bronx Defenders's offices (pictured) to be used in the footage

In a report, the DOI said it had found  the lawyers - Kumar Rao and Ryan Napoli - had knowingly 'participated in the video and allowed the organization's offices to be used' in the footage.

This is despite the taxpayer-funded professionals 'knowing that it advocated the killing of police officers, the document, published on Thursday following the month-long investigation, stated.

Meanwhile, The Bronx Defenders' executive director, Robin Steinberg, was found to have 'failed to discipline the staff after learning of their conduct' and lied to City officials during the inquiry.

On Thursday, Mayor Bill de Blasio described the department's findings as 'deeply disturbing'.

In a statement, obtained by the New York Post, de Blasio said: 'Any endorsement of violence against police officers is completely unacceptable and will absolutely not be tolerated.'

Rappers: The video, which features black rappers Uncle Murda (right) and Maino (left), also includes the racially charged lyrics: 'Time to start killing these coppers' and 'By any means necessary, let's make them respect us'

He added: 'We rely on entities like The Bronx Defenders to play an essential role in the criminal justice system by safeguarding the rights of indigent clients. The Administration has demanded Bronx Defenders take immediate action in response to the findings of DOI.'

Mark Peters, the departments commissioner, also condemned the attorneys' decision to participate in the video and 'advocate the killing' of cops, describing it as 'unacceptable and offensive'.

In the report, he wrote: 'These attorneys have abysmally failed to meet their obligations to their clients, to the courts and to the city as a whole.'

The Bronx Defenders - which is known for its aggressive defense of low-income and minority clients in the New York region - has amassed around $107million in city funding since 2007.

Accused: The video includes lyrics relating to Michael Brown (left), who was shot dead by a white police officer in August last year.

Shockingly, the organization's logo and details appear in a banner ad at the end of the rap video.

The footage, which features black rappers Uncle Murda and Maino, also includes the lyrics: 'Time to start killing these coppers' and 'By any means necessary, let's make them respect us'.

It features scenes of police brutality and clips from the 'chokehold' death of Eric Garner, a 43-year-old father who passed away after being arrested by a white police officer on Staten Island.

'This video goes well beyond the parameters for protected speech and constitutes a serious threat to the lives of police officers,' Patrolmen’s Benevolent Association president Patrick Lynch said. 

'Hands up!': In a statement, the Bronx Defenders said it was not aware the final video would include images of police officers with guns held to their heads. Above, black men are seen holding their hands up in the video

'It is clear that Bronx Defenders who knowingly participated in this despicable video... have violated their oath as officers of the court and should be disbarred as a result.'

In a statement, The Bronx Defenders said it was not aware the final video would include images of police officers with guns held to their heads, saying it is committed to 'preserving life for all people'.

It added that it has asked for the footage to be taken down.

However, the DOI inquiry concluded that Rao and Napoli exhibited a 'profound lack of judgment' and 'serious misconduct' in participating in the video, while Steinberg committed 'gross mismanagement'.

City officials have reportedly demanded that action be taken against the lawyers by February 4.
