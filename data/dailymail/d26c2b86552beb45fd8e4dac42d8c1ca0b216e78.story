The man who secretly filmed Mitt Romney's damning remarks about 'the 47 per cent' in the run-up to the presidential election is finally coming forward today.

The film-maker, whose tape caused Romney's campaign to falter and in part cost him the White House, has been revealed as a bartender working at the dinner for wealthy Republican donors.

He admitted that the only reason he had a camera with him at the fundraiser last May in Boca Raton, Florida was because he assumed Romney would meet staff and allow photos as a thank you - which the candidate did not.

Game-changer: Former presidential candidate Mitt Romney's remarks about the '47 per cent' sank his hopes for the White House after a secretly-filmed tape was released online

In the video, which surfaced online last September, Romney argues that '47 per cent' of Americans would vote for Obama 'no matter what' because they were 'victims dependent on government'.

Romney said: 'All right, there are 47 per cent who are with him, who are dependent upon government, who believe that they are victims, who believe that government has a responsibility to care for them, who believe that they are entitled to health care, to food, to housing, to you name it.

'That that's an entitlement. And the government should give it to them. And they will vote for this president no matter what.'

The bartender said he felt it was his 'civic duty' to make the tape public and is now allowing his identity to be revealed on Wednesday night on MSNBC.

The much-anticipated interview will 
take place on the Ed Show and as host Ed Schultz said: 'No matter what 
Mitt Romney does for the rest of his life, he will probably be best 
remembered for this.'

Leaked: James Carter, an opposition researcher, said he found the video online and put reporters from the left-leaning U.S. website Mother Jones in touch with an unnamed individual who had shot the footage

Woops! The resulting outcry over Romney's remarks is still regarded as one of the main reasons why the Republican lost the race to the White House

The 
man who made the tape has so far remained hidden. All that is known is he works with a prestigious Florida catering 
company who take cater of high-end events.

Connected: James Carter, grandson of former president Jimmy Carter, made sure the Romney tape received widespread attention

The catering worker told New York Magazine that he had worked another political fundraiser at the same hotel where Bill Clinton was a speaker.

After the retired president made his remarks, he came into the kitchen and thanked the waiting staff, posing for pictures and signing autographs.

Romney, on the other hand, did not speak to staff and despite telling his high-paying guests that the dinner was off the record - he did not address waiters, bartenders and busboys at all.  

The only name which has been publicly connected with the Romney tape so far is political researcher James Carter - grandson of former Democratic president Jimmy Carter.

He said that he found the video online and put reporters from the left-leaning U.S. website Mother Jones in touch with the individual who  shot the footage.

At the time, the disclosure that he was involved fueled speculation the project to embarrass Romney was part of a liberal stitch-up.

Mr Carter has publicly spoken about his involvement but protected his source.
