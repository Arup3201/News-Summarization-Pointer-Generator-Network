Two Algerian men and two Czech women have been imprisoned for sham marriages - but the men fled half way through the trial and have not been seen since. 

Zdenka Sudikova, 22, wed Mahrez Benbetka, 28, and then Katerina Gaborova, 28, married Fateh El Fiad, 38, for the men to gain the rights of EU citizens.

At court, it was revealed there was no communication, interaction or affection among the couples.

Gaborova married failed asylum seeker Fateh El Fiad, 38, (pictured outside the Middlesbrough register office) six days after Sudikova married Benbetka, an overstayer on a six-month visa

The two men were jailed for 18 months each - but they were not at Teesside Crown Court today to hear the sentence as they absconded halfway through their trial. If caught, they will face automatic deportation.

The women were jailed for one year each. 

Sentencing the four, who all lived in Middlesbrough, Recorder Henry Prosser said: 'I am satisfied this was a commercial enterprise.

'There was no love or affection between the parties to the marriage.

'They were strangers to each other at the time of the marriage and I'm satisfied that the marriages were entered into for the purposes of financial gain, both to enable the men to obtain work in this country and to remain here indefinitely.

'I am satisfied that there was a significant degree of organisation that went into the commission of these offences.' 

He told Teesside Crown Court the four were in contact with a network allowing non-EU citizens to pay for sham marriages with EU citizens.

Jailing the women, Recorder Prosser said: 'I am satisfied that each of them would have expected to be paid for taking part in this marriage.' 

Prosecutor David Brooke told how the Middlesbrough Register Office registrar had no legal right to stop the nuptials, but reported concerns over the validity of both marriages.

It was suspected the couples had been 'coached' as there was no affection between them.   

Each of the women said they had met their partners in a coffee shop months earlier.

Gaborova paid for Sudikova, a bakery worker, to fly from Prague in May 2013 for the fake marriage.

Sudikova then married Benbetka, an overstayer on a six-month visa, on September 24, 2013.

She told investigators Benbetka proposed unexpectedly. She knew he was an illegal immigrant but was happy about the marriage.

In text messages, they asked questions about each other's families to prepare for discussions with the registrar.

Gaborova and failed asylum seeker El Fiad,  got married six days after Sudikova and Benbetka on September 30.

Gaborova lived with her partner - another man - and their two children. She told investigators she was going to marry behind his back. 

The bride was photographed in her wedding dress outside Middlesbrough register office, in front of the courthouse where she was later convicted. 

Suspicions arose as El Fiad did not appear to know his fiancée's full name. 

Both marriages went ahead despite arrests and interviews by immigration officials weeks earlier.

And the men both applied for residence following their marriages in September 2013. 

The four all denied the charges and were convicted in two trials. 

The two men disappeared in the middle of the first trial in October last year, and have still not been found.

They were convicted in their absence of obtaining leave to enter or remain in the UK by deception.

The women were found guilty of assisting unlawful immigration to an EU state. 

Barristers for two missing men said their motivation was simply to enable them to work.

Nigel Soppitt, for the two women who still maintain their innocence, said they were wrongly influenced or guided by others

He said: 'They took a great risk for scant reward. These are two young women who have been very foolish.

'They may have been tempted by some easy money by somebody else and they've fallen into that temptation not thinking of the consequences.

'These two young ladies are well down the pecking order, the bottom rung or thereabouts.' 

He added Gaborova had worked long hours tirelessly since coming to the UK and a prison sentence would profoundly affect her children, one of whom has a kidney disorder.

He said a deportation order for the women would be ineffective since, as EU citizens, they could return to the UK at any time.

Mr Soppitt asked the judge to consider suspended sentences, but Recorder Prosser refused arguing that prison was the way to deter others.
