Sexual assault: William Coleman, 53, had been charged with failing to register as a sex offender

A father who went on a seven-year hunger strike in the US to protest his rape conviction has been deported to Britain against his will.

Former football coach William Coleman, 53, originally from Bootle, Liverpool, had been charged in 2012 with failing to register as a sex offender after finishing an eight-year prison sentence for sexually assaulting his wife.

But the charge of failing to register has now been dropped. His lawyer Erin O'Neil-Baker said he had not eaten solid food since 2007, claiming prison officials had force-fed him through a nose tube under court orders since 2008.

Federal immigration authorities took custody of Coleman late on Monday and put him on a plane to England the next day, Ms O'Neil-Baker said.

This action was taken under a 2011 federal judge's deportation order issued because of the felony sexual assault conviction.

Coleman arrived at London Gatwick Airport early yesterday and was expected to be freed.

But he may have to register as a sex offender in England - and it was not immediately clear if he would agree to that, because he continues to maintain his innocence.

U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (Ice) released a statement yesterday saying Coleman was sent to England after he lost a lengthy appeals process involving the deportation order.

Immigration officials did not release information on the timing of the deportation or respond to questions raised by Ms O'Neil-Baker.

‘The arrest and removal of aliens who pose a threat to public safety remains one of Ice’s top priorities,’ the statement said.

‘Ice works closely with prosecutors at all levels, including in this case, to ensure that immigration enforcement actions do not interfere with the adjudication of criminal charges.’

Ms O'Neil-Baker said she and other lawyers for Coleman were upset and stunned that immigration officials did not notify them of the deportation.

She filed a motion for a stay of the deportation on Tuesday afternoon, but by then it was too late, she said.

She said the way the deportation was carried out was unusual, appeared to violate protocol and may have violated Coleman's rights.

Although Coleman lost appeals of his conviction and deportation order, he still wanted to stay to try to clear his name, Ms O'Neil-Baker said.

‘He was willing to die for that principal,’ she said, adding that Coleman's two children live in Connecticut with his ex-wife. ‘He had that ripped away from him in the middle of the night.’
