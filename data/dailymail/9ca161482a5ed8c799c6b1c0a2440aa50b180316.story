An armoury of 13 giant pumps used to stop low-lying Holland from being overwhelmed by the North Sea has been shipped in to help stricken communities submerged on the Somerset Levels.

The machinery is being used to divert water from the River Tone and River Parrett, which burst their banks and left homes and businesses under water since Christmas.

Eight of the pumps were installed at Dunball and five at Beerwall, near Bridgwater, and they can shift more than seven million tons of water every day - enough to fill Wembley Stadium to the brim seven times.

It came as forecasters warned that almost two weeks' rain is expected to fall in parts of Britain by the end of today.

Protection: 13 pumps used to protect Holland from flooding have been brought in to help drain submerged parts of the Somerset Levels

Powerful: This machinery at Dunball, near Bridgwater in Somerset is helping shift seven million tons of water a day from rivers and fields

Teeming: The water is being moved to alleviate stress on the swollen River Tone and River Parrett, whose high levels has caused chaos and misery in the South West

Process: The 13 pumps are being used to reduce levels in the Bridgwater area of Somerset.Â  The eight pumps at Dunball have been pulling water out of the King Sedgemoor Drain - where it meets the River Parrett, left.

Pockets of northern England, Wales and Scotland can expect up to 40mm of rain today - with isolated patches of moorland high above sea level expected to get up to 80mm of rain during that time.

The average rainfall for much of the country during February stands at just less than 100mm, meaning the overnight downpour will represent almost half that total in just a few hours.

But it is not expected to compare with the sorts of rainfall which have caused havoc in parts of southern England in the last two months, where homes have been evacuated and transport networks brought to their knees as flood water surged.

Met Office forecaster Krista Mitchell said a band of rain was heading over England, Wales and Scotland but would fragment by lunchtime today.

'The heaviest rainfall will be over the highest ground. People can expect 30-40mm - up to 80mm on higher ground - the average being 98mm for the month of February.'

To alleviate flooding in Somerset the pumps are moving water from swollen rivers, to trenches or other waterways with much lower levels.

All the pumps are designed to speed up the flow of water.

The eight pumps at Dunball have been pulling water out of the King Sedgemoor Drain - where it meets the River Parrett north of Bridgwater - for around a week.

This is designed to increase the capacity of both the King Sedgemoore Drain and the River Parrett.

The five pumps at Aller are shifting water from the Parrett into the reduced River Sowy lowering water levels where the Parrett and River Tone meet.

The Monks Leaze Clyce sluice gate - north west of Langport - has been opened gradually since Saturday.

It is hoped this will divert water away from the Parrett and into the newly-reduced Rover Sowy and out to the sea.

Relief: Eight of the pumps have been installed at Dunball and five are at Beerwall, near Bridgwater

Cascade of water: The pumps are moving millions of tons daily but experts believe that the Somerset floods will take several more months to dissipate

Powerful: The phenomenal pumping effort is finally reducing flooding on the drenched Somerset Levels - thanks to a helping hand from Holland

Forecast: The Met Office has said that a fortnight's rain could fall in the coming 24 hours before more sunshine and showers on Thursday

The forecaster said there would be some showers heading into the week, with strong winds, but would not compare with the conditions earlier in February.

National Farmers Union president Peter Kendall called for greater priority to be put on flood defences to protect agricultural land.

Flood risk: The Environment AGency has reduced the number of areas where flooding is posing a risk to life but large areas are still under water

Speaking to BBC Radio 4's Today programme at the opening of the NFU's national conference in Birmingham, Mr Kendall said: 'We have to put lives and human safety first, but we have to put a higher priority on agricultural land as well.

'We have turned our waterways into wildlife habitats and we have stopped clearing them. For people to say that a fallen tree is a way of managing water is ludicrous.

'We have to look at the example of Holland, where dykes have been maintained, they dredge, and they protect two-thirds of their country. We have to put a higher value on it, because 58% of our very best agricultural land lies underneath a five-metre contour, and that's what's going to feed our country in the future.'

He added: 'For those farmers who are under water it's been devastating, and particularly for those farmers in Somerset who've now had these back-to-back years of losing all their income, it will be devastating.'

However, Mr Kendall painted a positive picture of the health of farming outside the flooded areas, saying its contribution to the UK economy had grown by 54 per cent over the past five years.

'It is not a big area of the UK that's inundated with water. Our wheat plantings will be up, because 2012 and 2013 saw poor harvests, and actually dairy prices are on the way up as well. So despite the floods, which for the farmers affected are devastating, generally the health of British agriculture is pretty positive,' said Mr Kendall.

'I know we are small - less than 1 per cent of GDP - but if you take a 54 per cent increase, that's significant and the more other parts of the economy that can grow like that, we will all be smiling.

'We believe agriculture produces the raw materials for the biggest manufacturing sector of the economy and we don't believe government really understands the food economy is to the wider economy.'

Mr Rooke told the Today programme: 'We've still got a massive amount of water in Somerset that we are still pumping out in the largest pumping operation that we've ever undertaken. We've still got homes flooded from groundwater. And we are still repairing defences as fast as we can.'

Asked how soon dredging will begin in Somerset, he said: 'We announced last week that we've let a contract to start dredging, the Government has provided the money, so we are keen to get going and we will be looking to do the work as soon as it's safe to do so.'

Mr Rooke was questioned about whether the UK should follow the Netherlands in adopting techniques such as amphibious homes, building homes on stilts and flooding some areas of land to protect others.

He replied: 'I think we will need to consider all of those. There are a few examples in the UK of homes on stilts, but they are very isolated.

'What we need to do is learn from across the world, and indeed the world learns from our experiences, particularly in terms of the flood mapping we do and the flood warning systems we have in place.

'We certainly need to be managing the environment as a whole and looking at how we can cope with these extremes of weather, and I think 2012 was a really good example where for 25 per cent of the year the Environment Agency was busy with others managing a drought and for the rest of the year it was busy, with others, managing serious flooding.'

Drying out: The waters which covered Worcestershire Cricket Club's ground had finally receded today

Recovery: The pristine pitch at the New Road Stadium had been covered in flood water

Damage: Luckily for the Worcestershire CCC authorities there is still the best part of four months until the start of the season but the volume of water will have had lasting effects

Home and dry: The water has now subsided, after levels reached such heights that some of the seats were submerged

Clear up duty: Steve Gravenall, one of the ground staff, washes the floor down in the club's machine shed

Scene: Less than a fortnight ago the ground was submerged after the River Severn, which runs close to the club burst its banks

Soaked: Torrential storms and unceasing rain provided an arena better suited to hosting a sailing championships rather than county cricket games
