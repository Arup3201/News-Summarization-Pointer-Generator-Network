Home to the smallest cathedral in Britain, the North Wales town of  St Asaph had been an ecclesiastical city for almost 1,500 years.

Yesterday it became a city for real following a Royal announcement.

Together with Perth in Scotland and Chelmsford in Essex, St Asaph was awarded city status to mark the Diamond Jubilee.

The newly classed city of St Asaph has a population of around 3,400 - a fifteenth of the size of fellow new city Perth

The trio beat off 22 others to be granted the accolade.

While many of its rivals spent thousands on their campaigns, councillors in St Asaph – population 3,400 – splashed out just £300 on their application.

Bookmakers were so convinced it would not win that, just a couple of weeks ago, they were offering odds of 33-1 against it securing the title.

Yesterday councillor Denise Hodgkinson, who helped devise the bid, said: ‘I was shocked but delighted when I heard the news – I just stood in my kitchen and cried. This is the third time we have applied for city status, so it was third time lucky. I’ve never put a bet on in my life – I wish I had done now.’

St Asaph may not be well known but one of its most famous sons is record Liverpool and Wales goalscorer Ian Rush.

Other notable former residents include:

To outsiders, St Asaph appears like a place that time forgot, with a high street barely wide enough for two cars to pass and no big chain stores or supermarkets.

There is a cattle market every Thursday and, unlike the residents of other cities, locals still know their beat bobby by name.

The city’s football team – St Asaph FC – play in the Vale of Clwyd and Conwy Premier League. Their ground, Roe Plas Meadows, is where the council uses a committee room to stage its monthly meetings.

Neil Shaw, 47, has worked in the butcher’s shop since he was 12 when he was employed to deliver meat by bicycle. He said: ‘It’s great news for St Asaph. We were all brought up to believe we were a city, but now we are one for real.’ Although small, St Asaph has several claims to fame. Explorer and journalist Henry Morton Stanley – who is said to have uttered the immortal words ‘Dr Livingstone, I presume’ – spent his childhood years in its workhouse before moving to America.

Other famous former residents include ex-Liverpool footballer Ian Rush and pop singer Lisa Scott-Lee from Steps.

Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg said the three former towns had won from an ‘exceptional’ field of entrants, which included Bolton, Doncaster and Reading.

The awards were made by the Queen on the advice of Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg, following a competition to bid for civic honours launched in December 2010

‘I have been moved by the pride and passion which people have shown in putting their nominations forward,’ he said.

There are currently 66 cities in the UK. City status is rarely granted, with only 14 new cities created during the 20th century.

St Asaph is not the smallest city in Britain. That accolade belongs to St Davids in Pembrokeshire, West Wales – population 1,700.

Happy in Chelmsford

Essex has never had a city before... so Chelmsford must be chuffed after finally getting the status it has fought for over 25 years.

The leader of the Conservative-run council in Chelmsford, Roy Whitehead, said it was a great honour.

'The city of Chelmsford sounds a lot 
better than the town of Chelmsford, so if we're going to get investment,
we'll be better off as a city,' he told the BBC.

To mark the Queen's Diamond Jubilee, Chelmsford in Essex has been awarded city status

'I am delighted that after almost 25 years of trying, the town of Chelmsford has been honoured by Her Majesty The Queen.

'It has always surprised me that Essex does not have a city within its boundaries. It is a tremendous honour for the town and will bring considerable joy to the local community.'

Civic leaders in Medway in Kent were
magnanimous in defeat.

Medway Council leader Rodney Chambers
said their losing bid showed the area has come a long way since the 1980s.

'I would like to congratulate the three
towns that have today gained city status,' he said.

'While we were, of course, hoping Medway
would gain city status, we believe the bid created a huge amount of national
publicity and this has helped raise our profile and show people how much this
area has to offer.'

He added: 'The Medway of today is a
thriving area, with a large population and regeneration continuing apace.

'We know Medway's journey continues, but
it is definitely heading in the right direction.'

'Perth has had its dignity restored'

The Provost of Perth today claimed that city status had 'restored its dignity'.

Perth Provost Dr John Hulbert said the
success opened a 'glorious new chapter' for Perth, after the ancient Scottish
capital was stripped of its city status in 1975 as part of a local government
shake-up. 

Perth, which celebrated its 800th
anniversary last year, was an 'ecclesiastical city' because it had a cathedral
but was legally considered a town.

Perth has today become classed as a city, opening a 'glorious new chapter'

Dr Hulbert said: 'I am delighted that
official city status has been restored to Perth. Everyone in the council shares
my excitement at the prospect of a glorious new chapter in Perth's long
history.

'The City and Royal Burgh of Perth was
the capital of Scotland from the 9th century until 1437, and then officially
the Second City of Scotland until 1975.

'Even though city status was summarily
removed when local government was reorganised, Perth has continued to be known
as the "Fair City". Full restoration of its ancient dignity is long overdue.

'This decision reflects the fact that
Perth is at the forefront of Scottish life: a modern, dynamic, international
city, offering unrivalled business, artistic, educational, cultural and
sporting opportunities to its citizens and visitors.

'It is located at the hub of Scotland's
transport network, at the gateway to the Highlands, and in the midst of
remarkable scenery. 

'Perth has many royal connections, and
is the home of the Black Watch, the Army's most famous infantry battalion.

'It is the home of home-grown
multi-national firms such as Scottish & Southern Electricity and
Stagecoach, and is an important centre for Aviva and Famous Grouse. 

'It is a city that I am proud to serve.'

Dr Hulbert thanked those who had
supported the campaign, including the leaders of all the political parties in
Scotland and the Lord Provosts and Provosts of the six existing cities of
Scotland, Aberdeen, Dundee, Edinburgh, Glasgow, Inverness and Stirling. 

Councillor Ian Miller, Leader of the SNP
Group on Perth & Kinross Council, said city status would have 'significant
and lasting benefits' for the economy across Perth and Kinross, particularly
through membership of the Scottish Government's now 'Seven Cities Alliance',
which grants access to seed-corn funding for inter-city region project
development.

Cllr Alexander Stewart, leader of the
Conservative Group, added: 'Many people believe that Perth is already a city
but back in 1975 Perth was stripped of the right to be called a city.

'Today,
that wrong has been righted and Perth has been given back the status it rightly
deserves, and that status will open the door to so many opportunities in the
future.'

Perth and Kinross Council launched a
claim for formal city status in 2005 after a search of its archives uncovered
the 'Golden Charter' of 1600 to back its claim.
