A super-fit father-of-four was diagnosed with breast cancer after feeling a lump in his chest while at the gym.

Phil Clarke, 50, was shocked to be diagnosed with the disease which is more than 130 times more common in women than men.

Mr Clarke was drying off after his workout when he discovered a lump on his right nipple.

He went to his doctor and was diagnosed with breast cancer – a disease which affects just one in every 100,000 men and only occurs in about 350 men a year in the UK.

Mr Clarke said: ‘Men aren’t taught to examine their breasts like women do - it was by complete chance that I found the lump.

‘Having breast cancer was shocking because of the stigma - some men have macho images and only associate breast cancer with women.

‘But I was a keep fit fanatic with a healthy diet and I didn’t smoke but I still got breast cancer. It really can affect anyone.’

Mr Clarke discovered the ‘hard ridge’ in his nipple after showering at his local gym in Cardiff, where he spends nine hours a week working out.

The council worker was told that breast cancer is very rare in men - but he went for a mammogram to put his mind at ease.

Mr Clarke says he was shocked to learn that he had the disease as he is very fit and has a healthy diet

Only about 350 men a year are diagnosed with breast cancer in the UK - around one in every 100,000

The test found cancer which Mr Clarke claims may have been caused by a faulty gene passed down by his mother, Patricia, who had breast cancer 18 years earlier.

Mr Clarke said: ‘I didn’t realise breast cancer could be passed down to men, but it can.

‘I could have ignored it but something in the back of my mind told me to get it checked out and I am so glad I did.’

Mr Clarke had an operation to remove his nipple to get rid of the tumour and is now recovering supported by wife, Jayne, and children Louise, 30, Daryl, 27, and twins Phillip and Sophie, 25.

Mr Clarke, who will have to take drug tamoxifen for five years and have regular check-ups, is now trying to raise awareness of male breast cancer.

Mr Clarke believes his breast cancer was caused by a faulty gene that he inherited from his mother who also suffered from the disease

Mr Clarke now has to go for regular check-ups and will have to take the drug tamoxifen for five years

He said: ‘I now want to help more men to become aware and not to be afraid or embarrassed to seek treatment - it could save their life.

‘I kept calm but of course I was afraid. I did have some very dark days and in my head I was planning my own funeral.

‘I know I am very lucky to be alive and I appreciate every single day.’

Mr Clarke is set to take part in a charity fashion show for Breast Cancer Care Cymru and will share the catwalk with 23 women who have all been affected by breast cancer.

Breast cancer affects about one in every 100,000 men in the UK.

About 350 men are diagnosed with the disease each year in the UK.

The cancer develops in the small amount of breast tissue men have behind their nipples.

The most common symptom is a hard, painless lump in one of the breasts.

The disease can also cause the nipple to turn in on itself or to give off discharge.

The cancer is more common in men who are over the age of 60, who have a family history of the disease and who are obese.

Treatment usually involves surgery to remove the tumour and then a course of tamoxifen - a drug that blocks the effects of hormones on breast tissue.

The outlook for men with breast cancer is not as good as for women with the disease as reduced awareness means it tends to be diagnosed later.
