The father of the gunman in the Sandy Hook Elementary School killings has met with a Connecticut official and agreed to help find missing school and medical records that could shed more light on the tragedy.

Peter Lanza met for about an hour on Thursday with the leader of a state panel that is investigating the massacre of 20 first-graders and six educators in Newtown in December 2012 by Lanza's son, Adam.

Hamden Mayor Scott Jackson, chairman of the Sandy Hook Advisory Commission, said that he met with Lanza in Stamford. The commission is meeting on Friday.

A spokesman for Peter Lanza said he had no comment.

Commission members have said that they need more information about Adam Lanza's mental state before making recommendations to change mental health policy.

Hamden Mayor Scott Jackson told the Connecticut Post that the meeting in an undisclosed Stamford location was 'cordial, business-like and friendly'.

He said that Mr Lanza wants as much information as possible to be made public such as his son's school, medical and psychological records.

Peter Lanza, a General Electric executive, was divorced from Adam's mother Nancy Lanza at the time of the massacre last year.

Nancy Lanza was shot four times in the head by her son on December 14. The rifle used to kill her was found by police next to her bed.

Lanza then went to the Sandy Hook Elementary school where he shot dead 20 first-graders and six educators before shooting himself.

Late last month, Connecticut state police released their final report on the shooting 
investigation - amounting to thousands of pages of reports, crime scene 
photographs of the school and Lanza home as well 911 calls and chilling 
video.

The report also 
revealed the extent of Lanza's medical illness with several witnesses 
speaking of an early fascination with destruction and violence.
