Thoroughly brushing its teeth before indulging in a sleepy yawn, these pictures of a bleary eyed orangutan bear an uncanny resemblance to the morning routines of many human beings.

Siswi was captured demonstrating impeccable oral hygiene in Tanjung Puting National Park in Borneo, Indonesia.

The 34-year-old female likes to remain minty fresh by using a toothbrush to scrub its impressive set of teeth, and is regularly spotted sporting a mouthful of foam at the Camp Leakey wildlife refuge.

German photographer Jurgen Freund, 53, visited the national park while on a trip to observe the rainforest and its inhabitants in Indonesia.

'I thought these primates were so much like us,' he said.

'They are so intelligent and so observant of human behaviour.

'We saw Siswi brushing her teeth with a toothbrush and the toothpaste made her yawn,' he said.

Mr Freund, who said orangutans live semi-wild in the jungles of Central Kalimantan in Indonesia, said the creatures learn to mimic the mannerisms of tourists that flock to the region to catch a glimpse of the mighty apes.

'Tourists visit these remote places in river boats and as much as we ogle at them, they learn and imitate our behaviours in the most uncanny manner,' he said.
