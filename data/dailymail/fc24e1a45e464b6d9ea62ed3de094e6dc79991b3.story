Russian embassy staff and their families fled Libya today after 60 gunmen descended on the headquarters.

The attackers were planning to sabotage the Russian diplomatic mission following the murder of a Libyan officer by a Russian woman in Tripoli.

But the botched attempt yesterday was foiled when embassy security guards opened fire.

Staff took refuge in safe rooms during the attack until Libya's foreign minister Mohammed Abdelaziz advised it was no longer safe.

Arriving at the scene, he told the Russian ambassador that the country was 'not in a state to guarantee the security of the Russian embassy and recommended his employees leave the diplomatic mission,' a statement read.

Eventually employees and their relatives were evacuated to Tunisia today. They are expected to return to Russia tomorrow.

The seige has been branded as an indication that Libya is still unstable two years on from the overthrow of Muammar Gaddafi.

Russia, the oil-producing country's long-standing ally, is now struggling to re-stabilise energy and arms deals worth billions of pounds.

After the fall of Gaddafi - who was captured and killed in October 2011 - Russia claims to have lost billions of dollars in arms deals.

Still fighting: Protesters demanding the execution of Abdullah al-Senussi, intelligence chief and brother-in-law of former leader Muammar Gaddafi, who is on trial for crimes committed during the 2011 uprising

Unrest: Russia lost billions when they were forced to withdraw oil and energy operations in Libya in 2011

The violence prompted Russian companies, which had pumped hundreds of 
millions of dollars into Libya's oil and natural gas sectors, to put 
their investments on hold.

The attack on the embassy occurred as a Russian delegation was planning 
to visit Libya to try to put commercial relations back on track, the 
head of a business council said.

The Kremlin - desperate to minimise any long-term impact between the countries - has turned its focus to Tripoli, where the Russian woman, who also wounded the officer's mother, has been arrested.

This is the latest in a series of attacks on Western diplomats.

Clan and tribal rivalries, and Islamist groups, have flourished without a strong central government in Libya.

Change: It is two years since Gaddafi was overthrown, which destabilised Russia's relationship with Libya

Security services have struggled to maintain order.

On September 11 last year, al Qaeda-linked militants attacked the U.S. 
consulate in Benghazi, killing Ambassador Christopher Stevens and three 
other Americans.

Moscow-based analyst Georgy Mirsky said: 'When Gaddafi was in charge, ties (between Libya and Russia) were good.

'He was buying our weapons and there was talk of a railroad being built.

'This kind of thing happens all the time, there is no reason to exaggerate it.'
