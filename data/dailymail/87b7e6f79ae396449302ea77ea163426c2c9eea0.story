It was Grigor Dimitrov’s girlfriend, Maria Sharapova, who once joked that her movement on clay resembled ‘a cow on ice’.

It would be unfair to pin that label on the supremely athletic Bulgarian, but in the course of Friday’s exhilarating Wimbledon semi-final he may have set an unofficial record for slipping over on the coarsened Centre Court grass.

That may prove the most enduring memory of an afternoon of spills and thrills that resulted in Novak Djokovic winning 6-4 3-6 7-6 7-6 to set up a meeting with either Roger Federer or Canadian Milos Raonic.

Just as Sharapova eventually found her footing on the clay to the extent that she has won two French Open titles, you suspect that Dimitrov will similarly master the turf and be back one day as a Wimbledon champion.

He has proved this week in performances against Andy Murray, and now the 27-year-old Serb, that this is well within his compass, provided he can discover the consistent mental application that will be required.

As much as his young millionaire’s backside constantly bumping onto the hallowed lawn was a reason for defeat it was his occasional lapses at inopportune times that proved his undoing against such a magnificent competitor.

With Sharapova looking down from his competitor’s box it could so easily have gone into a decider, had Dimitrov mustered a little more composure on the quartet of set points he created in the fourth.

Another man down: Djokovic spends some time on his back after another gruelling point ends

As it is Djokovic will contest the thirteenth Grand Slam final of his career and try to arrest a run, beginning here a year ago, which has seen him lose the last three. As if he needs any more incentive, one more win would take him back to the world number one spot.

He was quick to give credit to his opponent, saying: 'I played against a future star, he is already a top player with quality shots and a great touch.,' he said. 'Like in my last match (against Marin Cilic in the quarter-finals) I allowed my opponent back in.

‘It’s a big challenge now for me as I have lost my last few Grand Slam finals when I could have won them all.'

He will be battle hardened this time after a tough campaign here and just about avoided his fate of last year, when Juan Martin Del Potro dragged him into a marathon five setter and softened him up for Andy Murray.

Nobody will relish the challenge more this time than the man from Kosovan mountains, so driven by national pride. The established stars have been somewhat under siege at this year’s Wimbledon, but nobody was going to mount more of a stand against them than Djokovic.

In previous years he has not enjoyed the dusty expanses that develop around the back of the court late in the championships but, ever the great problem solver, his movement has looked more comfortable this time.

The Bulgarian is fine athlete and his falls highlighted that Wimbledon needs to try and come up with a solution to the condition of the baseline as it appears to have deteriorated more in the last two years and someone might get injured. Perhaps the option of clay court footwear is called for in the latter rounds.

Gripped: Maria Sharapova, Dimitrov's girlfriend watches on anxiously from the players' box

Dimitrov is of a similar elastic body type to Djokovic and made some incredible ‘gets’ while slipping all over the place. Yet it was serving from a static position that often proved a problem with eight double faults.

There was one at 2-4 in the first tiebreak and 6-6 in the second, and three consecutive ones in the third game of the fourth set. Against Murray there was also the occasional poor game but Djokovic was able to exact a higher price.

In warm but breezy conditions the first set raced by in 27 minutes and brief encounter beckoned when the Serb broke for 3-2 in the end. But Dimitrov then produced four inspired games, featuring his glorious volleying skills, to level the match.

Spectator's view: Djokovic and Dimitrov slug it out on Centre Court

His sliced backhand was causing particular problems but Djokovic responded by coming forward more, doubtless urged by coach Boris Becker.

He saved a break point at 3-4 and in the ensuing tiebreak benefitted from the double fault and an ill-chosen drop shot, symptomatic of the Bulgarian’s sometimes skittish shot selection.

When the three double faults led to him going 2-2 down in the fourth it looked over, only for Dimitrov to respond with a fighting instinct that must have had his girlfriend purring with pride.

Tough: Djokovic made hard work of match against Andy Murray's quarter-final conqueror

Djokovic was
 so pumped to save a first set point at 4-5 that he led out a blood 
curdling yell, and then in the tiebreak had cause to be grateful for his
 opponent’s charity when he let slip a lead of 6-3.

There
 was the lack of a killer punch when he needed it and Djokovic was not 
afraid to move further up the court away from the troublesome areas 
around the back.

He clinched it 9-7 and afterwards expressed the hope that the crowd had enjoyed it, which they surely did.
