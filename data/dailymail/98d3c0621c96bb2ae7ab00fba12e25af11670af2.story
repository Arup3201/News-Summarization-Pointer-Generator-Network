A camera attached to the bottom of One World Trade Center's highest component has provided dizzying footage from the top of New York City's tallest building.

The final section of the spire, adorned with an American flag, was lifted by crane to the top of the skyscraper on Friday.

A GoPro camera mounted near its base documented the careful rise of the iron piece, as dozens of construction workers watched in awe.

Eye in the sky: The camera can be seen affixed near the base of the spire piece

The camera rolls for more than nine minutes, as the 18th and final piece of the spire puzzle is slowly brought to its new home with the smaller buildings seen far below.

As it reaches the top, three waiting workers guide the spire piece into its slot, and secure it in place - completing the job.

The spire's installation was completed Friday morning, after pieces of it had been transported to the roof of the building last week. Construction workers below applauded and cheered at the milestone.

'It's a pretty awesome feeling,' Juan Estevez, a construction project manager, said from a temporary platform on the roof of the tower where he and other workers watched the milestone.

'It's a culmination of a tremendous amount of team work... rebuilding the New York City skyline once again.'

The building is rising at the northwest corner of the site where the twin towers were destroyed in the Sept. 11, 2001, terror attacks.

The area is well on its way to reconstruction with the 72-story Four World Trade Center and other buildings.

Sky high: The addition of the spire, and its 
raising of the building's height to 1,776 feet, would make One World 
Trade Center the tallest structure in the U.S. and third-tallest in the 
world 

Inspiring: The spire will provide public transmission services for television and radio broadcast channels that were destroyed in the 9/11 terror attacks, along with the trade center towers

The 408-foot spire, weighing nearly 800 tons, will serve as a world-class broadcast antenna.

An LED-powered light emanating from it will be seen from miles away and a beacon will be at the top to ward off airplanes and helicopters.

Street Address: 1 World Trade Center

Proposed: 2005

Start of construction: 2006

Expected completion: 2014

Architectural height: 1776 feet

Occupied height: 1254 feet

Height to tip: 1792 feet

Height of spire: 408 feet

Floors above ground: 104

Floors below ground: 5

Number of elevators: 73

Top elevator speed: 10.16 m/s

Cost of construction: $3.8billion

Installation of the spire began in December, after 18 pieces were shipped from Canada and New Jersey.

With the beacon at its peak to ward off aircraft, the spire will provide public transmission services for television and radio broadcast channels that were destroyed on 9/11, along with the trade center towers.

Overlooking the Statue of Liberty and Ellis Island, the high-rise is scheduled to open for business in 2014.

The new tower's crowning spire is a joint venture between the ADF Group Inc. engineering firm in Terrebonne, Quebec, and New York-based DCM Erectors Inc., a steel contractor.

The addition of the spire, and its raising of the building's height to 1,776 feet, would make One World Trade Center the tallest structure in the U.S. and third-tallest in the world, although building experts dispute whether the spire is actually an antenna - a crucial distinction in measuring the building's height.

If it didn't have the spire, One World Trade Center would actually be shorter than the Willis Tower in Chicago, which stands at 1,451 feet and currently has the title of tallest building in the U.S., not including its own antennas.

The world's tallest building, topping 2,700 feet, is the Burj Khalifa in Dubai.
