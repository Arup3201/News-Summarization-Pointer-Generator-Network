A 21-year-old man who 'admitted to killing his girlfriend' in the early hours of Saturday morning has been charged with second-degree murder.

Though Clayton S. Whittemore, 21, allegedly confessed to police that he killed his girlfriend on her school campus at the College at Brockport in upstate New York, he is pleading not guilty.

Alexandra Kogut suffered 'extensive trauma to the upper body', according to the campus chief of police.

Press Connects reports that Whittemore is not a student at the school, which is a part of the State University of New York system, but his girlfriend was.

Her body was found in her room inside McLean Hall on campus.

The Utica Observer Dispatch says that the young woman's time of death is being placed between 1.30am and 2am and police only found her body after her mother called the university concerned about her daughter's well-being shortly after the alleged murder. The mother said that she became concerned when her daughter would not pick up her phone.

Whittemore was found by state patrols at 4am at a highway rest stop over 100 miles away in Dewitt, New York outside of Rochester. 

Dewitt is about halfway between the College at Brockport and the American-Canadian border at Niagara Falls.

Kogut’s heartbroken family yesterday described the young student as 'a bright, beautiful young woman who was thrilled to be beginning her college education'.

The school send an email to students informing them of the death early Saturday and updated their website as the case unfolded.

While they wrote that the victim's death occurred 'under suspicious circumstances', they wrote that 'there is no reason to believe that any other members of the campus community are endangered in any way.'

Whittemore lives in neighboring New Hartford and was a promising hockey star during high school. He was featured as an 'Athlete of the Week' by WKTV Utica in 2010.

He is being held under the custody of the Monroe County Sheriff and has yet to be issued bail.

'It's tragic when anyone loses their life,' campus police chief Robert Kehoe told ABC affiliate WHAM.

'When a young lady who's a college student and apparently in a safe environment, is brutally murdered as this young lady was, it's certainly a tragedy for her family and friends and the entire Brockport college community.'
