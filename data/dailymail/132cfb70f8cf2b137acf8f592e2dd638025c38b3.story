Real Madrid were taken apart by Atletico Madrid at the Vicente Calderon with Cristiano Ronaldo and Gareth Bale spectators as Diego Simone’s side ran riot in a  4-0 victory.

It is the first time in 64 years that Real have lost three straight games in the ground of their neighbours but this was different – this was embarrassing for the richest club in football, smothered from the first kick to last by their poor-relations city neighbours.

It's all over in Madrid as the home side earn a memorable victory at the Vicente Calderon. 

Goals from Tiago, Saul, Griezmann and Mandzukic secured a fantastic three points for Simeone's side who are now just four points behind the Galacticos. 

And that's four! Torres drives down the right and lofts in a beautiful cross for Mandzukic to power home with his head. Real have been outplayed and outclassed this afternoon. 

87mins: Ronaldo sums up his own afternoon by running the ball straight out of play as he attempted to bring his team forward. One to forget for the La Liga leaders. 

85mins: Jese is shown a yellow card for a poor challenge on Miranda. 

82mins: Real are now camped inside Atleti's half but the home side have just been too good today. Godin clears, Torres collects on the halway line before earning his team a free-kick. 

79mins: Bale wins a corner for Real as the visitors look to restore some pride at the very least. Kroos' first attempt is cleared and his second lands on the left boot of Illarramendi, who fires just over. 

75mins: Griezmann, who has worked his socks off today, is replaced to that man Fernando Torres. 

Pete Jenson: The last time Atletico Madrid beat Real 3-0 at home in the league it was 1970. No wonder Ancelotti is bringing on Chicharito

Pete Jenson: No one deserves a goal more than Griezmann. Arda's cross headed back across goal and the Frenchman wants it more than his international team-mate Varane. 3-0.

This is now embarrassing for Real Madrid. They have been out-fought by Simeone's team before, but never out-played like this.

Illarramendi replaces Isco. 

It's three! This time it's Griezmann at the far post with an easy tap in following some brilliant work by Turan and Mandzukic.

Turan skips along the edge of Madrid's penalty before lofting a cross to Mandzukic who heads the ball back into the path of Griezmann.  

60mins: Atletico come seriously close to a third as Griezmann makes the most of a Real defensive mix-up before hitting his shot straight at Casillas. 

Pete Jenson: Bale looks a different player in the second half getting up and down the pitch demanding the ball. And Jese threatening down the left. Still no news of Ronaldo.

57mins: Bale and Mandzukic were involved in a slight tangle as the latter is former is fouled. Godin is the latest name to enter the referee's book for dissent. 

Pete Jenson: It says a lot about Raul Garcia that he can pick up a suspension when he is not even on the pitch. He is booked for dissent while warming up and will now miss the next game.

47mins: Ronaldo stands with his hands on his hips inside the Atleti box as the referee calls for a foul by the Portuguese forward.

At the other end, the home fans are going mad as their counter-attack hits a wall after Mandzukic fouls Nacho. 

46mins: Jese replaces Khedira for the second half as Ancelotti opts for a more attacking formation with his team searching for three goals. 

We're back underway in Madrid. Can Carlo Ancelotti's side turn things around against their bitter rivals? They've got 45 minutes to do so...

Pete Jenson: Notable that no Real Madrid player said anything to a team-mate walking off the pitch. Each one with his head down.

Perhaps they are saving it for the dressing room. Defenders have not been great but they will be asking where the protection has been.

Jese warming up and will come on at the start of the second half. 

Pete Jenson: Ronaldo wearing new bright yellow boots in this game. And that’s the best you can say about him after that first half. Bale equally as irrelevant.

While two World Cup winners Toni Kroos and Sami Khedira completely over-run in midfield. And the less said about Real Madrid’ defence and goalkeeper the better.

Atletico too intense for their rivals and had Griezmann's goal stood, as it should have done, they would be 3-0 up.

45mins: Soft yellow card for Gabi, who perhaps just went into the back of Coentrao as the pair went up for a header.  

43mins: Griezmann and Siqueira link up well on the left before winning a throw-in for their side deep inside Real's half. Just two minutes until the break now, what a half for Simeone's side. 

37mins: Real attempt to turn the screw as Benzema looks to go it alone with a solo run into the Atleti box but he's easily outnumbered. 

Bale bombs down the right but his cross has too much on it and goes out for a throw. 

35mins: The Atleti playes, perhaps unfairly, have just screamed at the referee for what the believed to be a handball after Khedira blocked a shot from Godin. 

31mins: Kroos swings in a free-kick which momentarily cause chaos in the Atleti box. The ball bobbles around before Benzema forces a saves from Moya and the home side clear. 

28mins: Kroos is shown a yellow card for a late challenge on Griezmann. The Real players look shellshocked. 

Pete Jenson: Even Toni Kroos losing his cool chopping down Griezmann. Cynical and deserving of the yellow he was shown.

Pete Jenson: Arda Turan wriggles away from Coentrao but linesman flags a foul. Turan doesn't throw his boot this time. He's happy - Atletico on top and he's giving the reserve left back big problems.

26mins: Real attack with Ronaldo on the right but the Galactico aimlessly loops a ball into the Atleti box without looking. Moya collects the ball easily. 

Pete Jenson: Griezmann scores but is incorrectly flagged offside. Madrid are a disaster at the back without Pepe and Ramos.

The home side have doubled their lead and it's the substitute Saul with a brilliant overhead kick just outside Real Madrid's six-yard box. 

The strike came after some lovely individual work from Siqueira, who drove into the box before setting up his team-mate. 

Pete Jenson: Most unlikely of scorers. Tiago on 13 minutes aftetr Juanfran's corner is laid off by Mandzukic. Casillas' fumble in part responsible.

And Atletico have lead! Tiago strikes from the edge of the area and Casillas lets the ball slip underneath his right arm. First blood to Simeone's side! 

Pete Jenson: Big blow for Atleico losing Koke who looked as if he was caught late by Khedira. Saul, who Premier League clubs were looking at last season when he was on loan at Rayo, is on. Godin has a bloody nose - also from Khedira.

10mins: Early change for the home side as Saul replaces the injured Koko. 

Sportsmail's Pete Jenson: Atletico kicking into the end where their most vocal supporters are - they would have preferred that second half. Early signs of how wobbly Real might be today with Coentrao almost fouling Arda in the area.

Mandzukic and Griezmann start ahead of Torres after scoring in Atletico's recent win against Eibar. 

Torres will have to make an impact from the subs' bench if he is to establish himself in Atletico's first team. 

Real Madrid superstar Cristiano Ronaldo returns to action after serving a two-match ban for his two moments of madness against Cordoba.

The former Manchester United forward has scored 15 goals against Atletico since joining Real in 2009.
