Ronny Deila insists he’ll never ban his players from taking to social media – but has warned them against expending too much energy getting involved in online spats.

On Wednesday, Celtic striker Anthony Stokes took to Twitter to respond to Hearts supremo Ann Budge’s condemnation of the behaviour of a small minority of visiting fans during Sunday’s Scottish Cup tie at Tynecastle.

He Tweeted: ‘Maybe Ann Budge should worry about her own fans, never had so many Sectarian comments directed at me in a ground like Tynecastle the other day.’

Celtic manager Ronny Deila said he would not ban his players from using social media

The Irishman was subsequently subjected to a volley of online abuse, with one individual claiming he deserved to be shot.

Asked about the incident yesterday, Deila said there was nothing wrong in principle with players interacting through such forums.

However, he stressed that their actions shouldn’t detract from their capacity to concentrate on their jobs on the field.

‘I think it is a democracy and players have opinions and it is their right to speak,’ Deila stated.

‘But I think the players have to think about what they are doing - it is about using energy. If you are starting a fight with people, you are using your energy in doing that instead of playing football.

‘This is something that is happening more and more and we have to be aware of it. We have to educate the players from youth level of the effect this has on every individual and what they can do.

‘If I were them, I wouldn’t do it. But these are the players’ opinions, rather than the club’s opinions.’

Asked if he favoured educating players on the dangers of such media as opposed to introducing a blanket ban, the Celtic manager replied: ‘Yes. I think that’s the way you have to do it. That is the way it is now.’

Deila takes his side to Motherwell tomorrow having opened up a three-point lead over the chasing Premiership pack with a slender win over Partick Thistle on Wednesday.

And with his side still in the hunt for four trophies, he has warned that his fringe players face a battle to become part of his plans in the coming months.

‘We have so many important games coming up, we are in all three cups and we are fighting for the league – which is the most important thing – and there is great competition for places in the team so I don’t think there will be any problems,’ he added.

‘Everyone wants to play in the important matches and some games are more interesting than others but you have to perform to play in these games.

‘It’s a culture at Celtic that we have to win every game and I enjoy that culture. Now we have to keep that momentum going.’
