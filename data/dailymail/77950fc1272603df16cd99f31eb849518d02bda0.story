West Ham are finally starting to dream of Europe after manager Sam Allardyce claimed that his side is stronger than his Bolton team which finished seventh.

In the 2006-07 season Allardyce's Bolton found themselves third by the turn of the year, but defeat to Liverpool on New Years Day was followed by another three games without a win and the team ended up finishing seventh.

But the West Ham boss considers the West Ham side he has at his disposal is in a better position than that Bolton team.

'We were flying at Bolton at that time and were very close to getting where none of us expected,' Allardyce said.

'The prospects we have now is that this is a bigger squad than that one and has more strength in depth than this one. It has not quite got the experience but we have a lot of strength in depth and in the deeper end of the squad we have a lot of good players to step in when needed.

'That was not the case at Bolton. We had a strong 14 or 15 but nothing more than that. That is why it never lasted at Bolton, sadly.'

The 60-year-old is not allowing himself to get too carried away with the club sitting in fourth going into the busy festive period. They host Leicester on Saturday then have tough matches against Arsenal and Chelsea.

Asked if maintaining a place in the top four was possible, Allardyce replied: 'We don’t think that is the case at the moment – we’ll cross that bridge when Christmas is over as it can all change so quickly.

'Being a manager who predicts what might or might not be is very dangerous because you get times where you don’t get beaten for six games like Alan Pardew and now he is back in losing form because of injuries, particularly with his goalkeeper.

'Likewise, Southampton have lost five on the trot. There are swings and roundabouts in this game that is all so unpredictable. There is no good spouting off what you might or might not do because it might leap back and kick you right in the goolies.'
