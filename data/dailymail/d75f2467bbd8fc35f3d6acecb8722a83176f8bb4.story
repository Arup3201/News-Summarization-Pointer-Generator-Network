Southampton intend to pursue their policy of signing young English talent with a double swoop for move for Celtic goalkeeper Fraser Forster and Norwich winger Nathan Redmond. 

The south coast side are attempting to reconstruct their squad following the departures of Luke Shaw to Manchester United and Adam Lallana, Rickie Lambert and soon, Dejan Lovren, to Liverpool.

Manager Ronald Koeman is happy to remain true to the club's philosophy of mostly signing ambitious English youngsters to play alongside academy products.

Wanted: Southampton are set to move for Celtic goalkeeper Fraser Forster

Targeted: They have also been linked with a move for Nathan Redmond of Norwich

Southampton are understood to have already been rebuffed in initial attempts to secure both Forster and Redmond but they have resolved to return for the pair.

Staff at Southampton are unsure over Artur Boruc after several erratic moments last season and new goalkeeping coach Dave Watson has recommended Forster, who could cost up to £9million, as an alternative.

England goalkeeping coach Watson has worked with Forster with the national team, for whom the 26-year-old is Roy Hodgson's third choice stopper.

Uncertain: They remain unconvinced by current first choice Artur Boruc

Linked: They are also considering a move for Burnley forward Danny Ings

Meanwhile, Southampton have already seen a £3.5m approach for Redmond turned down but they believe that relegated Norwich will be tempted to part with the England under-21 international for a fee approaching £6.5m.

Stoke, Everton and Swansea are also monitoring Redmond's situation at Carrow Road.

Burnley forward Danny Ings also remains on the Saints' radar. He has only one left on his contract.

The Lancashire club are determined to keep hold of the forward, who himself is not angling for a move, but the financial incentive of serious offer could prove too good to turn down.
