The troubled development of the Circuit of Wales now faces a public inquiry in March, throwing into doubt next year's staging of the British round of MotoGP.

Work should have commenced on the £315million motorsports venue on the outskirts of Ebbw Vale in February last year.

However, the organisation behind the project, the Heads of the Valleys Development Company (HVDC), have encountered a number of planning permission hurdles.

Despite signing a five-year agreement in August last year to host MotoGP, CoW bosses were quickly forced to hand over the staging of this season's event to Donington Park.

HVDC then sought permission to de-register 600 acres of common land at Rassau, Blaenau Gwent, the site for the proposed circuit.

Despite belief that would swiftly be granted and work would finally start in December or January, only now has the decision been taken to hold an inquiry, due to commence on March 10 for eight days.

The inquiry has the support of the CoW, with chief executive Michael Carrick stating: 'The planning process is a lengthy one and we will continue to work with the planning body to ensure on-site works start as soon as possible in 2015.

'We are still aiming to have phase one site-wide and circuit infrastructure ready to host MotoGP when completed.

'This is a hugely important development, not just for the regeneration of Blaenau Gwent, but also for the UK economy.

'It's critical we ensure every detail is considered in the planning process before construction works can commence.'

Following the inquiry, and even if permission is eventually granted, HVDC could yet face a judicial review, which would push development back further.

Any additional delays would then impact on CoW's hopes of hosting MotoGP next year.
