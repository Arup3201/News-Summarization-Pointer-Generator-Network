As if health concerns weren't reason enough to perhaps avoid fast food, an ex-Burger King employee has provided another.

In the latest instance of a fast food worker posting obscene behavior on-the-job to social media, a young Burger King employee in Japan recently posted a picture of himself laying down on a pile of hamburger buns to Twitter.

The fast food chain apologized and the employee was fired for his actions, according to a statement posted online.

Baka King: This former Burger King Japan employee outraged people in the country with his on-the-job antics

Uploaded by Twitter user @inotayuta, who until recently slung Whoppers for the burger giant in Japan, the picture shows the young Japanese sloucher relaxing with a huge grin on his face and the caption ‘How many Whopper Juniors do you think I've made? See if you can figure out it for yourself.’

As upsetting as the image of an employee lounging on buns is, several people were also upset by the filthy bucket next to the buns, in a posting of the picture to the Japanese website 2ch.

The same Twitter user also posted a picture of himself sitting in a trash can while on the job.

Kotaku rightly pointed out that the outrage among Japanese stems from a culture where food and excellent customer service are considered very important. For an employee to deface the food in such a manner is reprehensible, if not unforgivable.

Hard at work: The now-deleted Twitter account was a showcase for this employees less-than-stellar work ethic

Users on 2ch, the country’s largest online forum, emailed the company en masse, demanding action be taken. 

In a statement, Burger King Japan assured customers that the buns were trash and not served for consumption. It also said the employee was receiving a strict reprimand for the photos, which BuzzFeed reported was his termination.

The offensive employee’s Twitter account has been deleted, but many on the site have taken to calling him ‘Baka King,’ baka means ‘stupid,' but is also a play on the Japanese spelling of Burger as 'ba-ga-.'

The burger chain also said staff would be retrained on proper customer service and sanitation – hopefully that includes not sitting in the trash and adequate cleaning of buckets. At least he didn't lick the buns.

Not served to customers: Burger King said the buns were disposed of and not served to customers, just as Taco Bell asserted the taco shells licked by this employee were not served either

This is not the first photo the ex-employee posted to social media of on-the-job goofing off

Japanese Twitter users have taken to calling him 'Baka King,' a play on the chain's name which translates to 'stupid'
