For most people a chance to taste the food in a city they're visiting is one of the most important parts of the experience. However it seems that many of the best spots are hidden, even from the locals.

After returning from the US, Melbourne-based woman Jonette George was astounded that although there were cookbooks galore on Australian shelves no one was unearthing the already established restaurants and eateries.

'My girls had gone to school in America … and we came back to Australia and said "God, why isn't anyone showcasing our region's culinary destinations?",' Ms George told Daily Mail Australia. 

'So we thought we would enter into the sphere.

Two new books showcasing the best culinary destinations in Sydney have been released, with Bloodwood in the inner-city suburb of Newtown making the cut

The Apollo Restaurant in Potts Point, famed for its Greek cuisine features in one of the editions, Flavours of Sydney

'I think there are lots of cookery books but there aren't as many culinary destinations,' Ms George said before adding: 'People want to know the best place to go and not waste a night on an average restaurant.' 

What began as a small book focusing on Noosa on Queensland's Sunshine Coast quickly turned into an internationally acclaimed series of 'pictorial registries' of various city's hot-spots.

The latest editions - Flavours of Sydney and Flavours of Urban Sydney - focus on the NSW capital, while those before them have looked at the best restaurants, bars and cafes in Melbourne.

'They used to say Melbourne was ahead of Sydney in terms of food, but it’s not', said Ms George.

Flavours of Sydney features establishments such as The Apollo Restaurant in Potts Point, which prides itself on its Greek cuisine, and Spanish tapas hub El Bulli in Surry Hills.

All editions are brimming with stunning pictures, taken by head of photography Kaitlyn Wilton, Ms George's youngest daughter, along with Amanda Davenport and Alana Dimou.

Kaitlyn's elder sister Daniele also plays a major role in the family business heading up design and administration.

They also include recipes from a select number of locations which are tried and tested by members of the team ahead of their publication.

'Some are more complicated than others but it gives you a chance to emulate different restaurants,' said Ms George, Editor-In-Chief of the series. 

Ananas Bar and Brasserie is one of the must-see establishments for Sydney-siders and visitors alike

Flavours of Sydney and Flavours of Urban Sydney are the latest in a series of books, with editions on Queensland, South Australia and Tasmania in the works

Bentley Restaurant and Bar in Sydney's CBD was also given the thumbs up from the team

One of the latest books - Flavours of Sydney - focuses on inner-city spots, while Flavours of Urban Sydney takes in the city's outer suburbs and more multicultural cuisines.

Criteria for selecting the establishments is simple: 'Our criteria is we would recommend it to our best friends', Ms George revealed.

'We put together a database of all the restaurants we can find in that destination then we start visiting them.

'It needs to have either unique food, service or a venue,' she added. 

The Flavours of Melbourne and Flavours of Urban Melbourne books have won a series of international awards including best culinary travel cookbook in Australia atThe Gourmand World Cookbook Awards, a bronze medal at the International Publishers Awards (IPPY), and another bronze at IPPY for best International Travel Guidebook.

Next on the hit-list is the sunshine state of Queensland, and despite some initial apprehension the team have been pleasantly surprised by the talent the state has turned up.

It is located in the city's famous Flinders Lane in the heart of Melbourne's CBD 

Criteria for selecting establishments comes down to one thing: whether the team would recommend the place to their best friend

'We were a bit wary of going to Queensland because it doesn't have an amazing rep for its food, but we’re discovering some amazing chefs,' Ms George revealed.

After Queensland's culinary spots have been visited, the team hope to take on the rest of Australia.

'We’re tossing up at the moment whether we do South Australia or Tasmania next, but both should be out this year,' Ms George said.

'It’s like an adventure, where do we go next?'

Flavours of Sydney and Flavours of Urban Sydney are now available from Smudge Publishing.
