Manchester United have already agreed the personal terms of a proposed summer transfer for loan signing Radamel Falcao in a bid to avoid a repeat of the wage wrangle they had with Carlos Tevez five years ago.

United signed the Colombia centre forward on loan from Monaco on the last day of the summer transfer window.

Having paid a loan fee of £6million to the French club for the 28-year-old, United have also agreed to a transfer fee of £43.5m if they decide to take the striker permanently at the end of the season.

Radamel Falcao has cost around £95m in transfer fees so far in his career

River Plate-Porto - £3.2m (August 2009)

Porto-Atletico Madrid - £35m (August 2011)

Atletico-Monaco - £51m (July 2013)

Monaco-Man Utd - £6m (loan fee, Sept 2014) 

Now it has emerged that United chief executive Ed Woodward has already agreed a £250,000-a-week wage – as well as bonuses and image rights – with the player and his representatives ahead of next summer.

United are keen to avoid a battle similar to the one they had with Tevez in 2009.

Back then, the striker had been loan at Old Trafford for two seasons and the club had agreed to meet a £25m buy-out clause with the Argentine’s owners at the end of it. However, the deal collapsed when they couldn’t agree personal terms with Tevez and he eventually joined rivals Manchester City.

This time, United have nailed down terms with Falcao to ensure that there is no room for negotiation should the player’s representatives seek more money next May.

United will decide whether to take the player permanently based on his form over the next eight months but also his injury record, given that he missed the World Cup after surgery on cruciate ligament damage.

Meanwhile, United have denied suggestions they can cancel their loan agreement with Monaco if Falcao suffers a recurrence of his knee trouble.
