A Sydney father is taking on department store giant Myer to stop it stocking dolls he has labelled as 'anorexic'.

Mark Chenery, from Manly, was shopping at Myer at Warringah Mall with his four-year-old daughter, Sophia, when the Winx dolls caught his attention on May 1.

'We were in the toy section and I noticed this doll,' he said. 'What struck me first was their legs, they looked seriously anorexic.

Mark Chenery handed over a 1,315-signature petition, with daughter Sophia and Fair Agenda director Rebecca Wilson

The super-skinny Winx dolls have outraged a Northern Beaches father who says the toys send the wrong message to healthy kids

'I have always had an objection to Barbie dolls, which are out of proportion for kids dolls, but this took it to another level.'

The Winx dolls are based on characters from Italian cartoon Winx Club set in the fictional world of Magix where three schools educate fairies, witches, wizards and warriors. Dolls are sold by retailers with prices up to $49.99.

Mr Chenery was so outraged by the Magic Wings Bloom range of dolls - which are aimed at children four years old and up - that he posted a photo of one on social media where it caught the attention of campaigning group Fair Agenda. 

'I posted it on Facebook and I had such a great response from family and friends, and one of them thought I should start a campaign and here we are 1,300 signatures later,' he said.

'One of the reasons I reacted so strongly was because I just know how much Sophia loves dressing up as a fairy.

'By presenting such body images to kids, it’s sending a dangerous message.'

Mr Chenery and supporters were at Pitt Street Myer on Tuesday to hand over the petition

On Tuesday, the 1,315-signature petition was presented to Myer's Pitt St store manager.

It will now be passed onto Myer's head office.

Mr Chenery said Myer had been in contact with Fair Agenda in relation to the issue.

Fair Agenda executive director Renee Carr said they threw their support behind the campaign because it was an issue members of the group were interested in.

'When we saw how much support Mark's campaign  was getting, and the kinds of messages of support being shared by eating disorder specialists, counsellors and early childhood educators; we wanted to help him deliver those messages to Myer - to make sure they saw just how important this issue was to customers,' she said.

'We also had hundreds of members come together around the country (at) our launch earlier this year to share the issues they wanted to see on the agenda, these kinds of issues attracted a lot of support.'

Myer and Winx have been contacted for comment.
