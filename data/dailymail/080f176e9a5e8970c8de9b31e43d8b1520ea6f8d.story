Emmanuel Adebayor admits he could not sleep after he broke the defensive wall to allow Stewart Downing to score for West Ham from a free-kick against Tottenham earlier this month.

The Togolese striker, in an exclusive interview with Fabrice Muamba in the Daily Express, said he imagined something was going to kill him when the ball was struck towards him in the Hammers' 2-0 win on May 3 at Upton Park.

'Those are the things in football where you have made a mistake and you go home and you ask yourself: "Why did that happen today?"

'When I saw the ball coming, I don't know what happened. For me, it was like something was going to kill me.

Adebayor said he shared his embarrassment with team-mate Paulinho following the goal, and took his shame home with him that evening.

'If there were no mistakes, there would never be a football match. I am not saying what I did was a very good thing - that night I could not sleep.

'When I gave way, I looked Paulinho and was like: "Did we just do this on TV?"'

The 30-year-old's future is still in doubt at Spurs after Tim Sherwood was sacked earlier this week.
