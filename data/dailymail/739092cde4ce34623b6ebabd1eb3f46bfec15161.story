This is the chilling moment a drunk thug pulled a handgun on unarmed officers - and aimed it straight at them.

Joshua Granger, 22, marched towards officers clutching the weapon and warning them: 'Bring your boys down as I’m up for a fight'.

It later transpired that Granger’s pistol was a replica. But a judge at Guernsey’s Royal Court told him he was fortunate the police weren’t armed themselves - or he could have been shot dead.

Granger, who had recently split up with his girlfriend, told police in a later interview that his intention had been to provoke them into shooting him.

The shocking video, which was caught on a police car’s dashboard camera, happened on October 21 last year when Granger's girlfriend dialled 999 to say he was threatening to overdose.

The court heard a lone PC made two trips to the house as his behaviour became more erratic.

When he knocked on the door for the second time Granger emerged from the property wielding the lookalike weapon.

The thug took aim at the petrified cop who fired several blasts of pepper spray in a failed attempt to disarm him.

Granger then pointed it at a second 
policeman who arrived moments later in a squad car - its dashboard 
camera filming him as he advanced towards them.

A third officer then arrived and tried to negotiate with Granger as his two colleagues cowered behind their vehicle.

They all believed the gun was real until Granger’s mother and sister appeared and told them it was probably just a BB gun.

The chaotic stand-off in Guernsey’s St Peter Port area was finally brought to a close when Granger’s sister persuaded him to hand it over and give himself up.

Jailing him for three years, Judge Russell Finch said he was fortunate that the police had not resorted to more 'extreme measures' to take him down.

He told Granger: 'You would have only had yourself to blame if you had ended up lying in the road seriously injured or even worse.'

The court heard the two officers were left traumatised by their ordeal, with one reduced to tears.

Granger admitted in his police interview he had taken an overdose of prescription medicine and spent the night drinking alcohol after splitting up with his girlfriend.

He said his aim was to provoke the officers into shooting him, not the other way around.
