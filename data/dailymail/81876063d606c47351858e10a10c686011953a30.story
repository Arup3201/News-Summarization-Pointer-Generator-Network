Kevin de Bruyne scored twice to put Wolfsburg in control of their Europa League tie with Inter, before the former Chelsea star jumped into the crowd to conduct the celebrations.

De Bruyne produced a brilliantly display on the pitch, and then led the Wolfsburg supporters in their post-match chanting, as the German side came from behind to give themselves an excellent chance of progress.

Rodrigo Palacio had put the visitors ahead after just five minutes, but Inter struggled to defend what should have been a valuable away goal, and Naldo powered a header home to equalise after half an hour from a De Bruyne corner.

And in the second half De Bruyne, formerly of Chelsea, stole the show, finding the net from a neat cut-back and then an excellent free kick, although both goals owed much to the poor goalkeeping of Juan Pablo Carrizo.  

The Belgian's first goal came after Vierinha had seized on a poor clearance from the Inter keeper, surged into the box, and crossed perfectly for De Bruyne to slide home.

Then, with 15 minutes to go, the former Chelsea forward's free kick snuck past Carrizo, despite it being aimed at the side of the goal he was meant to be covering.

De Bruyne could easily have completed a hat-trick, but he shot wide when through on goal in the closing stages, with only Carrizo to beat.

Wolfsburg showed that they could continue their good form without goals from Europe's hottest striker at the moment, Bas Dost. The Dutchman was well below his best before he was replaced midway through the second half by Niklas Bendtner, but De Bruyne took up the slack.

Inter, meanwhile, under former Manchester City boss Roberto Mancini, were poor for large periods of the game, offering little going forward, and unable to keep up the defensive solidity they had shown in the first half once they began to tire in the second 45.  

De Bryune decided to conduct his own chanting with the Wolfsburg supporters after their win
