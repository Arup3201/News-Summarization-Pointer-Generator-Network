A mother was shocked when she logged onto a town’s webcam to check the weather and saw what a strange blue light hovering in the sky. 

Denise Poole, 52, gasped as she watched the strange blue disk hovering above a school on the Channel Island of Guernsey.

Wondering if it was simply the sun’s glare, she rang a friend who logged on and saw the same glowing orb, which had a thin red fin almost resembling a rudder.

The pair then watched as it moved slowly across the screen and vanished for a few moments before reappearing.

Weirder still, mum-of-one Denise says she put a freeze-frame of the mystery object on Facebook to show friends – only for the image to disappear.

Police said they had no 999 calls or suspicious sightings of a saucers hovering above Elizabeth College in St Peter Port on Sunday morning.

But Denise, a carer, said: ‘I log on 
every morning to see what’s going on around the town, if the beach is 
busy or just to see if it’s a nice day – and there was this thing 
hovering in the sky.

‘It 
looked as if it was spinning. I thought I was seeing things. I thought 
“Crumbs nobody will believe me” so I took a few pictures on my phone.

‘Every now and again it went away and then came back again.

‘It could well be the glare from sun but even so it’s a pretty spooky image.’
