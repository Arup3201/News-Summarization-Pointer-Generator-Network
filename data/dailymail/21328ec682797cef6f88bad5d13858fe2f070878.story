An argument on live Greek TV turned violent after an extreme far-right Holocaust denier assaulted two left-wing deputies during a morning political show.

Ilias Kasidiaris, spokesman for Golden Dawn, threw a glass of water at Rena Dorou, a member of the radical left Syriza party, when she made a reference to a court case pending against him.

He then turned on Liana Kanelli, a prominent Communist party member, and punched her several times about the head.

The fracas broke out on the private Antenna TV station during a political discussion ahead of Greece's repeat elections on June 17.

Kasidiaris, 31, bounded out of his seat and hurled a glass of water across the table over Ms Dorou when she said there was a 'crisis of democracy when people who will take the country back 500 years have got into the Greek parliament'.

He then turned on prominent Communist
Party member Liana Kanelli, who had got out of her chair with a 
newspaper in hand and appeared to throw it at the Golden Dawn member.

Talk show host Giorgos Papadakis ran over to Kasidiaris to attempt to calm him, shouting 'no, no, no', but Kasidiaris, who served in the Greek military's special forces, hit Ms Kanelli around the face three times.

Kasidiaris was elected to parliament in the country's recent inconclusive polls. Deputies from all seven parties that won parliament seats in the May 6 polls had been invited on the show.

A public prosecutor ordered his immediate arrest for the attacks.

Government spokesman Dimitris Tsiodras said: 'The government condemns in the most categorical way the attack by Golden Dawn spokesman Ilias Kasidiaris against Liana Kanelli and Rena Dourou. This attack is an attack against every democratic citizen.'

Mr Tsiodras called on Golden Dawn to condemn its member's actions.

Golden Dawn, which vehemently denies the neo-Nazi label, has been accused of being behind violent attacks against immigrants.

Just before the attack, Kasidiaris had thrown water at Rena Dourou who made a reference to an impending trial

The party won nearly 7 per cent of the vote on May 6, giving it 21 seats in the 300-member parliament. It was a radical increase from its showing in the previous elections in 2009, when the party won just 0.31 per cent of the vote.

Greeks reeling from two years of austerity amid their country's vicious financial crisis punished the two formerly main parties, the conservative New Democracy and socialist PASOK at the polls, turning instead to radical smaller parties to the right and left of the political spectrum.

The 300 deputies took up their seats for a day last month before parliament was dissolved and new elections called as no party had won enough votes to form a government on its own, and negotiations for a coalition government collapsed after 10 days.
