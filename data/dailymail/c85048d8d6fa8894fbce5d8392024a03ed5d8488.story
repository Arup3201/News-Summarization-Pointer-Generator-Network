Wales players trained on the Millennium Stadium pitch on Friday as they put together their final preparations for the challenge of the All Blacks in Cardiff.

Sam Warburton led his side out for the captain's run, with the likes George North and Leigh Halfpenny also in action at the home of Welsh rugby.

And Rhys Webb, Jamie Roberts and Jonathan Davies were also among those involved, and head coach Warren Gatland oversaw proceedings, as they ready themselves to face the Southern Hemisphere side.

It has been 61 years since Wales last beat New Zealand, suffering 25 defeats on the spin and conceding more than 800 points in the process. 

For the All Blacks, it will be their final match in Northern Hemisphere before the World Cup next year.

And Wales full back Halfpenny believes that self-belief will be vital if his side are to end their barren run against the best side in the world.

'It's a huge challenge, but one that we are very excited about,' he said. 'We will have to be at the top of our game to be in with a shout of winning.

'We need to play for the 80 minutes and cannot afford to have a lapse of concentration against a side as good as the All Blacks. 

'We have to believe that we can win, right from the first minute. There is respect for them, but we have to treat them exactly the same as other opponents.

'There is a buzz and excitement and the fact that we haven't beaten the All Blacks for so long means there is an opportunity for us.

'There have been some great victories during my career in a Welsh shirt, but to beat the All Blacks would be at the top of them.'
