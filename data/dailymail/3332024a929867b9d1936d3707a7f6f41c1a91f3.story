 Just when we thought they were finally over, it appears Justin Bieber and Selena Gomez may be giving things another go.

The former couple were spotted enjoying a romantic dinner date at Mastro's Steakhouse in Beverly Hills on Thursday night. 

According to TMZ, which published a photo from the evening, the pair left in the same car and drove to Selena's West Hollywood hotel.

Mastros is the couple's favourite date-night spot - they have often visited the upmarket steak house during their relationship.

She might be a global superstar, but Selena Gomez is a true belieber, we mean believer, in the British high street.

The Latino beauty is a huge fan of Topshop, and has their distressed skinny jeans in pretty much every color; here looking spectacular as ever in a pair of gray Jamie versions with ripped knees.

Selena proved that you don’t need to spend copious amounts of cash to look good, and ripped it up in the style stakes yet again in this gorgeous outfit of a ribbed grey jumper, kimono coat and brown ankle boots.

And what’s more, you can recreate Selena’s simple and affordable style with a quick click to the right, because these jeans are still up for grabs in a similar color at a very reasonable $70.

The latest twist in the pair's four-year on/off love story comes after fans had decided the two may well have moved on.

Come & Get It singer Selena has been enjoying single life since her most recent split from the 20-year-old pop superstar, with whom she has a tumultuous relationship.

The Spring Breakers star was the centre of attention at a Golden Globes after party on Sunday night where she mixed with her celebrity pals.

She was even spotted holding hands of 25-year-old DJ Zedd, giving showbiz spectators quite the chance to gossip over a potential new romance in her life.

Making Justin jealous? If that was Selena's intention then it seems to have done the trick

The two looked like a couple as they made their way side by side past a sea of people that included valets and other party goers.

Earlier in the evening, she rested her arms on the shoulder of the handsome music man while on the red carpet with model Cara at the InStyle/Warner Bros, party.

Perhaps the shots prompted Justin to call. Since their last split in the autumn, he has been linked to Hailey Baldwin and a host of other girls.

But Justin and Selena seem unable to move on from their youthful romance, with each being the other's first love.

They are first thought to have begun dating way back in 2010, going public with their romance at the Vanity Fair Oscars party in February 2011.

For a while all seemed perfect, until the two split  in November 2012. They briefly reunited in April 2013, before getting back together that Fourth Of July.

On Selena's 21st birthday that year Justin is said to have surprised her by turning up with a single red rose. 

But by the end of the year they had broken up again - and proceeded to make up and break up countless times over the course of 2014.

A family vacation with Justin's family in August seemed an indication that things were becoming more stable. This was reinforced when the two were spotted  attending church together.

But at the end of September the pair had a furious row at an airport, which seemed the final nail in the coffin of their romance.

And apart from occasional tweets the two had not been seen together since the autumn, until Thursday.
