As a famous soap star in her home country, Mexican First Lady Angelica Rivera must have felt right at home during one highlight of her trip to the UK.

Last night the glamorous wife of President Enrique Pena Nieto was feted at Buckingham Palace and today she dropped in on another famous stately home - Downton Abbey - to meet the stars of the costume drama.

Perhaps the visit signals a new acting role for the 45-year-old beauty, who was joined on set by an elegant-looking Sophie, Countess of Wessex?

Ms Rivera looked chic in a tailored black jacket with a bold black and white gingham fishtail knee-length skirt.

The mother-of-three, who is famous in Latin America for playing La Gaviota - the seagull - in the hit Mexcian soap opera Distilling Love, carried a patent leather bag and wore her hair loose.

Sophie looked classic and elegant in a Prada coat that she wore for the first time on her 50th birthday in January. She teamed it with Bruce Oldfield high heeled courts, a Sophie Habsburg Design bag called Moneypenny in burgundy and a Jaeger-LeCoultre Reverso watch.

Her gold UFO earrings are favourites that she's worn on several occasions since 2005. 

The royal and Ms Rivera posed for a picture with Elizabeth McGovern, who plays Lady Cora, Hugh Bonneville aka the Earl of Grantham, Laura Carmichael who plays Lady Edith, Lady Mary actress Michelle Dockery and Sophie McShera who plays Daisy. 

It's not the first time Sophie has visited the set and the show's cast members have supported the Countess at events for Tomorrow's People, a charity helping disadvantaged people.

In November, the Countess attended a Tomorrow's People fundraiser at St George's church, London, with Downton stars including Laura Carmichael, Jim Carter and Penelope Wilton.

However today's visit was a private one as she didn't announce it or post it on her royal diary. 

Ms Rivera then followed her day out on set with another lavish black tie event, this time at London's Guildhall with her husband who was resplendent in white tie and tails and a sash.

The banquet is being thrown in their honour by the Lord Mayor and the City of London Corporation. 

Once again his wife showed off her impeccable taste with a floor-length black gown and a matching flowing evening jacket, trimmed with fur.

As ever her jewellery was kept simple and her loose up-do  showed off two dangling diamond earrings.

Last night, Ms Rivera and her husband were the guests of honour of the Queen and the Duke of Edinburgh at a state dinner at Buckingham Palace.

The couple have had a busy three days of official events including a state banquet last night

They were joined by the Prince of Wales, the Duchess of Cornwall, the Princess Royal and the Duke of York at the lavish event and dined on a menu of noisettes of Windsor estate lamb and spiced chocolate torte.

Hollywood actress Salma Hayek was among the 170 guests and seated between Chancellor George Osborne and Cabinet Secretary and Head of the Civil Service Sir Jeremy Heywood on the horseshoe-shaped table, which was decorated with gold candelabra and elaborate pink, red, purple and green floral displays.

Ms Rivera, who was seated between Philip and Prince Charles, was dressed in an asymmetric off-the-shoulder scarlet floor-length gown which co-ordinated with her husband's ceremonial sash.

After a ceremonial welcome on Horse Guards Parade on Monday, the president and the first lady joined the Queen, Philip, Charles, Camilla, Andrew and the Duke and Duchess of Gloucester for lunch in the Blue Drawing Room before going on to view an exhibition of Mexican items from the Royal Collection in the Picture Gallery.

Among the exhibits was an embroidered leather and wood horse saddle which was presented to Philip when the monarch and the Duke watched a display of horsemanship during a state visit to the Latin American nation in 1975.

The Duke patted the top of the saddle, which is engraved with the name 'Principe Felipe' in his honour as he spoke to Ms Rivera through an interpreter.

At an exchange of gifts, the Queen gave the president a copy of a 17th century Adriaen van Diest painting of Buckingham House and a pair of silver framed photographs of herself and Philip. The first lady was given a Linley box. 

Ms Rivera laughed and joked with Prince Philip as he showed them a Mexican saddle engraved with 'Principe Felipe' - his name in Spanish - dating back to a 1975 visit to the Latin American country
