One in three workers would prefer more holidays to a pay rise and most believe that the promise of extra time off would motivate them to switch jobs, according to a report.

A survey of almost 8,000 adults in 24 countries found that those in Britain and Europe had more holiday time than workers in the Asia Pacific region and North America. 

It found that 61 per cent of Britons said the chance for more holiday time would motivate them to change employer.

A third of workers would prefer more holidays to a pay rise and 61% said the chance for more holiday time would motivate them to change employer

The highest number of days offered to staff is 30 in Denmark, France, Germany and Spain, 28 in Italy, and 26 in Britain. 

In comparison, holidays totalled 15 days in the US and Mexico, and just 11 in Thailand, according to the study for travel website Expedia.

The average is 28 in Europe the researchers found, but added that the Italians take only 21 out of their entitled 28 days off, with Britons taking 25 out of their 26. 

Workers in South Korea took only seven of 15 available days in the past year.

Andy Washington, of Expedia.co.uk, said: 'While habits differ, the emotional impact of holiday does not.

'Somewhere between 80 per cent and 90 per cent of people worldwide say that holidays make them feel happier, better rested, closer to their family, less stressed and more relaxed.'
