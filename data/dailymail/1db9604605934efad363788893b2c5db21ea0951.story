Sophie Pearl Dalzell, 20, (pictured leaving Manchester Magistrates' Court) was found guilty of assaulting the officers in Cumbria last year

A soft porn model who assaulted two police officers in a drunken attack has been spared jail after telling magistrates she missed two probation appointments because she was getting a boob job in Belgium.

Sophie Pearl Dalzell, 20, was found guilty of assaulting the officers in Cumbria last year and was ordered to carry out community work and undergo supervision by probation officers.

However, she was hauled back to court and charged with breaching the order after probation staff claimed she failed to provide a reasonable excuse for missing the January meetings.

But Dalzell was cleared of the alleged breach by magistrates after producing a letter from a plastic surgeon during a day-long trial at Manchester Magistrates' Court.

It confirmed she was having a breast enlargement in Brussels at the time of the scheduled probation meetings.

The law states that defendants can miss a probation meeting but only for a valid reason and if proof, such as a letter from a doctor or employer, is given.

An alleged breach of an order can result in the individual being brought back before the court and potentially being sent to prison.

Dalzell, of Manchester, hit out at probation chiefs after being cleared.

She said: ‘I’m just annoyed I have had to go through this when I haven’t done anything wrong.

'I went for a breast enlargement. They were fine about it at the time and now they have tried to breach me for it.’

The case comes barely a year after the model was fined for refusing to wear an electronic tag in a separate case - claiming it would interfere with her adult TV work.

Dalzell, who has 11 previous convictions, was ordered to wear a tag for eight weeks in 2012 after failing to carry out community service for criminal damage.

She was convicted after she became involved in a row outside 5th Avenue nightclub in Manchester. During the dispute with a male driver of a BMW car, she slapped him in the face and kicked his car causing damage.

However, when security firm G4S turned up to fit her electronic tag, she refused to let them put it on her ankle, claiming she would get the sack if she wore it.

Dalzell, who was working for racy, late night TV channels at the time, was hauled back into court and fined £200.

She was later found guilty of assaulting the two police officers during a night out in Workington, Cumbria.

Magistrates told her yesterday that she still had to pay more than £150 in unpaid fines.

John Morris, defending, said: ‘There certainly seems to have been a breakdown in the relationship between some probation officers and the client.’

Magistrates were previously told she no longer worked in adult TV and had since moved into modelling, photoshoots, hosting and other presenting jobs.

A spokesman for the Cheshire and Greater Manchester Community Rehabilitation Company said: ‘When appropriate, we return offenders to court for failure to comply with their orders.’
