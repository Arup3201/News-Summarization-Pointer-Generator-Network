An American Lego master  has recreated the iconic Fawlty Towers hotel lobby completely out of plastic bricks.

Nathan Feist, the 21-year-old constructor, has succeeded where Basil Fawlty failed and brought a semblance of functionality to the most dysfunctional hotel in the seaside town of Torquay on the 'English Riviera'.

The intricately detailed model, made for the annual BrickFair Lego convention in Virginia,  includes the staircase, lobby and reception area from the set of the classic comedy.

In order to get a true representation of the hotel lobby Nathan had watched the 1970s sitcom many times on Netflix

Hints referring to 'The Germans' episode have been captured in the model, with the moose head and its drooping antler, as well as the fire alarm and extinguisher.

Manhattan-born Feist, a student at Cornell University in New York, chose the classic seventies sitcom, starring John Cleese, because he wanted to pay homage to one of his favourite television series - that he could exhibit at the convention.

'I had already seen a Counter Strike map that recreated the Fawlty Towers hotel and which was featured on Charlie Brooker's Screenwipe, but I couldn't find any LEGO models of the hotel posted online' Nathan said.

'So I figured that if someone had only made a good virtual model of it, I should make an accurate physical one.

'I plan to modify this and post another set of photos once I get some parts I don't yet own and will maybe even build the upstairs or exterior.' Nathan said.

The convention comprises  of teen and adult builders who travel from all corners of the US and from several countries around the world to display their LEGO models or MOCs ('My Own Creations') at the exhibition.
