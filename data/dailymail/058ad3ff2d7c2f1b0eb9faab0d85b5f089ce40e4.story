A furious bidding war for the Hollywood film rights to the British publishing phenomenon of the year has broken out – even before the book has been released.

Us by David Nicholls is already the most hotly awaited novel of the year. His last book, One Day, sold an astonishing five million copies - including two million in Britain alone - after its publication in 2009.

The first ever glimpse of Us will be revealed in this weekend’s Mail on Sunday, with an exclusive 8,500-word extract in a special issue of You magazine. It sets up the plot of a couple and their teenage son touring Europe as they attempt to salvage their crumbling marriage – a storyline that was inspired by Nicholls’ own experience of promoting One Day five years ago.

Booksellers expect huge demand for the novel, which is predicted to top best seller lists around the world when it is published by Hodder & Stoughton on September 30 – and now Mail Online can reveal that Russell Crowe is among the Hollywood A-listers locked in a battle for the film rights.

One Day was adapted into a film in 2011 starring Anne Hathaway and Jim Sturgess as lovers whose relationship was charted on the same date over several years.

Nicholls last night confirmed to MailOnline that there was interest in a film version of his new novel. ‘Yes, there has been talk about that. Of course I would love it to have another life like One Day.’

Gladiator star Crowe is reported to want to both produce and star in the adaptation.

A leading British film producer said: ‘I am putting in for the book and so is everybody else I know. There is a great deal of interest in it and some of Hollywood’s biggest stars including Crowe believe it could be the ideal vehicle for them.’

Another industry source said: ‘A number of production companies are already taking an active interest.’ Explaining that a film is inevitable, the source added: ‘It’s not a question of if, it’s a question of when.’

In Us, middle-aged scientist Douglas Peterson is married to Connie, who was once the love of his life. Now, though, it appears their marriage is all but over.

In one last attempt to rekindle their love they take a trip across Europe with their rebellious teenage son Albie in tow.

The book follows the mismatched trio on their adventures in Paris, Amsterdam, Munich, Venice, Florence, Sienna, Madrid and Barcelona.

Each destination on the trip triggers a memory of happier times - and all three members of the family must question whether they have a future together.

Experts believe the story will have widespread appeal and could be a break-out hit among older audiences - like Best Exotic Marigold Hotel which starred Dames Judi Dench and Maggie Smith, and Bill Nighy.

One insider said: ‘You have got three brilliant lead characters and it’s a perfect film for an older demographic.’

Sources close to the book say Nicholls has told interested parties he doesn’t even want to sit down for detailed talks until October.

He is known to have a close working relationship with BBC Films, the Corporation’s feature film division, and another collaboration with them is a distinct possibility.

Nicholls has just adapted a big screen adaptation of Far From The Madding Crowd for the BBC which stars Carey Mulligan and will be released next year.

Friends say Nicholls is unlikely to adapt the film himself following what is said to be his unhappy experience on the 2011 adaptation of One Day. The movie took a respectable $70 million at the box office but some fans were unhappy with the casting of Hathaway as the book’s Yorkshire heroine.

Although not yet published, Us has already been recognised with a place among the 13 books on the Booker Prize longlist - unlike Martin Amis, who missed out with his new novel The Zone Of Interest. Nicholls’ fans are eagerly awaiting the announcement of the shortlist on Tuesday to see if Us has been chosen as one of the final six.
