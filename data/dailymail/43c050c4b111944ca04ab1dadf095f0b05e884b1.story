We all remember the controversial Facebook campaign Women Who Eat on Tubes, the fat-shaming fad in which users uploaded anonymous pictures of women munching away on public transport, sparking outrage amongst women, feminists and TFL alike.

However it seems that no matter what your size, you can come under fire - as a new Instagram trend dubbed 'thin shaming' proves.

You Did Not Eat That was set up in April by an anonymous user and regrams images of slender women posing with fatty foods with the hashtag #youdidnoteatthat (YDNET) - and has already gained a following of 96,576 people.

Claiming these women are simply using the food as accessories, its tag line reads: 'Speaking the truth in this mixed up world of too many macaroons and ice cream cones used as props. Because really... Youdidnoteatthat'.

The account's creator said she began the project because she was sick of seeing staged photos of women with thigh-gaps posing with almighty slices of pizza and thought it was about time someone called them up on it.

Recalling one particular instance that made her blood boil, she told New York magazine: 'A month ago I saw dozens of bloggers swarming a dessert table, taking pictures and spending five minutes merchandizing the sunglasses next to the macaroons. Then they walked away and nothing was eaten. It was so contrived!'

Despite being adamant that her account is all in good humour, YDNET has been met with severe criticism, with many claiming that it will only encourages stigmas around food.

Therapist Rachel Morris says that there could be something far deeper behind the desire to document a diet of high-fat foods. She worries that the reason for the photos could be Liarexia, whereby women order huge portions of food when out with others, but dramatically restrict their portions in private.

'Liarexia can be a form of eating disorder,' says Rachel, 'It's connected to feeling shame around food and it's often sparked by fear of being challenged by other people.'

Despite this worrying information, YDNET's creator insists that she is not targeting women, she simply wants to see a bit more honesty.

'This is not me making some huge social commentary about what size somebody is and what they're eating. This is more like, Come on, we see the formula. You look awesome! Don't lie about how you got there! It's fine.'

YDNET has received a backlash from several bloggers such as Sincerley Jules and Emily Schuman from Cupcakes and Cashmere, who blocked her account after being named and shamed.
