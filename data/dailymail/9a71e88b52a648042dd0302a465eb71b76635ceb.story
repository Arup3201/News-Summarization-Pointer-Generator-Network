Thousands of anti-government protesters took to the streets across Syria today after a televised appearance by President Bashar Assad, shouting for him to step down.

Security forces opened fire in the central city of Homs, killing at least one person.

Crowds there and in several other cities were angered by Assad's remarks on TV and taunted him with warnings that his regime would be the next to unravel, as Muammar Gaddafi's 42-year rule was crumbling under a rebel advance in Libya.

President Assad, pictured delivering a televised speech on Sunday, has insisted he is not concerned about security in his country

Human rights groups say more than 2,200 people have been killed in the government's crackdown on a five-month-old uprising.

The regime has unleashed tanks and snipers in an attempt to stamp out the revolt.

In a now-familiar refrain, Assad on Sunday promised imminent reforms - including parliamentary elections by February - but insisted the unrest was being driven by armed gangs and Islamic militants, not true reform seekers.

He also said he was not worried about security in his country and warned against any Libya-style foreign military intervention.

Seemingly spurred by the imminent toppling of Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi, rebels are taunting the Syrian President (pictured here alongside Gaddafi in 2005) that his regime will be the next to fall

An urgent session of the U.N. Human Rights Council began in Geneva today, which saw the U.S., the E.U. and Arab nations call for an international inquiry into atrocities by Syrian government forces

The United States, the European Union (EU) and Arab nations have demanded an international inquiry into atrocities by Syrian government forces.    

An initial United Nations investigation said the government's five-month crackdown on opposition demonstrators -- marked by killings, disappearances and torture - may amount to crimes against humanity. 

‘We have credible allegations, documented evidence, that Assad has used tanks, machine guns, grenades and snipers against peaceful protesters and human rights defenders. Innocent civilians are being massacred,’ U.S. ambassador Eileen Chamberlain Donahoe told reporters in Geneva today.   

Faysal Khabbaz Hamoui, Syrian ambassador to the U.N. in Geneva, is set to defend his government at the 47-member forum, whose session was delayed by technical problems and is likely to carry over to tomorrow.     

U.S. President Barack Obama has called for Assad to step down because of the crackdown, in which the United Nations says around 2,200 civilians have died.   

'It is clear that Assad is isolated and I think that today's session will underscore that point,' Donahoe said.

'We see an emerging consensus in the international community, there is growing unity and resolve that Assad must go.'   

A draft resolution presented by some 25 members, including all four Arab members (Jordan, Kuwait, Qatar and Saudi Arabia) as well as non-member Tunisia, would set up an international commission of inquiry on alleged crimes against humanity.

It would report back by the end of November and its findings would be sent to the U.N. Secretary-General and 'relevant bodies'.   

His remarks appeared designed to portray confidence as the regime comes under  international condemnation.

Syria's state-run news agency said Assad formed a committee to pave the way for the formation of political groups other than his Baath party, which has held a monopoly in Syria for decades.

The opposition rejected Assad's remarks, saying they have lost confidence in his promises of reform while his forces open fire on peaceful protesters.

Thousands of people across several Syrian cities took to the streets after the interview.

In the flashpoint central city of Homs, a hotbed of dissent against the regime, protesters shouted that Assad will follow Gaddafi, whose whereabouts was unknown as rebels claimed to be in control of Libya's capital.

'Gaddafi is gone, now it's your turn Bashar!' they shouted.

Syria granted a U.N. team permission to visit some of the centres of the protests and crackdown to assess humanitarian needs, but activists and a Western diplomat have accused the regime of trying to scrub away signs of the crackdown.

In Hama, another central city that has been a hotbed of dissent, pro-regime gunmen fired their guns in celebration after Assad's appearance, killing two people overnight.

The head of Jordan's largest opposition group says the imminent toppling of Colonel Gaddafi is a lesson for the rulers of Syria and Yemen.

Muslim Brotherhood leader Hammam Saeed says Arabs should celebrate Gaddafi's ouster because it paves the way for democracy in the north African nation.

Saeed described Gaddafi as a 'tyrant who used unjustified force against his people, just like the Yemeni and Syrian presidents, who should draw lessons that their end is near and would be similar.'
