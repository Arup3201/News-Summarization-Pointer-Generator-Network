A dog who had its front paws cut off by callous members of a Mexican drug gang is able to play and run once more after being fitted with prosthetic legs.

The sweetly-named Pay de Limon - or Lemon Pie - was discovered whining and bleeding in a dumpster after its run-in with heartless criminals in Mexico City in 2011.

A year on the plucky pooch has recovered well thanks to the efforts of the Milagros Caninos - Canine Miracles - rescue centre in the Mexican capital, which raised almost £4,000 to pay for Pay de Limon's new legs.

The founder of the rescue shelter claimed Pay de Limon's horrifying injuries were the work of criminals using the dog to 'practice' the torturous treatments dished out to kidnap victims by members of Mexico's notorious drug cartels.

'Pay de Limon had the misfortune of running into an organised crime group and they used him to practice cutting off each one of his paws, like they do when they cut fingers off human beings that have been kidnapped,' Patricia Ruiz told Reuters.

Kidnaps are a regular occurrence in 
Mexico, with victims snatched by drug gangs to try and extort money from
 their families, or sometimes to be forced into working for the cartels.

The mutilated dog was brought to 
Milagros Caninos after being found abandoned in a dumpster by passersby 
in the Fresnillo district of Mexico City.

Staff at the rescue shelter worked to
 nurse Pay de Limon back to health, and raised more than $6,000 in 
donations to pay for the prosthetic limbs that would allow him to walk 
again.

Because no facilities exist in Mexico
 for fitting dogs with prosthetic legs, moulds of Pay de Limon's legs 
were sent to a company in Colorado, U.S., that specialises in braces and
 prosethetics for dogs and other animals.

As Pay de Limon grew accustomed to 
wearing the prosthetics the dog gradually spent more time each day 
wearing them, and staff say it now regularly trots around with the help of its new legs.

Mexico has been plagued by violence since President Felipe Calderon declared war on the country's drug cartels in 2006.

At least 47,000 people are believed to have died since government troops were sent in to gang strongholds in the country six years ago.
