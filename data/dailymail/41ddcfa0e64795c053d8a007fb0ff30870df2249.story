Three Watertown police officers have recalled their chaotic gun battle with the Boston bombers four days after the explosions that killed three people and injured 264.

Testifying at Dzhokhar Tsarnaev's trial on Monday, the officers also recounted the terrifying moment he raced towards them in his getaway car - but fatally struck his older brother, Tamerlan, as he fled.

The brothers fired a gun at three police officers and hurled bombs at them, including one that was similar to the devices used in the April 15, 2013 attack, the officers testified.

Watertown Police patrolman John Reynolds recalled chasing the brothers in two cars hours after they allegedly shot and killed a police officer in nearby Cambridge, and having a large bomb thrown at him and a colleague as they tried to arrest the Tsarnaevs.

Getting a close look: The jury visited the bullet-ridden boat where he was found in April 2013

'My ears were ringing, I could hear all the car alarms going off for many blocks around us, there was a huge cloud of smoke,' he testified in court in Boston. 'I could feel all the debris landing on me.'

The gun battle continued for eight minutes, he said,

'It felt like there were hundreds of rounds,' he said. 'It was non-stop.'

The jury saw a photo taken during the gun battle, showing two people that Watertown Police Sergeant John MacClellan identified as the Tsarnaev brothers, crouching in front of a black Mercedes during the gunfight, which played out on a street tightly packed with houses.

James Foley, who lived on the block, testified that he was sleeping in the living room of his home with his three-week-old son when he was awakened by gunshots.

'I looked outside and I could see guns firing,' Foley said. 'I didn't look for long. I saw that it was pretty serious and I wanted to get my kid back upstairs to the back of his house and into his crib.'

Reynolds, MacClellan and a third officer, Sergeant Jeff Pugliese, attempted to tackle Tamerlan, who was a trained martial artist.

As they struggled to handcuff him, Dzhokhar sped towards them in the black Mercedes that the brothers had carjacked. Reynolds said he heard the engine revving.

Found: Investigators work near a boat in Watertown, Massachusetts the day after Dzhokhar Tsarnaev was found hiding inside in April 2013. On Monday, the jury in his death penalty trial visited the boat

'Get off! Get off! He's coming back toward us!' he recalled himself shouting.

He fired and hit the windshield as Dzhokhar drove towards them but he didn't stop. An officer tried to pull Tamerlan out of the way but couldn't, ABC reported.

'Tamerlan was run over by the Mercedes,' Reynolds said.

Sergeant John MacLellan added: 'It was very violent. The car was jumping back and forth with the body stuck up under the wheels.'

Tamerlan was not immediately killed by his injuries and Reynolds testified it was still a struggle for him and a second officer to handcuff him after Dzhokhar drove off. He died later that day.

Dzhokhar briefly escaped, ditching the car and hiding in a drydocked boat in a backyard.

Reynolds also testified about the moment he came across the two men days after the bombings and after they had killed an MIT campus security officer.

He was on patrol at 12.38am when he saw a vehicle that matched the description of the car involved in that shooting.

'He was driving slow, very suspicious,' Reynolds told the court. 'We locked eyes.'

The car stopped and Tamerlan got out before pulling out a weapon on Reynolds, he testified. The police officer ducked and reversed - and then came the eight-minute gun battle.

Ahead of the testimony, the jurors visited the boat where Tsarnaev was found. Tsarnaev, flanked by three attorneys and U.S. marshals, watched impassively from a table 50 feet away.

The group then went two at a time onto a lift so they could look inside the vessel, which was on a trailer, to see the notes he scrawled on the walls before he was taken into custody on April 19, 2013.

The red and white boat, the Slipaway II, was dry-docked in a yard in Watertown when he climbed inside. It is now covered with more than 100 bullet holes each marked with white evidence tape. 

In his notes written in pencil, Tsarnaev denounced the U.S. for its wars in Muslim countries. The note is speckled with at least 10 bullet holes and stained with long streaks of blood.

Hideout: Tsarnaev, then 19, can be seen emerging from the boat after he was found on April 19, 2013

Final words: Inside the boat, he wrote a series of notes, which the jury saw Monday. This note, punctured with bullets, explains how he is jealous of his brother Tamerlan because he had died and gone to paradise

The notes also denounced the U.S. for its wars in Muslim countries. Last week, the jury heard how all the bullets that made holes in the side of the boat were shot from outside the vessel as he hid inside

'We Muslims are one body you hurt one you hurt us all,' Tsarnaev scrawled, citing what it said was aggression in Muslim lands.

'We are promised victory and we will surely get it. Now I don't like killing innocent people it is forbidden in islam... but due to said [blank] it is allowed.'

'The US Government is killing our innocent civilians but most of you already know that. As a [unintelligible] I can't stand to see such evil go unpunished. We Muslims are one body, you hurt one you hurt us all. Well at least that's how muhhammad (pbuh) wanted it to be [for]ever. The ummah is beginning to rise. [Unintelligible] has awoken the mujahideen. Know you are fighting men who look into the barrel of your gun and see heaven, now how can you compete with that. We are promised victory and we will surely get it. Now I don't like killing innocent people it is forbidden in Islam but due to said [unintelligible] it is allowed. All credit goes [unintelligible]. Stop killing our innocent people and we will stop.' 

'I'm jealous of my brother who ha[s] [re]ceived the reward of jannutul Firdaus (inshallah) before me. I do not mourn because his soul is very much alive. God has a plan for each person. Mine was to hide in this boat and shed some light on our actions. I ask Allah to make me a shahied to allow me to return to him and be among all the righteous people in the highest levels of heaven. He who Allah guides no one can misguide. A[llah Ak]bar!'

A word was missing from the message due to a bullet hole.

In a separate, blood-covered note, he wrote that he was jealous of his older brother because he was dead and in paradise.

'God has a plan for each person,' he wrote. 'Mine was to hide in this boat and shed some light on our actions.' 

Last week, Todd Brown, a Boston police bomb technician, testified that he saw the writing inside the boat when he was sent to check it to make sure there were no explosives or booby traps on board.  

During cross-examination of Brown, Tsarnaev's lawyers established that all the bullet holes were from shots coming into the boat when police fired. The officer said no bombs, guns or weapons of any kind were found inside the boat.

One of the boat's two front windows is shot out almost completely, with just one shattered piece of glass remaining.

Tsarnaev is on trial for planning and carrying out the April 15, 2013 bombings and faces the death penalty if convicted. 

Three people were killed and more than 260 were injured when two bombs exploded near the Boston marathon finish line.

The blasts killed restaurant manager Krystle Campbell, 29, graduate student Lingzi Lu, 23, and eight-year-old Martin Richard, who was at the marathon with his family.

Massachusetts Institute of Technology police officer Sean Collier, 27, was shot dead three days later as the Tsarnaev brothers fled authorities. 

After the bombings, the brothers carjacked a man and hurled explosives at police during a shootout that ended when Dzhokhar roared off in a car, running over and killing his brother before disappearing into the dry-docked boat in the Boston suburb of Watertown.

Police found him the next evening, after a day-long lockdown of the Boston area when hundreds of thousands of people hid in their homes. 

Tsarnaev's lawyer admitted during opening statements of his trial that he participated in the bombings and the later crimes, but said his slain older brother, Tamerlan, was the mastermind who recruited the then 19-year-old Dzhokhar to help him.

But prosecutors say Tsarnaev was a full and willing participant. Now 21, he faces the possibility of the death penalty if convicted.

The same jury that decides guilt will decide whether he receives life in prison or the death penalty.

The trial began its third week on Monday. It had been expected to last three to four months but is moving faster than anticipated, largely because the defense has not cross-examined many witnesses.
