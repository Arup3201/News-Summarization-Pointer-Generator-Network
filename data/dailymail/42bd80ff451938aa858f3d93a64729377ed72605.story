Milton Brown has been released after serving 14 years in prison for attacking two women

A rapist who subjected his victims to a five-day ordeal in the witness box has been freed early after serving just 14 years.

Milton Brown, now 57, was jailed in January 1998 for a total of 21 years for savage attacks on three women, including former girlfriend Susan McDonald – who went on to kill herself.

At his trial at the Old Bailey, Brown defended himself, spending five days cross-examining Ms 
McDonald and another victim about the savage attacks.

After the trial it emerged he had 58 convictions for violence, dishonesty and sexual offences, including child molestation, spanning 29 years.

Now he has been spotted back on the streets where he carried out his campaign of terror after serving just two thirds of his sentence.

Miss McDonald, then 29, was held captive for three months by crack addict Milton Brown in his barred and padlocked flat in Camberwell, south London.

He repeatedly beat her with a pool cue and a plank studded with nails.

She was left with a broken arm and covered from head to toe in bruises. Her injuries left her on crutches for four months.

At the trial he was said to have carried out a 'merciless cross-examination clearly designed only to intimidate and humiliate them'.

Making use of his rights as he conducted his own defence, Brown questioned them for several days, forcing them to read out long, intimate passages from their statements.

So great was the public outcry over their ordeal that the law was changed to prevent rapists questioning their alleged victims in court.

In court Judge Leo Charles QC told Brown: 'You lack the factor that distinguishes man from beast, namely humanity.'

Brown was jailed for five years for causing grievous bodily harm to Miss McDonald, which came on top of he 16 years he was given for the triple knifepoint rape of a 38-year-old widow, Sandra Summers, and indecent assault on a neuroscientist aged 31.

Mrs Summers, who waived her right to anonymity, said at the time: 'I cannot understand how the British justice system has allowed me to be put through this. I was raped again, emotionally, inside that witness box.'

She had been held in Brown’s flat for 15 hours and raped three times at knifepoint.

A detective in the case described Brown as 'the most evil man I have ever come across'.

In May 2004, Ms McDonald was found dead in her flat in West Norwood, south London, surrounded by empty pill bottles.

Susan's mother Sandra, 62, told the Sun she was not even tipped off Brown had been let out on probation after serving two-thirds of his sentence.

She said yesterday: 'It's an insult. Susan never recovered from what he did to her. There is nothing stopping my other daughter or Susan's son from bumping into him.'

Brown has been given his own flat in Tottenham, north London, which the council is believed to be paying for.

The Sun reported seeing him cycling unmonitored around the capital - including weekly trips to Camberwell to check in with probation.

Brown said he deserved to be free. 'I've changed,' he told The Sun.

The Justice Ministry insisted: ‘Serious sex offenders released from prison are closely supervised.’
