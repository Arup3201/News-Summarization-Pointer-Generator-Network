Honey Boo Boo’s mom June Shannon is facing intense scrutiny over her supposed rekindled relationship with child molester Mark McDaniel, but he isn't the first sex offender she has dated.

Michael Anthony Ford, 37, also dated Mama June and is the father of her 17-year-old daughter Jessica 'Chubbs' Shannon.

After the pair split he served over two years in prison for the sexual exploitation of a child over the internet in 2005 and remains on the sex offender registry.

According to prison records, Ford is currently behind bars on a separate child abandonment charge.

The fathers of Shannon’s other children also have criminal records but rather than being sex-related their crimes included arson and burglary.

Alana’s father, David Michael ‘Sugar Bear’ Thompson, was sentenced to five years in 1998 for robbing a series of campsites and setting fire to another.

Anna’s father, David Dunn, did time in 1995 for stealing a handgun and again in 1998 for stealing a carton of cigarettes. The father of Laury is said to be unknown, even by Mama June.

A police report has revealed the sickening sexual assaults Mama June's eldest daughter allegedly suffered at the hands of her boyfriend when she was just eight. 

The March 2003 report, seen by RadarOnline, reveals how Anna 'Chickadee' Shannon told authorities in Spalding County, Georgia that she had done the 'S word' with Mark McDaniel.

She also told police that her mother's boyfriend touched her inappropriately, made her touch him inappropriately and forced her to perform a sex act on him. When she told him to stop, he would not.

Anna, who appeared on 'Here Comes Honey Boo Boo' with her mother and siblings, has since revealed that when she first told her mother about the abuse, Mama June refused to believe her.

McDaniel was sentenced to 10 years behind bars after pleading guilty to child molestation. He left prison in March and has reportedly been seeing Mama June again.

Attacked: Anna 'Chickadee' Shannon, pictured with her husband Michael in 2013, was repeatedly abused by her mother's boyfriend between April and October 2002, a police report has shown

The abuse came to light after Anna told her elementary school teacher that her stepfather had assaulted her. She was able to describe the assaults in graphic detail, the report notes.

The molestation was carried out multiple times between April and October 2002, according to the report. 

It took Anna months to speak out about the abuse because McDaniel had threatened to kill her if she told, RadarOnline reported.

'Anna stated that Mark told her not to tell because he would not like her anymore,' Beach continued. 'Anna advised she got tired of holding it in and had to tell.'

Speaking to the National Enquirer in 2012, Anna's ex-boyfriend said: 'Anna told me that McDaniel threatened that if she ever told her grandparents what happened to her, he’d kill them and her.'

Should Mama June lose custody of her kids?

In June 2003, McDaniel was indicted for child molestation, aggravated child molestation and aggravated sexual battery in Henry County but the case was soon dropped. 

He was then indicted in Spalding County for rape, child molestation, aggravated child molestation, enticing a child for indecent purposes and aggravated sexual battery. 

Grand jurors accused McDaniel of showing Anna sexually graphic videos, fondling and sexually assaulting the girl, RadarOnline reported.

As part of a plea deal, McDaniel only plead guilty to aggravated child molestation and was sentenced to 10 years.

Anna, who is now 20 and married with a two-year-old daughter, revealed to People magazine that when she told her mother what McDaniel had done to her, June did not believe her.

'A week or so after it happened, I talked to Mama and she was upset, crying and saying, "I don't believe you, I don't believe you, why would you do this to me?"' she remembered.

'And I was like, "Mama, he did that to me and I can't do anything about it. You were never there to see it. You were always at work".'

After the assault, she moved to her grandmother's house and she only returned to live with her mother shortly before Here Comes Honey Boo Boo began, People reported.

'Me and Mama realized we needed to put this behind us and get our relationship back on track and that's what we did and that's what we have been doing,' she said. 

She said she doesn't know whether to believe reports that her mother is back together with McDaniel but, if it is true, 'I'm hurt'. 

Mama June has denied that she is dating the child molester.

'The statement of me dating a sex offender is totally untrue,' she said in a video posted at the weekend. 'I would not ever, ever, ever, ever put my kids in danger.' 

Moving on: Anna, left with her husband and right with their daughter, said she is hurt by reports that her mother could be back together with her abuser - and that they will not be allowed to come near her child

But photographs show June and McDaniel looking for houses in Griffin last month, while another image shows him touching her daughter, Alana 'Honey Boo Boo' Shannon, who is just nine.

Despite her protests, TLC has announced that they were cancelling the series because of Shannon's relationship with McDaniel.

A friend of Alana's father, Mike 'Sugar Bear' Thompson, told MailOnline that he is gearing up for a custody battle after learning that Mama June has allowed McDaniel to come into contact with her.

On Monday, RadarOnline reported that Child Protective Services in Georgia have opened an investigation into whether any crimes have been committed involving Mama June's three minor children - Alana, Lauryn 'Pumpkin' Shannon, 14 and Jessica 'Chubbs', 17.
