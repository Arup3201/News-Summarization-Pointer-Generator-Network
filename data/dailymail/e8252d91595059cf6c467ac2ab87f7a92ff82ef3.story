David Cameron issued a stinging rebuke to Tory MP Zac Goldsmith when he forced a Government U-turn on new planning laws.

The Prime Minister vented his fury after being given no choice but to climb down over proposals aiming to make it easier to build home extensions without planning permission.

‘Who does that man think he’s accountable to?’ Mr Cameron raged when Mr Goldsmith went back on a pledge to Ministers and led a Tory revolt in the Commons.

Anti plan: Zac Goldsmith, Conservative MP, voted against the law which would have doubled the length of extensions that people can build in their gardens without planning permission

It is the latest in a series of increasingly acrimonious rows between the two Old Etonians who were once close allies and friends.

Last year, Mr Goldsmith accused Mr Cameron of capitulating to big business over genetically modified crops. Speaking after the Prime Minister urged the EU to allow more GM crops in Britain, Mr Goldsmith said: ‘The PM could have studied GM and changed his view, but it looks more like political deception.’

Last summer, The Mail on Sunday revealed how Mr Goldsmith, a  multi-millionaire, offered to give up his Commons seat of Richmond Park & North Kingston, Surrey, to allow Boris Johnson to make a Parliamentary comeback.

Mr Goldsmith had also said Tory plans to do a U-turn on building a third runway at Heathrow would be an ‘unbearable betrayal’ for his  constituents under the flight path.

Angry: David Cameron has hit out at Tory MP Zac Goldsmith

The latest row blew up after Mr Goldsmith led the fight against Coalition plans to let homeowners build 26ft extensions in their gardens without needing planning permission.

Ministers yesterday bowed to the protests and unveiled a revised scheme whereby property owners will still have to notify their local council about extensions that size. 

Tory sources claim before the key Commons vote earlier last week, Communities Secretary Eric Pickles had told Mr Goldsmith that he would compromise on the plans and received a promise from the MP that he would therefore not vote against the Government.

One source said: ‘Despite that, Zac went ahead and voted against us. It’s outrageous.’

It is a far cry from before the Election when Mr Goldsmith, 38, won a place on the Tories’ coveted ‘A-list’ of elite parliamentary candidates.

A former editor of the Ecologist magazine, he also served as Mr Cameron’s green adviser.

Mr Goldsmith is said to have inherited up to £300 million from his late father Sir James Goldsmith.

The Tory source added: ‘Before the Election, Cameron put him on the A-list and fast-tracked him into the Commons.

'This is how he repays him but then, I suppose if you’re worth as much as he is, he feels he can do what he wants.’

The MP was unavailable for comment but a friend said: ‘Zac is accountable to his constituents.

'They matter to him more than anything else.

'He never promised not to vote against the Government.'
