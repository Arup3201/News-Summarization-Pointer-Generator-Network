Unwanted: Pesky pythons released into the wild by misanthropic pet owners are ravaging south Florida's ecosystem by apparently eating everything in sight

Release the hounds!

Florida officials plan to host an ole'-fashioned snake hunt - intended to root out the state's population of ravenous Burmese pythons, which is ravaging the Everglades by eating everything in sight.

The great 'Python challenge' of 2013 is open any wrangler with the $25 contest fee, the 30 minutes necessary to complete an online course, and the stomach to tromp through a reedy landscape in search of carnivorous snakes that can grow to as big as 18 feet in length.

'Whichever method they use, hunters have an ethical obligation to dispatch the snake as humanely as possible,' Carli Segelson, a spokeswoman for the Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission, told FoxNews.com.

Nearly 400 hardy souls have already enlisted in the unorthodox, month-long competition, which begins Jan. 12.Â  Its rules mandate that hunters leave the captured pythons at official drop-off sites within 24 hours of their being caught.

'We are also using the Challenge to gauge the effectiveness of using an incentive-based model as one tool to address a challenging invasive species management problem,' Segelson reoportedly said.

Burmese pythons are not thought to be dangerous to humans, although larger specimens can conceivably overwhelm an adult

But not everyone thinks such a bizarre solution to Florida's pesky python problem is in the state, the snakes', or the hunters' best interests.

'Despite what has been portrayed in popular reality television shows, the Burmese pythons in the Everglades can be extremely dangerous when provoked,' Melissa Coakley, a spokeswoman for the Florida-based Suncoast Herpetological Society, told FoxNews.com.

'It takes a great deal of hands-on practice before one is able to master the art of catching and safely handling large constrictors. There is also the danger of hunters unwittingly killing native snakes while in the Everglades.'

Coakley added the contest, complete with a $1,500 cash prize for the largest wrangled constrictor, might convince some clever participants to merely purchase a python out-of-state on the cheap - and then submit it as one captured in the Everglades.

However, the FWC reportedly said it will put an unspecified number of game wardens on the ground in the Everglades region to ensure hunters are following the rules, as well as, staying safe.

FoxNews.com reports that Burmese pythons are generally not dangerous to humans because the snakes are often afraid of their greater height.

Still, the website reports that snakes are capable of killing a child and some experts say the larger pythons could even overpower - and kill - an adult in certain circumstances. The Burmese python kills by squeezing its prey, then swallowing it.

All American Gator, which harvests wild alligators for use in clothing, accessories and furniture, reportedly has said it will buy larger pythons captured during the hunt.

'Aside from the obvious goal of reducing the Burmese python population in the Everglades,' Segelson reportedly said, 'we also hope to educate the public about Burmese pythons in Florida and how people can help limit the impact of this and other invasive species in Florida.'

Florida's python problem apparently stems from a few misanthropes who once harbored the snakes as pets - but then released them into the wild. The snakes typically feed on the Everglades' indigenous populations of raccoons, deer and bobcats.

For its part, FoxNews.com reports there could be as many as tens of thousands of the snakes residing in the Everglades.
