Last year it was the advert that warmed the hearts of football fans across the country.

The uplifting Budweiser commercial portraying the lost dog and its Clydesdale horse friend was played during the Super Bowl - as it has done for nearly three decades.

Now the beer company are doing the same again - and teasers from the newest installment give the impression it could be a tearjerker 

Concern: Teasers for the new Super Bowl advert released by Budweiser show a dog's owner putting up 'Lost Dog' signs on the lampost

Covered: The dog, which featured in last year's commercial, is then seen hiding under piles of hay 

GIFS released ahead of the advert's airing on February 1 show the dog hiding in rain-soaked boxes and sneaking through doors 

A picture then posted on Twitter shows the owner putting up 'Lost Dog' posters. 

The Clydesdale horse also features, bucking up and commiserating the owner who his pining for the missing animal. 

Last year the commercial showed a puppy constantly escaping the fence surrounding its owners house and running to see a clyesdale horse in adjoining stables.

After constantly infuriating its owner, the pair are eventually united in a field.

Budweiser vice president Brian Perkins told US Weekly: 'The Budweiser Clydesdales have appeared in our Super Bowl ads for nearly three decades. 

'This year, they will live up to their reputation and once again save the day in a heartwarming story about best buds never letting you down.'
