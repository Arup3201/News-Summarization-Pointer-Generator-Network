Country kids are taking over the big city, with chief executives categorised well above 10 per cent in rural areas, new data shows.

The Market Index found 21 of Australia's CEOs in the top 100 companies were born and raised in regional towns, including Bathurst, Broken Hill, Tamworth, Dubbo, Mount Isa and many more.

The list of high profile luminaries featured Woolworths Grant O'Brien from Tasmania's Burnie, BlueScope Steel's Paul O'Malley, born in NSW's Dubbo and Fortescue Metal's Neville Power, a banana bender from far north Queensland's Mount Isa and DuluxGroup  Patrick Houlihan who grew up on a dairy farm in Victoria, according toSydney Morning Herald.

The number of country-born bosses have questioned how country kids are rising to the top with almost a quarter of the nations top CEO's grew up in rural areas. 

Korn Ferry CEO Katie Lahey told Sydney Morning Herald that those who grew up in the country tend to be excellent at 'managing and getting on with people'.

'The lowest person in the shearer's shed knows the top grazer. If you are a leader, you have to feel comfortable with people at all levels.

Ms Lahey added that a propensity to travel and the ability to talk to people of all levels of society were key characteristics of country people which translated well to management.

'If you have been through seven years of drought, the chances are you've got a bit of backbone,' Ms Lahey told Sydney Morning Herald.

'Children from the country have to come to the city to further their education or start even earlier at boarding school, so already they have left home and learnt about being independent. It also gives you that mobility factor which is so important for CEOs.'

Another prime example is Fortescue Metal CEO Neville Power, 55, who was raised on a Queensland cattle station and was home schooled until he was 12. He left school at the age of 15 before he did an apprenticeship as a diesel fitter, according to the Australian Financial Review.

With his farm upbringing, Mr Power's butchering skills has benefit  both his resourcefulness and his uniqueness as a CEO.
