Suicide: Wendy Harries, 39, had been targeted by a mystery person over Facebook and email for two years before she committed suicide

A woman hanged herself six weeks after receiving a voodoo doll from an anonymous stalker, an inquest heard.

Wendy Harries, 39, had been targeted by a mystery person over Facebook and email for two years before she committed suicide.

She was harassed ‘every couple of days’ with strange messages that started by telling her where she had been and what she was doing.

The mother-of-three became so paranoid she put extra bolts on her garden gate and ensured she always locked the doors when at home, the inquest heard.

Miss Harries, an infant school teaching assistant, received a voodoo doll through the post on December 12 last year as did her former-boyfriend Steve Cock.

She was found hanging at her house in Poole, Dorset, on January 28 this year.

Mr Cock told the inquest: 'Early in 2010 she started to get odd emails from unknown sources trying to split us up.

'One of the emails said they’d seen her out in Poole when she was on a hen party and we were seen out together on the harbour front.

'It seemed like we were being watched.'

Susan Austin, Miss Harries’ best friend, said the messages were disturbing.

She said: 'She was getting them all the time, every couple of days, she locked the doors straight away behind her and put extra locks and bolts on the back gate.'

No one has been prosecuted over the messages despite a police investigation.

Detective Inspector Rebecca Riggs, from Bournemouth CID, said: 'Sadly, the police have not been able to identify anyone responsible for sending the communications to Miss Harries.

'Therefore this will be filed as undetected.'

The Bournemouth inquest heard that Miss Harries had also been distressed after her son went to live with ex-husband Mark Harries.

Sheriff Payne, the Bournemouth, Poole and East Dorset, said there was insufficient evidence to tie the harassment to Miss Harries’ death.

He said: 'There is not a clear enough or recent enough link to suggest she decided to take her own life because of this.

'I think there were other things going on that persuaded her that her life was not worth living.'

He recorded a verdict of suicide.
