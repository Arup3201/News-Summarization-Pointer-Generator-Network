A pit bull puppy that was horrifically tortured by having both ears and its right hind leg cut off, is hoping to be given a new lease of life thanks to a prosthetic limb.

The now seven-month-old puppy, named 'Miss Harper', was found riddled with injuries in September and taken in by the Nassau County Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals.

Since then, the 'sweet' natured dog has been receiving care at My Pets Vet in Huntington.

Tortured: Miss Harper was found with both ears missing and her right hind leg cut off

Despite her obvious disability, Miss Harper happily runs and plays just like any other dog, but practice manager Donna Kramer believes she may be a good candidate for receiving an artificial leg.

She told WCBS 880: 'We’re going to look to get her a 
prosthetic now to see if that’s something that she can live with. We 
hope that it is.'

Miss Harper's extensive injuries will require further treatment and surgeries in the months to come and the Nassau SPCA has asked for the public to help donate towards this via its website.

Nassau SPCA Detective Bob Sowers said: 'She had severe infections and needed some expensive care.

'We are asking the public and animal 
lovers to help us in our efforts to raise funds for the needed surgeries
 and care this poor puppy faces.'

The Nassau County SPCA is also hoping to find a new owner for Miss Harper, preferably someone with experience of pit bulls and who lives locally, so that she is close to the veterinary practice for her continuing treatment.

Meanwhile, the SPCA has been working with the New York State Attorney General's Office to discover who was responsible for inflicting the injuries on Miss Harper.
