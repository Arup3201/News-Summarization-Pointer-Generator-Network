An Arizona man wasn't willing to let a car that ran into him after a confrontation get away without a fight - so he jumped onto its trunk and held on for life. 

Justin Finch, 24, was caught on camera as he argued with some men in the parking lot of Zia Record Exchange in Phoenix.

After  multiple men confronted Finch, they piled into a white car and ran him over. 

In the video clip, Finch can be seen miraculously getting up and grabbing onto the trunk of the vehicle as it zoomed away.

Finch survived with just scrapes and bruises, Fox 10 reported. 

He said: 'It was shocking. 

I was scared for my life for a minute.

'I got pinched between two cars... This leg got twisted around and stuff.

'I'm like, afraid.'

The car was stopped about a half mile away from the store. 

Police let everyone goes because no one wanted to press charges. 

Instead of letting himself be flattened, Finch grabbed onto the back of the car and held on for dear life

Shaina Russell, who filmed the incident, can be heard theorizing the men in the car took something valuable from Finch.

Finch said the incident started after he was called a gay slur by one of the men and there was a physical confrontation.

One of the people from the car, 16-year-old Orlando Munoz, claims Finch was the aggressor. 

He said: 'I turned around to walk outside and he assaulted me, he picked me up and I started defending myself.' 

Finch denies he started the fight. 

He said: 'They said it was a mutual thing, but I don't think it was a mutual thing because I didn't come at them, they came at me.

'I want justice.. I really do.'
