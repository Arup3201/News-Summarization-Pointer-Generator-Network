Troubled: Jocelyn Wohl, 33, seen here in 2009, is accused of stabbing her life coach with a fork only six months after being arrested for choking her sober coach

A New York socialite and daughter of a wealthy real estate attorney is accused of stabbing her life coach with a fork in the second shocking attack against her hired help in months.

Joselyn Wohl, 33, who was arrested for choking and pulling her sober coach down a set of stairs in December, allegedly this time left a fragment of a fork in her victim's hand.

Sajjadur Rahman, 31, claims he was hired by Larry Wohl, Wohl's father, before her latest attack that came without warning while having dinner at the family's Southampton home.

'It was a defensive move. If he hadnâ€™t gotten his hand up, she would have stabbed him in the face,' Rahman's attorney Eric Richmon told the New York Post.

'Without just cause or provocation, Joselyn Wohl intentionally struck, battered and assaulted,' Rahman writes in his filing obtained by the Post.

Rahman says he was initially promised by Larry Wohl full compensation for his medical bills if he didn't go to the police.

But with that yet to happen, 'he called me,' Richman said.

He says Rahman's medical bills have tallied into the thousands of dollars and he's without work having to quit his job with the Wohl family out of fear for his life.

Late last year Heather McKean filed a lawsuit against the Wohl family following a March 5th attack that left her so badly injured she has had to have a spinal fusion to help her recovery.

McKean was hired by Joselyn's parents to help her with unspecified substance abuse issues.

In the lawsuit, McKean alleged that Joselyn pulled McKean down a set of concrete stairs in the Wohl's Hamptons mansion.

'Joselyn wanted to go out and do something not in her best interest and Heather was trying to talk her down,' McKean's lawyer Bryan Swerling told The New York Post.

'Heather began to walk up the stairs. She felt a tug on the back of her shirt and it was Joselyn attacking her.'

According to DNAinfo, McKean goes on to say that Joselyn continued the attack by choking her until she managed to break free and lock herself in a room.

Once there, McKean called police who responded to the call, but they have not included their records of the incident as part of the lawsuit.

McKean was hired by the family because of her work with Cerberus Life Management, a company that deals with addiction treatment.

The company has no known connection to the private equity firm of the same name, which is now tied into the Sandy Hook massacre coverage due to their financial ties to a popular gun manufacturer.

The specifics about the lawsuit have remained underwraps, as McKean's lawyer only said that she was seeking unspecified damages.

She reportedly needs physical therapy for leg and spinal cord injuries.

The Wohls have not released any public statements about the lawsuit.
