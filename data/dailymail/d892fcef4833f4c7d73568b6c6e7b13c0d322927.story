You need a brass neck to take on these guys.

Almost eye-to-eye with their rivals, competitors assume the stance of a lizard before a leather and metal strap is looped over their necks - then they pull.

The bizarre Goanna Pulling tradition, dating back to the 19th century, started as an ode to the goanna lizard, native to Wooli, Australia.

Now, in its 28th year of official competition, people train for years before flocking to the town to show what they're worth.

The two opponents each place their palms 
behind a white line traced on the board, and a referee puts a large 
leather belt around their heads.

As soon as he gives the signal, the two
 contestants must use their upper body strength to pull the other guy past the line and win the game.

The competitors are split into heats of weight - men's under 63kg, 63kg-82kg, 82kg-95kg, 95kg or over, and women's under 70kg and over 70kg.

Some contests last seconds, others drag on for minutes.
