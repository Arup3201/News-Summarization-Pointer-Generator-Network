The openly gay son of a Republican Congressman who refuses to change his stance against same-sex marriage is now speaking out after he had multiple interviews cancelled after he told the bookers that he would not bash his father.

Congressman Matt Salmon from Arizona has the constant support of his son, whose name is also Matt Salmon, and now the junior Salmon is speaking out against media outlets who refused him after he told them of his peaceful relationship with his father.

'I had one interview with Lawrence O'Donnell and that one was actually cancelled because they told me they had intended to be critical of him and so since I was unwilling to do so they said that maybe they could find something for me to talk about later on down the road so they cancelled that one,' Salmon told a local news station.

'People want controversy.'

Venting: Matt Salmon, the gay son of the Republican congressman of the same name, said that certain TV news programs lost interest when he said that he got along well with his father

Denials: Sources at Piers Morgan Live (left) and Lawrence O'Donnell's show (right) have both said that they chose not to book the junior Matt Salmon for other reasons, not because he refused to criticize his dad

The producers at MSNBC, which airs Mr O'Donnell's show, were not the only ones to reportedly drop Mr Salmon after they realized he would not be painting a conflict-ridden relationship.

He claimed that a similar situation occurred with the producers at CNN's Piers Morgan Live.

'They seemed very gung-ho about it and then when I was talking about how supportive I was of my father and how I was unwilling to be negative, they seemed to lose interest,' Salmon told KPNX.  

'Then all the sudden their show got jammed and they couldn't fit me in.'

Both MSNBC and CNN described a different situation when confronted about the sudden cancellation.

An MSNBC spokeswoman told Buzzfeed that 'a producer had initial conversations with Matt, like we do with many potential guests every day, but he was never formally booked for the show.'

A similar scenario was told by an unidentified source with connections to the Piers Morgan show, who told Buzzfeed: 'This  isn't accurate. The show simply booked up with other guests on a different topic. Happens all the time in cable news.'

The relationship between Matt Salmon and his politician father came under scrutiny when the Congressman said that, in spite of a growing number of flips by Republican politicians in support of same-sex marriage, he remains against the equal opportunity move.

Congressman Salmon said that even though his son is openly gay and has been for many years, he refuses to support same-sex marriage, saying that he's 'just not there'.

'As far as believing in my heart that 
we should change 2000 years of social policy in favor of a redefinition 
of the family. I'm not there,' Congressman Salmon said.

'My son is by far one of the most 
important people in my life, I love him more than I could say,' he told 
local station 3TV News.

'I don’t believe that this is a lifestyle that he chose.

'It doesn't mean that I don’t have 
respect. It doesn't mean that I don’t sympathize with some of the 
issues, it just means that I haven't evolved to that station. Rob 
Portman apparently has.'

His parents' anti-gay stance has not 
stopped the younger Matt Salmon from making his own way in state 
politics, becoming the president of the Arizona Log Cabin Republicans 
and posing for a photo shoot with his boyfriend for the Phoenix New Times.

Adding to the complicated situation in
the Salmon family is the fact that they are all devout Mormons, a faith
that bans homosexuality.

Family values: Congressman Matt Salmon (center) and his wife Nancy (center left) are firmly anti-gay but they still love their gay son Matt (far right)

At the time of the interview in 2010, 
Matt was dating Kent Flake, who also has family connections to 
Republican politicians in the state, and the pair both decided to leave 
the church because of their conflicts with their sexuality.

They received frosty welcomes from their families, who were not thrilled by the coupling.

'Everybody's pretty much told me, 
"You're fine, we love you, but your partner's not welcome because we 
don't want gay around us." And I'm like, "Well, I am gay. What if he 
doesn't act gay? Is that okay? Can he come around?"' Matt told the 
paper.

The younger Matt tells how he and his 
father have a strong relationship but recognize their differences when 
it comes to homosexuality.

'Evolved': Senator Rob Portman came out in support of same-sex marriage after he revealed that his son Will (center back) is gay

'I love my father and realize that he
can have the opinions that he has, and they might differ from mine, but
that doesn’t change the way I feel about him,' he said to The Washington Post.

'I definitely share my feelings, but I
don’t pressure him to change his opinion because I know that given our 
relationship there’s no real need to do that. We each know where we 
stand.'

Congressman Salmon's stance comes in 
stark contrast to that of Senator Rob Portman, who made waves after 
switching his personal stance from being firmly anti-gay rights to in 
support of same-sex marriage after learning that his son is gay.
