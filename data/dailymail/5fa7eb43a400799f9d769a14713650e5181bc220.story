Shane Walford killed father-of-two Paul Gibbons with a single punch outside a bar in Coventry

A convicted killer has been arrested in the Canary Islands just days after he appeared on a list of Britain's most wanted fugitives believed to be on the run in Spain.

Shane Walford was tracked down to the Canary Islands by Spanish police on Saturday morning.

The ex-soldier, 38, was jailed in 2010 for the manslaughter of an off-duty fireman while on leave from the Army.

Walford, a former boxer, killed father-of-two Paul Gibbons with a single punch outside a bar in Coventry.

He was jailed for four and a half years but was recalled to prison in August 2013 after breaking the terms of his licence.

The National Crime Agency (NCA) released the most wanted list as part of Operation Captura, which targets wanted suspects who are thought to have fled to Spain. 

An NCA spokesman said: 'Shane Walford was arrested by Spanish national police yesterday morning in the Canary Islands.'   

The nine remaining men are wanted in connection with crimes including rape, indecent assault of a child and drug trafficking, the National Crime Agency (NCA) said.

Another of the fugitives is Mohammed Jahangir Alam, 32, who was sentenced to 14 years in his absence in March 2010 for rape and sexual assault by penetration.

Alam, who is originally from Bangladesh, arrived in the UK on a temporary visa in October 2007 and moved to Cheltenham the following year, when he physically and sexually abused his victim, the NCA said.  

Also on the wanted list is 52-year-old Carlo Dawson, from Croydon, south London, who is accused of indecently assaulting a 12-year-old girl and making indecent photographs of a child.

On the run: (L-R) Carlo Dawson from south London, who is accused of indecently assaulting a 12-year-old girl and making indecent photos of a child. Jayson McDonald is a suspected drug trafficker

Also on list: (L-R) David McDermott, believed to be a member of a drug-dealing organised crime gang in Liverpool,  and youthful-looking Michael Roden, nicknamed 'Dodge' and suspected of importing cannabis

An operation was launched last week to arrest one of the fugitives, suspected drugs trafficker Jayson McDonald, who is believed to have been living in Spain.

More than a dozen armed officers along with detectives from the Metropolitan Police carried out a dawn raid on a luxury villa in Coin near Malaga but McDonald was not found.

It is the ninth appeal of its kind since Captura was launched by the NCA and Crimestoppers in 2006, and so far 65 out of 76 named suspects have been caught.

One of the latest to be found in Tenerife was drugs lord Stephen Blundell, 36, from Merseyside, who fled the UK before being sentenced for a £1 million heroin plot, the NCA said.

Hank Cole, the NCA's head of international operations, said: 'Spain is not a safe haven for British fugitives. The NCA and its partners will continue to pursue these individuals relentlessly and return them to the UK to face justice.

Wanted: (L-R) Paul Buchanan, wanted for attempted rape, and suspected drug tafficker Anthony Dennis are also National Crime Agency targets

'The exceptional level of collaboration and intelligence sharing with the Spanish authorities has been vital to these arrests. However, we still need the support of the public.

'Be our eyes and ears and tell us if you have any information on the whereabouts of our targets.'

Lord Ashcroft, founder of Crimestoppers, said: 'Operation Captura has proved a huge success since it was launched in 2006 and the majority of individuals on our most wanted list have been captured.

'However, there are still a number of criminals who are evading arrest. We must ensure these individuals are brought to justice. We are confident that we can successfully hunt them down with support from the Spanish authorities, as well as the Spanish and UK public.'

Spanish authorities are heavily backing the operation and a leading policewoman has claimed the country is no longer a 'safe place' for British criminals to hide.

Speaking at Malaga's police headquarters, Inspector Olga Lizana, head of the Spanish National Police Fugitives Unit, said British criminals living in Spain should 'leave the country' because they will be found.

She added: 'This is not a good place (for them) to come any more. This is not a safe place for criminals any more.

'I think we are doing a great job with the British authorities. They have to be aware we are working together.' 

Mohammed Jahangir Alam was sentenced to 14 years in jail in his absence for rape

Spain's Costa del Sol - once dubbed 'Costa del Crime' - has been known as a hideaway for British criminals in the past, particularly in the late 1970s and 80s when there were no extradition agreements with the UK.

Infamous British criminals to have fled to the region included Great Train robber Charlie Wilson, who was shot dead in Marbella in 1990, and Freddie Foreman, an associate of the Kray twins.

Inspector Lizana said, like most British expatriates, criminals were attracted to Spain by the 'good weather and good food.'

She added: 'There is a huge British community living here. For them, it is easy to hide. For us sometimes it is really difficult to find them.

'Also, it's a cheap country compared to the UK.'

The launch of Operation Captura in 2006 has seen an increasing number of British fugitives being captured in Spain.

The high-profile initiative between the NCA, Crimestoppers and the Spanish authorities has seen 65 out of 76 wanted British suspects detained.

Last year alone, 54 fugitives were arrested in Spain and brought back to the UK, the NCA said.

Commenting on the police's failure to apprehend suspected British drug trafficker Jayson McDonald, the inspector said she was 'disappointed' but added: 'He is not going to be back in the UK so we'll arrest him here.'

Anyone with information on the whereabouts of the fugitives is asked to call Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111 or go online at www.crimestoppers-uk.org.

As part of Operation Captura, the National Crime Agency today published a list of ten of Britain's most wanted fugitives thought to have fled to Spain. They are: 

1. Shane Walford: 38, was wanted by West Midlands Police for manslaughter. The former soldier and boxer was jailed for 54 months in July 2010 after he killed firefighter Paul Gibbons at a bar in Coventry. He was recalled to prison in August 2013 after breaking the terms of his licence. He has now been arrested in the Canary Islands.

2. Mohammed Jahangir Alam: 32, is wanted by Gloucestershire Police for rape and sexual assault. He was convicted in March 2010 and sentenced to 14 years in his absence.

3. Carlo Dawson: 52, is wanted by the Met Police on suspicion of indecent assault and making indecent photographs of a child. Dawson, from south London, is believed to have indecently assaulted a 12-year-old girl between October 1996 and October 1997.
