A powerful earthquake has struck Japan's east coast - prompting officials to issue a tsunami warning for the region.

The 7.3 magnitude tremor hit at 2.10am on Saturday (5.10pm GMT today) near the crippled Fukushima nuclear site.

Despite striking 170 miles off the coast, it was reportedly felt in Tokyo - at least 300 miles away.

Japan's authorities have issued a 'small tsunami' alert - warning that waves up to one metre (3.3ft) could reach the coast following the quake in the Pacific Ocean.

Workers at the Fukushima power station, operated by Tokyo Electric Power Co (Tepco), have been told to leave the waterfront and move to higher ground, according to local reports.

However, there has been no reported damage to land or people along the coast.

Only two of Japan's 50 nuclear reactors have been online since the country was struck by a 9.0 magnitude earthquake, causing a devastating tsunami, in March 2011.

The quake - which claimed the lives of about 19,000 people - triggered multiple meltdowns and massive radiation leaks at the Fukushima site, which is situated about 160 miles north-east of Tokyo.

In the days and weeks following the tremor, reactors flung radioactive substances into the air, soil and sea as part of a clean-up operation.

Since then, the power station has been beset with power outages and other problems.

This had led outside experts to question whether Tepco is 
qualified to handle the cleanup, which is unprecedented due to the 
amount of radioactive material on the site and its coastal location.

Earlier this year, the company lost power to cool spent uranium fuel rods at the plant after a rat tripped an electrical wire.

And
just last month, Tepco employees found that 430 litres of highly 
radioactive water had leaked from one of the hastily built storage 
tanks.
