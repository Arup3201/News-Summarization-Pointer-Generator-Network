'Stupid behaviour': Anton Rodgers, the son of Liverpool football boss Brendan Rodgers admitted having a photograph taken exposing himself in front of a girl, his trial heard

The son of Liverpool football manager Brendan Rodgers today admitted having a photograph taken exposing himself in front of a girl, but claimed it was just ‘boy banter', a court heard.

Anton Rodgers, 19, denied he and three of his team mates sexually assaulted the teenage girl, saying she was awake and giggling throughout the horseplay.

He said he joined in the 'boy banter' because he wanted to fit in as he was a new member of the Brighton and Hove team, but he admitted that with hindsight that it was ‘stupid behaviour’.

Rodgers, a midfielder with the Championship club, is alleged to be one of four footballers who took snaps of the drunk blonde, whose drink may have been spiked, as they exposed themselves and made vulgar poses around her.

The girl only realised what had happened to her when she woke up semi-naked next to Rodgers in the Jury’s Inn hotel in Brighton the next morning, the court heard.

Jurors were told she borrowed Rodgers’ mobile phone and came across the pictures of a blonde woman in a pink dress ‘clearly not awake’ with men masturbating around her.

But today Rodgers, 19, denied anything sexual was going on.

He told the jury he and his team mates had gone out after celebrating their 2-0 pre-season victory over Eastbourne FC on July 16, 2011 and he saw the girl 'being flirtatious' with another player.

Rodgers, who had only signed with the club three to four weeks before on £250 a week, said he only spoke briefly to the girl who wanted to know why first team player Leon Redwood was not paying any attention to her.

At around 2am, he returned to the hotel with George Barker, 21, to go to bed, but was a woken half an hour later when his teams mates Steve Cook and Lewis Dunk, both 21, came into his room with the girl.

He said there was a 'jovial, laughing atmosphere' and the girl 'seemed content.'

He said: 'It was still a jokey atmosphere. I remember Steve being quite drunk but he was being quite funny. He was one of the main characters in the team.'

He said the girl who was wearing a tight dress then cuddled up between him and George who were in the double bed adding; 'She moved on to me and tried to kiss my neck but I ended up shrugging her off.

'She tried to grab my penis area and I said to her to get off. I had no interest in what she seemed to be intent on.

'It appeared she was doing the same to George, I can’t recall them snogging but I could hear the same thing.'

He said Lewis and Steve were giggling too and they started taking photos on his phone but he denied there was any sexual gratification to it.

He said: 'No no. This was never the case. It was just a laugh. I understand now how stupid it was now but honest, it was just a bit of boy banter. It was jokey. As I said it was just boy banter, a good laugh.

'She was just giggling. She seemed to be laughing with us.'

But he added the atmospheres changed when Leon walked into the room.

He said: 'It seemed she was laughing, being bubbly and then that’s when she shut her eyes and seemed to be trying to go to sleep. I was awkward but Leon broke the awkwardness by laughing as well. From what I remember he sprayed the shaving foam on her leg.'

He said a picture was taken of George grinning with his thumbs up after writing his initials in shaving foam on her thigh and then they all left and they went to sleep.

The next morning the girl 'politely' asked to borrow his phone to make a call and then ten minutes later woke him because she had discovered the images and said: 'I think she was embarrassed'

He agreed to delete the pictures but forwarded the one with George and the shaving phone via BlackBerry messaging.

Steve Cook, who now plays for Bournemouth, also denies sexual assault and voyeurism

He and his team mates thought nothing more of the incident until they were arrested as they got off the team coach after returning from Wrexham in January of last year adding 'This was a shock.'

Talking about when he exposed his penis he said: 'I was standing directly above her but that was it. I was not kneeling down or crouching. I was standing on the bed while she was laughing.

'It was a laugh, I was new at the time. It was funny at the time. Looking back at it, it was just the case of fitting in and having a laugh.'

It is alleged the ‘pretty, outgoing’ woman, now 21, had asked Rodgers to delete the photos but he just laughed.

She later confided in a work colleague what had happened, but was too scared to go to police.

It was not until another player told her months later that the pictures were being passed around the club and threatened to post them on the internet that she finally reported it.

Rodgers, Barker, Dunk and their former team-mate Cook, 21, who now plays for Bournemouth, all deny charges of sexual assault and voyeurism.

The Old Bailey heard they went to several bars and she ended up coming back to their hotel room.

But she claims the next thing she remembers is waking up in bed with Rodgers in just his underwear with her bra off and her dress pulled up.

When interviewed by police, Rodgers refused to answer questions and the other three gave very basic accounts of what had happened that night.

Barker said there was only one picture taken of him with the shaving foam, Dunk claimed he had fallen asleep while Cook admitted he may have been in the background but did not get his penis out.

The foam picture was discovered on Barker’s phone when he was arrested.

The trial continues.
