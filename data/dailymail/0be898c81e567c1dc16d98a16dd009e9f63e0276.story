A man suspected of faking his own drowning as part of a scheme to collect on his life insurance policy has been arrested at the hospital where he was receiving psychiatric treatment.

Raymond Roth, 47, is accused of wasting police manpower after his son reported that he had drifted out to sea and died while swimming near his home in Long Island, New York on July 28.

Officers combed the water near the beach during a massive rescue effort but, days later and 730 miles away from home, Roth was stopped by police for speeding in South Carolina.

Roth arrived at state park police headquarters in handcuffs on Wednesday wearing a blue polo shirt and white trousers.

He will be arraigned in a Long Island courtroom on charges of insurance fraud, conspiracy to commit insurance fraud and falsely reporting an incident. Roth will plead not guilty, attorney Brian Davis said.

Roth was arrested at South Nassau Communities Hospital in Oceanside, where he had spent about 10 days undergoing treatment.

He was reported missing by his son on July 28 at Jones Beach. The elder Roth was later reported to be in Florida and got a speeding ticket in South Carolina.

Charges: Roth is due to be arraigned on Wednesday afternoon on charges of insurance fraud, conspiracy to commit insurance fraud and falsely reporting an incident

'Scheme': Roth's son Jonathan, left, and his attorney Joey Jackson after his appearance in court on Tuesday on charges that he helped his father to fake his death. Jonathan claims he was coerced

His son, 22-year-old Jonathan, was arrested last week. According to court documents, the pair conspired to get more than $50,000 in life insurance money.

But Davis said his client was not aware of an insurance scam and blamed the man's son.

'My client's intent was to disappear, not to cash in on a life insurance policy,' Davis told The Associated Press.

He added that Jonathan Roth is the one who tried to cash in on the policy just days after reporting his father's disappearance. 'It was never my client's intent to make a claim,' he said.

Days after his disappearance, Raymond Roth was reported to be at a resort in Orlando, Florida and on August 2, he was stopped driving at 90 mph in Santee, South Carolina.

When police ran his name, they saw he was listed as missing, but Roth said he was driving back to New York and the officer let him continue.

Cost: Tens of thousands of dollars were wasted searching for Roth at Jones Beach, Long Island

Found: Roth left his shoes, wallet, clothing and phone on the beach when attempting to fake his death

Caught: More than a week after his disappearance, Roth was pulled over for speeding in South Carolina

But he failed to show up to a scheduled meeting with police and his attorney claimed he had in fact been admitted to hospital with depression.

Jonathan Roth, 22, is free on $10,000 bond. He has pleaded not guilty to conspiracy to commit insurance fraud, filing a false report and other charges.

Court papers show he 'was fully aware that his father never walked into the water and had in fact driven off in his own personal vehicle'.. He faces up to 15 years in prison if found guilty.

The younger Roth's attorney, Joey Jackson, said his client and his father had a 'strained' relationship and claims he was coerced into going along with the scheme - which Davis has denied.

He also claimed he feared for his life after his father left him a threatening voicemail when the scandal went public.

Hurt: Roth's wife Evana said she found emails between Roth and her stepson planning the disappearance

Up for sale: Roth had also put his Long Island home on the market days before he faked his death

'Listen, tough guy. You say you’ve been to the Marines and you can kill and everything else. When I get back, you are gonna do just that. One of us is going to die,' Mr Roth allegedly said.

Raymond Roth's wife, Evana, said her husband had not told her of the scheme, and handed over emails she found on the family computer that implicated her stepson.

In one dated the day before he vanished, the elder Roth told his son to contact him at an Orlando resort to update him on developments following his disappearance.

'This is a terrible nightmare that I just want to wake up from,’ said 43-year-old Evana last week. 'Why did he do this? I think I’m just numb.’

Raymond Roth had put the family's home up for sale just days before he vanished, and Evana Roth also said her husband had recently been fired from his job in New York City.

Police estimated that an air and sea search for Roth cost tens of thousands of dollars.
