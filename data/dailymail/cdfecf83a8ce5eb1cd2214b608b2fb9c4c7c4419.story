New York Racing Association officials say they've banned a food truck - which the organization previously lauded as 'one of the country’s top barbecue fusion trucks' - from Saratoga Race Course after customers complained that the name of the business was offensive.

The co-owners of the Schenectady-based Wandering Dago tell local media that they were informed Friday night by NYRA officials that they had to remove their truck from the track Saturday morning, a day after it opened for its 40-day season.

NYRA officials say they received complaints about the use of a word that's considered derogatory to Italian-Americans.

The truck's owners say they're both of Italian descent and consider the term a tribute to their hardworking immigrant ancestors.

One of the owners of the food truck business, Brandon Snooks, told the Albany Times Union that he was told he had to remove the truck from the track's grounds or it would be towed.

The business has a contract with the racetrack that lasts the duration of the track's 40-day season. Part of the contract stipulates that the track has to provide a 30-day written notice of cancellation. The owners say they were given no such notice, and that there were no concerns raised about the name in the six months they spent negotiating their contract with NYRA. 

'We had to turn down several weddings and a few festivals to make this 
commitment to the race track, not to mention the food product already 
purchased,' Snooks told the paper.

Centerplate, the company that supervises food service at the track, says it will not charge Wandering Dago for the food it purchased. But that doesn't begin to cover costs the company already has incurred, including equipment purchased for track season and lost revenue from track sales 
and from catering engagements Wandering Dago turned down because of its 
contract in Saratoga, its owners say.

A spokesman for the racetrack said it had received multiple complaints about the name, which led to the company getting the boot.

'We received several complaints' on Friday, said NYRA spokesman Eric Wing. 'This should have been handled before Friday, but once we received 
complaints, we took immediate action on behalf of our customers.'

Snooks says he - as an Italian American - doesn't consider the name offensive and cites the origin of the term as a sense of pride for Italian Americans.

The term 'dago' is derived from Italian immigrants who worked as laborers and asked to be paid 'as 
the day goes.' That evolved into 'dago,' the owners say. 

'That’s how we make 
our money, as they day goes. It might be 50 people, or it might be 100; 
there’s no guarantee. And since we wander to different cities during the
day, we thought the name was perfect,' the owners said.

Wandering dago had a previous run-in with the state when it was denied a food vendor's license at the Empire State Plaza in downtown Albany.

'It is ridiculous that we are a licensed New York state corporation, yet 
we are being blocked from doing business by state officials,' Snooks said.
