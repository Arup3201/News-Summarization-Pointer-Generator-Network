These breathtaking wedding pictures have captured the public’s imagination and gone viral.

The shots were taken by Anchorage-based photographer Josh Martinez, who travelled by helicopter to Alaska's Knik Glacier which is located 60 miles east of Anchorage, Alaska. The ice field is over 25 miles long and 5 miles wide, one of the largest in Southcentral Alaska.

Each image is part of a series of wedding pictures which were taken of an adventurous bride and groom on a day that they’re not likely to forget.

Across the threshold: The groom, wearing a grey suit scoops his beautiful bride into his arms as they bravely stand in water for their wedding shoot in Alaska

Something blue: This gorgeous image is just one of many that completely 'trashed' the bride's wedding dress according to the photographer

During the photo shoot, the couple gave Martinez full creative control and even waded knee-deep into a glacial pool of stunningly water ruining the bride's wedding gown in the process.

They posed near snowy mountains and icy pools of water that are so brilliantly blue that they look surreal.

Martinez, works for Chugach Peaks Photography.

He told Petapixel: ‘The Bride & Groom gave me full creative freedom and in this case, that meant wading knee-deep into an icy glacial pool for Alaska’s ultimate trash-the-dress session!’

‘To access
 this incredible location, we explored the surface of the glacier by 
helicopter and located several pools of Windex-blue water that fit my 
vision perfectly.

‘Our
 pilot landed on the glacier, and after fitting some safety gear we 
headed out to explore this epic world of ice, silt and water.’

‘The photo opportunities were endless, and I cannot wait to head back to the glacier for another shoot,’ he said.

Martinez describes himself as a ‘pilot, traveling photographer and adventure junkie.’
