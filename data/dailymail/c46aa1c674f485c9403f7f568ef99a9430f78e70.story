Barcelona forward Neymar Jnr has been gearing up for this weekend's crucial Clasico in the only logical way - freestyling in the gym wearing his underpants and not much else.

The Brazil international showed off an impressive repertoire of tricks and flicks as he was filmed in a short video that was later uploaded to his official Instagram page.  

The former Santos player, donning socks, gloves and a hat in addition to the aforementioned under garments, pulled out all the stops ahead of Sunday's showdown against Real Madrid.

On this evidence, not to mention the 26 goals the 23-year-old has scored this season, the Real defence should have their work cut out trying to shackle Neymar at the Nou Camp.

Barcelona could move four points clear of Carlo Ancelotti's side at the top of La LIga should they win what could prove a title-defining match.

The two giants approach the match in contrasting form with Barcelona having won 17 of their last 18 matches in all compeitions - the latest a 1-0 victory against Premier League champions Manchester City on Wednesday night.

Real, meanwhile, have only won once in their last four games and have struggled for form since the turn of the year, but Lionel Messi admits his side cannot afford to become complacent.

'We are playing well but we cannot get carried away because there is a long way to go,' Messi said.

'We have some big games... first against Madrid and then there are the quarter-finals (of the Champions League) where we will face another tough team.

'I have a lot of respect for Madrid. When Madrid are in this situation it is when they are most dangerous,' he added.

'They have great players. We will go out to play our football and look to win but at the same time we need to be wary of them as much as ever.'
