Step aside Ernie – there's a new man in town.

Grandfather Derek Arch might not be known for his speed - but he's proved he's the oldest milkman in the west, by still delivering at age 85.

Mr Arch, from Coventry, West Midlands, started the job in 1943 as a favour for his father, who ran the family milk business.

Going strong: Derek Arch, 85, still delivers milk to 300 houses on his 1950s cart, which goes at a top speed of 15mph

Best in the west: Mr Arch gets up at 2.30am seven days a week to deliver the milk to his customers. He has worked for the family business, which was set up by his own grandfather, since 1943

But 71 years on, Mr Arch is still going strong - and now delivers to more than 300 homes.

He said: ‘When I was young I would take out two churns of milk, which I carried on my pushbike. I would stop at the customer’s houses, and walk straight in. No-one locked their doors in those days.

‘I would then ladle the milk into their jug and be on my way. Everything was much simpler back then- it was a different time.’

But not everything has changed for Mr Arch in the past seven decades.

While Ernie The Fastest Milkman in the West - a fictional character created by comedian Benny Hill - delivered his goods in a horse-drawn cart, Mr Arch still proudly delivers in his 1950s milk float.

The archaic vehicle, which he has owned for 30 years, can do a top speed of 15mph – if it’s going downhill.

Milk in the veins: Derek Arch, left, aged 18 - four years after his first milk round, which he did as a favour for his ill father. The 85-year-old is now helped by his own son, Stuart, 54, who plans to take over the business

The milk industry has been in the Arch family for four generations.

Mr Arch’s grandfather founded the business, D Arch and Sons, in 1873.

Derek planned to be a carpenter but was roped into doing his first milkround at age 14 when his father was ill.

He said: ‘It should have been a short term stand-in but I’ve ended up doing it ever since. I wouldn’t have been a very good carpenter anyway.’

Decades on, the business is still a 
family affair. Mr Arch works with his son Stuart, 54, who will follow in
 his father's footsteps and take over the business.

And his wife Betty, 83, to whom Mr Arch has been married for 63 years, used to organise the business accounts.

But even though Betty no longer works, Mr Arch has no plans to retire.

He said: ‘I’ve done if for this long so I may as well carry on. Anyway, Betty likes it because it keeps me out of the house!’

Mr Arch also has one grandson, who is 17, but says the teenager has no intention of carrying on the family business.

After years of experience, the proud milkman now has his routine down to a fine art.

After waking at 2.30am, Mr Arch usually leaves the house at 4.30am to make sure his customers get their milk in time for breakfast.

Not for the faint hearted: Mr Arch says he has no plans to retire even though his wife Betty, 83, is retired

He said: ‘Back in the day, I didn’t have to rush my guts out to finish- I could be done at one o’clock in the afternoon.

‘Usually women didn’t work so there was always someone at home to collect the milk.

‘But now I only have a short amount of time to do my deliveries before people go off to work in the morning.’

Luckily, Mr Arch is still kept busy, despite demand for milkmen falling.

He said: ‘Although there isn’t the same demand as there once was, people still want milk and I have grown to know my customers very well.

‘When you work at a job for as long as I have, your customers go up and down as they pop their clogs.

‘I used to do the milk for everyone in my cul-de-sac, now only two of them have the milk from me.

'Milkmen are dropping like flies. Our motto is: use us or lose us.'

Derek says the industry is very different, compared to when he first started out.

According to Mr Arch, the days of milk in bottles, which used to cost around two old pennies, are over.

He said: ‘What people don’t tell you is glass bottle are the most environmentally friendly as you can wash and reuse them time and time again.

‘Think how much plastic is wasted with milk cartons now. It’s terrible.’

After working for more than seven decades, Mr Arch still has the same work ethic as he has always done.

He said: ‘The only difference now is I feel the cold. When I was a youngster I could go out delivering the milk without so much of a coat on - we had 10-15 degree winters back then.

‘But now it can be bitter and I’m just an old man trying to do a good job. I have to wrap right up.’

Mr Arch Jnr, 54, said: ‘My great grandad started this business and I am glad to be a part of it.

‘I am proud of Dad for the way he works- I hope I’m still delivering pints when I’m his age.’
