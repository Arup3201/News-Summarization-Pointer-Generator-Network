Cleared: Christopher Hird (pictured yesterday outside court), 48, of East Yorkshire, was told the case would be dropped because all three allegations amounted to less than one minute of contact in total

A science teacher admitted he was 'stabbed in the back' by three of his female pupils who  maliciously accused him of sexual assault after he leaned over them during chemistry lessons.

Christopher Hird, 48, who was a teacher for 24 years, was yesterday cleared of touching three girls aged 11 to 16 for his sexual gratification.

Mr Hird - who was also head of science at South Holderness Technology College in Hull, East Yorkshire - was repeatedly told the case would be dropped because all three allegations amounted to less than one minute of contact.

But instead he was hauled through the courts, suspended from his £38,000-a-year job, and forced to wait 15 months to prove his innocence.

After a six-day trial which cost nearly £100,000, a jury agreed with Mr Hird's case that his contact with the girls was accidental and innocent.

One pupil had even gone to the headteacher of the school to stop the case because he thought it was malicious - but the boy was not listened to.

Mr Hird spoke outside Hull Crown Court yesterday after being found not guilty of two charges of sexual assault, one of sexual activity with a child and another of indecent assault.

He said: ‘I have been through 15 months of hell for no good reason. It should never have come to court. I knew I was innocent. My lawyers kept saying it would be dropped, but no-one wanted to make that common sense decision.

‘My thoughts were only for the children’s welfare. When I moved around the classroom to lean over children it was only in the proper context. My motives were pure.

‘You don’t expect a knife in the back from a child, but innocent teachers run a daily risk of having their lives destroyed by false claims from children. I am afraid the teaching profession is under siege from similar complaints.’

And Magistrate Tony Smith, a former teacher 
whose daughter was taught by Mr Hird, said: ‘I had no doubt about his 
innocence, but he has paid a high price.

'The one thing that has struck 
me about this case is the girls have remained anonymous, but his 
personal life has been pilloried.’

The case was sparked by a girl who told a friend she would ‘get him done’ for touching her hair while using a paper towel to remove ink sprayed on her face by a disruptive pupil in a lesson.

She was unhappy that he had moved hair out of the way and told her mother, saying he had put his hand near her crotch and brushed her thigh. Mr Hird denied any touching had taken place at all. He said the girl had not liked it when he told her to take her coat off in a lesson and she had refused.

He said it had been a battle not worth 
fighting because she was part of a troubling group who were working. A 
male classmate of the girl told the jury he saw her outside immediately 
after the incident.

The boy said she was grinning and initially claimed it had been an accident. But when challenged about reporting the touching, the pupil claimed she told him: ‘I don’t care. I don’t like him’

He said he was so concerned he went to the headteacher, but could not stop the case progressing.

The boy added that Mr Hird had already been suspended, but over the coming weeks he found the girl’s account was changing as she told it to other people.

He said: ‘He was a good teacher one of the best I had for science. I never saw him behave in a sexually inappropriate way. She was exaggerating. I heard her tell three or four different accounts to people. I thought there was something odd about this. She did not seem distraught in any way.’

Mr Hird told the jury: ‘I am an enthusiastic and dedicated teacher who has a child’s best possible interests at heart. I always aimed to get them to fulfil their potential. I did get results.’

The jury heard there were two other complaints from girls of touching as he leant across them. One girl claimed he pull a paper towel out from under her bottom and touched her buttock.

Mr Hird said the girls had made up the allegations. He told police one girl was probably just after compensation because she only came
forward after reading about his arrest in the local newspaper.

On the main complaint where he was said to
have brushed her hair sexually, he said: ‘She asked me where the ink 
was. It could easily have gone in her eye.

Legal process: After a six-day trial at Hull Crown Court (pictured), which cost neatly £100,000, a jury took less than three hours to agree with Mr Hird's case that his contact with the girls was accidental and innocent

‘The contact with the paper towel was a few seconds. It was not sexually motivated. I got no pleasure from it. I was far from happy at the time. I wanted her to get back to work.’

Christopher Hird will now have his suspension reviewed, the local council confirmed today.

Director of children, family and 
adult services at East Riding Council, Alison Michalska, said: ‘The 
overriding concern of the council is the health and welfare of East 
Riding pupils.

‘As soon as the council is advised of
an accusation against a member of staff or anyone working with 
children, immediate action is taken to safeguard the young people 
concerned and the police are informed.

‘I would urge anyone who has any 
concerns about someone to speak up and all calls made to the East Riding
Safeguarding Children's Board are always treated in the strictest of 
confidence. East Riding Council will be reviewing Mr Hird's suspension following the conclusion of the court proceedings.’

He told the court there were 23 students in most of his classes and he treated boys the same as girls, adding: ‘It is best practice to circulate as much as possible when teaching.

‘I accept it means coming into close 
proximity with students. It is impossible to read their work if you 
don’t get to their eye line. I place myself in a position where I could 
see their work.’

Eleven members of staff and nine former pupils gave glowing character references to the jury.

A 19-year-old Hull University chemistry student, said: ‘He is a very good teacher and easy to get along with. He gave up his lunch times to help with revision only two other teachers did that.’

Defence barrister Mark McKone told the jury Mr Hird had worked his way up through the school to his job without criticism. He said schools were the worst place for Chinese whispers - which could produce the most sinister meanings.

Mr McKone added that Mr Hird’s character references showed he did not have a bad reputation and the allegations were not credible.

Mr Hird himself said after the case that he was waiting to discover whether he will be re-instated in his job and wanted the case out of the way to return in September.

He added that despite adverse headlines in the local newspaper, he had not suffered in the street from taunts and found a huge amount of support from people.
