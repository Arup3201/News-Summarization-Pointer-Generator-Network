The Barefoot Bandit smiled in court as he was sentenced to seven years in jail today after pleading guilty to an amazing two-year crime spree of burglary and theft across nine states in the U.S.

Colton Harris-Moore, 20, of Camano Island, Washington, who gained notoriety for his crimes and a 20th Century Fox film deal to help repay his victims, looked down and smiled as the court case came to end.

He was captured by authorities in the Bahamas in a hail of bullets in July 2010 after crash-landing a stolen aircraft he had flown from Indiana.

Friday's proceedings consolidated cases 
against Harris-Moore in three Washington counties. He has already 
pleaded guilty to federal charges in Seattle and will be sentenced for 
those crimes early next year. He will serve his state and federal 
sentences at the same time.

The high school dropout and self-taught pilot stayed a step ahead of the law as he broke into dozens of homes and stole cars, boats and planes.

Harris-Moore, who will receive his first of two sentences on Friday, got his nickname for apparently committing crimes without shoes.

Shoeless footprints, some outlined in chalk, were left behind at the scenes of a number of his crimes - such as in Orcas Island (see photos).

Prosecutors will ask for a nine-and-a-half year sentence, while his lawyers John Browne and Emma Scanlan are seeking a six-year term.

‘He was a menace,’ Greg Banks, prosecuting, said. ‘His burglaries threatened and distressed people.’

The money from his $1.3million film deal will be used to help pay money he owes in compensation to the victims of his long crime spree.

Dustin Lance Black, who won an Academy Award for ‘Milk’, is working on the screenplay and has met with Harris-Moore in prison.

Harris-Moore's first conviction came at age 12, in 2004, for possession of stolen property.

Then he broke into the homes of his classmates to steal food because his mother spent most of her Social Security income on beer and cigarettes.

She has denied this. But over the next three years he was convicted of theft, burglary, malicious mischief and assault, among other crimes.

In 2007, the boy was jailed for three years for burglary, but fled a minimum security juvenile facility in April 2008 and was soon up to more tricks.

He hopscotched his way across the U.S., frequently crash-landing planes in rural areas and stealing vehicles from car parks at small airports.

Harris-Moore was eventually captured in the Bahamas last year but his escapades earned him cult status as an authority-mocking folk hero.

The crimes began in late 2009. He allegedly flew a stolen plane from Anacortes, Washington, to the San Juan Islands nearby.

He allegedly stole a pistol in British Columbia and took a plane from an Idaho hangar, where bare footprints were found on the floor and wall.

That plane crashed near Granite Falls, Washington, after it ran out of fuel, prosecutors said.

He made his way to Oregon in a 32ft boat stolen from Washington - stopping first to leave $100 at an animal shelter in Raymond, Washington.

From Oregon he travelled across the U.S. to the Bahamas, authorities said. In all, he was suspected of more than 100 crimes in nine states.

Several victims and a few curious citizens watched in Island County Superior Court on Friday, along with the defendant’s aunt.

The 33 counts include identity theft, theft of firearm and residential burglary. Friday's proceedings were before Judge Vickie Churchill.

He has already pleaded guilty to federal charges in Seattle and will be sentenced for those crimes early next year.

Harris-Moore still faces up to six-and-a-half years in prison when he is sentenced then. But he will serve both sentences at the same time.

His lawyers have cited his bleak childhood in a Camano Island trailer with an alcoholic mother and a series of her convict boyfriends.
