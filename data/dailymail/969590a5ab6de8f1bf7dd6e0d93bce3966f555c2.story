Findings: Teacher Ann Maguire died from 'shock and haemorrhage' after she was stabbed in the neck in her classroom, an inquest heard today

Teacher Ann Maguire died from 'shock and haemorrhage' after a major vein in her neck was severed when she was stabbed in the neck in her classroom, an inquest heard today.

The popular 61-year-old was attacked in front of her pupils as she taught a Spanish class at Corpus Christi Catholic College in Leeds, West Yorkshire last month.

Today, at the opening of the inquest into her death, detective chief 
inspector Nick Wallen, of West Yorkshire Police, said the teacher 
suffered a number of stab wounds but one to her neck, that severed her 
major jugular vein, was the fatal injury.

Mr Wallen gave the only evidence at the seven-minute-long hearing at Leeds Coroners Court today.

He told coroner David Hinchliff that the emergency services were called to Corpus Christi at 11.49am on the morning of April 28.

'They
 were directed to the top floor modern languages department where 
paramedics initially attended to Mrs Ann Maguire - a teacher at the 
school - who was very seriously injured having been stabbed,' the 
officer said.

'Mrs Maguire was taken by ambulance to Leeds General Infirmary for emergency treatment.

'Sadly, she did not survive her injuries and her death was pronounced at 1.10pm.'

He told the 
court that Home Office pathologist Brian Roger conducted a forensic 
post-mortem examination on the same day at Pinderfields Hospital, in 
Wakefield.

'Dr Rogers established Mrs Maguire's cause of death as shock and haemorrhage,' Mr Wallen told the coroner.

'Although there were a number of stab wounds, a stab wound to her neck had severed her jugular vein and was the fatal injury.'

He said a second post-mortem examination came to the same conclusion.

Mr Hinchliff heard Mrs Maguire's body was identified by her husband, Don, 32.

He issued a burial order and released the teacher's body so a funeral can now take place.

The coroner also asked a police family liaison officer present in court to pass his condolences on to Mrs Maguire's family.

Mr Hinchliff adjourned the inquest to a date to be fixed.

Mr Maguire and his daughters Emma, 30, a dancer with the Royal Ballet, and osteopath Kerry, 32, did not attend today's hearing.

Mrs
 Maguire, described by many of her students as 'inspirational', was 
killed on April 28, her day off, after going to school to help pupils 
prepare for their exams.She was just months from retiring after 40 years at Corpus Christi.

Her
 death was met with a huge outpouring of grief from pupils past and 
present, who flocked to the school to add their own tributes to a wall 
of flowers stretching 100 yards across the Corpus Christi gates to the 
church next door.

Mrs Maguire lived in the Moortown area of Leeds with her husband, who is a landscape gardener and former teacher.

As well as her two grown-up daughters she had two
 nephews, Andrew and Daniel, who she brought up as her own sons after the death of her 
sister Eileen Poole nearly 30 years ago.

Messages
 of condolence were also sent in from around the globe, including from 
Pope Francis.

Corpus Christ headteacher Steve Mort said the school 
had been 'overwhelmed by the amazing outpouring of love and affection 
for Ann'.

Mr Mort also described her as the 'mother of the school'.

Many
 of Mrs Maguire's pupils, who are now starting their GCSE exams, have 
vowed to get top grades in honour of their teacher, sharing the hashtag 
#AForAnn as part of their pledge.

Pupils also held a memorial football match and balloon release in her honour.

A 15-year-old boy appeared in court earlier this month charged with Mrs Maguire's murder and was remanded in custody.

He is due to go on trial in November.

The killing is thought to be the first time a teacher has been stabbed to death in a British classroom and the first murder of a teacher in a school since the 1996 Dunblane massacre.Â
