Real Madrid manager Carlo Ancelotti has advised Liverpool fans not to boo Cristiano Ronaldo at Anfield on Wednesday night because it will make him play even better.

Ronaldo spent six fruitful years at Liverpool's rivals Manchester United from 2003 to 2009, and could be in for a hostile reception in the Champions League clash.

But the Real boss, despite admitting Ronaldo is always motivated, said the barracking atmosphere gees him up even more.

CHAMPIONS LEAGUE TOP SCORERS

1. Raul - 71 (142 games)

2. Cristiano Ronaldo - 69 (105)

3. Lionel Messi - 68 (88)

4. Ruud van Nistelrooy - 56 (73)

5. Thierry Henry - 50 (112)

He told The Sun: 'He won't be more motivated because it's Liverpool.

'Cristiano is always super-motivated. But if the atmosphere is hostile it motivates him more.'

Ronaldo has never scored at Anfield in his five appearances there, but only lost one of those, an FA Cup tie in 2006.

But the Portuguese superstar is on fire again this term, scoring 20 goals in all competitions for club and country.

Ancelotti admits the game will be tough, claiming the club has always 'made him emotional', particularly when the club's anthem is blared out.

He added: 'I followed Liverpool from 1984 when I faced them with Roma in the European Cup final and we lost on penalties,' he said. 'It's always been a club that make me emotional.

'You'll Never Walk Alone is incredible. No one sings it the way Liverpool fans do.'

Liverpool have three points from their opening two Champions League games this season. Real have won both.
