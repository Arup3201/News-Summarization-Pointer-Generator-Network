You might call it the vengeful act of a bitter old woman, and for two centuries it has stood: an 18th-century spinster's demand for narrow pavements to prevent the irksome parading of young lovers arm in arm.

The rule was put in place on the orders of Lady Jane Stanley, who in the late 18th century offered to pay £400 for new paved public footpaths throughout the Cheshire town of Knutsford. There was just one condition: they should be made so narrow that pedestrians had to walk in single file.

But now, 220 years later, those narrow pavements will soon be no more as council chiefs put plans in place to pedestrianise the town's roads - effectively scrapping its narrow walkways..

It comes after a £15,000 study in to the effects of modernising pavements in the town after the narrow paths were ordered by the eccentric spinster who disapproved on public affection. 

Lady Jane became the inspiration for the main character in Elizabeth Gaskell's novel My Lady Ludlow and who was played by actress Francesa Annis in the adapted BBC drama, Cranford.

Councillor Michael Jones, Conservative leader of Cheshire East Council, said: 'I am all in favour of retaining our fantastic heritage, but this is one of those occasions when we can improve on the legacy of the past.

'We want to create a space which will be enjoyed by the residents - whether they are walking arm in arm or not - while also attracting visitors and enabling businesses in the locality to thrive. 

'The shops and businesses are a great asset to Cheshire East and the street merits and deserves enhancement works.'

Just what Lady Jane, who was the daughter of the 11th Earl of Derby, would have thought of the scheme is impossible to say. 

She lived in Brook House in Knutsford until her death in 1803 when she was reputed to be in her 80s and was a benefactor to the town after paying £400 to have the pavements laid.

In her book 'Knutsford: A history', author Joan Leach said: 'She did not approve of linking couples walking arm in arm, so stipulated that it should only be wide enough for one.'

A history of the town records say that at least one countryman, who got in her way while she was out walking, received a firm tap from Lady Jane's gold-headed cane, accompanied with the words: 'Take that fellow!'

But she often avoided confrontations on Knutsford's narrow pavements by taking to her sedan chair, which can still be seen in the town's heritage centre.

The book continued: 'She paraded with her gold-knobbed cane which she used to reprimand those who impeded her progress. Her sedan chair makes an annual appearance at the May Day Festival.'

In the book 'Mrs Gaskell: Haunts Homes and Stories' by Ellis Chadwick in 1910 it said: 'Lady Jane was beloved by her household, and admired by the whole neighbourhood; but she had very strict notions of propriety and of the courtesies of life, and would not have them infringed.'

It is also said that Lady Jane, of whom there is only believed to be one portrait, also suggested as her own epitaph: 'A maid I lived and a maid I died; I never was asked and never denied.'

Lady Jane Stanley was the daughter of the 11th Earl of Derby and was said to be an eccentric character, who remained single throughout her life.

She was carried through the town in a sedan chair because in those days there were no footpaths and she complained the hard stone cobbles caused her discomfort.

When she died she left a sum of money to provide a footpath, but because she disapproved of seeing young people walking arm-in-arm, she demanded that the footpath should be the width of a 'single flag'.

That way it would only be wide enough for one person to walk along and would not encourage the common form of courting, which she frowned upon.

As a result, the woman would occupy the pavement while the suitor had to either walk behind her or pick their way through the gutter. 

The sedan chair, used by Lady Jane Stanley, was built in 1769, left. It has since been used in the town's annual May Day celebrations, right is a young girl standing by the sedan chair in 1913

One of the road's in the town, Love Lane, was renamed Stanley Road after funds from Lady Jane's pot were used to plant trees along the side of the heath.

While this was going on, author-in-the-making, Elizabeth Gaskell was growing up in the town - and it later became the inspiration for her novel Cranford, published in 1851.

Gaskell went on to write My Lady Ludlow, who she revealed was inspired by Lady Jane Stanley, which recounts the daily lives of the widowed Countess of Ludlow of Hanbury and the spinster Miss Galindo, whose father was a Baronet.

The books were adapted by the BBC for a television series in 2007 and combines characters from both novels, starring Judi Dench and with Lady Jane played by actress Francesa Annis.

Lady Jane's sedan chair, built in 1769, can still be seen at the town's heritage centre and is showcased every year in the Knutsford 'Royal' May Day celebrations.

Some years ago it was urgently in need of restoration after parts of the frame had rotted, the fabric lining was in poor condition and the front window pane broken.

It was relined with cotton chintz, woven to match the original pattern, and a piece of the original lining is preserved in the heritage centre. 

Elizabeth Gaskell wrote Cranford in 1849 and the story focuses mainly on the fictional Cheshire town's single and widowed middle class female inhabitants.

Along with two other novellas My Lady Ludlow, and Mr Harrison's Confessions, it was developed into a BBC series Cranford in 2007 and also starred Dame Judy Dench as Matilda Jenkyns.

Mrs Gaskell once wrote in a letter: 'The character of my Lady Ludlow at once suggests the Honourable Mrs Jamieson in Cranford, and it is interesting to know that they were both founded on the same original 'Lady Jane Stanley' who lived at Brook House, Knutsford.

The street as it is now, is open to traffic and people are forced to walk along a tiny strip of paving stones

The plans for the road will mean that it will be completely pedestrianised and people can walk hand-in-hand

'Lady Jane was beloved by her household, and admired by the whole neighbourhood; but she had very strict notions of propriety and of the courtesies of life, and would not have them infringed.'

Cheshire East Council has drawn up a design concept to upgrade the street with wider pavements and higher quality materials.

It says the changes are intended to transform King Street into a 'more vibrant public space and improve access for people whose mobility is impaired, while retaining vehicular access at all times and as much on-street parking as possible.'

Andrew Malloy, chairman of the town centre working group in the Knutsford Town Plan said: 'After several years of hard work, and unparalleled engagement by the town plan, this is a real opportunity for Knutsford to get the high street it deserves - now is the time to get it right for everyone.' 

Knutsford might be best known for its service station but it has a history dating back until 1086

It is perhaps best known for its motorway service station, but Knutsford has history that dates back as far as the beginning of the last millennium.

Situated 14 miles from Manchester, the town was recorded in William the Conqueror's Domesday Book of 1086 as Cunetesford, after former King of England - King Canute.

He is said to have forded the River Lily, which runs through the town and is believed to be the smallest river in Europe.

The town celebrates an annual May Day celebration, which observes the custom of 'sanding the streets'. This is where the pavements are decorated with coloured sand and pictures.

It is said to derive from tradition by King Canute, that while he was fording the river he threw sand from his shoes into the path of a wedding party - wishing the newlyweds as many children as the grains of sand at their feet.  

The town is said to be a reasonably residential affluent area in 'Cheshire's Golden Triangle',which include Hale Barns and Alderley Edge, with house prices ranging from £79,000 to £3,850,000.

In 2005 Knutsford was named as the most expensive town to buy a house in Northern England, followed by nearby town Altrincham.

And it's home to celebrities including comedian Craig Cash, actress Barbara Knox and singer Gary Barlow.

It is also where the Tatton parliamentary constituency originated from, after it was named after Tatton Park, owned by the Egerton family.
