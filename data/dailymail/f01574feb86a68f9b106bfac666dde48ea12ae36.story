Convicted double murderer Joseph Wood was sentenced to death by lethal injection

The last words of convicted double murderer Joseph Wood were to prove pitifully ironic. As doctors inserted IV tubes into his arms in the death chamber at Arizona State Prison in Florence on Wednesday, Wood thanked Jesus as his Saviour — in his own mind at least — and made his peace with the world.

Strapped to a wheeled stretcher in an orange prison jumpsuit, he turned his head and grinned at the 20 or so witnesses watching him through a glass window from a small viewing room.

They included his lawyers, the family of his victims and the prison chaplain, fingering his rosary as he mouthed silent prayers.

‘I take comfort knowing today my pain stops, and I said a prayer that, on this or any other day, you may find peace in all of your hearts, and may God forgive you all,’ said 55-year-old Wood, signally omitting to apologise for his crimes.

‘Are those your last words?’, asked the prison warden. ‘Yes, sir,’ he replied.

As a controversial cocktail of lethal drugs coursed into his veins, Wood closed his eyes and appeared sedated. But whether his pain really had stopped as he expected, or whether he suffered prolonged agony was the subject of a fierce row yesterday.

Witnesses said Wood lay snorting and gasping for breath like a landed fish, and experts predicted his last moments may prove a watershed for the American way of execution.

For Wood — convicted in 1989 of murdering his estranged girlfriend Debra Dietz and her father Eugene in a shooting — took nearly two hours to die from a procedure that was supposed to kill him in ten to 15 minutes.

As Arizona’s governor, Jan Brewer, ordered an independent investigation into why his execution took so long, Department of Correction officials claimed that, although he may have taken a long time to die, there were no signs Wood suffered as he was ‘deeply sedated’ throughout.

They insisted the execution had followed protocol, with a doctor checking Wood was deeply under seven times before he was pronounced dead. He didn’t grimace or move throughout, said officials.

But independent witnesses begged to differ.

Michael Kiefer, a reporter for the Arizona Republic and an official media representative in the viewing room, had witnessed four previous executions. ‘Usually it takes about ten minutes, the person goes to sleep. This was not that,’ he said afterwards.

Mr Kiefer said it started normally as Wood, who appeared to be smiling slightly, took a few gulps of air and then closed his eyes. Four minutes into the process, a doctor appeared and checked Wood’s pulse and then spoke to witnesses through a microphone to confirm he was sedated.

But nine minutes after Wood’s final words, witnesses say it was clear something was wrong. His mouth opened and, three minutes later, it opened again and his chest moved as if he had started to burp. 

Then, he kept doing it — Mr Kiefer said he counted this chest movement at least 640 times. He and Fox 10 News reporter Troy Hayden exchanged glances and agreed they didn’t think he was ever going to die.

Both compared Wood’s breathing to a ‘fish on land gulping for air’. Mr Hayden described the procedure as ‘very disturbing to watch’ also saying that ‘It was tough for everybody in that room’.

Mr Kiefer said Wood appeared to be ‘drowning in air’. 

He added: ‘The movement was like a piston: the mouth opened, the chest rose, the stomach convulsed. And when the doctor came in to check on his consciousness and turned on the microphone to announce that Wood was still sedated, we could hear the sound he was making: a snoring, sucking — similar to when a swimming-pool filter starts taking in air.’

Witnesses said Joseph Wood lay gasping and snorting in his final moments (file picture of a lethal injection chamber) 

During the procedure, two of Wood’s lawyers left the viewing room and phoned judges — including one in the U.S. Supreme Court — to try to get the execution stopped on the grounds that it breached the U.S. Constitution’s ban on ‘cruel and unusual punishment’. They failed.

At last, say witnesses, Wood’s gasping became less frequent, and finally stopped as a doctor re-examined him and stated he was still sedated. 

At 3.49pm local time, an hour and 57 minutes after the procedure started, Charles Ryan, director of Arizona’s Corrections Department, appeared in the window next to Wood’s stretcher and announced that the execution had been completed.

Wood’s lawyer, Dale Baich, said his client had ‘gasped and struggled to breathe for about an hour and 40 minutes’. 

His next statement was damning: ‘The experiment failed. Arizona appears to have joined several other states who have been responsible for an entirely preventable horror — a bungled execution.’

Death penalty opponents said the worst thing about the prolonged death was that it was ‘entirely predictable and avoidable’.

The family of Wood’s victims, who had watched the execution, argued any agony he had gone through had been nothing to what he had inflicted on their relatives.

‘I don’t believe he was suffering. It sounded to me like he was snoring,’ said Jeanne Brown.

‘You don’t know what excruciating is. What’s excruciating is seeing your dad laying there in a pool of blood, seeing your sister laying there in a pool of blood.

‘This man deserved it.’

As her comments made all too clear, the case is unlikely to shake many Americans in their backing of the death penalty. Supporters tend to argue no agony in the condemned’s final moments can ever outweigh his or her awful crime.

But Wood’s protracted death is expected to have profound implications in the debate about how capital punishment is carried out.

Since Texas first used lethal injection for execution in 1982, states have adopted it as a supposedly painless solution.

However, the practice has been mired in controversy as supplies of the usual killer barbiturates have run out and executioners — often under-trained jail staff — have been forced to inject alternative drugs.

Those used in the Wood execution — a mix of a sedative called midazolam, that is supposed to bring on unconsciousness, and narcotic painkiller hydromorphone, that is designed to shut down breathing and stop the heart — have proved problematic before.

Controversy has focused on midazolam in two recent executions. In January, in Ohio the same two drugs took more than 20 minutes to kill Dennis McGuire, as he reportedly gasped, then started making snorting and choking sounds as he clenched his fists.

Midazolam was used again in April by Oklahoma prison chiefs putting to death killer Clayton Lockett. Until blinds were lowered to block their view, witnesses said he writhed violently, at one point saying: ‘Man’, before dying after 43 minutes from a heart attack.

It is now believed the catheter was placed incorrectly, allowing the lethal drugs to seep into Lockett’s tissue rather than into his veins. This would have meant he was only part-sedated when a final, painful heart-stopping drug was injected.

America’s National Institutes of Health has warned side effects of midazolam can include seizures, uncontrollable shaking and breathing problems. 

And David Waisel, associate professor in anaesthesia at Harvard Medical School, compares the suffering Wood would have endured to the feeling of being punched in the stomach and gasping for air — in his case, for nearly two hours.

He blamed a combination of rigid execution rules — that prevent staff responding if the procedure is going wrong — with the fact most of the executioners administering the drugs are unskilled, particularly in the difficult field of anaethesia.

‘With an unsafe system, bad things happen,’ he said yesterday.

While doctors check the state of the inmate and attach IV lines, the actual process of administering the lethal dose is left to prison staff.

The executioners’ biggest problem now is that many of the most effective drugs — including propofol, the sedative that contributed to Michael Jackson’s death, and another, sodium thiopental — are now only made in Europe.

And the European Union, which has banned the death penalty, has told drug companies they cannot export the chemicals to the U.S. if they know they are to be used for lethal injections.

In 2010, campaign group Reprieve UK, which opposes capital punishment, discovered two UK companies — Archimedes Pharma UK and Dream Pharma (based in offices above a driving school in west London) — had unwittingly supplied Arizona with execution drugs and business secretary Vince Cable imposed an export ban.

The drugs shortage has led some states to suspend executions and others to find back-door methods of getting the chemicals or to find new drugs companies.

Facing claims that they are using substandard, impure drugs, prison officials have refused to reveal their new suppliers.

Some states, meanwhile, are looking at older execution methods. Tennessee politicians support a return to the electric chair, while a Wyoming senator has demanded firing squads. However, experts predict that neither method is likely to meet the ban on ‘cruel and unusual’ punishment.

Campaign group Human Rights Watch has compiled a list of U.S. executions between 1982 and 2006, which it says were ‘botched’. None took as long as that of Wood.

Meanwhile, a major poll last year by the Pew Research Center found 55 per cent of American adults favour the death penalty for murder, while 37 per cent oppose it. This is a substantial fall on two years previously when 62 per cent said they supported it.

With America at last wavering over capital punishment, could the lingering death of Joseph Wood be the final nail in its coffin?
