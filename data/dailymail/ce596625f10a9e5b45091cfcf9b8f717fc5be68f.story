The last time the England team had an aura about them was at the World Cup in 2006. They were a bloody difficult team to beat.

When that team stood in the tunnel, the opposition knew that they would be in for a game.

There was a presence about Gary Neville, Rio Ferdinand, John Terry, Ashley Cole, Steven Gerrard, Frank Lampard, Wayne Rooney and captain David Beckham when they took to the field.

Final farewell: England's players were given a rousing reception by fans in the Estadio Mineirao

At the 2006 World Cup, the starting line up had 25 top level league titles between them and hundreds of Champions League appearances - Neville (6), Ferdinand (1), Terry (2), Cole (2), Beckham (6), Lampard (2) and Owen Hargreaves (4 Bundesliga titles).

Michael Owen had never won a league title at the time, but he had been named European footballer of the year in 2001.

That squad had unquestionable pedigree and a wealth of experience playing football at the very highest level. How England’s head coach Roy Hodgson could do with some of that.

Take his full strength team for the 2-1 defeat against Uruguay and there are only 10 Premier League titles between them: Joe Hart (2), Glen Johnson (1), Wayne Rooney (5), Danny Welbeck (1) and Daniel Sturridge (1).

It is evidence of some success, but Johnson, Welbeck and Sturridge were not influential members of their respective teams when they won the league. 

Sven-Goran Eriksson’s squad was different, with powerful names playing significant roles at Manchester United, Chelsea and Bayern Munich. They were serial winners with their club sides, putting domestic rivalries to one side when they pulled on the England shirt under Eriksson. They didn’t like losing.

Solid: Ashley Cole, pictured here in action against Ecuador at the 2006 World Cup, was a key part of Sven-Goran Eriksson's defence

Unfortunate: Eriksson (right) and David Beckham (left) fell at the quarter-final stage in Germany eight years ago

Experienced: John Terry and Rio Ferdinand, pictured against Trinidad and Tobago at the 2006 World Cup, gave England a solid foundation

Eventually they were beaten by Portugal in the quarter-final in Gelsenkirchen, knocked out of the tournament on penalties after playing for an hour with ten men. They were a stubborn bunch.

England had already qualified from the group after opening victories against Paraguay and Trinidad & Tobago. They drew with Sweden and slipped past Ecuador before they went on to play Portugal.

England could be beaten, like any other team could be beaten, but you would have to work hard for it. Eriksson’s team played tournament football, keeping their opponents in the group games in Germany at arm’s length as they made their way through to the last eight.

It wasn’t particularly attractive or pretty to watch, but England were resilient and stubborn. They are pre-requisites at this level. What Hodgson would give for that after this dismal, depressing World Cup in Brazil.

The top teams play on the fear factor, growing in stature and intimidating their opponents with this air of invincibility.

Turning point: Wayne Rooney's red card against Portugal in 2006 contributed towards England's exit on penalties in Gelsenkirchen

Spain fed off it for six years, twice winning the European championships and the World Cup while everyone attempted to catch up. They won a psychological war, too, convincing people that they had redefined the game and invented a new way of playing football with the principles of tiki-taka. Their opponents believed they hype.

Spain created an aura and people got carried away with the idea that they had reinvented the wheel.What they really had was a highly-talented group of players who flourished under the stewardship of Luis Aragones and then Vicente del Bosque. When they were together, they ticked.

When Hodgson reflects on a World Cup that he admitted he ‘under-estimated’ before Tuesday’s final group game with Costa Rica, he must revert to a more pragmatic approach.

England will sail through a qualification campaign that includes Estonia, Switzerland, Lithuania, San Marino and Slovenia to qualify for Euro 2016.

It's over the next two years, in the slog around Europe, that Hodgson must carefully prepare for his third tournament in charge of the national team.

Since some encouraging friendly results under Hodgson, with victories over Italy and Brazil (at Wembley), England’s results have been on the slide over the past year.

The World Cup warning signs were there when they were beaten easily by Germany and Chile at Wembley in the build-up to the tournament.

Draws with Ecuador and Honduras in Miami felt insignificant at the time, but few believed that this squad could make an impact at an international tournament.

When you look at England’s defence, their most vulnerable area going into the tournament, they have little experience of playing Champions League football.

Everton duo Leighton Baines and Phil Jagielka, who started both of England’s group games, have never played in the competition.

Room for improvement: England goalkeeper Joe Hart has played in the Champions League knockout stages just once before

Good enough? Glen Johnson (right) has just 18 appearances in Europe's elite club competition to his name

With the exception of Gary Cahill, who won the Champions League with Chelsea in 2012, the rest of England’s defence has never gone deep into the competition.

Glen Johnson made 15 appearances for Chelsea and three for Liverpool; Joe Hart has made 19 for Manchester City and Cahill also has the same number of appearances.

To bring this team together in two years’ time and bind them together into a formidable attacking unit will take something special.

The first step is to make England difficult to beat again at the very highest level. Once that has been established, Hodgson can start thinking about adding the finishing touches.
