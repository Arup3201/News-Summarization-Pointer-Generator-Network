The public breakdown of one of the directors of the Kony 2012 video prompted a response from the Prime Minister of Uganda, saying that the warlord at the heart of the video is not in his country.

Adopting the social media strategies that helped the charity, Invisible Children, create an internet sensation with their Kony 2012 video, Ugandan prime minister Amama Mbabazi said that the charity's video gives a 'false impression' and that Joseph Kony is no longer in the country.

'The Kony 2012 campaign fails to make one crucial point clear. Joseph Kony is not in Uganda,' Mr Mbabazi said in a 9-minute video posted on YouTube.

Mr Mbabazi's response came two days 
after Invisible Children co-founder Jason Russell was taken away by San 
Diego police responding to complaints about him cursing, potentially 
masterbating, and hitting the pavement while naked in a busy 
intersection.

The Prime Minister insisted that the Kony 2012 video did not represent the current situation in the east African nation.

Mbabazi said Uganda was on Kony's trail but said they did not 'need a slick video on YouTube... to take notice.'

Taking another page out of Invisible Children's playbook, Mr Mbabazi Tweeted his message at celebrities to attract attention.

He wrote a very similar message to a 
handful of stars: 'As PM of Uganda I invite you to visit the Pearl of 
Africa & see the peace that exists in our wonderful country 
#KonyisntinUganda'.

Among the recipients were Rhianna, Stephen Colbert, Taylor Swift, Ryan Seacrest, Tim Tebow, and Rush Limbaugh.

After fighting off criticism of the 
Kony 2012 video following its instant popularity- and viewership of over
82 million people- Mr Russell's public breakdown will likely cause more
problems for the controversial charity.

TMZ released a close-range video of Mr Russell pacing back and forth along a busy San Diego sidewalk.

He is shown talking to himself, cursing, referencing the devil, clapping, and waving his hands.

He is allegedly being held in a 5150 
psychiatric ward in San Diego, and considering authorities are only 
allowed to hold him for three days, he should be released sometime 
Sunday.

Mr Russell, 33, was calm and 
co-operative when apprehended by police, according to NBC San Diego, but
seemed to be under the influence of alcohol.

Danica has denied that her husband has any substance abuse or drinking problems.

Although he was not charged with a 
crime, officials decided that he should be committed to hospital for 
medical treatment following the incident.

'During the evaluation we learned that we probably needed to take care of him,' a police spokesman said.

Campaigner: Mr Russell on a trip to Africa, where he was first inspired to set up the charity Invisible Children

'So officers detained him and transferred him to a local medical facility for further evaluation and treatment.'

Ben Keesey, chief executive of 
Invisible Children, the charity set up in 2004 by Mr Russell and two 
friends, issued a statement of support for his colleague.

'Jason Russell was unfortunately 
hospitalised yesterday suffering from exhaustion, dehydration, and 
malnutrition,' he said.

'The past two weeks have taken a 
severe emotional toll on all of us, Jason especially, and that toll 
manifested itself in an unfortunate incident yesterday.

Target: Mr Russell's video is aimed at Ugandan rebel leader Joseph Kony

'We will always love and support Jason, and we ask that you give his entire family privacy during this difficult time.'

The charity, which aims to raise 
awareness of the atrocities committed by the Lord's Resistance Army in 
Uganda, sprang to worldwide fame last week after releasing an online 
video entitled 'Kony 2012'.

The 30-minute film, directed by Mr 
Russell, documents the activities of LRA leader Joseph Kony, notorious 
for his reign of terror in central Africa and particularly his use of 
child soldiers.

However, critics claim that the film over-simplifies a complex conflict and diverts attention from more pressing causes.

Father-of-two Mr Russell is an 
evangelical Christian who is described by Invisible Children as 'our 
grand storyteller and dreamer'.
