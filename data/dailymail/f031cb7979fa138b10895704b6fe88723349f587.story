Floods caused by heavy downpours have killed at least 32 people, swept away buildings, vehicles
and roads and forced the evacuation of more than 200 people in
southern Morocco.

Of the confirmed deaths, 24 occurred in the region of
Guelmim, a desert town, the interior ministry said. A further six people remained missing. 

Flooding, which is quite common in the mostly arid desert
region at this time of year, has in the past triggered violent
protests by locals angered by officials slow and ineffective response to the natural disaster.
