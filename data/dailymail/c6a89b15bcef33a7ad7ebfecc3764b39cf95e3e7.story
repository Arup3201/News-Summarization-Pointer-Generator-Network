Bordeaux captain Lamine Sane has issued a come-and-get-me plea to Liverpool boss Brendan Rodgers by revealing he would be keen on sealing a move to Anfield.

Sane, who has played 16 Ligue 1 games for Bordeaux so far this season, is capable of playing at centre back and in midfield.

The Senegal international has stated he is content with life at Bordeaux but has aspirations to play in England.

Reds boss Brendan Rodgers will be keen on bolstering his options during the summer transfer window 

Sane, speaking to beIN Sports, said: 'Honestly, I feel very good at Bordeaux, for the moment.

'It is true that I have always been drawn to England. As for a club: Liverpool. I have always said Liverpool, since my first ever interview. It is a club that I really like.'

Sane's ability to play in defence and midfield could entice Rodgers into making a move for the Bordeaux ace as the Liverpool boss will be keen to purchase players who are capable of playing across his new favoured 3-4-3 formation.

Rodgers' current defensive options include Dejan Lovren - who has struggled to impress since completing his £20million move to Liverpool - and Kolo Toure - who is out of contract in the summer.
