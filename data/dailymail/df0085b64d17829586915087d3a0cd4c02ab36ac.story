Motorists driving through Kuwait could not believe their eyes when it started raining money in the middle of the city.

Thousands of notes flew through the oil-rich city on a busy afternoon earlier this month, and officials have yet to give an explanation as to why, or reveal a source of the cash.

Drivers abandoned their cars in order to get their hands on the notes blowing down the road, and were filmed holding handfuls of notes. 

It is estimated that notes valued between two and three million Dirham were loose - meaning up to £500,000 was blowing in the wind.

The notes were carried by strong winds through Kuwait for several minutes, but locals have got no idea where it came from.

One surprised local described how his wife pulled over her car to film motorists dodging cash collectors on a busy stretch of highway in the city.

He said: 'It was a very windy day. She was stuck in the traffic. She saw all this money.

'It was just raining money. It was 500 AED notes which is worth quite a lot. It was a lot of money.
