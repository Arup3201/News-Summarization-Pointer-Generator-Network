It is a country estate of such beauty that it inspired the composition of one of our best loved hymns.

But the mansion behind ‘All Things Bright and Beautiful’ was the subject of an unholy row in court today over its modernised interior.

Conservation officials failed in their demand for access to Llanwenarth House to check on renovations and were told by the owner: ‘An Englishman's home is his castle.’

Millionaire Kim Davies, 56, told a court how planning inspectors had made up to 20 visits to the country mansion after they feared the Grade II listed property had been given a ‘footballer's wife-style’ makeover.

Dispute: The ivy-clad Llanwenarth House in the Usk Valley near Abergavenny, owned by Kim Davies, has been at the centre of an argument over renovation work that has taken place inside the Grade II listed property

Inspirational: The fittings inside the South Wales county pile include this ornamental whirlpool

But he refused their request for an architectural historian to inspect the Elizabethan manor which is nestled in the idyllic Usk Valley in South Wales, and Brecon Beacons National Park Authority took him to court.

Previous close inspection of the house was carried out by Irish composer Cecil Alexander in 1848, who was so impressed by the surroundings that she wrote one of her most famous and popular pieces.

The ‘purple-headed mountain’ in one verse of the  hymn is thought to refer to  the nearby Sugar Loaf and Blorenge peaks, while ‘the river running by’ in the next line is the River Usk which winds along the valley floor close to the estate’s boundary.

The home is currently for sale at £2.25million but work carried out Mr Davies has come in for close scrutiny.

National Park planning officer Clare Jones told the hearing she had visited the property at least 10 times and wanted to carry out further checks.

She said: ‘The authority has now engaged a conservation expert who needs to advise us about the works that have taken place.

Renovation: Mr Davies has installed a chandelier light in the kitchen of Llanwenarth House. The dispute arose after he refused to allow an architectural historian to inspect the Elizabethan manor to see what changes were being made

Checks: The court heard that council officials made up to 20 visits to the property to assess the work and eventually took out an injunction to make sure no further building took place

‘He will advise the authority if the history of the building has been compromised and on remedial work to put the building back to its original state.’

Mr Davies, a builder and car dealer, bought the house for £675,000 in 2007 and has since spent more than £1million on it.

He admits that a new kitchen and bathrooms have been installed but claims the work falls outside the restrictions on listed buildings.

Planning officials were called in after it was compared to a ‘footballer's wife monstrosity’ which may have damaged the historic gem and an injunction was taken out to stop further work.

Cecil Frances Alexander (nee  Humphreys) was a poet who also penned at least 400 hymns.

She
was born in Dublin in 1818, and spent much of her later life in 
Londonderry and Strabane with her husband, William Alexander, who became
Archbishop of Armagh and Primate of All Ireland.

Mrs
Alexander was a keen supporter of the Oxford Movement, and in 1848 
published Hymns For Little Children, which include three of the most 
popular hymns in the English language: All Things Bright and Beautiful, 
Once In Royal David's City and There Is A Green Hill Far Away.

The book was published in 69 editions and all the profits were given to Irish charities.

She died in 1895 and is buried in Londonderry.

Mr Davies told magistrates in Abergavenny that he had always complied with the regular inspections by the National Park officials.

But he opposed the application for a warrant to enter the property saying: ‘Enough is enough.’

He continued: ‘I have to take a stand. No further work has taken place since their last visit.

‘My sister is suffering from cancer and is convalescing at my home at the moment.

‘They have been there up to 20 times and I'm not prepared to let them come again.’

Dr Charles Mynor, representing Mr Davies, told the hearing: ‘There is no evidence of any new works or that anything extra has happened.

‘It seems that the National Park are coming back for another bite of a cherry that has already been bitten on many occasions.’

The magistrates refused to grant the Brecon Beacons National Park a warrant to enter the property and awarded £500 costs to Mr Davies.

Chairman of the bench Dr Christopher Rowlands told the court: ‘Mr Davies has said under oath that no further work has been carried out on the property and on those grounds the application is refused.’

After the case, Mr Davies said: ‘I have always welcomed the National Park people when they have visited my home.

‘But it is my home and there has to be a limit to the number of times they want to have a look around.

‘I would get a letter one day saying they were coming the next. I opposed the warrant because quite simply enough is enough.

‘An Englishman's home is his castle - only in this case it's a Welshman's home.’

Photographs used by the estate agent show the inside of the seven-bedroom house has changed considerably since the time of Mrs Alexander’s visit.

The kitchen has a large chandelier and granite tops while the bathroom boasts an ornamental Jacuzzi bath, and there is nothing Mrs Alexander would recognise about the high-ceilinged cinema room.

Inspiration The 'purple-headed mountains' and 'river running by' of the Usk Valley are referred to in the hymn All Things Bright and Beautiful, penned at Llanwenarth House by Irish composer Cecil Alexander

The estate agent description states: ‘Much of its character still remains yet the expansive home also embodies great comfort and ease of living.’

But the refurbishment work by property developer has not won universal songs of praise.

Before the hearing Monmouthshire county councillor Christine Walby said: ‘The house is an architectural gem and the park authority has a legal obligation to ensure that listed buildings are preserved.

Mrs Alexander, who also wrote Once in Royal David’s City, died in 1895 at the age of 77.

It has been claimed that All Things Bright and Beautiful was also inspired by countryside near Dunster in Somerset, and the poetry of Samuel Taylor Coleridge.

The words in turn influenced the works of James Herriot, who used the ‘all creatures great and small’ line as the title of his books about the life of a vet in the Yorkshire Dales.
