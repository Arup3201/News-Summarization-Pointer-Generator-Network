A bin bag containing severed cats' heads was found dumped on a street near Manchester's famous Curry Mile.

Council bosses in Manchester have launched an urgent investigation and the RSPCA is being contacted.

The discovery was made by a council worker who was responding to complaints over fly-tipping in Rusholme.

He found a single black bin bag containing the animal remains close to Walmer Street East and Basil Street.

A fly-tipping memo sent to to councillors and council officials described the contents of the bag as 'cat heads'.

Chairman at Wythenshawe and Sale East Conservative Association Stephen Woods said the council should launch an immediate investigation into how this has happened.

He said: 'We were all absolutely flabbergasted when we found out about this.

'It's absolutely disgraceful the way they have been treated.'

A Manchester city council spokesman said an investigation was underway following the discovery on Friday.

The spokesman said the find amounted to 'an extreme example of animal cruelty'.

He said: 'This is obviously an incredibly distressing and sickening incident which we are now looking into but this is the first incident of its kind we have come across.

'At this stage we have no way of knowing how these animal parts came to be where they were discovered but we will be contacting the RSPCA as this is clearly an extreme example of animal cruelty.'
