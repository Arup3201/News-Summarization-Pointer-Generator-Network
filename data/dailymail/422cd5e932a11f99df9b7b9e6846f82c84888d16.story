More than 200 breastfeeding mothers descended on a cafe in support of one of their own who claimed she was verbally abused by a waitress for suckling her baby in public.

Kelly Schaecher, 28, claims she was told by a member of staff: 'Don’t you ever come back to my cafe with your t*** out again!'

When word spread about her ordeal, a Facebook page set up by mothers calling themselves 'lactivists' and 'mother suckers' called on like-minded women to take a stand by deliberately breastfeeding there.

Show of strength: Hundreds of mothers mobilise before descending on a cafe in Bristol, where one woman claims she was verbally abused for trying to breastfeed her baby

On the march: The group was assembled through a Facebook page set up by mothers calling themselves 'lactivists' and 'mother suckers'

Cheered on by schoolchildren and
monitored by policewomen on horseback, the group marched to the cafe to 
have it out with the owner.

Kelly
said: 'What we did was a peaceful gathering, not a protest and we had a
really good reaction from the police and the public.

'A
group of school children started clapping us and there were six 
policewomen on horseback to make sure no one drifted in the road.'

Kelly
had popped out for lunch at the Park Street Cafe in Bristol, where she 
claims she was told by the waitress that if she wanted to feed her baby 
she would have to sit in the corner.

Breast is best: Kelly Schaecher leads the group to the cafe after claiming she was told never to come back there 'with your t*** out again'

Swamped: The protesters gather at the entrance of the Park Street cafe, monitored by policewomen on horseback to ensure they did not stray into the road

Crossing the threshold: The first mothers enter the cafe to give the owner a 'peaceful' piece of their mind

On leaving, Kelly, from Clifton, Bristol, told two customers about the cafe's breastfeeding policy who promptly turned around and left.

Kelly claimed she then walked a few minutes down the road when she was pursued in a car by a waitress at the cafe who screamed: 'Don’t you ever come back to my cafe with your t*** out again!'

Kelly, who works in procurement at the University of Bristol, said: 'When this happened, I was absolutely terrified and really shocked. I was only breastfeeding, and Bristol is a really family-friendly city.

'You see girls in nightclubs barely wearing any clothes all the time, so why would someone have a problem with me feeding my child?

'I turned around and said to her “You don’t know what’s coming" even though at this stage I had no idea we were going to assemble in the cafe.'

Sit-in protest: The cafe's owner was really apologetic and gave everyone a free tea or coffee and a free cake

Taken aback: Kelly Schaecher (right) was initially told to breastfeed in the corner when she first went for lunch at the cafe and told others about her ordeal, prompting word to quickly spread

Taking a stand: Emily Sinclair makes her point by breastfeeding her baby during the sit-in protest

Although Kelly was distressed by what had happened, she decided not to pursue anything.

Kelly had never met the person who started up the Facebook page, but word spread about her ordeal very quickly.

She said: 'The cafe's owner was really apologetic and gave everyone a free tea or coffee and a free cake.

'He can't help it if one of his staff was rude to me and he has now put up a sign saying "Breastfeeing is allowed in here".'

Davide Pontini, 35, general manager of the Park Street Cafe, said: 'We want to make it clear that we welcome all mothers and we have women breastfeeding in here on a daily basis.

'It's not company policy for us to make women breastfeed in the corner. This was simply an isolated incident due to a misunderstanding.'

Apologetic: Cafe owner Davide Pontini said the nicident involving Kelly Schaecher was a misunderstanding and has now put a sign up saying breastfeeding is welcome
