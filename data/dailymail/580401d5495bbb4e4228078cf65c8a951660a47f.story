With his wide features, strong jaw and confident grin he looks every inch like Jack Nicholson.

But it is not the three-time Oscar winner, 77 - whose unruly hair, scruffy beard and extra pounds obscure his trademark good looks – but rather his 22-year-old son.

The youngest of the actor’s four children, Ray Nicholson is the spitting image of his father in his prime.

And the younger Nicholson hasn’t only overtaken his father in terms of looks, career-wise too, he is ahead of the curve.

At the age of 22, the older Nicholson had just made his debut in 1959’s The Cry Baby Killer, while Ray – who aspires to be a director – already has two assistant director credits to his name, most recently for comedic drama A Reunion that was released in America earlier this year.

The pair were photographed together at the star-studded Apollo in the Hamptons event, where other guests included Sir Paul McCartney, 72, Sting, 62, and Jon Bon Jovi, 52.

Ray is the second of Nicholson’s two children with actress Rebecca Broussard, 51, with whom he was in a relationship with between 1989 and 1994.

A notorious womaniser, Nicholson has two other children, Jennifer Nicholson, 50, from his six year marriage to Sandra Knight between 1962 and 1968, and Honey Hollman, 33, who he fathered during a tryst with Danish model Winnie Hollman.

Actress Susan Anspach, 71, has claimed Caleb Goddard, 44, is also Nicholson’s child but he has not confirmed this.

He has spoken about his changing abilities as a father and that he wishes he had been there more for Jennifer.

He said: ‘I didn’t see enough of my eldest daughter because I was trying to make a career. I have a daughter, Lorraine, and a son, Raymond, with whom I was able to spend much more time.’
