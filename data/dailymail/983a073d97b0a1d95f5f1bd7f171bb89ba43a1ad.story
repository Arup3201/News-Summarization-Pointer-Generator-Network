Jobseeker: Bob Jewers has been rejected from 400 jobs in the last year

A teenager who applied for more than 400 jobs in a year only received four letters of reply and one offer of a job interview.

From pot washer to McDonald's manager Bob Jewers, who has 11 GCSEs, has been turned down for every job he applied for.

The 19-year-old from Darlington, County Durham, said his life was 'hell' and has accused the government of 'wasting an entire generation'.

Mr Jewers said he was forced to abandon a college course after the government scrapped the Education Maintenance Allowance because he couldn’t afford the bus fare.

He immediately started applying for engineering apprenticeships.

But after being repeatedly turned down, and having to move back in with his mother, he widened his search.

Mr Jewers, who has 11 GCSEs at B and C grades and three AS Levels,  then applied for a series of management apprenticeships.

He contacted McDonald's, but, having thought he would be offered an interview, he was surprised when he was rejected.

'I've applied for everything that I know with a bit of training I could do. I'm now applying that I know that I could do, that I'd like to think anyone could do', he said.

'I'm gong for the sort of jobs that I was told were entry level at school.'

He has also applied for standard kitchen and counter positions at various fast food outlets, all of which turned him down.

And the former college student says 
that employers do not tend to respond to applications, leaving 
applicants in the dark as to the reason why they were unsuccessful.

Difficult: Bob Jewers said living on Job Seekers' allowance has been tough, especially since he wants to work

Mr
Jewers said: 'I don't think people realise that it's not as if you apply
for a job then after a week you get a letter for X, Y or Z saying you 
didn't this job because of this, they don't reply.

'I don't think they realise that people are going through a really hard time looking for work. They just think that this person isn't suitable, so we don't need to speak to them.'

Mr Jewers describes the past 11-and-a-half months as 'hell' as he is left wondering when he will be put out of his misery and be given a job.

He said: 'It's the fact that I don't know when it's going to end. When I became unemployed in January, if I was told then that by May I would have a job, I could have got through those five months because I knew when it would end.

'But I don't know when this is going to end, it's like the past year I've done nothing and I've got nowhere, my life's been on hold.'

Mr Jewers said: 'Living on Job Seekers’ Allowance of £53.45 a week is very difficult. I was living with my brother, but I’ve had to move back in with my mum and dad because I couldn’t afford it.

'I want to work, I want to pay tax, I want to feel as though I am contributing to a strong, cohesive British society.'

'I find it almost slanderous that the mass media in this country has portrayed me, and the one million young unemployed people as feckless, work-shy and downright lazy.'
