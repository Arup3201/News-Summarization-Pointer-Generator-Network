An MP who was branded 'boring, snoring' by the editor of Newsnight said she feels 'humiliated and frustrated' and fears the tag will now define her return to politics.

Ian Katz was forced to issue a series of 
humbling public apologies after he slurred Labour's senior frontbencher 
Rachel Reeves to 26,000 followers after an interview on Monday night.

At the end of the first Newsnight since 
the error, Mr Katz, who is only in his second week in the job, decided 
to run #fail next to his Twitter handle @iankatz1000.

But Miss Reeves, shadow chief secretary to the Treasury has now spoken for the first time since the incident and fears that people won't forget the slur. 

Humiliated: Rachel Reeves, right, said she spent all week trying to decide how to respond to Ian Katz's comment and admitted in between the fun and excitement she was 'a bit boring'

Her appearance on the BBC2 show came amid a performance from the Arctic Monkeys and disgraced energy secretary Chris Huhne describing his experience of prison.

But she conceded: 'Maybe in between such fun and excitement I was a bit boring.'

Mr Katz has apologised publicly for the tweet which appeared as part of a conversation with another Twitter user.

The Newsnight editor wrote: 'Tnks … except for boring snoring rachel 
reeves. Playout was fun tho, wasn't it? telly MUCH netter [sic] than 
snooooozepapers innit.'

Serious issues: Rachel Reeves admitted that her discussion about poverty might not have been as flashy as a performance by the band the Arctic Monkeys, which also featured on Jeremy Paxman's BBC show

Miss Reeves said she wanted to put the
interview behind her, and had spent all week trying to decide how to 
respond - other than the one-word 'Thanks...' tweet she sent to Mr Katz 
when she first read his comment.

'I just want to forget about it really,' she told the Guardian.

She said she had spoken to Katz and told him she accepted his apology. She also revealed she had told him she had felt humiliated and frustrated and feared it would define her return to politics.

She added: 'It's no way to talk 
about your guests.'

Miss Reeves said she felt voters would prefer a 'chief secretary to the Treasury who can add up the numbers' to someone displaying 'a fantastic sense of humour or great wit'.  

Steady: Miss Reeves said she felt voters would be happier with a chief secretary to the Treasury who could 'add up the numbers'

Mr Katz initially apologised to Miss Reeves via a private 'DM' (direct message) on Twitter, and with public tweet reading: 'Accidentally sent v ill-judged tweet referring to @RachelReevesMP's appearance on NN. Thought was DM but in any circs wrong. Have apologised.'

But the Labour party demanded a public apology for the slur, which Mr Katz said he though he was sending as a DM but which was instead seen by at least 26,000 followers.

Mr Katz succeeded Peter Rippon, who left the programme following the Jimmy Savile scandal.
