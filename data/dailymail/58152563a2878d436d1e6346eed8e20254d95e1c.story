Staff are leaving an £11million school for boys with 'challenging behaviour' in droves because they fear for their safety, two unions have said.

The headteacher, two teachers, seven governers and eight other members of staff have quit the Foremost School in Harrogate, North Yorkshire, in just one year thanks to inadequate alarms, communication equipment and poor design that prevents them from monitoring pupils.

The £11m facility opened in February to cater for students who have been removed from mainstream education because of difficult behaviour.

Troubled: Foremost School in Harrogate, North Yorkshire, has seen a number of staff leave over safety fears. It caters to boys with behavior problems

Some, the National Union of Teachers (NUT) said, exhibited 'extreme' behaviour.

Sources, quoted by the Daily Star, say staff have been forced to endure threats of violence and physical assaults from pupils.

The school is designed to cater for 40 pupils, but there are just 16 in attendance currently.

The school was opened in February at a cost of £11m. It currently only has 16 pupils

The NUT and Unison both say they have voiced fears to North Yorkshire County Council over the design of the buildings, where staff are expected to maintain 'line of sight' contact with students and colleagues.

Teachers say students can easily give teachers the slip and open fire doors.

One of the sources said: 'The building is such that sometimes we physically lose sight of these children and that's not conducive to maintaining the level of care we are responsible to deliver.'

Other sources spoke of 'serious situations' but declined to go into detail about them. They also said three teachers and the headteacher quit not long after it opened.

Unison's Stella Smethurst said: 'Things are not working well at the school and it's the same issues coming around again and again, relating to the safety of the building, safety of staff and also the pupils.'

North Yorkshire County Council said: 'We have been aware from the earliest stage that Foremost has had a very challenging year.

'Moving students with complex difficulties of this nature into a new school is never easy and the  county council, governors and staff are working hard together to provide a wide range of intensive support to the school’s staff and leadership.'
