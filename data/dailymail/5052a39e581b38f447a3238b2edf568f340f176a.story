A homeless high school student who attracted national attention due to her plight failed to make the finals of a prestigious $100,000 Science contest, but has been given a new home and a scholarship.

Brentwood High School senior Samantha Garvey, 17, was also an invited guest at President Barack Obama's State of the Union address on Tuesday.

Garvey was named a semifinalist last month in the prestigious $100,000 Intel science award, but on Wednesday her name was not among the list of 40 finalists.

All smiles: Samantha Garvey she has won the hearts of a nation, and a new home as well

But the inspirational teenager still believes she is a winner.

In an appearance on Wednesday on the 'Today show, Garvey said the 
presence of so many "historic figures" at the State of the Union address made her want to combine her 
studies in science with policy.

After Garvey's situation came to light, Suffolk County officials announced they were arranging for her family to move into a house. She also appeared on the "Ellen" show, where she received a $50,000 college scholarship.

Samantha Garvey's passion isn't one you might normally associate with a 17-year-old girl.

Chance for a new life: Samantha (second right) with her parents, sister and brother, who have been living in homeless shelters since she was very young

While most of her peers enjoy a good 
gossip and thumb through pages of the latest fashion magazines, she 
loves nothing more than developing her research into mussels and their 
environment.

Samantha's 
work has won her a semi-final place in a prestigious science competition
with a potential $100,000 college scholarship for the winner - and all 
while being homeless.

'Itâ€™s unbelievable,' Samantha told 
ABC News. 'It might as well be the lottery. I want to do better for 
myself. I want a better life.'

The
teenager, who studies at Brentwood High School in New York, and her 
family have been living in shelters since she was very young.

Her parents and two younger siblings had moved into a house seven years ago, but were evicted in February 2010.

Despite not having a desk to carry out 
her studies or a stable home life, Samantha now hopes her work on ribbed
mussels and how they adjust their characteristics in response to their 
environment will help her change her own life.

'I get so excited to tell people about my mussels and crabs that I become a completely different person,' she told ABC News.

Samantha,
who also plays the violin and speaks Italian, has been named one of 300
semi-finalists in the Intel Science Talent Search thanks to her work on
a project called 'The Effects of Physical Environment and Predators on 
Phenotypic Plasticity in Geukensia demissa'.

All those selected as semi-finalists 
will get a $1,000 award, while the 40 finalists, to be announced on 
January 25, will go to Washington, D.C., where last year's finalists met
with President Barack Obama.

Unbelievable: Samantha poses with her mussels which she has been studying for her project on the way they adapt to their environment

Determined: Samantha has a desk at school on which to study, but not at home, making her efforts even more remarkable

Individual: While many teenagers are studying the latest fashions, Samantha has been looking into how mussels adapt to their surroundings

They will also earn scholarships ranging from $7,500 to the top $100,000, according to Intel.

Her father, Leo Garvey, told HLN: She is very special.

'She's a hard worker, very driven and dedicated to anything and everything that she does.'
