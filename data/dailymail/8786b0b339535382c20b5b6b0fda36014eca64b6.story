A suspect has been arrested in connection with the execution of American journalist Daniel Pearl in Pakistan 11 years ago.  

Qari Abdul Hayee, also known as Asadullah, was taken into custody following a swoop by Pakistani paramilitary forces in Karachi on Sunday.

Daniel Pearl was kidnapped and later beheaded by terrorists while working on an investigation in Pakistan four months after 9/11. A grisly video of his death was later posted online. 

New leads: A suspect was arrested on Sunday in relation to the murder of American journalist Daniel Pearl who was abducted and beheaded in Pakistan 11 years ago

Abduction: The kidnap and subsequent murder of Wall Street Journal reporter Daniel Pearl by terrorists in 2002 sent shock waves through the international community who had vehemently campaigned for his release

Hayee is under interrogation and then will be handed over to Pakistani police, authorities told ABC. Officials told the network that they do not believe the suspect carried out the murder but was 'privy' to information.

Hayee, a former leader of the Lashkar-e-Jhangvi militant group in the southern Sindh province, was involved in other attacks in Karachi, according to authorities.

Lashkar-e-Jhangvi is a radical Sunni Muslim militant group that has carried out many attacks in Pakistan, especially against minority Shi'ite Muslims.

9/11 terrorist Khalid Sheikh Mohammed reportedly confessed to murdering Daniel Pearl in 2007 but proof of his involvement is unconfirmed and he has never been charged for the crime.

Mohammed is currently being held at Guantanamo Bay where he in on trial with four accomplices for their roles in the September 11 attacks on the Twin Towers which killed close to 2,800 people.

Daniel Pearl was working as South Asia Bureau Chief for the Wall Street Journal when he disappeared on January 23, 2002. He had been investigating the story of British 'shoe bomber' Richard Reid who had allegedly tried to detonate explosives on a flight from Paris to Miami a month earlier.

Days before he was abducted, Pearl had learned that his wife Mariane was expecting a baby boy.

Mariane remained in Pakistan and campaigned for her husband's release throughout his capture.

Daniel Pearl's death was confirmed on February 21, 2002. There were outpourings of grief from political and religious leaders, along with ordinary people around the world, who had campaigned for his release.

Three months later, Mariane gave birth to the couple's son Adam.

Four kidnappers were convicted of Pearl's murder on July 15, 2002 but authorities have always believed that others were involved in the journalist's death.

Marianne Pearl wrote a memoir entitled A Mighty Heart about her late husband's life which was adapted into a film starring Angelina Jolie as Mariane Pearl and Dan Futterman as the journalist.
