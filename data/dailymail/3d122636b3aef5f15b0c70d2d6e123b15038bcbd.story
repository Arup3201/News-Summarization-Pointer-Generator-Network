Plenty of people probably chose to call in sick after the Super Bowl this week, but one young father probably had a better excuse than most.

Kyle Messier won $100,000 on the Idaho lottery after buying two $10 tickets - and straight away called his boss at a fast food restaurant and quit his job flipping burgers.

'I guess you could say I called in rich,' he said.

Life-changing: Father Kyle Messier has quit his job working in a burger bar after winning $100,000 on the lotto

The father from Post Falls had tried to buy a $20 
lottery ticket from the Frontier Grocery store, but the shop didn’t have
any so he bought two $10 tickets instead.

It proved to be a winning decision when he discovered he had won $100,000 on the Ultimate Bankroll game.

'I
got in the car with my best friend and started playing the tickets when
I realized I’d won,' said Mr Messier. 'My friend and I started 
hugging right there in the car! I couldn’t believe it.'

After quitting his job, he says he now plans to pay for himself and his fiancee to attend college with their winnings.

Mr Messier, who has lived in Post Falls all his life, said he had dreamed of starting trade college, but didn't have enough money despite working long, extra hours at his job.

He had planned to work for two or 
three more years to save the money for his education and put his 
fiancée through school first.

But now the couple are planning to get married at the end of February and both can attend school to learn a profession and find better-paying jobs.

'Wow, that’s about six years of salary at my old job,' Mr Messier said. 'This is a dream come true and couldn’t have come at a better time.'

Frontier Grocery in Post Falls will receive a $10,000 bonus from the Idaho Lottery for their part in selling the winning ticket.
