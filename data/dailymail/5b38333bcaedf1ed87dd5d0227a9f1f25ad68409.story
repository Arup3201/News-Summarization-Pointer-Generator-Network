Neymar will be looking to prove he is up there with all the great Brazil No 10s down the years - even Pele - by inspiring his side again over dangerous Mexico.

How better to weave his name into the pantheon of greats than with a special ‘Brazilian’ free kick? Many of the most enduring memories of World Cups have been stunning goals from free kicks, not least by Brazilians.

But so far we’ve not seen a direct set piece fly in from 20 taken, whereas in last season’s Premier League one in 12 hit the back of the net.

The time is now: Neymar has the opportunity to put himself up there as one of Brazil's greatest ever No 10s

Former England boss Fabio Capello leads Russia into their campaign against South Korea as the only nation at the finals who don’t have any players playing outside their country.

Meanwhile, Belgium kick off their tournament against Algeria as dark horse contenders for many.

So many of their team are familiar faces to an English audience, with Chelsea’s Eden Hazard very much the jewel in the crown; but how has this happened?

After crashing out of the 1998 finals at the group stages, the Belgium federation came up with a blueprint for the future, written by coach Michel Sablon. Those at the FA who strive to improve the standard of the English football ought to read it.

A significant section is how to nurture young players. Key Stage 1 is for five-seven year olds based on making football fun, learning step then encouraging dribbling and passing through progressive small-sided games up until eleven-a-side. It’s when they approach 11 that players learn to operate in a 4-3-3 system.

Premier League class: Chelsea's Eden Hazard is Belgium's talisman figure as they face Algeria on Tuesday

To be feared! Big targetman Romelu Lukaku is likely to lead the line for Marc Wilmots' side

Algeria striker Islam Slimani could well test the credentials of Belgium.

West Ham boss Sam Allardyce will be watching with interest. Having been rejected again by Belgium’s Romelu Lukaku in an attempt to take him on loan from Chelsea, the Hammers could make another attempt to lure Slimani from Sporting Lisbon.

The Golden Boot at the last two World Cups has been won with five goals.

But with Thomas Muller, who claimed the prize in 2010, upping the ante to two-goal Neymar, Robin van Persie and Arjen Robben with his opening game hat-trick it looks like the eight Brazil’s Ronaldo hit at the 2002 finals could be challenged.

And with such a good start, the 10 hit by Gerd Muller in 1970 is not impossible. The record 13, which France’s Just Fontaine struck in 1958, still looks safe.

It’s always hard to measure the star quality of a tournament, but there is a strong case that this has been the best start to a World Cup ever.

Certainly this is on a different planet to the drab opening of South Africa 2010 where after 12 games there had been just 20 goals. So far there have been 41 from 12 games - a ratio of 3.4 per game. That’s the highest since 1958.

So far the games have been so absorbing and entertaining - even the first goalless draw between Nigeria and Iran - that there have been few sightings of the Mexican Wave. That’s always a sure sign when fans have started to get bored with events on the pitch.

The ripple effect ovations are credited to have started at the 1986 World Cup finals in Mexico, although apparently it had appeared at American football games for a few years before that. It first got a run out at a University of Washington Homecoming Game in 1981, led by UW Husky ‘Yell Leader’ Rob Weller and UW Marching Band director Bill Bissell.

World Cup Memory

Just as it seemed Belgium would take England to penalties at the 1990 World Cup, Paul Gascoigne sent over a cross which David Platt converted with a stunning volley on the turn. In many ways it is the goal that changed the face of English football.
