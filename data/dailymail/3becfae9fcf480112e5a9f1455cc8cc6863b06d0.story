The Alabama boy held hostage for almost a week by crazed survivalist Jimmy Lee Dykes celebrated his sixth birthday on Wednesday with a homecoming party attended by the SWAT team, FBI agents and hostage negotiators who had carried out his dramatic rescue just hours before.

The boy, identified only as Ethan, was kidnapped from his school bus by 65-year-old Dyke and held hostage in a nearly week-long standoff near Midland City, Alabama.

The FBI hostage team rushed the booby-trapped underground bunker where Ethan was being held on Monday afternoon after they became increasingly concerned for his safety.

A dramatic gunfight ensued in which Dykes, who fired
the first shot, was killed. Ethan was physically unharmed during the ordeal.

On Wednesday, Ethan celebrated his sixth birthday at a local church filled with family and friends as well his rescuers.

The party, which doubled as a homecoming celebration, had 'Welcome home Ethan' signs hanging on the walls.

Young Ethan, who showed no visible signs of his traumatic ordeal just days earlier, looked to be having fun as he smiled for photos and played with toy cars at the party.

His adult brother Camren Kirkland has revealed that during the boy’s time in captivity the family received regular text messages from the hostage negotiators updating on Ethan's well-being.

'We did know when, at times, he was asleep and that was normally around nine o'clock at night,' Kirkland told ABC News.

He said the updates provided the family with a lot of comfort during the ordeal.

'I could actually go lay my head down,' he said.

He also revealed that the whole family was together when they received a phone call from the FBI agents to informed them that Ethan had been rescued and was coming home.

On Monday afternoon, authorities executed their meticulous plan with military precision after learning the underground bunker was rigged with explosives which they believed Dykes was preparing to detonate.

The hostage team seized their chance when the Vietnam veteran climbed an eight-foot ladder to get supplies and as he reached up, he became off balance and vulnerable.

With Ethan away from the ladder and safe, agents dropped two stun grenades into the hole to disorientate Dykes and within seconds they had stormed the bunker.

A firefight ensued and the survivalist fired the first shot. After the raid, the FBI found two 
explosive devices - one which was lodged in the PVC pipe used to lower 
supplies to the underground bunker which have now been safely detonated.

Neighbors said they heard what sounded like explosions and gunshots, though the FBI and local authorities didn't say how many shots were fired and by whom. No officers or agents were injured, Pack said.

MailOnline was the first to report 
that security forces had altered their plans to use the PVC pipe as a 
route for a hidden camera after discovering that it was wired with 
explosives.

According to the FBI 
initial investigations suggest that, 'The subject reinforced the bunker 
against any attempted entry by law enforcement.'

The FBI special agent running the rescue raid has revealed that Dykes left 
behind written notes and  had become 
more and more agitated the longer that he was in the bunker.

'At the end of the day, the responsibility is mine,' he said. 'I thought the child was going to die.'

Authorities continue their investigation on Friday at the site where Ethan was held hostage in an underground bunker before being rescued Monday

The bunker where Jimmy Lee Dykes held Ethan hostage for seven days. Police used the PVC pipe to communicate with Dykes, who was three feet underground

For days, officers passed food, medicine, toys and other items into the bunker, which was similar to a tornado shelter and apparently had running water, heat and cable television.

After her son's rescue, Ethan's mother said: 'For the first time in almost a week,
I woke up this morning to the most beautiful sight - my sweet boy. 

'I
can't describe how incredible it is to hold him again. Ethan is safe 
and back in my arms - and I owe it all to some of the most 
compassionate people on Earth.'

The
mother, who has yet to be identified, has asked that the family's privacy 
be respected in order to give them time to heal, move forward and 'put 
the nightmare behind them'.

Ethan's grandmother has also spoke to the media to say that though Ethan is OK physically, the ordeal could 
stay with him the rest of his life.

'We know he's OK physically, but we don't know how he is mentally,' said Betty Jean Ransbottom, the boy's grandmother. She added that she feared the ordeal would stay with the child the rest of his life.

Ransbottom said she cried herself to sleep every night while the boy was being held hostage, and didn't sleep much while she awaited for news.

'It was horrible. I never went through anything so horrible,' she said.

She said an FBI agent 
stayed with the family the entire time the boy was being held hostage by
Jimmy Lee Dykes, but officials are not giving the family much 
information because of the ongoing investigation.

They learned of his rescue when an FBI agent at the scene called the agent staying with the family.

Debra
Cook, Ransbottom's sister, said the family was grateful for the 
community's prayers and support. Fliers around town asked people to pray
for the boy, and others gathered at nightly vigils to pray for his safe
return.

'He has gone through a terrible ordeal, and I don't know if he will ever get over it,' Cook said. 'I just want him to be all right.'

Details of the rescue operation emerged today after it was revealed an elite team of FBI agents built a mock bunker and inserted a spy camera into the lair to rescue Ethan after a week of meticulous and secretive planning.

The FBI Hostage Rescue Team blew the doors off the bunker and shot dead the survivalist during the daring raid on Monday afternoon after footage from a secret hi-tech camera showed the boy’s life was in ‘imminent danger’.

Agents became increasingly concerned the 65-year-old's behavior would turn violent after their negotiations with him 'deteriorated' in the final 24 hours.

FBI Special Agent Steve Richardson said: 'Dykes was observed holding a gun.

'At this point,
the FBI agents, fearing the child was in imminent danger, entered the 
bunker and rescued the child.'

Special agent Richardson said: 'I've been to the hospital. I visited with Ethan. He is doing fine.

'He's 
laughing, joking, playing, eating, the things that you would expect a 
normal five-to-six-year-old young man to do. He's very brave, he's very 
lucky, and the success story is that he's out safe and doing great.'

Happy: Ethan's great aunt Debra Cook, right, and uncle, Berlin Enfinger, spoke to ABC of the family's relief that he is safe and well

It was also revealed today that Ethan's mother asked the FBI not to kill Dykes, a Vietnam war veteran, if they could help it because she believed he was not a well man.

State Sen Harri Anne Smith revealed: 'She put her hand on the officer's heart and said, "Sir, don't hurt him. He's sick".'

The boy's great aunt and uncle have also spoken out about the family's relief that Ethan is back and safe.

Debra Cook said: 'If I could, I would do cartwheels all the way down the road. I was ecstatic. Everything just seemed like it was so much clearer.

'You know, we had all been walking around in a fog and everyone was just excited. There's no words to put how we felt and how relieved we were.

Ethan was physically unharmed during the ordeal, but his family have some concerns about how it may impact him mentally in the years to come

'He is so happy to be home, we all are, and he looks great. His mom said everything is fine.'

She said her nephew is the kind of boy who lights up a room whenever he enters it and is always going 90mph.

As for Dykes, the family did not know him personally but believed he was well-known in the community for having many issues.

Speaking
last night Sheriff Wally Olson, who has been on the site almost 
constantly since Ethan's abduction and the shooting of school bus driver
Mr Charles 'Chuck' Poland, said: 'He's a very special child who's 
endured a lot and by the grace of God he's okay.'
