David Cameron is seen enjoying a meal at home with his family and watching his son play football in the Conservative Party's first general election broadcast.

The theme of the film is children and features a number of parents outlining their hopes for their offspring.

At the end, the prime minister says what he wants for his own children, he also wants for every child in Britain.

The prime minister says that what he wants for his own children, he also wants for every child in Britain

He says: 'Like every parent, I have hopes for my children and dreams for their future.

'What I want for them, I want for every child in this country - a good education, a decent job, great public services, a home of their own and overall, a chance to make the most out of their life.

'So that is what our plan for Britain is all about, securing a better future for your family and for all our children and grandchildren.'

The broadcast is the first of five to be released over the course of the election campaign.

A Conservative Party spokeswoman confirmed all those featured in the clip - including in the voice overs - are real people rather than actors.

The film also features David Cameron enjoying a meal at home with his wife Samantha (pictured) and children

In it, the party pledges to clear the deficit, back businesses so they can keep creating jobs and opportunities, keep investing in the NHS, deliver three million apprenticeships, deliver a good primary school place for every child, extend Help to Buy, continue to increase the state pension and protect pensioner benefits.

Yesterday, it emerged Hollywood actor Martin Freeman is fronting a Labour election broadcast in which he praises the party's values and attacks the Conservatives for having 'sod-all to offer the young'.

The Tories mocked the omission of any mention of party leader Ed Miliband during the film and criticised the decision to engage Freeman after controversy over his partner Amanda Abbington's tax affairs.
