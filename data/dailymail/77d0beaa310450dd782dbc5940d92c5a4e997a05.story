This is the moment a woman slaps an aide of sleazy pick-up 'expert' Julien Blanc as tempers flare over the controversial American's seminars.

The incident which happened after one of Blanc's talks had to be cancelled when an angry mob gathered outside a venue in Melbourne occurred just hours before Blanc was kicked out of Australia for his 'abhorrent views'.

The footage, uploaded to YouTube, shows an angry woman berate Blanc's assistant - known only as RSD Max - as the crowd chanted 'sexual assault is not OK'.

The woman, sporting green dreadlocks then slaps the man around the face before being dragged back by a member of the crowd.

Blanc, who once described how his choking pick up technique makes him seem like a 'rock star celeb' with a 'f***ing attractive, like, magnetic personality' and encouraged his followers to be more like the comedian Russell Brand, was forced to leave Australia on Thursday after Immigration Minister Scott Morrison cancelled his visa.

'This guy wasn't pushing forward political ideas, he was putting a view that was derogatory to women and that's just something that our values abhor in this country,' Mr Morrison told Sky News. 

Blanc was pursued by a socal media campaign - #TakeDownJulienBlanc - throughout his visit to Australia.

He had arranged to hold a seminar on his methods for picking up women on a boat along Southbank in Melbourne, but after a crowd of demonstrators turned up and demanded they shut the event down, Melbourne River Cruises cancelled the event. 

Controversial pick-up artist Julien Blanc was evicted from Australia on Friday
