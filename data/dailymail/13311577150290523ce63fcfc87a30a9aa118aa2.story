Ralph Ellis runs you through what we 
learned from the weekend's football. This week, West Ham supporters show their frustrations with Sam Allrdyce's tactics, David Moyes' original back four provided Ryan Giggs with victory in his first game in charge of Manchester United while Cardiff have lost the ability to defend set-pieces...

1. The frustration of West Ham fans with manager Sam Allardyce’s route one tactics is perhaps explained by the stats for their 1-0 defeat at West Brom.

Left back George McCartney did play the ball 11 times to winger Matt Jarvis just in front of him – but after that the most successful passing combination in the team was goalkeeper Adrian’s eight long punts to the head of Andy Carroll.

Carroll won seven flick-ons – more than any other striker in the Premier League on Saturday – but only four of them went to a team mate.

2. Cardiff started the season as set-piece experts at both ends of the field, but since Malky Mackay moved on have lost the ability to defend them.

Connor Wickham’s header from a Seb Larsson corner that bounced in the six yard box was the pivotal moment of the 4-0 thrashing of Sunderland, whatever the debate about Juan Cala’s red card.

Until Mackay was sacked by owner Vincent Tan on December 27 the Welsh side had conceded just four set-piece goals in 18 Premier League matches – in the 18 following his dismissal they have let in ten.

3. David Moyes picked the same back four - Jones, Ferdinand, Vidic and Evra - in all of his first three Premier League games as Manchester United manager.

But that defensive line-up never began together again until Ryan Giggs named them against Norwich in Saturday night’s 4-0 win over Norwich, when the Reds kept their first clean sheet in a League game at Old Trafford since January.

4. The red card shown to Ryan Shawcross by Andre Marriner in Stoke’s 1-0 home defeat by Tottenham means there are now only two outfield players who have appeared in every minute of every Premier League game for their club.

One is Cardiff and England centre-half Steven Caulker, the other Crystal Palace midfielder Mile Jedinak.

Neither will be looking for a rest when the season ends on May 11, though.  Caulker hopes to be in Roy Hodgson’s World Cup squad, while 29-year-old Jedinak is captain of Australia’s squad to play in Brazil

5. Jack Cork has been a bit of an unsung hero at Southampton while England new boys Adam Lallana, Jay Rodriguez and Luke Shaw have been gaining all the attention.

The 24-year-old son of Wimbledon FA Cup winner Alan has been a consistent performer in midfield and took a starring role with both the quantity and quality of his work in the win over Everton.

He covered eight miles – the furthest run by any Premier League player on Saturday – but also contributed the most attacking passes of any Saints player including making two chances for team mates.

6. Don’t know if veteran Wigan defender Emmerson Boyce has an appearance money clause in his contract – but if not he should have.

The 34-year-old made his 54th appearance of the season in the 2-0 home defeat by Blackpool that leaves Uwe Rosler’s team clinging on to the last play-off place in the Championship.

Rosler says tiredness shouldn’t be a problem for the Latics because the squad has been rotated in their 60 games this season at home and in Europe– but Boyce and fellow defender Leon Barnett who has played 50 matches seem to have been excluded from that policy.

7. Getting Pablo Hernandez fit again has been a key for Swansea boss Garry Monk in the run of ten points from six games that has secured the club’s Premier League future.

The Spaniard spent much of the campaign in and out of the side with hamstring trouble, and the 4-1 win over Aston Villa was only the second time he’s finished all 90 minutes of a League game this year.

He proved his value – as well as scoring the Swans crucial third goal he gave the ball away only once in the entire game.

8. Striker Chris Martin was allowed to leave Norwich on a free transfer to Derby last summer after Chris Hughton spent a club record £8.5million on Ricky Van Wolfswinkel.

The 25-year-old, never given a real chance at Premier League level after helping the Canaries win back to back promotion, hasn’t looked back since.

He got his 20th Championship goal in the 4-2 win over Watford which guaranteed Steve McClaren’s side third place in the table.

9. When Shaun Derry decided in February he needed a new captain for his struggling Notts County side, he turned to fellow Irishman Alan Sheehan.

It’s proved a good move – the popular 27-year-old left back has been an inspiring leader in an astonishing run of six wins in eight games that has lifted the club out of the relegation zone.

Saturday’s 2-0 win over Sheehan’s old club Swindon, in which he scored one of the goals, means County now need a point at Oldham on the final day to stay up.

10. Gamble of the weekend came from Northampton manager Chris Wilder, who handed 18-year-old striker Ian Toney only his second start in League football for the must-win trip to Dagenham.

It paid off handsomely as the teenager, who was the youngest ever to play for the Cobblers when he made his debut at 16, scored twice in a 3-0 win.

Northampton, six points from safety when Wilder left promotion chasing Oxford to take over in January, now need a point at home to his old club to stay up after taking 28 points from 19 matches under his command.

Without him Oxford have sunk like a stone – just eight points from the last 14 matches means they won’t even finish in the play-off places after once looking certainties to go up automatically.
