A rugby union team was left stranded on a busy motorway after their team bus caught fire en route to a match.

Players and officials from Worcester Warriors were travelling to a friendly match against Ospreys in south Wales when their bus caught fire on the M5.

Passing motorists took pictures showing the back of the Aviva Premiership side's bus engulfed by the ferocious blaze.

Speaking to The Daily Telegraph, the team's captain Jonathan Thomas admitted the incident left the team shaken.

'I feel lucky to be alive to be honest', he said.

'We were going along and the bus starts driving along the hard shoulder and Dean Ryan [Worcester director of rugby] comes on the mic at the front of the bus and says, "Don’t panic but get off as quick as you can".

Incredibly, the team's friendly match still went ahead, but with a later kick-off time of 4.30pm.

Following the incident, the club said via their twitter account: 'The Warriors team bus caught fire on the M5 this morning.

'Discussions are taking place to determine whether the match will go ahead.

'All players and staff are safe and well.

'We will let fans know as soon as a decision regarding the match has been made.'

Saturday’s contest was the club’s final warm-up before their Aviva Premiership campaign starts with a match at Leicester on September 8.
