Here's a unique way to find your next date.

Canadian engineer James Befurt was tired of wasting time on Tinder, so he decided to take matters into his own hands.

Using a computer programme, along with a clever motor setup and a stylus, the Vancouver, British Columbia-based Java developer came up with a way to get through as many of his potential soulmates as quickly as possible.

Befurt has developed a contraption and computer programme that will automatically swipe right on Tinder

Apple recently revealed that Tinder was one of the most downloaded apps of the year.

And - until now - it required users' undivided attention while perusing profiles.

But Mr Befurt's hilarious contraption allows Tinder fans to swipe right forever - or at least until they run out of potential matches near them.

He currently lives in Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada, though originally from the town of Kamloops, BC, which is approximately 350 km away.

The clever motor setup uses a stylus, making it possible to approve profiles without paying any attention

Watch as his device swipes right for all of eternity - or until he runs out of matches in his selected area

This isn't the first time that a savvy user has attempted to hack the app.

Back in September, Business Insider reported on a man who had built a Google Chrome extension to transform Tinder into a desktop interface so that he could more easily swipe through potential matches. 

Tinder, estimated to be worth around £1billion, was founded in September 2012 and recruits up to 20,000 new users every single day.
