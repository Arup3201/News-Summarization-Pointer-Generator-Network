Crew members from the Royal Navy's most advanced attack submarine have been reunited with their families as HMS Astute returned from her maiden deployment.

More than 100 submariners were welcomed back to HM Naval Base Clyde at Faslane.

The vessel left Scotland in February to become the first Astute Class submarine to contribute to the UK's presence in the Mediterranean.

Commanding Officer Gareth Jenkins said the deployment had been a "huge success".

He added: "The ship's company has been outstanding and I am pleased that so many of their families are here today to welcome them back to the home of the submarine service."

The Duchess of Cornwall, known as the Duchess of Rothesay in Scotland, will later be given a tour of the submarine and attend a reception at the base.

During her eight months at sea, HMS Astute travelled more than 27,000 miles and took part in counter-smuggling operations and an international exercise.

The deployment saw seven men qualify as submariners, including 19-year-old Connor Campbell from Dunfermline in Fife, who was met at Faslane by his proud parents, sister and girlfriend.

He said: "It was quite exciting getting off the boat and seeing everyone. It's been hard work but it's definitely been worth it.

"You get used to the conditions after a while. Now I'm just looking forward to getting home and relaxing."

His mother Jane, 44, said: "It feels great to have him back. I'm very proud of him."

Thomas Bett, 26, from Anstruther in Fife, said what he missed most while at sea was his own bed.

He said: "It's not that bad – you have a Mess you can sit in and the food's ok. The main thing I miss is my double bed - it's more comfortable."

Mr Bett was welcomed home by sister Nicola, 37, and her husband, with whom he lives.

She said: "It's fabulous to be here and see him come off the boat. It's been hard and we've missed him, but I've not missed the washing."

Astute was launched in June 2007 at BAE Systems in Barrow-in-Furness and was commissioned during a ceremony at Faslane attended by the duchess, the boat's sponsor, in August 2010.

Faslane is the home of the UK submarine service and all seven of the Class vessels – Astute, Ambush, Artful, Audacious, Anson, Agamemnon and Ajax – will be ported there.

Commodore Michael Walliker, Commander of the Faslane Flotilla, said: "I am delighted to welcome HMS Astute back to her base port at Clyde.

"Her return is the culmination of four years' dedication and commitment by a great many people, both in uniform and in industry to deliver this submarine to the front line."

The 97-metre long Astute is able to circumnavigate the world without surfacing. Its nuclear technology means it will never require refuelling and the submarine can manufacture its own oxygen from sea water.

Lieutenant Commander Rob Tantam, 36, said the returning home was made even better by the exceptionally sunny weather.

The Plymouth-based officer was met by his wife Kate and his sons Thomas, three, and James, five.

He said: "It's been quite a long time away and so it's great to come back and see the families on the jetty, which is not something you're used to on a submarine.

"It's been a great day, especially with the nice weather which is not usual for Faslane."

The duchess, wearing a raspberry-coloured coat with a Rothesay tartan collar, boarded HMS Astute briefly before meeting submariners and their families at a reception where she presented awards to the newly-qualified submariners.

She told the 300 guests: "I'm pleased to see everyone back in one piece. I imagine there's lots of making up to do with wives, sons, brothers and family members.

"I'm proud to be sponsor of HMS Astute and pleased to see everyone home."

Commander Jenkins said: "It was a tremendous honour for my ship's company to be welcomed home by Her Royal Highness and made what was already an auspicious occasion even more special."

Meanwhile, Europe's largest military exercise has begun off the coast of Scotland with involvement from 22 ships and submarines.

Exercise Joint Warrior happens twice a year and is hosted in the UK.

The three Armed Forces and a number of other nations are involved in the exercise to help hone how they all work together.

In addition to the large number of warships, more than 50 aircraft and almost 3,500 people are taking part.

Military chiefs said the exercise allows UK, Nato and allied units to train together in tactics and skills for use in a "combined joint task force".

The exercise runs through a range of scenarios, including crisis and conflict situations that could be realistically encountered in operations, such as disputed territory, terrorist activity and piracy.

Countries taking part are the UK, the United States, the Netherlands, France, Denmark, Norway, Spain, Germany, Lithuania, Belgium, Poland, Estonia and Latvia.
