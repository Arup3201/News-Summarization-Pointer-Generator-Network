Extra-ordinary: Donald McMaster, 91, is Britain's oldest extra

If you are lucky enough to reach the age of 91, you'd be forgiven for wanting to put your feet up in front of the television.

But for one 91-year-old pensioner, that's not enough and he likes to do something a little 'extra' with his time.

Donald McMaster, 91, is Britain's oldest extra and regularly appears in television series.

He has a long list of credits including Still Game, Chewin’ The Fat, Taggart and The High Road - and regularly appears in BBC drama River City in his native Scotland.

And, great-grandfather Mr McMaster, from Faifley, has no intention of retiring anytime soon.

He said: ‘I’m only 91, for goodness sake. I really enjoy it and it can be quite lucrative.

‘Sometimes I get a full week’s work and I have been all over the country for different things.’

Mr McMaster's first taste of acting started before the Second World War when he entertained troops at army camps.

After the war he was working as a photographer when he got his lucky break.

On his way home one night, he saw people filming in a garage, and went in to ask what was going on.

He was told that they were filming for a BBC show.

He said: ‘I decided I should try to get into that and I contacted the Equity, the trade union for arts performers, and they said I could get a stint as an extra for the theatre.

‘I ended up getting an agent and he was soon phoning me up with all sorts of TV work.’

Since then, Mr McMaster has become a memorable face in the background of many shows, starring as a lawyer, a soldier, a minister and a policeman.

He has even appeared in films like A Shot At Glory, which starred Robert Duvall, and Kidnapped alongside Michael Caine.

Despite not having a leading role, or even speaking, Mr McMaster still makes money from old shows and has even been stopped in the street by people who recognise him from the television.

He said: ‘I’m actually still getting royalties from Tinker, Tailor, Soldier, Spy - it isn’t much but it gets shown all over the world.

‘I was getting petrol one day and someone came up to me and said he had saw me in an episode of Taggart in Australia which is absolutely incredible. It gets around.’

Despite his advancing age, Donald has no intentions of completely giving up his roles but admits he has had to cut back on appearances.

He still features regularly on BBC soap River City and gets a wide variety of other offers from all over the country.

Mr McMaster said: ‘I think I’m the oldest extra still working. I know a couple of other older actors but they are only in the 80s.

‘I’m going on 92, so I am getting on a bit now. I am not doing as much as I used to.

‘The way I am now, I wouldn’t take on much work, even though I still get lots of offers.

‘I was recently asked to do a stint for a Scottish Gas advert in Aberdeen but I couldn’t make it.’

‘I still do the odd bits and bobs but River City is quite handy as it’s only 15 minutes from my house by car.’

Lottie Goodwin was previously Britain’s oldest extra and appeared in Emmerdale until retiring in April 2011 aged 99.

She passed away at the age of 100 two weeks ago, just two months before her 101st birthday.
