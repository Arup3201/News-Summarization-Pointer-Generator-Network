Ateltico Madrid fell seven points behind La Liga leaders Barcelona on Sunday as Diego Simeone's reigning Spanish league champions were held to a 1-1 draw at home to Valencia.

Koke drilled Atletico into the lead in the 33rd minute with a fierce low strike from the edge of the area.

But Valencia defender Shkodran Mustafi headed in a cross that goalkeeper Miguel Moya misjudged  in the 78th to deny Simeone's side a sixth straight home league win.

The visitors had Javi Fuego sent-off for a second bookable offence in the final moments but held on for the draw. 

Valencia remain a point behind Ateltico in fourth place.

Simeone elected to begin with Mario Mandzukic on the bench, starting with Fernando Torres in the absence of star striker Antoine Griezmann.

Torres provided the assist for Koke's opener, heading down a free kick from Thiago Mendes for the midfielder to pounce upon.

Torres was replaced by Mandzukic on the hour mark and ten minutes later, Thiago hit the crossbar form close range when he should have doubled Atletico's lead.

It was a costly miss as Mustafi levelled on 78 after a free kick hit the crossbar.

Barcelona replaced Real Madrid at the top of La Liga with a 6-1 win over Rayo Vallecano earlier on Sunday.
