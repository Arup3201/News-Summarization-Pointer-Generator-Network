A Manhattan man claims his boyfriend swindled him out of millions to bankroll a high class lifestyle leaving him with a mere 11 cents to his name.

Daniel Ding claims his former boyfriend Michael Eubank used up his fortune leaving him with nothing, and now he's taking him to court. 

Ding claims Eubank blew his cash on luxury cars and Vegas trips when not working at his job in finance.

But now the pair have split, Ding tells the Post, and he's reduced to squatting at a West 30th Street property.

According to court papers Eubank 'continuously abused Ding's trust for his own individual gain.'

Eubank, an interior designer, says there's no basis for the suit.

'There's a lot of lies and perjury going on in this,' he says.

The 27-year-old Ding says Eubank convinced him that the couple should have a joint account, except Eubank only made withdrawals on Ding's $1.2 million contribution without depositing any money of his own.

Now Ding says he's broke. 

Eubanks, however, claims Ding drained the finances all on his own.
