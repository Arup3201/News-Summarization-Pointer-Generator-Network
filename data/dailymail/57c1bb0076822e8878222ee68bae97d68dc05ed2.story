Sabrina Hirst was jailed for the manslaughter of her daughter, Tiffany Wright, in 2008 but has since been freed to start a new life, it emerged today

A killer mother who let her three-year-old daughter die malnourished and alone  was allowed out of prison just four years after she was jailed for 12 years, it emerged today.

Sabrina Hirst allowed little Tiffany Wright to die in a squalid bedroom and, according to the judge who sentenced her, seemed to care more about her dogs than her daughter.

Despite being sentenced to 12 years for Tiffany's manslaughter in 2008, Hirst was allowed out just four years later and even visited Downing Street while on day release, it was reported today.

Tiffany had been dead for about two days when she was found in a room above the Scarborough Arms in Upperthorpe, Sheffield in 2007.  

Police were called after a pub disco ended on a Sunday night and it emerged Hirst had not checked on the youngster since the previous Friday morning.

Police and paramedics found the little girl in a filthy bed in a beetle-infested room, her body covered in insect bites 'looking like a porcelain doll with sunken eyes', a court later heard.

Hirst admitted responsibility for the death and was jailed in 2008 for what trial judge, Recorder Alan Goldsack QC, called 'about as bad a case of child manslaughter as there can be'.

It emerged this morning that Hirst - who has since changed her name to Adelle Shaw - was allowed out on day release just four years later.

She was then freed on licence in 2013 after serving half of her sentence, after time she had spent on remand before trial was taken into account.

The Sun reported that, after hooking up with new boyfriend, RAF airman Rob Donnison,  she was even admitted to Downing Street to have her picture taken outside the famous door of Number 10.

It is believed the couple got through security at the famous street using Mr Donnison's military ID.

The paper reported Hirst now works for a youth support charity in London, where she commutes from her home in Lincoln.

Former friends told the paper her early release was a 'disgrace' and claimed she is fooling people with her new life.

At Hirst's trial in 2008, prosecutor Jeremy Richardson QC said: 'Tiffany had not been seen for about a week by anyone other than her mother before her body was discovered. Much of the time her mother didn't feed Tiffany properly or at all.'

The judge told her: 'One almost unbelievable piece of evidence is that on what was probably Tiffany's last day alive, you were discussing on the phone concerns you had about one of your dog's weight and feeding problems.'

A pathologist said Tiffany's bones showed evidence of significant periods of malnutrition between periods when she had been fed.

Following the publication of the photo of Hirst in Downing Street, a spokesman for the Prime Minister said: 'Members of the armed forces and their families can request to have their photos taken outside Number 10. This is at the discretion of police officers on the gate, during quiet periods.

'Military identification must be shown before access is granted and all visitors are subject to strict security checks before entering. Visitors on this basis are not permitted to enter the building.'
