A student suffering from a tomato ketchup phobia claims her fear is so severe she starts gagging and is scared for her life whenever she comes into contact with the sauce.

Lauren Dodd, a 21-year-old student at Newcastle University, is so terrified of the red stuff she feels sick whenever she sees it - and when a friend accidentally squirted her with some she almost fainted.

Ms Dodd, who is in the third year of her studies, suffers from the extremely rare mortuuequusphobia - the extreme fear of ketchup and tomato-based sauces.

She said: 'I don't know what's wrong with me, but tomato sauce absolutely terrifies me. Whenever I see it, I just start gagging and feel genuinely afraid for my life - my friends say I'm condimental.

'Unsurprisingly, people tend not to understand, but to me it's the worst thing in the entire world - it's scarier than all the horror films rolled into one.'

The journalism student is so afraid of ketchup that she has to leave the room whenever one of her five housemates has some on their dinner - despite not being bothered by brown sauce.

Lauren Dodd lives in fear of tomato ketchup

Dr Sandi Mann, a senior psychology lecturer at the University of Central Lancashire and author of the book 'Overcome Phobias and Panic Attacks', said she was not at all surprised by Ms Dodd's unusual phobia.

She said: 'I'm not surprised, I haven't come across that particular one before but there are all sorts of weird and wonderful phobias.

'I'd use a programme in which you combine relaxation therapy, desensitisation and gradual exposure to the feared stimulus.'

Dr Mann said this involve teaching Ms Dodd the 'relaxation skills' to cope with the anxiety she felt when exposed to ketchup, then creating a hierarchy of what scares her from least to worst - such as a picture of a tomato or a tomato bottle, or the sauce itself.

Finally, she would be gradually exposed to each of these images or products starting with the item which scared her the least.

Dr Mann added: 'She'd learn to manage the stress that that produces. It's like a ladder - you go up each rung at a time so she's completely relaxed about the rung before.

'It's very, very effective as the client is motivated - they want to get it sorted and it can be treated very, very, successful.'

Speaking to student newspaper The Tab, she said: 'I know it's weird, but for me, looking at a bowl of tomato soup is like staring directly into Hell.

'I don't mind brown sauce, I'm fine with mayonnaise and soup isn't an issue for me - as long as it doesn't contain tomatoes.

'I'm even not that bothered with whole tomatoes - it's just when they're all mushed up and evil that it makes me afraid. Even baked beans are too much.'

Oddly, Lauren has no idea where her bizarre phobia came from.

She said: 'It's not like I had a traumatic, tomato-related incident growing up. I never really liked it when I was a child, and then one day it just freaked me out and I started getting really scared of it.

'One time I was out for a meal with a new friend and she didn't know about my fear. Before I could stop her, she got this bottle of ketchup and dolloped it on her plate.

'It splashed and some went on my top but even worse some went on my face.

'I rushed home and threw the top in the bin, but I couldn't throw my face away so I ended up just sitting in the shower and crying. I'm more scared of Heinz 57 then I am of death.'

Phobias can range from the unsurprising - such as the all-too-common fear of spiders - to the truly bizarre.

Barmaid Kirstie Hughes, from Merseyside, watched a horror film featuring a wardrobe as a child. Now as a 20-year-old she can't face looking at a wardrobe. 

But although it may seem unusual, Ms Dodd is not alone in harbouring a fear of sauces.

Lee Sentino, 24, has a physical reaction to all types of sauce or condiment, and refuses to eat any 'wet foods'. The barman from Manchester says he starts gagging, feels sick and breaks out in a cold sweat when he is confronted with ketchup, gravy, custard or HP Sauce.

And a U.S. woman named Shiseido was recently reported to have developed a phobia of the sauce when she was six years old, after her mother chased her around with packets of it as a joke.

A north London teenager who choked on spaghetti as a child is today so terrified of food that she refuses to eat anything apart from chicken escalopes. Charlotte Snow has shunned most other foods since she was three years old, despite her parents' desperate attempts to improve their daughter's diet.

However, such phobias are not restricted just to the young - Bradford, Yorkshire mother-of-four Zoe Ingleson has spent the past 20 years dreading mealtimes because of her fear of metal cutlery.

Other unusual phobias to have been detailed in recent months include a fear of Guiness, onions - and even an irrational phobia of certain noises such as chewing.

And perhaps most remarkably, last year a man claimed to have a phobia of the Kardashian family.

Retail assistant Mike Amess, from Exeter, claims to break out in a cold sweat whenever he sees or hears the famous family and says the sight of a semi-naked Kim even makes him vomit with disgust.

He explained: 'Just hearing the sound of the Kardashians' nasal voices or catching a glimpse of them on screen makes me feel nauseous and shaky. My hands get clammy, my breathing gets heavier and I start sweating. Sometimes, I get teary and want to retch.'
