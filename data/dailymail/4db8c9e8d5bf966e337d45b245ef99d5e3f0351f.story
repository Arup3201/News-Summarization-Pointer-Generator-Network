This is the shocking moment a baby was allowed to crawl perilously close to the edge of a steep cliff in Norway so that her parents could snap a keepsake photograph.

Dressed in a pink outfit and cap, the young child was accompanied by four adults, who were at least a few feet away from her, and would have faced certain death if she had rolled in the wrong direction.

Hiker Fred Sirevag, who snapped the chilling photo on Saturday afternoon, said he couldn’t believe his eyes when he encountered the scene as he made his way up to Preikestolen (Pulpit Rock), a steep cliff that has a 1,982ft drop.

Shocking: A baby crawls along the edge of a steep cliff in southern Norway while an adult snaps a keepsake photograph

Mr Sirevag’s photo has been circulated online and in the Norwegian press, leaving people shocked and outraged that the baby was put in a dangerous situation at the tourist attraction.

He and his 11-year-old daughter were sitting down in a safe spot nearby when the family placed the baby, unaware of the danger that she faced, on the mountain ledge.

He told MailOnline Travel: ‘I saw the mother and she was putting the baby down close to the edge and backing up a little bit so the other lady could get a clean photo of the baby and the Pulpit Rock in the background. 

‘It’s a straight drop. You don’t want to go too close because it’s pretty scary. You’d be pretty much dead if you fall down there.’

Mr Sirevag snapped the photo and considered walking down to say something to the group, but they scooped up the baby and moved on.

He added: ‘I was very shocked. It was over so quickly, I could hardly react.'

Mr Sirevag added: ‘I think they put the baby into a great risk. A baby can easily tip around and it’s really unpredictable and you never know when that will happen.

‘If the baby fell away from the mommy I don’t know if she could have caught the baby.

‘I thought this was such a crazy thing to do that people should know about this. It should never happen.’ 

Preben Falck, CEO of the Stavanger Tourist Association, encouraged people to use extreme caution when they hike up to Pulpit Rock.

He told the Norwegian News Agency: ‘I have taken my children to Preikestolen and kept them at a safe distance away from the edge. 

'All parents are different, but I wouldn't look after my children like that.’ 

Tourist draw: Tens of thousands of people visit Preikestolen, known as Pulpit Rock, in Forsand, Norway every year

Pulpit Rock towers over a fjord in the municipality of Forsand and is one of Norway’s most popular attractions, drawing tens of thousands of holidaymakers every year. 

Last year, a Spanish man plunged to his death while taking photos, reigniting the debate over whether a security fence should be installed to protect visitors.

But Falck believes a fence or signs would spoil the experience: ‘We cannot put up signs telling that parents should not put their children down near the edge. Nor do I think we should put up fences and secure the area.’
