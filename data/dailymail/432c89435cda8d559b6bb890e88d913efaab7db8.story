A former soldier who tipped the scales at 22st when he left the army has shed almost half his bodyweight - and then coached his girlfriend to do the same.

David Trowsdale, 29, was fit as a fiddle when he served in Afghanistan in 2009 - and even guarded the queen on horseback as part of the Royal Cavalry.

But after leaving the army in 2010, he piled on the pounds and hit 22 stone. After pals teased him about his weight gain, he vowed to shift the excess weight.

Now, after being crowned Cambridge Weight Plan's man of the year, he's set up as a weight loss consultant himself - and has helped girlfriend Laura Stuart shed almost 10st too.

David, from Harlow, Essex, said: 'I just felt as though I'd gone from hero to zero.

'Being in the army meant I didn't really have to worry too much about what I was eating, and I was doing loads of exercise.

'But as soon as I left, I got a job driving, and the pounds just kept piling on.

The trigger for David was taunts from his friends about how much weight he had put on - he hit the gym, changed his diet and is a new man

'One night, I was meeting family and friends in our local pub, and as I walked in, my brother jokingly shouted: "Look at that fat git!"

'I wanted the ground to open and swallow me up. I walked out of the pub and drove straight home - vowing there and then to do something about my weight.

'I couldn't believe how much my life had changed. When people saw me in my uniform, they were always impressed - now I was a laughing stock.

'I researched losing weight online and signed up for the Cambridge Weight Plan - within a few days of starting the diet, I'd lost a stone.'

David has found that since losing weight, people come up to him in the gym and ask him what his secret is

David, pictured in Afghanistan in 2009, said: 'It was so easy to put weight on. I was promised all kinds of jobs when I came out of the army, but none of them materialised into anything'

Within weeks, David had lost 4st - and after hitting the gym, started to lose even more weight.

Now, a year after he started his weightloss plan, he weighs 13st 8lb.

And when his girlfriend, Laura Stuart, 24, saw how much weight he'd lost, she signed up last October - and has dropped from a size 22 to a size 12.

David said: 'When I first started, I was so fat that I was too embarrassed to go to the gym.

'But after I lost a bit of weight, it got easier, and now, people come up to me while I'm working out and ask me what my secret is.

'It was so easy to put weight on. I was promised all kinds of jobs when I came out of the army, but none of them materialised into anything.

'I got depressed and comfort ate constantly, especially when I started a new job as a lorry driver and was working unsociable hours.

'I also met my girlfriend Laura about the same time. She made me really happy and we moved in together - and we loved cooking meals together - meaning we both put weight on.'

After David's weight loss, Laura also signed up - and when David started working as a consultant, his girlfriend was his first client.

Within months, Laura had also shed almost 10 stone - going from 21st 9lb to 13st 7lb - and plans to lose another stone.

Laura said: 'I'd struggled with my weight all my life - I was always trying this diet or that one, and nothing ever worked.

'When I saw how much weight David had lost and how happy he was though, I knew I had to try it for myself.

'In the first week, I lost 11lb - losing weight has completely changed my life.'

David added: 'The first few days of the diet were tough, but once we both started losing weight, it was easy to keep going.

Speaking about his weight loss, David said: 'I feel good about myself when I walk into a room of strangers now - not scared of what they would think of me'

'Our friends and family are amazed - they think we look like a completely different couple.

'It's helped us understand our relationship with food and we'll never go back to our old ways.

'Being crowned man of the year was the icing on the cake. It's tough to believe the difference a year makes.

'I feel good about myself when I walk into a room of strangers now - not scared of what they would think of me. I've gone from hero to zero and back again.'
