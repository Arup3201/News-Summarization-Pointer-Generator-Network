Swimming champion Ian Thorpe has left a rehab facility and has gone home after spending two days being treated for alcohol abuse and depression, Australian news reports.

The five-time Olympic gold medallist has long been battling what he himself called ‘crippling depression’ in his 2013 biography, and was admitted to a Sydney hospital Wednesday.

It has been reported that the 31-year-old Australian athlete left hospital early on Friday morning, after being injured in a fall at his parents’ house in a Sydney suburb, where he has been staying since returning to his home country over Christmas.

Just last week, Mr Thorpe was seen smiling and joking at model and long-time friend Tahyna Tozzi’s wedding, and celebrated Australia Day at a party surrounded by friends.

However, the happy exterior has been hiding several years of trouble, something which Mr Thorpe described in his biography This Is Me: The Autobiography.

He revealed that at some of the worst times he turned to alcohol in a bid to quell the thoughts running about his head.

'It was the only way I could get to sleep,' he wrote. 'It didn't happen every night, but there were numerous occasions, particularly between 2002 and 2004 as I trained to defend my Olympic titles in Athens, that I abused myself this way - always alone and in a mist of disgrace.'

Thorpe says in the book that he was able to hide the effects of alcohol from team-mates and coaches and continued to enjoy one of the best periods of his career, despite his private battle with depression.

The swimmer said he also felt the need to stay silent about his depression, thinking it was a 'character flaw'.

'Not even my family is aware that I've spent a lot of my life battling what I can only describe as a crippling depression.’

He admits in the book that he is ready to speak to his parents about his depression, but this is the first time he has been reported to have sought treatment.

‘Yes, it's serious but there's not a lot I can or want to add,’ broadcaster Alan Jones, a close friend of Ian Thorpe told the Herald Sun.

‘Ian is a beautiful person but he has difficulty recognising his problems.’

After becoming the world's youngest male World Champion in the 1998 Perth World Championships, he dominated the shorter freestyle distances for several years.

He still holds the records of most Olympic gold medals won by an Australian (five) and became the first person to win six golds in one championship in 2001.

He took a break from swimming in 2004, after the Athens Olympics, but failed to make a comeback two years later due to illness and chose instead to retire.

He attempted a comeback ahead of the London 2012 Olympics but only made it to the second day of Australia's Olympic Trials in Adelaide, and instead worked as a pundit for the BBC during the games.

Shortly after London 2012 he moved to Switzerland, but returned to Australia in December last year.
