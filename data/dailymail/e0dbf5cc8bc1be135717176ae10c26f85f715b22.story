A restaurant down the road from Camp David, where Winston Churchill once visited to see how a jukebox worked, auctioned off its collection of memorabilia on Monday.

The Cozy Restaurant, Maryland's oldest family-owned restaurant before it closed in June, was selling historical artifacts and oddities from presidential visitors and high-profile guests to cover hundreds of thousands of dollars in taxes.

The items up for sale included the a bearskin rug, a gift from President Herbert Hoover's secretary that was by the president himself, and the inn's jukebox, NBC reports.

According to 78-year-old owner Jerry Freeze, whose father Wilbur opened the inn in 1929, Churchill visited the restaurant as World War II was being fought.

The British Prime Minister was riding with FDR to the presidential compound and was curious to see what a jukebox looked like. Churchill popped into the restaurant while Roosevelt stayed in the car.

At the time, the restaurant was still a rough place, the scene of wild parties and fights that Wilbur constantly had to break up.

During the Eisenhower administration, the camp's name was changed from Shangri-La to Camp David, after the president's father and grandfather, and members of the family visited to grab a bite.

The presidential compound later took on increased significance, as presidents received foreign dignitaries, which in turn attracted the press.

From Margaret Thatcher visiting Ronald Reagan to President Carter hosting the Camp David accords, White House reporters took a break from Washington to stay at the Cozy Inn.

'We had all the press here,' Freeze said. 'The Walters, the Cronkites, the Brinkleys, the Donaldsons,' Freeze told the Washington Post.

Some of the most frequent visitors during official stays at Camp David, however, were the security details, and the restaurant often served Secret Service agents.

The restaurant was in trouble in recent years, and Freeze says the business owes $180,000 in state and federal taxes, which the auction was meant to partially cover.

'It’s slowly being paid off,' he added. 'After the sale and all, after the smoke clears, everybody should be happy.'

The crowd on Monday was mostly locals, coming to say goodbye as well as get a deal on a bust of George W Bush.

'It's a bit of history going away, and it's kind of sad to see," said Thurmont resident Clive Rowley, who expressed interest in the railroad caboose Freeze had brought into the restaurant.

'Now would be another time to make a transition,' said Freeze about keeping the inn open. 'I'm just getting up there in years a little bit. I'd never thought I'd run out of energy, but I have.'
