Queen of British baking Mary Berry is set to rule the waves on board cruise ship Britannia as P&O launches a series of foodie jaunts around the globe.

Berry leads a list of 10 celebrity chefs  who will give cookery classes at sea on the new liner, along with taking part in Q&A sessions, book signings and host chef’s table dinners. 

The beloved Great British Bake-Off judge will headline the food-related attractions of a 12-night tour around the British Isles, leaving Southampton on July 6 with Theo Randall of the Intercontinental on Park Lane, London, and Saturday Kitchen host James Martin. 

Mary Berry will feature in The Cookery Club on P&O Britannia's British Isles cruise in 2015

The Cookery Club is a bespoke-designed cooking school fitted with KitchenAid appliances 

The facility has 12 stations for a maximum of 24 people and a dining table for participants to taste their work

Seafood specialist Nathan Outlaw, holder of a total four Michelin stars, on a 14-night Portugal, Spain & Morocco cruise, will also feature in the two-hour classes that will cost £100 per person, or £200 per person when hosted by two chefs. 

The specially built Cookery Club, fitted out with KitchenAid appliances, has 12 stations that will accommodate 24 people at a time while bookings will be accepted from four months in advance of each tour's departure.  

Much-loved master of Italian classics Antonio Carluccio, Vivek Singh, famed for his trio of Cinnamon restaurants in London, and French legend Pierre Koffmann, who held three Michelin stars at La Tante Claire and now runs Koffmann’s at The Berkeley in London, will all joint 14-night trips around Spain, Monaco and Italy.
