A pensioner couple branded trespassers in their own home by a High Court judge claim they have been left homeless after they were kicked out by council bailiffs.

Janet and Michael Beech, aged in their 60s, were ejected from their family's home of 47 years in Druids Heath, Birmingham, at 10.30am on Monday morning.

They planned to spend two nights at the nearby Best Western Metro Maypole Hotel, at a cost of £100. There is, they stress, nowhere to go after that.

'We will be homeless': Michael and Janet Beech outside the home in Druids Heath, Birmingham, that they were evicted from on Monday morning. They say temporary accommodation offered by the council is unsuitable

Temporary hostel accommodation offered by the local authority is unsuitable, they insist. But the council maintains it has offered the couple alternative properties of a 'suitable' size.

'This is killing me,' said Mr Beech, 65, as he queued at the council's Northfield housing office hours after the eviction. 'I'm 65 and don't want this. I just want to be left alone.'

Mrs Beech, 62, said: 'We will be homeless, and that makes me angry. We have been shown no kindness.'

The eviction is the heartbreaking final chapter in a long, bitter court battle that, claims Mrs Beech, has cost £200,000 - a £90,000 cost to the council and the rest in the Beechs' legal aid fees.

Heartbreaking: Mr and Mrs Beech embrace each other in the front garden of the council property where they have lived for the past seven years

The average price of a house on their road, Tilshead Close, is just £72,0000.

Mrs Beech's mother and father, Norman and Rita Warren, moved to the three-bedroom council house in 1967.

Mr Warren died of a heart-attack some years ago and seven years ago the Beeches moved in to care for Mrs Warren, a dementia sufferer who passed away in 2010.

When Mrs Warren signed away her tenancy, the couple were left with no legal right to stay at the address.

However, they took court action, claiming a city council housing officer exerted 'undue influence' to encourage Mrs Warren to sign away the tenancy.

The officer was cleared of any wrongdoing by the High Court last year and that decision was upheld at the Court of Appeal.

The judge, Sir Terence Etherton, dubbed the couple trespassers with no right to stay.

Taking a last look at her home, where they left their beloved cat Leo behind, Janet said: 'My dad is turning in his grave. He wouldn't have taken this.

'The council has shown no spirit of kindness. They have admitted we are good tenants. Our gardens have always been beautiful, but not now. We just couldn't face working them.'

The saga has taken its toll on Mrs Beech and her husband, a former welder, who suffers from emphysema. Their only child lives in London.

'It's the stress,' said Mrs Beech. 'I feel sick and just can't sleep. Now I'm beginning to get angry, very angry. Our belongings are being stored in three garages, but my husband's too ill to lift anything.

'Someone has offered to let us rent a property in the same area, but it's not ready yet. It needs refurbishing. The council offered a place at a hostel, but that's no good to us.'

Mr Beech said: 'The bailiff was just doing his job. He wasn't menacing or nasty, but we were broken hearted.

'We need to live close by. Someone's looking after the cat, but we need to go every day to see to him. Leo was completely lost when all the furniture was taken out.'

Sad: Mrs Beech is comforted by a neighbour after she and her husband were kicked out by council bailiffs

The legal row centres on a visit to Mrs Warren by a council housing officer in February, 2010, when she signed a notice to quit her home.

Last year judge Mr Justice Keith granted the council a possession order.

And he threw out claims there should have been a formal assessment of Mrs Warren's mental capacity before she signed.

'I'm very disappointed in the way the judges think,' added Janet. 'It's like they're talking about a number instead of people. The comments are very harsh.'

A spokesman for Birmingham City Council said: 'This case went to court six months ago where the judge found for Birmingham City Council.

'Demand for social housing in Birmingham is extremely high and our challenge is to match properties with the needs of people on our waiting list.

'Mr and Mrs Beech have been offered alternative properties of a suitable size.'
