His head and his both arms were lodged inside.

It appears that after he became trapped his legs gave way and he was choked to death on the lip of the recycling bin's letter box-like opening.

Officers immediately unhooked the man from his position and laid his body out on the ground. But he had already died almost an hour before.

Initial investigations suggest that the man was out shopping and decided to throw some old newspapers away, reports TeleCinco.

A post mortem is due to be carried out today, but sources say it appears the man died from strangulation

Officers think he placed the paper inside the blue container, but accidentally dropped something else inside too.

When he reached in to fetch the item, which has not been identified, they believe he became trapped when the lid flapped shut on his head.

A post mortem is due to be carried out Wednesday, but sources say it appears he died from strangulation, reports Cronica Balear.
