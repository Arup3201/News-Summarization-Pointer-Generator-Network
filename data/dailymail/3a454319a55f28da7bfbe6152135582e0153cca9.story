A professional photographer paddleboarding off Manhattan Beach captured stunning footage of what appears to be a great white shark on Monday.

Photographer Bo Bridges, a resident of the area for 14 years, was paddleboarding with friends when he spotted the juvenile shark about 100 feet from the coastline.

'Once you see it, your knees kind of go weak if you’re on a paddle 
board…the fear hits first, and the excitement kind of gets to you too, 
and then the curiosity as well, so you just start to follow them a 
little bit,' he told KTLA.

Bridges said he'd seen sharks in the water off Manhattan Beach before but had never been able to photograph one

And it's not the first time he's seen sharks in those waters.

'They were here quite often last summer and fall, then they seemed to
 disappear for a bit,' he said. 'And then I heard they were kind of back the other 
day.'

He decided to take the opportunity to get a better look at the great white.

Bridges was paddleboarding with friends when he saw the young shark circling

'I paddled out on Sunday morning, and it was the first thing I saw. 
And then Monday morning…I paddled out…and we ended up running into them 
again, and I was like, ‘I have to go back and get my camera.'

Using an automated drone flying above the water, he managed to capture about 4 minutes of video.

This was the first time Bridges had ever been able to film one of the areas sharks after 14 years living there

In the footage, you can clearly see the shark swimming alongside a pair of paddleboarders.

It was the first time Bridges captured a shark on camera.

'I always wanted to do that,' Bridges said. 'I’ve thought about it, but I didn’t think I’d be able to capture it.'
