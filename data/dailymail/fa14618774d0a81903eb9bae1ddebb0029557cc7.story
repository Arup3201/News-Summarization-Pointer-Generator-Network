The trial of a man who has admitted to the murder and mutilation of his girlfriend and her two young children looks to have been jeopardized by the way police handled his arrest.

Edward Covington, 35, is facing the death penalty for the grisly killings of Lisa Freiberg, 26, and her children, 2-year-old Savannah and 7-year-old Zachary, inside their home in Lutz, a small town in Hillsborough County, Florida.

Covington admitted to murdering the three during a crack cocaine and vodka-induced rage on Mothers Day, 2008, according to Tampa Bay.

He confessed to doctors that he 'ripped' his girlfriend in half.

Covington, who is bipolar, also said that he cut off her son's male organ before killing him.

Defense attorneys for alleged triple-murderer Edward Covington are trying to have the confession he gave police tossed out of court because they refused to let him meet with the attorneys in the days following his 2008 arrest

However what can now be used as evidence at Covington's murder trial - set for October - is up the air because of the way he was treated after being arrested or 'detained'.

Newly released court documents say that defense attorneys were initially barred from seeing Covington.

Covington was hiding in a closet, wearing only black underwear, his body covered in scratches and his feet wet with blood, when police arrived at the murder scene.

He was taken to University Community Hospital (now Florida Hospital) in Tampa, because he told them he had swallowed a lot of pills.

He was where he was listed in the patient registry as 'Allen Doe'.

An ambulance officer who checked him out at the scene described him as 'psychotic'.

The new court documents show that attorneys from the Hillsborough Public Defender's Office had asserted they had the right to visit Covington at the hospital in the days after his arrest, but that the Sheriff's Office refused.

Deceased: Two-year-old Savannah Freiberg was said to have been playing with a toy cell phone when Covington, awaking from a crack cocaine and vodka bender, lashed out at her

After lashing out at her young daughter, Covington is said to have confessed to doctors that he then turned on girlfriend Lisa Freiberg and that he 'ripped her in half'

Covington is also alleged to have cut off the male organ of seven-year-old Zachary Freiberg before killing him

Deputies used a variety of legal pretexts to claim they could keep Covington isolated without legal advice.

They maintained he had not officially been arrested but had been 'detained', despite being handcuffed to a hospital bed, and that the constitutional guarantee of a defense attorney didn't yet apply.

Only after Covington confessed to the crimes - after being moved to an interrogation cell at the Sheriff's Office - did deputies tell him that lawyers from the Public Defender's Office had been trying to see him.

Covington's defense team is now arguing that law enforcement's decision to sequester him from attorneys — going so far as to register him under a false name at a hospital — violated his constitutional rights, and that his confession should be tossed.

'You're entitled to an attorney as soon as you're in custody or under arrest,' Public Defender Julianne Holt said.

'To deny that he was in custody is, I think, very foolish on their part. It flies in the face of common sense.'

Edward Covington has gained a significant amount of weight in jail and is almost unrecognizable to the way he looked at the time of his arrest

Police shut off the street in Lutz where the crimes occurred in May 2008

However authorities say that at the time they didn't know what they were dealing with when handling Covington.

'We had two possible things — either an only witness to a crime or a suspect to a crime,' retired homicide detective Donald Custer, lead investigator on the case at the time, testified last month.

The suppression of the confession could be a significant blow for prosecutors as they prepare for Covington's trial.

Hillsborough Circuit Judge William Fuente will hear additional testimony and arguments on the matter in March. Afterward, he will make a ruling about whether the confession can be presented to a jury.
