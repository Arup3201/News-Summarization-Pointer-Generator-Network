Turia Pitt continues to inspire people all over the world as she reveals how she took on the Great Wall of China to raise $3000 for charity.

The Australian runner, who once worked in front of the camera and as a mining engineer, joined a group of 22 women who walked almost 95 kilometres in eight days across the colossal landmark.

The 26-year-old who suffered burns to 64 per cent of her body in 2011 after being caught in a ferocious bush fire, participated in the climb in order to raise funds for Interplast, a non-for-profit charity which provides reconstructive surgery to people in developing countries.

In 2012 Turia told a parliamentary enquiry about the horrific injuries she suffered in a bushfire while running a marathon.

Only a short way into the race a wildfire trapped her in a rocky gorge, leaving her with 'nowhere to go'.

'It just got hotter and hotter and hotter and I couldn’t stand it any more so I jumped up and tried to run and that’s when I got burned,' she said.

'I stood there in shock – I didn’t even look. I just knew I had been badly burned.'
