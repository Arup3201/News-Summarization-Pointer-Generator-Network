Harry Potter author J. K. Rowling has spoken movingly about the girl she helped to rescue from an institution in Moldova – and then reunite with her family after a five-year absence.

She said she cried on meeting the teenager, who was returned to live with her mother last year by the international children’s charity Lumos, which was set up by Ms Rowling.

In a Tweet about meeting her for the first time last week, Ms Rowling – founder and president of the charity – wrote: ‘Many tears shed as a 14-year-old called Dumitrita shares her experience of life in an institution... She is now in mainstream education and back with her mother.’

Since leaving the grim confines of the home where where the girl had languished since she was nine, Dumitrita has blossomed into a confident young woman and is now an active promoter of inclusive education for all children.

Ms Rowling is committed to shutting down all orphanages and children’s institutions because she says they do more harm than good. 

She argues that infants who spend longer than six months in them suffer developmental and emotional difficulties throughout their childhood. 

‘Locking children away, often in atrocious conditions, has a Grimm’s fairytale quality about it,’ she told government officials and diplomats from around the world at a conference hosted by Lumos, in Central London, last week.

JK Rowling is calling on UK and US leaders and other aid donors to bring an end to children being placed in institutions. Here she is pictured smiling to abandoned baby Maria Dinescu in Bucharest, Romania, in 2006

‘It is my dream that by the time my life ends, the very concept of taking a child away from its family and locking it away will seem to belong to a cruel, fictional world.

‘There is a wealth of scientific proof that institutions cause measurable and irreparable harm. Institutional children are far less likely to be educated, to be physically or mentally well. The effects on infants are particularly chronic, with many failing to thrive or dying.

‘Having no dedicated career can cause stunting, psychological delays and sometimes trauma. Damage is done very early and it is lasting.’

Disabled children in institutions are 100 times more likely to die there than their able-bodied counterparts. Dumitrita is disabled and has learning difficulties. 

Her family were poor and could not afford the education and care she needed, so they were forced to send her away to a government facility far away from her home.

Deprived of individual parental love, care and attention, she failed to grow and thrive. She is not only incredibly small for a 14-year-old but had not received a proper education.

The children's charity Lumos was founded nearly a decade ago by Ms Rowling. In the past four years it has helped some 12,000 children move out of large institutions and orphanages into family and community care

After working with the authorities to close down the institution she was in, Lumos helped provide new services that would allow the children to return and live with their families.

Dumitrita has now developed her abilities, participating in decision making and public speaking.

She is, says the charity, a true example of how deinstitutionalisation can bring positive changes to children’s lives. Ms Rowling said there is still much to be done to transform the lives of the eight million children in institutions worldwide, including challenging the misconception that orphanages are ‘good’ for children in adversity.

She said that when these children return to the world, ‘their chances of a happy life are greatly impaired’ and they are often ‘unable to find employment... and are more likely to enter a lifetime of poverty and dependency’.

‘Supporting children to stay with their own families in their communities was, in nearly all cases, significantly cheaper for societies than funding institutions,’ she told the conference, saying that every youngster had a legal and moral right to a family life, arguing that no institution can ever provide the love children need to reach their potential.

Lumos is the charitable extension of the Harry Potter franchise that made Ms Rowling’s fortune and is a nod to the spell used to generate light at the end of the young wizard’s wand.

It was founded nearly a decade ago after Ms Rowling saw a harrowing picture in a newspaper of a caged child and an article about disabled children in the Czech Republic being restrained in beds.

The next day she started the process that led to her setting up Lumos, which works in countries such as the Czech Republic, Bulgaria, Moldova and Ukraine.

Ms Rowling funds the running costs, meaning all donations are spent on the charity’s work – with its stated aim of ending the practice of institutionalising children in orphanages worldwide by 2050.

Ms Rowling is also helping to launch Lumos’s online social media campaign, #LetstalkLumos, aimed at raising awareness of the plight of children who are living in orphanages and institutions.

The campaign will raise funds for an education unit in a mainstream school in Moldova to demonstrate that children with complex disabilities can be educated alongside their peers without disabilities.

Since the start of last year, Lumos claims to have saved the lives of 646 children suffering from malnutrition and neglect, and to have trained thousands of social workers, health professionals, teachers and policy-makers. 

In the past four years, it has helped 12,000 children move out of large institutions and orphanages into family and community care.
