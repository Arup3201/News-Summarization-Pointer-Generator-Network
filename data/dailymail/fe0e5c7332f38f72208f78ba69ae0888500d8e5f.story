Texas groceries had likely removed by Sunday morning all of the nearly 91,000 pounds of ground beef from store shelves that were subject to a recall due to possible contamination from tiny pieces of metal, an executive at Sam Kane Beef Processors said.

Sam Kane Beef Processors, based in Corpus Christi, Texas, recalled the beef shipped between Sept. 9 and Sept. 18 to Texas retail outlets, the U.S. Department of Agriculture said in a news release on Saturday.

Consumers in four separate incidents reported finding pieces of metal about 3 mm in size in beef products, and one of them reported getting a chipped tooth, the USDA said.

The USDA classified the health risk from the metals as low.

The stores began removing the meat from shelves immediately and it is likely none remained on Sunday, said Herb Meischen, senior vice president of sales and marketing for Sam Kane.

'It was not a food safety issue,' general manager Alfred Bausch told CNN. 'It was a foreign object and the foreign object was very small.'

'The products [...] bear the establishment number '337' inside the USDA Mark of Inspection,' the agency said in the release.  

The products subject to recall were 3-pound packages of HEB ground chuck, 5 and 10-pound packages of HEB ground beef and 10-pound formed patties made from Sam Kane Beef Processors ground chuck, according to the USDA.

In a statement to Local 2, HEB said 'HEB works hard to ensure the integrity and safety of all products we offer in our stores, and hold our suppliers to the highest standards in the industry. The recall has been issued by Sam Kane Beef Processors, LLC in an abundance of caution.

'Customers who purchased the affected product can return the product to the store for a full refund.

The statement said customers are able to call the company's customer relations department.
