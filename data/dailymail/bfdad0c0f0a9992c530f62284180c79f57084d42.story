It's only three months since she welcomed first daughter Nelly with fiancé Greg Shepherd, but Billie Faiers has snapped back into her pre-pregnancy shape - and is definitely already thinking about baby number two. 

Speaking to MailOnline about getting back into shape after giving birth, the 24-year-old said: 'I still have some baby weight to lose but I'm very relaxed about it - I am wearing a lot of looser tops and then tight trousers so am dressing around it.

Back in shape: Billie Faiers, who found fame on The Only Way Is Essex, gave birth in July but is already showcasing a toned physique and has hinted that she's thinking about baby number two

'My priority is Nelly and I want to feel healthy not hungry so I'm not on any diet. The other day I ordered toast and macaroni cheese with bacon! 

'I do find myself running around all the time and particularly with a young baby so I didn't feel too guilty.'

The TOWIE star, who will be returning to our screens tomorrow night, is loving motherhood so much that she's used her expertise to design a pushchair range. 

'The Signature Range’ by Billie Faiers in conjunction with the team at My Babiie will include a set of three exclusive pushchairs, costing £79.99 and £100, which will launch in Mothercare on October 20.

Expert skills: Billie has designed a range of three pushchairs for My Babiie and says they are practical and stylish but very affordable (left, £100, right, £79.99) 

Style sisters: Being a new mother has meant Billie, pictured with co-star sister Sam, was very keen to ensure high focus on product standards as well as the aesthetics. She promises that the designs are simple but bold, stylish, luxurious, accessible and 'effortlessly cool'

Billie explains that she has worked hard with the team at My Babiie to create the products that reflect her personality and her passion for cutting-edge design.

'When I was shopping for Nelly's arrival I couldn't believe how expensive everything was,' she said.

'At first I thought the most expensive items were the best but I soon realised this wasn't the case and the best bits I got for her were actually the most affordable items.'

Billie, who says she really wants to have another baby soon so her children are close in age, added: 'I wanted to create a range that I would use and that would be cost effective for other mums and also would stand the test of time as you don't want to be buying pushchairs with every new arrival - I'm keeping hold of mine and hope to be able to use them again very soon.'

The Minnie's Boutique owner is clearly maternal. When asked her favourite and least favourite parts of motherhood, she said: 'I'm loving every minute.'

Learning as she goes: Billie says that when she first started shopping for Nelly, she thought the most expensive items were the best but soon realised this wasn't the case 

Loving it: Billie says there are no negatives to motherhood and she's 'loving every minute'
