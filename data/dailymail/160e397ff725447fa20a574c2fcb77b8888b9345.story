Eight Transportation Security Administration screeners were fired after they were captured by surveillance cameras sleeping on the job, or violating other standards.

The former employees, who all worked at the Newark Liberty International Airport, were caught napping in a baggage room

This is the latest round of firings in the trouble-ridden TSA, only weeks after seven workers in Philadelphia were fired for bribery.

The shipping news: The former employees, who all worked at the Newark Liberty International Airport in New Jersey, were caught napping in a baggage room

Some of the eight workers were caught on videotape in December, napping in a checked-baggage room in the airport’s Terminal B, TSA said.

The TSA would not say how many of the firings were for sleeping on duty.

To add insult to injury, the TSA is also investigating photographs of government supervisors apparently sleeping in front of bomb-detecting monitors.

Two of the supervisors say they were not working at the time the photos were taken, according to New Jersey’s Star-Ledger. 

TSA spokeswoman Lisa Farbstein said in a statement to MailOnline: ‘TSA holds all of its employees to the highest professional and ethical standards and has a zero tolerance for misconduct in the workplace.

‘Accountability is an important aspect of our work and TSA takes prompt and appropriate action with any employee who does not follow our procedures and engages in misconduct.

‘The decision to take disciplinary action, including the proposed immediate removal of eight individuals from the TSA reaffirms our strong commitment to ensure the safety of the traveling public and to hold all our employees to the highest standards of conduct and accountability,’ the statement read.

An organiser with the Association of Federal Government Employees Union said that they would appeal all eight of the TSA’s terminations.

By request of Sen. Frank Lautenberg (D-New Jersey), the Office of the Inspector General in the Department of Homeland Security is looking into the TSA of Newark, following several security breaches at the airport.

Sen. Lautenberg called the investigation ‘a tough but necessary corrective action to fix a disturbing pattern of misconduct.’

But workers told the Star-Ledger that these investigations have passed over upper management, all while pitting lower-ranking workers against one another.
