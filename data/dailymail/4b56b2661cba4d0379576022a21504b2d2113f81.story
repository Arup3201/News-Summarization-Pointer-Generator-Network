A country mansion with a novel history is up for sale 70 years after it inspired acclaimed British writer Daphne du Maurier.

The six-bedroom romantic Georgian manor house was made famous by du Maurier's semi-historical novel Hungry Hill, which was published in 1943.

The property in Carmarthenshire, South Wales, which is in need of renovation and stands at the end of a private drive in a 34-acre plot of land, has a guide price of  £695,000.

Inspiration: The Grade II-listed manor house in South Wales inspired Daphne du Maurier's novel Hungry Hill

For sale: The Georgian mansion sits within a 34-acre plot of land and has a guide price of £695,000

Historic: The property, which has been in the same family since the 1820s, is in need of restoration

The novel is an account of feuding families through the generations and details how its Puxley family owners - renamed Brodrick in the book - lived in the mansion at Llantharog.

The family business was mined copper in Cork, Ireland, and they needed a place in Carmarthenshire in order to be in easy reach of Swansea Bay, where the metal was unloaded from ships crossing the Irish Sea.

The book covers a century from 1820 to 1920 and was made into a film in 1947. It was du Maurier's 10th work of fiction.

The lengthy book was a best seller in its day but has become a of forgotten title du Maurier, who is best known for her 1938 novel Rebecca.

Du Maurier was born in London in 1907
 and died in Cornwall in 1989 at the age of 81. She was made a Dame in 
1969 but never used the title.

Dan Rees, a property agent with Savills,
 said: 'The house is a gentlemen's residence that still retains aspects 
of the charm conjured up by Du Maurier in her magnificent story of life 
in the late Victorian era.'

Novelist: Dame Daphne du Maurier, pictured in 1988 with her west highland terriers, died in 1989

Family home: The property's owners hope to sell it to a Welsh family who will 'enjoy it' like they did

Acclaimed: Hungry Hill was the 10th work of fiction by du Maurier and was made into a film in 1947

Owner Charles Puxley, whose ancestors bought the estate originally in the 1820s, said it is instantly recognisable in Du Maurier's book.

He said: 'It was once part an estate of 200 acres and is steeped in my family's history. There are many references to it and it is immediately recognisable in Hungry Hill.

Lengthy: There have been 33 editions of Hungry Hill

'The names were all changed but the house, referred to as Llatharog, was vividly described and the driveway, which sees carriages thundering down it is just as in the book.'

Mr Puxley, whose family occupied the property until the 1930s when it was rented out, said it was a truly enchanting place.

But Mr Puxley, who is based in London, said while the sale of the property came with some regret, it should be handed over to another family to enjoy.

He said: 'The property is in need of restoration and while we could invest in doing that, it would only be to let it out again and we didn't feel that would be the best return for us.

'In many ways we feel it would be better to be in the ownership of a Welsh family who could own it and enjoy it the way my family have for the last 200 years.

'I'd much rather that than see it let by me, living 150 miles away.'

The house lies around one mile from the village of Llanddarog and eight miles east of Carmarthen.

Mr Rees said it was rare that a Grade II-listed building with such appeal comes on the market

He said: 'It certainly is a magical place sitting privately in its 34 acres and because of its link to Daphne du Maurier.

'When I first saw the house last autumn I was immediately impressed by it and the link to du Maurier was an amazing coincidence as my wife was reading one of her other novels, Frenchman's Creek, at the time.'

Steeped in history: The house, once part of a 200 acre estate, is 'immediately recognisable' in Hungry Hill

Regret: The Puxley family are sad to be saying goodbye to the property after nearly 200 years
