If you thought the running shoes with toes were strange, wait until you see what the man behind the wacky design has come up with now: the hoof.

Instead of each toe nestling in its own cosy compartment like the fingers of a glove, the new range of running shoes from TopPo Athletic goes minimal, creating only one separate space for the big toe and relegating the remaining four digits to a shared compartment.

The design is based on the Japanese tabi, a soft shoe that is more like a sturdy sock.

The new split-toe shoes are being launched this week at a trade fair in Salt Lake City, Utah, and will go on sale later this year

A more robust version, the tabi shoe, is
 made of heavy material, often with rubber soles that give the wearer a 
tactile contact with the ground.

The separated toe means the wearer can make more agile use of their feet.

The shoes are often used by workmen including rickshaw-pullers and construction workers.

The concept isn't new: Nike released a split-toe running shoe back in the 1990s, the Air Rift.

And even before that, back in 1951, Japanese runner Shigeki Tanaka won the Boston marathon wearing a pair of canvas split-toe tabi socks.

However, Tony Post, an athlete himself and the former head of Vibram, the company that gave the world the Vibram running shoes, has now set up Topa Athletic to market the split-toe running shoe to the masses.

The unloved finger running shoes from Vibram were among the 'terrible things that should end in 2013', according to a gossip website

The new shoe is a fusion of human biomechanics and modern technology: the laces on the lightweight RT model will be made of thin steel fibres with a nylon coating, and will close by turning a dial on the outer side of the shoe.

The design is an important anchor point for the foot, Post told Runner's World Newswire.

'In a shoe with a roomy forefoot, you lack security, especially going downhill,' he said.

Barefoot running came to the world's attention when Olympic runners Zola Budd and Abebe Bikila took part in races barefoot.

The human foot is of course designed to be walked - and run - on. It is very efficient at absorbing the shock of landing and turning the energy of the fall into forward motion.

The foot of a runner who usually wears shoes lands with an initial heel strike, while the foot of a barefoot runner lands with a more springy step on the middle, or on the ball of the foot.

Running in shoes also appears to increase the risk of ankle sprains and other chronic injuries.

The running shoe itself has also been implicated in causing injuries.

One 1991 study found that wearers of expensive running shoes with special features such as added cushioning or pronation correction, could actually be worse for you than cheaper shoes.

But of course running shoes protect the feet from injury and the weather.

The split between the big toe and the other digits mean that the toes can spread naturally while preventing the foot from sliding around inside the shoe.

Post promises that this is 'not another toe shoe'. The aim, he told Wired, is to 'try to work with what nature gave you'.The shoes will 'amplify your natural movements'.

Post is no stranger to controversy. His Vibram FiveFingers shoes - the ones that separate the toes into cosy compartments of their own - sparked scepticism when they debuted.

And just this week, they were included in a list of 'terrible things that must end in 2013'. 'These are revolting,' said gossip website Gawker.

The Vibram shoes were designed to replicate the benefits of running barefoot.

One of the first athletes to stun his opponents by running barefoot was Abebe Bikila of Ethiopia, who won the Rome Olympics marathon in 1960.

Ray Puckett, one of the other competitors, remembers looking at his bare feet and thinking: 'Oh well, that's one we can beat.'

The new split-toe shoes will be launched at a trade show in Salt Lake City, Utah, this week, and are then expected to go on sale later this year.Â
