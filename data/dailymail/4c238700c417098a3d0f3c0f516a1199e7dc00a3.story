Nico Rosberg has intensified his preparations for the Australian Grand Prix, the curtain-raiser of the Formula One season, by taking on an ice challenge in Sweden with Mercedes.

The 29-year-old Rosberg, from Germany, came second to team-mate Lewis Hamilton in the driver standings last season and appears eager to go one better this time around.

The video shows Rosberg gliding through the arctic conditions at the AMG driving academy and even shows off with a power slide.

'Sunday I'm off to Melbourne, so please keep your fingers crossed,' Rosberg says.

After winter testing in Barcelona, where Rosberg set the fastest time of 1 minute, 22.729 seconds, he was in a buoyant mood as he looked ahead to his first race of 2015.

'It has been a great winter for us,' Rosberg said. 'I am not 100 per cent happy yet, but we know what we need to do, so that is important.

'And that is why I am sure we will nail it completely in Melbourne.'
