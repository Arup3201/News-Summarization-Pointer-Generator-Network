Geared up: NHS paramedics are being issued with bullet-proof jackets like this one in case they have to respond with a Mumbai-style attack in Britain

Paramedics will be issued with bullet-proof jackets and trained to respond to a Mumbai-style terror attack, it emerged today.

NHS volunteers are being trained to deal with the aftermath of a 'marauding terrorist gun attack' like the one which left 164 dead in the Indian city in 2008.

Most will be trained to treat battlefield casualties over the next four years.

However, body armour and initial guidance has already been given to small teams of ambulance and fire crews in key areas.

The policy was mooted in a Home Office paper in the summer and confirmed for the first time by the Department of Health this weekend.

'The government has to prepare for the worst and we also need to be certain that lessons are learnt from previous terrorist attacks at home and abroad,' the department told The Sunday Times.

'Where specialist ambulance crews may be asked to respond to incidents involving firearms, it is necessary that they receive proper training and are provided with appropriate personal protective equipment.'

The move, which according to one military source was designed to replicate protection given to the army, was applauded by former terrorism czar Lord Carlile as a 'very sensible precaution'.

Worst-case scenario: A victim of a gun attack lies on a hospital bed at the St George's hospital in Mumbai, India, in November 2008. Indian medics had to treat the dying and injured in perilous conditions

Disaster zone: A policeman stands guard after shootings at a railway station in Mumbai. The response to the atrocities was far more like going into battle

It harks back to the days of the Troubles in Northern Ireland when bullet-proof jackets were used by ambulance staff at the height of the conflict.

However, this is the first time the equipment has been given to medics on the mainland.

The atrocities, which had been planned for a long time in advance, involved 10 co-ordinated bombing and shooting assaults by Islamists on hotels and restaurants in the country's largest city.

Scotland Yard has been warning hotels, restaurants and financial companies about the possibility of copycat attacks in Britain.

On the front line: Paramedics are afforded a reasonable amount of protection when dealing with dangerous incidents, but the government believes this should go a step further amid terror threats to Britain
