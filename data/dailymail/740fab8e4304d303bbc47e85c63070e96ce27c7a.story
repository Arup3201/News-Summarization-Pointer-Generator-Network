Three Roma gipsy couples have been arrested in France and accused of exporting a vast network of child thieves to countries including Britain.

The centre of their Oliver Twist-style operation was Paris, where girls as young as 12 were taught how to steal, and often attacked if they did not bring in enough cash.

They were threatened with beatings, cigarette burns to the face and even rape if they failed to steal at least £250 every day.

Paris prosecutors believe that those taken into custody oversaw hundreds of robberies involving juveniles since 2010.

All six have been charged with people-trafficking, forcing minors to commit crimes, money laundering and criminal conspiracy.

Two of the accused – named only as Stejar B, 43, and Lucica T, 44 – are even said to have exploited their own four children as part of the racket.

All were based in an illegal camp in La Courneuve, in the northern suburbs of Paris, but were in touch with Roma groups throughout Europe.

The children were sent to neighbouring countries including Britain. It is not yet clear how many of the child thieves and pick-pockets may have been operating in cities such as London.

A police source said: ‘They trained young woman how to go out on to the streets to make money illegally.

‘Scams included pretending to be deaf and dumb and asking for cash, and tricking people at cashpoint machines. Straightforward pick-pocketing was also a key.

‘These tricks could be used in any major cities or towns – hence some of the girls being trafficked abroad.’Such pick-pocketing networks are becoming increasingly common as Roma communities travel across Europe.

Children arrested by the police can seldom be prosecuted, and are instead let off with a caution at most, leaving them free to carry on with their crimes.

Romanian police officers are working with the French to try to control the growing problem.

Najat Vallaud-Belkacem, the minister for women’s rights in France, will next month unveil ‘a new plan to combat human trafficking and delinquency’.

In September, Manuel Valls, the French Interior Minister, caused controversy by saying that most of the estimated 20,000 Roma in France had no intention of integrating into society and should be deported.

The six arrested Roma are expected to face trial in the new year.

In May, a Roma ‘Fagin’ called Fehim Hamidovic was sentenced to seven years in prison for controlling a network of up to 500 youngsters – the biggest ever discovered in Europe.
