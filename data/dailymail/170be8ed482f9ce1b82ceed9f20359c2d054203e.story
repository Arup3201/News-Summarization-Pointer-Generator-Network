Sir Alex Ferguson enjoyed a glittering reign as Manchester United manager, but not all of his signings were successful at Old Trafford.

As £20m winger Nani returns home to Sporting Lisbon after falling out of favour at United, we look back at some of Ferguson's worst signings during his Old Trafford reign. 

Homecoming: Nani was mobbed when arriving in Lisbon as he returns to Sporting on a season-long loan

Massimo Taibi

He cost £4.5m in 1999 and played only the four times. Dubbed the Blind Venetian by the tabloid press, Taibi returned to Italy within six months. His blooper against Southampton, as the ball squirmed under his body, ensures his name will never be forgotten.

Mark Bosnich

Signed from Aston Villa to replace Peter Schmeichel but beset by injury problems and inconsistency. In his book last year, Ferguson described Bosnich as a 'terrible professional'.

'We played down at Wimbledon and Bosnich was tucking into everything: sandwiches, soups, steaks. He was going through the menu. We arrived back in Manchester, and Mark was on mobile phone to a Chinese restaurant to order a takeaway. Is there no end to you? I just couldn't make an impact on him.'

Replaced as United's first-choice keeper by Fabien Barthez.

William Prunier

Looked like Jaap Stam but played nothing like him. Horror show against Spurs in a 4-1 defeat sealed his fate. In his autobiography, Ferfuson recounted a conversation with Patrice Evra.

'William Prunier was another one I was mocked for. Even Patrice Evra, in that high-pitched way, said to me one day: 'Boss, did you have William Prunier?' Ryan Giggs' face dropped as he waited for the response. 'Aye, we had him on trial once,' I snapped. 'On trial?' Evra squeaked back. 'A two-game trial?'

'Yes, and it was a disaster.' Ferguson admitted.

Neil Whitworth

A centre-half signed in the early days by Ferguson in a £45,000 deal from Wigan. Played only once in four years for the club in a 1-1 draw at Southampton in March 1991.

Eric Djemba-Djemba

So bad they named him twice, Djemba-Djemba was signed to add steel to the United midfield but departed after 18 months. He is, however, an FA Cup winner after being part of the United side that lifted the trophy in 2004. Good quiz question, that. What has Djemba-Djemba won that Edwin van der Sar, Wayne Rooney and Rio Ferdinand have not?

Misfit: Eric Djemba-Djemba helped Manchester United win the FA Cup in 2004 but was soon out of the club

Juan Sebastian Veron

The £28.1m signing who was billed as a superstar. Could never quite get to grips with the physicality of the English game and despite some magical moments in the Champions League, he underwhelmed. United did, however, reclaim £15m when he was sold to Chelsea two seasons after his arrival.

Costly: Juan Sebastian Veron never justified the large transfer fee Manchester United payed for him

Kleberson

A Brazilian World Cup winner in 2002, United spent £6m to bring Kleberson to Old Trafford from Atletico Paranaense one year later, seeing off competition from Leeds United. Ferguson said at the time: 'One of the reasons we sold Veron was because we knew we were getting Kleberson - that shows how highly we regard his talent.' 

He was the first Brazilian to sign for United. Now we'll get onto the second one...

Big stage: Kleberson won the World Cup with Brazil in 2002 before moving to Old Trafford

Anderson

Signed from Porto in a deal worth in excess of £19m, Anderson had previously been tracked by Chelsea and Real Madrid. His first season was a success as United won the Champions League in 2008 but he failed to kick on, suffering injury problems and a visible lack of fitness.

He was voted best player at the Under 17 World Championships in 2005 but is now surplus to requirements at Manchester United and will be sold if United can find a buyer.

Liam Miller

Signed on a free transfer from Celtic in 2004. In Ireland, they referred to him as 'the future of Irish football' or the 'next Roy Keane.' Scored only twice - in League Cup ties against Barnet and Crewe - and ended up at Sunderland under Keane, where he fared better but was eventually transfer-listed. 

Keane said: 'If you are driving to work don't get in the car with Liam Miller because he has more car crashes than anyone I know. It's nothing to do with him as a player or as a lad. If he is late once or twice, even three or four times, maybe well and good, but when it is five, six or seven times then you have to draw the line.'

High hopes: Liam Miller was described as 'the future of Irish football' and the 'next Roy Keane'

Bebe

The most bizarre of Ferguson's signings, brought in to the club on the recommendation of Carlos Quieroz despite the manager never having watched him either live or on television. The £7m winger did not start a Premier League game in his four-year spell with the club, exiting this summer to Benfica.

Blind faith: Ferguson never watched Bebe play but still spent £7m to bring him to Manchester United

Ralph Milne

At an LMA dinner in 2009, Ferguson admitted Milne, who scored only three goals in his first season at the club, was his worst signing: 'I only paid £170,000 but I still get condemned for it.' 

The forward exited United in 1991 and joined Sing Tao, the now defunct Hong Kong club.

David Bellion

A £1.5m gamble from Sunderland in 2003. Had raw pace and a decent finisher but some way short of the required quality. Scored eight goals in two seasons before being moved on.

Dry: David Bellion scored eight goals in two seasons at Old Trafford before being sold

Dong Fangzhou

The first Chinese player to play for United arrived in 2004 but could not play until 2006 due to work permit issues. Appeared once in the League Cup in a 2-0 defeat at home by Coventry and also came on a substitute in one game in the Champions League. His contract was terminated in 2008. He did not score any goals but he may well have sold some shirts. Now starring for Hebei Zhongji.

Absence: Dong Fangzhou didn't feature for United for his first two years due to work permit problems

Wilfried Zaha

Fergie's final signing has endured a miserable time at Old Trafford and is still to start a Premier League game. David Moyes felt that Zaha's work on the training ground was short of the required standard and he was loaned to Cardiff in January, where he struggled once more.

He was part of the group that toured the USA but was not in the United squad that faced Swansea last weekend and could leave the club in the next fortnight.

Underwhelming: Wilfried Zaha arrived from Crystal Palace with a big reputation but hasn't broke through

Diego Forlan

The Uruguayan forward signed from Independiente in 2002 but took 27 matches to score his first goal. He went on to score 17 in 95 appearances and is most famously remembered for scoring twice in a victory at Liverpool. 'He came from Uruguay, and made the Scousers cry,' went the ditty. Since leaving, he proved himself as a brilliant goalscorer with Villarreal and Atletico Madrid.

Wait: Diego Forlan took 27 matches to score his first goal for Manchester United
