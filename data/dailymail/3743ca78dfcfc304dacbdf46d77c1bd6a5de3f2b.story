England football captain Kelly Smith says she would have 'slapped' the on-court interviewer who asked Eugenie Bouchard to twirl after her win in the Australian Open last week.

Serena Williams and Canada's Bouchard were asked to spin around to show off their outfits during on-court interviews in Melbourne, prompting an angry response on social media and accusations of sexism levelled at Tennis Australia commentator Ian Cohen, who made the request.

Smith described the request as 'arrogance or stupidity' and told Sportsmail: 'If I was (asked by an interviewer to twirl) I would probably have slapped him around the face or something. It was an insult to women's sport.'

Smith was speaking at the launch of the Women's Sport Trust's £BeaGamechanger Awards, which recognise the individuals and organisations doing the most to progress women's sport - and consign such outdated requests to the past.

Smith added: 'It shows that there still is that ignorance when it comes to women's sport and that transfers to kids today - people think it is still okay to say things like that.

'The more we raise the profile of women's sport through the Women's Sport Trust and awards such as these, the bigger the chance of knocking that behaviour and ignorance out of sport and society in general.' 

Bouchard did oblige, later commenting that it was 'unexpected' that an 'old guy' asked her to twirl on-court

The 38-year-old Smith will lead England to the World Cup in Canada in June admitting the rising profile of the women's game will heap the squad with the extra pressure of expectation.

But she is relishing the belated interest after recalling a different story even as recently as the last World Cup in 2011 when England exited on penalties at the quarter-final stage.

Smith said: 'The women's game is reaching new levels in this country and being a role model is now part of the package - I never had a female sporting role model growing up so I am happy to help.

'There is money and television coming into the game now on a level we did not have four years ago. The general public have been involved in the build-up and all it needs now is for the team to perform and the sport will explode again.'

Smith has the biggest ambitions for the England squad in Canada and believes that having soared unbeaten through their qualification they are justified in believing they are capable of competing with the traditional powerhouses of the women's game.

'We have seen a real shift in the players' mentality over the last few years - you have to have that belief both individually and collectively that you can go out and do it,' added Smith.

'It is something we have probably lacked in the past but we have got it now and with the attitude we have instilled in the team we know we are capable of taking on and beating anyone in the world.'

Billie Jean King, who won the tournament in 1968, had previously accused Cohen of being 'truly sexists' and tweeted: 'The Australian Open interviewer asking the women to 'twirl' on court is out of line.

'This is truly sexist. If you ask the women, you have to ask the guys to twirl as well.'

The 12-time Grand Slam singles winner, now 71, added: 'Let's focus on competition and accomplishments of both genders and not our looks.'

Bouchard looked slightly bemused by the request, which followed her straight-sets win over Kiki Bertens, admitting in her post-match press conference the question had taken her by surprise.

'It was very unexpected. I mean, yeah, I don't know. An old guy asking you to twirl, it was funny,' said the seventh seed. 

Serena Williams refused to discuss suggestions of sexism, but suggested that male players wouldn't have been asked the same question by the interviewer
