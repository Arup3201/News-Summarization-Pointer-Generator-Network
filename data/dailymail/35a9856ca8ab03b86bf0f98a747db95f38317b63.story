Landmark ruling: Ronald Huzar, 58, has been awarded compensation from Jet2.com after a three-year legal battle

Millions of holidaymakers hit by long delays due to technical faults with planes will be entitled to claim compensation following a landmark court ruling.

Airlines can currently avoid paying out if the jet has a mechanical or electrical problem by arguing it amounts to ‘extraordinary circumstances’ beyond their control.

But the Court of Appeal has ruled this is not a proper defence, opening the floodgates to compensation claims dating back six years.

Consumer groups hailed the decision as a major victory for travellers. It came after Ronald Huzar demanded compensation for a 27-hour delay that he and his family suffered on the way home from a holiday in Malaga in October 2011.

The airline Jet2.com said it did not have to pay because an unforeseeable technical problem had grounded the flight. But the court yesterday ruled in favour of Mr Huzar.

Richard Lloyd, executive director of consumer group Which?, said: ‘This ruling shows that airlines cannot avoid ducking their responsibilities by claiming that routine technical problems are extraordinary circumstances.

‘Airlines must be transparent about the causes of delay and ensure that consumers have sufficient information to exercise their rights.’

Mr Huzar had argued he was entitled to compensation under European Union regulations after suffering ‘no little inconvenience’ when the flight to Manchester left a day late.

Under the current compensation regime, which applies across the EU, travellers can make a claim if a flight has been delayed for at least three hours and the airline has no legitimate excuse.

Just how much they can claim depends on the length of the journey, rising from 250 euros (£201) per person on short haul flights to a maximum of 600 euros (£483).

To avoid paying out, Jet2.com bosses claimed the problem which caused the delay – a technical fault on a Boeing airliner – amounted to an ‘extraordinary circumstance’.

Jet2.com claimed a technical glitch delaying his flight by 27 hours was an 'extraordinary circumstance' and therefore they should not pay

Lawyers say the case could open the floodgates for compensation claims worth ‘billions of pounds.’

They say Mr Huzar’s case clarifies when a technical defect can be considered an ‘extraordinary circumstance’ and thus used as a valid defence by the airline to not pay flight delay compensation.

Article 5 (3) of EU Regulation EC 261/2004, which came into effect on the 18th of February 2005, establishes common rules on compensation and assistance to passengers in the event that your flight is delayed, that you are denied boarding, or your flight is cancelled.

Statistics from the Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) show 19.6 million passengers from the past six years could be eligible to make a claim, Bott and Co said.

Around 90 per cent of these claims are due to technical defects, the spokesman added.

The compensation rules apply to any flight departing from an EU Airport or flying into the EU with an EU carrier.

The rules provide passengers with certain guarantees – refreshments, phone calls, overnight accommodation and, if appropriate, damages.

Airlines must provide refreshments, phone calls, overnight accommodation irrespective.

Their one defence to compensation claims is an ‘extraordinary circumstances’ defence.

This includes ‘unforseeable’ events such as poor meteorlogical conditions, political instability, security risks, industrial action, and unforeseen flight safety shortcomings.

But the defendant – in the this case the airline – must prove their case.

But the court said this defence did not apply in Mr Huzar’s case because such technical faults do not count as events beyond the airline’s control – unlike terrorism, strikes, air traffic control problems and freak weather.

It dismissed the airline’s appeal against an earlier ruling at Stockport County Court.

The ruling means a family of four taking a summer holiday to popular hot spots around the Mediterranean could be entitled to around £800 compensation if delayed for more than three hours by a technical fault.

Speaking after the judgment, Mr Huzar 
said: ‘I am absolutely delighted with the decision. After everything I 
have been through to get to this point it’s a  fantastic day.

‘I always hoped that we would get a positive outcome and it’s nice to get to this milestone.’

He added: ‘The result in my favour should help passengers throughout the country who have experienced similar  difficulties to me.’

His solicitor David Bott said: ‘The judgment states that technical problems, such as with the wiring on Mr Huzar’s flight, may be unforeseeable, but are ultimately caused by an event inherent in the running of an aircraft, and cannot therefore be considered to be an extraordinary circumstance.’

The three appeal judges in London said the onus of proof was on the airline to show that extraordinary circumstances existed and that delay could not have been avoided.

The delay at the heart of the legal wrangle was caused by a wiring fault in  Jet2.com’s  Boeing 737-33A aircraft.

All parties accepted that it was ‘unforeseen and unforeseeable’.

But one of the judges, Lord Justice Elias, said that this should not be a reason to deny compensation as ‘it would be anticipated that unforeseeable problems will in general occur from time to time’.

He said: ‘Whilst it would no doubt be accurate to say that the particular defect in the particular flight was not expected, since defects of that nature do arise from time to time, that is not in my view the same as saying that the particular problem was unexpected.’

He said that simply by using this defence airlines would ‘discourage inconvenienced passengers from pursuing their claims’.

Lord Justice Elias added: ‘Mr Ronald Huzar suffered no little inconvenience when his flight from Malaga to Manchester was delayed.

'The appeal raises a point of some importance to the airline passenger industry.’

Open the floodgates: Mr Huzar's lawyers, Bott and Co, claim more than 19 million passengers from the last six years are now eligible to table a case for compensation (delayed passengers pictured at Heathrow last year)
