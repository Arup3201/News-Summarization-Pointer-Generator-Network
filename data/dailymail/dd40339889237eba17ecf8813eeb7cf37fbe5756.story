A giant human-made landform in the heart of Northumberland has scooped a global lanscape award, beating off competition from Mexico and Malaysia.

Northumberlandia, dubbed the 'Lady of the North', is the world's largest landsculptre and is embedded into the hills of Cramlington in the North East.

The public park is built in the shape of a reclining lady lying on the hillside.

Impressive: The landscape is the largest human made landform in the world and is made of contoured hills and valleys

Work of art: The formation is cut into the earth and rises out in the shape of a woman, here climbers can bee seen on the face of the figure

It cost £3million to build and was 
sculpted by architects who used raw materials from a nearby mine to make
 the contours of the woman's body rise up from the earth.

Finished in 2012, the site, which is managed by independent charity The Land Trust, has already been visited by more than 100,000 people.

The construction came about as part of the development of an adjacent open-cast coal mine at Shotton.

It
 was decided that rather than returning the material excavated back to 
the surface near the mine, something creative should be done with the 
soil and clay.

The hills have eyes: From the perspective of the face of the valley, walkers look down to sweeping curves of the structure

Swirling beauty: The formation, which cost around £3m to create, was funded by local energy firm The Banks Group

Built by
 regional property and energy firm the Banks Group and the Blagdon 
Estate, the site has now been awarded with the Best Landscape 
Architecture category in the 2013 International Property Awards

Katie
 Perkin, communications manager at The Banks Group, said: 'Winning this 
global award provides a wonderful finale to a fantastic first full year 
for Northumberlandia. The quality of the landform's design and 
construction, and the cultural, community and tourism impact that she's 
having have been widely recognised by both a range of awards and the 
tens of thousands of people who've already been to visit her.

'The
 projects against which Northumberlandia was competing for this award 
represent the very best in landscape architecture around the world, so 
this award is a real coup for both everyone involved with the project 
and North East England as a whole.

Locally sourced: The destination took two and a half years to construct using 1.5 million tonnes of stone, clay and soil from Banks' adjacent Shotton Surface Mine

'Being
 in this sort of spotlight provides a great platform for the region, as 
well as for Northumberlandia herself, and we hope it will lead to even 
more visitors coming to the North East to take a look at everything 
that's on offer here.'

Bob 
Downer, chief executive of Blagdon Estate, added: 'Everyone involved in 
Northumberlandia is delighted to receive this international award to add
 to the regional and national prizes already awarded.

'Blagdon
 Estate is privileged to be part of this project which is now gaining 
recognition as a unique landscape and arts project as well as a gateway 
to the rest of Northumberland, while enhancing the leisure facilities 
available to the local community.'

Face of nature: Last year, more than 100,000 people visited the site to roam the man-made hills

Vast: The public park, dubbed the 'Lady of the North' is 34 metres 112 feet high and 400 metres long
