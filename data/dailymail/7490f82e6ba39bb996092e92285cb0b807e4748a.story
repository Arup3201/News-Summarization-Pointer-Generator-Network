Protest: Pay for teachers and other public sector employees are capped at one per cent

The average salary of a public  sector worker has fallen for the first time since records began, official  figures revealed yesterday.

The Office for National Statistics said that average weekly earnings in the  public sector dropped by 0.5 per cent in August, the first monthly drop since 2001, when figures began being taken.

The news represents a watershed moment for Britain, which saw the size of the State workforce and their average salaries balloon during 13 years of a Labour government.

This is the first drop in public sector salaries since 2001, but the ONS has recorded eight drops in salaries for private sector workers over the same period, although they actually rose by 1.1 per cent in August.

However, State workers, who account for nearly one in five workers in Britain, are still being better paid than their counterparts in the private sector.

On average, a State worker earns £484 a week, while a private sector worker earns £473 per week.

These figures include any bonuses paid on top of salaries, although many workers receive nothing.

Since the coalition Government came to power in May 2010, it has cracked down on public sector wage rises and staffing levels.

It began with a two-year pay freeze for  anyone earning a salary of £21,000 or more, followed by a two-year cap on pay rises at an average of one per cent a year.

Since June 2010, the number of public  sector jobs has been cut by nearly 650,000. In contrast, between 1999 – when the ONS started keeping such records – and June 2010, the sector grew by just over 850,000 workers.

Unions are dismissive of the idea of a public sector pay premium, pointing out that many public  sector workers are well-educated and highly qualified.

The State sector also includes many highly skilled and specialised jobs which do not exist in the  private sector, such as judges, army generals, university lecturers and senior civil servants.

The figures for the last few years do not entirely reflect the public sector pay freezes because of changes in staffing levels. For example, overall average pay may appear higher if the public sector is losing junior members of staff in the jobs cull, but holding on to senior, better-paid staff.

The ONS figures are also complicated by other factors, such as some jobs being ‘reclassified’ from the private into the public sector.

Cuts: Almost 650,000 public sector jobs have been cut since the Coalition government took power

For example, the banks rescued by the taxpayer in the financial crash, such as Royal Bank of Scotland, have been moved into the public sector, while sixth-form and further education colleges in England have been transferred into the private sector because they are run as corporations.

However, whether workers are in the public or the private sector, the ONS’s figures continued to highlight what economists described yesterday as a ‘ferocious’ squeeze on salaries.

The cost of living has been rising, with a long list of bills –  from the cost of heating to the weekly family shop – reaching record levels.

The Bank of England’s inflation target, which is set by the Government, is two per cent, but inflation has been above this level for nearly four years.

‘The figures confirm that the ferocious squeeze on real pay levels continues,’ said Nigel Meager, director of the independent Institute for Employment Studies

‘There is huge pent-up pressure for wage increases in the system. As the recovery proceeds, employers may find it harder to resist this pressure.’

The toxic combination of high inflation and low pay rises mean that millions of workers are actually earning less in ‘real’ terms than they were before the recession began in 2008.

‘Real’ means that the figures have been adjusted for inflation. Your salary might be higher but its spending power has been reduced because bills and other items have been rising much faster.

Average weekly earnings for a worker in either the public or  private sector are £447 a week, excluding bonuses, according to the ONS’s figures.

This is the lowest level in real terms since records began in 2001, according to the independent think tank, the Resolution Foundation, based on the higher RPI measure of inflation.

James Plunkett, the foundation’s director of policy, said: ‘This has been a tough downturn for wages.‘The fall in real wages we’ve seen has been unprecedented. But perhaps most worrying today is that there’s still no sign of the wage squeeze ending.

‘Despite some better economic news, the gap between pay and prices is wider now than it was a year ago.’

Dr John Philpott, director of The Jobs Economist, said: ‘This degree of real wage squeeze is not conducive to a strong and sustained recovery in the UK economy.’
