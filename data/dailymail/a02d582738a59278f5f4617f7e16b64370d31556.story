Gone: Dr Gordon Coutts, who is on sick leave, will not return to Colchester Hospital University NHS Trust by 'mutual agreement'

The chief executive of a scandal-hit hospital under investigation over the manipulation of cancer waiting times has resigned.

Dr Gordon Coutts, who is on sick leave, will not return to Colchester Hospital University NHS Foundation Trust by ‘mutual agreement’.

It comes after the Mail revealed he was personally alerted to allegations about the manipulation of data as early as 2011, but failed to act.

Police are investigating claims that staff were ‘pressured or bullied’ by  managers to alter cancer waiting times in order to meet national targets, potentially putting lives at risk.

The £165,000-a-year boss has been accused of having a ‘fixation’ with government targets.

His personal assistant, Mandy Tapfield, quit in October after 28 years at the hospital. Her husband Paul claimed Dr Coutts had bullied her and ‘made her life hell’.

Yesterday a trust spokesman said Dr Coutts would not get any payoff. He would be leaving immediately – rather than serving his six-month notice period – and would not be receiving further salary payments.

But he will now be eligible for a £10,000-a-year pension and a pension lump sum of up to £5,000, despite only serving as chief executive for three years.

Dr Coutts said in a statement: ‘I regret that there have been problems in the trust’s cancer services. As chief executive I always took my responsibility for what happened in the organisation very seriously.

‘I am sorry that some of our patients were let down and that what has happened may have damaged local people’s confidence in their hospitals.’

Cover-up: Police are investigating claims that staff at the hospital were 'pressured or bullied' by managers to alter cancer waiting times in order to meet national targets, potentially putting lives at risk

Last month, the trust was put in 
special measures following a Care Quality Commission report, which found
 ‘inaccuracies’ with waiting times data relating to cancer treatment.

Staff
 told inspectors they were bullied into changing figures to make it 
appear they were being treated within national guidelines.

The
 watchdog said the records of 22 patients had been changed to cover up 
the fact that they had faced ‘extensive’ delays for treatment.

Some
 patients at Colchester General Hospital waited four months for vital 
drugs. National guidelines say patients must wait a maximum of two 
months for their initial cancer treatment from the time they are 
referred to hospital by a GP.

NHS
 England launched an investigation involving the files of as many as 
25,000 cancer sufferers who have undergone treatment at Colchester over 
the past three years. It will publish its report today.

Last
 month, patient John Campbell said he contacted Dr Coutts in 2011 after a
 nurse told him in front of other patients that she had heard records 
were being altered.

But 
rather than act on the information, the chief executive sent an 
astonishing reply saying he would only investigate if the patient had 
evidence of wrongdoing.

Dr Coutts was also criticised for juggling his demanding role at the trust with his own management consultancy business.

Last
 year, he received dividends of £20,000 from Coutts Consulting Ltd, 
which advises the health industry on how to improve performance and 
leadership.

Tim Roberts, of 
the Unison union, said: ‘Dr Coutts should have resigned weeks ago. He 
was the leader of the organisation and was ultimately accountable for 
patient safety.’
