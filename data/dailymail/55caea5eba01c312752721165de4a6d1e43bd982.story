Ravel Morrison has been cleared of threatening to throw acid in the face of his ex-girlfriend and have her killed.

The 21-year-old West Ham United midfielder was said to have harassed Reah Mansoor over a four-year period but on Monday the Crown Prosecution Service formally withdrew the allegation.

Morrison, on loan at Cardiff City, was also accused of threatening to blow up Miss Mansoor's house as part of the alleged conduct between January 2010 and July this year.

A not guilty verdict on Morrison's harassment charge was formally recorded on Monday in a case management hearing at Manchester Crown Court, which the footballer attended.

Morrison will stand trial at the same court on January 26 on three remaining charges of assaulting Miss Mansoor, 19, and her mother, Parveen Mansoor, 39, in the early hours of July 24.

The ex-Manchester United player denied the harassment charge at a preliminary hearing held in August.

He also pleaded not guilty to two counts of assault by beating and one of assault causing actual bodily harm.

Morrison, originally from Manchester, was bailed on condition he lives at an address in Cardiff, does not contact directly or indirectly the two women complainants, and does not enter the Greater Manchester area except for a court appearance or when he plays in his professional capacity.

Despite being touted as a bright prospect at Old Trafford, Morrison appeared only in the League Cup before former Manchester United boss Sir Alex Ferguson sold him to West Ham for £650,000 in January 2012.

West Ham manager Sam Allardyce later shipped him out on loan to Birmingham and QPR.

Morrison, who has four England Under 21 caps, is currently playing for Championship club Cardiff City on a three-month loan deal.
