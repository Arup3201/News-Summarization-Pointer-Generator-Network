Liverpool striker Daniel Sturridge comes from a proper football family.

His uncle Dean was a professional for the likes of Derby County, Leicester and Wolves, and now his younger cousin Dean Jr has been getting on the scoresheet for Aston Villa Under 13s. 

The goal, posted on Instagram by the England striker, shows his young relative timing his run to perfection and slotting the ball past the opposition keeper.

After being put through on goal, Dean Sturridge Jr is left to slot past the opposition goalkeeper with ease

Dean Sturridge (1991-2007):                             Derby, Torquay (loan), Leicester, Wolves, Sheffield United (loan), QPR, Kidderminster 

Daniel Sturridge (2006-present):               Aston Villa (academy), Manchester City, Chelsea, Bolton (loan), Liverpool

Dean Sturridge Junior (2014-present):     Aston Villa (academy) 

It's a move more commonly seen by Daniel on the pitch at Anfield.

Alongside the video, Sturridge remarks: 'Dean Sturridge junior... Another Sturridge coming up!!! My younger cousin plays for Aston villa u13s. God willing I can play with him one day!!'

And if the family's football history is anything to go by, it's certainly not impossible. The Sturridge talent factory could well churn out another star.
