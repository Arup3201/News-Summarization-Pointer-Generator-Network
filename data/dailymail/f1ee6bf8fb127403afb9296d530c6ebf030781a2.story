Shammi Atwal, 45, was pushed under a moving skip lorry as he chased a gang who had tried to rob his cash and carry outlet in Barking

A wealthy businessman was killed when he was pushed into the path of a lorry by a gang of armed robbers.

Shammi Atwal, 45, was shoved into the road as he struggled with up to ten masked raiders armed with sledgehammers and metal bars.

The father-of-two died from  catastrophic injuries just yards from his wife who had locked herself inside their drinks wholesale company.

Scotland Yard launched a murder inquiry as detectives paid tribute to Mr Atwal’s bravery in trying to defend his wife and business.

Speaking at the £750,000 family home in Chigwell, Essex, last night, cousin Surjit Atwal, 50, said they had suffered a ‘huge loss’.

He said Mr Atwal’s wife Deepa, 37, who suffered minor injuries in the raid, has been left ‘devastated’.

‘What we understand has happened is a few people tried to come in and tried to rob the place.

‘He tried to stop them and in the scuffle he was pushed under the lorry,’ he added.

‘His wife is obviously devastated. She was there at the time. She was trying to lock the doors and keep them out so does not know what happened after they left the building.

‘It is a huge shock. You go to work and try to earn some money for your family and you do not expect something like this to happen.’

The robbery took place at Mr Atwal’s company, Glenn & Co, a  supplier to the hospitality industry, in Barking, Essex, on Monday.

Witnesses said the men parked cars nearby before rushing inside.

They saw Mr Atwal pursue the men as they ran out of the store carrying bags before a scuffle took place in the street.

It
 was at this point, police believe, that the businessman was pushed into
 the path of a passing HGV which ran him over, killing him instantly.

The
 company is based on an industrial estate occupied mainly by warehousing
 companies, car garages, delivery firms and other cash and carry 
businesses.

Serdar Gurghur, 
36, a chef at a nearby café, said customers saw at least four men get 
out of a black BMW before pulling on masks and running to the cash and 
carry.

He said: ‘They 
obviously knew where they wanted to go. Then five minutes later they ran
 back past holding bags and sledgehammers.

‘We all knew Mr Atwal well. He would come here often, sometimes with his young daughter.

‘He was a good man, a hard-working man.’

Mr Atwal, who had a daughter, four, and son, seven, had run the drinks firm for almost a decade.

The latest company accounts show it is worth more than £1million.

Surjit Atwal said the family had been working in Britain for ‘many years’ after emigrating from the  Punjab, India.

Paying
 tribute to his cousin, he added: ‘He was a family man. He was 
hard-working and very much loved within the community. It is such a sad 
loss that someone so young was taken away from us like that.’

Mr
 Atwal’s uncle Tarsem Singh, 65, said: ‘He worked very, very hard and 
the rest of the time was spent with his family or at the Sikh temple.’

Detective
 Chief Inspector Neale Baldock, who is leading the murder  inquiry, 
branded the attack an ‘appalling and cowardly crime’.

He said: ‘This was a man trying to stop thieves robbing his business.

‘He
 acted bravely in defence of his wife and managed to chase the  robbers 
from his premises only for him to be pushed in front of a  moving 
lorry.’
