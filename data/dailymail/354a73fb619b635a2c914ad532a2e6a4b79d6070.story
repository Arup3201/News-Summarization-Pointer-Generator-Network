Alan Pardew has questioned Hatem Ben Arfa’s ‘love and passion’ for Newcastle after insisting he hasn’t taken a risk in showing the Frenchman the door.

Under-fire Pardew conceded his decision to loan the fans’ favourite to Premier League rivals Hull City is unpopular after fans set up a website calling for his head.

But he has asked supporters to look at the bigger picture, and is happy to take flak for making difficult choices he is adamant are for the club’s long-term benefit.

Hatem Ben Arfa's departure has upset many Newcastle fans but Alan Pardew insists it was the right decision

French midfielder Ben Arfa joined Hull City on loan during transfer deadline day after falling out with Pardew

‘It would have been an easy decision to keep him,’ Pardew said. ‘But you have to make tough decisions and I made the decision because I think the players we have here have a love and a passion for the club, the shirt and for the fans.

‘Is it a risk to let Hatem Ben Arfa go? Not in my opinion.’

Pardew brushed off the sackpardew.com website and a recent online poll where 85 per cent of fans called for his near four-year tenure to be brought to an end after a winless start to the season.

The Newcastle manager is under pressure from fans after allowing the talented Ben Arfa to leave

‘I respond to pressure like I always do,’ he said. ‘Everybody in the Premier League has it coming, but for me it’s come a little bit quicker than I expected and I have to deal with that.’

Cheick Tiote will not be available to start against Southampton this weekend after playing twice for the Ivory Coast despite an agreement from their FA to rest him.

Jack Colback is back in training after overcoming the calf problem that saw him pull out of the England squad, but Rolando Aarons faces a month on the sidelines with hamstring trouble. Argentinian striker Facundo Ferreyra is also ruled out with a back problem.
