Britain's aid funding came under fire again last night after an Indian spaceship reached Mars.

The country, which is receiving £1.1billion from Britain over four years, entered an elite club of nations to have put a craft into orbit round the Red Planet.

India spends vast sums on defence and even has its own overseas aid programme worth £328million a year.

But despite rapid economic development, it became the biggest net recipient of British aid in 2010 when it received £421million.

Britain’s overall aid spending will rise by 30 per cent this year as David Cameron hits his target of 0.7 per cent of economic output.

Spending on areas such as policing, prisons and defence have been slashed in recent years as part of efforts to cut Britain’s £90billion annual budget deficit.

On average, it lies 141.6 million miles from the sun.

With a diameter of 4,222 miles, it’s around half the size of the Earth and has an average temperature of -85F (-65C).

Gravity is much less powerful - slightly less than 40 per cent of ours.

The atmosphere is desperately thin – one per cent of Earth’s pressure – and  95 per cent of it is carbon dioxide.

It boasts the solar system’s biggest mountain – Olympus Mons, a dead volcano.

It measures 335 miles across and rises to a height of 88,000ft, which is almost three times higher than Everest.Mars has two cosmic sidekicks – the moons Deimos and Phobos.

Mars’s red colouring comes from the iron oxide that coats its surface.

Mars has huge amounts of ice at its polar caps.If they melted, it would cover the whole planet in water 11-metres deep, according to Nasa.

 

But aid spending is spiralling and this year will reach £12.6billion a year – more than the £12.1billion spent on policing.

In 2012 International Development Secretary Justine Greening announced that Britain will stop aid to India after this parliament.

The spacecraft – Mangalyaan, which means ‘Mars craft’ in Hindi – blasted off from a small Indian island on November 4 last year.

It arrived on schedule yesterday after a 485million-mile journey. The £45million project will see the satellite search for methane gas in the planet’s geology and atmosphere.

Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi said: ‘We have gone beyond the boundaries of human enterprise and innovation. We have navigated our craft through a route known to very few.’ But critics questioned why India spends so much on a space programme when so many of its people live in poverty. One economist condemned the space mission as a ‘delusional quest for superpower status’ at a time when half of Indian children are malnourished.

A poll last year found just one in four people supports Britain spending billions of pounds on foreign aid every year – and more than 60 per cent believe the cash is wasted. Jonathan Isaby, of the TaxPayers’ Alliance, said: ‘If India can afford this pioneering project then it is hard to justify sending a single penny of taxpayers’ cash in overseas aid when they could be doing more to help themselves.’

A spokesman for the Department for International Development said: ‘Not a penny of British taxpayers’ aid money has gone on India’s space programme.

‘India’s recent progress means that all financial grants from the UK to India will cease in 2015, after which we will focus on providing help in the form of private sector expertise and technical assistance that will also ultimately benefit British businesses and jobs.’

Tory backbenchers have urged Mr Cameron to abandon his aid target. But earlier this month, Downing Street backed a Lib Dem Bill which would enshrine the pledge in law. 

Nasa's Curiosity Rover Twitter account tweeted a congratulations message to ISRO's Mars Orbiter, to which it replied 'Keep in touch. I'll be around'

As India makes makes space history on Mars, Russia is hoping to do the same on the moon by 2030. 

The head of Roscomsos, Oleg Ostapenko, said plans were underway for a manned spacecraft to reach the moon by the end of the next decade.

The system will deliver cargo and cosmonauts to the moon, and someday also into the deep space, according to Ostapenko.

'Based on the results of lunar surface exploration by unmanned space probes, we will designate [the] most promising places for lunar expeditions and lunar bases,' Ostapenko said.

Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi in June endorsed the low-cost of the project, saying it cost even less than the budget 'Gravity' (pictured). The Hollywood blockbuster cost about $100 million to make
