Shamed ex-Cabinet minister Chris Huhne was still blaming everyone but himself yesterday for his spectacular downfall.

Huhne was jailed in March for perverting the course of justice by persuading his then wife to take his speeding points on her driving licence so he would escape a ban.

The eight-month sentence, of which he served only 62 days, brought his political career to a humiliating end. It followed months of lies in which he repeatedly denied the offence – only to admit his guilt on the eve of his trial.

Ex-Cabinet minister Chris Huhne claimed that his downfall was 'payback' for speaking out about phone-hacking

But Huhne claimed yesterday that he was the victim of a Press vendetta and his downfall was ‘payback’ after he spoke out about phone-hacking.

His attempt to blame the Press for his woes was quickly slapped down by Nick Clegg. Asked about Huhne’s ‘bizarre’ allegations, Mr Clegg – whom he challenged for the Liberal Democrat leadership – said : ‘It is his opinion. Is it exactly my opinion? No it isn’t.’

Huhne, 58, said the News Of The World targeted him to expose his affair with his aide Carina Trimingham, which resulted in the break-up of his marriage.

The Sunday Times then ‘groomed’ his ex-wife Vicky Pryce, he said, until she told the newspaper about taking his speeding points.

Miss Pryce, 60, was also convicted over the 2003 speeding incident on the M11 and jailed for eight months.

Sentencing the couple, Mr Justice Sweeney, told them ‘any element of tragedy is entirely your own fault’.

The judge told Huhne, whose attempt to avoid conviction ran up prosecution costs of more than £100,000: ‘Despite your high office you tried to lie your way out of trouble.’

Huhne has admitted he ‘lied and lied again’ but there was no mention of that in his column for yesterday’s Guardian, where he made his claims.

Of the exposure of his relationship with bisexual Miss Trimingham, 46 – weeks after he had cynically portrayed himself as a happy family man during the 2010 election – he wrote: ‘My endgame began when Neville Thurlbeck, the chief reporter of the now-defunct News Of The World, heard gossip that I was having an affair.

‘Rather than cheapskating on the proposed investigation by hacking my phone, the News Of The World put me under extensive surveillance by a retired policeman, a more expensive exercise.

'Why was News International prepared to invest so much to tail an opposition Liberal Democrat back in 2009?

Huhne claimed that his economist ex-wife Vicky Pryce was 'groomed' by The Sunday Times

‘Maybe it was coincidence, but that 
summer I was the only frontbencher who, with Nick Clegg’s brave backing,
called for the Metropolitan Police to reopen the voicemail-hacking 
inquiry into Rupert Murdoch’s empire.

The News Of The World sparked the end of 
my marriage, but another Murdoch title, the Sunday Times, then groomed 
my ex-wife until she told them about the speeding points.

‘The political editor bought dinners, sent flowers, offered breaks at smart hotels, and reassured her that she would not face any unpleasant consequences (such as prison).

‘Four successive weeks as the splash in the Sunday Times ensured our joint prosecution.

'The Crown Prosecution Service loves a celebrity trial. It was the end of my political career, and it locked up my ex-wife too.’

Huhne dismissed swapping the speeding points with his wife as something that ‘seemed like a minor matter’ and said an AA survey found that 300,000 motorists have done the same thing.

But he did concede he was ‘not proud’ of his behaviour and said the ‘personal consequences were  monstrous for my family and me’.

On Radio 4’s Today programme yesterday, Huhne acknowledged that he had made himself ‘vulnerable’ by asking his wife to take his points.

But he added: ‘Sometimes newspaper groups, media groups, have their own interests as well.

‘Murdoch in particular is exceptionally powerful and over many, many years, he has played the person rather than the issue and he has also used that political influence to bulldoze a way for his business interests.

‘The way in which this was specifically done was a very clear payback.’

Sunday Times editor Martin Ivens described Huhne’s claims as ‘bizarre,’ adding: ‘The Sunday Times pursued a legitimate story of considerable public interest.’

Nick Clegg said he did not 'exactly agree' with Huhne's claims (pictured together in 2007)

Mr Thurlbeck took to Twitter to hit back.
He said the Huhne was not a ‘Murdoch press target’ and that it had 
taken a year to persuade his editor to run the affair story.

Mr Thurlbeck added: ‘The “Murdoch press” thought Huhne was such a political minnow they didn’t want to run it. End of conspiracy theory.’

Former Labour minister Kate Hoey also criticised Huhne via Twitter.

‘So Chris Huhne blames Rupert Murdoch for his downfall. I thought he lied and broke the law. Some ex-politicians never learn,’ she said.

Asked whether it was fair for newspapers to expose Huhne’s lies, Mr Clegg said: ‘Newspapers play an incredibly important job in keeping people in positions of authority on their toes, uncovering wrongdoing where that takes place, uncovering the truth where it is not revealed.

‘That is the great tradition of British journalism.’

Huhne brazenly issued denial after denial of the driving licence claims. They included:

May 16, 2011: In a statement, Huhne says the allegations are ‘incorrect’. He adds: ‘They have been made before and they have been shown to be untrue.’ 

July 7, 2011: On Radio 4’s Today programme, he says: ‘I am saying there is no truth in those allegations ... If Cabinet ministers resigned every time wild allegations were made about them, you would find it difficult to get enough people around the Cabinet table.’ 

September 20, 2011: At the Liberal Democrat conference, Huhne says: ‘I’ve very clearly denied this. I continue to very strongly deny this.’ 

Asked if he would ‘swear it’, he says: ‘Absolutely. I’ve made that absolutely and abundantly clear.’ 

February 3, 2012: Resigning as Energy Secretary as he is charged, Huhne says: ‘I’m innocent of these charges and I intend to fight this.’ 

Despite his protestations yesterday, the Press’s right to report on Huhne’s affair was backed by the High Court last year. In a victory for Press freedom, Miss Trimingham lost a privacy and harassment claim.

Mr Justice Tugendhat ruled that a married MP’s ‘secret mistress’ is a public figure and rejected her claim for damages against the Daily Mail and Mail on Sunday.

He said she was ‘not the purely private figure she claimed to be’ because of her involvement with  Huhne ‘both professionally, as his press agent, and personally, as his secret mistress, in circumstances where he campaigned with a leaflet to the electorate of Eastleigh about how much he valued his family’.

In a damning judgment, in which he accused her of seriously exaggerating some of her evidence and described her as not a ‘good or reliable witness’, the judge added: ‘Miss Trimingham has shown little sign of recognising how what she herself has done has given rise to the publicity she finds so unwelcome.’
