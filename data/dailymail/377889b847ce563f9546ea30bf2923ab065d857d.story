The Tampa Bay Buccaneers head to the Georgia Dome to take on the Atlanta Falcons, with both teams looking to turn their early season form around. Last season, this NFC South divisional match-up was split 1-1 with the home team emerging victorious on both occasions.

The Falcons made an impressive start to the 2014 season with a 37-34 victory over divisional rival rivals the New Orleans Saints.

Quarterback Matt Ryan set a franchise record in that game, throwing for 448 yards and three touchdowns. Any euphoria that may have spilt over into Sunday’s game against Cincinnati quickly diminished as Atlanta’s deficiencies along the offensive line were exposed during a crushing 24-10 defeat by the Cincinnati Bengals.

Wide receiver Roddy White is in doubt for the Falcons after missing Monday's training with a hamstring injury

Ryan looked a shadow of himself, completing just 24 of 44 passes for 231 yards, and one touchdown. Ryan was under duress throughout the contest, throwing three interceptions and taking two sacks.

Wideout Roddy White missed training on Monday due to a hamstring injury and remains questionable. He would be a huge loss for the Falcons as White averages 11.4 yards per reception. With White listed as questionable, look for Harry Douglas and Devin Hester to have an increased role. Tampa Bay’s new defensive scheme under Lovie Smith will have their hands full trying to contain Douglas – who amassed 283 yards and two touchdowns last year.

Despite the play of rookie quarterback Mike Glennon during Tampa's miserable 2013 campaign, head coach Smith has opted to go with experience under centre. Josh McCown joined the Bucs on a two-year deal following an impressive stint in Chicago during Jay Cutler’s absence - recording 13 touchdowns and just one interception. However, McCown’s play from last season has yet to carry over into this season for the Buccaneers.

Another player who seems to revel in this this fixture is Bucs running back Bobby Rainey. The last time the two met, Rainey rushed for 163 yards and scored three touchdowns.

With Doug Martin out (knee) the Falcons will have their work cut out as the defense has surrendered an average of four yards per carry. Should the offensive line hold up for McCown, look for him to expose the Falcons secondary who give up a current league high of nine yards per reception.

Wideout Vincent Jackson has been McCown’s go-to guy during the team’s first two games, Jackson has been targeted 16 times, reeling in eight of those for 87 yards.

Rookie Mike Evans is growing in confidence with every snap and made an impressive 29-yard catch during the 19-17 loss to the St Louis Rams. Evans was shaken up late in the game, but is expected to play on Thursday.
