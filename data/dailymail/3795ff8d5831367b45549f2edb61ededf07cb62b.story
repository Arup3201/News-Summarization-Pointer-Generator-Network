Fabio Fognini, the irascible Italian due to meet Andy Murray in Wimbledon’s fourth round, is walking a disciplinary tightrope after threatening one of the tournament’s supervisors.

The 16th seed was slapped with unprecedented fines after telling respected tournament official Wayne McEwen that he would ‘smash my racket in your head’ during his heated first round against American Alex Kuznetsov.

Fognini runs the risk of suspension from Grand Slams if there is any repeat of his antics on Friday against South African Kevin Anderson in the third round after incurring what was a record fine of its type at Wimbledon.

Anger: Fabio Fognini has been slapped with fines for threatening Wayne McEwen during his first round win

The 27-year-old was docked $20,000 for the offence of damaging the grass court with his racket. He was fined an added $7,500 for abusing McEwen and making an obscene gesture at Kuznetsov.

Last year at Wimbledon he was fined $10,000 for smashing up the court surface, and at the Australian Open this year he receive code violations.

At this year’s Roland Garros he was fined $3,500 for unsportsmanlike conduct and racket abuse.
