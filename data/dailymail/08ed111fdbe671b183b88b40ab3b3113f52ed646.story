Hull City are making a bold bid to sign Aaron Lennon from Tottenham Hotspur.

Manager Steve Bruce has already taken Michael Dawson, Jake Livermore and Tom Huddlestone from White Hart Lane and hopes they can help convince the player to follow that trio and move north.

However, the stumbling block is a £7million price tag and high wages.

Lennon would also command high wages which Hull are unsure whether they would be willing to meet

Hull will look to stagger the payments but Tottenham also have interest from Stoke City and Everton also.

Bruce needs a striker and has been offered Lokomotiv Moscow’s Dame N’Doye.

However, he would prefer a loan and will consider putting greater funds into the purchase of Lennon for that extra attacking edge.
