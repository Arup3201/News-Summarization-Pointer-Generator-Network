Jessica Devins and her husband have a 'thing' with photobooths.

Stemming from their first date, the Minneapolis couple cannot walk past one without stopping.

Now married, it wasn't a tough decision for Devins to tell her hubby they are expecting.

Really?: She was also secret filming the moment on her propped-up phone

'I can't believe it': The father-to-be is completely overcome by the happy news

After having dinner at Pizzeria Lola, the couple went into the pizza shop's photobooth, according to 9 News.

She put her phone next to the camera and started filming.

Then right before the flash went off in the booth, she whipped out a little hat with the word 'baby' on it.

Her shocked husband takes a few seconds to realize what is happening, before being overcome with emotion and then happiness.

Devins posted the video to YouTube and it has since garnered more than 2.7 million views.

She thanked people for watching in the comments section.

'I'm so glad you like the video,' Devins wrote.

'We are just over the moon with joy and then to see how many people like our video is just heart warming!! 

'We posted it hoping that it would inspire someone else someday.'
