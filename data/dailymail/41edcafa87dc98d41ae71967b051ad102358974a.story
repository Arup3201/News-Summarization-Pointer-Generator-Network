A New York City plastic surgeon pleaded guilty to killing a former model during a botched liposuction procedure on Wednesday in return for only two-months behind bars.

Dr. Oleg Davie, 53, ignored the medical records of Isel Pineda which showed she'd undergone a heart transplant in 2004 performed by TV's Dr. Oz and falsified forms after her death to cover up his mistakes prosecutors said.

The disgraced surgeon pleaded guilty to a charge of criminally negligent homicide and falsifying records after originally being charged with manslaughter for Pineda's death in 2012 which would have carried a prison term of up to 15 years.

Death: Isel Pineda should never have been on the operating table having had the transplant in in 2004, making it unsafe for her to be given anesthesia

Pineda, 51, paid $3,200 for the procedure, described in online ads as being to 'lose the wobble'. She went into cardiac arrest before leaving Davie's office.

Paramedics tried to revive her but she was declared dead at Coney Island Hospital.

'You knew she had a heart condition but you performed the surgery anyway, didn’t you?' prosecutor Patrick Cappock asked in Brooklyn Supreme Court.

'Yes,' Davie answered.

According to The New York Post, Davie, who surrendered his medical license last year, was unapologetic to the victim's family when he left the courtroom on Wednesday.

'What happened here is tragic but not criminal,' said his lawyer, James DiPietro, who added that the deal was 'inherently fair'.

He noted that his client would have faced 15-years behind bars if he had decided to fight a manslaughter charge.

Instead he admitted to changing Pineda's records after she died and admitted he did not speak to her cardiologist despite knowing she had undergone a heart procedure.

Davie, who was on probation at the time of Pineda's surgery for 'professional misconduct' deleted all mention of her heart transplant and medication after the unsuccessful SmartLipo operation.

Paperwork found in Pineda's purse by her boyfriend suggested Davie knew about her heart disease and resulting life-saving operation that made her unsuitable for liposuction.

On it were details of the diagnosis and the anti-rejection rejection drugs she was taking.

'This woman should not have been operated on — period,' a top plastic surgeon told the New York Post. 'You don’t screw around with people like this. If he knew she had a heart transplant, he should have shown her the door.'

Davies appeared to have ignored the health issues when filling out Pineda's patient history form, on which he clearly marked 'no' where it asks whether she had ever been hospitalized.

Heartbreak: 'She was stunning. She would walk into a room and the music would stop,' said Pineda's ex-husband

He wrote that she had a 'mid-chest, old, well healed' scar, describing it as resulting from 'skin surgery' to remove a 'cyst'.

Pineda's scar would have stretched from the neck to her navel.

And while her family believe she didn't tell them she was having lipo due to embarrassment, she was never shy about discussing her heart transplant.

Last year her ex-husband, Jeffrey Mayer said, 'She was stunning. She would walk into a room and the music would stop,” adding that seeing Davie “brought all the pain and all the realness back.'
