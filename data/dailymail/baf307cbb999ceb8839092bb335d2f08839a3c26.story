Route: George Osborne is facing a row over claims he helped secure a detour in his constituency for the controversial HS2 rail line

David Cameron has been forced to defend George Osborne amid accusations he helped secure a £600million detour for the controversial High Speed Rail line to avoid losing votes.

Labour leader Ed Miliband said the Chancellor should concentrate on the economy rather than 'worrying about how to divert high-speed rail routes away from his constituency'.

But Prime Minister David Cameron said the route, unveiled earlier this week, would go 'right through the middle of the Chancellor’s constituency'.

The Labour leader said during Prime Minister's Questions: 'I have to say to the part-time Chancellor, he should spend more time worrying about the economy and less time worrying about how to divert high-speed rail routes away from his constituency.'

Mr Osborne’s Tatton seat in Cheshire lies along the route taken by the line to Manchester.

MailOnline has revealed that Michael Jones, the leader of Cheshire East council, issued a press release saying: 'Your MPs, George Osborne, Edward Timpson and I, have fought hard to keep the line away from Knutsford and Tatton, which we have been successful in achieving.'

Mr Miliband began to read Mr Jones’ comments but was cut off by Speaker John Bercow as the volume of heckling from Tory MPs threatened to drown out the Labour leader.

Mr Cameron said: 'Let me say on high-speed rail, which goes right through the middle of the Chancellor’s constituency, we are proud of the fact that it’s this Government that has taken the decision to invest.'

The Chancellor has insisted he played no part in the siting of the route – which runs through his seat in Tatton, Cheshire – before reaching Manchester Airport.

But critics have pointed out that there is a ‘bend’ in the line which means it avoids some of the more affluent parts of the constituency.

Yesterday – in a press release issued by Tory-run Cheshire East Council – its leader Michael Jones suggested that Mr Osborne had fought to keep the line away from the eastern side of the seat. This avoids Tatton’s so called ‘Golden Triangle’ of Tory-voting Prestbury, Wilmslow and Alderley Edge.

But within hours the council had retracted its statement – saying that it had made a mistake.

Mr Osborne sold his £900,000 constituency home near Macclesfield last January, two months before an interim report seen by the Daily Mail considered – but then rejected – running the disputed line far closer to the town than is now planned.

Detour: This map shows the government's proposed route for the HS2 line (in blue) which was announced this week passing through the west of George Osborne's Tatton constituency (highlighted in red). An earlier route (in black) which has been discounted would have passed straight through the affluent 'golden triangle' of Wilmslow, Knutsford and Alderley Edge

Influence: A spokesman for Mr Osborne said: 'We have made clear throughout the process that George has never sought to influence the route'

Critics are furious that the 
‘preferred route’ now takes a £600million ‘dog-leg detour’ around 
upmarket Alderley Edge, Knutsford, Wilmslow and Prestbury.

Protesters
have spoken of ‘high-speed hypocrisy’ – pointing out that no such 
consideration was shown to residents in the Tory heartlands around the 
Chilterns, Buckinghamshire and Warwickshire.

Mr
Jones added in his release: ‘This is great news for Cheshire East and 
for Crewe in particular. This decision firmly demonstrates the 
Government’s belief in Crewe and puts Crewe firmly at the centre of the 
North West’s growing economy. HS2 consolidates Cheshire East at the most
connected area in the UK.’

A spokesman for Mr Osborne said: ‘Cheshire East put something out but corrected it when they realised they were wrong. We have made clear throughout the process that George has never sought to influence the route.’

Hilary Wharf of the HS2Action Alliance said: ‘What a high-speed fiasco. Everyone knew the Government was desperate to avoid more opposition but it’s shocking if the Chancellor is both abusing his position and actually denying it.’

A report by HS2 Ltd delivered to the Government on March 29, 2012, makes clear that Whitehall advisers did consider a high-speed route going slightly to the west of Macclesfield. The route eventually chosen and announced on Monday goes well to the west of Macclesfield.

Insisted: Mr Osborne has said he played no part in the siting of the route - which runs through his seat in Tatton, Cheshire - before reaching Manchester Airport

The Transport Department said the Chancellor could not have known of the other route options until the full reports were published.

A spokesman said: ‘The design of the route through the Chancellor’s constituency followed the same process as it did everywhere else.

‘The initial preferred route has been chosen to provide the best possible service to Liverpool, Manchester Airport and West Coast Main Line links to Scotland. As elsewhere, the route balances passenger demand, cost, engineering and sustainability.’

In its ‘retraction’, the council said yesterday: ‘In a press release Cheshire East Council stated that George Osborne had fought hard to keep the HS2 rail link out of his constituency in Knutsford and Tatton.

‘In fact, this is not the case and MP George Osborne had no say whatsoever over the proposed route of the HS2 link.  We are happy to set the record straight.’
