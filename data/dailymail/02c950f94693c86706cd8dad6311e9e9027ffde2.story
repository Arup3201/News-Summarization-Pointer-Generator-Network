On Jordyn Miller's first day of primary school, the six-year-old cancer survivor refused to take off her hat.

After five months of chemotherapy and a long recovery from surgery, the kindergarten student from Wingham on the north coast of New South Wales, was most concerned about her missing long hair.

'She used to have beautiful, long curly hair that she used to love – she's a very girly girl and the chemo caused it to fall out which was a big deal for Jordyn,' Her mother Tarin Miller,33, told Daily Mail Australia.

On her first day of school, the six-year-old refused to remove her hat and was bullied for 'looking like a boy'

'When she first started school, she was shy about it and kids being kids used to tease her about looking like a boy. They'd call her ugly.' 

One of her daughter's coping mechanisms was to wear a pair of tights or a tea-towel on her head.

'One day Jordan just come out of her room with the tights on her head and said "this is my beautiful long hair" and Charli, being her little sister, just copied,' she said.

The sibling would spend entire days with tea towels or tights on their heads, even enlisting their cousin whenever she would visit.

When she was five year's old, a urine infection led to the discovery of a tumour in Jordyn's left kidney. She was quickly diagnosed with stage one cancer and was signed up for surgery to remove the organ.

According to Gary Nunn from the cancer charity Camp Quality, Jordyn is one of 10,000 children across Australia who are currently newly diagnosed, under treatment or in remission from cancer treatment.

Mr Nunn told Daily Mail Australia that after all the emotional and physical hardships endured by the children throughout their treatment, just as things are starting to look up, one of the most common problems they encounter is bullying.

'We've heard about everything from pointing and staring and: 'mummy, why does she looks so different?' to exclusion and isolation,' Mr Nunn said. 

'Exclusion is one of the more common ones, kids are often left out because other kids think that they can catch cancer and it's contagious.

Camp Quality has been performing a puppet show in schools across the country to encourage students to support  their peers who are suffering or recovering from cancer

'We hear it a lot and there was one incident of name calling recently where we had a mum ringing us up and saying her daughter was being called 'baldie' and some of the kids were taking off her beanie and throwing it and playing catch with it'. 

Camp Quality is determined to change this mentality and teach children that there is no need to cover up the effects of their cancer treatment, while educating their peers about how to be supportive and understanding of kids living with cancer.

The charity has been roaming the country with their educational puppet show on the request of parents and teachers, to expel the myths around cancer.

Gary Nunn, a spokesperson for the cancer charity, said that by the end of the show ,the kids are all cheering for the bald puppet character to take off her hat

The show discourages bullying and expels myths that children hold about cancer, including that it is contagious, encouraging them to support and include kids with 

Their show, which has been view by over 230,000 children in the last year and relies on public support to continue running, involves a bald cancer-patient puppet who tries to decide if she should take off her hat.

'By the end of the show the kids are all cheering for her to take off her hat,' Mr Nunn explains.

'Once our puppet show had come to one school, we heard of a girl who went back to her class and quietly removed her hat and she didn't wear it from then on. Once we teach the students about it, that child becomes a sort of hero for all they've been through and they have other children falling over themselves to be their friend.' 

After Mrs Miller asked Camp Quality to come to her daughter's school to perform their puppet show, she said there was an instant change in attitude.  

Now, whilst her hair is still much shorter than it once was, Jordyn - who is now in remission - often tells her mother how much she's looking forward to having long hair again.
