Nine months on from his fatal drugs overdose, Philip Seymour Hoffman's partner, Mimi O'Donnell stepped out with their three children on Sunday as they spent the day in an autumnal New York City.

Last seen in heart-wrenching and teary pictures at their father's funeral, the Oscar winner's son Cooper and daughters, Tallulah and Mimi skipped through Manhattan's affluent West Village neighborhood in high spirits.

Their mother, Mimi, chatted away to a female friend while the children carried on ahead through the fashionable, leaf-strewn area of the city where they once lived with their superstar father in a $4.4 million apartment.

Moving on... Philip Seymour Hoffman's partner Mimi O'Donnell enjoyed a family day out with children on Sunday in New York City's West Village nine months after his tragic death

With a shock of strawberry blond hair just like his much-missed father, Cooper, 10, led his sisters across the road while Tallulah and Mimi smiled and held hands.

Hauntingly, it was just blocks away in February that Hoffman, 46, was found dead in the $10,000-a-month West Village apartment he was renting nearby, after he moved out of the family home following his relapse into addiction.

The loving family seemed blissfully unconcerned during their afternoon outing through the West Village where they were regularly photographed with their famous father before his death from a cocktail of heroin, alcohol and prescription drugs.

Mimi, who dated Hoffman from 1999 until just months before his passing, concealed her eyes behind a pair of sunglasses as she donned a casual all black ensemble.

Hoffman, who won the Oscar for Captote, was remembered at an emotional funeral service in New York City in February attended by celebrity friends and his grief-stricken family.

His lifeless body was discovered surrounded by bags of heroin and used syringes and was found by his personal assistant and fried on the morning of February 2.

Hoffman had relapsed the year before and completed a stint to treat his addictions.

Following his death in February, it was revealed that Hoffman rejected his accountant's suggestion he set aside money for his three children because he didn't want them to be 'trust fund' kids, according to court documents.

In a July 18 filing in Manhattan Surrogate Court, the late actor's accountant David Friedman recalled conversations with Hoffman where the topic of a trust for his children was raised.

He said Hoffman wanted his estimated $35 million fortune to go his longtime partner O'Donnell.

According to the filing, Friedman said the Oscar-winning star treated O'Donnell 'in the same manner as if she were a spouse' as Hoffman told the accountant that he just didn't believe in marriage.

At the time the court-appointed attorney said the actor's will should be approved by the court because there wasn't anything suspicious about it.

Hoffman also said that he wanted his son to be raised in Manhattan, Chicago or San Francisco, an edict that was written before his daughters were born.

Despite the turbulent final months of his relationship with O'Donnell, Hoffman remained close to his children, seeing them most days.

He was also regularly spotted taking Cooper to basketball games.

'My spare time is really about hanging out with my kids,' Hoffman once told Us Weekly. 'If I'm free, a good chunk of that is going to be thinking about how to hang out with them.'
