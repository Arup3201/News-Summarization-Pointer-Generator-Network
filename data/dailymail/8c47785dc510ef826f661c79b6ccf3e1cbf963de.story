QPR boss Harry Redknapp defended his decision not to include Adel Taarabt in his starting line-up against Manchester United, as the R's fell to a second successive Premier League defeat on Saturday.

The 67-year-old, who had an extraordinary bust-up with the Moroccan earlier in the season, brought Taarabt in from the cold to start him in last Saturday's defeat at Burnley – with the 25-year-old putting in an assured display.

Despite that, Redknapp opted not to use him from the off against Louis van Gaal's side this time around, believing it to be too big a risk to change a system that has worked so effectively for Rangers at Loftus Road this term.

On whether he felt he made a mistake not starting Taarabt, Redknapp replied: 'I didn't think it was right to change a system which has worked so well for us at home this season.

'Our home form has been great and its been because we've played a certain way, and Bobby Zamora and Charlie Austin have been pivotal to that.

'He (Taarabt) did some bits and pieces and showed some good skill when he came on though. I just said to him downstairs get yourself fit as you're an amazing talent and could be vital for us this season.'

Second-half goals from substitutes Marouane Fellaini and James Wilson ensured Rangers remain in the bottom three, as Van Gaal's side got back to winning ways after last Sunday's defeat against Southampton.

Redknapp, though, insisted he was pleased with his side's display in the 2-0 loss - their first home league defeat since October.

He added: 'I felt it was one of our better performances at home this season – we were a threat to them for sure.

'I felt the system was working well again but when you're up against a side like United, they're always going to cause you problems as they've got world class players and we were outdone by exactly that.'
