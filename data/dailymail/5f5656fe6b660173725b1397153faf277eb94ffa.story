Scrambling to keep pace with the public's mood in the aftermath of the Sandy Hook Elementary School massacre, Hollywood executives cancelled the premiere of a third major film release in the wake of Friday's gun atrocity.

Quentin Tarantino's ultra-violent spaghetti western Django Unchained has had its premiere, which was due to take place on Tuesday, replaced with a private screening for cast and crew only. This follows the cancellation of Tom Cruises action movie, Jack Reacher and the editing of a trailer for that film.

'Our thoughts and prayers go out to the families of the tragedy in Newtown, Connecticut, and in this time of national mourning we have decided to forgo our scheduled event,' said producers the Weinstein Company.

Big names: But the cast of Django Unchained will not be appearing in Hollywood on Monday due to the Newtown tragedy

The cancellation of the highly anticipated Tarantino movie which stars Jamie Foxx and Leonardo DiCaprio follows the editing of a scene in which a sniper fires a semi-automatic gun from the latest Tom Cruise action film.

The third film to have its premiere canceled is Parental Guidance starring Billy Crystal and Bette Midler, but the film is not thought to be as controversial as Django Unchained or Jack Reacher - which both contain scenes of graphic violence, death, blood and shootings.

Django Unchained was scheduled for a Tuesday evening premiere at the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences, with stars Samuel L. Jackson, Jamie Foxx, Kerry Washington due to walk down the red carpet.

However, before the decision was taken out of their hands, Tarantino and Foxx offered varrying opinions on Hollywood's responsibility towards violence expressed in film.

Insensitive: It was felt having a premiere of the violent western Django Unchained would not be the right thing to do

Star Jamie Foxx said that the entertainment industry needs to begin to bear some responsibility for violent content and graphic movies.

'We cannot turn our back and say that violence in films or anything that we do doesn't have a sort of influence,' said Foxx. 'It does.'

However, Quentin Tarantino, whose career is littered with stylized and violent films such as 'Kill Bill' said that the issue was beginning to tire him.

'I just think you know there's violence in the world, tragedies happen, blame the playmakers,' said Tarantino said at a press junket on Saturday.

'It's a western. Give me a break.'

Samuel L. Jackson who also appears in Django Unchained told the LA Times: 'I don't think it's about more gun control. I grew up in the south with guns everywhere and we never shot anyone. This is about people who aren't taught the value of life.'

'I don't think movies or video games have anything to do with it.'

A total of 28 people died in the Newtown shooting when alleged gunman Adam Lanza opened fire in the school before taking his own life.

Of those who lost their lives, 20 were children between the ages of five and 10.

Following the shooting, the decision was also made to postpone the premiere of Tom Cruise's latest movie Jack Reacher, which had been scheduled to take place on Saturday night in Pittsburgh.

A statement from Paramount Pictures read: 'Due to the terrible tragedy in Newtown Connecticut, and out of honor and respect for the families of the victims whose lives were senselessly taken, we are postponing the Pittsburgh premiere of Jack Reacher.

'Our hearts go out to all those who lost loved ones.'

Celebrities throughout the world also took to Twitter to express their sadness over the tragedy, with many of them taking the tweet the National Rifle Association, the US group advocating gun use in America, directly.

Susan Sarandon wrote: 'How much more suffering & loss will it take before we better regulate the sale of arms in our country? Let @NRA know how you feel.'

And Ben Stiller added: 'Shocked and saddened by what happened today in Connecticut. We have to stop the access to guns in our country.'

Mother-of-two Kourtney Kardashain wrote on her Twitter page: 'If this tragedy doesn't change something in this country regarding guns...I just want to scream and cry. Deeply saddened. Praying.'

Meanwhile other big films set for release in the coming weeks, which includes Les Miserables, This is 40 and The Guilt Trip, held their premieres last week.

The next big studio release likely to have a likely to have a glamour premiere is Gangster Squad, the Warner Bros. mob drama co-starring Sean Penn, Josh Brolin and Ryan Gosling, which is released on January 11.

That film already had its release date pushed after the July shooting during a screening of The Dark Knight Rises in Colorado, because the studio needed time to excise a scene from the movie in which mobsters fire guns at people seated in a cinema.

A violent episode of hit Syfy show Haven was pulled on Friday night in the wake of the tragic Sandy Hook school shooting which left 28 people dead.

Then potentially sensitive episodes of Family Guy, American Dad and The Cleveland Show scheduled for broadcast by Fox on Sunday were also cancelled.

And in the music world, Ke$ha's latest single 'Die Young' has been removed form radio stations across the country in the wake of the Sandy Hook tragedy.

Ke$ha shockingly said that she never wanted to sing her controversial song in the first place, though she is credited as being one of its writers, TMZ first reported.

The ‘Tik Tok’ singer did not elaborate as to why she believed she was ‘forced’ to sing the song in the first place.

The singer took to Twitter on Tuesday to write: ‘I’m so so so sorry for anyone who has been effected (sic) by this tragedy. And I understand why my song is no inappropriate. Words cannot express.’

According to TMZ, 'Die Young' had reached 167 million listeners before Friday's shooting but had lost 19 million by Monday.
