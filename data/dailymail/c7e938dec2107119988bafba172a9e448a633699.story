With the world's eyes on Gleneagles in Scotland as Europe attempts to defend their Ryder Cup title from the United States, there will be plenty of wow moments at the beauty of the Perthshire course. 

But while we hate to burst the great event's bubble, it's not even the tip of the iceberg when it comes to epic golf havens. 

The Extreme 19th-Golf Hole  in Zhangjiajie in the Hunan province of China will host its own Celebrity Golf Challenge on Saturday with the centrepiece this 656-feet hole. 

Golfers will tee off a 263-feet cliff and onto the green, which is a pontoon resting on the jade waters of the Baofeng Lake.
