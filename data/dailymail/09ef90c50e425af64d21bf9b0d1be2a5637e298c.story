David Silva has been ruled out of the Manchester derby with a knee ligament problem.

Manchester City manager Manuel Pellegrini revealed that his Spanish playmaker will be out for three or four weeks after damaging his knee in Wednesday night’s Capital One Cup defeat at home to Newcastle United.

Not only with Silva miss Sunday’s Barclays Premier League clash with neighbours United, he will also be out of next week’s vital Champions League game at home to CSKA Moscow.

'David has a problem in his ligament,' said Pellegrini at this lunchtime press conference on Friday.

'Maybe he will be out around three weeks so he will not be available for the derby.'

Pellegrini also confirmed that another midfield player, Yaya Toure, has a groin problem but expects him to play against Louis van Gaal’s team.

'He has a small problem,' added Pellegrini. 'We will see him tomorrow but I think he will not have any problems to play.'

City go into the game against Manchester United amid an underwhelming run of form.

Pellegrini's men surrendered a 2-0 lead to draw 2-2 at CSKA Moscow last week and were then beaten at West Ham in the Barclays Premier League and knocked out of the Capital One Cup by Newcastle.

They could be nine points behind Premier League leaders Chelsea and there is a feeling City can ill afford many more slip-ups, even at this early stage of the season.

Pellegrini referred to a 'lack of trust' among his players after the Newcastle result but is convinced they will soon get back to their best.

He said: 'I think they know perfectly what we are doing and I am absolutely sure we will return to our normal performance.

'It is a very important game but every game has just three points, so it is very important for us to just add three points.'
