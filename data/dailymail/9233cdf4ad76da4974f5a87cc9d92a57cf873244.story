A betting firm was offering odds of 10-1 that Her Majesty would announce her decision to step down during her address to the nation

Leading bookmaker Coral has suspended betting on the Queen announcing her abdication in her speech on Christmas Day, following a rush of bets this afternoon.

The firm was offering odds of 10-1 that Her Majesty would announce her decision to step down during her address to the nation, but today's unusual gambling has instantly set alarm bells ringing, forcing Coral to close the market altogether.

'Throughout the year there has been major speculation about the Queen's future but today's gamble has really caught us by surprise,' said Coral's Nicola McGeady.

'As far as we are concerned there's no smoke without fire when bets like this come through all in succession, so we have decided to be safe rather than sorry and pull the plug on the market,' added McGeady.

A Palace spokesperson said they would not comment, but did highlight the pledges made by the Queen in her 21st birthday speech in 1947.

The young Royal said: 'I declare before you all that my whole life whether it be long or short shall be devoted to your service and the service of our great imperial family to which we all belong.'

In her June 1953 Coronation Day speech, she also said: 'I have in sincerity pledged myself to your service, as so many of you are pledged to mine.

'Throughout all my life and with all my heart I shall strive to be worthy of your trust.'

The Queen, 88, is due to become Britain’s longest- serving Monarch next year when she overtakes Queen Victoria’s reign of 63 years and seven months.

In contrast, Prince Charles has been heir to the Throne for all but three of his 65 years.

When Spanish King Juan Carlos of Spain announced his abdication, many Royal observers wondered if the Queen follow his example.

Juan Carlos, 76, is reported to have told courtiers that he stepped down because he wanted to hand over the throne while his son and heir, Crown Prince Felipe, 46, was still a young man to stop him ‘withering’ like Charles. 

The Queen's annual pre-Christmas lunch took place today at Buckingham Palace, attended by senior royals like Prince Charles, Princes William and Harry and the Duchess of Cambridge.

The meal is a royal tradition and allows her to catch up with more distant relations, who are not invited to join her at the Sandringham Estate in Norfolk on the 25th.

Last year John Prescott has come under fire for suggesting the Queen should abdicate because of a bout of ill-health.

The former deputy prime minister said he wanted to pass on concerns that the 86-year-old monarch was 'overburdening' herself.
