She's won plaudits for her increasingly glamorous sense of style and a state visit to Barbados proved no exception for the Countess of Wessex.

In spite of the tropical temperatures, the Countess looked cool and unruffled as she arrived at the Barbados Parliament building in the capital, Bridgetown.

Fresh from a half-term skiing trip to the upmarket Swiss resort of St Moritz, Sophie beamed broadly as she greeted the assembled crowd who had gathered to celebrate the Barbudian parliament's 375th birthday.

She also showed her style chops in an elegant 1950's-style polka dot sundress, accessorised with a simple pair of diamond earrings and a tan clutch bag.

But while the Countess was on hand to help Barbadians celebrate, her husband Prince Edward was nowhere to be seen.

Instead, he spent the day taking part in the Barbados Royalist Regatta, a sailing event staged by the Duke of Edinburgh Award scheme.

A combination of community service, sport, new skills and outdoor challenges, the four-part Duke of Edinburgh International Award is open to people aged 14 to 24 from all over the world.

Countries that take part in the international version include Barbados and Jamaica - the next stop on the royal couple's Caribbean tour.

While Prince Edward helped the Duke of Edinburgh boat during the Regatta, the Countess followed her visit to Parliament with a trip to meet local children at the Ann Hill and Irving Wilson schools.

During the 90-minute tour, Sophie was serenaded with a chorus of Michael Jackson's Heal The World by a choir of schoolchildren and was presented with a small gift that included a leather coin purse, a photograph and a handmade necklace.

The visit to the school was the final stop on the Royal pair's tour of Barbados, and the couple are due to arrive in Jamaica today.

During the visit, which is to promote the Duke of Edinburgh Awards scheme, the couple will meet the Governor-General, His Excellency the Most Hon. Sir Patrick Allen, and will visit the UWI Sports Medicine Facility and the Bustamante Hospital for children.
