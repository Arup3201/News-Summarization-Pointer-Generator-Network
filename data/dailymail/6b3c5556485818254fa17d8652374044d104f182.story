The niece of a BBC weatherman who stalked him after claiming she was his daughter killed herself after a long campaign of harassment, an inquest heard yesterday.

Former nursing sister Joanna Toner, 52, of Tiverton, Devon, had written letters to ex-presenter Bill Giles and she was charged with harassment - something for which she had previously been jailed.

But the mother-of-two failed to turn up to court and police discovered her dead on her bed three days later when they went round to her barricaded home.

A coroner yesterday ruled that Toner killed herself from a huge overdose of prescription drugs.

In 2000, Toner, then 40, was jailed for 30 months over her nine year-long obsession that Mr Giles was her father when she was his niece.

She made hoax bomb calls to the BBC and threatening calls to Mr Giles and his wife Maureen. Toner also poured lighter fuel over herself outside the BBC’s TV studios at Shepherd’s Bush, west London.

In 1998 she was jailed for six months for similar offences against the senior BBC weatherman - and she was banned from contacting him, the BBC and the Met Office.

She had stopped her campaign of harassment for a short while after going to jail - but resumed it again in 1999.

In 2000 her lawyer said she intended to pursue her claim about her parenthood through legal channels.

Toner’s obsession began in the late 1980s when her mother - who had a severe alcohol problem - claimed that Mr Giles was Joanna’s natural father.

Toner stayed with Mr Giles and his family when he was married to her aunt but the couple later divorced and he remarried in 1991. In 2000, Mr Giles said: ‘I feel very sorry for her.’

At yesterday’s inquest in Exeter, it emerged that Toner had sent more letters to Mr Giles in Oxfordshire in 2012.

'I am sure she took her own life and intended to do so'

Coroner Andrew Cox

Her daughter Dawn Taylor told the coroner that she had ‘sent a letter to Bill Giles’ before she died but she had not seen any of the letters.

Coroner Andrew Cox said ‘the details of suicide notes were very personal in nature’ and Miss Taylor said she would find out more details of them from the police in private rather than in the public hearing.

The inquest heard Toner failed to turn up in court in September 2012 at Exeter to answer the new harassment allegations. A warrant for her arrest was issued by the court.

When police went to her home it was barricaded from the inside and all the windows were locked.

They forced their way in and found Toner dead next to empty packets of pills - and toxicology tests revealed she had taken a massive overdose. She also left several notes.

The coroner was told that Toner had been to see her GP but had ben abusive in the surgery and left without getting a sick note - and without that her benefits had been stopped after she ‘got angry at the Job Centre’.

The inquest heard she suffered from chronic depression which dated back to the 1980s and hip and back pain.

'Various things were pressing on her. She was in court. She had been bailed for an offence of harassment, failed to attend and a warrant was issued for her arrest'

Detective Sergeant Angus Cottey, Devon & Cornwall Police

Neighbours told police she was ‘unusual, really friendly but kept herself to herself’ although male friends did visit her at her home.

Detective Sergeant Angus Cottey of Devon & Cornwall Police said handwritten suicide notes were found and there were no suspicious circumstances and no third party involvement in her death.

He said: ‘Various things were pressing on her. She was in court. She had been bailed for an offence of harassment, failed to attend and a warrant was issued for her arrest.

‘We had to break in. She had barricaded inside and the windows would not open anyway. It was very secure. There were no signs of a struggle or assault.’

Coroner Mr Cox recorded a verdict of suicide, saying: ‘I am sure she took her own life and intended to do so.’
