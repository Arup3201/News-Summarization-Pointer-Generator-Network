John Lewis’s Christmas advert has given the retailer its best ever start to the festive period.

The department store took £101million in the week after The Bear and the Hare first aired – the earliest it has ever topped £100million in the Christmas build-up.

But while the marketing campaign set new records for sales, its heart-warming story is one some viewers say they have seen before – 33 years ago.

Asleep: The advert's bear in his cave before waking up to see Christmas for the first time

Hibernating: Yogi and Booboo settle down for a winter's sleep but are woken by friends

The concept featured in the classic children’s film Yogi’s First Christmas, made in 1980 by American studio Hanna-Barbera.

John Lewis denied that the film had any influence on their creative team at advertising agency Adam & Eve DDB.

But viewers were quick to point out the similarities this week, with some even accusing the company of ‘ripping off’ the film.

They pointed out that both stories focus on hibernating bears seeing their first Christmas – and both feature a magic alarm clock.

Film critic Scott Jordan Harris wrote on Twitter: ‘The John Lewis Christmas ad is lovely (though no 2011 Xmas ad). And, wonderfully, it owes something to Yogi’s First Christmas. #bearandhare.’

Charlie Talbot said: ‘Surely it is just the plot of Yogi’s First Christmas? Or am I the only one who remembers this classic...’ Robert Graham added: ‘John Lewis ripping off Yogi’s first Christmas.’

The advert, which was first broadcast two weeks ago today, cost £7million to make. But it has already had nearly six million views on YouTube and the store’s takings for the week ending November 16 were £101.45million – 10 per cent up on 2012 and 19 per cent on 2011.

The animated advert tells the story of a bear who always misses Christmas because he is hibernating – until his friend the hare buys him a John Lewis alarm clock. He is woken in time for December 25, when he emerges from his cave to discover a beautiful Christmas tree and his animal friends celebrating.

The plot bears a striking resemblance to the Yogi Bear film, often shown at Christmas in the 1980s.

Yogi and his friend Booboo go to bed for the winter, setting their magic alarm clock for spring. But they are woken just before Christmas by friends who enlist Yogi to ‘save Christmas’ from the troublesome Snively and Herman.

Response: The store denied their creative team had been influenced by the 1980 film

Philip Hesketh, who worked in advertising for 20 years, said taking inspiration from other sources was part of the creative process.

‘Any creative person will be exposed to a range of influences in their lifetime, going back to childhood,’ he said. ‘Often these influences are stored in the subconscious brain, and you can’t unlearn what you’ve already learnt.’

A John Lewis spokesman said the advert was unique, adding: ‘Our creative team wasn’t aware of Yogi’s First Christmas … the stories are very different. Fortunately for our bear, all the characters in the John Lewis ad love Christmas.’
