Barcelona boss Luis Enrique and Brazilian captain Neymar have both heaped praise on Lionel Messi by labelling the Argentine the best player in the world.

Real Madrid new boy Javier Hernandez became the latest player to wade into the Messi versus Cristiano Ronaldo debate shortly after sealing a move to the Santiago Bernabeu, however Neymar and Enrique have both backed the Barcelona man.

Messi created Neymar's two second half goals against Athletic Bilbao which has led to the former Santos attacker publicly lauding his Barcelona team-mate.
