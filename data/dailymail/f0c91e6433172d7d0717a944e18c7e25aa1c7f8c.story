Officer Dennis O. Simmonds was on duty on Thursday when he died following a 'medical emergency'. He was due to receive a bravery award from President Obama

The father of a 28-year-old police officer who died Thursday while working out at a gym said his son may have suffered a fatal brain aneurism less than a year after he was wounded during a shootout with the Boston Marathon suspects. 

Officer Dennis O. Simmonds was on duty at around 1.30pm and in the police academy gym on his lunch break when he suffered a medical emergency, police spokesman Sgt. Michael McCarthy said.

The officer was rushed from the Boston police academy in Hyde Park to hospital where he died after attempts to resuscitate him.

No official cause of death has been released in connection to the 28-year-old's medical emergency. 

On
 April 19 last year, Officer Simmonds was involved in the shooting with 
the Boston marathon bombers in Watertown, Massachusetts.

One of the suspects threw an explosive at him causing the officer to suffer a head injury from the blast. 

Officer Simmonds, known to his loved ones as 'DJ,' received the Schroeder Brothers Memorial Medal, the highest award given by the department for bravery, just a few weeks ago. He was set to travel to Washington DC next month to be honored by President Barack Obama.

According to his father, Dennis Simmonds Sr, his son loved his job with a passion.

'He knew what he wanted to do from a very young age,' an emotional Mr Simmonds told the station Fox25. 'He wanted to be an officer.'

The Randolph native enrolled in the police academy straight out of college to pursue a career in law enforcement.

Simmonds joined the Boston police when he was 22 years old and began working in the Youth Violence Strike Force in 2012. At the time of his death, Simmonds was studying for the sergeant's exam.

'He was "grab the bull by the horns" - that was DJ,' Mr Simmonds said, with his voice trembling. 'There was no holding back. It was 100 per cent or nothing.'

In
 a statement, the Boston Police Department said: 'Officer Simmonds, 
assigned to the Youth Violence Strike Force was rushed to the hospital 
yesterday after suffering a medical emergency.
