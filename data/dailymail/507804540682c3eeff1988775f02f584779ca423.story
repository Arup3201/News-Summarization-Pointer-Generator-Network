He's probably just as famous for his luscious flowing hair as he is for his football but now Robbie Savage has chopped off his ponytail in favour of a smooth, short back and sides style.

The footballer, 40, claims he decided on the change after arriving at 
the airport ahead of the World Cup with his wife's passport - because 
they both shared the same hairstyle in their pictures.

The Strictly Come Dancing star also admits he wants to 'grow old gracefully' with his new modern haircut - and his hairdresser reveals how the pair decided to change his hair.

The former Manchester United and Leicester midfielder was famed for his flowing blonde locks, but there's no denying his new style makes him look miles better and perhaps a tad younger.

Many women deicde to go for the chop around 46 in favour of 'a more mature style' according to new research, and it seems Robbie's decided to do the same now he's approaching his 40s.

He bravely posted an image on his Twitter account showing off the results.

Speaking to The Mirror, Savage said: 'I turn 40 in October, and although age is only a number, there comes a time when you have to grow old gracefully.

'I’ve left the 1980s and 1990s behind, and finally I’ve caught up with the modern world - and I feel liberated. It’s literally a big weight off my shoulders!'

Femail caught up with Robbie's hairdresser Howard Yuill, who has a salon in Altrincham, and discussed the hair change.

'I've been cutting Robbie's hair for a little while now and we'd been talking for some time in regards to changing it,' he said.

'I do a lot of Man City players [hair], cyclists, cricket celebrities and other sporting people because of the area that the salon is in...

'The day Robbie got the chop was a big day for him. He's so well known for his hair and that particular style, being so long and so blonde - it's not something that he took lightly.

'It was more Robbie's decision to go for it. We had a few consultations of which way to go and how short to go.

'My job is to make people look good so the challenge was to come up with something that would suit his face shape. He has a love of fashion as well as hair. The quiff and the 1950s pompadour styles now are really big these days, so we used that influence but kept his hair sharp as well as it being able to mess about... with that style you can dress it up and scruff it up as well.

'He was nervous but a good client to have in the chair. I think he's getting to that age now where he's looking for a change, but at the same time you don't want to lose your identity. I'm 47 and the one thing I've realised is as you get older you should do what you feel.

'Robbie's hair had been the same for a while... no-one's really wearing that shape any more, almost a bob style. I was telling him at the end of the day that hair was passé - I was reinfocring what he wanted to do.

'We are going to be tweaking it and changing it... we didn't want to do too much at once because he was attached to it for so long. Not everyone likes change.'

Celebrity and runway stylist, Matthew Curtis, whose clients include Cheryl Cole and Dita Von Teese:

'In some cases, getting the chop on long hair can help men look younger because generally, going for a tighter style on the sides slims down the face and accentuates the jaw line, giving a more handsome look.

'I don't necessarily think there's a definitive age men should go for a chop; it's all down to suitability taking into consideration factors such as face shape, weight and quality of hair. For example if the hair is ageing, thinning and generally in bad condition then it makes sense to go for a style that gives the impression of  thicker hair. A great way to make the hair appear denser is to go for a shorter style just as Robbie has.'
