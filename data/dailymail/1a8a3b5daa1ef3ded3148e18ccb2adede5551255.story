Robert Lawrence was shot in the head while fighting in the Falklands War

Warfare is seldom out of the news nowadays. Yet very few of us have ever experienced the horror of it. Robert Lawrence is an exception. Robert, 54 – who is currently selling Bradshott Farm, his barn conversion near Selborne in Hampshire – won the Military Cross in the Falklands War when, as a Scots Guards officer, he took part in the assault on Mount Tumbledown.

‘I still love soldiering,’ he says, carrying a slight limp and a withered arm as he leads me across the gravelled boules court at the front of the barn complex. ‘I’d be back in Ukraine or Iraq now if I had the chance.’

It is a surprising admission, especially considering the full story of Lawrence’s last battle, on June 13, 1982, the final day of the Falklands War. After a fierce firefight, during which he shot 14 Argentine soldiers, he ran out of ammunition. Undeterred, he then stormed the enemy defences, stabbing three of them with his bayonet. As he stood on the top of Tumbledown Mountain, he turned to one of his men and shouted: ‘Isn’t this fun!’ At that moment a sniper’s bullet hit the side of his head, blowing away 43 per cent of his brain.

Unsurprisingly, the following years involved some grim periods of rehabilitation – and also saw him write a bestselling book that became the Bafta-winning TV movie Tumbledown, starring Colin Firth as Robert.

In 2002, Robert and his wife, Marion, 55, embarked on a demanding new project – which proved very therapeutic for him: they decided to site-manage the conversion of a derelict old barn. ‘It was not unlike a military exercise,’ Robert says. ‘It was something to get my teeth into with a bunch of men and it meant leading by example, making the right decisions quickly.’

It was an ambitious project. The U-shape Victorian barn that the couple bought for £680,000 was an ugly red-brick structure with oil tanks in the garden. Transforming it cost more than £2 million and took 11 months.

Bad barn conversions lose control of proportions and scale – bits of spare space make rooms that have no obvious use, and open-plan design can create a furniture-store showroom effect.

The Lawrences’ conversion, however, is a mixture of cleverly planned, functional rooms – kitchen, study, snug and library – in the right portion of the main building, leaving space to the left for the real show-stopper, jokingly referred to as the ‘great hall’.

The main problem posed by the barn was the absence of any interesting features. They set about adding their own. Today, Indian carvings serve as stanchions above the 17th Century Chinese doors in the kitchen. Gothic-style stone arches add an ecclesiastical tone.

Price: £2.7 million

Location: Near Selborne, Hampshire

Bedrooms: Six (plus three in cottage)

Unique features: Swimming pool, ‘great hall’, fish pond, 2.5-acre grounds

There is hand-painted wallpaper in the downstairs bathroom, where, incidentally, Robert keeps his medals. The book shelves dividing the landing from the snug have all been beautifully hand-crafted and there is a bed from a Far East opium den where you may have expected to find a sofa.

The attention to detail in the hall must have driven the architect, Richard Ashby, to distraction. At first, British oak boards for the floor ‘looked too laminated’ – they wanted broad boards with more knots. French boards weren’t right. Eventually they found the perfect look in Germany. Who was behind such meticulous work?

‘We share it,’ says Marion, a former actor and designer. ‘Robert is amazing at visualising space and organisation. I’m the sourcer. I fine-tune the feel of the interior.’

The two wings to the barn also work well, as the bedrooms for the couple’s children, Conrad, 27, Court, 23, Max, 19, and Matilda, 17. There are yet more thoughtful touches – each bedroom has a mezzanine and the master bedroom opens on to a lovely little rose garden. The property stands in 2½ acres of grounds – and even and includes a separate detached cottage.

Nowadays Robert, who has also worked in film production, mixes business interests in property with charity work: he gives talks to – and runs motivational expeditions for – injured veterans.

The children flying the nest has prompted the Lawrences to look for somewhere smaller, and Robert refuses to be sentimental over the selling the barn, which is on the market for £2.7 million. 

However, just before I leave he shows me an email he has just received. It is from one of the Argentine troops he fought against in that war of 32 years ago, addressing him in the most glowing terms.

‘I feel more simpatico to soldiers like that than I do for some civilians I meet,’ he says. ‘I loved military life – the decision-making and the precision of it all. After that, the trivia of day-to-day life seems awful.’

It is hard to avoid the thought that wherever Robert Lawrence moves to next, Mount Tumbledown will never be far away.
