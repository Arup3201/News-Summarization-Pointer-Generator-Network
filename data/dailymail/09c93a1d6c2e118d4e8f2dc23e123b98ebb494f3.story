Josie Cunningham had apparently been in talks with a pound shop to sell DVDs of her third child's birth

Controversial wannabe glamour model Josie Cunningham has taken to Twitter to vent her anger after a pound shop ‘pulled out’ of a deal to sell DVDs of her upcoming child’s birth.

The heavily-pregnant single mother, who provoked national outrage after getting a boob job on the NHS, had apparently been in talks with a pound shop to sell DVDs of her third child’s birth.

However, the 23-year-old, from Leeds, appeared to confirm the deal would no longer be going ahead today by tweeting: ‘Actually fuming!!!!!!! As if a poundshop has just pulled out of my child birth DVD deal!!!!!!!! So, angry!!!’

Ms Cunningham shot to notoriety last year when she had a £4,800 NHS-funded operation to increase her bust from size 32A to 36DD, claiming she had been bullied since she was 14 for having a flat chest.

She has since gone on to make a name for herself over the past 12 months by selling a number of stories, including how she received Botox on the NHS for her sweat problem and debated aborting her unborn baby for the chance to appear on Big Brother.

Talk of her latest money-spinner - a possible DVD of her child’s birth - was announced in May, when she said: ‘By selling DVDs of the birth, people will get to see my maternal side. I love One Born Every Minute - it'll be just like that.’

However, after receiving backlash when seemingly confirming the deal was over today, she responded by posting: ‘People may laugh, but think about it! 500 stores x 500 copies each equals a s**t loads of £’s! (sic)’

She later informed her fans she was going shopping because ‘retail therapy’ was the only way to ‘make herself feel better’.

A representative for Ms Cunningham was unable to confirm which pound store she had been in talks with and said: ‘Sadly we cannot give any more information at this time.

‘We entered an agreement in the early stages agreeing not to name the store until the deal was finalised.

‘Sadly I can only refer to it as a pound store, if it’s any help.... we can rule out the 99p store.’

Ms Cunningham has previously admitted to not knowing who the father of her unborn child is, claiming she fell pregnant while working as a £1,000-a-night escort.

She has also admitted to considering having her unborn baby aborted so she could appear on Channel 5’s Big Brother.

She said she had been on the shortlist to appear on the reality television show - but was reluctant to proceed because of her pregnancy.

It was while working as an escort that Ms Cunningham had the breast augmentation which she has become infamously known for.

The operation was funded by the same NHS trust which refused to fund surgery that would have enabled a two-year-old girl with a form of cerebral palsy to walk.

After the enlargement, Ms Cunningham claimed her breasts were ‘so big’ she found them embarrassing, and enraged the nation further by claiming the NHS should pay for a reduction.

The retired escort celebrated her pregnancy with a naked pregnancy shoot, showing off her stomach tattoo

The wannabe glamour model has previously caused outrage by posting controversial tweets, including this one

She then tried to placate public opinion by promising to pay back the cash but admitted she could not uphold her pledge when she fell pregnant.  

She now continues to soak up public funds and even receives state-funded transport to take her children to school because of the 'negative attention' she receives on public transport.

It means that since May, she and her children have been driven in taxis the two-and-a-half miles to and from the local school, twice a day. The journey would cost around £30 a week by bus.
