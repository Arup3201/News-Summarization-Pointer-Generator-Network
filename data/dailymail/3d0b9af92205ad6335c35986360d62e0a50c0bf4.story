A mother candidly details her family's experience of 'raising a boy who is a girl at heart' in a new book titled, Raising My Rainbow.

Lori Duron from Orange County, California, tells how her six-year-old son, CJ loves dressing in girls' clothes, practicing his 'fashion walk' in front of the mirror and prefers sewing to playing soccer.

In an interview with Today this morning, to mark the release of her book, she said her biggest fear for CJ 'is his safety outside of the home because I know people can be rude and have really negative reactions to him.'

CJ, who is getting ready to start first grade, says he started liking 'girls' stuff' after he found a Barbie in the back of his mother's closet. He was just two-and-a-half years old.

After many conversations, Mrs Duron and her husband Matt made a conscious decision to let their son 'be who he was born to be'.

Recalling their first visit to a toy store after the 'Barbie incident', mother-of-two, Mrs Duron said: 'I took him to the pink aisles which I had been hiding from him - just because we have boys, so we went to the blue aisles.

''[When] he saw those pink aisles . . . he just lit up and stood there and took it all in.'

Meanwhile CJ's older brother, Chase, preferred to stick to the blue aisle. Six months after making his love of dolls clear, CJ began to gravitate towards girls' clothes.

'It's a whole different thing, when you realize that your son is really into all things girl and really is a girl at heart'

Mrs Duron said that he 'sabotaged' her laundry work, took an orange tank top and reappeared wearing it as a dress with a pair of her high heels and a 'mischievous grin'.

Mr Duron, a police officer from a male-dominated family 'full of jocks', says that he and his wife were confused and concerned about CJ’s behaviour at first.

'It’s a whole different thing, when you realize that your son is really into all things girl  . . .and really is a girl at heart.'

In a bid to connect with other parents in their situation Mrs Duron started an anonymous blog under the same title as her book, and was soon inundated with similar stories from readers all over the world.

'We're trying to raise CJ to be a strong, confident person and hope for the best and watch out for bullying and teasing'

'It was weird for me to realize that this is a global parenting issue,' she said.

In the blog she would detail CJ's day-to-day antics.

One post tells how CJ designed his own dress in a hot pink, leopard-print fabric and paired it with 'pink glitter spandex leggings'.

And another details how CJ 'skipped' in the air when Mrs Duron said he could inherit her wedding gown.

She writes: 'I’m glad that I didn’t purge the dress before I had kids.  I’m glad that I resisted the urge once I had only boys.

'Because my boy loves fashion, lace, beading and all things princess-like.  And, he wants my dress and he’s going to love it.'

She cites the words of encouragement she received from readers as a great source of support.

Now, she hopes her book will educate more people about gender nonconformity.

Asked if there are ever instances when he wishes CJ would 'pick up a baseball bat instead of playing with Barbie dolls', Mr  Duron said 'yeah, I mean there's definitely days of frustration.'

However, he highlights that the biggest thing he's learned is to 'love your child no matter what.'

'I mean this is an evolution. From where we were when we started noticing this and where we are today, we've grown in leaps and bounds as parents, both of us.

'You know, we've built a house based in love and trust and a safe environment and that's the most important thing I can give to my kids.'

Mrs Duron concludes: 'We're trying to raise [CJ] to be a strong, confident person and hope for the best and watch out for bullying and teasing.'
