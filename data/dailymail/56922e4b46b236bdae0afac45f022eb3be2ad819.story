The highly divisive nature of FA chairman Greg Dyke’s England Commission was demonstrated by the answer an FA councillor received when asking about the conspicuous lack of schools football in the report.

Peter Beverley, a former McKinsey consulting executive who has led Dyke’s research team, told John Reid, the English Schools FA representative, after a Wembley presentation: ‘I did not know they still played football in schools.’

This infuriated Reid, especially as schools football is seen by many as an area that should have been investigated by Dyke’s commission.

Finger pointing: There were surprising omissions from Greg Dyke's England proposals, including schools football

Another strange omission in the report was any mention of the proposed north-south regionalisation of lower-league football that had been championed by Glenn Hoddle during Commission meetings.

It is understood that was pulled from the final, hastily-put-together report at the last moment, despite forming part of the original draft.

The most bizarre aspect of the Wembley briefing was that Greg Dyke chose to have ex-England full back Danny Mills, the surprise choice on the Commission panel, to his right. Dyke had difficulty getting a word in edgeways, so often did Mills and his fellow panellist, former Leeds manager Howard Wilkinson, hijack questions aimed only at Dyke.

Leeds' former managing director David Haigh was interviewed by Yorkshire Police on Thursday over the installation of spy cameras within Elland Road following complaints made by new owner Massimo Cellino alleging misuse of club funds for the purchase of the equipment.

Haigh said in a statement that surveillance devices were quite properly paid for by the club and were put in place following reports to him alleging the use of Class A drugs within the club. However, the police are only looking into the alleged misuse of funds rather than any perceived drugs culture at the troubled club.

THE FA’s search for a £9million-a-year Cup sponsor to replace Budweiser next season may end with the Turkish-owned household appliance giants Beko stepping up from their lower-tier supply deal. Beko have the financial power for a big football partnership, although their sports sponsorships focus on basketball.

Clubs’ £50m VAT bill

The Premier League are understood to have negotiated for around 15 of their clubs to pay a total of £50million in tax to settle a VAT dispute.

It concerns agents who exploited a grey area in the regulations by claiming they represented clubs rather than players, who never want any avoidable extra tax landing on their bill.

The vast payments emerged during a court case involving agent Tony McGill, who is suing Bolton Wanderers and others for being cut out of the £1m Gavin McCann transfer from Aston Villa to Bolton in 2007.

Bolton chairman Phil Gartside told the court his club had paid £1.8m to settle their dual representation issue, which was a ‘relatively small amount compared to others’. It is believed Tottenham, Manchester United, Manchester City and Newcastle sorted out their tax affairs without PL assistance.

The Joey Barton autobiography due out in August must be causing publishers Penguin plenty of angst judging by the extraordinary reaction of commissioning editor Dan Bunyard to a harmless enquiry about the date of publication.

Bunyard, who is in charge of the Barton project, put the phone down while shouting ‘Scum’. When asked later about this offensive attitude to newspapers, he said: ‘I apologise but I was angry about having to answer so many questions about the book.’

It will only add to hostilities between the Premier League and the FA that Greg Dyke chose to rush out his recommendations on a day when PL chief executive Richard Scudamore was due to hold media interviews about Sunday’s climax to the season.

The PL claim their Under 21 league, panned by Dyke in his report, offers a better technical challenge for young players than the FA proposals. And top-flight insiders compared him picking off individual clubs for support rather than the PL collective to his predecessor Lord Triesman’s tactics when he took on the PL over debt.
