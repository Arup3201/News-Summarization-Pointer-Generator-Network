Greek police said today they have arrested a childless couple in Athens on suspicion of buying an eight-month-old Roma girl and trying to register her as their own.

The arrest comes amid an international search for the parents of another little girl known as Maria who was found living with unrelated Gypsies in Greece.

Bulgarian authorities are now trying to establish whether local Roma woman Sasha Ruseva, 35, is the mother of Maria, a strikingly-fair girl aged 5 or 6.

The woman has been tested for a DNA match and served with preliminary charges of child selling, but has not been detained.

The case of Maria has drawn global 
attention, playing on the shocking possibility of children being stolen 
from their parents and sold. But its handling by media and authorities 
raised has concerns of racism toward the European Union's estimated 6 
million Gypsies - a minority long marginalized in most of the continent.

The couple arrested in Athens on Wednesday allegedly paid a Roma woman 4,000 euros (£3,400) for the baby, a Greek police statement said. Authorities are looking for the baby's birth parents and potential intermediaries in the alleged transaction.

The suspects, aged 53 and 48, were expected to be charged later today with child abduction, which under Greek law can include cases where a minor is voluntarily given away by its parents outside the legal adoption process. 

The same charges were brought against the couple with whom Maria was found living in a Roma settlement outside Farsala, in central Greece, a week ago. They have been jailed pending trial and are also suspected of fraudulently obtaining birth certificates for a total 14 children.

Scam? Greek authorities are trying to work out whether the children all exist, or whether the alleged document fraud was part of a welfare scam - the couple allegedly received more than 2,500 euros a month in family benefits

Greek authorities are trying to work out whether the children all exist, or whether the alleged document fraud was part of a welfare scam - the couple allegedly received more than 2,500 euros a month in family benefits.

They insist they were looking after Maria with their own five children after an informally arranged adoption.

The girl was placed into the care of a children's charity and her DNA details were provided to Interpol which has so far failed to match her to any missing children declared in its records, from Poland to the U.S.

Charges: The same abduction charges were brought against the couple with whom Maria was found living in this Roma settlement outside Farsala, in central Greece, a week ago

It comes after mother-of-ten Mrs Ruseva, the Bulgarian Roma woman believed to be the real mother of Maria - dubbed the 'blonde angel' - demanded authorities hand her daughter back.

Mrs Ruseva, 35, claimed she did not sell Maria, now four, but was forced to leave her daughter with a friend in Greece as a baby because she could not afford the legal documents required to take her home to Bulgaria.

But the Daily Mail can reveal that a woman of her name has twice previously been arrested for trying to sell babies in Greece – and on both occasions skipped bail.

A DNA test has confirmed Sasha Ruseva a Bulgarian Roma woman is the mother of a mystery girl known as Maria, found living with a couple in Greece

The Mail tracked down Mrs Ruseva, who police believe will be shown by DNA tests to be Maria’s real mother, to an impoverished gypsy camp in Nikolaevo in rural Bulgaria where her family share a one-room home without running water.

Her husband Atana Rusev, 37, has an albino gene in his family that may have resulted in Maria’s blonde hair and pale complexion.

Five of the couple’s other children are blonde and closely resemble Maria.

Mystery has surrounded the identity of the parents of the blue-eyed girl since she was discovered after police raided a Roma gypsy camp in central Greece last week.

A couple who posed as her parents for four years to make money from her begging are believed to have bought the child for £850.

Maria’s case attracted global attention, with thousands of calls from people who believe they may know her identity.

Mrs Ruseva wept yesterday as she insisted: ‘I did not sell Maria, nor did I give her away. For the past four years I have never forgotten Maria. I pray for her every day. I want her back, I want her back.’

Mrs Ruseva, who was just 13 when she had her first child, said she was pregnant with Maria when she went to Greece to work as a field hand on a farm with her husband.

She said her eldest daughter remained in Bulgaria to look after her other children but that arrangement stopped when she got married and wanted to move out, forcing Mrs Ruseva to return home.

She claimed she could not bring Maria back with her as the Greek authorities required she pay ‘hundreds of euros’ for a birth certificate for her daughter, which she could not afford.

She said: ‘I gave birth to Maria about four and a half years ago. I can’t remember the exact date.

‘I cared for Maria for seven months but I had to come back to Bulgaria look after my other children.

‘I left my daughter with my room-mate. She is also Roma. When I left Maria I asked the woman to send  her to Bulgaria. But she hasn’t. I cannot remember her name, it was four years ago.

‘I missed Maria but I don’t have any 
money so I did not know what to do. I called the woman several times and
 I knew she was safe and well. I don’t know why she kept her so long, 
why they did not send her back to me.

‘I
 don’t have enough money to call the woman in Greece any more so I 
stopped trying to get in touch with her. I didn’t know what was 
happening with my child. But I have never stopped wanting her, she is my
 own flesh and blood.’

Mrs Ruseva and her husband registered the birth of a child four years ago at a hospital in Lamia, an hour from the Farsala camp where Maria was found.

Greek police think Maria may have been sold on by a baby-smuggling gang who offer newborns to childless couples for up to £22,000. It is believed that Maria was sold for a knockdown price because police were moving in on child smugglers in the area.
