What an ingenius way to put a very special smile on a cancer patient's face.

In its latest project, a cancer foundation based in Belgium has tried to get 20 people to experience the feeling of being 'carefree' after being diagnosed with the disease - and captured that moment on camera.

The idea was inspired by a patient who told the foundation, 'You know what I miss the most? Being carefree'.

So to make that happen, staff invited 20 patients to a photo studio for what they told them was a free makeover from a team of professional hair and makeup stylists.

Noella got a shock when she saw what the stylists had done to her - given her dreads

But there was a condition: They 
had to keep their eyes closed the entire time.

The stylists then got to work - giving them a completely outlandish look they would never have expected.

And when the 20 patients opened their eyes, a photographer captured their shock and surprise through a one-way mirror.

Some looked horrified at first, while others broke into laughter straight away. But all of them enjoyed it in the end.

The project, named If Only for a Second, was created by the Mimi Foundation, an organisation dedicated to 'the improvement of the quality of life of people affected by cancer'.

President and founder Myriam Ullens de Schooten said: 'Learning that one is struck by cancer is terrifying. Suddenly, life changes.

'An operation is always difficult and painful , the following treatments often long and hard. The impact of the disease is different for everyone but still has significant consequences on the patient's life and that of her environment.

Surprise: Jeannine opened her eyes to see this - a very pink makeover

'I've had difficult times. But I was lucky enough to be surrounded by all those who meant something to me.

'A nice wig and a caring beautician made me feel like I was still a full-fledged woman despite the obvious effects of the disease.

'The support of a psychologist helped me to stay strong throughout my fight.

'The attention from nurses and doctors, brightly decorated oncology centers have made the chemotherapy sessions less stressful.

'The testimonies of people in recovery showed me that I could win the fight and look at the future more positively.

'From that experience I adopted the belief that cancer must be attacked on all fronts, not just medically. And the desire to offer to all those who face this disease, the possibility to be supported , helped and comforted.

'For everyone to live through the cancer "better", to take on the challenge with greater confidence.'
