Carl Froch is close to sealing the dream Las Vegas fight with Julio Cesar Chavez Jnr that will complete his career bucket list.

The 37-year-old has given thought to retiring since his stunning stoppage of George Groves in May, not least because his hopes of boxing in the world’s fight capital had apparently died with Chavez’s reluctance to face him.

Those talks with the Mexican former world champion resumed at the weekend, however, and further significant discussions are scheduled for later this week.

Froch’s promoter Eddie Hearn told Sportsmail that the fight would likely mean Froch vacating his IBF super-middleweight world title, for which James DeGale is the mandatory challenger.

But he would then stake his WBA belt against Chavez for a multi-million payday in Vegas.

Froch said: ‘I’ve said before if I can’t fight in Vegas I’ll probably call it a day. It has to be big, and Chavez Jr is that man, and I have had a good chat with my promoter and we are making good progress with that fight and hopefully we’ll have an announcement soon.’

Hearn, who believes the fight would most likely happen in early 2015, added: ‘As we all know, anything can happen in boxing, but I am hopeful that a fight can be made with Chavez in Las Vegas.

‘Chavez’s situation with his promoters, Top Rank, is complicated, but one way or the other I believe this fight will now take place. 

'For Carl, it has always been his dream to fight in Vegas so it is a fight we will try hard to finalise.

‘It had seemingly died in the water, but I took a call from Top Rank on Saturday and they wanted to explore the possibilities further.

'I am now expecting to be on a conference call with Chavez’s representatives later this week where we will try to make more progress.’

If Froch vacates, DeGale will likely fight for the belt early in 2015, with Hearn considering a Wembley bout between Froch and DeGale next summer if they both emerge unscathed.
