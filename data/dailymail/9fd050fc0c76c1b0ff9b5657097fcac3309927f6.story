After Harry Redknapp's  scathing rant about Adel Taarabt being 'three stone overweight', the QPR midfielder hit back at his boss by saying the 67-year-old 'never takes a (training) session'.

On the subject of his weight, the Moroccan claimed: 'My heaviest at Milan was 86kg (13st 8lb), my lightest 84kg — now I’m 85kg.' 

But that's small change compared to some of these big boys...
