Booth's view of day three of the third Test between England and India at 
the Ageas Bowl, which saw James Anderson and Stuart Broad step up to the plate. 

KUMAR'S CAUGHT OUT EARLY

England were celebrating a rare moment when they nipped an innings from No 9 Bhuvneshwar Kumar in the bud. 

Caught via his pad by a lunging Gary 
Ballance for 19, Kumar had been dismissed for fewer than 50 for only the
 second time in five innings this series.

Thumbs up: Ian Bell leaves the field  after injuring his thumb attempting a catch during day three

... BUT IT'S THUMBS UP FOR BELL

Ian Bell, back in form since Monday’s elegant 167, caused a scare when he went for an X-ray after being hit on the left thumb while fielding in the slips in the morning.

But there was no break and with England insisting his injury was limited to ‘acute bruising’, Bell remained off the field for treatment.

PUJARA AND KOHLI DON'T LIVE UP TO EXPECTATIONS

The two Indian batsmen England feared most before the series started were Cheteshwar Pujara and Virat Kohli.

But their respective contributions yesterday of 24 and 39 meant the pair have managed just one half-century between them in this series from 10 innings.

Don't believe the hype! Cheteshwar Pujara and Virat Kohli have not lived up to their reputations

STOKES PUTS TOGETHER A ROYAL INNINGS

Durham all-rounder Ben Stokes was dropped for this Test because his batting had disintegrated, so the selectors will have noted with relief the 56-ball 50 he made against Kent in the 50-over Royal London Cup.

That’s an improvement on the 18 runs he had managed in his previous 10 innings for England in all formats, including six ducks.

COOK AND ANDERSON EQUAL RECORD DOUBLE ACT

When Jimmy Anderson had Kohli caught in the slips not long after lunch, it was the 22nd time Alastair Cook had clung on from his bowling.

That equalled the England record for a bowler/non-wicketkeeper combination, now shared with Sir Ian Botham and Bob Willis.

Double act: James Anderson (L) and Alistair Cook have equalled England's record for bowler/non-wicketkeeper combination

500 PARTNERSHIP FOR ANDERSON AND BROAD

Another partnership milestone was brought up by Anderson’s removal of Ravindra Jadeja — the 500th Test wicket claimed by him and Stuart Broad in Tests they have played together.

Only two pairings stand in front of them: West India’s Courtney Walsh and Curtly Ambrose took 762 between them and Pakistan’s Wasim Akram and Waqar Younis 559.
