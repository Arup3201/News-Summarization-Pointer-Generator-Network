Wearing a pretty dress and a smile on her face, 7-year-old Brooklyn stabbing victim Mikayla Capers made her first public appearance today at a meeting of Reverend Al Sharpton's National Action Network.

Capers spent weeks recovering in the hospital after the savage June 1 knife attack that killed her best friend, 6-year-oold Prince Joshua Avitto. 

Suspected killer Daniel St. Hubert pleaded not guilty last month to charges of murder, attempted murder, assault and weapons possession in connection with the elevator killing in an East New York public housing building.

All smiles: The little girl with scars on her chest beamed and said she is 'feeling good' during the meeting in Harlem

Addressing Sharpton’s supporters Saturday, a beaming Mikayla said she is 'feeling good,' the New York Post reported.

The brave little girl came to the community meeting with her great-grandmother sporting a pink and purple dress that revealed two scars on her chest - stark reminders of the violent attack two months ago.

The 7-year-old's family are in the process of moving to a new home so she could start the third grade in the fall in a safer environment. 

The Boulevard Houses apartment complex had no surveillance cameras to record the moment when police say Daniel St Hubert lunged at Mikayla and PJ as the two were riding the elevator down on their way to buy ice cream.

PJ's body was found inside the elevator, 
and Mikayla was found barely conscious with 16 knife wounds outside a
 nearby building.

Suspect: Daniel St Hubert, who had recently been released from prison on an attempted murder charge, was arrested in connection with the attack

St Hubert is also accused of stabbing 
to death Tanaya Grant-Copeland, 18, days before the elevator killing, 
which earned him the nickname the 'Brooklyn Ripper.’

Mikayla’s first public appearance came a day after the 27-year-old murder suspect was deemed mentally fit to stand trial.

The
 Brooklyn courtroom was filled with the victims' relatives and friends, 
who were upset to hear St Hubert's attorney say that he might pursue an 
insanity defense. 

‘That’s a bunch of bulls***! Your god*** client killed him!’ yelled PJ’s enraged mother, Aricka McClinton, according to The Post.

A week before the Grant-Copeland murder, 
the 27-year-old was released from prison, where he had served a five-year sentence for attempted murder and assault.

Court records show he was arrested in 
May 2009 after punching his mother in the face, choking her with an 
electrical cord and stealing her car. He pleaded guilty in July 2012. While serving his sentence, St Hubert was diagnosed with 
paranoid schizophrenia.

Police said St Hubert was a suspect in the stabbing of a homeless man on a Manhattan subway platform.

If convicted, St Hubert faces a maximum 50 years to life in prison.
