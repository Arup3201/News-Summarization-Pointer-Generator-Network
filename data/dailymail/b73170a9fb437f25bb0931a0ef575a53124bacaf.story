Country star Trace Adkins' estranged wife has set the scene for a bitter divorce by obtaining a restraining order preventing him from 'harassing, threatening or assaulting' her.

Rhonda Adkins, the mother of the singer's three young daughters, has obtained a wide-ranging temporary restraining order from a Tennessee court, in which neither she nor the singer are allowed to take their children outside the state and sell or borrow against marital property.

Rhonda filed for divorce in Tennessee after the couple officially separated on Monday - but now most definitely means business after it was today reported that Trace had fallen for actress Victoria Pratt.

It is over: Trace Adkins wife Rhonda, pictured here last year, filed for divorce on Wednesday

The National Enquirer claimed that Trace bragged to a friend that he cheated on Rhonda with nearly a dozen women during their 17-year marriage - even boasting he had had sex with two women in one day before going home to bed Rhonda.

The publication claimed Trace - who went to rehab for drinking - had fallen off the wagon more than a year ago.

It was also claimed that Trace had even told his wife he had fallen for curvaceous Canadian D-list actress Victoria Pratt, 43, who he met while filming The Virginian last spring.

The blonde actress tweeted from the set: 'Gave Trace Adkins a sponge bath at work today…” Pratt boasted on March 30. “I owe the universe big time! #best job ever.'

When filming wrapped and Trace, 52, went on to star on All Star Celebrity Apprentice, Victoria was his biggest fan, eagerly tweeting recaps of the show, with flirty jibes aimed at the singer.

Soon it seems, Rhonda may have become aware of their flirtation. 'My Old Lady just gave me a mean look,' he tweeted on April 21, Victoria replied: 'Bahaha!! You’re lucky that’s all she gave you!!!'

Rumors: Actress Victoria Pratt is said to have developed a friendship with country singer and her co-star Trace Adkins - leaving his wife Rhonda furious. Her husband, TJ Scott has denied she had a fling with Trace - and says they are 'happily married'

Flirty: Co-stars Trace Adkins and Victoria Pratt filmed The Virginian together and since then exchanged a series of tweets

Just five days later, Pratt was the country singer’s guest of honor at the Stage Coach music festival in Indio, Calif., where she watched from backstage.

After Victoria posted a happy pic from the sidelines, a fan asked if she and her friend were “groupies or groupies,” and Pratt responded, “Yes and yes.”

And when Trace won Celebrity Apprentice, she tweeted, “Congrats you handsome devil!” and he responded, “Thanks gorgeous! MWAH”. A source told the Enquirer this was the last straw for Rhonda, adding: 'Rhonda has put up with Trace's cheating and abuse for years, but now she knows everything he's done and she plans to use it to make him pay big time.'

Victoria is married to Hollywood director and photographer TJ Scott, 53, who, when asked if they were separated, told MailOnline: 'No, we are not separated - we are very much married.'

When asked if Victoria had been seeing Trace, TJ replied: 'No, that is not true, we are happily married.'

Despite Trace's very public
 struggles with alcohol recently, his wife did not state that as a reason 
for wanting a divorce but instead said she was seeking to end their 
marriage due to 'irreconcilable differences.'

Seeking support: The couple was married in 1997 and have three daughters together MacKenzie, Brianna, and Trinity, whom child support is now being sought for

The divorce was first reported by TMZ and the legal documents state the couple was married in 1997 and 
have three daughters together MacKenzie, Brianna, and Trinity.

The girls are aged 16, 12, and 9 and Rhonda has requested 'primary residential custody'.

The country singer's wide has asked the court to grant her child support and alimony.

Unusually, Rhonda has also asked to be named the sole beneficiary of Trace's life insurance policy, TMZ reports.

Rhonda is Trace's third wife and he shares two adult daughters with his second wife, Julie.

Julie
 and Trace divorced in much more dramatic circumstances after Julie 
shot The Celebrity Apprentice star in the chest during a domestic dispute.

Recently Trace has found himself in the headlines after he was involved in a drunken brawl in January.

Bad year: The country singer, pictured in Las Vegas in December 2012, entered rehab earlier this year

The Nashville resident was taking 
part in a Country Cruising cruise when he fell off the wagon after 12 
years of sobriety beating a man who works as a Trace Adkins 
impersonator.

At the time his rep said: 'Trace has entered a treatment facility after a setback in his battle with alcoholism.'

'As he faces these issues head-on, we ask that his family's privacy will be respected.'

The
 singer-actor was performing on an eight-day cruise from Miami via 
Jamaica, Grand Cayman and Mexico that kicked off January 12.

Trace then checked himself out of rehab in February to be with his father Aaron Adkins when he passed away aged 71.
