Cesc Fabregas believes Chelsea have the 'talent, discipline and courage' to clinch an historic quadruple under Jose Mourinho this season.

The Blues are currently on course in all competitions, most recently defeating Derby 3-1 to advance to the semi-finals of the Capital One Cup.

And when asked by Sky Sports after the game at the iPro Stadium whether Chelsea could lift all four trophies, Fabregas insisted he had seen enough from his new side to suggest it is on.

'I'm enjoying playing in this team; we have a very strong squad and we want to go for everything,' the former Arsenal midfielder said. 

'We can get better, 100 per cent, and we know that. Everyone is really focused and professional but the next two or three weeks are very important.

'Time will tell [how good this season can be]. We definitely have the talent, the discipline and the courage to do it, I'm sure of that from what I've seen so far in my short time here.

'I can see the team doing well but we will have to work hard and, at the end of the season, we will talk about it.' 

Jose Mourinho's side have been in fine form in all competitions but he is wary of talk about a quadruple

That goes against the thoughts of Fabregas' manager Mourinho, who when asked whether the quadruple was a possibility replied: 'You (the media) spoke a few weeks ago about being unbeatable in the Premier League - we never did it.

'Now you speak about a quadruple but we must keep our feet on the ground.' 

Fabregas was also pictured running on to the field with Cesar Azpilicueta holding a stretcher during the game on Tuesday night after Kurt Zouma was injured in a collision.

Mourinho said that the young defender 'should be fine', despite the apparent severity of the knock following a collision with his own goalkeeper, Petr Cech.
