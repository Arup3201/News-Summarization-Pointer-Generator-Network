Casey Kasem's wife ignored medical advice and disconnected her husband's feeding tube when she removed him from a California nursing home, staff have claimed.

The allegations are made in a statement Kasem's doctor made after Jean Kasem took her 82-year-old husband from the care home at 2.30am last month.

He highlighted in the letter that the feeding tube was the only way the American Top 40 host could be fed or hydrated, and claimed Ms Kasem was warned of the risks.

Nursing staff at the home also gave statements claiming they had refused to agree to releasing their patient, and alleged that Ms Kasem left without signing a form showing she was removing him 'against medical advice'.

The details were revealed in the Daily News in documents handed to elder abuse investigators at Santa Monica Police.

According to Dr Paul Leitner, who cared for Kasem before he was removed from the facility, Ms Kasem 'disconnected his G-tube, which provided his only source to nutrition and hydration'.

The doctor added: 'She was informed of the risks of doing so and was told she was placing Mr  Kasem in great bodily harm or possible demise.'

Registered nurse Jennifer Kusiappiah also made a statement claiming Kasem's wife removed him 'even though I have clearly explained that it was dangerous and could be fatal'.

She added that Ms Kasem was concerned about the radio host's privacy after he was visited by his two daughters.

Critical condition: Radio host Kasem, center, has developed sepsis from an infected bedsore

Private investigator Logan Clarke claimed that Ms Kasem should be charged with elder abuse, and told the Daily News she had allegedly removed hospital equipment used to keep her husband alive.

After a protracted family battle between Kasem's wife and his adult children from a previous marriage, the radio host was removed from life support machines on Wednesday.

His daughters had been frantically searching for him since Ms Kasem removed him from the care home. He was later found in a Seattle property belonging to friends of his wife.

At this point, Kasem had developed sepsis from infected bedsores, and was taken to a Washington hospital, where doctors and a lawyer for his daughter, Kerri, say he is dying.

After Kerri Kasem was given a court order that allowed her to return her father to hospital, he was taken off life support. As well as the sepsis infection, he has dementia and Parkinson's.

A judge ruled Wednesday that Kasem's doctors should stop force-feeding the dying broadcast legend and allow him to slip away - despite the legal and emotional objections of his wife, who declared 'You have blood on your hands!'

Kerri Kasem has filed a police report alleging that her step-mother's decision to 
remove Casey from the nursing home last month 
were criminal,  TMZ.com reported.

Update: In a Facebook post Kerri Kasem announced that her father had been removed from life support

TMZ reported that Kerri Kasem claimed to have medical documents that showed the bed sore would likely contribute to Kasem's death.

She posted on her Facebook page that her father was dying in hospital.

'Transitioning our father’s treatment to comfort-oriented care was one of the hardest decisions we’ve ever had to make,' she wrote.

'For the last 11 days, our father has been surrounded day and night by love and care by his daughters Kerri and Julie, his son Mike, his brother Mouner and sister-in-law Mary, and his dear friend Gonzalo Venecia,' she added.
