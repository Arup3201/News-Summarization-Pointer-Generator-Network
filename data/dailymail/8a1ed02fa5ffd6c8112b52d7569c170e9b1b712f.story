A sales director offered two female executives free shopping sprees in Harrods if they agreed to his demands for a threesome, a tribunal heard yesterday.

Married Darren Scott allegedly pestered Anna Mazover, 29, and Diana Nicholl-Pierson, 24, for sex and promised to shower them  with expensive gifts, oysters  and champagne.

He also said they would be promoted if they agreed to return with him to his £1.4 million penthouse apartment  in London.

The women claim they were sacked after refusing the 55-year-old’s ‘non-stop’ sexual advances.

Claims: Anna Mazover, 29, (right) and Diana Nicholl-Pierson, 24, (left) told Central London Employment Tribunal they were offered promotions in return for sex with their boss, but were dismissed when they refused

Harassment: The women (left) claim Darren Scott, 55, (right) subjected them to persistent sexual remarks during the single month they worked for him at publishing firm Entico

Giving evidence at the Central London employment tribunal, Miss Mazover said: ‘It started on my first day, it was every day.

‘I
 cannot tell you how many times a day he made some sort of remark. On my
 first day, he said “you have a sexy body, you’re are very tall and 
slim” and he said “have you ever thought about working in a strip club”.
 He would talk about my breasts and body. It was non-stop. I thought it 
was very shocking and outrageous.’

Mr
 Scott’s representative, Adam Gadd, dismissed the claims as  ‘complete 
fantasy’, claiming Miss Mazover was dismissed from her job at 
London-based publishing firm Entico Corporation for lateness and poor 
performance.

But Miss 
Mazover said: ‘He harassed me and asked me to come to his penthouse to 
have oysters and champagne with him. (He) then said, “I will buy you 
everything that you want in Harrods or Selfridges”.’

Miss
 Mazover, the daughter of a Ukrainian businessman, also claims racial 
discrimination. She said Mr Scott mocked her accent and made derogatory 
comments about Russian women, implying they were easy, and one day 
greeted her with, ‘Good morning, Red Army’.

Sex: Anna Mazover (left) claims Darren Scott fired her when she refused to have a threesome with him and her then co-worker Diana Nicholl-Pierson (right)

Statements
 submitted to the tribunal also reveal that Miss Nicholl-Pierson 
reported Mr Scott to the police after he allegedly sexually assaulted 
her by touching her thighs and bottom.

Police investigated the claim but no further action was taken.

Both
 women, who are seeking £108,000 in damages between them, claim that on 
May 21 last year they were at an office party when Mr Scott invited them
 to his penthouse for a threesome.

Miss
 Mazover, a former professional synchronised swimmer, said: ‘He said to 
both of us: “It would be nice if we go back together to my penthouse and
 have a threesome”.’

On June 14 last year, Entico's director James Ramsey (left) called both women into his office and allegedly told them 'there were no grounds for the complaints'. Darren Scott (right) fired them shortly afterwards, they claim

Allegations: Miss Mazover, who is from Ukraine, claims she was the victim of racial discrimination. Mr Scott mocked her accent and made remarks on the reputation of 'Russian women', she says

Both 
women complained to the company’s human resources department, but they 
say that on June 14, Entico director James Ramsey called them into his 
office and told them ‘there were no grounds for the complaints’.

Shortly afterwards, they were both dismissed with no explanation, it is claimed.

The
 women are bringing the claims against Scott, Entico Corporation and Mr 
Ramsey on the grounds of sexual harassment, victimisation, race 
discrimination and public interest disclosure.

Miss Mazover is claiming £41,000, while Miss Nicholl-Pierson is claiming £67,000.

Mr Scott denies all the allegations.

 The hearing continues.
