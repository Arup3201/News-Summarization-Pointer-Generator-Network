A pool is an added bonus for most hotel stays - but for some luxury resorts, it's the star attraction.

Now a luxury travel company has revealed the world's most breathtaking poolside views - from a private infinity pool overlooking the Amalfi coast in Italy, to one with a 360 degree view on top of a cliff in Phuket, Thailand.

Private spot: Each suite at the Ladera resort in St Lucia features a private plunge pool

Travel company Luxury Link scoured the globe to find the best vistas visible from the comfort of a pool and narrowed the shortlist down to just four destinations: St Lucia, Italy, Thailand and Greece.

At the Ladera resort in St Lucia, holidaymakers can take a dip in a swimming pool perched on top of a cliff 1,100 feet above the Caribbean sea, nestled between a volcano and mountain range.

Each suite 
features an 'open wall' with a private plunge pool so visitors can take in the breathtaking
views without having to jostle for space with their fellow guests.

Some even feature a two-person swing or a 'cascading waterfall'.

In Italy, the boutique Laqua hotel and spa in Sorrento has been designed according to the principles of Feng Shui.

Each of its six suites comes with an infinity pool, which blends the view between the 
hotel and the stunning Amalfi coast.

And at the Saint John 
Mykonos hotel in Greece, guests taking a dip in its large infinity pool can gaze out over the Mediterranean Sea which laps onto 
the resort’s private beach on the bay of Agios Ioannis.

The hotel's location - Mykonos island - provided the setting for the film Shirley Valentine.

Meanwhile, the Paresa resort in Phuket, Thailand is perched high on a cliff-top and its secluded pool boasts 360 degree views of the surrounding lush Banyan tree forest, along with the Andaman Sea.

The pool comes to life at night thanks to special fibre-optic lighting which makes it look as though it is studded with stars.

But these views don't come cheap and guests will have to splash out to afford the best rooms.

Four-night stays at the hotels range from £723 at Laqua in Sorrento up to £2,298 for a Hilltop Dream Suite at the Ladera resort in St Lucia.
