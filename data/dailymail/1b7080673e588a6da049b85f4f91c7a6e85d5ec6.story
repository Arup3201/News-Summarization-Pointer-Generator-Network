A tube of Pringles similar to the tin a Mumsnet user found in her son's bedroom filled with urine 

Messy teenage boys' bedrooms... they're the stuff nightmares are made of. 

But a mother on the parenting website Mumsnet has now clarified just how gruesome it can get when clearly out the room of an adolescent, after discovering a Pringles tube full of urine.

The mum, who goes by the username 'myotherusernameisbetter' revealed she made the discovering while cleaning out her son's room this weekend. 

She wrote: 'Today [my second son] (13) was away for the day and I was waiting on hospital visiting time as my Mum is very unwell, I needed something to keep me occupied so I decided to do [his] room as a treat. 

'Apart from the dirty laundry I found: 2 empty juice bottles, 1 empty smoothie carton, 1 empty milk shake carton, 6 empty crisp packets, 3 apple cores, a pile of orange peel, a pile of sweet wrappers, some bits of popcorn, 2 plastic bowls, 2 plastic cups......and a Pringle tube full of urine.

'We are going to have to have a talk when he gets home.

The lid was on - I reached out to pick it up expecting it to be light.....it was heavy, and full of liquid - i opened and sniffed.

'It's just as well he keeps his windows open and heating off.' 

The revelation caused some shock to other users on the forum, with some saying that they would be serious consequences for such behaviour in their households. 

But other mothers, often of teenage boys, were sympathetic, with many sharing their own horror stories of items left to rot in their children's bedrooms. 

One user called SoupDragonwrite: 'I did [my son's room] whilst he was away over half term. 

'I filled 4 kerbside recycling crates with paper, 2 with bottles and cans, 3/4 of the landfill bin and did approximately 47 billion loads of laundry which mostly consisted of odd socks.

'I was a little surprised not to find a dead rat.'

Another called BellMcEnd said: 'I mucked out [my eight-year-old son's] bed today. 

'Under his pillow I found: 4 books, 52p, a medal from sports day, a weird piece of felt he'd been doing something with at school for art, a lego man and a lip salve.

'I only changed it ten days ago.'

One disgruntled mother is so fed up with her son's untidy habits that she has given up attempting to tidy his room. 

Faithope said: 'My [son] is 16 and a slob when it comes to his room. 

'Dirty pants and clothes continue to lay on the floor- the pile of clean and ironed clothes are piling up as I just add to it. T

'The fact that [my son] thinks he has run out of clean pants and has helped himself to his dad's so he has a pair to wear...if only he looked in that lovely pile of laundry on his bedroom floor, he would find the 20 pairs that are clean and ready to wear.'

The Mumsnet discussion about disgusting items found in teenagers' bedrooms 

The forum debate took on a similar tone to a conversation on the site in 2012, when one user asked  a question about a 'penis beaker' that almost crashed the site. 

The person, called SaraCrewe, wrote: 'We have a dedicated post-sex cleanup area on the bedside table. 

'A box of tissues, a small bin, and a beaker of clean water for temporary cleaning/dunking while the bathroom is occupied by me.

'Apparently our penis beaker is strange and not the done thing.'

It was met with more than a thousand comments from mumsnet users who called the beaker 'disgusting.'
