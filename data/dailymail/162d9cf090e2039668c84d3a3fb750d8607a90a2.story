A coroner is investigating the role of the violent video game Call of Duty in the deaths of up to four teenage boys who played it before killing themselves.

John Pollard said that in ‘three or four inquests . . . the Call of Duty game seems to be figuring in recent activity before death’.

He added: ‘It concerns me greatly. It has figured in a number of deaths which I’m investigating.’

Concerns: Speaking at the inquest into the death of schoolboy William Menzies, left coroner John Pollard said he was worried that Call of Duty had featured in this and other inquests, including that of Callum Green, right

Warning: Call of Duty (the screengrab is from CoD 4) is one of the world's most successful titles, but the coroner has warned parents not to allow their children to play adult-only titles like this one

He was speaking at the inquest of 
gifted A-level student William Menzies, 16, who suffocated himself in 
his bedroom, where he frequently played the war-simulation game on an 
Xbox.

Like other violent games such as Grand
 Theft Auto, many releases in the Call of Duty series have an 18 
certificate but are often played by school-age boys.

Expert: Coroner John Pollard, who presided over the inquests into the deaths of Harold Shipman's victims, says the mention of the game 'concerned him greatly'

In February 2012, Callum Green, 14, 
was found hanged after playing Call of Duty with his stepfather.

At the 
time, Mr Pollard urged parents to stop their children playing adult 
video games, saying the age restriction was for a ‘valid reason’.

The South Manchester coroner said Call of Duty had also been linked to the deaths of two other unnamed teenagers.

William lived with his parents John, 
56, and Anne, 52, and older brother Alexander, 19, in the upmarket 
village of Hale, Greater Manchester, and attended Altrincham Grammar 
School.

Mr Menzies said: ‘Nothing about him 
caused concern.

'He was very taken with his studies and he enjoyed 
playing his Xbox.

'The game he always played was Call of Duty.

‘He was rather self-contained, he didn’t like going out a great deal.

'He didn’t drink or smoke – he was the opposite to that.

‘He had exams coming up, but that 
wouldn’t cause him any worry as he was a straight-A student.

'He never 
threatened self-harm to my knowledge.’

Mr Menzies told the inquest that on 
February 17, during the half-term holidays, he was working at home and 
gave his son the science fiction novel Never Let Me Go to read.

Scary: Call of Duty has an 18 certificate and is one of the gorier video games on the market

Call of Duty allows players to inhabit the role of a blood-thirsty soldier in a variety of grusome scenarios.

Gamers are armed with machine guns, rifles, pistols and grenades and play a fast-paced game of kill or be killed.

Norwegian mass killer Anders Breivik claimed he had ‘trained himself’ to kill his 77 victims by playing Call of Duty.

French terrorist Mohammed Merah also played Call Of Duty before killing three soldiers and four civilians – including a rabbi and three children – in Toulouse in March 2012.

The violence in Call of Duty has been criticised by the London Jewish Forum, the British Muslim Forum and Church of England ministers. Call of Duty 3 shows soldiers running through London while bombs explode and buildings crash to the ground.

In one controversial scene a soldier causes a Tube train to derail and explode. Other graphic scenes show aerial attacks on New York and grenades exploding in Paris and Berlin.

When news of the Certificate 18 game's content was revealed it was panned by Mediawatch UK as being in 'incredibly poor taste'.

Call of Duty 2 also caused outrage when it was revealed players could kill 'civilians'. There are currently at least 40million active players across all of the Call of Duty titles.

‘On one occasion I heard William laughing in his bedroom,’ he said.

His wife sounded the alert later that afternoon when she went to check on their son, and the family tried to resuscitate him.

An ambulance came to the family’s home within ten minutes and rushed him to hospital, but he was later pronounced dead.

Mr Menzies said: ‘I would say William 
is a person who made his own mind up and carried things out, so . . . I 
would say that there is clear suggestion he intended it.

‘He was happy that day and the last 
thing I heard him do was laugh, so I could only guess as to why he might
 have done it, but there is no doubt he intended to take his life.’

William’s brother Alexander said: ‘I 
remember him saying he had admiration for a philosopher who had decided 
to kill himself.

'He never said he was going to harm himself. During that
 day, at lunchtime, the two of us were making lunch together. He seemed 
cheery and in a good mood.’

Recording a verdict of suicide, Mr 
Pollard said: ‘I suspect, but I don’t know because I don’t have enough 
evidence, that William may have been experimenting with something or 
deliberately intending.

‘There is no doubt it was asphyxia. There was no note or indication he was feeling down or distressed.’

Mr Pollard recorded an open verdict at
 the inquest into the death of Callum, who was found hanged in his 
bedroom after being grounded by his mother following a row.

Coroners investigate violent or 
unnatural deaths, or those with an  unknown cause.

In some cases, a 
death may be referred to police for investigation on behalf of a 
coroner, or to an independent body such as the Health and Safety 
Executive.
