Northampton winger George North is to see a specialist next week after being knocked out in the Saints' Aviva Premiership clash with Wasps on Friday.

North scored two tries in Northampton's 52-30 win but after the second he was caught on the head by the knee of Wasps forward Nathan Hughes, who was sent off for dangerous play but protested his innocence.

Wales international North left the field unconscious and in a neck brace but the club tweeted just before half-time that he was 'awake' and the player wrote on his own Twitter account on Saturday: 'Thanks for all the messages. Feeling ok, up and about.'

A subsequent statement from Northampton read: 'After the game North was conscious and in the Saints' changing room with the rest of the team.

'He has been into the club today (Saturday) for treatment and will continue to be monitored by the Saints' experienced medical team throughout the weekend.

'As with everyone in the squad, Northampton Saints places the highest importance on player welfare, and as such North will see a specialist early next week for an assessment.'

The injury was a worrying sight after North took two blows to the head in Wales' RBS 6 Nations defeat against England last month.

He controversially played on in that game before sitting out Wales' next match against Scotland.

Northampton director of rugby Jim Mallinder said after Friday's game: 'He is okay now; he is up and walking about in the dressing room. It is a knock to his head, which is not good.

'We will look after him and make sure he comes back when he is right.'
