Fashion heiress Margherita Missoni is pregnant with her second child with husband Eugenio Amos.

The 31-year-old Italian, who gave birth to her first child, a son, Otto, in September last year, shared a picture of her growing baby bump on Instagram on Christmas Day, hinting to her 70,000 followers that she is expecting another boy.

'In case you had any doubt #MerryChristmas #mumsofboys #dressfortheoccasion,' she commented alongside the snap, which was taken at her family home in Varese, Italy.

While Margherita has not yet revealed when baby number two is due, her baby bump already looks fairly sizable, suggesting she is a fair few months into her pregnancy. 

The model, who married racing driver Eugenio in June 2012, shared a second snap of her bump later on Christmas Day, this time while wearing a festive glittery dress, this time captioning the picture with a series of suitable hashtags: '#weargoldforChristmas #bellyseries #festiveattire #dressfortheoccasion'

During her first pregnancy, the keen Instagram user regularly documented her growing baby bump -and she has continued to share numerous pictures of one-year-old Otto since his birth. 

The happy news of Margherita's pregnancy comes less than two years after her uncle, Vittorio Missoni, and his wife Maurizia Castiglioni, died in a tragic plane accident.

The plane, which went missing on January 4, 2013, in Venezuela, and the bodies of its passengers, were only recovered after an extensive six month search, during which time the Missoni family suffered another devastating loss when Margherita's grandfather Ottavio Missoni passed away.

At the time, Margherita spoke out about how the news had affected her pregnancy - and she paid tribute to her family's unwavering strength, which she credited with helping her to cope with the tragedy.  

'Of course, it was especially hard for me because I'm pregnant,' she told The Times in a profile published in August last year.

'I've had a very intense pregnancy, with all the things that have happened, but it wasn't my father; other family members have had a harder time.

'It has helped that there are so many of us and we are so tight. It's easier than if I were having to face it all on my own.'
