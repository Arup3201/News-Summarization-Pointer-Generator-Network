The man who sparked a massive rescue effort when he fell between a train and platform has revealed he had no idea how many people actually chipped in to help until he saw the photos.

The passenger, only known as Andy, was freed by dozens of commuters when he slipped and became wedged between a train and the platform at a Perth railway station at 8.50am on Wednesday.

Andy miraculously managed to walk away unscathed and boarded a train at 9.30am. He was believed to be heading to work when the incident unfolded.

'Once I saw it I thought wow, that's a pretty cool photo. That's when I realised how big an effort it took to get me out,' Andy told Nine News.

'I was feeling a little bit of shock. I was sort of wobbly on my feet, it took me a while to sort of get my balance.

'It's something I'll be telling my grandchildren about.'

He was boarding a Perth-bound train at Stirling Station when he slipped and one leg became wedged in the gap

Quick-thinking passengers and staff pushed the 90-tonne train to help free his leg 

Andy was boarding a rush hour train at Stirling station, north-west of Perth, when he slipped and one leg became trapped.

Quick-thinking passengers and staff helped rock the 90-tonne train to help free his leg.

'My left leg missed the train and fell down the platform, right down past my knee, up to my thigh,' he said.

'I just got caught up in the rush somehow getting on the train, stepped through the gap instead of on to the train.

'They couldn't get my knee past the platform (despite) twisting and turning.

'In the end, all the passengers lined up along the platform and tilted the train just far enough for me to be pulled out of the gap.'

He was treated by paramedics, but he did not sustain any serious injuries.

'I didn't realise how many people were witnessing this situation until I saw the footage later on the news,' he said.

'I was amazed. I had no idea it was that big of an incident, that it took that many people to free me.'

'I was feeling a little bit of shock. I was sort of wobbly on my feet, it took me a while to sort of get my balance,' he told Nine News

Transperth spokesman David Hynes told the  ABC they were quick to alert the driver to ensure the train didn't move.

'Then our staff who were there at the time got the passengers, and there were lots of them, off the train, and organised them to sort of rock, tilt the train backwards away from the platform so they were able to get him out and rescue him,' he said.  

Mr Hynes said it was not a problem caused by overcrowding and praised the actions of staff and passengers who helped free the man.

'Everyone sort of pitched in. It was people power that saved someone from possibly quite serious injury,' he said.

Nicolas Taylor told Perth Now that he and fellow passengers got off the train and worked together to free the man by pushing against the carriage away from the platform.

'He seemed to be a bit sheepish, because right where he fell was the ‘mind the gap’ writing,' he said.

Mr Taylor said Transperth staff coordinated the incident well, taking about 10 minutes to free him.

'They did a really good job, they took control and handled it well. When I first saw it I thought we’d be there for hours.' he said.
