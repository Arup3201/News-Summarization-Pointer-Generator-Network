A 20-year-old Florida burglary suspect was polite and remorseful when caught ransacking a woman's home in Palm Bay late last month.

On December 22, the homeowner called 911 to report that a man broke into her apartment.

'I walk into my room, and I find all my boyfriend's shoes and clothes thrown on the floor. I said, "So you're trying to rob us?" And he's like, he nodded his head,' the woman told the emergency dispatcher.

Courteous criminal: Johnathan Johnson, 20, has been arrested and charged with unarmed burglary of occupied dwelling and third-degree grand larceny, despite apologizing to his victim and returning all the stolen possessions and money  

The homeowner told police the thief, identified as Johnathan Aqueel Johnson, of Palm Bay, explained to her that he needed money to buy Christmas presents for his son.

The well-mannered 20-year-old climbed into the apartment by breaking a window screen, which he later fixed, reported the station WESH-TV.

The homeowner then noticed that she was missing $260 in cash and confronted the intruder about the stolen funds

‘I asked him, “Where's my money?” And he's like, “I forgot to give it to you,”’ she said.

Johnson ended up slinking away empty handed after returning all the stolen possessions and cash to their rightful owner.

Caught red-handed: A woman living in this Palm Bay, Florida, apartment building returned home to find Johnson ransacking her possessions 

The woman told police she had seen Johnson before but was not acquainted with him.

Unfortunately for Johnson, neither the homeowner nor police were impressed with the 20-year-old's courtesy and contrite demeanor.

The Palm Bay man has been arrested and charged with unarmed burglary of occupied dwelling and third-degree grand larceny.
