A boy who was left blind in one eye after years of neglect by his mother and her partner was so desperate he once scrawled ‘help me’ on a wall at home.

But despite the vulnerable child’s plea, the authorities repeatedly missed opportunities to intervene.

The 12-year-old was left in squalor with his baby sister while his mother, who lives on benefits, and her boyfriend were ‘too busy’ to notice his failing health. 

Social workers and police found squalid conditions in the family's home and the boy had written 'save me' on one wall in an apparent cry for help

Gillian Hendry and Craig Dick were jailed last month for neglect after Hendry's son went blind in one eye

Gillian Hendry and Craig Dick, both 34, were jailed for child cruelty last month for allowing the children to live in appalling, fly-infested conditions.

But a report has revealed that the wretchedness of the youngsters’ lives had been flagged up on numerous occasions by school staff and health workers as far back as 2007 – and was not acted on.

The pair were finally removed from their home in Thornaby, Teesside, last year, when a social worker noticed the words ‘help me’ written on a wall outside the boy’s bedroom. 

Hendry admitted to a social worker that her son had written the message when officials first paid a visit to the property.

The unnamed boy developed a cataract in one eye after his parents failed to take him to hospital appointments that could have saved his sight.

He had also been walking with a limp after developing arthritis from living in the filthy and mouldy property, and was forced to look after his two-year-old sister. 

The report into the case stated that worries were first raised about the boy, now 12, when he was six years old

The report, compiled by a social worker tasked with investigating the case, revealed that a series of chances to help the children were missed. 

Issues about the boy’s cleanliness and attendance were first raised in 2007 by his primary school, but social services decided not to intervene. 

Hospital consultant Dr Fiona Clark warned in 2009 that the boy’s failure to attend appointments could leave him permanently disabled but social services again failed to visit.

They finally acted when a school nurse went to the property in 2010 and found the child in a mouse-infested home with no heating or hot water. 

But a subsequent visit by council staff determined that conditions had significantly improved and the case was closed.

Fears were raised by Dr Clark again after the child moved to a different property in September 2011. But when school staff said they had no further concerns, welfare officers decided not to carry out an assessment.

Following yet another warning from the consultant, social workers visited the home eight months later – but declared it acceptable without even looking at the children’s rooms.

It was not until the intervention of a GP last year that officials grasped the full horror of the child’s health problems.

A serious case review has already been launched by the Stockton Local Safeguarding Children Board to look at the incident. 

Alex Cunningham, Labour MP for Stockton North, said: ‘This has been a tragic situation for this young boy and it is clear that there needs to be a full and detailed inquiry into why he was let down.’

Middlesbrough Council said the case was closed following improvements in the child’s home life and school attendance.
