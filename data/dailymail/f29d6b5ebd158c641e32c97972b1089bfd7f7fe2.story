The parents of a toddler with spinal bifida are outraged after TSA officials forced their daughter to undergo a series of additional security measures ahead of their flight to Disney World.

Nathan and Annie Forck were flying out of their home state of Missouri on a February 8 flight bound for Orlando, Florida with their wheelchair-bound daughter Lucy and their two other children.

Mrs Forck took a six-minute video detailing their toddler’s cries as she said through tears that she didn’t want to go to Disney World anymore, and is claiming the TSA discriminates against people who use mobility devices.

Trail of tears: Lucy, pictured bottom, was in tears after a TSA agent subjected the three-year-old girl to a full patdown; the TSA later issued an apology

Upset: Throughout the patdown, the little girl was weeping and saying: 'i don't want to go to Disney World.' The family was flying to Orlando from their home in Missouri

As Fox News Radio reports, the Forcks were attempting to fly to Orlando to enjoy a family vacation at Disney World and were flying out of Lambert-St Louis International Airport.

Though they got through the TSA security checkpoint without incident, a TSA agent pulled the family aside to screen Lucy’s wheelchair further for a pat down and swabbing her mobility device.

Mrs Forck pulled out her smart phone and began recording the whole event, against the TSA agent’s request.

‘It’s illegal to do that,’ the female agent is heard saying.

Mrs Forcks responds: ‘You can’t touch my daughter unless I can record it,’ and later adds: ‘The problem is, I don’t allow anyone to touch my little daughter.’

Throughout the argument between the mother and the TSA agent, Lucy can be heard crying, apparently confused at what exactly was going on. 

Her stuffed animal, ‘Lamby,’ had been scanned via X-ray and had not been returned to her.

Know your rights: Mother Annie Forck filmed the entire patdown and said she had the right to film it, despite the TSA agent's protest

At one point Lucy's beloved stuffed animal Lamby was taken from her as well

Mr Forck, an attorney, told Fox News 
that he knew it was legal to record the event and said that if the same 
instance had occurred outside the setting of an airport, it would be 
illegal.

‘But you put a TSA badge on and now all of a sudden, it’s okay,’ he told the station. The father added that he and his wife were not trying to make a scene, but instead were looking out for the well-being of their daughter.

The TSA later admitted its agents should never have threatened to patdown the little girl and apologized to the family.

'While no pat-down was performed, we will address specific concerns with our workforce,' a spokeswoman told MailOnline.

According to the TSA website, ‘passengers who can neither stand nor walk will be screened by a thorough patdown while they remain seated.’

The site adds: ‘A patdown procedure is used to resolve any alarms of a metal detector or anomalies identified by imaging technology.’

Checkpoint: The TSA states on its website that those in wheelchairs and scooters who cannot walk must go through a comprehensive patdown

The government agency offers a notification card for those with medical issues, but it is clearly stated on the card that presenting it to agents doesn’t exempt passengers from screening.

Mr Forck told Fox News that Lucy had no problem coming through Orlando’s TSA checkpoint. 

The Transportation Security Administration was formed in early 2002 following the terrorist attacks on the World Trade Center and Pentagon.
