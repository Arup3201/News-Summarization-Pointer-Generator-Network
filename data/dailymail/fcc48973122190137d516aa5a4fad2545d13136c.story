They say beauty is in the eye of the beholder, but according to a new study, there is a perfect woman - and she's not too far removed from the Duchess of Cambridge.

A dating site gathered user data from approximately 22,000 of its male members to determine what British men deem to be the 'perfect' woman.

This was based not only on physical attributes such as hair color, eye colour and body type, but also on traits such as smoking and drinking habits, as well as education level.

A new study has looked into how British men would define the 'perfect woman' - and she's not too far removed from the Duchess of Cambridge

The study found that this woman is, physically, someone who has dark brown hair, green eyes and a slender body type.

In terms of her habits, the research revealed that she doesn't smoke and is a social drinker with a graduate degree.

The epitome of style and grace is, it seems, a near perfect match with the Duchess of Cambridge.

The glossy brunette royal, who has an athletic build and hazel eyes was also educated at University, where she met Prince William.

The study found that this woman is, physically, someone who has dark brown hair, green eyes and a slender body type - just like Kate, pictured, left, last summer and, right, a few weeks ago whilst pregnant 

Kate, 33, also doesn't smoke and is rarely seen drinking. 

'The Perfect Woman must possess both style and substance,' said a spokesperson for WhatsYourPrice.com, who commissioned the research.

'The study confirms that men are interested just as much in a woman’s intellect and education as her physical qualities.'
