Birthday boy Rafael Nadal hit back from a set down to turn his quarter-final against David Ferrer around completely and keep his hopes for a record ninth French Open title alive.

On the day after he turned 28, Nadal was slow to come out of the blocks and deservedly lost his first set at Roland Garros this year as Ferrer nudged in front.

Almost every facet of Nadal's game was below par at that point, but he awoke from his slumber and struck back in blistering fashion to win 4-6, 6-4, 6-0, 6-1.

In the 
early stages Ferrer's impressive shot variation caused problems for 
Nadal, but he used the anger from losing the opening set to fuel a 
complete turnaround.

Nadal will face Andy Murray in the semi-finals after the Wimbledon champion's win over home favourite Gael Monfils.

The
 world number one made 12 unforced errors in the first seven games, to 
Ferrer's five, and that made it all too easy for his compatriot to gain a
 foothold in the contest.

Ferrer,
 who hit 13 winners in the opening set and had plenty of joy from forays
 to the net, broke Nadal early on before the Spaniard responded 
immediately.

At
 that point many would have expected Nadal to kick on, but he continued 
to struggle before Ferrer made him pay by claiming the first of two 
break points to clinch the set.

Last
 time the two met Ferrer beat Nadal in straight sets at the 
quarter-final stage of the ATP World Tour Masters 1000 Monte Carlo, so 
it was not too much of a surprise that he was proving such a tricky 
customer.

But in the second set Nadal came out with renewed purpose and never looked back.

His
 frustrations were epitomised by a furious smash close to the net to set
 up a break point in the third game, which he duly converted with a 
pin-point backhand down the line.

Nadal's
 trademark pace and power began to give Ferrer the run-around but he 
still had opportunities and let a break point slip at 3-2.

Nadal was ruthless in clinching the second set, serving the final game out to love to tie the match.That
 mean streak carried over into the third set as Ferrer began to buckle 
under the sheer ferocity of Nadal, who raced into a 5-0 lead to serve 
for the set.

With
 the world number one now finding top form he made no mistakes, with no 
unforced errors throughout the third set, once more holding serve to 
love to take the lead.

Ferrer
 had started to look like a broken man at that point, going 3-0 down in 
the fourth set, before crafting two break points to give himself a 
glimmer of hope.

After
 letting one slip he made no mistake to end an 11-game losing streak, 
but Nadal broke back immediately and then won the next two games to win 
the match at a canter.
