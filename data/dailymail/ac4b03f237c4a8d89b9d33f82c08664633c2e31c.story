The murder weapon used to shoot BBC presenter Jill Dando was used again in a gangland execution in Liverpool years later, a former police officer has claimed.

Miss Dando, 37, was gunned down outside her home in Fulham, west London, on April 26, 1999, moments after stepping out of her car.

A former officer, who did not wish to be
 named, today claimed that a link has been discovered between Dando's 
killing and a shooting in Liverpool's docklands several years later.

However a source with close knowledge of the Dando murder investigation described the latest claims as ‘complete nonsense’.

Murdered: Jill Dando, pictured left, was killed outside her home in Fulham in 1999. Barry George was jailed for her murder in 2001 but freed in 2008 following the emergence of fresh evidence

‘There is no truth in the suggestion the murder weapon was used again in Liverpool,’ he said.

‘The most likely scenario is that the gun was thrown into the Thames shortly after Miss Dando was shot dead.

‘Sadly police divers were never able to recover it.’

Dando was killed with a single muffled bullet to the skull and neighbours found her in a pool of blood on her doorstep in a crime that shocked Britain.

Part-time stuntman Barry George was jailed for the killing in 2001, but his conviction was overturned in August 2008 following the emergence of fresh evidence.

The 53-year-old has since attempted to claim compensation from the Metropolitan Police and her killer remains at large.

The suggestion by the police officer that the murder weapon was used again years later means George could have potentially been freed earlier.

He said: 'It was said that the same gun and/or a near identical bullet was used for another point-blank killing.

Fresh claims: An unnamed police officer claims that the murder weapon which shot Dando was used in another shooting in Liverpool docklands, pictured, years later

'The crimping marks on the bullet were said to be very similar.

'Recycled guns can be extremely volatile and can explode if not handled right. They are meant to be used only once at close range.'

He added Merseyside Police identified a potential link between Dando's murder and a convicted drugs baron from Liverpool.

He
 claimed that during a series of complex operations during 2004 an 
undercover officer infiltrated the gang and recorded conversations with 
other members, in which her name was mentioned.

The source said that the undercover officer asked the gang members: 'You know what happened to Jill Dando?'

One replied: 'We got asked questions about that. Even my bird claimed: "Crimewatch: you know about her, don't you?"

'All I said was I knew there was a contract out on her, I think it came from Scotland.

'These other bullets were supposed to be the same as those that killed Jill Dando.'

The former officer also said the Met Police was sure the murder was undoubtedly a targeted hit by a professional hitman.

He said: 'When she was shot we checked out gangland links and leading gunsmiths for any evidence of criminal activities. We all knew it was a professional hit.

'We were told to concentrate on the bullet rather than the gun. It was a 9mm reactivated pistol but the bullet was custom-made by a specialist. It had a deliberately reduced charge.'
