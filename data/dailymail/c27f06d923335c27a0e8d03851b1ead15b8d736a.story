The family of Woolwich terrorist Michael Adebolajo said last night they were horrified by the murder.They revealed their ‘profound shame and distress’ and sent their ‘heartfelt condolences’ to the family of slain soldier Lee Rigby.

In an extraordinary statement, they said they shared the horror of the nation at the ‘senseless killing’ and ‘fully expect’ that the killers will be brought to justice.

They added: ‘We wholeheartedly condemn all those who engage in acts of terror and fully reject any suggestion by them that religion or politics can justify this kind of violence.’

'Shame': The family of Michael Adebolajo, pictured carrying a knife and meat cleaver in the aftermath of the attack, have issued a statement condemning the 'senseless killing' of British soldier Lee Rigby

On another day of dramatic developments in the wake of the attack:

*  Adebolajo’s alleged accomplice 
Michael Adebowale, 22, was transferred under armed guard from a hospital
 bed to a high-security police cell for questioning;

*  Police raided a flat in Hither Green, south-east London, and told neighbours they were hunting for a ‘terror cell’;

*  Relatives of Muslim convert Hayden Allen, 21, suspected of helping the Woolwich killers, said he was ‘brainwashed’;

*  Adebolajo’s brother-in-law said he was ‘harassed’ by MI5 agents as they repeatedly tried to recruit him as an informant;

*  White convert Jordan Horner, 19, 
appeared in court accused of trying to enforce Sharia law after being 
arrested outside the home of hate preacher Anjem Choudary.

Last night, counter-terrorism 
detectives were preparing to question Adebowale, 22, over his role in 
the Woolwich horror last Wednesday.

He was caught on camera attempting 
to fire a revolver before being gunned down by armed police officers.

Murdered: Drummer Lee Rigby, of the British Army's 2nd Battalion The Royal Regiment of Fusiliers, was 'hacked to death' outside his army barracks in Woolwich last week

After being discharged by doctors, 
Adebowale was re-arrested on suspicion of attempting to murder a police 
officer, in addition to killing Drummer Rigby.

It is understood that 28-year-old Adebolajo is in a far more serious condition and could remain in hospital for ‘some time’.

Adebolajo’s family, who live in 
London, Lancashire and Nigeria, took the unusual step of releasing a 
statement through  their solicitors.

They said: ‘Nothing we can say can 
undo the events of last week.

'However, as a family, we wish to share 
with others our horror at the senseless killing of Lee Rigby, and 
express our profound shame and distress that this has brought to our 
family.

‘We send our heartfelt condolence to 
Lee Rigby’s family and loved ones.

'We wish to state openly that we 
believe that there is no place for violence in the name of religion or 
politics. We believe that all right-thinking members of society share 
this view wherever they were born and whatever their religion and 
political beliefs.’

So far, ten men have been arrested on suspicion of conspiring with the killers of the soldier.

Among them was Hayden Allen, who was Tasered by armed police during a 
raid on his home in Thamesmead, less than a mile from Woolwich.

His grandfather said the convert, who
 attended the same mosque as Adebolajo and Adebowale, was ‘brainwashed’ 
by Islamic preachers. Retired welder Noel Watson, 81, said: ‘Getting 
deep into things will only get you in trouble. I tried to talk him out 
of being a Muslim, but it didn’t register.’

A man accused of making threats on Facebook to make a bomb and massacre Muslims after the killing of drummer Lee Rigby has been arrested.

Tony Perrin, 27, a scaffolder, was arrested close to his home in Norbury, south London, on Saturday May 25, after police were made aware of his alleged threats on the social network.

He is accused of posting a message that was grossly offensive or of an indecent, obscene or menacing character. 

He has been bailed to appear at Hammersmith Magistrates’ Court on June 12.

It has emerged that both suspects 
were known to the Security Service and that Adebolajo was repeatedly 
approached after he tried to travel to Somalia to join Al Qaeda 
fighters.

Guantanamo Bay detainee Moazzam Begg,
 who runs a network to support terrorist suspects, said he was 
approached by Adebolajo’s family in April 2012.

He said: ‘They were in a state of 
great worry and didn’t know what to do. His immediate family members had
 been approached in order that he work with them.’

Meanwhile, teenage Muslim convert 
Jordan Horner, who is also known as Jamaal Uddin, appeared in court 
accused of being a  member of a radical group called Muslim Patrol.

Horner was arrested outside the home of hate preacher Choudary after a 
scuffle with photographers last Friday.

Yesterday magistrates were told he 
faces charges of assault and threatening behaviour following incidents 
on four dates in December and January.

In Kenya, local police are hunting members of the gang arrested with Adebolajo when he tried to cross into lawless Somalia.

Police raided a Lincolnshire house which is believed to be connected with Woolwich murder suspect Michael Adebolajo last week

The curtains at the house in Lincolnshire remained closed following last week's raid

Neighbours said the same family had lived in the house for about a decade

Adebolajo was considered a ‘dangerous
 radical’ intent on joining fellow jihadists Al-Shabaab when he was 
captured close to the border in November 2010.

The Kenyans claim the British 
‘ignored’ their warning about  Adebolajo, who they say was the 
ringleader of the radicalised gang arrested after arriving on an island 
near the border on a speedboat.

But under pressure from the British 
Embassy, Adebolajo was deported and his five co-accused were released on
 good-behaviour bonds.

 Michael Adebolajo, 28, was born in Lambeth, south London, in 1985 to a Christian family of Nigerian descent.

At the age of 15 or 16 he started getting involved in Islam and started to speak about Jihadi ideas.

He
 joined several extremist groups - including Al Muhajiroun - that were 
banned in Britain and in 2003 converted to Islam, calling himself 
Mujaheed while at Marshalls Park School.

Fearing he had become radicalised, his parents moved him away from Romford to a village in Lincolnshire.

He then went to university in Greenwich, living in Eltham while he was a student.

A former friend told the Evening Standard that he was a Christian.

The
 friend said: 'He started getting involved with Islam aged about 15 or 
16, and that is why his parents moved him away out of the area. It is 
utterly shocking to see what he has done. It’s unbelievable.'

The security services, including MI5, were aware of him and his suspected accomplice Michael Adebowale, 22, from Greenwich.

The Daily Mail has learned some of 
the group have been under surveillance by Kenyan authorities since the 
2010 arrests. It is thought several may have remained in communication 
with Adebolajo, who tried to re-enter Kenya last year.

Now Kenyan police want to speak to 
the five again so they can pass any new information to the anti-terror 
officers at Scotland Yard.

Ambrose Munysia, the commander of 
Kenya’s coast province criminal investigations, said: ‘Some of them have
 disappeared and we are trying to look for them in connection with what 
happened in 2010.’
