Christian schools in Britain are under investigation by the European Commission for allegedly 'discriminating' against non-religious teachers.

The probe could ultimately force schools with a Christian ethos to stop giving preference to religious staff when recruiting, it is understood.

The schools will be scrutinised to see if expressing a preference for religious teachers – and having the right to pay them more than non-believing colleagues – breaches equality laws.

European Union rules state that a school must be able to prove a 'genuine occupational requirement' in order to discriminate in favour of a religious candidate.

Many schools which advertise for staff list a religion as a 'desirable feature' in those who apply.

However, the British Humanist Association, whose complaints sparked the inquiry, says describing religious adherence as 'desirable' falls short of the EU standard.

Richy Thompson, campaigns officer at the BHA, told the Times Education Supplement: 'If religious practice is a 'desirable' quality and not an essential one, then it cannot be a genuine occupational requirement. It should either be essential or not there at all.'

Other faith schools including Muslim and Jewish schools will also be examined.

The case also brings into question government guidance that gives voluntary-aided faith schools, which are part-funded by religious organisations, the freedom to apply 'religious criteria when recruiting or dismissing any member of their teaching staff'.

The schools can give preference to religious candidates in 'recruitment, remuneration and promotion', Equality Act guidance states.

The BHA has asked the commission to investigate whether the government guidance is at odds with the EU directive.

Paul Barber, director of the Catholic Education Service, told the TES that faith schools should determine 'on an individual basis' whether they required a religious candidate for a particular role.

He said: 'They need to look at the full circumstances of each job.'

Simon Calvert of the Christian Institute said: 'Church schools are hugely popular with parents.

'They are oversubscribed and they dominate performance tables. The church ethos is why they have high standards and why they do such a good job of preparing children for life in 21st-century Britain.

'It's disappointing that humanists seem to be so intolerant of religious organisations seeking to remain religious. There's a relentless agenda to secularise religious organisations. If they were to succeed, it would severely damage these church schools and undermine the great work that they do.'

A spokesman for the London Diocesan Board for Schools, which runs 133 primary schools and 20 secondaries, said its schools usually sought a 'Christian commitment' only when filling senior leadership positions. He added: 'However, even then, in the majority of those cases, a school will be looking more for someone who will actively support the Christian traditions and ethos of the school, rather than a 'card-carrying' member of the Christian church.

'We have senior staff in our schools who are adherents of various faiths and many who have no personal faith.'

A spokesman for the Department for Education said the Government's guidance allowing faith schools to apply religious criteria was in line with the 'genuine occupational requirement' rule set out in the EU directive.

A spokesman for the European Commission confirmed it is considering the complaint and had contacted the British authorities.
