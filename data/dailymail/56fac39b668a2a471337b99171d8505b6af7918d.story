TV favourite Bob the Builder has had a refurbishment of his own - with a fresh look and a new voice for the next series

TV favourite Bob the Builder has had a refurbishment of his own - with a fresh look and a new voice.

Actor Lee Ingleby, who is starring in BBC1 drama Our Zoo, takes over from Neil Morrissey, who voiced the handyman from his launch a decade and a half ago.

Also joining the series when it airs next year will be Downton Abbey's Joanne Froggatt - as Bob's business partner Wendy - and Inbetweeners star Blake Harrison, who voices the digger Scoop.

Ingleby - also known for his role as Stan Shunpike in Harry Potter And The Prisoner Of Azkaban - said: 'I was very excited to be given the opportunity to be the voice of such a well-loved character. 

'My little nephew is such a huge fan of Bob that I had to jump at the chance. 

'Capturing a child's imagination is so important, and I just wish I was half as good at DIY as Bob is.'

Froggatt said: 'My godchildren are huge fans of the show so I'm looking forward to seeing their reactions when the new series begins.

'Wendy is a strong and positive female role model and I think it is important that children's television shows positive social values.'

Viewers will see a big difference on screen as the characters will be computer-generated for the new series rather than created using stop-motion animation. 

Bob also has a new home in the bustling metropolis of Spring City, and will use a computer for his building designs, but he will still be seen working at his yard in the village of Fixham.

Harrison joked that the show was more family-friendly than his appearances in E4's Inbetweeners, which has also led to a pair of hit spin-off films.

'I'm really excited to be a part of such a long-running, successful series. I'm even more excited to be involved in a project that my daughter can watch before she's 30.

'Working on an animation is completely new to me, but as a method actor I know only one way to prepare for a role, so I've painted myself yellow and am now offering to dig up anything you may need.'

Christopher Kennan, executive producer of HIT Entertainment, the firm behind Bob, said: 'While the new series retains the emotional warmth that has always given Bob The Builder a firm place in the hearts of young viewers, it's now packed with more humour than ever before.' 

Also joining the series when it airs next year will be Downton Abbey's Joanne Froggatt - as Bob's business partner Wendy - and Inbetweeners star Blake Harrison, who voices the digger Scoop
