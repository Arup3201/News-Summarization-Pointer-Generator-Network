With 12 cleaning modes, it is being billed as the Swiss Army knife of vacuum cleaners – and it could certainly threaten Dyson.

British company G-tech is taking on its bigger rival with a cleaner that is cordless, lightweight and even has headlights to help track down dirt in the darkest corners.

Just 18 months ago, G-tech launched its AirRam upright power sweeper which so far this year has shifted 135,000 models, making it the best-selling cordless vacuum cleaner in the UK and overtaking Dyson in this sector.

Rivalry: G-Tech are bringing out the new Multi, which follows in the success of the AirRam power sweeper

But the firm, based in rural Worcestershire, is not content to stop there and is deploying another weapon in the fight for supremacy – the handheld G-tech Multi. 

The Multi is powered by a lithium-ion battery – the sort of thing found in smartphones, iPads and electric cars – which means it can run for 30 minutes on a four-hour charge.

Its attachments include a built-in crevice tool, a smaller round tough brush for stubborn grime and a seven-inch wide tool for cleaning sofas and curtains.

Despite its small size and weight – just 1.6kg, or 3.5lb – it includes a pull-out tube to reach tricky spots. There is also a rigid extension tube to tackle dust in high places.

The new device sells for £149, compared to around £173 for Dyson’s closest equivalent, the DC34 Animal. It will be available via John Lewis or from the G-tech website.

Design: The new model has a smaller brush to cope with grime and a tool for cleaning sofas and curtains

Technology: The vacuum is powered by a Lithium-ion battery give 30 minutes of run time on a four hour charge

Scientist and broadcaster Adam Hart-Davis, who unveiled the new Multi, said: ‘The vacuum cleaner design is essentially 100 years old, but what we need to clean difficult, hard to get at areas is something light with fascinating features. 

‘Something that will clean curtains, around the back of sofas,  all those areas you can’t get at with an AirRam. What you need is a Swiss Army knife of a vacuum cleaner and that is what they have come up with.’

He said the addition of headlights means users can see the dirt that they are trying to get rid of, particularly in dark, hard to reach places such as car footwells.

Growing: The company has a team of 50, led by designer, inventor and founder, Nick Grey

Nick Grey, G-tech’s designer, inventor and founder, said he discovered from online reviews of the AirRam that many customers reverted to using old-style heavy cleaners with long hoses and tools for getting at inaccessible places.

As a result, he said, the firm developed the handheld Multi as a partner to the AirRam, adding: ‘These two products together will consign the heavy, corded, energy-eating vacuum cleaners to history.’

G-tech’s turnover is expected  to double to in excess of £20million this year, with sales continuing  to grow.

Dyson denied it is being out-sold by Gtech on cordless cleaners and claimed a better comparison to the G-tech Multi would be its new DC59, which costs £349.99.

A spokesman said: ‘The DC59 marks something quite revolutionary in vacuum cleaning. It is the world’s first cordless vacuum cleaner to achieve the same performance as a full-size plug in vacuum cleaner. It literally sucks up as much dust as a conventional machine.

‘That is remarkable considering it is battery powered. 100 air watts on a cordless is huge. It actually offers people a real alternative to lugging around the conventional vacuum but at the same time it offers the lightweight, versatility of a handheld too.’
