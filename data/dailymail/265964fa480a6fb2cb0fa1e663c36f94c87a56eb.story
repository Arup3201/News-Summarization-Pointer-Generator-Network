A group of law students were at the centre of a racism row today after they 'blacked up' for a fancy dress drinking session.

The 'Beerienteering' event, organised by The Edinburgh University Law Society, had an Around The World fancy dress code.

But four members sparked outrage after pictures emerged of them dressed as Somali pirates with their faces painted black.

Racism row: Students from the Edinburgh University Law Society pose as Somali pirates with their faces painted black for a fancy dress drinking event

The group - made up of three males and one female - happily posed for pictures but were later challenged by angry members of other societies.

One student said: 'This is an image of black and ethnic minority oppression becoming manifested in students' costumes.

'Racism should be opposed on every level and Edinburgh University and we as a student body should do all within our power to make sure these attitudes are called out.'

An official event page describes Beerienteering as 'a steeplechase around the bars of Edinburgh full of plenty challenges and surprises' and tells attendees to 'expect over-the-top fancy dress.'

Teams of four students including one girl, must race around Edinburgh's pubs completing various ‘challenges’ along the way to find out their next destination.

The winning team is the one which completes the route in the shortest time.

It is understood that door staff at 
The Hive nightclub in the city were challenged by other students after 
allowing the controversial group entry to the venue.

'Should not be condoned': The group - made up of three males and one female - happily posed for pictures but were later challenged by angry members of other societies

The door staff are believed to have replied that those who were offended could 'head somewhere else'.

The
Edinburgh University Law Society is an independent society and is not 
affiliated with the Edinburgh University Students Association (EUSA).

Nadia
Mehdi, vice president of Societies and Activities at EUSA, said: 'I’m 
really shocked to see that in this day and age these students weren't 
aware of or chose to ignore the offence they would cause by painting 
their faces black.

'It's not
acceptable and should not be condoned. The Law Society is not a EUSA 
society so we can’t discipline them, but I will be bringing this to the 
attention of the Law School.'

Keir Gilius, President of the Law Society, said in a statement: 'The fancy dress theme was All Around the World.

'As
a society, we try to arrange our events with innovative and interesting
themes leaving scope for attendees to use their imaginations.

'In
no way was this theme intended to incite racism or cultural 
appropriation and, as a society, we are vehemently opposed to 
discrimination of any form.

'On behalf of the members of our society, we apologise unreservedly for any upset caused.

'In
response to some of the costumes designed, in the future we will strive
to ensure that any fancy dress events will actively discourage the use 
of any costumes that could be perceived as being offensive.

'If so, the wearers may be denied participation in said event.

'As a society, we respect our members’ right to freedom of expression, however, cultural insensitivity is intolerable and this is something that we are completely opposed to.

'In light of the ongoing and comprehensive commentary on our Facebook page, I would not propose to discuss any further details.'

A spokesman for the University of Edinburgh said: 'The University takes issues relating to equality and diversity very seriously and hopes and expects that all members of the University community do the same.

'To this end, it has a range of relevant policies and procedures in place to address such issues as they arise.'

Students from the university in Scotland are

even appeared to make mock Nazi salutes after a joke with a 
German-related punchline

The row comes just days after a shocking video of university students singing sexist songs on a packed public bus went viral.

The mobile phone footage shows male members of the University of Stirling’s hockey club drinking beer and shouting derogatory sexual and racist chants while other passengers look on.

The students from the university in Scotland are filmed laughing at a joke about miscarriages and at one point even appeared to make mock Nazi salutes after a joke with a German-related punchline.

The video - filmed last Wednesday as students took the 63 bus from the university into Stirling town centre - has been viewed around 35,000 times on YouTube after being posted on Monday.

Women on board were clearly uncomfortable about the antics of the team - who were singing the traditional drinking song I Used to Work in Chicago - and one said: ‘This is quite scary.’

Richard Raymond, vice-president of education at the university's student union, was on the bus and has apologised for not doing more to stop the singing.
