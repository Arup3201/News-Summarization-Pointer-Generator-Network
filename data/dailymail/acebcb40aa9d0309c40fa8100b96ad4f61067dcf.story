The world may be preparing for the showdown between Floyd Mayweather and Manny Pacquiao in May, but Andre Wisdom was more keen to get his Mike Tyson on as he trained with some pad work.

Wisdom shared the video of himself with his trainer in the ring, and looked in mighty impressive nick with a pair of gloves on as he imitated the legendary boxer.

And the Liverpool defender, who is currently on loan at West Brom, captioned it with 'Big up mike for the sessions past few days helping me get my Tyson on.'

Wisdom is keeping himself in shape as he finds himself outside of Baggies boss Tony Pulis' plans. 

The 21-year-old defender was virtually an ever-present during the early part of the season under Alan Irvine, but has fallen out of favour since his departure, being omitted from their last seven Premier League games.

Wisdom also has 10 caps for the Under-21 side, but hasn't featured for them since 2013.
