While not everything that glitters is gold, the sparkling new polish from celebrity manicurist Deborah Lippmann most certainly is.

Instead of metallic plastic, the festive sparkle in Boom Boom Pow, £18, was created by including shavings of real 24-carat gold.

And with famous fans that include Lady 
Gaga, Lena Dunham, Kelly Clarkson and Sarah Jessica Parker, the luxury 
lacquer has already secured the A-list seal of approval.

But Boom Boom Pow isn't the only Lippmann polish to contain an unexpectedly expensive ingredient: also available are polishes that contain powdered diamonds and crushed pearls.

Other highlights from the range, which launches at Selfridges and Look Fantastic this month, include striking chrome effect polishes and the Staccato collection which combines pastel hues with striking black glitter.

As a result, the brand has become a regular on the fashion circuit with Valentino, Bulgari and Burberry among those to enlist Lippmann for their shows.

The manicurist has also created bespoke looks for some of the biggest celebrity names in the business.

Most famously, Lippmann did the nails of Reese Witherspoon on the night she took home an Oscar for her part in Johnny Cash biopic Walk The Line in 2005.

Lippmann has also teamed up with some of her celebrity clients to produce bespoke shades that are available for the rest of us to buy.

Among the A-list approved hues are Lara's Theme, a bright orange-coral created with the help of model Lara Stone, and the glamorous deep-red Just Walk Away Renee, which was originally made for Renee Zellweger.
