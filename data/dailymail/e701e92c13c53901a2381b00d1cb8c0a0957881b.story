Chelsea hold the advantage in their Champions League last-16 tie against Paris Saint-Germain after scoring a crucial away goal in a 1-1 draw on Tuesday night.

Branislav Ivanovic opened the scoring for the visitors in the first leg at the Parc des Princes before Edinson Cavani hauled the home side level in the second half.

Jose Mourinho’s side then survived an onslaught from the Ligue 1 side to secure a vital draw.

And history suggests that the Stamford Bridge club will almost certainly secure their place in the quarter-finals as the Blues have never lost a two-legged tie in Europe after securing a score draw away from home in the first leg.

Of the five games Chelsea have secured a draw with goals away from Stamford Bridge in the opening tie, Chelsea have always progressed.

Moreover, their opponents PSG have never progressed in any European competition when they have drawn at home in the first leg with goals scored. 

And of Mourinho's two-legged ties in which his team has opened with a score draw away from home, the Portuguese has always progressed to the next round. 

And judging by these statistics it would be a brave man to back against him making it six from six when Chelsea host PSG at Stamford Bridge on Match 11.
