A second woman has been arrested on Thursday night as the third suspect in connection with the killing of the young wife of a U.S. Marine at Camp Pendleton.

Dorothy Grace Marie Maraglino, 36, of Fallbrook, California, was taken into custody at a hotel in downtown San Diego, Sheriff Bill Gore said in a written statement.

The Naval Criminal Investigative Service assisted in the arrest, according to the statement.

Mystery suspect: Dorothy Grace Marie Maraglino (pictured) was arrested in San Diego in connection with the April murder of 22-year-old Brittany, Dawn Killgore

Gore said that Maraglino was taken into custody as a result of information and evidence obtained during the ongoing investigation into Brittany Dawn Killgore's death.

Killgore, 22, was last seen April 13, three days after she filed for divorce from her husband, Lance Corporal Cory Killgore. Her body was found in brush near Lake Skinner on April 17.

Authorities did not mention what role investigators believe Maraglino played in the alleged murder.

The 36-year-old was ordered held without bail. She is expected to be arraigned on Monday at the Vista branch of San Diego County Superior Court

The other suspects in the killing are Maraglino's boyfriend, Louis Ray Perez, 45, a 
Camp Pendleton Marine staff sergeant, and Jessica Lynn Lopez, 25, who 
was a roommate of Perez and Maraglino. Both have pleaded not guilty to 
murder.

During Perez's arraignment in April, prosecutors revealed that Killgore met him for a night out after she filed for divorce. Another woman was supposed to join them, but canceled last minute. During their date, however, something apparently went awry.

‘She sent a text saying, 'Help,'' said Patrick Espinoza, a deputy San Diego County district attorney. ‘She was missing from that point on.’

According to Espinoza, investigators found Killgore's blood and a weapon in Perez's car. He also said Perez told investigators he dropped off Killgore in downtown San Diego's Gaslamp District, but investigators concluded that he lied about his whereabouts and stayed about 60 miles north in Fallbrook, where Killgore lived.

Authorities said Killgore's body was found hours after paramedics were called to a San Diego motel and found Lopez with self-inflicted cuts and a suicide note.

Tragic: The body of Brittany Killgore was discovered on Tuesday, four days after she was last seen with a marine who was later arrested on an unrelated charge

Suspect: Authorities believe that the victim knew Jessica Lynn Lopez (pictured here), and the two were involved in some kind of sex slave ring

While authorities would not elaborate 
on the nature of the relationship between Lopez and the victim, Lopez's 
neighbor claims she and Mrs Killgore were involved in a dangerous sex 
ring, playing sex slaves.

According to online profiles cited by the San Diego Union-Tribune, Perez and Maraglino were also involved in sadomasochism and bondage.

The prosecutor said Lopez and 
Perez once lived together but didn't indicate when or where. Lopez lives
a mile from Killgore's second-floor apartment overlooking Camp 
Pendleton.It is still unclear how Killgore died.

Cory Killgore has not been named as a suspect or person of interest in the killing. The couple married in July of 2010.

Lopez's attorney Dean Broyles said he
didn't know if his client knew Perez or Mrs Killgore, who was reported 
missing one day after Lopez turned 25.

'There's a lot of speculation, a lot of innuendo, a lot of weak allegations and charges out there,' he said.

'I would caution everyone to not jump to conclusions and prejudge based on all the information flying around right now.'

Lopez's parents, who live in nearby Escondido, 
released a statement saying they loved their daughter.

'We
pray for the family of Brittany Killgore and ask that the Lord comfort 
them during their time of grief and anguish,' the parents said.

'We ask that you pray for all of those impacted by this tragic situation, including our family.'

Authorities have not disclosed Mrs Killgore, Lopez, and Perez are connected.

A neighbour, who declined to be identified, told ABC 10 that both Lopez and the victim took part in some kind of sex ring.

She said: 'They're into the sex slave things... I try not to judge, but that's what they're into.'

Missing: Brittany Killgore lived in Fallbrook, California, not far from Camp Pendleton US Marine base

Perez, 45, had initially pleaded not guilty to stealing a AR-15 rifle from Camp Pendleton, but was re-arrested on April 24 and charged with Killgore's death.

Lopez's bail was set at $3 million.

Mrs Killgore went missing shortly after 
filing for divorce from her husband, Cory Killgore a 22-year-old Marine deployed to 
Afghanistan.

Her body was found in brush in Riverside 
County about 25 miles northeast of her modest, two-story apartment in 
Fallbrook, a San Diego County community known for its avocado orchards.

Killgore lived a short walk from an 
entrance to Camp Pendleton, and her complex - like others around it - is
full of Marines and their families who tend to be short-term residents 
and often don't get to know each other well.

Fears: Cory, right, is returning from Afghanistan after hearing about the disappearance of his wife, left

Killgore's husband, Lance Corporal 
Cory Killgore, flew back to California after learning his wife was
missing.

The couple from Missouri were married
in July 2010. Brittany Killgore filed for divorce April 10 and listed 
'irreconcilable differences' as the reason. She gave no details on the 
paperwork.

Her cellphone was found in the Gaslamp District of downtown San Diego, an area populated with bars and restaurants.

Darryl J Wrest of Rolla, Missouri, 
confirmed Brittany Killgore is his daughter but said he was not 
commenting on anything at this time. Killgore's other family members 
also declined to comment.

Authorities investigating the homicide said a suicide note
of the prime suspect contained key details about the case, including 
the location of a body.

Serious: The Fallbrook scene where Louis Ray Perez is being questioned in connection with the disappearance

Authorities in California are now reportedly examining a possible link between Killgore, the suspect, and a seedy sex ring.

ABC 10 reported that officers later responded to a Ramada Inn near the San Diego Airport, 
where they found a woman with stab wounds all over her body in an 
apparent suicide attempt.

That woman, 25-year-old Lopez, was arrested at the scene but hospitalized at UCSD Medical Center.

Cory Killgore was deployed to Afghanistan earlier this year as a vehicle operator.

Since his wife's murder, Killgore has spoken 
publicly about her just once, saying in a statement that she 
was 'beautiful beyond words' and that he was 'devastated' by her loss, according to Patch.

'My duty to her memory is now to ensure her good reputation remains 
intact, and help law enforcement and prosecutors secure justice for the 
person or persons who took her away from me,' he said.
