Feng Ku, 32, caught fire and ran away from the crash which took place in Zheijang province, eastern China

Kang Liao, 22, saw the accident and said: 'There was an horrific bang and screeching of brakes and then I saw the guy fly off his bike and land on the ground.

'Then he just burst into flames and ran off with a bloodcurdling scream which went right through me, before collapsing on the ground.

'It was horrible.'

Chen Tsao, 33, is a trained medic.

'By the time I got to him he was on the ground and writhing in pain.

'I threw my jacket over him to extinguish the flames and then told him to lie still while I phoned for an ambulance.'

He said: 'I saw the man running up the road covered in flames 

Mr Ku is captured crashing into the car in China as the bike starts to skid with him still on it 

Police believe the crash caused the petrol tank to explode and the bike's skid created a spark starting the fire

The petrol appears to ignite from the spark, which then seems to set light to the 32-year-old's suit 

Mr Ku catches fire and becomes a 'human fireball', shortly before his motorbike also bursts into flames

He is pictured, covered in flames, and running away from the crash - in a likely attempt to douse the flames 

Mr Ku runs away and is helped by Chen Tao, a trained medic, who extinguishes the flames with his jacket

A police spokesman said: 'Having analysed the CCTV footage it seems that the collision caused the motorbike's petrol tank to spill and the friction caused by the sliding bike created a spark which set the whole lot on fire.

'He is very lucky to be alive.'

Feng was taken to hospital with minor burns and is in a stable condition.
