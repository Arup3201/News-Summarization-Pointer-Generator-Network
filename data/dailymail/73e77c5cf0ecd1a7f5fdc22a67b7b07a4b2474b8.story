Families with children who suffer from Cockayne Syndrome, a rare genetic disease characterized by premature aging, gathered at the weekend in Alexandra, Virginia, to share experiences about a condition that can typically leave them feeling isolated.

People with this syndrome have smaller 
than normal head sizes, are of short stature, their eyes appear sunken, 
and they have an 'aged' look.

They can suffer from a raft of health issues 
more often found in the elderly including: vision loss, hearing loss, Parkinson’s type symptoms 
(tremors), hair loss, liver and kidney problems and dementia.

Families with children who suffer from Cockayne Syndrome, a rare genetic disease characterized by premature aging, gathered at the weekend in Alexandra, Virginia, to share experiences

Experts say children with Cockayne 
syndrome are mostly happy and jovial, despite their conditions.

Some may develop bits of gray hair, wrinkled skin or high 
blood pressure. Those with severe cases often live only a few years, 
while less severe onsets can affect people into their 40s.

Scientists are still searching for 
answers about the disease, estimated to affect one in 500,000 children 
but difficult to diagnose.

Jackie
Clark said she knew something wasn't right with her baby, Gigi, shortly
after she was born, even though doctors said everything was fine. Soon 
they found Gigi had cataracts. They later found a problem with her nerve
endings that made her itchy all the time.

Cockayne syndrome (CS) is very rare disease resulting in slow growth in babies as well as rapid aging (a form of progeria).

Persons with this syndrome have smaller 
than normal head sizes, are of short stature, their eyes appear sunken, 
and they have an 'aged' look.

It is estimated to affect one in 500,000 children 
but difficult to diagnose.

For CS patients who are affected at 
birth, life expectancy is 3–7 years.

Other patients only start to show symptoms
in early childhood and their life expectancy tends to be under 20 years.

However, 
some rare CS patients live significantly longer.

Individuals
with CS are extremely sensitive to the sunlight and sunburn easily so 
they mostly stay indoors during normal daylight hours.

CS is often described as a 'progeria-like syndrome'.

Progeria is an extremely rare genetic disease wherein symptoms resembling aspects of aging are manifested at an early age.

One of the earliest influences of progeria on popular culture 
occurred in the 1922 short story The Curious Case of Benjamin Button by 
F. Scott Fitzgerald (and later released as a feature film in 2008 staring Brad Pitt).

The 
main character, Benjamin Button, is born as a seventy-year-old man and 
ages backwards; a scenario inspired by 
progeria.

‘Slowly everything started to unravel as we discovered that she couldn't hear and she wasn't developing right,' Clark said.

'It
took us five years before we were able to figure out that she had 
Cockayne syndrome. At that point, she was already close to the end of 
her lifespan. She died four months later.'’

Now
Clark leads the Share and Care Cockayne Syndrome Network and organizes 
the conference each year for families to meet. She said the gatherings 
help because the disease can be isolating.

A total of 43 CS families from around the country and other parts of the world came together at the weekend for the 14th annual International Family Conference.

Because of the sensitivity of those children suffering from CS, a night time outing was arranged on the Cherry Blossom river cruise on the Potomac River for a tour of the Washington, DC monuments lit up at night.

Two CS suffers celebrated their birthday’s during the event: Hannah Crego from New York who turned 13 years old and Colt Stillwell from Alabama will celebrated his milestone birthday of 21 years old.

For parents it was an opportunity to share tips on caring for their children with a raft of health needs. Other discussions focused on helping the well siblings of CS patients to cope with the day to day issues. While for kids with CS it was a rare opportunity to meet others like themselves.

Scientists and researchers joined them to observe their symptoms and to search for ways to provide treatment.

Dr. Edward Neilan, a leading researcher 
and pediatrician who has treated children with Cockayne at Boston 
Children's Hospital, and a handful of other researchers often attend the
conferences to help them search for answers in recognizing and treating
the disease.

‘Once you've seen a condition, it takes on a personal, memorable aspect to you and becomes easier to recognize’ he said.

‘But
if you've never seen it before and you're only relying on textbooks, 
it's very hard to recognize something that you've never seen before.’

The event was an opportunity for CS suffers and their siblings to play together with other kids in the same situation

Genetic
testing can detect mutations that cause the disease, but to diagnose 
the condition in a child, a doctor would have to suspect Cockayne in 
order to test the patient's cells, experts said.

Many patients develop a
distinct facial appearance, and some families self-diagnose their 
children and seek help.

Dr. Philip J. Brooks, an adjunct investigator
and rare disease researcher at the National Institutes of Health, 
developed a hypothesis that the brain disease is caused by cells that 
aren't making proteins they need to function normally. Then the cells 
are prone to dying.

Brooks said meeting affected children over the 
past eight years sparked his interest in the rare condition. He said it 
hasn't received much research focus or public attention.

'I had 
learned about it in textbooks and seen pictures, but that's not the same
thing as seeing it,' he said. 'That had a big impact on me and made me 
want to study this and to do something to help these people.'

Over the years, he said he has observed the progression of the disease and listened to the parents' observations.

At
this year's conference in Alexandria, Dr. Alan Weiner, a 
biochemistry professor at the University of Washington, conducted a 
blood draw for research funded by the National Institutes of Health to 
try to determine what causes Cockayne syndrome. He is testing whether 
the children's' cells have the same protein symptoms as laboratory 
cells.

'If they do, it might suggest new remedies that could actually be tried now,' he said.

A
small biopharmaceutical company recently tried to develop a treatment 
but ran out of money. The treatment was never fully developed, Neilan 
said.

Parents are anxious to know more about the disease. Haylee 
Carroll of Knoxville, Tenn., had three children with the syndrome and 
two healthy children.

Her first two children were never fully diagnosed 
with the condition before they died. Now her 3-month-old baby, Eris, her
fifth child, also shows signs of the disease.

'We still haven't ever
had a piece of paper that says they have this. That would be nice to 
have,' she said. 'We know that they have it, but it would be nice just 
to have (confirmation).'
