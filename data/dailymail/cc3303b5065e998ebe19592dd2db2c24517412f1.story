Now this is a man who loves his job!

A plumber from Dundee has become an overnight sensation thanks to a hilarious video - filmed by his co-worker - which catches him in the middle of an epic dance sequence.

Mark Topen was caught showing off his moves to a Robert Miles song - when he should have been working. 

The 52-year-old plumber spoke to the Evening Telegraph after the video hit the Internet on Thursday, saying: 'I'll admit that it was a bit embarrassing at first, but I suppose that is what is funny about it and I can see that now.

'It's not something I would do all the time because it can be disrespectful to do it in people's homes but this house was empty.

'I definitely think that it helps that I have a character where I can get away with it.

'Sometimes the job can be stressful, so it’s good to take the pressure off if you can.'

In the amusing footage, Mark, known to his friends as Toby, really gives it his all - even performing an impressive spin at one point.

Still, becoming something of a local celebrity has all been a bit 'unbelievable.' 

He said: 'It’s been amazing and I have received so many calls and texts from people telling me they have seen it online.

Mark Topen was understandably embarrassed upon learning he'd been discovered, but soon laughed it off

'In one day I had over 100 people text me to say they’ve seen the video and couldn’t help but laugh.

'I have been stopped by people in KFC and McDonalds, asking for an autograph which is quite surreal.

'It’s good to know that people are laughing with me and not at me.

'My wife works at the Meganni Franklyn salon on Clepington Road and said that everyone in there has found it funny.'
