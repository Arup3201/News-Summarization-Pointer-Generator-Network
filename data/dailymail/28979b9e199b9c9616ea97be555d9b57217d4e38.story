Per Mertesacker believes Arsenal's trip to Manchester City this weekend will be a 'big test' of their top-four credentials.

Mounting injury problems have weakened the Gunners ahead of Sunday's trip to the Etihad Stadium.

It is a match Arsene Wenger's side approach fresh from a 3-0 home win against Stoke - a return to winning ways several of the north London club's players celebrated when the NBA returned to London on Wednesday evening.

Jack Wilshere, Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain and Mathieu Flamini were amongst the Arsenal contingent at the O2 Arena, where the New York Knicks were demolished 95-79 by the Milwaukee Bucks.

Mertesacker knows the Gunners cannot afford to be on the end of a similarly one-sided result this weekend and believes the trip to the basketball has aided the team ahead of the City match.

'As well as bonding, we had team chat as well,' said the German defender.

'It is never too early to prepare, but it is good for us and the team as well.

'We had a good last game and January is a good time to come down and have a bit of a relax, but to switch on at the weekend.

'The rhythm is a bit slower so we have more recovery, but we have to switch on quickly at the weekend.

'It is a big test for us [to see] if we can compete for the top four on Sunday. That's it.' 

Alexis Sanchez has been the Gunners' outstanding player of the season with 18 goals so far this season 

Arsene Wenger's side are currently fifth in the Premier League, one point off the Champions League positions
