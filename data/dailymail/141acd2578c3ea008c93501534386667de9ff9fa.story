The Japanese invented one of the world's favourite foods, sushi, and are mad on their iPhones.

Combine the two, thought one mad-cap Japanese designer and businessman, and we'll have the perfect item - the sushi phone.

By crafting perfect imitations of Japanese food to adorn iPhone covers Masatatsu Kajikawa says he is helping iPhone fans watch videos on their handsets with ease as the sushi doubles as a stand, while making a style statement.

The fake sushi looks incredibly realistic, such as this giant piece clasped to a fan's ear (left) and a fried shrimp sushi model on in iPhone cover (right)

This piece of sushi roll looks almost good enough to eat - but it's actually made by fake food artisans 

You can certainly believe creator Masatatsu Kajikawa when he says: 'I love sushi so very, very much'

The food items such as chunky maguro tuna sushi help the iPhone to stand upright and facilitate the phones use of as a mini monitor says Kajikawa, who also runs a kerosene heater factory near Osaka when he's not creating new start-ups.

Crafted in the fashion of customised mobile cases - a style Japanese call decoden - the 33-year- old designer wanted to celebrate 16 years since the birth of the mobile internet revolution in Japan and his love of sushi.

'I love sushi so very, very much, so my passion for raw fish made me want to create these cases, for sushi lovers all over the world. 

'I think everyone can have a laugh just looking at these funny crazy cases,' he said.

Mr Kajikawa's case covers are made by the same fake food artisans who create the realistic displays of food outside some restaurants in Japan to entice customers inside.

Such displays are also a gift to non-Japanese speaking visitors who would otherwise be clueless about the diner's menu. 

So realistic and appealing are some of the items that a tourist trade has sprung up around collectors who want to take the plastic food home with them. 

Once made from wax, now high quality plastic resin is used instead and carefully sculpted to look like the actual dishes.

Customisation of phones, known as decoden, is big business in Japan - though sushi isn't always involved

'Each iPhone case is handmade so I won't be producing a lot of them,' says Mr. Kajikawa. 'But I hope to have them on the market next month through Amazon; selling a few thousand every month.'

He has so far come up with a few sushi favourites as well as other Japanese standards such as deep fried prawns and hamburger steaks.

Personalised customisation of phones, known as decoden, is big business in Japan. It took off at about the same time as the launch of the world's first commercial mobile internet service by Docomo, called i-mode, 16 years ago this month.

Years ahead of its time with mobiles that made foreign competition look like toddler's toys, Docomo's imode and its phones were the forerunners of today's apps and app-ecosystems.

Worth in the region of 10 billion yen a year decoden, a portmanteau of 'decoration' and the Japanese word for phone 'denwa, is crossing Japan's borders into Asia and inspiring smart phone personalisation elsewhere.

3-D printing has added new opportunities to the personalisation of phones, tablets and other electronics, enabling designers to make perfect renditions of their work at a fraction of the cost of hand crafting.

'When you're living in Tokyo surrounded by 30 million familiar faces, you value things which help you stand out'

So those Japanese with more dash than cash are learning how to achieve a blinged-out look DIY-style, while demanding more from their pocket rockets – in Japan it's a wallet, a TV, a teacher, opens doors, as well as a style statement.

'Japan has a culture of charms and trinkets ('omamori' etc) which mobile phones bring into the 21st century. Add to that, Japanese (especially young Japanese) put more effort into display. 

'When you're living in Tokyo surrounded by 30 million familiar faces, you value things which help you stand out, even if it's a small and innocuous trinket,' says Graham Brown of the consultancy Total Youth Research.

Some are given to lavishly decorating their phones with Swarovski gems or a $70 Chanel-designed strap for their beloved phones.

Others look to brands like cute food-like-accessories maker Q-pot that sells thousands of its melted chocolate-themed covers at $50 a go.

Commuters often yank out their cell phones to reveal sweet-like mascots hanging from the antennae, heart-shaped decoils, even hand painted butterflies. 

They also sport personalised screen savers, ringtones and dabbled with changeable faceplates.

You can even get sushi-shaped earrings and a key-ring - all part of the bizarre Japanese craze

Japan has become so mad about its mobiles they have even slowed the national walking pace as the nation peers into their hand-helds to check their emails and surf the net. 

The country practically invented the smartphone and the mobile internet 16 years ago this month - long before the iPhone and even Wikipedia existed.

Leaving the market for Japanese mobile phone technology in the doldrums Docomo was good at pulling it all together in Japan but when the operators and manufacturers exported their ideas they stumbled because they weren't very good at building relationships with foreign carriers,' says Mr Brown on why Japan was unable to capitalise on its its head start with smartphones and mobile internet.

But Japan remains queen of the decodenas, as its mobiles receive makeovers that would make Laurence Llewellyn Bowen blush. 

'It's all about love' says the manager of Japan's biggest mobile accessory outfit – and it might be coming to a deserving smartphone near you soon.
