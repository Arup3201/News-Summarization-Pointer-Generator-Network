By studying cores of ice (like the one pictured), the researchers believe they could reveal why the Earth's atmosphere underwent a transition roughly one million years ago

Patches of Antarctic ice may unlock secrets about the earth up to one-and-a-half million years old, Swiss scientists have said.

They hope a multi-million pound expedition to sample some of the ice will solve an ancient climate change mystery that continues to baffle experts.

By studying cores of ice, the researchers believe they could reveal why the Earth’s atmosphere underwent a transition roughly one million years ago.

Three kilometres under the Antarctic ice sheet are layers of compacted snow that fell up to one-and-half million years ago and trapped bubbles of the Earth’s atmosphere at the time.

Scientists on the planned exhibition, which could cost in the region of £40million, would extract this natural log book by extracting an ice core between 2.4 and three km long from the Antarctic ice shelf.

Experimental climate physicist, Professor Hubertus Fischer, at the University of Bern, Switzerland  said: 'The Mid Pleistocene Transition is a most important and enigmatic time interval in the more recent climate history of our planet.

'The Earth’s climate naturally varies between times of warming and periods of extreme cooling (ice ages) over thousands of years.

'Before the transition, the period of variation was about 41,000 years while afterwards it became 100,000 years. The reason for this change is not known.'

Using tried and tested techniques, the scientists plan to drill deep into the shelf to access the oldest layers of ice.

Professor Fischer said: 'Ice cores contain little air bubbles and thus represent the only direct archive of the composition of the past atmosphere.

A previous expedition in 2003 managed to extract ice 800,000 years old at a site called Dome C, but Professor Fischer and colleagues hope to nearly double that in the near future. The deeper scientists drill into the ice, the more difficult it gets to retrieve an accurate sample. The beginnings of a bore hole in ice is pictured

'The information on greenhouse-gas concentrations at that time can only be gained from an Antarctic ice core covering the last 1.5 million years

'Such an ice core does not exist yet, but ice of that age should be in principle hidden in the Antarctic ice sheet.'

A previous expedition in 2003 managed to extract ice 800,000 years old at a site called Dome C, but Professor Fischer and colleagues hope to nearly double that in the near future.

However, the deeper scientists drill into the ice, the more difficult it gets to retrieve an accurate sample.

Professor Fischer explained: 'If the ice thickness is too high, the old ice at the bottom is getting so warm by geothermal heating that it is melted away.

'This is what happens at Dome C and limits its age to 800,000 years.'

Scientists are planning an expedition to Antarctica (pictured) in three to five year's time. They are currently focusing on raising funding for the trip which could cost around £40million, and working out where to drill to collect the ice core

Furthermore, horizontal movement in the ice can cause the very bottom annual layers to mix up.

In their search to find the ideal site, Professor Fischer and his team at the university, combined data to identify possible drill sites.

Eric Wolff, co-author of the study which is published in Climate of the Past, of the British Antarctic Survey, said: 'To constrain the possible locations where such 1.5 million-year old - and in terms of its layering undisturbed - ice could be found in Antarctica, we compiled the available data on climate and ice conditions in the Antarctic and used a simple ice and heat flow model to locate larger areas where such old ice may exist.'

The team plan to survey the sites on the ground before choosing their deep drill location.

Professor Fischer said: 'A deep drilling project in Antarctica could commence within the next 3-5 years.

'This time would also be needed to plan the drilling logistically and create the funding for such an exciting large-scale international research project, which would cost around 50 million Euros.'
