Health sensors and devices can get better if rival companies work together, Samsung has claimed as it revealed a new smart wristband.

The Korean giant revealed a plan to allow manufacturers to use the same core components - much like the mobile phone market.

It also revealed an online service to track the data - just days before Apple is expected to reveal its 'Healthbook' app for the iPhone.

Last night, Samsung revealed a new smart wristband and announced plans to let manufacturers use the same core components - much like the mobile phone market. Ram Fish, Vice President of Digital Health for Samsung is pictured displaying the Simband

Although a full set of features has not been released, Samsung said the gadget would read:

heart rate

blood flow

respiration

galvanic skin response

hydration

gas and glucose concentrations blood

substances carried in the surrounding air

'There is a tremendous opportunity at the intersection of health and technology,' said Young Sohn, president and chief strategy officer for Samsung Electronics’ Device Solutions.

'This is the single greatest opportunity of our generation.

'This is a big enough challenge—we cannot do it alone, we have to do it with partners.'

Samsung expects to make 'beta' test versions of its Simband wristband and SAMI data service later this year. It has been partnering with scientists from the University of California, San Francisco and other institutions to test its devices and offer suggestions.

The system would also include ways to exchange and analyze data.

Samsung believes that could help detect heart problems and other medical conditions sooner.

Third-party app developers could also tap that data, with a user's permission, to recommend exercise and diets, for instance.

Samsung presented its vision for wearable devices at a San Francisco event ahead of next week's developers conference by rival Apple.

There is widespread speculation that Apple has been working on wearable devices, and its products tend to use proprietary technologies.

However, an open system would be a departure for Samsung as well.

Its Gear wristwatches and fitness devices currently work only with Samsung phones.

Smartwatches from Sony and other manufacturers tend to work with a wider range of Android phones.

Young Sohn, Samsung's president and chief strategy officer, described the Gear devices as a second-generation product.

The first generation consisted of fitness-tracking apps downloaded on smartphones.

Future devices, he said, would be able to collect more vital signs and send you to a doctor before you get symptoms.

Set to be called Healthbook  the app is expected to be included in a new version of Apple's iOS software that will launch alongside its health-tracking wristband.

He compared them to cars embedded with sensors to warn you of low air pressure and other troubles.

Samsung is also trying to improve usability by allowing users to recharge the Simband while wearing it.

With current devices, users typically have to remove their devices for recharging every few days.
