Our homes could soon be powered by floating generators that double up as mobile phone masts.

Massachusetts-based Altaeros Energies has teamed up with the Alaska Energy Authority to power homes across the northwest state using its Buoyant Airborne Turbine (BAT).

The BAT is a wind generator that sits at altitudes of 1,000ft (305m) - where gusts are stronger and more consistent - and is capable of reducing energy costs by up to 65 per cent.

The BAT is a wind generator that sits at
 1,000ft (305m) - where gusts are stronger and more consistent.

Altaeros claims that at these altitudes, winds are between five and eight times stronger than 
those harvested by tower turbines.

This equates to a 65 per cent saving on energy costs, and reduces installation time from weeks to days.

The BAT uses a helium-filled, inflatable shell to lift to high altitudes.

High-strength chains hold the BAT steady while also being used to transfer the electricity created back to the ground. 

The BAT's lifting technology is adapted from aerostats - industrial cousins of the blimp.

Altaeros designed the BAT to offer 'consistent, low-cost energy for the remote power market, including remote and island communities; oil and gas, mining, agriculture, and telecommunication firms; disaster relief organisations; and military bases.'

The Alaska project will be the first commercial use of the technology and will be used to test how effective it is, and how much it costs.

Altaeros Energies has been developing the technology for the past four years and announced in March 2012 it successfully generated energy from 350ft (106m) with an automated prototype of its airborne wind turbine.

It lifted a top-selling turbine to produce over twice the power at high altitude than generated at conventional tower height and landed again in an automated cycle.

The turbine was successfully transported and deployed into the air at Loring Commerce Center in Limestone, Maine, from a towable docking trailer.

The BAT is designed to have 'virtually no environmental or noise impact' and requires minimal maintenance.

The company continued that the Altaeros will displace expensive fuel used to power diesel generators at remote industrial, military, and village sites.

In the long term, Altaeros plans to scale up the technology to reduce costs in the offshore wind market.

‘For decades, wind turbines have required cranes and huge towers to lift a few hundred feet off the ground where winds can be slow and gusty,’ explained Ben Glass, Altaeros' chief executive officer.

‘We are excited to demonstrate that modern inflatable materials can lift wind turbines into more powerful winds almost everywhere - with a platform that is cost competitive and easy to setup from a shipping container.’

This reduces energy costs by up to 65 per cent, claim the company
