Chelsea target Douglas Costa has revealed he wants to play under Jose Mourinho and believes the Blues boss would aid his progress as a player.

The current Premier League leaders have increased their offer for the Shakhtar Donetsk midfielder to £18.7million having had an opening bid of £16million rejected on Thursday evening, according to the player himself.

However, Costa claims the Ukranian champions have said they will help him after he made clear his desire to move to Stamford Bridge.

Speaking to GloboESporte.com, the 24-year-old spoke of his desire to play under Mourinho at Chelsea and said: 'To play at Chelsea is a dream for any player. It is standing next to some of the best players in the world and competing with the world's best as well.

'But really, what catches my eye is the coach. He is a very intelligent coach and has been victorious wherever he went. One of the things that would make me happier to act at Chelsea would be this.

Having spent five years in Donetsk under Shakhtar boss Mircea Lucescu, Costa believes Mourinho could take his game to the next level.

'I learned a lot here with Lucesc,' said the Brazil international. 'I arrived at Shakhtar aged 19 and he taught me a lot. I am very grateful. But I also know that with Mourinho at Chelsea, my progress would be even greater.

'He has won just about everything. He is among the best, if not the best. He is at the top.'  

The midfielder attracted the interest of Chelsea and Manchester United as a teenager at Brazilian side Gremio before moving to Shakhtar in a £4.5m deal.
