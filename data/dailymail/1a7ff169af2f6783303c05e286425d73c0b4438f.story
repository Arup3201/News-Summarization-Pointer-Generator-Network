A man has died after jumping from a burning building in Brooklyn last night after flames blocked his only route of escaping the fire.

Hundreds of firefighters tackled the blaze which ripped through a hardware store and a set of apartments in Prospect Heights.

Police say the fire broke out just before 3.40am at the four-story building on Flatbush Avenue.

Among those injured were two police officers who suffered smoke inhalation, a person left critically injured, two with serious burns and two others that suffered minor injuries, NBC New York reported.

The street was closed as more than 160 firefighters from 39 units tackled the fire and helped evacuate residents, while 30 people were left displaced by the raging fire.

The man who died when he leapt from the building owned a deli in the area and was on the floor above the hardware store when the fire broke out, it was reported.

Struggling to reach the fire escape due to thick smoke and huge flames, he decided the best option was to jump, his sister-in-law said.

'He tried to get out from the fire escape, the flames were too big,' she told the New York Daily News.

Christopher Nation, the owner of Flatbush Hardware, told the paper he woke up, looked out his window and saw his business on fire.

The 48-year-old said: 'I woke up and I saw smoke and heard the screaming.'
