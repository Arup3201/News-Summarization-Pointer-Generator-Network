Holidaymakers who have always wanted to live in one of Oxford's historic colleges now have their chance. 

The oldest university in Britain's Keble College has opened up more than 300 rooms as B&Bs for people who want to relax in the dreaming city of spires.

Tourists will be in good company as the university  has welcomed presidents, statesmen and royalty into its hallowed halls.

In common with many other universities across the UK, holidaymakers can book a room for the summer holiday season when the students are away.

And if they don't mind being surrounded by centuries-old, dust-covered books and paintings of long-dead dons, they won't have to pay a king's ransom to stay the night.

Guests can use the facilities at Keble College, coming down for breakfast in the magnificent dining hall and retiring for the night in beds in the student lodgings. 

A single ensuite room with a view of the quad costs £65 a night and a double with a similar view is £95. Guests get bed-and-breakfast, internet access, and access to the college bar.

Visitors can also dine in the dining hall on evenings at 7pm prompt at a cost of £22 per head.

And who knows, tourists could find themselves lying in the same bed as famous Keble College alumni former president of the United States Ronald Reagan, former international cricketer Imran Khan or Shadow Chancellor, Ed Balls.

Keble College's domestic bursar Nick French said: 'We will always be delighted to welcome visitors who want to come and explore Oxford and enjoy its historic surroundings.'

The city has a wealth of attractions on offer including punting on the River Cherwell, wandering around the Oxford University Museum of Natural History or just marvelling at the ancient architecture.

University rooms spokeswoman Angela Southall said: 'Staying in an Oxford university in the summer is one of the UK's best-kept secrets.

'Stay in historic, culturally fascinating surroundings, meet some of the most interesting people you'll ever meet and all for a fraction of the cost of a hotel.'

Unis around the country are largely left empty during holiday times and rent out spare rooms with views ranging from the world-famous architecture of Oxford and Cambridge, the attractions of big cities like London and Newcastle to the more rural surroundings of Lancaster.

Some universities do not have a central system for reserving rooms so visitors might have to go to the colleges direct or book through the institution's conference centre.
