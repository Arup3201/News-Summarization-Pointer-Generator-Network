More often associated with armed robbers than trend- setters, the balaclava is experiencing an unlikely revival.

Several designers have produced luxury versions, including Louis Vuitton and Chanel, whose balaclava features the label’s famous double ‘C’ logo.

The trend has found a host of celebrity fans — perhaps balaclavas come in handy when dodging fans.

Singer Beyonce was spotted leaving a recording studio in LA in a Louis Vuitton number which showed only her (elaborately made-up) eyes.

And both model Cara Delevingne and One Direction’s Harry Styles have been seen wearing balaclavas made by streetwear label Black Score.

Lily Cole was spotted completely obscured by hers and Justin Bieber tweeted a photo of himself in the Chanel version.

It’s a long way from the balaclava’s origin as a garment to protect British troops from the cold during the Crimean War of the 1850s.

Then, hundreds of knitted balaclavas were sent over from the UK. They came to be known as ‘balaclava helmets’, after the Crimean town of Balaklava.
