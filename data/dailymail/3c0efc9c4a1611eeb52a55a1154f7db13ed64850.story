The Co-op Group has today revealed catastrophic losses of £2.5billion for the past year.

Acting chief executive Richard Pennycook made a stark warning about the mutual's future and admitted: '2013 was a disastrous year, the worst in our 150-year history'.

He added: 'This is a wake-up call that the Co-op does not have a God-given right to exist.'

The monumental losses follow the near-collapse of its banking arm, which had a £1.5billion black hole in its finances and nearly sank the whole group, which employs 90,000 staff in the UK.

It came a day after the Co-op Bank's former chairman Reverend Paul Flowers was charged with drugs offences.

In trouble: The Co-op group, which owns 30 per cent of the ailing Co-op Bank, has posted losses of £2.5billion - branded the worst year in its 150-year history

The group's losses were £2.5billion in the last year, up from £529million in 2012.

Last month chief executive Euan Sutherland quit the vast group, which has funeral, pharmacy, insurance, banking and a supermarket among its businesses, calling it a 'ungovernable'. 

His acting replacement Richard Pennycook said as he revealed the vast losses: 'Today’s results demonstrate that but 
they also highlight fundamental failings in management and governance at
 the Group over many years.

'These results should serve as a wake-up call
 to anyone who doubts just how serious the challenges we face are'.

Former City minister Lord Myners, who 
resigned from the group's board last week, has blamed former managers 'who were allowed to run amok 
like kids in a sweet shop'.

He was brought in to draw up proposals for a 
major overhaul of the business, but this was rejected. They may now be pushed through next month.

'They bought up 
businesses willy-nilly - from Britannia Building Society to Somerfield 
supermarkets - and made catastrophically inept decisions over and over 
again. In the process they crippled the group with huge debt,' he said in the Daily Mirror. 

Criticism: Experts have said the group, which includes the supermarket, is too big to led to safety by the current management

The bulk of the losses relate to the crisis that engulfed the Co-op's banking arm when a £1.5 billion hole was discovered in its finances, following its ill-fated purchase of the Britannia building society and attempts to buy more than 600 Lloyds branches.

A rescue deal means the majority of the bank is now owned by bondholders though the Co-op group remains the largest single shareholder with 30 per cent.

But this stake may be further diluted after it said in today's statement that it had still not decided whether to take part in a £400 million rights issue after the lender said it needed to find more cash than previously thought.

The group said the cash call was an 'opportunity, not an obligation' and that it would 'consider the full details of the issue in due course'.

It will add to speculation about the possibility of the size of the group's holding in the bank falling to such a low level that it may not be able to continue operating under the Co-operative brand.

Roger Barker, director of corporate governance at the Institute of Directors said: 'The Co-operative Group’s problems have not arisen because Co-op is a mutual organisation. They have arisen because Co-op has weak corporate governance.

'Without major changes to its governance model, the Co-operative Group will struggle to survive over the medium term. This is a huge concern for the 90,000 people employed by the Group'.

One of its former bosses, disgraced reverend Paul Flowers, was yesterday charged with three drugs offences.

The man dubbed the ‘Crystal Methodist', is accused of possession of Class A drugs cocaine and methamphetamine as well as the Class C drug ketamine.

Arriving at a police station to answer bail, he told the assembled reporters and photographers that they were ‘vultures’.

But said the exception was the BBC – which had always been ‘really nice’ to him.

Today's figures showed the Co-op's vast debt pile, built up during an acquisition spree which included the Somerfield supermarket chain, stood at £1.4 billion.

This was down from £1.7billion in 2012, but comes as lenders are reported to be increasingly troubled by the run of boardroom disputes hampering plans to shake up the group's corporate structure.

Bitter resistance to the planned changes saw chief executive Euan Sutherland step down last month while former

City minister Lord Myners, architect of the reforms, will also leave after putting them to a members' vote in May.

Group chair Ursula Lidbetter used today's results announcement to stress the urgent need for change.

'During 2013, it became apparent that our governance had fallen far short of the standards to which we aspire as a co-operative society.

'Now is the time to put that right through fundamental reform - we have to act with urgency if we are to lay the foundations for a stronger, healthier co-operative business in the future.'
