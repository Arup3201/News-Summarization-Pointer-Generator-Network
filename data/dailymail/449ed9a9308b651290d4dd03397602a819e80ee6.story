A depraved criminal reportedly beat and strangled his 90-year-old grandmother one day after he was released from prison.

Darel Agerton, 38, of Joliet, Illinois, was taken into custody on Wednesday afternoon for the November 30 death of Veronica Schick, whose unconscious body was found on the floor of her home.

Agerton was staying at Schick's home at the time of his grandmother's death.

Agerton dialed 911 for an ambulance and police were called in to assist after paramedics arrived at the home, a local Patch site reports.

Agerton told the emergency responders that he awoke from a nap to find his grandmother unresponsive and laying on the floor, according to a release from the local sheriff's office.

When investigators called Agerton in for questioning, he made statements that were inconsistent with his original story, the release says.

Undisclosed physical evidence was also allegedly found at the scene.

‘It was very suspicious,’ Will County sheriff's spokesman Ken Kaupas was quoted as saying.

Prosecutors say Agerton beat his grandmother with his hands and feet and strangled her in her home.

No information on a possible motive has been released.

Agerton remains jailed on a $5 million bond and faces six counts of first-degree murder.

Will County Circuit Judge Marzell Richardson upheld the bond after a public defender requested it be lowered.

Agerton was released from the Illinois Department of Corrections on November 29 after serving 15 months in jail for his fourth DUI conviction.

His deceased grandmother was a mechanic in World War II with the Women’s Army Corps, serving with a motor pool in the Pacific Theater, according to local news station 89 WLS.
