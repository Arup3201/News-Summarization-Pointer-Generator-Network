What could possibly be more fabulous than a Christmas party hosted by Lady Gaga and legendary crooner Tony Bennett? Very little if H&M's new Christmas advert is anything to go by.

In the new release entitled, 'Magical Holidays,' Gaga and Tony perform, 'It Don’t Mean A Thing (If It Ain’t Got That Swing)' as a host of beautiful models enjoy a glamorous 1940's style bash.

The famous pair also feature in some gorgeous stills released by the retail giant who have utilised Gaga and Bennett's considerable pulling power top promote their Christmas campaign.

Firm friends: Lady Gaga and Tony Bennett star together in the H&M Christmas campaign. They have become firm friends since releasing an album together earlier this year

John Renck, director of the commercial said: 'We were inspired by the glitz, glamour, and opulence of the 1940's Big Band era.

'The mood is one of festive celebration shot through with a strong sense of fashion and an underlying humour. It is intriguing, curious, exuberant, audacious, and filled with wonder.'

In the ad 28-year-old Gaga wears a dazzling green dress, offsetting huge dark,curly hair.

Ann-Sofie Johansson H&M's Head of Design, New Development said: 'I love the feeling of celebration at H&M this holiday season.

'Women's dresses sparkle or give a new twist to traditional red, while men look festive in different plaids, and kids in all their different fun prints.'

For Gaga and Bennett this isn't their first time working together. The singers released a jazz album named Cheek to Cheek in September.

Tony, 85, speaks highly of the 'You and I' singer and said in a previous interview: 'I’ll tell you, I never met anyone with more talent than that lady.'

Whilst Gaga has revealed that despite their differences in age and appearance Tony has been able to see past her, often outlandish, outfits. 

She said, 'I suppose some people can't see through my clothes, but people like Tony can.'
