Hundreds of protesters today descended on the BBC's Scottish headquarters in protest at its alleged bias in covering the independence referendum.

A huge crowd of people, many with flags or banners, could be seen outside the Corporation's studios in Glasgow following a march from the city centre.

First Minister Alex Salmond has previously accused the BBC of colluding with the Westminster Government in a bid to undermine the independence movement ahead of Thursday's vote.

Protest: Hundreds of people have descended on BBC Scotland to demonstrate over their alleged bias

Anger: Scottish nationalists believe the BBC has given a one-sided view of the debate

In a new interview, he added that London-based journalists had been unable to 'separate their own view of the world from their view reporting Scotland'.

Today Yes supporters gathered in the centre of Glasgow and proceeded to march on the BBC's headquarters.

Pictures posted online showed hundreds  of people outside the studio, many with enormous saltire flags - Police Scotland estimated that up to 1,000 people were in attendance.

Banners at the event described the BBC as the 'British Biased Corporation', with one placard saying the corporation was 'anti-democracy, anti-truth'.

A line of police could be seen outside the entrance to the building stopping protesters from going in.

Dean Toner, 20, from Uddingston in Lanarkshire, said at the demonstration: 'It's a protest against the biased reporting the BBC have been taking part in.

'It's been a completely one-sided street, there's not been any coverage, proper true coverage, of the Yes campaign and it's not good enough any more.' 

But No voters expressed anger at the event, claiming that it was an attempt at intimidating the media.

One unionist, Rhoda Macdonald, wrote on Twitter that the march was 'truly sinister', adding: 'I am ashamed of some of my fellow Scots.'

Blair McDougall, leader of the anti-independence Better Together, tweeted: 'Last Sunday before the vote. Doors to be knocked? No, let's do this instead.'

Particular anger has focussed on the BBC's political editor Nick Robinson, who was this week accused of 'heckling' Mr Salmond at a Press conference.

The fiery exchange came after the BBC reported that Royal Bank of Scotland was set to move its headquarters to London, quoting anonymous Government sources.

Asked by the Sunday Herald today whether he thought the BBC was biased, Mr Salmond said: 'Yes, absolutely. Of course it is. The problem with Nick... I mean, don't get me wrong, I like these folk, but they don't realise they're biased. It's the unconscious bias which is the most extraordinary thing of all.'

The First Minister added: 'I just think metropolitan BBC has found this whole thing extraordinarily difficult, to separate their own view of the world from their view reporting Scotland.'

Despite the animosity felt towards the BBC by many Scottish nationalists, Mr Salmond has previously insisted that an independent Scotland would be able to keep broadcasting the Corporation's programmes.

Clash: The BBC's political editor Nick Robinson had a fiery exchange with Alex Salmond earlier this week

The BBC said in a statement today: 'We believe our coverage has been fair and impartial and has adhered fully to the requirements of our Editorial and Referendum Guidelines.'

Labour MP Ian Davidson said: 'Yesterday it was the banks and some of the largest employers in Scotland. Today it's the BBC and MI5. In the world of Alex Salmond and his fellow nationalists, everybody is against them.

'If you aren't actively for them then you are against them. And if they think you are against them they go on the attack.'

Conservative MSP Alex Johnstone added: 'I can't understand on the last weekend of campaigning why so many Yes supporters would spend their time in this way.'
