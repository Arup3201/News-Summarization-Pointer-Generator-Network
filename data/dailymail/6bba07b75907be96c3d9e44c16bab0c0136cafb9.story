Almost a year ago in May 2013 the world’s first gun made with a 3D printer was unveiled.

At the time it sparked major controversy – some derided it as nothing more than a toy, others warned it was a serious security risk that was undetectable by metal detectors.

Now, one year on, the chilling reality of 3D-printed guns has been revealed as enthusiasts across the world show off their ‘toys’.

In May 2013 Cody Wilson showed off the world's first fully 3D-printed gun, known as the Liberator (pictured). Now, one year one, users of the online community Fosscad reveal to MailOnline how far the technology has progressed, and how dangerous it could become in the future

A multitude of videos on YouTube show just how 3D-printed guns have come in 12 months.

The first was unveiled by Cody Wilson, a 25-year-old law student at the University of Texas.

The Mail On Sunday exposed the international security risk posed by a gun that can be easily 
made with new 3D printers last year.

They built a weapon, which is capable of firing a live round, from 
blueprints available on the internet – then smuggled it on to a packed 
Eurostar train.

Two 
reporters passed completely unchallenged through strict airport-style 
security to carry the gun on to a London to Paris service in the weekend
 rush-hour, alongside hundreds of unsuspecting travellers.

The pistol, capable of firing a deadly 
0.38-calibre bullet, was produced in under 36 hours using a 
revolutionary £1,700 machine to ‘print’ its components. And because all 
the parts are plastic, they did not trigger the metal detectors all 
Euro-star passengers must pass through.

His primitive design was the Liberator – but that proof of concept has been vastly improved since May 2013.

3D-printing gun enthusiasts now gather at a website called Fosscad (Free Open Source Software & Computer Aided Designs).

Here, users share their designs for 3D-printed guns, which can be downloaded by anyone.

With a 3D printer, technically anyone can then download one of the designs and print their own gun.

MailOnline spoke to some of the users on Fosscad about how it has changed over the last year.

Some were keen to stress that these guns are not always that easy to make.

They require a decent knowledge of 3D printing and assembly.

And, it was pointed out that while most of the gun can be printed there are some things that cannot, such as ammo - although not for lack of trying.

But they did agree that these guns would be use to seriously harm and even kill people, just like regular guns - with the difference being the designs for 3D-printed guns can be downloaded from the internet.

For countries like the UK, where firearms are much harder to come by than in the US, the availability of these designs does prove a considerable danger.

In one Youtube video a Japanese 'Zig Zag' revolver, named by its maker, can be seen in action.

Yoshitomo Imura, the man behind the video, was recently arrested in Japan for owning 3D-printed firearm components.

This image shows how close the community is to making a machine gun with a barrel, as shown here, with a 3D-printer. 'Everything in blue can be 3D-printed,' says user Duce, although he does not know if the whole gun will ever be able to be printed

While guns can be 3D printed, the users say that getting ammo for them would be a lot more difficult. Efforts have been made to 3D print ammo, with limited success, but the guns themselves are developing at an astounding rate from simple contraptions to rifles and revolvers (pictured)

‘A big misconception is that 3D printing and making guns using 3D printers are easy to make,’ said one user, Duce, who goes as 'ma deuce' on Youtube.

‘We have been doing this for years and I can say it’s not easy.’

Duce points out that the group has been working on making 3D components for guns for about two years – it’s only in the past year almost entirely printed guns have been conceived.

‘In the UK you can’t buy gun parts easily,’ Duce says, ‘So you would be limited to the liberator type guns.’

For a complete novice who had no knowledge of 3D printers or guns it would take ‘probably a few months to do it well, to print it’ and then assemble the design into a weapon.

In the last year stronger designs have been devised for guns like the Liberator, while they also have higher capacity.

The first gun could hold just one bullet, but now some have revolving barrels that can hold six or more.

‘Let me be clear, in a few years our design will be excellent, we hope,’ says Duce. ‘That is the goal.’

At the moment however, according to another user called Shadowfall, ‘Someone could cause more harm with a hammer than with a Liberator.’

There are a number of 3D-printed gun designs now freely available on the web.

The first fully 3D-printed gun (save for the ammo), the Liberator, is capable of killing someone.

Before the Liberator initial efforts to make guns from plastic usually exploded when attempts were made to fire bullets.

This proof of concept gun, however, showed that making a lethal weapon out of plastic is entirely possible.

Since then a number of other guns have sprung up on the web.

In
 late 2013 a gun enthusiast in Wisconsin showed off a working firearm 
called the Lulz Liberator, made from less than £15 ($25) worth of 
plastic, that could fire .38 calibre bullets without being damaged.

In July, meanwhile, a Youtube user showed off ‘The Grizzly, a 3D-printed rifle capable of firing .22-calibre bullets.

These
 guns were one-shot only – the barrel had to be removed after each shot –
 but in August another gun enthusiast unveiled the Reprringer, capable 
of holding and firing five bullets.

The
 alarming speed at which the technology has progressed shows how close 
these guns are to accurately mimicking real-life weapons.

Even as users of Fosscod play down the danger of them, the sight of guns made from plastic being created is unnerving.

And the fact they are made of plastic and not metal means they can be taken through metal detectors without being picked up.

For the moment, though, ammo and firing pins must still be metal.

But there is a possibility that in future entire guns could be 3D-printed - including the ammo.

Designs for 3D-printed guns, like the Reprringer seen here, can quite easily be downloaded by anybody from popular sites like Fosscad. However, the users of the site maintain that actually making the guns and using a 3D-printer is not as easy as it looks, although it is possible for someone to become an expert in a few months

Over the past year the various designs have increased in their complexity and performance. The next 12 months could see them get even better until they are on a par with real guns, according to users on the site

3D printed guns jumped to the top of agendas worldwide when governments realised they could be taken through metal detectors without setting them off.

The users point out that the guns need a metal firing pin and ammo, however, which would set a metal detector off.

But they seem almost nonchalant about the potential dangers of these weapons, with a genuine enthusiasm for making them.

‘I’m not in it for the fame, I just love guns and the art of designing them,’ says Duce.

And on the availability of the designs for someone to print a gun, Duce says: ‘If I put a gun on the table in front of you would you pick it up and shoot me?’

Since a year ago the community has a lot more parts and working types of guns, and the users see this continuing for the next year.

For now, though, the guns are still in their relative infancy and the designs have yet to be perfected.

But will a 3D printed gun ever be as powerful as a real gun?

'Definitely,' says Duce.
