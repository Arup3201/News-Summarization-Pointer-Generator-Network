The guest list was certainly eclectic. But some mourners had no difficulty standing out from the crowd.

Namely classical singer Katherine Jenkins, who seemed determined to show off her curves in a plunging cocktail-style dress and flared overcoat.

The 32-year-old mezzo-soprano, who is thought to have met Baroness Thatcher through their charity work for the Armed Forces, sparked outrage on Twitter from users who thought the dress was inappropriate for the stately occasion.

Clothing choice: The singer sparked comment on Twitter from users who thought the dress was inappropriate 

AngelaReedFox, said: ‘Just for a change, or perhaps in honour of the occasion, Katherine Jenkins could have put her cleavage away.’

Hilary McGowan said she was ‘not sure Katherine Jenkins’s cleavage is appropriate’.

Another Twitter user going by the name WellWilk added: ‘I think Katherine Jenkins could have put her cleavage away for just one day #thatcherfuneral.’

Fortunately from the neck upwards, Miss Jenkins, a favourite of the Royal family who has lunched privately with the Queen, was the epitome of elegance in a black Philip Treacy pillbox hat with netting.
