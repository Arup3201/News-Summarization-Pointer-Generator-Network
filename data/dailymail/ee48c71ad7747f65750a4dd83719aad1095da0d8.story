A sheep which was rescued after being hit by a car and brought up with three puppies is now convinced he is a dog.

Thirteen-month-old Lamo is so sure he is a canine, he fetches sticks and balls, wears a collar and a lead, jumps up on his hind legs - and even tries to bark.

Lamo does not even recognise his own kind, preferring to chase rabbits instead.

Sheepdog? Lamo the sheep thinks he's a dog and likes to go for walkies. He is pictured with owner Jennifer Jones and Poppy the Labrador cross

Fetch boy! Thirteen-month-old Lamo was taken in by Ms Jones, who runs Rockfield Animal Rescue in Wentnor, Shropshire, after he was run over by a motorist last February

Barking: Jennifer Jones fed Lamo milk and brought him up with her three dogs - a Staffordshire Bull Terrier called Wallace, Judy the Jack Russell, and Poppy

Owner Jennifer Jones, 45, who runs Rockfield Animal Rescue in Wentnor, Shropshire, took Lamo in when he was run over by a motorist last February.

The mother-of-four fed Lamo milk and brought him up with her three dogs - a Staffordshire Bull Terrier called Wallace, Judy the Jack Russell cross, and a Labrador named Poppy.

She said: 'Lamo was given to me as a terrified little lamb and we have no idea where he came from.

'There's a farm nearby but the farmer said it couldn't be his.

'I raised him with my three dogs, so now he thinks he's one of them.

It's a dog's life: Lamo with Judy the Jack Russell cross. He prefers the company of humans rather than sheep

'Most sheep do revert to their natural characteristics if they are not brought up in their natural surroundings but clearly Lamo prefers life as a dog,' said vet David Howell

Woolly jumper: Lamo joined the Joneses when he was a terrified lamb. It is not known where he came from

'He really is wonderful. He follows us around everywhere and is always under our feet.

'He doesn't care about the other sheep - he prefers humans. He's always trying to get our attention and is constantly getting up to mischief.'

Ms Jones also takes Lamo round to her friends' houses to mow their lawn by chewing the grass and puts him on a lead to take him for walks at the weekend.

Incredibly, the sheep also enjoys going for a quick doggy-paddle in the local lake.

Baa-rk: Ms Jones said Lamo is always trying to get her attention and is constantly getting up to mischief

And everywhere that Ms Jones went... her Lamo was sure to go

She added: 'He gets really excited when we take him out in the van for a walk down the country lanes.

'He wriggles around and starts screwing his nose up

'When we swing open the back doors, he's standing there panting and looking really pleased with himself.

'He loves a little swim now and again too - it's quite amazing to see him dive in for a quick dip.'

Vet David Howell said: 'Sheep are more intelligent than some people think and they are very capable of learned behaviour.

'Most sheep do revert to their natural characteristics if they are not brought up in their natural surroundings but clearly Lamo prefers life as a dog.'

Dog tired? Then hitch a ride! Lamo gets very excited at the prospect of walks down country lanes
