A lottery winner who separated from his wife after scooping a £148million jackpot has become close to a former sausage factory worker, it has been revealed.

Adrian Bayford, 43, has developed a ‘friendly relationship’ with Polish-born Marta Jarosz, 30, since moving out of the £6million Cambridgeshire estate he bought with his wife  Gillian, 41.

The couple revealed in November that their marriage had ‘broken down irretrievably’ 15 months after scooping Britain’s second biggest lottery prize.

Adrian Bayford - who split up from his wife Gillian three months ago, 15 months after their Lotto win - has started a 'friendly relationship' with Mart Jarosz, 30, pictured, it has been reported

The fitness fanatic lives in a small terraced house close to his luxury home, and is said to have become close to Mr Bayford since his split from his wife

Mr Bayford – who actually bought the 
winning EuroMillions ticket – blamed the stresses that their massive 
jackpot brought for the collapse of their nine-year marriage.

But 
Miss Jarosz is now said to have become a regular visitor to Mr Bayford’s
 new house and has been seen driving a £34,000 Volvo V40 hatchback. The 
vehicle is thought to be a gift from the father-of-two – who cannot 
drive.

Last night Mr Bayford’s best friend and former business 
partner Richard Hudspith said the couple, who have known each other ‘for
 a while’, have struck up a ‘friendly relationship’.

He told the Mail that Mr Bayford and Miss Jarosz were both away but would not say whether they were on holiday together.

Miss
 Jarosz, who lives in a terraced home close to Mr Bayford’s new £500,000
 property in Haverhill, Suffolk, works as a nightclub bouncer and is 
thought to have met him while he was on a night out.

It is believed the pair met when Ms Jarosz was working as a bouncer at a local nightspot and Mr Bayford was on a night out with friends

After scooping one of the biggest Lottery prizes ever to be won in England the Bayford's vowed the money wouldn't change them 

Her online CV shows
 that she used to work as an employee coordinator at sausage supplier 
Dalehead Foods in Linton, Cambridgeshire.

She studied at the High 
School of Economics in Poland for four years becoming moving to Britain.

Her Facebook profile suggests that she is a fitness fanatic and images 
show her kick-boxing in black shorts as well as in her bikini on 
holiday.

Neither Mr Bayford and Miss Jarosz were last night 
available for comment. The Bayfords won their £148million Euromillions 
jackpot in August 2012, putting them 516th on Britain’s rich list.

They 
moved into a Grade II listed Georgian mansion in Linton before 
announcing late last year that they had separated and he had moved out.

Mr
 Bayford told the Mail at the time: ‘Gillian and I have split. When you 
win the lottery it’s so stressful. Things happen. Sometimes in life you 
have to move on. We’re all happy now and life goes on.’

According to her Linkedin profile Mr Jarosz worked as an 'employee co-ordinator' at Dalehead Foods in Linton, Cambridgeshire - a sausage supplier

They strenuously
 denied that anyone else was involved and Mrs Bayford brushed off 
rumours that she had become close to their bodybuilding groundsman Chris
 Tovey, 40.

He worked for the couple until he claimed he was hit by a
 golf buggy driven by Mr Bayford on their 200-acre estate and is now 
thought to be taking legal action against them.

In December, it was 
reported that Mrs Bayford was in a relationship with car dealer Alan 
Warnock, who sold her some of her fleet of cars.

They met in October 
last year, when the Bayfords visited Gillian’s parents in Scotland – and
 were sold five luxury vehicles at an Audi dealership by Mr Warnock.

Mrs
 Bayford, a former hospital healthcare worker in Cambridge, is now 
thought to have set up home with the sales manager in an exclusive 
estate in her home town of Dundee.
