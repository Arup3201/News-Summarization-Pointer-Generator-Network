Liverpool footballer Luis Suarez has been banned for eight matches and fined £40,000 after being found guilty of racially abusing an opponent.

The footballer abused Manchester United defender Patrice Evra during a match at Liverpool's Anfield ground on October 15.

Evra claimed the Uruguayan player used abusive language towards him on 10 occasions during the game.

Abused: Luis Suarez has been found to have used racist language towards Manchester United's Patrice Evra during a league match. He has been banned for eight games and fined £40,000

Suarez is expected to appeal against the decision with the suspension not starting until after it has concluded.

The football association said in a statement: 'An Independent Regulatory Commission has today found a charge of misconduct against Luis Suarez proven, and have issued a suspension for a period of eight matches as well as fining him £40,000, pending appeal.'

The commission's ruling stated: 'Mr Suarez used insulting words towards Mr Evra during the match contrary to FA Rule E3(1).

'The insulting words used by Mr Suarez included a reference to Mr Evra's colour within the meaning of Rule E3(2).'

The statement added: 'Mr Suarez has the right to appeal the decision of the Independent Regulatory Commission to an Appeal Board. An appeal must be lodged within 14 days of the date of the written reasons for the decision.'

Suarez has strongly denied any accusations and was fully supported by his club.

Speaking earlier this month he said: 'There is no evidence I said anything
racist to him. I said nothing of the sort.

'There were two parts of the discussion - one in Spanish, one in 
English. I did not insult him. It was just a way of expressing myself. I
called him something his team-mates at Manchester call him, and even 
they were surprised by his reaction.'

Evra made his claims of racism immediately after the match at Anfield two months ago, telling French TV station Canal Plus that Suarez had used a racist insult to him 'at least 10 times'.

Evra said: 'There are cameras. You can see him (Suarez) say a certain word to me at least 10 times.'

Both players spoke to FA officials during the investigation and Suarez's defence was based on claims that he was unaware language that is acceptable in Uruguay is viewed as racist in Europe.
