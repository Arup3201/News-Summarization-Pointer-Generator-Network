Charged: Justin Ross Harris, 33, pictured, was supposed to drop his toddler, identified in reports as Cooper, to daycare around 9 a.m. Wednesday but instead went straight to work, apparently forgetting the boy was strapped in his carseat in the back of the vehicle

A father has been charged with murder and cruelty to children in the first degree after he left his 22-month-old son in a hot car all day, ultimately killing him.

Justin Ross Harris, 33, was supposed to drop his toddler, identified in reports as Cooper, to daycare around 9 a.m. Wednesday but instead went straight to work, apparently forgetting the boy was strapped in his carseat in the back of the vehicle.

It wasn't until 4 p.m., when he was driving home, that he noticed his son was lifeless in the back seat.

He pulled over the SUV at the Akers Mill Square shopping center on Cobb Parkway and tried to perform CPR on the boy but it was too late.

A witness, Dale Hamilton, said told CBS46 he saw the distraught father pull the child out of the car and attempt to resuscitate him.

'He was constantly saying, "What have I done, what have I done?"' Hamilton said.

Police added that he had to be restrained at the scene because he was so upset.

The child was pronounced dead at the scene.

Harris is being held without bond in the Cobb County Jail.

The high temperature in Atlanta was 91 degrees Wednesday.

A police warrant states Harris, who goes by Ross and works at Home Depot, admitted he left the 22-month-old unattended and strapped into his child car seat in the parked vehicle for approximately seven hours during the day before finding him unresponsive.

'It's just a terrible, God-awful situation,' Cobb County District Attorney Vic Reynolds told the Atlanta Journal-Constitution.

'I can't 
imagine, I can't fathom what any parent would be going through at this 
stage. It's the type of case that affects the community.'

An autopsy
 will be conducted by the Cobb County Medical Examiner's Office to 
determine the cause of death for the child, police said.

Harris, a Tuscaloosa, Alabama, native, had been working at Home Depot for just over two years.

Harris, his wife and Cooper were renting a condo off Terrell Mill Road, but hoped to buy a home, their landlord, Joe Saini, told the news website.

He described Harris and his wife as 'very, very nice' people who loved her son dealy.

'Everything was going right for this couple,' Saini said. 'They wanted to buy a house so they could have some space for their child to run around the backyard.'
