Suarez's future at adidas

Suarez's incredible 39 games banned for his THREE bites on opposition

Luis Suarez fans flocked to Carrasco International Airport near Montevideo to greet the arrival of the banned striker back in Uruguay.

Having been handed a nine-game international ban and four-month suspension from all football, Suarez travelled back to Uruguay and left the World Cup squad.

Supporters turned out in force to greet the Liverpool striker in Uruguay, with some wearing masks in tribute to their star man.

Uruguayan President Jose Mujica was at the international airport at one point, but returned home because Suarez's flight was delayed.

Because of the delay, the crowd of about 1,000 fans were moved from the airport terminal to an adjacent air force base to await Suarez's arrival.

Suarez was earlier seen with the rest of the team in Rio as they were pictured arriving at their hotel.

Uruguay face Colombia in an all South American last 16 clash, but they will have to make do without Suarez for that game and the rest of the tournament.

The
 Uruguayan Football Association are preparing an appeal against the 
severity of the sentence, which also includes a £64,000 fine. But there 
is no chance of Suarez appearing at Brazil 2014 again and his future at 
Liverpool is also plunged into uncertainty through the length of the 
suspension.

FIFA’s strict 
regulations barring him from any involvement in football mean he cannot 
even watch Liverpool or Uruguay in action — he is banned from football 
stadiums and must train alone away from Liverpool’s Melwood training 
ground.

Suarez can be sold 
during his spell in football exile — a strong possibility — but cannot 
personally join in negotiations in mooted moves to Barcelona or Real 
Madrid.

Liverpool are taking
 specialist legal advice before deciding what to do about Suarez — a 
world-class footballer who comes with more baggage than any other elite 
star. Given the length of his ban, Liverpool, who have not been 
contacted by FIFA or the Uruguay FA, feel aggrieved to be punished for 
something in which they had no part. The news was greeted with dismay by
 the club’s owners in Boston.

Uruguay
 FA president Wilmar Valdez said: ‘We are preparing our appeal to 
present to FIFA in the next few hours. It’s an extremely excessive 
punishment, there was not enough evidence and I have seen more 
aggressive incidents. It feels like Uruguay have been thrown out of the 
World Cup. We all know what Suarez means to Uruguay and to football 
around the world. Luis will travel home to recover with his family.’

Following
 this third, high-profile biting incident, it is no surprise that 
Suarez’s major sponsor adidas are thinking of ditching him. He has 
already been punished for racially abusing Patrice Evra and biting 
Branislav Ivanovic.

A 
statement said: ‘Adidas does not condone Luis Suarez’s recent behaviour 
and we will again be reminding him of the high standards we expect from 
our players. We have no plan to use Suarez for any additional marketing 
activities during the World Cup. We will discuss all aspects of our 
future partnership directly with Suarez and his team after the 
tournament.’

Another of 
Suarez’s backers, 888poker, are likely to drop him, with a spokesman 
saying: ‘888poker is seriously reviewing its relationship with the 
player as we will not tolerate unsporting behaviour.’

The
 independent FIFA disciplinary committee, chaired by  Claudio Sulser of 
Switzerland, reached the decision to hand  Suarez a World Cup record ban
 after 10 hours of talks spread over Wednesday night and Thursday 
morning before it was announced at FIFA’s daily briefing at the 
Maracana. The player and the Uruguay FA had been informed minutes 
beforehand. The suspension starts with immediate effect.

The
 committee took into account that this was the third time Suarez had 
bitten an opponent. His first victim was PSV Eindhoven’s Otman Bakkal in
 2010, for which he received a seven-match ban, and then Chelsea’s 
Ivanovic in 2013, which brought a 10-game ban.

Sulser
 said: ‘Such behaviour cannot be tolerated and in particular not at a 
World Cup when the eyes of millions are on the stars on the field. The 
disciplinary committee took into account all the factors of the case and
 the degree of Mr Suarez’s guilt in accordance with the relevant 
provisions of the code.’

The
 Uruguayan media claimed that Sulser’s committee had come under pressure
 from South American football chiefs, including the English-hating 
Argentinian football president Julio Grondona, not to punish Suarez too 
severely.

Kop that! Suarez will not be able to play for Liverpool until the end of October

Decision maker: Claudio Sulser said the incident 'could not be tolerated on any football pitch'

But FIFA insisted 
that there was no interference at all in the process. The world body’s 
president Sepp Blatter had been in Manaus watching Switzerland beat 
Honduras and  flew back to Rio while the Suarez hearing was going on. 
Meanwhile, the Football Writers’ Association, who made Suarez their 
player of the year last season, decided not to strip the Liverpool star 
of his title.

Uruguay face 
Colombia in the last 16 on Saturday Central defender Jose Maria Gimenez 
said the team were ‘more united than ever’, while the country’s sports 
minister Liliam Kechichian commented: ‘We are hurt by this excessive 
sanction. Now let’s see how we can help this human being and whether the
 group can show its class and its love for La Celeste.’

Britain’s
 FIFA vice-president Jim Boyce said: ‘The punishment is fully justified.
 Hopefully he will realise now that behaviour of this type will not be 
tolerated.’

Luis Suarez's bans for various bites now total 39 games.
