Christopher Gibson left a trail of cash leading to his house following an armed robbery at his local shop

As armed robbers go, this one isn't going to go down as the criminal mastermind of the 21st century.

Christopher Gibson raided his local shop in Bournemouth but left a trail of cash leading police straight to his door as he ran from the shop keeper.

Gibson was so well known by Kenan Yildrim that he had even been given credit by them in the past.

So when his face mask slipped during a struggle with shop staff, they recognised him immediately.

The father-of-three went to Premier Boscombe Superstores on January 20 and pointed a knife at Mr Yildrim's throat, demanding cash.

Mr Yildrim pushed Gibson off the counter but he yanked the cash drawer from the till and ran from the shop to his house about 300 yards away around the corner with the store worker in pursuit.

When police turned up at his door, led by the trail of cash, Gibson admitted 'Yeah, I did it'.

Bournemouth Crown Court heard that the failed businessman's marriage had broken down and he was stealing to fund his £400-a-day cocaine habit.

Prosecutor Simon Jones said Gibson was a regular at the shop and he stole between £500 and £600.

He said: 'Kneeling [on the counter], he pointed the knife at Mr Yildirim’s throat and repeatedly said 'give me the till'.

'Mr Yildirim tried to push him away, 
knocking him off balance. As he fell to the floor the cash drawer came 
away and Mr Gibson ran out with it.

Gibson threatened staff at Premier Boscombe Superstores in Bournemouth last month

'Mr Yildirim pursued him to his home and police arrested him there and then after he said "yeah I did it".'

Nigel Mitchell, defending, described the raid as 'very amateurish', and said: 'It was his local convenience store.

'They had even given him credit in the past and his mask came off as he left the shop.

'As he ran down the street the money was dropping on to the pavement, creating a path leading to his door.'

The court heard that Gibson had turned to cocaine after his marriage had broken down.

Mr Mitchell said: 'He has made a real hash of his life over recent years and that has caused him considerable shame.'

Gibson admitted robbery and possessing an offensive weapon on January 20 this year.

Recorder Stephen Climie jailed Gibson for two-and-a-half years for robbery and two months for shoplifting.

He told him: 'Your record reflects your life. I’m satisfied this was an offence committed with a view to obtaining drugs for money.'
