Will absence have made the heart grow stronger? That is the question facing SPRINTER SACRE (Ascot, 3.00) on Saturday.

Sidelined for 386 days by an irregular heartbeat after being pulled up at Kempton, the highest-rated chaser in training puts his reputation on the line in the Clarence House Chase with punters querying if the heart for battle continues to beat strongly in Nicky Henderson’s gelding.

Thorough tests have been completed by Celia Marr, an expert on equine cardiology, and a recent trip to Newbury for a workout suggested the vim and vigour so apparent in Sprinter Sacre’s pre-Kempton outings remain.

However, that was only a racecourse spin and tackling Tingle Creek Chase winner Dodging Bullets, solid benchmark Somersby and recent Leopardstown scorer Twinlight presents a much sterner examination.

The vibes leading into today’s contest have been extraordinary, with Sprinter Sacre’s price bouncing out to around 2-1 from odds-on before the punting public stepped in to support one of their favourite sons.

Hopefully, that faith will prove well placed as plenty have invested heavily in returning the nine-year-old to the track and connections would surely not be risking one of the highest-profile horses to grace jump racing if there were any doubts.

Comparisons have been drawn with Denman, who returned from a similar ailment to win the 2009 Hennessy Gold Cup, although he had been well beaten on his comeback at Kempton the month before.

Sprinter Sacre is a different entity, a sharper model, racier in design, not a bulldozer like the formidable Denman, for whom Kempton was always going to be too tight a track and the wrong way round. Henderson’s management skills are under scrutiny but Sprinter Sacre has passed every test to date.

Earlier, LAND OF VIC (Ascot, nb, 1.50) makes a step up in class in the OLBG.com Mares’ Hurdle but Peter Bowen’s horse has a decent record when the accent is on stamina and could surprise more high-profile rivals.

The nap vote goes to point-to-point winner WHAT'S LEFT (Taunton, nap, 3.55), who makes his handicap debut following a couple of encouraging efforts in novice contests.
