This is the bizarre moment a woman dressed in black wrestled with a taxi driver which was parked across a busy road.

In the video - which appeared on YouTube - the woman can clearly be heard shouting and gesturing at the driver of the black cab. 

About 25 seconds in, she can be seen leaning in to the car and grapples with the man, setting off the car's horn twice.

The woman, dressed in black, approaches the taxi on South Road in Dundee that was parked across the road

As the woman tries to force her way in to the taxi, the driver reacts and shrugs her away 

The woman refuses to back down and the struggle continues, forcing cars to swerve out of the way of the cab

The woman then tries to jump on top of the driver and sets off the car's horn twice 

The driver fends off the woman again and she eventually walked off after the struggle which lasted a minute

In the extraordinary footage, the pair awkwardly struggle in the car seat for almost a minute before the woman walks away.

In the background there is traffic chaos as cars are forced to drive round the vehicle, which is pulled over across one side of the road facing oncoming traffic.

The incident took place on Dundee's South Road and was reported to police. 

A police spokesman said officers were making inquiries into the incident.

Dougie Inglis, owner of Discovery Taxis said: 'The driver in the video works for us. Apparently this happened around ten weeks ago.

'The police have all the details. It should have already been dealt with. There are two dedicated police officers dealing with it.'

Graeme Stephen, chairman of the Dundee Taxi Association, said: 'I don't know what happened in this case, but in general safety is a concern for taxi drivers.

'You're picking up lots of people — sometimes groups of them — and you're on your own.

'You don't know if they've taken alcohol or drugs, or whether they've just argued with their partner.

'A whole host of things could have upset them and the taxi driver gets the brunt of it.

'I find that it's helpful to have CCTV in the taxi.

'Lots of taxis in Dundee have it, I've had it for six and a half years and it's very good.

'The system is set up by the council and the police and they are the only ones who can play back the footage.'
