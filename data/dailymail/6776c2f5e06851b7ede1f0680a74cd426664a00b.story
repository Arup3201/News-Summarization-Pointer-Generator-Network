Chart hits are increasingly glamorising alcohol and could be driving children to drink, researchers have warned.

Almost one in five songs in modern top tens contains a reference to booze – twice as many as ten years ago and almost three times as many as 30 years ago.

The study also found that today’s music is more likely to glorify drinking than songs of the previous decade. Recent number ones referring to  alcohol include Rihanna’s Cheers and Kesha’s Tik Tok.

Since 2001, lyrics about alcohol have more than doubled, according to Liverpool's John Hopkins University. Researchers fear it glamourises drinking to children. One in five songs in the UK charts was found to make references to alcohol, while children and teens were found to spend two hours a day listening to these songs

With former studies showing that exposure to alcohol marketing raises the odds that under-16s will start to drink, the researchers described their findings as a ‘major concern’.

The research team at Liverpool John Moores University counted mentions of alcohol in songs that reached the UK top ten in 1981, 1991, 2001 and 2011. Songs that specifically mentioned drunkenness were also noted.

The proportion of hits featuring alcohol rose from 5.8 per cent in 1981 to 18.5 per cent in 2011. And by 2011, one in eight songs referred to heavy drinking.

The number of references was lowest in 1991, at 2.1 per cent. The researchers say this could be due to the rise of rave culture – linked more to the drug Ecstasy than alcohol.

A selection of lyrics from popular songs that glorify drinking

The study attributes the rise of alcohol-related lyrics to an increase in the amount of U.S songs becoming popular in the UK. It uses Katy Perry's Last Friday Night, a still from the music video pictured, as an example and claims the song links drinking to confidence and success

The analysis, published in the Journal of Music Psychology, found mentions of drink to be most common in tracks  from the US and in R&B, rap and hip-hop genres.

By 2011, the proportion of songs that glamorised alcohol by linking it to confidence, sociability or good looks clearly outweighed those that blamed it for hangovers and health problems.

Similar studies have been done in the US but this is the first to look at British charts.

Researcher Professor Karen Hughes said that the hidden advertising could encourage youngsters to start drinking or lead those who already drink to consume more. She said parents should be aware of the content of songs their children listen to.

The study looked into chart history. Songs in 1981 contained relatively few references to alcohol, with the number declining further in 1991. Yet by 2001 they featured in 8% of hits. This figure continued to climb, more than doubling by 2011 18.5 per cent of the top 10 songs featuring alcohol-related lyrics

Professor Hughes added that although 
lyrics cannot be censored, it may be possible to warn about references 
to alcohol on labels that point out sexually explicit and violent 
lyrics.

The research concluded: ‘Health and other professionals 
should recognise increased alcohol promotion in popular music and ensure
 this does not reinforce the binge drinking culture or contribute to the
 already high burdens of alcohol on young people.’

Earlier this week
 it emerged that 6,580 youngsters aged 18 or under were admitted to 
hospital with alcohol-related problems – some younger than 11.

Emily
 Robinson, of Alcohol Concern, said young people ‘over-estimate how much
 their peers drink’ because advertising for it is ‘simply everywhere’.
