Pep Guardiola has long been touted as Manuel Pellegrini's eventual successor at Manchester City.

And so it may not have come as much of a surprise to see the club's academy chief Patrick Vieira taking in the Spaniard's methods as he took training at Bayern Munich.

The Frenchman, who is performing well in charge of City's youngsters, was snapped by the German champions along with star left back David Alaba.

They tweeted a picture of the pair and revealed that Alaba, who was named in the UEFA team of the year, regarded the ex-Arsenal World Cup winner as his hero.

Sportsmail understands Vieira was in Bavaria to spend time with Guardiola and watch him at work.

Guardiola, 44, made the switch across Europe after a successful stint at Barcelona, where he excelled as a player and a coach.

And it is no secret that City's ex-Barca executive team of Ferran Soriano and Txiki Begiristain are big fans of a man they used to work with.

Pellegrini, 61, has a year-and-a-half left on his contract at the Etihad Stadium.

While his position is not under threat and he may well extend his stay, City will no doubt be making plans for his eventual departure.

The Chilean sang Guardiola's praises ahead of November's Champions League clash in Manchester and even suggested that he should one day manage in England.

'I think it will be very good for him and very good for the Premier League also,' he said.
