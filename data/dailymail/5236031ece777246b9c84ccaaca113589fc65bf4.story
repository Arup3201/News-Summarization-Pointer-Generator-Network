When the trend for cat bearding swept the web recently pet fans thought it really was the cat's whiskers.

The craze involved people holding up furry friends to their faces creating the illusion of a luxurious, hilarious beard.

And now dog owners have jumped on the bandwagon producing similarly brilliant, though admittedly more shaggy and out of control, results.

They've even got their own website where dog and beard aficionados can gather and share pictures of their glorious makeshift beards.

The 
pose involves holding the animal 
vertically nose-to-nose with it looking up for a Father Christmas look.

The cat bearding craze got off to a slow start with the first recorded picture of 
bearding uploaded to tumblr by a user named Catasters in July 2011.

There was a small flurry of interest and the picture spread to a number of other social networking sites.

But it wasn't until 2012 that the fad began to gather momentum following the creation of a dedicated website cat-beard.com.

Bearding follows earlier cat-based memes Breading (taking pictures of 
cats with their heads stuck through slices of bread) and Cats that look
like Hitler.
