A YouTube video shows Marine Matt Bussen singing and performing on a flight for his fellow passengers.

Bussen wrote online 'On the way home from training in Alabama with the U.S. Marines, the stewardesses asked me to serenade the whole plane over the intercom! How could I not sing Home!,' MyFoxChicago pointed out.

At the start of the video - which was uploaded to Facebook four years ago - Bussen walks down the plane's center aisle toward the back.

Using the plane's intercom system, he says 'Hello ladies and gentlemen, my name is Matt Bussen with the United States Marine Corps' - as fellow Marines yell 'Oohrah' enthusiastically.

Important announcement: Bussen uses the plane's intercom system to tell passengers he is about to perform

Job well done! After he is done singing, Bussen shakes hands and bumps fists with the other passengers 

Duty: Bussen is seen here in his fatigues 

'So this song's called "Home" by Michael Buble,' he continues. 

Bussen then proceeds to sing the tune. 

The Marines on-board passengers shake hands and bump fists with Bussen when he is done and returns to his seat. 

In an emailed statement sent to MailOnline late Tuesday evening, Bussen said 'My [Marine] Corps unit was flying home after a two week long training exercise in Alabama. I had been singing for an elderly woman sitting next to me on the plan who was nervous about landing; trying to help calm her nerves. The stewardess had been listening and suggested that the whole plane might like to hear as well.

'Going home had been on my mind all day, so when I got up to sing, that was the song that felt right! I posted this video four years ago and have since been honorably discharged in 2012. While we weren't returning home from an overseas deployment, I am happy that this video is generating so much support for the military and humanizing what it means to be away and come home.'

Bussen wrote on Facebook that he was a reserve Marine for six years 

Bussen wrote on his Facebook page, Matt Bussen Vocals, 'I have had the unique experiences of singing on two different airplanes, and singing the Canadian and U.S. national anthems for two minor league hockey games.

'I have been given the privilege of singing at over a dozen weddings over the last few years, and I have even had the deep honour of singing at several funerals.'

The former soldier also wrote that he 'served in the U.S. Marine Corps reserves from 2006-2012. God has richly blessed me with a beautiful wife and son. I currently sing on my church's worship team, and sing anywhere that I am given the opportunity to.'
