Bodega Bay Fire Department rescuers spotted him on the beach at the bottom of the cliff.

Two firefighter-paramedics rappelled down with a rescue basket and reached the boy, with help from illumination flares fired into the air from a Coast Guard motor lifeboat.

Fire Capt. Justin Fox said: 'He was at the water line and it was low tide. If it was high tide, he wouldn't have been easy to find.' 

Fox says the boy was awake and crying by the time he was loaded into an ambulance and rushed to a hospital.

It's the second rescue in Bodega Bay in three days, after a woman, 23, slipped 20 feet while climbing rocks in Bodega Head.
