David Cameron last night warned Vladimir Putin his billionaire ‘cronies’ will have their assets frozen in London unless he co-operates with the probe into Flight MH17.

The Prime Minister vented his fury at Russia’s obstruction in a 30-minute phone call – the first direct contact between the leaders since the jet was shot down with the loss of 298 lives.

He effectively blamed Russia, telling Mr Putin he had ‘contributed to an appalling tragedy’.

Warned: Vladimir Putin was at the receiving end of a tense 30-minute rant from David Cameron over the phone three days after Flight MH17 crashed as the Prime Minister effectively blamed him for 'an appalling tragedy'

The Prime Minister likened the failure to tackle Vladimir Putin to the appeasement of Hitler in the 1930s, while Foreign Secretary Philip Hammond said Russia risked becoming a 'pariah state' if it carried on arming rebels

Germany's Angela Merkel and French president Francois Hollande said they will hit Russia with fresh sanctions

The Government has openly accused Russia of arming and supporting the Ukrainian rebels who shot down flight MH17.

Foreign Secretary Philip Hammond said: 'The Russians have influence, if not direct control, over these people.

'They have been supplying, they have been supporting them, they cannot deny their responsibility for the acts these people are carrying out.'

'There a growing number of strands of evidence, which looked at together in the round, lead the reasonable person to the unavoidable truth that this was a missile fired from rebel-held territory, almost certainly a missile supplied by the Russians.'

The Prime Minister has said the conflict 'could have been stopped by Moscow'.

He said all the evidence pointed to the fact that 'Flight MH17 was blown out of the sky by a surface-to-air missile fired from a rebel-held area'.

Mr Cameron said: 'If this is the case then we must be clear what it means: this is a direct result of Russia destabilising a sovereign state, violating its territorial integrity, backing thuggish militias and training and arming them.'

And he urged him to ‘change course’ 
by calling off the armed thugs in eastern Ukraine thought to have been 
behind the atrocity that left ten Britons dead.

Britain
 is now pushing for EU sanctions against Mr Putin’s ‘crony group’ of 
wealthy supporters, some of whom use London as their playground.

Downing
 Street refused to comment on exactly which individuals would be 
targeted, but there is speculation it could eventually include 
well-known figures such as Roman Abramovich, who has close links to the 
Putin regime.

No10 
played down suggestions Mr Putin, who is thought to have spirited away 
billions, could be personally targeted at this stage.

Sanctions
 could also include an EU-wide ban on arms sales to Russia and curbs on 
the ability of Russian energy firms to raise money in Europe.

Mr
 Cameron, who will make a statement to the Commons on the crisis today, 
told Mr Putin that Russia’s stance so far was ‘completely unacceptable’.

He urged him to 
intervene immediately to ensure the victims, whose bodies have been 
removed by local militias, could have proper funerals.

A
 source said he told the Russian President: ‘Ten of my citizens have 
just been killed in a plane brought down by a missile fired by Russian 
separatists.

'I have 
been asking to speak to you since this happened. You clearly can play a 
role in exerting influence on the separatists to grant us access to the 
site.’

Earlier, Mr Cameron said the West must ‘fundamentally change our approach to Russia’ in the wake of the crisis.

Britain
 and Australia will today try to push through a UN Security Council 
resolution calling for investigators to be granted immediate access.

But British sources are gloomy about its prospects after Moscow vetoed a similar call on Saturday.

Foreign Secretary Philip Hammond will travel to Brussels tomorrow to hammer out the details of new sanctions on Russia.

Armed separatists in the area around Donetsk in eastern Ukraine have refused investigators access to the site

Recovery: Ukrainian State Emergency Service employees continue to search for bodies amongst the wreckage at the crash site of Malaysia Airlines Flight MH17, near the village of Grabove, 100km east of Donetsk

Mr
 Cameron yesterday held talks with German Chancellor Angela Merkel and 
French President Francois Hollande, both of whom were resisting tough 
sanctions on Russia less than 24 hours before the Malaysia Airlines jet 
was shot down on Thursday. 

A
 No10 spokesman said the two leaders agreed with Mr Cameron that ‘the EU
 must reconsider its approach to Russia and that foreign ministers 
should be ready to impose further sanctions’.

However,
 No10 cautioned that the crisis was running faster than the Brussels 
machinery can cope with – meaning that it may take some weeks before the
 new sanctions regime is fully in place.

Sources stressed Mr Putin has the chance to limit the damage to Russia’s struggling economy by co-operating fully now.

A
 small number of senior Russian officials have been subjected to asset 
freezes and travel bans following Russia’s annexation of the Crimea 
earlier this year.

Mr Hammond yesterday said these would now be widened to ‘include the so-called crony group around President Putin’.

Mr Cameron has led calls for tougher sanctions on Russia but has faced resistance from Germany's Angela Merkel. The Netherlands' Mark Rutte (right) is likely to back sanctions following last week's attack

Downing
 Street said it would press for action against ‘individuals who have 
influence on the Russian leadership and who have influence in terms of 
financial flows’. 

Mr 
Hammond acknowledged that the level of sanctions being considered could 
hurt London, where wealthy Russians have invested an estimated 
£27billion, and said other countries must ‘share the pain’.

He said: ‘We have levers which we can apply to Russia; we can inflict damage on the Russian economy.’

In a strongly-worded article in the Sunday Times, Mr Cameron said the West could not allow Russia’s actions in Ukraine to stand.

‘This is not about military action, plainly,’ he said.

‘But
 it is time to make our power, influence and resources count. Our 
economies are strong, and growing in strength. And yet we sometimes 
behave as if we need Russia more than Russia needs us.’  

Following
 Moscow’s annexation of Crimea, Alexei Navalny, a leading critic of Mr 
Putin, said sanctions should target figures such as Mr Abramovich and 
businessman Alisher Usmanov, who owns a major stake in Arsenal football 
club.

Mr Abramovich 
made no comment at the time but is understood to consider himself a 
private citizen who should not face sanctions.

He
 is a close ally of Mr Putin and is said to enjoy ‘privileged access’ to
 the Russian President, but has always denied playing any political 
role.
