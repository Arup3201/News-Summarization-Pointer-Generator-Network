The varied wild habitats that make up Britain are the heart and - as these images show - the brains of our green and pleasant land.

In the aerial photos of saltmarshes at Abbotts Hall Farm, near Colchester, Essex, water channels slice through the boggy ground.

And as they cut out pathways and patterns, they resemble the delicate and unique surface of the human brain.

At Abbotts Hall Farm, 60 hectares of mudflats have been created by building a new sea wall further inland.

These help absorb the impact of the waves, as well as providing a habitat for hundreds of birds and sea creatures.

Other endangered coastlines in Britain include:

The coastal marshes of Essex are disappearing rapidly, with up to 60 per cent having been eroded by the sea in the last 20 years.

One aim of the Essex Wildlife Trust's farm was to recreate some of these lost saltmarsh habitats, which are vital for the future of both wildlife and people.

In particular, the marshes are of international importance for migrating birds, which come in their thousands to the Essex Coast.

The site is also home to a large number of herring, young bass, and 14 other types of fish feeding in the creeks within the marshes.

Over the course of 20 months, this initiative saw 20 photographers documenting 20 of Britain's crucial ecosystems.

The aim was to show the value of restoring our most important but often fragmented natural habitats.

And if there is one cause that doesn't need much brainpower to think about, it's protecting our amazing natural landscape and wildlife.
