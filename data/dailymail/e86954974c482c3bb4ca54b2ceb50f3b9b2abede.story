David Cameron has piled pressure on Pakistan to catch the killers of a British family who were gunned down in cold blood following the breakdown of an arranged marriage.

Tania Yousaf, 22, and her parents Mohammed, 51, and Parviaz, 49, from Nelson, Lancashire, died in a hail of bullets from three armed gunmen in Gujrat in 2010.

They had been in Pakistan for the wedding of one son but died because
 of a bitter dispute over the pending divorce of another, police say.

However, nobody has ever been brought to justice since two of the suspected killers were arrested - with their mother - but went on the run when they were granted bail.

Gunned down: Mohammed Yousaf and his daughterTania, who were killed in Gujrat in 2010

As the trio were ambushed by the machine gun-wielding gang, mother-of-two Tania was shot in the legs, but managed to run for cover.

The shooters tracked her down after killing Mr and Mrs Yousaf and then pulled out a mobile phone and ordered her to speak to her husband before blasting her up to 100 times.

Killed: Mother Parviaz, 49, was also murdered in the attack believed to have been retribution for the breakdown of the 10-year arranged marriage of their son Kamar

Police believe the slayings were retribution for the breakdown of a 10-year 
arranged marriage between one of Mr and Mrs Yousaf's three sons, Kamar,
 and his cousin Nabeela.

Days later, Nabeela's mother, Rahmat Bibi, and two brothers, Shiraz and Naveed Arif, were arrested in connection with the crime.

But the brothers, believed to have been among the gunmen, fled as soon as they were granted bail. They have not been 
seen since.

The mystery deepened in April this year when Tania’s grandmother, Fukraz Begum, was beaten to death in Gujrat in what police believe was a connected attack.

Now the Prime Minister has demanded answers from the Pakistani government after two years without any further developments.

Writing to Andrew Stephenson, the family's local MP, Mr Cameron said: 'I cannot begin to imagine how difficult this must be for the families of those involved.

'I fully appreciate that the families will want to see
the people responsible for these crimes brought to justice. 

'This is the least
that they deserve and I can understand their frustrations with the slow pace of
the investigations.'

He said he dispatched delegates from the Foreign and Commonwealth Office to step up pressure on the Pakistani authorities over the summer and promised to meet Mr Stephenson when Parliament reassembles in Autumn to update him on progress.

'As you are aware the Foreign and 
Commonwealth Office Ministers have taken an active interest in both 
cases, and in the wider issue of the safety of British nationals in 
Pakistan,' he added.

Aftermath: Pakistani relatives and residents carry a cot with the body of Mohamamd Yousaf near the town of Gujrat in eastern Pakistan

The murders took place in the Gujrat district of north east Pakistan where the Yousaf family had travelled for a wedding of another one of their sons, Asad, then 23, to his fiance, Roma.

Furniture manufacturer Mr Yousaf and his wife and daughter, a former Pendle Council worker, had stayed in Pakistan after the wedding to visit friends and relatives while the rest of the family returned to the UK.

They were in the village of Murirya, paying respects at a relative's grave site when the raiders struck.

Tough talk: The Prime Minister has demanded answers from the Pakistani government after two years without any further developments in the hunt to catch the killers

Abdul Hussain, a cousin and family spokesman, said after attack: '[Shooting Tania in the legs] could have been on purpose or they could have just been spraying bullets and got her in the legs.

'She hid, so they dealt with the parents and then went after her. They knew she was somewhere in the graveyard.

'The conversation between Tania and her husband was very minimal. He heard her beg for her life and then heard gunfire.'

Her brother Asad, 25, added: 'She begged for her children and said she needed her two little boys [...] and then they just shot her.'

Relatives have claimed Mr Yousaf was warned 
never to set foot in the village, which is home to the family of his son
 Kamar’s estranged wife Nabeela.

When Kamar and Nabeela, who lived in 
Nelson and have two children, split up in 2009, it triggered the feud 
which led to her brothers warning Mr Yousaf he faced 'grave 
consequences' if he ever returned to their home village.

But Mr Yousaf defied the warning 
after returning to Pakistan with his wife and daughter for the wedding 
of another of his sons in a village 15 miles away.

Responding to the Prime Minister's call to action, Mr Stephenson said: 'The government cannot go higher than the Prime Minister personally intervening.

'Hopefully this will bring justice for the Yousafs and Fukraz Begum’s family closer and also ensure that other British citizens who suffer tragic losses in Pakistan do not have to go through the same prolonged ordeal.'

Escaped: One of the two suspects captured in the killing stares out from behind bars in a Pakistani jail before being granted bail

Senseless: Covered with a blanket, the body of one of the victims is carried away

Pendle councillor Eileen Ansar, a relative of the Yousafs and friend of Fukraz Begum’s family, said: 'I think it is great that the Prime Minister has personally intervened in these cases and that they have gone to the very top of government.

'Hopefully this bring justice a step closer for the families and will ensure that British citizens who a victims of crime in Pakistan get simpler and speedier justice in the future.'
