A startling video has shown three teenagers beating a passerby as hundreds of others looked on and recorded the fight.

Jordan Gonzalez, 18, Mac Piazza, 18, and a 16-year-old boy have been arrested following the disturbing incident that unfolded in Hinkley Park in Park Ridge, Illinois at 10pm on Thursday July 12.

Footage obtained by the Park Ridge Herald-Advocate shows a 48-year-old man being pushed 
to the ground, punched and kicked by the teenagers as hundreds of others swarm them.

The man had been looking for his son when someone threw a lit firework near his feet, and when he asked who had thrown it, a large group of teenagers moved around him, police said.

Violent: A video shows a 48-year-old man being pushed to the ground and kicked by youngsters as he walked through a park. The fight began after someone threw a firework near him and he asked who threw it

Altercation: Even when the man gets back on his feet, the teenagers circle around him, yelling

After verbally assaulting the man, a few of the teenagers started to attack him, police said.

The man suffered a concussion, cuts and bruises.

In the video, after the man is beaten, he gets back to his feet and tries to leave the area. At one point, teenagers lunge at him again, but another teen blocks the way to stop the attack.

Police said there may have been as many as 200 teenagers in the park, which was hosting 'Taste of Park Ridge', a weekend of food and entertainment in the park.

The three teenagers were charged with felony aggravated battery and mob action for the attack.

Gonzalez
 and Piazza appeared in court Wednesday and their bond was set at 
$40,000 and $30,000, respectively. They both remained at Cook County 
Jail.

If they do post bond, they must wear an electronic monitoring device, police said.

The 16-year-old will appear in juvenile court.

Police
 now hope to find and thank the teenager who was seen trying to stop one
 of the suspects from attacking the man a second time.
