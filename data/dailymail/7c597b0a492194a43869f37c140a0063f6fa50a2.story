Seven hairstylists have reached a confidential settlement with a former co-worker to end a lawsuit over a $9.5 million lottery jackpot, parties in the case said on Thursday.

Defendant Christy Shaw, who claimed she bought the winning ticket separately from those purchased with pooled money, told WTHR-TV that everyone walked away with something. She said everyone decided it was in their best interest to settle.

'We were tired and ready to get it over with,' Ms Shaw said.

Pay-out: Hair stylists from an Indianapolis salon reached a settlement today over a $9.5million lottery ticket that one worker tried to claim for herself

The seven plaintiffs claimed everyone 
in the group agreed to share any winnings from tickets purchased at the 
same time as those for the pool.

A
court document stated Shaw knew the rules because they were regularly 
discussed in the salon, Lou's Creative Styles in the Indianapolis 
enclave of Lawrence.

However,
Shaw, who no longer works at the salon, said in court filings that no 
one there ever told her that the person buying tickets for the group 
could not purchase personal tickets at the same location.

'I didn't know about that rule. They're saying everyone knew about it. I did not,' Shaw said.

An
Indianapolis judge issued a preliminary injunction in March barring the
Hoosier Lottery from paying the jackpot from a February 16 drawing 
until the case was resolved

The
settlement was confidential, but co-plaintiff Margie Day-Brugh hinted 
that all will receive sizeable shares of the jackpot when she told the 
Indianapolis Star that she doesn't expect her co-workers to quit.

'We
probably could, but we enjoy our jobs,' she said. 'We are all happy 
with the outcome and just wish it could have been settled in a nice 
way.'

The parties agreed to settle on Tuesday evening after a mediation hearing on Monday.

Lottery
spokeswoman Stephanie McFarland said the parties can claim the prize at
Hoosier Lottery headquarters in Indianapolis once the preliminary 
injunction is lifted.

'We are awaiting notification from the court,' McFarland said.
