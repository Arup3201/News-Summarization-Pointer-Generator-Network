An 80-year-old patient died in hospital days after he was given a drug to which he was allergic.

John Dudding, of Plymouth, Devon, suffered a severe reaction after being given a penicillin-based injection at Derriford Hospital in the city - and died one week before his daughter’s wedding

Now she is suing the hospital for clinical negligence, claiming the penicillin allergy was clearly labelled on her father's medical chart - but could not be seen because there was a Post-it note in the way.

Kim Tremaine, 54, said her father was also wearing a red wrist band to warn he had allergies - but claimed nobody rolled up his pyjama sleeve to check.

Plymouth Hospitals NHS Trust, which runs Derriford Hospital, has admitted the ‘serious drug error’.

Mrs Tremaine said: ‘In my opinion Derriford Hospital killed my father and did very little to save him. My dad didn’t go in there ill enough to die. The care he received was appalling, disgraceful.’

Mr Dudding died in February last year and his daughter said the drugs blunder happened three days after he was admitted having suffered a fall at home. An inquest is set to be held by a local coroner.

A Plymouth Hospitals NHS Trust spokesman said: ‘We let Mr Dudding down in terms of the care we provided because there was a serious drug error and we apologise sincerely for this.

‘We don’t know how, or if this drug error contributed to Mr Dudding’s death. That is for the inquest to determine.’

The 1,100-bed hospital in March reported five 'never events' since November which all related to treatment or surgery to the wrong part of the body. 'Never events' are defined as serious and mostly-preventable incidents which should not occur.

Almost 50,000 people pass through the hospital's entrance weekly - and it has more than 900 beds.
