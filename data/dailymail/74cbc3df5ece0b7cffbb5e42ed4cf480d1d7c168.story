Barbie is no longer the most popular girl in the toy store. 

For the past 11 years, the Mattel doll has been top of the Christmas gift list for parents of girls. 

But she has been knocked into the No.2 spot by the Disney film Frozen.

Around one in five parents are planning to buy an item of merchandise from the animated film for their daughters, according to the annual Holiday Top Toys survey from America's National Retail Federation. 

While 20 per cent of parents are relying on the children's film to bring a smile to their girl's face on Christmas morning, 16 per cent of mothers and fathers are still planning on purchasing a Barbie - it is the first time in the survey's history that the brand has been beaten. 

The Frozen film has taken the world by storm since its release in November last year. 

By June, it had already made $1.2 billion (£765,198,768) worldwide at the box office, making it the fifth highest-grossing film of all time. 

The movie's catchy soundtrack has sold more than a million copies and been streamed more than eight million times on Spotify, it has also spawned numerous copycat videos on YouTube of children singing with their parents.

The success didn't just translate to sales figures though - UK parenting website Babycentre reported earlier this year that the name Elsa had gone from No.331 in the list of girls' baby names to No.88. 

While Frozen has proved a hit with children around the world, the plot-line was also attractive to the parents. 

Much has been made of Elsa and Anna being good role models for young girls, with their strong personalities and their close bond of sisterhood.  

And now, the popularity of the film means it is expected to dominate the toy market too. 

While the success of Elsa and her frozen friends has been undoubtedly created by the movie, Barbie has also had a difficult year in terms of press. 

The doll's makers have tried hard to bring the doll into the 21st century, with versions of the toy including Business Barbie and a 'Share A Smile Becky' doll that featured Barbie in a wheelchair.

But Mattel has still been marred by criticism that Barbie's figure is completely out of proportion to a normal woman, therefore creating unrealistic standards for young girls. 

They also attracted negative publicity earlier this month for a book called 'Barbie: I Can Be A Computer Engineer,' which actually showed Barbie needing the help of her male friends to do the job. 

The response to the book was so negative that Mattel was forced to removed the product from shelves and promise that it would only write story-lines in the future that would inspire girls. 

With its distinctive pink packaging, Barbie will also have been hit by the recent argument for toy stores to move away from gender stereotypes for children.

While there has been a shake-up of sorts in the girls Christmas present sector this year, little has changed in the boys market. 

Lego have maintained the top spot for parents buying gifts for their sons, with the general 'cars and trucks', taking the second place. 

NRF President and CEO Matthew Shay said: 'Parents will not have to go far to find good deals on the toys their children have put at the top of their lists. 

'Retailers have spent weeks preparing for the holiday rush to make sure that the season’s hottest toys are both easy to find in stores and online, and competitively priced.'
