We are officially a nation of potty mouths, with the average Britain using up to 14 swear words a day, according to new research.

From Kim Sears furious four letter tirade at the Australian open to Stephen Fry's risqué and foul-mouthed comments at the Baftas, obscenities have become more commonplace than ever.

Rather than watching our language Britons are turning the air blue with expletives making up at least one in every 1,700 words used in both spoken and written British English.

Our favourite curse is bloody followed by f***ing, f***, bugger and bastard, according to the Times.

But people are not swearing like sailors in spoken words, authors are also getting in on the act.

According to the study one in every 170,000 words published is f*** and the average person uses between four and 14 swearwords a day.

The research comes after Andy Murray's fiancée Kim Sears hit the headlines after the usually poised 27-year-old appeared to hurl a string of expletives towards Czech player Tomas Berdych

As tensions boiled over, the devoted supporter was caught on camera appearing to mouth 'F*****g have that, you Czech flash f***', or 'Take that, you flash f**k’. 

Actress Sheridan Smith famously mouthed ‘f*****g hell’ when accepting her Bafta for Leading Actress at the 2013 ceremony for her title role in Mrs Biggs, followed by: ‘Is this a wind up? Is this for a real? You shouldn’t cry, you look like a k**b. Oh f***, sorry.’

And just this week Kanye West delivered an expletive filled performance as he debuted his new single, All Day, at the 2015 BRIT Awards.

The controversial rapper was heard using the N-word at least three times. 

But it would appear not everyone is okay with bad language, the BBC received 293 complaints after Stephen Fry hosted the Baftas this year.

At one point the comedian told the audience it was 'p***ing down with stars' inside, while later he introduced Tom Cruise as 'Tom f***ing Cruise' when the Mission Impossible star came on stage to present an award.

Also last year Russian president Vladimir Putin reportedly signed a new law  which banned swearing in Russian plays, films and books

The new data was produced by Michael McCarthy, emeritus professor of English at the University of Nottingham, after studying a database of transcripts, sound recordings, and books.

'The biggest change of all, in recent decades, has of course been the frequency of the taboo words in film and broadcast media,' he said, according to the Times.

'Almost anything goes: the C-word occurred in a recent episode of Wolf Hall.'
