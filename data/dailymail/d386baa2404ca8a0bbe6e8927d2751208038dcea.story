Dangerous: Shaun Tudor has been jailed indefinitely for the attempted rape and sexual assault of a ten-year-old boy in Rainworth, Nottinghamshire

A convicted sex offender attacked a ten-year-old boy just minutes after being allowed to walk out of his secure unit unsupervised.

Shaun Tudor, who has spent 23 years in psychiatric institutions, was granted unescorted leave even though he had a history of attacking boys – and once did so while on leave from another unit.

In his latest attack, Tudor dragged his terrified victim into some bushes within ten minutes of being let out.

The 43-year-old, who completed two spells totalling seven years at high-security mental institution Rampton, then sexually assaulted and attempted to rape the boy.

Yesterday, at Nottingham Crown Court, Tudor was jailed indefinitely over the attack, in Rainworth, Nottinghamshire.

The court heard that it had left the family of Tudor’s victim, who cannot be named for legal reasons, in ‘turmoil’, and forced them to leave the area.

After sentencing, the family’s solicitor, Martin Lee, said: ‘They feel terribly let down by the system that allowed Tudor to be placed at this unit in a residential area. And they have other questions. Why was Tudor, with his record, allowed out of the unit unaccompanied?’

Tudor struck on a ‘sunny afternoon’ last July, the court heard.

Tudor told the two 
boys he was 'looking at nature' then pretended to fall over. When the victim
 went to help him up, he grabbed him and carried him off into bushes and
 carried out sex attack

His victim was playing with a friend in woods 250 yards from his home.

After being released from the nearby 
St Andrew’s Healthcare Centre on a two-hour leave of absence, Tudor 
spotted the boys and told them he was ‘looking at nature’. He then 
pretended to fall over, and when his victim went to help him up, Tudor 
grabbed him and carried him into bushes, out of the sight of his friend.

There, Tudor attacked the boy, before threatening to ‘track him down and kill him’ if he reported what had happened.

The boy returned to his friend and initially didn’t say anything.

But when he got home, he began sobbing and told his horrified mother, who called the police.

Tudor was picked up eight hours 
later, around five miles away. After his arrest, he told officers: ‘I’ve
 been doing so well for the last 24 years.’

Tudor had indecently assaulted young 
boys on two previous occasions – in 1984, when he was just 16, and then 
again four years later.  

Tudor was convicted of indecent 
assault over the second attack, on a seven-year-old boy, which happened 
while he was on weekend leave from a psychiatric hospital in Birmingham.

Tudor first came to the attention of the authorities in 1984 at the age of 16 when he was given a care order for indecently assaulting a six-year-old boy, Nottingham Crown Court heard.

Four years later, he launched a horrific attack on a seven-year-old boy while on weekend leave while being treated at a psychiatric hospital in Birmingham.

The court heard he approached the youngster, who was on a bike, and marched him down to a river where he ordered him to remove his trousers.

But when the frightened boy soiled himself, Tudor became angry and held his head under water while striking him with a rock.

He was convicted of indecent assault and given his first hospital order.

Since then, Tudor has never been free, spending his entire adult life in different psychiatric hospitals across the UK.

He was in Rampton from 1988 to 1995, returning for a second spell in 1998. 

Tudor was moved to St Andrew's in Nottinghamshire from a low security unit in Northamptonshire when it was reclassified as a 'locked unit'.

Steven Taylor, mitigating, said his 'grading risk had gone up and down under different regimes' over the years.

He added: 'His preference clearly is for young boys and he was unable to control himself on this latest occasion.

'He probably convinced himself that he would be able to manage in the community.'

He was sent to Rampton, the high 
security mental institution which has treated ‘Angel of Death’ nurse 
Beverley Allitt, Soham murderer Ian Huntley and serial killer Mark 
Rowntree. He was there until 1995, returning for a spell in 1998.

The court heard Tudor had been moved 
to the medium-to-low security St Andrew’s Centre eight months before his
 latest attack. It was also told that in a pre-sentence report, Tudor 
said: ‘I will definitely reoffend against children if I am released into
 the community.’

Steven Taylor, defending, said that 
Tudor ‘plainly was not safe to be out on unescorted leave’, and that 
‘someone at St Andrew’s had taken a chance’.

But Judge John Burgess said he 
believed there was an ‘element of deviousness’ about how Tudor answered 
questions which allowed him to be granted leave, and that he ‘appeared 
to have learned what to say to impress’.

Judge Burgess said he was imposing a 
jail term, instead of the hospital orders Tudor had been subject to in 
the past, because ‘everything had been tried and not worked’.

He handed Tudor, who admitted 
attempted rape and sexual assault, an indeterminate sentence for public 
protection with a recommendation he serve at least four years and ten 
months before being considered for release.

In reality, the judge said, it was unlikely he would ever be freed.

A spokesman for St Andrew’s 
Healthcare, a not-for-profit mental health charity, said: ‘St Andrew’s 
wants to reassure the community of its commitment to good practice and 
that an incident of this type is exceptionally rare.’

He said the decision to allow Tudor 
unescorted leave was ‘clinically appropriate, based on the information 
available at the time’.

Detective Inspector Caroline Racher, 
of Nottinghamshire Police, said: ‘We...have been working with the 
management at St Andrew’s to ensure there can be no repetition of such a
 terrible incident.’
