Britain's youngest competitive bodybuilder has revealed that the secret to his muscular body is down to sibling rivalry. 

Cosmo Taylor, 15, from Inverness, Scotland, has competed in a major national competition and is more likely to be honing his abs in his local gym than gaming on his Playstation.

But Cosmo's unusual passion for the sport is something that runs in the family with his sister and father providing healthy competition for the young athlete.

Cosmo Taylor (right) is Britain's youngest competitive body builder and he says the secret to his honed body is stiff competition with his sister Bronwyn who is a prize-winning powerlifter 

Bronwyn, 19, is a prize-winning powerlifter and Andrew, 47, is a bodybuilder.

And while the brother and sister duo continually push each other to improve their personal bests, Cosmo admits that there is some bubbling sibling rivalry between the pair.

'I'm very competitive with Bronwyn.' says the 15-year-old. 'If she's going to do 12 reps on something, I'll do 15. It's a sibling thing.'

At just 14 Cosmo took part in his first national competition in Aberdeen in November 2014

As well as his sister providing plenty of stiff competition, Cosmo's father Andrew, left, is also a body builder 

Andrew says that when the siblings visit the gym together they will often challenge one another 

Their father says that although Bronwyn is lighter than Cosmo she is probably stronger and provides a fair amount of competition for her younger brother 

Cosmo also admits that although his family offers him plenty of support their competitive streak can also become a nuisance.  

'My dad and sister were a big inspiration, but sometimes my sister can be a big irritation.'

And the rivalry has not escaped the attention of dad Andrew who says that he often sees the siblings go head to head while working out.

'Sometimes in the gym there can be a competitive edge to them, depending on who's working what particular exercise that night, and if they both happen to be working the same exercise, they will feed off each other.'

He added that although Cosmo is heavier than his sister that does not stop her from providing some stiff competition for her younger brother. 

'Bronwyn being that bit older, although she's a girl and lighter than Cosmo, she will often just reel Cosmo in,' he said.

As a competitive family, their living room is littered with trophies from the family's achievements 

'She'll let him go so far, but then she pulls it right back because she's got a lot more experience than Cosmo.

'Pound for pound she's probably just as strong and in a lot of events she's still actually stronger than Cosmo, something that Cosmo finds difficult to accept at times. But that's just the way it is because Bronwyn does tend to catch everyone out with the way she looks.'

Breakfast: Scrambled eggs and porridge oats

Mid-morning: Roast chicken and salad

Lunch: Chicken, pork, steak or fish with vegetables and brown rice

Dinner: Chicken, pork, steak or fish with salad and sweet potato

Andrew added that you shouldn't be fooled by Bronwyn's feminine looks. 

'She's very slim, slender, tall, elegant, but you put weights on the ground and she will outlift most people, even Cosmo, and that's something he's got to live with for a little while.'

Bronwyn, who competes at national and international powerlifting events, works for the family's removals business - and Cosmo is more than happy to lend a hand when he can.

She says: 'Doing removals keeps me mobile but I wouldn't class it as training, it's a different type of strength but it allows me plenty of free hours to pursue my interests that I wouldn't have with a nine to five job.'

Cosmo, who started training informally at the age of 11, competed in his first show, the Silver City Classic Bodybuilding in Aberdeen, in November 2014, and has plans to enter more competitions in the future.

Cosmo says that he is enjoying all the attention his muscles receive at school

The siblings combines muscles come in handy for lending a hand in the family's removal business 

But for now Cosmo says that he is enjoying the attention that his super-sized muscles bring him at school.

'Some people want to see my abs, see my arms, they think it's really cool. Some people even want me to be their personal trainer!

'I think it's quite funny, but they're always supportive, asking me if I've got any events coming up, there's a really good atmosphere.'

And while some people have expressed concerns about Cosmo competing at such a young age, he is adamant that he is not putting himself at risk.

'I've been training for almost four years now and I've been injury free. If you're going to do something stupid, that's how you're going to injure yourself. It's the same with any sport.'
