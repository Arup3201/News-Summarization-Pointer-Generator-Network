Southampton manager Ronald Koeman has admitted he has no immediate plans to hold contract talks with Swansea and Crystal Palace target Jack Cork.

The midfielder scored Southampton's opener in their 2-0 Capital One Cup win over Millwall on Tuesday, but could leave the club for nothing next summer when his contract expires.

Koeman suggested the 25-year-old wanted to stay at the club, which he joined in 2011, but when asked if talks were planned, he said: 'At this moment, no.'

Transfer: Ronald Koeman wants Jack Cork to stay at Southampton despite interest from elsewhere

The Dutchman added: 'He is a player of Southampton, a player for the midfield position. There were a lot of rumours but Jack is doing very good with ambition to stay at Southampton.

'OK, if there is any possibility for him and he is not happy then he knows the door is open to my office, he can come to talk. Then we will see what the best is for everyone in this situation.'

Palace have shown interest in Cork this summer, though it remains to be seen if new manager Neil Warnock shares those plans. Swansea, meanwhile, have followed the midfielder for more than a year and are considering a move.

But the Saints boss hopes to bring in two new players this week.

Deadline: The Dutch manager said he hopes to bring in players in two positions before the transfer deadline

While Southampton's' outgoing players have dominated the headlines this summer, Koeman has already added seven new faces including Fraser Forster, Shane Long, Graziano Pelle and Dusan Tadic.

The Dutchman has been linked with a move for Atletico Madrid's Belgian defender Toby Alderweireld but refused to confirm his interest in the 25-year-old.

However, Koeman is confident of landing two targets ahead of Monday's transfer deadline.

'I don't talk about names of players,' he said.

'In two positions we are trying to bring in new players and we hope to bring (them) in this week.

'The club is doing everything for that and I hope we will finish with that this week.'
