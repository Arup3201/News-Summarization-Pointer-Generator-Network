Mastermind: Daniel David Pawa reportedly hatched the plot to hawk more than 40 gallons of moonshine to undercover agents

A trio of Florida moonshine makers are in hot water for hawking more than 40 gallons of the potent alcoholic beverage to undercover cops - the second such 'shine' bust made in the Sunshine State in the last calendar year, alone.

Daniel David Pawa was ensnared in a sting after a middle-man acting under his auspices reportedly replied in November to a phony Craigslist ad posted by authorities that was simply entitled, 'Moonshine?' 

The red herring was actually put on the website on Nov. 13 by Florida Division of Alcoholic Beverages and Tobacco agents in a bid to root out moonshine makers from the state, according to The Orlando Sentinel.

It only took Pawa's intermediary a half-hour to reply to the post, which humorously requested that whoever had the 'strong stuff' should shoot the agents a text.

'Saw your ad on Craigslist looking for some shine,' the Pawa accomplice reportedly texted agents. 

Also arrested on Friday, according to the Sentinel, were accomplices Michael Ryan Inman, 25, and Amanda Marie Pouncey, 26.

Pawa - for his part - is reportedly charged with operating a still from a house in the 200 block of East Palm Street in Lantana. He was arrested a day before, or Thursday.

'The danger in moonshine comes from the use of unregulated materials, which can lead to various threats to the consumers' health,' Sandi Copes Poreda, a spokeswoman for the Florida Department of Business and Professional Regulation, told The Sentinel.

Pawa reportedly told the undercover agents he was not only a prolific moonshine maker, but a versatile one, as well. The Lantana man offered the agents the choice of a fruity-flavored moonshine, or a variety that boasted a sweet-tea taste.

Pawa reportedly also counted an unflavored, tongue-tingling 180 proof moonshine among his repertoire that would amount to 90 per cent alcohol by volume, or considerably stronger than the most potent spirit allowed under Florida law.

The sting occurred Nov. 17 outside a West Palm Beach IHOP during which Inman and two others met with the undercover agents, who paid $150-a-gallon for the moonshine, The Sentinel wrote.

Florida ABT agents arrested one other person in Florida on moonshine charges in the last 12 months, Poreda reportedly said.

In November, agents in Fort Pierce arrested Jefferson Auvil on misdemeanor moonshine possession and illegal alcohol sale violations, Poreda told the Sentinel, adding that the man was found guilty in December.
