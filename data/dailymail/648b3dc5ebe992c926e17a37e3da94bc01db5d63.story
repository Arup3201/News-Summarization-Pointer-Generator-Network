Andrej Kramaric has been told he must hit the ground running for Leicester in their bid to beat the drop as the Premier League’s bottom side ready themselves for an unrelenting run of fixtures.

Leicester goalkeeper Ben Hamer knows his team need goals instantly with games against Manchester United, Arsenal, Chelsea and Manchester City within the space of a month — and spelt that out to his new team-mate.

Kramaric played 30 minutes in the defeat against Stoke which undermined Leicester’s recent revival, following the Croatian striker’s £9.3million move from Rijeka after a successful work-permit appeal.

The 23-year-old has scored 28 goals in 31 games this season but had not played for a month before Saturday. 

‘It is hard. He’s just come over and he gets thrown into the action,’ said Hamer. 

‘Really, he’s got to make an instant impact. Hopefully he can. He hasn’t got time to settle down because we haven’t got that opportunity. Time is of the essence.

‘He’s been sharp in training. I’ve been impressed with him.’

Hamer, 27, has stepped up to replace Kasper Schmeichel, who is out for a few more weeks after breaking a metatarsal.

Manager Nigel Pearson said there was no guarantee the Danish goalkeeper would come straight back into his team once fit, nor that Mark Schwarzer, signed from Chelsea aged 42, would get a game either.

‘I will make the decision on who plays based on who I think is best at any given time,’ said Pearson. ‘Nobody has a divine right to play and I have been pretty pleased with Ben since he has been in the side.’

Bojan scored a superb goal to win the game, his fourth in 10 appearances to cement his status as one of the best value signings last summer. His modest cost of £500,000 is put into context by the price needed to bring Kramaric to England, or the £25m to take Wilfried Bony to Manchester City.
