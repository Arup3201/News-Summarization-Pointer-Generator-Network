Kit Symons will be announced as Fulham’s new manager this week, barring any last minute change of heart by Shahid Khan.

The Cottagers owner is due to fly back to London on Wednesday night, with his caretaker boss likely to be appointed on Thursday.

Symons has overseen five wins from his eight games in charge, leaving Khan with little choice but to promote the coach.

The 64-year-old was handed a trio of prospective new bosses by the five-man search committee installed to ‘provide guidance’ in their quest to find Felix Magath’s successor.

Danny Murphy, Brian McBride and Niall Quinn were alongside supporter and Nike director David Daly and academy boss Huw Jennings.

Symons took temporary charge at the back end of September with Fulham rooted to the foot of the Championship table.

But his sterling transformation at Craven Cottage has seen his side’s record only beaten by Bournemouth and Derby County in the month following. 

The odds of Hull City’s Steve Bruce taking over from Magath had tumbled on Monday night but there was never anything in the link, while moves for ex-Premier League managers Chris Hughton and Steve Clarke were also mooted.

After Fulham’s 3-0 win against Charlton on Friday night Symons said: 'I'm very confident I'll get it, it has to be getting more difficult, with the team winning games, for the five-man panel not to see the obvious thing to do for this football club.’
