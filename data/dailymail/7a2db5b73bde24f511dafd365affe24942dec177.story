The parents of badly injured F1 driver Jules Bianchi have arrived by his bedside at the Japanese hospital where he is fighting for his life in intensive care.

Philippe and Christine Bianchi arrived at the Mie General Hospital in Yokkaichi last night, a day after their son was badly hurt in a smash during the rain-soaked Japanese Grand Prix.

'When we have an update with Saillant, we will speak to you,' Philippe Bianchi told waiting reporters, referring to French brain injury specialist Professor Gerard Saillant, who has flown to Japan to assist in Bianchi's care.

Prof Saillant, president of the FIA medical commission, arrived in Yokkaichi early this morning and went straight to the hospital where Bianchi is said to be in a 'critical' condition.

On Sunday, the Marussia driver suffered a severe head injury when his car smashed into a tractor rescuing the crashed Sauber of Adrian Sutil, who had spun off on the previous lap of the Japanese Grand Prix.

Prof Saillant arrived at Mie General Hospital with Nicolas Todt, Bianchi's agent, and went straight in via the emergency entrance to avoid crowds of waiting reporters, Le Parisien reports.

Bianchi, who is just 25, remains in intensive care today after emergency surgery on a severe head injury following his high speed crash on the rain-soaked Suzuka circuit.

Sources at the hospital said Bianchi was breathing but only with the help of a ventilator, not on his own as was originally reported in the French media on Sunday night.

Famous in the world of sport and one of France's leading neurologists, Prof Saillant is a brain and spinal injury expert with a particular specialism in motorsports.

It was he who helped to treat Michael Schumacher after the retired F1 ace's devastating head injury while skiiing in December last year. He also oversaw Schumacher's medical care when he broke his leg in the 1999 British Grand Prix.

A spokesman for the FIA, Formula One's governing body, said last night Bianchi's condition was ‘critical but stable’ and it is understood his family will finally see him on Tuesday. They had been delayed in getting to him due to Typhoon Phanfone.

The first video of the horrific moment Bianchi crashed into the digger has now been distributed online. The clip was released as Jules Bianchi was revealed to be in a ‘critical but stable’ condition following the crash. 

An ambulance was sent to the scene straight after Bianchi's crash - which knocked him unconscious - and the 25-year-old Frenchman was taken to the Mie General Medical Center in Yokkaichi.

Last night Camille Marchetti, 24, the French girlfriend of Bianchi, sent up a prayer through Twitter for her 'champion' as he fought for his life in hospital.

Bianchi's father, Philippe, told French TV that his son's condition was 'critical' and he had undergone surgery for serious head injuries.

Miss Marchetti, who has dated Bianchi for a number of years, said: 'You are my champion! You are the strongest’.  She ended the tweet with emoticons of a heart and two hands locked in prayer.

'My champion'! Bianchi's long-term partner, Camille Marchetti, led prayers for the race ace's recovery as the world waited for news on his condition

Yesterday, Marussia issued a statement giving thanks for the support Bianchi had received. They also asked for ‘patience and understanding’ with regard to further medical updates.

This was after an initial release was made by the FIA on Sunday confirming the driver suffered ‘a severe head injury’ and was to undergo surgery before being moved to intensive care.

Marussia's statement read: ‘Following the accident involving Jules Bianchi during yesterday's 2014 Formula One Japanese Grand Prix at Suzuka Circuit, the Marussia F1 Team would like to acknowledge the huge outpouring of support and affection for Jules and the team at this very difficult time.

‘With regard to the communication of information concerning Jules' medical condition, we will respect, and be guided by, the wishes of the Bianchi family. Together with Jules' care, they will remain our highest priority.

‘Therefore, we would ask for patience and understanding with regard to further medical updates, which will be communicated in conjunction with the Mie General Medical Center in Yokkaichi, where Jules is being treated, when they feel it is appropriate.

‘Representatives of the Marussia F1 Team and Scuderia Ferrari will remain at the hospital to support Jules and the Bianchi family.’

Unconscious but breathing for himself, Bianchi was taken to Mie University hospital, ten miles from the track in Suzuka, and the race was stopped nine laps early. Bianchi's father has since told French television that his son's condition is 'critical' and he has undergone surgery for serious head injuries.

The F1 season moves on to Sochi in Russia for next weekend's race and it remains to be seen whether or not Marussia will take part.

Bianchi's crash saw Sunday's event halted at lap 44, with victory being awarded to Lewis Hamilton, who has opened up a ten-point lead in the championship over his second-placed Mercedes team-mate Nico Rosberg with four races remaining.

The race had been under threat of cancellation in the build-up as Typhoon Phanfone headed towards Suzuka and the wet weather led to it being red-flagged after just two laps, despite starting under safety car conditions.

Once enough standing water had been cleared to allow the race to begin in earnest, Briton Hamilton caught and passed Germany's Rosberg on lap 29 before disappearing into the distance.

The rain then came down again, driving conditions deteriorated and Bianchi crashed out, prompting the red flags to return and the race to be ended with nine laps to go.

Williams driver Felipe Massa has said he had been ‘screaming’ over his radio during the race about the amount of water on the track, but former FIA president Max Mosley believes ‘everything was done as it should have been’ in relation to safety.

Asked if F1 is doing everything right to secure the safety of its drivers, Mosley told Sky Sports News HQ on Monday: ‘I think it is. I think what happened in Suzuka was very unfortunate, a freak accident.

‘But I can't really fault any of the people involved - the marshals or the race director, any of those people. I think everything was done as it should have been.’

Massa said he was trying his best to get the race called off in the run up to Sutil and Bianchi's accidents.

‘I was already screaming on the radio five laps before the safety car that there was too much water on the track, but they took a bit too long and it was dangerous,’ the Brazilian said on Sunday. 

A subdued Hamilton said: ‘Our first thoughts go to Jules. It overshadows everything else when one of our colleague is injured and we are praying for him.

‘Next to this, the race result doesn't seem significant at all. Nico and I had a tough battle, we were pushing really hard... But like I said, that's not what matters - our thoughts are with Jules.’

Bianchi's long term partner, Miss Marchetti, is an osteopathy student at the Collège Ostéopathique de Provence in France who originally hails from the Mediterranean island of Corsica.

She is well-known in the Formula 1 community and is often seen cheering Bianchi on from the pits as he races around the world.

Known also for her glamorous attire and interest in fashion, she regularly accompanies him to F1 events and parties.

Bianchi is a graduate of the Ferrari academy and former Ferrari driver Felipe Massa and team principal Marco Mattiacci went with him to hospital.

It is the most serious accident to hit a race weekend since Felipe Massa fractured his skull and spent a week in a coma while qualifying for the Hungarian Grand Prix, in 2009.
