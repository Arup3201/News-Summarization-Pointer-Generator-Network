A man arrested by detectives trying to discover the fate of schoolgirl Alice Gross was released from custody last night.

The 51-year-old man was told he will face no further action over the disappearance of the troubled 14-year-old.

A second suspect, an unconnected 25-year-old man, who was held after a tip-off at the weekend, remained in custody.

The disappearance of Alice almost two weeks ago continues to baffle a team of Scotland Yard’s top investigators.

They insist they are conducting a missing person inquiry but have thrown the resources of a full murder investigation at the mystery.

Their focus remains a half-mile stretch of canal a short distance from her home in Hanwell, West London, where she was last seen. 

A team of frogmen have sealed off a half-mile stretch of the Grand Union Canal which has murky, litter strewn waters around 2m deep.

The centre of the search is close to where the canal joins the River Brent and where Alice’s rucksack was discovered last Thursday.

Police declined to reveal whether they have traced her treasured iPhone yesterday, but it is understood the device has been switched off.

Specialist forensic officers have also conducted searches at two homes linked to the 51-year-old suspect.

Both are located on streets which may have been close to her route on foot between the canal and her home.

The teenager was captured by a CCTV camera at a nearby lock as she walked in the direction of her home on the afternoon of Thursday August 28.

Her family have revealed Alice, a talented musician, had been going through a ‘tough time’ as she battled anorexia.

But they had no reason to expect she would not come home for dinner and have been left devastated by her disappearance.

Police have questioned many of her worried school friends at Brentside High School where she was a popular and successful student.

They are also examining many of her postings on social media, which include dozens of ‘selfie’ photographs and several intimate videos.

Alice, who weighed just 6st, was a prolific user of controversial website Ask.fm, which was at the centre of a cyberbullying storm last year.

The schoolgirl answered many questions from anonymous users on the site, including many of a deeply personal nature, including potential boyfriends, sex, weight and her appearance.

The schoolgirl was also a prolific user of Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, Skype and the messaging application Kik, a rival to Snapchat.

A Met Police spokesman said the force continues to appeal to five cyclists seen riding past Alice on the day she vanished to get in touch.

He said: ‘All lines of enquiry are still open at this time and this remains a missing person investigation at this stage.’
