A huge blast near a busy Damascus market and Syria's highest court today wounded at least three people and sent clouds of black smoke into the sky.

The explosion came as tensions threatened to spread across the region with neighbouring Turkey deploying anti-aircraft guns and other weapons alongside its border with Syria - nearly a week after Syrian forces shot a Turkish military plane out of the sky.

Major world powers will meet on Saturday in Geneva for talks on Syria, but few observers expect a major breakthrough.

Syria has the protection or Russia, a veto-wielding member of the UN Security Council, and has so far been impervious to international pressure.

Russian Foreign Minister Sergey 
Lavrov today said that Moscow will not endorse a call for President 
Bashar al-Assad to give up power. 

He
 said: 'We are not supporting and will not support any external 
meddling. External players must not dictate... to Syrians, but, first of
 all, must commit to influencing all the sides in Syria to stop the 
violence.'

It was not clear who was behind today's blast in Damascus.

Much of the violence that has gripped Syria since the uprising began has been sanctioned by the government to crush dissent.

But
 rebel fighters are launching increasingly deadly attacks on regime 
targets, and several massive suicide attacks this year suggest Al-Qaeda 
or other extremists are joining the fray.

Syria's state-run TV said the explosion was in the car park of the Palace of Justice, a compound that houses several courts.

Witnesses reported hearing one blast,
 but state-run television said two explosions struck the area. The 
report also said a roadside bomb was found but did not explode.

Syria has been hit by a wave of massive explosions in recent months, killing dozens of people.

Most
 of the explosions have targeted the security agencies of President 
Assad, who is fighting to end a 15-month-old uprising against his rule. 

Last
 month, an explosion targeted a military intelligence compound south of 
Damascus killing 55 people. It was Syria's deadliest blast in the 
uprising so far. 

Elsewhere
 in Syria, activists reported clashes between troops and rebels and said
 more than a dozen people were killed nationwide. Some of the heaviest 
battles were in the eastern city of Deir el-Zour. 

Activists say more than 14,000 people have been killed since the Syrian uprising began in March 2011.

Turkey,
 a former ally, has become one of the strongest critics of the Assad 
regime. Tensions between the two countries spiked following the downing 
of the Turkish plane last week.

Syria insists the Turkish military plane violated its air space last Friday. Turkey says the jet had unintentionally strayed into Syria's air space and was inside international airspace when it was brought down over the Mediterranean by Syria. 

The search for two missing pilots continued in Syrian waters but hopes for their survival are slim, Turkish authorities said. Research teams have found some pieces of the plane as well as equipment belonging to the pilots. 

A small convoy of military trucks towing anti-aircraft guns entered a military outpost in the border village of Guvecci, which faces a Syrian military outpost, according to TRT television footage.

Several anti-aircraft guns also have been deployed elsewhere alongside the border. Some trucks were seen carrying self-propelled multiple rocket launchers, the footage showed. 

Ties between Turkey and Syria have not been so low since the late 1990s, when the two countries almost went to war.

Tensions ran high in the 1980s and 1990s as Turkey developed military ties with Israel and Syria sheltered Turkish Kurd guerrilla leader Abdullah Ocalan.

Now, Turkey is hosting civilian opposition groups as well as hundreds of army defectors who are affiliated with the rebel Free Syrian Army.

Turkish President Abdullah Gul was holding a National Security Council meeting on Thursday, TRT said. The meeting, attended by Cabinet members and the military's top brass, is expected to focus on tensions with Syria.
