The brother of Jihadi John was a member of a group dubbed the 'Muslim mafia' in school and admired a controversial Islamic hate preacher, it has been claimed, as the first photographs of Omar Emwazi emerge.

The 21-year-old - whose older brother Mohammed was exposed as the infamous ISIS killer last week - is said to have supported Sheikh Khalid Yasin, who was lauded by Lee Rigby killer Michael Adebowale.

Omar had lived with Mohammed, 26, and both went to school together at Quintin Kynaston Academy in north west London, which was also attended by another ISIS member, Choukri Ellekhlifi.

Omar Emwazi, 21, was reportedly part of a so-called Muslim mafia in school and looked up to a controversial hate preacher. He is the younger brother of Mohammed Emwazi, revealed last week as the face behind Jihadi John's mask

Omar is said to have quickly taken down his Facebook page after his brother's new identity was revealed last week.

He reportedly used the site to 'like' Sheikh Yasin, a preacher who has called the Taliban his 'brothers' and denounced both Christian and Jewish beliefs as 'filth'.

Yasin has also claimed that the Koran gives men permission to 'beat women lightly' and has called homosexuality an 'aberration' that should be 'punishable by death'.

Michael Adebowale - who was jailed last year for the murder of Fusilier Lee Rigby - said Yasin's views taught him the 'purpose of life' and convinced him to convert to Islam.

Omar is believed to be being questioned in Kuwait, the home country of his father, Jassem, over Mohammed's involvement with ISIS, after they recently returned to the country from their house in west London.

A schoolfriend of Omar has said he was part of a group dubbed 'the Muslim Mafia' at Quintin Kynaston because of their devout religious views.

The unnamed woman told Victoria Ward of The Daily Telegraph: 'He was very religious but in an unobtrusive way.

'In every year there was a set that was the Muslim Mafia that hung out together and were very religious.'

The former schoolfriend insisted Omar was too much of a 'wimp' to be an extremist.

Omar is also said to have been a member of a group called Power of Dawah, who try to convert people to Islam in the street.

Quintin Kynaston - which has a large number of Muslim students - is set to undergo a review over how it handled radicalisation among its pupils.

The school, which is said to be completely different today from the time when the Emwazis attended, will be investigated by the Department of Education.

Its former the former headteacher, Jo Shuter, today insisted staff new nothing of any extreme influence of students.

She told Radio 4's Today programme: 'I'm not prepared to say when the radicalisation took place but all I can say is hand on heart that we had no knowledge of it.

'There was never any sense that any of these young men, as I knew them, were ever radicalised at the school.'

The Emwazi's father was a member of the 'Bidoun' group of stateless people denied citizenship by countries in the Gulf.

He worked as a police officer in Kuwait, where Mohammed was born, until he found his loyalties questioned after Saddam Hussein's 1990-1 invasion of the Gulf State because his family was originally from Iraq.

Mr Emwazi took his wife and his children to live in London in 1993, although he later returned and is now living in the Kuwaiti city of Jahra.

The family are now in Kuwait, where they are reportedly being questioned by the security services
