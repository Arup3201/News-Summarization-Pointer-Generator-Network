A  student in New Zealand has photographed two mysterious objects floating in the night sky above Otago Harbour, which he believes may be UFOs.

Terence Huang, 25, took the images in Dunedin in the country's south on Monday night but only noticed the two objects when he uploaded the photos to his laptop on Tuesday.

Mr Huang, originally from China, said he was with a friend when he set up his camera to take about 20 photos, but he didn't look as the images were snapped.

'I had a brief look at the photos last night, but it was late and cold so we went home,' Mr Huang told the Otago Daily Times.

Mr Huang said he had always believed in UFOs and the photos only strengthened his theory.

'Maybe in the future we will take more photos there to see if there is anything in them,' he said.

Australian Skeptics UFO spokesman Steve Roberts said photos featuring UFO-like objects were usually the result of a 'lens flare' from a source of light.

'Especially with digital cameras you get all sorts of effects,' Mr Roberts told MailOnline.

'It can be light from the sun bouncing around in the lens.

'You especially see it at night, even more so from a street light or any sharp, bright source of light.'

Mr Roberts said these 'orbs' were not visible to the naked eye and only showed up in photos.
