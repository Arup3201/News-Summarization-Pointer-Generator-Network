It is said the beauty of nature is best reflected in art, but as these pictures show, sometimes nature needs no help in reflecting itself.

The stunning symmetrical images capture the serene elegance of the natural world as if a giant mirror has been placed across the wilderness.

Photographer Mark Brodkin, 45, racked up months of research and spent hours at the locations in his quest for the perfectly symmetrical shot.

The intrepid snapper, from Toronto, Canada, said: 'I travel all over the world to photograph the most beautiful landscapes I can find.

'In my pursuit of incredible scenery I ventured to these locations. I spend months researching a location before I arrive using the internet extensively and other photo books to gain inspiration and information.

'Once I arrive in a location I typically scout the shooting area when the light is not great and then return for sunrise or sunset to shoot.

'Most of the time it takes several trips to the same location to get the image that I am seeking.'

Mr Brodkin uses trial and error to find the right composition and the perfect moment for each photograph he takes.

He added: 'It takes a great deal of patience, persistence and determination.

'These locations may only look this way for a few minutes - these are the minutes that I try to shoot.

'In some instances, I can drive my car right up to the shooting location and get the shot instantly.

'In other cases getting to the location can require extremely long hikes and camping overnight.

'Once I am in the location, I can spend several hours shooting, but the best images often some from the shots taken around sunrise or sunset.

'When the lighting is working and the location is right, you can really feel it.

'I know in my heart that I am capturing something beautiful.

'I also know that the light and colour will only last a short time, sometimes it is a matter of seconds.

'My adrenaline is rushing when I know there is an opportunity to get that 'winner' shot.'

Sparks Lake in Oregon: Mr Brodkin is by day a partner at a private equity firm and has been travelling the world since 2009 to capture some of the world's most picturesque spots

His favourite photograph, Pristine Bells, was captured at Maroon Bells in Aspen, Colorado, US, last month.

But it nearly proved his most difficult photograph yet.

He said: 'For months I looked forward to travelling to this location in October to shoot the beautiful Maroon Bells while the leaves were full of yellow.

'Days before my scheduled flight, I learned that the US government would be shut down and the road there was closed to vehicles.

'Discouraged, but still determined, I devised a back-up plan.

'In order to get to the location, I would take a mountain bike on a 12 mile return trip.

'The challenge was that it was eight degrees and snowing and I needed to make the trip alone in the dark at 3.30am.

'Still groggy from my flight in and a little scared, I hit the road and started the long ride to the bells.

'But when I arrived at sunrise I was treated to the most incredible view.

'I call this image 'Pristine Bells' and it is my favourite.'

Mr Brodkin is a partner at a private equity firm and has been travelling the world since 2009 to capture some of the world's most picturesque spots.

He added: 'There is so much that can go wrong with a mirrored landscape.

'Too many clouds, too few clouds or the slightest amount of wind can all ruin the image.

'So often I leave the location without a photograph, but when it all comes together it is incredible.'
