Contrary to what television dramas have shown us in recent years not every meth dealer is a criminal genius. 

Such is the case of California woman Sylvia Mashiah, who was busted with 27 pounds of methamphetamine Monday night after driving her car in a Customs lot specifically marked for suspect vehicles meant to be searched by federal agents.

Her car had not been ordered into that area, but thanks to her mistake she let investigators find the 17 packages of meth hidden in the rear quarter panels of her 2006 Ford Focus.

The Smoking Gun reports that Mashiah, 33, was alone in her vehicle at the time.

She was passing through the Otay Mesa Port of Entry at about 7:45 p.m., one of three border crossings that connects San Diego to Tijuana. 

The case's probably cause statement said she'd been cleared to enter the country after only a 'primary' inspection.

But, she 'mistakenly drove the vehicle to the secondary lot where Customs and Border Protection Officers inspected the vehicle.'

 Vehicles in that area are subject to a thorough driver questioning, close vehicle inspection, and even a canine inspection. 

It's usually the next step when an agent's suspicions are triggered by either a driver or passenger. 

The meth seized is enough to carry a felony drug importation charge.

If convicted she faces a minimum five-year sentence.

Her initial court appearance was this morning in U.S. District Court.
