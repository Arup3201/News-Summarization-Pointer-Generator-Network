A teenage girl's profiles on social networking sites reveal the vile messages from internet trolls that friends say pushed her to kill herself.

Jessica Laney, 16, was found dead at her home in Hudson, Florida, on Sunday night after users on social networking sites branded her 'fat', a 'slut' and tormented her over her looks and love life.

Messages on the teen's profile on Ask.fm - where people can post
questions anonymously on a user's page - show the constant abuse that friends claim pushed Jessica over the edge.

One user asks Jessica, 'Can you kill yourself already?' while another comments: 'Nobody even cares about you.'

'Bullied': Jessica Laney, 16, was found hanged at her home in Hudson, Florida, on Sunday after being bombarded with abuse on social networking sites, her friends have claimed

Jessica, who
 was a keen soccer player, also takes to the page to reveal her own 
turmoil, sharing her heartbreak at her troubled family life, school 
spats and concerns over her body.

'My brother and I don't talk 
anymore,' she wrote earlier this month. 'My dad, yeah he ignores me like
 I don't even f***ing exist. I have almost no friends I actually trust. 
My mom bitches at me for the littlest things. I am basically all alone.'

And in one now haunting post, she responded to a question asking what she thought about suicide.

'If
 you ever feel this low I just wanna say it's not your fault,' she wrote
 at the end of November. 'I know you feel useless, broken, not wanted 
and alone. I was there. But I promise you it will get better.

'You will get through the endless 
pain I promise school will be over soon and you can get away from the 
judgmental f***s. Nothing is worth it; it will all get better.'

'Victim': Friends said the bullying Jessica suffered occurred on her Ask.fm page, where people called her 'a slut'

Torment: Jessica's Ask.fm page - where users post anonymous questions - show her struggles

Her friends are now demanding the site is taken down, claiming the bullying led to Jessica's suicide.

'My friend Jessica Laney took her life,' friend Valeria Canales told ABC. 
'She was constantly bullied and bullied. And she was pushed and pushed to
 the point where she couldn’t handle it anymore.

'Ask.fm is a website where people 
can ask anonymous questions to anyone they want. And that's how Jessica 
was constantly put down and bullied... It needs to be shut down. 

'She was a beautiful girl & everyone loved her. Shes gonna be missed. We have to put an end to bullying. Please help.'

However, officials at Pasco County 
Sheriff's Office said neither Jessica's parents or boyfriend were aware 
of any bullying and said no formal complaint had ever been made to the 
school district.

'Our
 thoughts and prayers go to the Jessica Marie Laney's family as they 
deal with their loss,' Sheriff's spokesman Doug Tobi added.

Loss: Jessica had complained about her family and school life on her social networking pages

Missed: Jessica, who had a boyfriend, uploaded this picture to her Facebook profile at the weekend

Jessica Laney's friends are demanding that Ask.fm be closed after claiming messages posted on the social networking site led to the teen's suicide.

On the website, people can post anonymous questions to other users' profiles. It is said to have more than 20 million members.

On Jessica's profile, many of the questions are chatty and harmless, while others are cruel.

The Latvian-based site has also come under fire in recent months after it was linked to the deaths of two teenagers in Ireland.

Erin Gallagher, 13, was found dead days after warning users who had sent her abuse that she would kill herself. Six weeks earlier, Ciara Pugsley, 15, took her own life after being bombarded with hate messages on the site.

Its terms of service recommend 'by way of example, and not as a limitation' that users do not transmit 'offensive, threatening, harassing, libellous, hate-oriented, harmful' content.

On Tuesday, students at Fivay High School, where Jessica attended and played soccer, wore purple in remembrance of the teenager.

The students are also pushing for the website, Ask.fm, to be closed down.

'After I saw that, I thought they should just delete the website,' friend Laney Torres told ABC Action News. 'Nobody should have that, to have people say stuff like that on there.'

Around 3,000 people have signed a petition at Change.org to close the website.

Sheriff Chris Nocco said the messages on Ask.fm are disturbing and an investigation continues.

'What we can say is that we are going through the social network sites right now,' he said.

'We don't even know if a crime occurred. 
 It could have been nasty words that were said, that led this young girl
 to take the actions that she did.'

Ask.fm is a website where users
 can post anonymous questions to other users and is said to have more 
than 20 million members.

The Latvian-based site, which targets 13 to 18 year olds, previously came under fire after it was linked to the deaths
 of two teenagers in Ireland earlier this year.

The
 website's terms of service recommend 'by way of example, and not as a 
limitation' that users do not transmit 'offensive, threatening, 
harassing, libellous, hate-oriented, harmful' content.

And during a previous investigation, 
founder Mark Terebin posted: 'Ask.fm is just a tool which helps people 
to communicate with each other, same as any other social network, same 
as phone, same as piece of paper and pen.

Upset: Another post on the social networking site reveals Jessica's turmoil at her family and social life

Haunting: She also commented on suicide in November, writing that 'nothing is worth it'

Remembered: Friends set up a memorial Facebook group for the teen and demanded Ask.fm be shut down

'Don't blame a tool, but try to make 
changes... start with yourself... be more polite, more kind, more 
tolerant of others... cultivate these values in families, in schools.'

Laney's death has been classified as a
 suicide but the sheriff's office continues to investigate the events 
that led to her death.

More than 1,600 people have 'liked' a Facebook page set up in tribute to the teenager.

Kristi Clark said: 'Beautiful girl, 
inside and out. I had the pleasure of knowing her. Very sweet, bubbly 
personality, such a horrific shame at what has happened!'
