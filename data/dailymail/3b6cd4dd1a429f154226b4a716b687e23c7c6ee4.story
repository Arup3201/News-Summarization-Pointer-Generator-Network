The security footage looks unassuming at first: a Hawaiian Airlines jet parked at a gate at the Maui airport under overcast skies, and workers going through their regular routine.

Then, the 15-year-old's legs dangle briefly from the plane's belly and he drops to the concrete.

Hawaii transportation officials today released video of a California teen hopping from a jet's wheel well on April 20 after stowing away for a 5 1/2-hour flight.

The video largely confirms previous accounts given by FBI and airport officials of Yahya Abdi's seemingly unbelievable story: that he ran away from home, hopped a fence at Mineta San Jose International Airport and climbed into the wheel well of the closest plane.

Abdi survived the flight at 35,000 feet despite low oxygen and freezing temperatures.

Captured on camera: Hawaii transportation officials have released video of a California teen hopping from a jet's wheel (pictured) well after stowing away for a 5 1/2-hour flight to Maui

Disoriented: The footage shows 15-year-old Yahya Abdi jumped from the plane and stagger underneath the jet

Lost: The video shows Yahya Abdi, 15, walk under the plane's stairs and out of view after he jumped from the wheel well

Confusing: An airport worker stopped Yahya Abdi (pictured bottom left) near the plane and spoke with him for several minutes

The six minutes of security footage that the Hawaii Department of Transportation released show Abdi lowering himself from the Boeing 767 and jumping to the ground.

He sits on the concrete for 13 seconds, then gets up and slowly walks toward the front of the plane.

He wobbles slightly as he walks, pausing briefly a few times in the roughly 40 seconds it takes him to get under the passageway connecting the front of the airplane with the terminal.

Abdi walks up to an airport worker driving a cart, and the two chat for about three minutes before walking away together. The boy stays standing the whole time.

Hawaii Department of Transportation spokeswoman Caroline Sluyter said the footage was released after the state attorney general's office reviewed media requests.

San Jose, California, police spokesman Albert Morales said the Somali immigrant flew back to California over the weekend and was being cared for by Santa Clara County Child Protective Services.

Hiding place: Yahya Abdi climbed into the plane wheel well of Hawaiian Airlines jet (pictured) and lost consciousness after the plane took off

Survived: Yahya Abdi, 15 (pictured on stretcher) was loaded into an ambulance at Kahului Airport in Kahului, Maui, Hawaii and rushed to hospital after hiding in a plane's wheel well for five hours

The boy’s birth mother, who lives in a refugee camp in Ethiopia, said her son longed to see her and that the boy’s father falsely told him she was dead. Yahya’s siblings have denied those claims.

Yahya has not been charged with any crime, but San Jose Police said Monday that they are planning to interview him about how he climbed over a fence at San
 Jose International Airport and survived the flight.

'There are plans to speak to him,' police spokesman Albert Morales said.

Yahya’s father, Abdilahi Yusuf, who drives a taxi in San Jose, flew to Hawaii last week to bring his son home, but child welfare officials there turned the boy over to their California counterparts.

Authorities have searched the perimeter and found no signs of anyone going over or under the fence.
