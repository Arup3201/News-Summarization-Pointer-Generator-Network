A plane passenger got the shock of his life when he assaulted a man who was a former corrections officer.

Chad Hurst of Salt Lake City, Utah, says he pulled the young man aside after their flight from Denver, Colorado had landed on Sunday, and had a word with him about the foul language he had been using on the plane.

That is when the young man, who was carrying a skateboard, sucker punched Hurst.

Hurst then calmly proceeded to grab the young man by the shoulder, bring him to the ground, put his hands behind his back and get on top of him until police arrived on the scene. 

CBS Denver reports the young man was then charged with assault and public intoxication.

'In a former life I was a corrections officer about 10 years ago and my training was to never punch back. It was to control the situation and to take the person down,' said Hurst.

That is just what Hurst did too, with the entire incident lasting just a few seconds before the young man was on the ground.

As for what prompted the young man to hit him, Hurst later explained on Twitter; 'I asked him kindly to stop being vulgar.'

The young man has yet to be named by police.
