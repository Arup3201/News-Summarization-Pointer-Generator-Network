In 2010, one axe incident was reported in a West Midlands school. 

Other pupils have been found with daggers, flick knives, machetes and other forms of sharp implements. 

Detectives have also investigated crimes in schools involving acid, boiling water, cigarette burning and one concerning a rope.

According to the figures released, between 2009 and 2013, the most common weapon used in school in the West Midlands was a brick or a stone although over that period there were 177 incidents involving knives and other sharp implements.

A 16-year-old boy is due to stand trial for Mrs Maguire's death later this year. 

Abigail Kegg of the Ben Kinsella Trust said: 'Many of the young people we work with tell us that they don't feel safe in their own areas. Some want to carry a weapon thinking they are going to protect themselves but it can put them at more risk.'
