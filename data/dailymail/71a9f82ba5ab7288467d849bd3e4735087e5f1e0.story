Still those pesky Aussies cannot be beaten. England did almost everything right but came off second-best yet again against an under-strength home side in what became a thrilling finish at the Bellerive Oval.

This was a golden chance wasted for England who, thanks to a sublime 141 from Ian Bell, had Australia down and almost out only to endure a miserable last 10 overs with the bat and then just fail to defend a still decent 303 for eight.

At the centre of Australia’s third successive win in this Tri-series was Steve Smith, surely the most improved player in world cricket and now the match-winner in his first game as captain against England.

When Smith, leading Australia in the absence of the suspended George Bailey, was joined by England’s old bete noire in Brad Haddin, his side still needed 88 from 76 balls and the game was in the balance.

Yet the pair took their side to the brink and, even after Chris Woakes snared Haddin and induced a late wobble, Australia sneaked home with a ball in hand to leave England needing to beat India again in Perth next Friday to make sure of their place in the final of this pre-World Cup tournament.

‘I haven’t seen Australia produce death bowling like that for a very long time,’ said England captain Eoin Morgan. ‘They made things very difficult for us. We were dominant for the first 40 overs and looked set for a commanding total, probably 340, but we didn’t manage to get there.’

Morgan himself was out first ball, but he insisted that the bizarre case of a failed blackmail plot in the build-up did not distract him.

‘It hasn’t been distracting at all,’ he said. ‘I spoke to the ECB and I was very happy for them to deal with it. They just told me to focus on my cricket 100 per cent and I’ve done that. It wasn’t easy when I came in. The ball was reverse swinging. I nicked one. It happens.’

Australia's victory was secured in the final over of the tri-series match

Ian Bell hit a century against Australia to move past Paul Collingwood's previous record of 5,092 runs

This, though, was a magnificent effort from Bell. It was all very well hitting 187 in a warm-up match, but this was the real deal, a big hundred against Australia and easily the best and the quickest of his four one-day international centuries ahead of the World Cup.

In the process Bell passed 5,000 one-day runs and overtook Paul Collingwood as England’s leading runscorer in the format but the fact that 10 players worldwide have scored more than 10,000 tells you all you need to know about England’s under-achievement.

Here, Bell even outscored the designated hitter in Moeen Ali — at least until Ali smacked three sixes in successive balls from Pat Cummins — in a stand of 113 in fewer than 18 overs that bodes well for the World Cup battles ahead.

‘Belly has been awesome,’ said Morgan. ‘Since we touched down he’s really shown his experience and class. He’s led from the front in training and it’s really paid off. It’s a privilege to have someone like him in the squad.’

Warwickshire-born Bell is only the second Englishman to surpass 5,000 ODI runs for his country 

It should have provided the launch pad for an impregnable total but judged by the very highest standards England will be disappointed that they could not score at least 30 more.

When they were poised at 175 for two after 30 overs — and even when they stood at 244 for two after 40 — England looked set for 350 but they had a miserable final 10 overs when the platform was built for their hitters.

Joe Root proved the perfect foil for Bell in a stand of 121 from 19 overs but a middle order packed with dynamism stalled and spluttered.

Yes, Australia’s bowling at the death, mainly from Mitchell Starc, proved mightily effective but England should have managed more than 59 off the last 10 overs for the loss of six wickets, three falling off the last three balls.

Ravi Bopara should ask himself how he could score only seven off 16 balls while Jos Buttler was not much better with 25 from 24 balls.

It felt as if England had fallen short but when Steven Finn found early reverse swing and took two wickets in three balls they were favourites for an important victory. But while Smith, a run machine in the Test series against India, was still there England could not rest easy and even when Australia lost their finisher James Faulkner they were still able to pace their chase almost perfectly.

Smith finished unbeaten on 102, with Starc scurrying the winning run off his first ball, and England were left wondering what might have been.

‘It’s frustrating but it’s still early in the trip and we’re making strides,’ said Morgan. ‘Today was a learning curve for us.’

Australia’s psychological hold continues ahead of their World Cup opener against England in Melbourne on February 14. But only just.
