A father-of-two claims he spent the night in a hospital storage room with a brass bell to call for help and his drip dangling from a light fighting.

With no other beds available Paul Ross-Bowker slept surrounded by oxygen cannisters and medical supplies, just three days after surgeons removed his appendix.

His mother said the conditions were so bad, she 'half expected to see Florence Nightingale'.

But while expressing her shock at her son's situation, Ms Ross-Bowker said she cannot fault the staff who cared for him.  

Mr Ross-Bowker was taken to Gwynedd Hospital in Bangor on Monday after complaining of pain in his abdomen. 

Paul Ross-Bowker claims he was moved to a hospital 'storage room'. His mother Pauline, said while she was shocked at her son's situation she cannot fault the care he received from staff at the hospital

That night, the 35-year-old had an operation to have his appendix removed, before he was taken back to his bed on one of the hospital wards.

His mother Pauline said her son was still in excruciating pain the next day, and doctors subsequently discovered his wound was infected.

They prescribed him the painkiller morphine, and put him on an antibiotic drip to try and combat the infection.

In the early hours of Thursday morning staff woke Mr Ross-Bowker and told him he needed to be moved because his bed was needed.

But instead of moving the IT worker from Brynsiencyn on Anglesey to another ward, he was taken to a side room.

Staff told him it was a 'treatment, assessment, storage room'.

A spokesman for the health trust which runs the hospital said the room was a treatment room where clinical procedures are routinely carried out. 

But not being a part of the general ward, there was no alarm system to call staff so Mr Ross-Bowker was instead given a brass bell to call nurses if he needed to.

There were oxygen cannisters on the floor, as well as boxes of medical supplies.

And his family said his drip was hung from the ceiling via a light fitting, preventing the 35-year-old from going to the toilet.

His mother said while being shocked by her son's situation, she cannot fault the staff who cared for him. 

She said: 'It was a converted store cupboard which they have shoved an old bed into.

The 35-year-old had his appendix removed at Gwynedd Hospital in Bangor, north Wales, on Monday. But in the early hours of Thursday morning he was moved to the side room. He said he was given a brass bell and was surrounded by oxygen cannisters and other medical supplies

'How clean would this room have been? Certainly not as clean as the wards. He had just had surgery and had an infected wound.

'He was given a brass bell and the drip was attached to the light fitting, it was like going back to the dark ages. I half expected to see Florence Nightingale walking down the corridor.'

She added: 'The doctor came to him the next morning and asked him if he wanted to stay or go home. 

'Paul said if he had to spend another night in there he would rather go home, despite being in the same amount of pain he was in before his operation. The doctor said he didn't blame him.

'The situation is ridiculous, they haven't got enough beds and are closing wards and hospitals.'

Ms Ross-Bowker contacted Ynys Môn Welsh Assembly Member Rhun ap Iorwerth about her son's experience. 

He said: 'I was shocked to hear of the conditions that one of my constituents had to endure at Gwynedd Hospital this week.

'Surely this can't be right in the 21st century? Especially considering a person is at his or her weakest at hospital, expecting them to use a brass bell to call for help is incredible.

'My constituent was full of praise for the nurses working on the ward, but they are obviously being made to work in difficult conditions with a clear lack of resources, and I will be raising this with the health board as well as the Welsh government at the first opportunity.'

Professor Matthew Makin, Executive Medical Director at Betsi Cadwaladr University Health Board said: 'Firstly we would like to apologise to the patient for any distress caused.

'As part of the Health Board’s Escalation Policy, when we’re under significant pressure and unable to off load patients from ambulances, we increase ward capacity in a safe manner, ensuring patient dignity at all times. 

'The patient was nursed in an appropriate clinical area on the ward, in this instance a treatment room.

'This practice is only done in extreme circumstances and is closely monitored to ensure patient safety at all times. 

'We would like to reassure the public that these instances are temporary and patients are allocated to bed spaces on wards as soon as they become available.'
