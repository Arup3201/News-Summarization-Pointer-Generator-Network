Manchester United legend Paul Scholes believes there is still time for Ravel Morrison to turn his career around, despite an exit from West Ham United looking increasingly likely.

Morrison was handed one of the biggest accolades a young player could ever receive when he was touted as a possible successor to Scholes in the United midfield.

Off-field antics ended his United dream, and his two year spell at Upton Park appears to be ending in similar fashion, but Scholes is adamant it's not too late for Morrison to turn it around.

'The problems Ravel has had in his life have been well documented and it is fair to say that I saw first-hand the issues he presents when our careers overlapped at Manchester United,' Scholes wrote in his Independent column.

'What I can also say is that he has remarkable skill and vision for a footballer. I saw a lot of great young prospects at United but he really stood out on the days when he wanted to shine.

'No one could have done more for him than Warren Joyce, the club's reserve team manager and latterly the Under 21s coach, who went out of his way to try to understand what made Ravel tick.

'If there is one consolation it is that Ravel is still young. He turns 22 next month. There is time for him to turn his career around.'

The midfielder had a spell on loan at Championship club Cardiff earlier in the season, but Bluebirds' boss Russell Slade ended the loan early, stating he had no future at the club.

Morrison has been linked with a move to Italian side Lazio in recent weeks but may have to wait until the summer to secure a permanent deal away from Upton Park.
