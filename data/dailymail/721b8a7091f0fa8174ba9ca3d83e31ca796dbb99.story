He had been a lifelong fan, patiently sticking with his Cleveland football team through thick and thin.

But it would appear that loyal Scott E. Entsminger had one last wish for the Browns - and saved it for his obituary.

The season ticket holder said he: 'He respectfully requests six Cleveland Browns pall bearers so the Browns can let him down one last time.'

He got the last word! Scott Entsminger, a lifelong Browns fan, shares his last request in his obituary

The team will present a Groza No 76 jersey with Entsminger's name printed on the back to the family

The 55-year-old, of Mansfield, Ohio, died on July 4 at his home - but not before penning a song every year to send it to the Cleveland Browns as 'as well as offering other advice on how to run the team', his online obituary at The Columbus Dispatch said.

And he certainly got the last word in with his request that six of the team carry his coffin to his funeral.

In the obituary, his family asked everyone to wear their Cleveland Browns clothing to the service in honor of the General Motors worker.

The Colombus-born father was described as a 'fun loving, kind and caring man who enjoyed gardening and fishing but his greatest enjoyment was spending time with his family'.

The Browns had a dismal start to their 2012 season by losing their first five games, and fans are used to losses from the team

Dejected Cleveland Browns fans have branded the team's stadium the 'factory of sadness'

When the Browns heard about Entsminger's last request, they contacted his widow, Pat, and discovered that Scott's favorite player was Hall of Fame entrant Lou Groza, the NFL reported.

The team will present a Groza No 76 jersey with Entsminger's name printed on the back to the family today.

The Browns haven't enjoyed the most stellar of results lately.

Their own fans have branded their stadium the 'factory of sadness', and recently endured some humiliating losses.

The Browns had a dismal start to their 2012 season by losing their first five games.

Having lost their last six games to end the 2011 season, this marked an eleven-game losing streak, tied for the longest in team history with the 1974–75 teams.
