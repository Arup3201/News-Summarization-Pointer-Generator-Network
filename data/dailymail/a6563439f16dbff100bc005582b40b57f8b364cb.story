A convicted felon has tweeted his way to an arrest after a police officer began surreptitiously following him on Twitter.

Officer Brian Delahunty of the Boston Police Department became one of Kwmaine Davis's 329 follows on Twitter as part of the Youth Violence Strike Force.

Davis, 23, is a convicted felon associated with H-Bloc, a gang that operates in Roxbury.

Incriminating: A pleased-looking Davis holds two pistols in a photo he posted to Twitter which subsequently got him arrested

Posting as DopeMan @supafreakmaino, Davis shares pictures of food, friends and memes - interspersed with more illicit images.

He posted two pictures to the social network in February of himself shooting guns at a firing range.

The images, showing Davis with a Smith & Wesson .44 caliber handgun and a Sig Sauer .380 caliber pistol at a Salisbury shooting range, were enough for Delahunty to act.

As a convicted felon, Davis is not allowed to possess a firearm - not even, as The Smoking Gun reports, one from a firing range.

Delahunty alerted the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives, which initiated a probe into the photographs.

A criminal complaint was then filed against Davis for possessing a firearm.

Davis was arrested on Wednesday by federal agents and will remain in custody until his hearing on May 9.

According to The Smoking Gun, Davis's associated with H-Bloc was reason enough to deny him bail.

The H-Block gang, so called because it operates in an area just north of Franklin Park where most of the street names begin with H, is well-known to police.

The Smoking Gun reports that its members wear silver and black clothing emblazoned with the Raiders logo.

Police say Davis's target practice was 'intended to increase his firearm proficiency for illegal purposes rather than for any sporting or recreational reason.'
