Former lorry driver Tom Naylor, 58, is taking his neighbour to court in a bid to settle a bitter boundary dispute over a 3ft strip of land

A £15.5 million lottery jackpot winner is taking his neighbour to court in a bid to settle a bitter boundary dispute over a 3ft strip of land - for just a few thousand pounds.

Former lorry driver Tom Naylor, 58, and his wife Rita, 56, won the multi-million pound windfall in 2001.

They moved into a luxury £480,000 luxury barn conversion with two acres of land in the picturesque village of Wheaton Aston, Staffordshire

But after retreating to the countryside, Mr Naylor became embroiled in a bitter turf war over a tiny plot of grass which skirts around the southern edge of his property.

Sections of the disputed area are owned by three neighbouring businesses but nobody can agree who owns the 3ft (0.9m) wide strip of land that runs for just 150 metres along the boundary.

Incredibly, Mr Naylor is now taking restaurant owner Zillar Rahman to court over the 'petty' dispute which is expected to cost him thousands of pounds in legal bills.

His demands, which are detailed in a county court claim form, include £900 for putting up a new fence.

The lottery winner also wants additional costs for repairing the sewer system, damages for alleged trespass and all legal costs and fees.

In his claim, multi-millionaire Mr Nayor says he is expecting to recover 'more than £5,000 but not more than £15,000'.

The former HGV driver says Mr Rahman, who owns the Cafe India restaurant to the south of his property, demolished his boundary fence in April 2012.

He also alleges the neighbour tampered with a manhole cover that sealed a foul drainage system - causing raw sewage to flood his paddock and driveway.

But Mr Rahman disputes the claims and says the millionaire illegally put up the boundary fence in 2012 in a bid to claim land that didn't belong to him.

He also says it was Mr Naylor driving wooden fence posts into the ground that caused the dirty contents of the burst sewage pipe to flood back onto his own land.

Vowing to fight for the small plot of grass today, Mr Rahman, 39, said: 'As far as I am concerned the land belongs to me.

'When he put up the fence he moved the posts a few yards onto my land and it caused all the damage to the sewers.

'I had to take it down to get the manhole cover repaired. The job cost me thousands of pounds to fix a problem he caused.'

Neighbour Chris Rawlins, 61, whose home is sandwiched between Mr Naylor's luxury barn conversion and Cafe India, added: 'I have seen the plans and in my opinion the land does not belong to Mr Naylor.

'The boundary is a straight line running the length of his property up to Staffordshire Motor Homes.

'He is trying to say there is a dog leg but the plans don't show that at all.'

The two parties tried to sort out their differences through mediation in May this year but talks broke down.

And now, Mark English, who is from Shakespeare Solicitors representing Mr Naylor, confirmed the claim was going through the court process.

He declined to comment on the details but speaking in February this year Mr Naylor, who says he still plays the lottery every week, claimed the land belonged to his property.

The millionaire, who spent £375,000 on the barn in April 2002, said: 'It may look like a straight line on the map but that's because the drawings are so small.

'I have photographs showing where the original boundary was and the original owner of the land has backed me up.

'The restaurant owner flattened my fence and left my land in a terrible state when he employed workmen to raise a manhole cover two years ago.

'It's quite simple really. I want my land back and my fence put back up.'

Earlier this year, residents accused Mr Naylor of having 'nothing better to do' since retiring from his job as a HGV driver following the huge jackpot win.

Andy Smith, who runs Weston Motor Company, added: 'These disputes haven't really affected us so far but he's not short of land that's for sure.

'I suspect he's just doing it because he has nothing better to be doing these days.'

The case is now due to be heard at Stafford County Court early next year.
