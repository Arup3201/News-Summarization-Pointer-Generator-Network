Mario Balotelli made use of the two days off Liverpool manager Brendan Rodgers gave his team by visiting his former AC Milan team-mates in Italy on Tuesday.

The Italian international turned up at their training session to watch the squad prepare for their Serie A match with Fiorentina this Monday, and uploaded a photo to his Instagram of him with Stephan El Shaarawy.

Balotelli wrote ‘Milan, what a pleasure to see you’ as he visited the club he left for £16million to join Liverpool in August.

He has struggled for form at Anfield, having scored just four goals in 24 appearances under Rodgers.

The Liverpool boss gave his team two days off following their 0-0 draw with Blackburn Rovers in the FA Cup quarter-finals, but will have his team back in training at Melwood on Wednesday ahead of visiting his former club Swansea City.

Balotelli played 31 minutes against Blackburn but the 24-year-old will hope to get more time on the pitch at the Liberty Stadium.

The Italian international has found goals hard to come by since joining Liverpool in the summer
