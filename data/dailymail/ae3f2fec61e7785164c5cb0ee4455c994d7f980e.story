Sony Pictures has reportedly suspended all filming in the wake of a devastating hacker attack that has crippled the company's ability to make payments.

The entertainment giant is allegedly unable to make transactions, or make any use of a huge number of computers, after a hacking cell linked to North Korea disabled its security measures and stole valuable information.

As well as disabling key elements of their network, hackers also took and leaked a trove of embarrassing e-mails, which revealed the a top executive made a racist jibe at Obama, insulted Angelina Jolie, and tinkered with the storyline of a film about North Korea.

A source told the Times of London that the company can't process any payments, which has in turn led third parties to cancel shoots. The scale of the suspension was not immediately clear.

MailOnline has contacted Sony Pictures for comment. 

The revelation on Friday is the latest in a damaging chain of revelations linked to the action, seemingly with the aim of preventing the release of The Interview, a film in which North Korean dictator Kim Jong-un is assassinated.

In emails that were leaked on Thursday, Sony Corporation Chief Executive Officer Kazuo Hirai wrote to Amy Pascal asking that scenes from the movie featuring Jong-un be removed or edited.

Pascal then shared the information with the film's star, writer and director, Seth Rogen, who was none too happy.

'This is now a story of Americans changing their movie to make North Koreans happy,' wrote Rogen in an email to Pascal obtained by Bloomberg News.

'That is a very damning story.'

Pascal tried to explain herself to Rogen, saying; 'As embarrassing as this has been from my point of view, you have to appreciate the fact that we haven't just dictated to you what it had to be.'

She then adds, 'This isn't some flunky. It's the chairman of the entire Sony Corporation who I am dealing (with).'

In another email she cites the proximity of North Korea to Japan as another reason changes might be necessary.

'I haven’t the foggiest notion how to deal with Japanese politics as it relates to Korea so all I can do is make sure that Sony won’t be put in a bad situation and even that is subjective,' she tells Rogen. 

Rogen agrees to make the changes, though Pascal does put in an email to Hirai that there was some 'resistance from the filmmakers.' 

The changes, which have to do with a major plot point, seem to take some time to deal with, and Rogen completes the task to Hirai's liking it would seem by October, writing in his final email, 'Please tell us this is over now.'

And while he may have been annoyed and angered, Rogen is still very much a fan of Pascal, praising her Thursday evening at the premiere of the film.

'We want to thank Amy Pascal for having the balls to make this movie,' said Rogen. 

Ironically, however, the film is not set to open in Asia.

The changes are also described in the emails, though they spoil the film, which is set to open on December 25. 

This is just the latest email leak from a group calling themselves The Guardians of Peace, who, as previously mentioned, want to stop the release of The Interview.

Pascal said in an interview Thursday that every employee's email from the past 10 years was obtained in the hack, meaning these leaks could go on for weeks or even months.

It is believed that a group from North Korea is behind the hack. 

The scenes that were changed are detailed in the emails, and show what an amusing and out there film The Interview will be 

WARNING: Spoilers!

In one email, Pascal writes to Harei: 'In shot #337 there is no face melting, less fire in the hair, fewer embers on the face, and the head explosion has been considerably obscured by the fire, as well as darkened to look less like flesh.'

She then adds, 'We arrived at this shot (#337) after much cajoling and resistance from the filmmakers.'

In another email, Doug Belgrad, president of Sony Pictures Entertainment motion picture group, wrote to Pascal: 'In the interest of getting this approved, I would still like to see them eliminate the tendril of flesh on the left side of his forehead that comes just before the fireball.'

Harei also requested that the scene where Jong-un's head explodes not be shown in any versions of the film outside the United States.
