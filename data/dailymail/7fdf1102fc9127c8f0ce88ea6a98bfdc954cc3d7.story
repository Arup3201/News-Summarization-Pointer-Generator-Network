Yasmin Rajah's story first came to the public eye when her husband, Ryan Price, wrote a heart-breaking love letter to their local radio station B105, pleading with the show's producers to help him make his wife's dream a reality.

The letter explained that at 29-years-of age, Yasmin was diagnosed with 'very rare Stage three cancer (Mature Teratoma with a malignant adenocarcinoma differentiation) after a grapefruit sized tumour was removed off her right lung through open heart surgery'.

Yasmin Rajah, a Brisbane mother-of-two who was diagnosed with a rare form of cancer, has finally had her dying wish granted and married her partner Ryan Price

Yasmin and Ryan have been together for eight years and have two young sons Josiah (left) and Jazz (right)

'I am writing to tell you this because I am desperate. I want to marry this beautiful woman and mother to my sons now if there is a chance I may not be able to in six months but funds and know-how are two things I have little to none of,' Ryan’s letter said.

'I know there are those out there in worse cases than this but I am asking because my partner deserves it, my children deserve it and I want nothing more than to see them smile.'

In an interview with Channel 9's A Current Affair, Ms Rajah said that she did not have long to live and that her sons, five-year-old Josiah and eight-year-old Jazz were her biggest concern.

'I may not be around past Christmas and expected case is a couple of years,' she said.

Overwhelmed with medical costs, the couple married with funds raised by radio station B105, A Current Affair and donations from businesses and the public

'I think to myself all day, what about my boys... what can I do to make sure they don't forget me?' she said.

After eloping with the help of B105, A Current Affair and donations from businesses and the public, Yasmin said 'I feel complete' while her husband added, 'it’s like the final piece of the puzzle'.

'It means a lot to be a complete family unit, it might just be a piece of paper to some people but to me it's absolutely not,' Yasmin told A Current Affair.

' I am asking because my partner deserves it, my children deserve it and I want nothing more than to see them smile,' Ryan's letter said

Ms Rajah said that she would be lucky to live past Christmas and that her sons were her biggest concern

The couple are now getting ready to go on their dream holiday – a family vacation to Disney Land in Los Angeles, sponsored entirely through a public donations account set up by Flight Centre which has reached almost $20,000.

But as her condition worsens, Yasmin's cancer continues to worsen, with it now affecting her bones and spine and reducing her chance of survival to just five per cent.

Her partner Ryan described Ms Rajah's condition as a sinking boat.

'It means a lot to be a complete family unit, it might just be a piece of paper to some people but to me it's absolutely not,' Yasmin said

'There's a hole in it and no matter how much water you scope out, it's not helping - it just sinks,' he said.

'I love her with cancer, I love her without cancer, I love her with hair, I love her without hair.'

'I hope that if things don't go as well as expected, that they (her sons and partner) know that I love them - that's it', Yasmin said.
