Banned: Asma al-Assad, can no longer travel or shop in the EU comes as diplomats try to crank up pressure on her husband to end a bloody crackdown on popular unrest

Her days of shopping in the EU for the president's palace are over, as ministers have decided the wife of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad is no longer welcome.

The ban on travel and shopping in the EU, will come as a blow to Asma  al-Assad, whose love of pricey purchases has been well documented in the past few weeks in leaked emails.

They detailed Asma placing an order for £10,000 worth of candlesticks, concern over getting hold of a new chocolate fondue set from Amazon, and swapping details with friends of crystal-encrusted designer shoes costing nearly £4,000.

The announcement comes as diplomats try to crank up pressure on his government to end a bloody crackdown on popular unrest.

Her name is now among 12 people added to the sanctions list, which already includes her husband.

The list will be released over the weekend, but diplomats confirmed the list includes Mr. Assad's mother, sister as well.

They said that Mr. Assad's 36-year-old wife would be subject to the EU's asset freeze and banned from traveling to all EU member states except the U.K.

British authorities will decide whether they prevent her entering the country and a U.K. diplomat said it is premature for a decision on the issue.

Speaking ahead of a meeting of EU foreign ministers in Brussels, EU's foreign policy chief, Baroness Ashton, said sanctions were ''a really important tool.'

UK Foreign Secretary William Hague said it was 'very important to increase the pressure on the Syrian regime.'

A British-born former investment 
banker who had once cultivated an image of a woman inspired by Western 
values, Asma al-Assad has become a hate figure for many Syrians.

Luxury: shop Leaked emails detailed Asma swapping details with friends about designer shoes costing and concern over getting hold of a new

She
has stood by her husband during a year-long crackdown on popular unrest
in which the U.N. says at least 8,000 people have died.

Last week activists released some 3,000 emails they said were from private accounts belonging to Mr Assad and his wife.

The messages, which have not been independently verified, suggested Mrs Assad continued to shop online for luxury goods 
while Syria descended into bloodshed.

She comes across as a shallow 
ingenue, focused on internet shopping rather than the horrific plight of
the people she professes to care for.

The EU has 
responded to Syria's violence with a broad range of sanctions, which 
include a ban on Syrian oil imports to Europe and measures against the 
Syrian central bank and other companies and state institutions.

Foreign
ministers of EU member states are set to agree on a new round of 
measures, the bloc's 13th, and impose asset freezes and bans on travel 
to the EU against 12 people, include Asma.

A prohibition for European companies to do business with two more Syrian entities is also planned.

'The
text (of sanctions) has gone through,' said one EU diplomat, referring 
to an agreement reached by EU envoys in Brussels to a list of new 
sanctions. Another diplomat confirmed Assad's wife is included in the 
list of sanctioned individuals.

The list still needs formal approval 
from ministers. It will become public on Saturday when new sanctions are
due to go into effect.

Assad himself has been a target since May last year, but sanctions have had little impact on his policies so far.

Destruction: A house is destroyed by Syrian government shelling in Rastan town in Homs - the U.N. says at least 8,000 people have died during the crackdown on violence

Violence has intensified in recent weeks as pro-government forces bombard rebel towns and villages, looking to sweep their lightly armed opponents out of their strongholds.

The international community has struggled to formulate a joint approach in the face of opposition from Russia and China to any resolution by the U.N. Security Council.

Assad absorbed a major diplomatic blow on Wednesday, however, when Russia and China joined the Security Council in voicing support for U.N.-Arab League envoy Kofi Annan's bid to end violence that has brought Syria to the brink of civil war.

Asma Assad

Asma Assad, 36, (pictured) grew up in Acton, West London where she was known as 'Emma'.

She is the daughter of consultant cardiologist Fawaz Akhras and retired diplomat Sahar Otri, both Sunni Muslims.

Her parents moved from Syria to London in the Fifties so that her father, who is now based at the Cromwell Hospital and in Harley Street, could get the best possible education and medical training.

Asma, who holds dual citizenship, 
British and Syrian, was educated at a Church of England school in Ealing
before attending a private girls’ day school - Queen’s College, Harley 
Street.

From Queen’s, 
where she achieved four A-levels, Asma went to King’s College London to 
read Computer Science and take a diploma in French Literature.

She
graduated with a First and, after six months of travelling, joined 
Deutsche Bank as an analyst in hedge-fund management. She then moved to 
the investment bank JP Morgan and worked in Paris and New York, as well 
as London. On family holidays back in Syria, she met Bashar.

Then he, too, came to London to study ophthalmology, though he had to leave early to return to Syria after his elder brother Basil, who had been the heir, died in a car crash.

Asma started seeing him in secret, resigning from JP Morgan just a month before the wedding without being able to explain the real reason. With her father, she has set up several London-based charities such as the Syria Heritage.

Vogue has described her as ‘the freshest and most magnetic of first ladies’ and has topped French Elle’s ‘most stylish woman in politics’ list. In Damascus, Bashar and Asma now live in a flat with plate-glass windows and their three boys go to a Montessori school.

Asma speaks four languages and her connections with France have led her to persuade the Louvre to help her open Syrian cultural attractions.
