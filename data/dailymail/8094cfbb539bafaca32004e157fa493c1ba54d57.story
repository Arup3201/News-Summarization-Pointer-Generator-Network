Following angry tweets, comments and complaints, Apple has now made it much easier to get rid of the U2 album that was added to millions of iCloud accounts last week.

The tech giant has created a dedicated page that lets users remove Songs Of Innocence simply by signing in with their Apple ID.

Apple announced at its iPhone 6 launch event that the Irish band's latest album would be added to every iTunes Store account, in 119 countries around the world, for free.

This isn't the first time Apple has been in trouble for controlling music on devices. Earlier this year, the firm automatically added U2's Songs of Innocence album to millions of iOS devices without permission. It was then forced to create a dedicated page (pictured) that made it easy for disgruntled users to remove the files

Unfortunately for Apple and U2, many of 
these customers were not happy the Songs Of Innocence album had been 
forced upon them – and took to Twitter and Facebook to voice their upset .

Go to Apple's removal page, click Remove Album and enter your Apple ID.

The album will be automatically removed from your account.

The album 
was distributed to iTunes users via iCloud, which means it appears in 
the Music app on devices, but isn’t physically stored on the computer, 
phone or tablet until it has been downloaded.

If
 it has been downloaded, users can swipe to the left on each song and 
click Delete, but unless they use the recently created page, the album 
will still sit in the account.

To
 hide the album from iTunes manually, users must log into their account,
 find the album and click the cross in the top left-hand corner of the 
cover image.

The
 album may also appear if the phone has the auto-download feature 
enabled. To turn this off, go to Settings, iTunes & App Store, then 
disable Automatic Downloads.

Unless users remove the album, using Apple's latest link, the songs will still be 
played in Shuffle mode.

A manual fix for this is to create a custom playlist on an iOS device and exclude U2’s Songs of 
Innocence from it.

And Apple reportedly paid the band $100 million as part of the deal.

The New York Times claimed: 'To release U2’s album free, Apple paid the band and Universal an unspecified fee as a blanket royalty and committed to a marketing campaign for the band worth up to $100 million, according to several people briefed on the deal.' 

The majority of users complained the album was added without their permission, while others simply don’t like U2.

Twitter user @@HayleyMuir said: '#Apple outrage; notified earlier I've no storage for pics, to discover I've attained a U2 album I DON'T WANT & can't delete #p*****d OFF!!!!'

While @HTFCMac tweeted: 'If iTunes even thinks of putting U2 on my computer I may go into full on #OUTRAGE', which was seconded by @Roxiestargazer, who said: 'All these U2 songs appearing on my phone? This is an outrage.'

A number of users also referenced the wider security implications.

‏User @MezMerrett tweeted: ‘If Apple can forcefully download a U2 album onto everyone's phone, imagine what else they can do and see.’

 Songs of Innocence album (pictured) was automatically added to iOS 
devices following Tuesday’s iPhone 6 launch event. Apple said it was a 
gift for any iTunes Store customers in 119 countries. Users have 
complained they didn't want the album, and moaned the album is difficult
 to permanently delete (pictured right)

There were also joke tweets being posted. Journalist and coder Owen Williams tweeted Apple’s chief executive Tim Cook, asking how to uninstall ‘a virus called U2’ on his phone (pictured)

And @MattRichardson3 added: ‘Everyone's scared of MI6 and GCHQ accessing our phones, but I'd rather that than be forcibly given a U2 album.’

Even TV presenter Graham Norton was put out by the album appearing on his device: ‘Sorry to sound like Grandad but the new U2 album just showing up in my iTunes by magic is freaking me out!’

User @uvray_ added: ‘WARNING: DO NOT click on links offering free downloads of the new U2 album. They lead to free downloads of the new U2 album.’
