Mention the word dumb blonde to this teenager and she's likely to reach for the dumb bells.

At the tender age of 16, Bronwyn Taylor, from Inverness in Scotland, is Britain’s strongest schoolgirl.

She had planned to become a hairdresser, but after taking up powerlifting a year ago her athletic potential went from strength to strength.

Just 12 months after taking up the sport, Bronwyn has stunned her friends and family by breaking three British records at the Commonwealth Powerlifting Federation Championships.

Packing some punch: Bronwyn Taylor, Britain's strongest schoolgirl, only took up powerlifting a year ago

She can lift twice her own body 
weight and became the strongest under-18 at a competition in Bournemouth
last month by hefting a combined weight of 247.5 kilograms (38st 13lb).

Fifth year student Bronwyn - who is 5 
feet 10 ins and weighs 11 stone 4lb - is now training for the Olympics 
and hopes to compete in the 2016 games.

Bronwyn said: 'I was very nervous as I
knew it was going to be a big event, but it felt amazing to break the 
British record - I couldn’t believe it.

'I was in shock all day. I really 
enjoy powerlifting, I have tried to get a few of my friends at school 
into it but they aren’t interested.

'They think they will end up looking like the Incredible Hulk, but that’s not true. My mum is really proud of me.'

She set records the under-18 
category at the Commonwealth Powerlifting Federation Championships in 
overall weight (247.5kg), bench press (50kg) and dead lift (125kg) and 
the squat lift section with a hurculean effort of 72.5kg.

Bronwyn 
was inspired to take up powerlifting - which uses a different technique 
to weightlifting - when training in boxing and karate in December 2010.

She began to hit the gym with her dad
Andrew, 43, who runs a removals firm, and with his help quickly 
discovered her talent for powerlifting.

Bronwyn began training almost every day around her studies at Culloden Academy, Inverness, and competed just months later.

She broke the Scottish record in 
October by lifting a combined weight of 260 kilograms (40 st 13lbs) at 
the Scottish Open championships in Glasgow.

The record did not count as a British record because it was not completed at the British competition.

Both her British and Scottish 
record-breaking weights are compiled from three lifts, the bench press, 
the deadlift and the squat, standard practice for measuring record 
attempts in the sport.

Bronwyn’s mother Florence accompanies her daughter to Peak Physique Gym, near their home in Inverness to help her train.

Florence, 46, said: 'I’m astonishingly proud. She’s only been doing it since Christmas 2010.

'She got the idea when she was in the
gym building up strength for other sports and she decided she enjoyed 
it so she began competing.

'We were surprised at first but she 
had grown up with gym talk because her dad Andrew is into fitness and 
always spoke about the gym when she was a child.

'It’s quite funny because Andrew runs a removals firm and people are shocked when Scotland’s strongest girl turns up to help.

'Her younger brother Cosmo now wants to get into it but he has to wait a few years because he’s only 12.'

Bronwyn added: 'I’d like to think that my powerlifting will encourage other women to lift weights.'

Bronwyn, who studies hairdressing one
day a week at Inverness College, now has her sights set on the Bench 
Press Championships in Northampton on February 11.
