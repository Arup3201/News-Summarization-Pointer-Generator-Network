Ferrero, the company which makes Nutella, is the world's biggest buyer of hazelnut and may be forced to increase product prices due to the nut shortage

The price of Nutella could be on the rise due to a global shortage of hazelnuts caused by a washout of crops following bad weather.

The cost of hazelnuts has increased by more than 60 per cent already this year after hail storms and frost obliterated crops in Turkey, where about 70 per cent of the world’s hazelnuts are harvested.

It has resulted in a stark increase in the wholesale price of the nut, which has risen to £6,300 ($10,500) per tonne from just £3,900 ($6,500) per tonne in February.

While the extent of the damage to the hazelnut flowers on Turkey’s Black Sea coast is not yet fully evident, it is feared about 300,000 tonnes of the crop could have been damaged in March’s poor weather.

It comes after continued warnings about the rising cost of cocoa which has continued to soar as demand outstrips production.

Experts have warned that a growing taste for chocolate in Asia – particularly in China – means cocoa farmers will need more help to provide a greater amount to export or manufacturers will be forced to use less cocoa in their products.

It is feared the rising demand could become unsustainable by 2020, unless more is done to help cocoa growing communities.

The threat of a global shortage of both cocoa and hazelnuts comes as bad news for chocolate makers – many of whom combine the ingredients for their products.

Michael Stevens, a trader at Edinburgh-based Freeworld Trading, said the rising price of the nut was a worry for market leaders.

He told The Guardian: ‘Buyers are living hand to mouth. Some people had contracts already [pre-dating the frost] and they are not going to get them.

‘A lot of people are still uncovered in the market and people that thought they were covered are now in the market again.’

It is especially a worry for Nutella, which claims to contain more than 50 hazelnuts per every 400g jar. 

Nutella currently costs between £1.75 and £2.25 in major UK supermarkets but may well face an increase if the price of hazelnuts continues to rise.

According to the Italian Trade Agency, Ferrero - the company which makes and owns Ferrero Rocher and Nutella – is the world’s biggest buyer of hazelnuts, using 25% of the world's supply.

Last month, Italian-based Ferrero confirmed it had bought Turkish company Oltan - one of the world leaders in the production and marketing of hazelnuts.

In a statement, the Piedmont-based Ferrero gave no financial details but said Oltan had five production plants exporting to the European Union and other important markets.

Cadbury, which also makes a range of nut-related chocolate bars including its Whole Nut bar, may also have to look into addressing prices of its products to reflect the rising ingredient costs.

However, American-based Mondelez – the company which owns Cadbury - declined to comment on whether it had plans to increase the price of its products.

MailOnline has contacted Ferrero for comment.
