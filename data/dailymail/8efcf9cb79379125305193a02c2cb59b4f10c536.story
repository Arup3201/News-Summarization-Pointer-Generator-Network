The mother of an off-duty police officer who was killed by a wrong-way illegal immigrant driver has written a furious letter to President Obama demanding to know why the man was not deported after being convicted of a crime.

Mary Ann Mendoza, who lost her son Sgt. Brandon Mendoza in the horror crash in Mesa, Arizona in May, expressed her anger that the driver, Raul Silva-Corona, was not sent back to Mexico two decades ago after he carried out crimes in Colorado.

'The prosecutors were "lenient" on him and several charges were dismissed,' she wrote in the letter.

'When
 he was convicted of these crimes (in) 1994 and the government knew he 
was in the country illegally, why wasn't he deported? Why are any of 
these illegal criminals in this country?

Pain: Mary Ann Mendoza, pictured in May after her son was killed by an illegal immigrant in a car crash, has written a letter to President Obama demanding to know why the man was still in the U.S.

'I am furious that the Federal Government allowed this criminal to stay in this country and KILL my son!'

Corona was a native of Chihuahua, Mexico, who had entered the United States without permission.

Court records show that he pleaded guilty to a criminal-conspiracy charge in Adams County in 1994 and prosecutors dismissed charges of burglary, assault and leaving an accident scene.

Speaking to The Arizona Republic, Mrs Mendoza said that she was not planning to stop at the letter.

With the help of a lawyer, she is calling for laws that would 
prohibit undocumented immigrants from purchasing and registering 
vehicles without a driver's license and further legislation that would remove 
undocumented immigrants who are convicted of a crime.

Killed: Brandon Mendoza, left, was killed when Raul Silva-Corona, right, drove the wrong way for 35 miles along freeways before smashing into his car. Corona also died in the crash

'I have to do something in my son's memory to stop this kind of thing from happening,' she said.

She added that she does not have any problems with law-abiding undocumented immigrants in the country.

The White House did not respond immediately to a request for comment.

Mendoza, 32, had been driving home from work on May 12 when Silva-Corona smashed into him after driving the wrong way along freeways for 35 miles.

Police received 33 911 calls as he sped along the Loop 101 Freeway, down State Route 51 and eventually to the I-10/US 60 interchange before hitting Mendoza on a freeway ramp.

Mendoza, a beloved 13-year veteran of the force, was taken to an area hospital in critical condition and later died.

Loss: Mendoza had worked for the police for 13 years and was driving home from work when he was hit

Fatal: Footage shows the massive fire that followed the head-on collision between the two cars on May 12

Scene: Corona died at the scene while Mendoza passed away shortly afterwards in hospital

Officer Carrick Cook, a state Department
 of Public Safety spokesman, said Mendoza likely only had seconds of 
warning before the crash.

Silva-Corona died at the scene and his body was so badly burned that authorities could not immediately identify him.

After he was identified, police said he had a blood-alcohol content of 0.24 per cent. In Arizona, a driver is presumed to be intoxicated at 0.08 per cent.

Police had
 frantically tried to stop him during a 30-minute chase. One officer had
 smash into the vehicle to stop it, but the driver drove around him and 
continued.

'We were scrambling,' Cook said. 'Nobody was really pursuing. We were just trying to intercept.'

KPHO reported that Mendoza was a bachelor who had family in the area as well as a brother deployed to South Korea.

President Obama,

I am writing this letter to you regarding illegal immigrants.

As a tax paying, law abiding citizen of the United States, I WANT my voice heard on this issue. My son, Sergeant Brandon Mendoza, an officer who was with the City of Mesa, Arizona police department, was killed in a tragic head on collision on May 12, 2014 by a wrong way driver on our freeways. This man happened to be an illegal immigrant, was in this country illegally, convicted of previous crimes, no Social Security number, no valid driver's license BUT he had purchased a vehicle and registered it to drive in Maricopa County Arizona.

The Federal Government knew he, Raul Silva Corona , was an illegal immigrant when he was convicted on crimes in 1994 in Colorado. The prosecutors were 'lenient' on him and several charges were dismissed... Why wasn't he deported?

I am furious that the Federal Government allowed this criminal to stay in this country and KILL my son!

[My son] was an Icon with the City of Mesa Police Department. He was instrumental in making life better for people of all walks of life in the park project he took on. He was humble, selfless, worked many hours off the clock helping disadvantaged children.

I want laws to change that would not allow illegal immigrants to purchase vehicles in our country and register them to drive them in our states WITHOUT having driver's licenses to drive them legally.

I want answers that make sense. I want answers from you personally as to why this criminal was allowed to stay in our country until he took my son's life.

Sincerely,

Mary Ann Mendoza
