A grieving mother whose son was brutally murdered by a gang as he played football has pledged to sell her family heirlooms to give his killers a better life when they leave jail.

Forgiving Fatemah Golmakani, 56, will 'hug them and kiss them and hold their hands, and tell them that someone loves them,' despite the four attackers stabbing her son Milad to death in north London last year in a tit-for-tat gang attack.

Sean Hutton, Sean Ferdinand, Mohammed Hashi, all 19, and Lij McSween, 17, were all jailed last month for life, and must all serve between 19 and 22 years before release.

Happier times: Fatemah Golmakani and her beloved son Milad, who was stabbed to death by a violent gang his mother has now pledged to help

But through a charity set up in her son's memory Mrs Golmakani says she will then take them 'to Europe, to eat good food, wear nice clothes, show them what life is really about.'

22-year-old Milad had been playing football last April with friends on an estate basketball court in West Hampstead, London, when his killers, all wearing black jackets with hoods pulled over their faces, arrived by minicab.

In the space of three minutes they knifed Milad 14 times in the neck, back and buttocks and stabbed another youth in the shoulder.

The gang then left in the same taxi they arrived in and returned to a church barbecue on their own territory in Kentish Town.

More than a year after her son’s murder, his room remains untouched.

'I can’t bring my son back but what I can do is forgive his murderers to begin to take the weight off myself. It’s the only way I can start coming to terms with it,' she said.

'What these men didn’t realise was that when they murdered my son, all their hopes and dreams were buried in Milad’s grave with him. All that went away when they killed my son, so really when we buried Milad we buried these murderers too.

'Those boys would have been at work, and then by the time they were back their minds and bodies would be too tired to kill. This charity will be a present to the killers. I want to help them look for jobs, and I want to make dinner for them like their own mothers should have done.

'Maybe then they’ll go back home and teach their own parents what they should have been taught years ago.' 

Her son was taken to hospital with a punctured lung but was pronounced dead hours after the attack.

His friend Zain Salahuddin was stabbed twice in the right shoulder when he tripped and fell trying to escape the gang.

He managed to get up and find safety in the basement of a nearby food and wine store.

Speaking during the court case, Prosecutor Neil Moore said: ‘Despite the warm weather they were all wearing jackets with their hoods up over their heads and they had at some stage concealed about their persons at least two knives.

‘The purpose of their trip was to seek out and attack Milad Golmakani and his friends.'
