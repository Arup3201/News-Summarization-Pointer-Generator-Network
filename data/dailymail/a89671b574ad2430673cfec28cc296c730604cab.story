Slovenia earned a shock win over Switzerland in their European Championships qualifier to leave Vladimir Petkovic's side joint bottom of  Group E with San Marino.

The game appeared to be heading for a draw before Johan Djourou gave away a penalty with just 10 minutes remaining.

Milivoje Novakovic duly converted from the spot to provide Slovenia with an invaluable three points ahead of their clash with Lithuania.

Lithuania continued their winning start to the group by beating Estonia 1-0 in Vilnius.

After making heavy work of San Marino last month, Igoris Pankratjevas may have worried about how his team would hold up against sterner opposition.

But any fears were eased when Saulius Mikoliunas popped up with 15 minutes remaining to score the only goal of the game and keep his side second in the group.

The visitors finished the game with 10 men after two second-half bookings for Ken Kallaste saw him take an early bath. 

Lithuania will host Slovenia in their next game while Estonia welcome England.
