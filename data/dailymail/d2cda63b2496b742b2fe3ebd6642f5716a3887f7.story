Ryan Giggs has paid tribute to Louis van Gaal’s ‘fantastic pedigree’ but refused to say if he will serve under the Dutchman as a player or coach at Manchester United next season.

Giggs is understood to be disappointed that he has not been given more of an opportunity to stake a claim for the job after being installed as United’s interim boss for the final four games of the season.

The club are considering offering the 40-year-old a new 12-month playing contract, but the decision over whether he will be retained on the coaching staff is down to Van Gaal.

Exit the dragon? Ryan Giggs will not commit to working at United as a player or coach next season

Fair play: Giggs (L) admits that the Dutchman has 'fantastic pedigree' to become next Man United manager

United’s plan to appoint the Holland coach next week is highly unlikely to change despite indications from Bayern Munich coach Pep Guardiola yesterday that all is not well in Germany.

Van Gaal will bring his own backroom team to Old Trafford, casting uncertainty over the futures of Giggs’s assistants Paul Scholes, Phil Neville and Chris Woods, while Nicky Butt is set to be offered his old role with the Under-18s.

Giggs, meanwhile, is known to be unsure if he wants to be part of the new regime. He grew frustrated with his lack of input under David Moyes after being named player-coach last summer, and knows that he is likely to have even less say with Van Gaal at the helm.

What became of the likely lads? The futures of United's 'Class of 92' on the coaching staff are uncertain

Publicly, he praised United’s prospective new boss yesterday. Privately, there are reservations as talks with United chief Ed Woodward continue. Pressed on his future at Old Trafford, Giggs refused to look beyond the end of the season.

‘He (Van Gaal) has got a brilliant reputation and is a successful manager in different countries,’ he said. ‘He’s taken Holland to the World Cup. Yes, he’s got fantastic pedigree.

‘I’m constantly speaking to Ed. Developments change all the time. At the moment he’s just letting me getting on with preparing the team and doing the best I can on the training pitch and preparing the team for winning the next three games.

‘Nothing’s changed. It’s just until the end of the season. We’ll chat when that’s over and that’s all.

‘There is no point in thinking if I want to be an assistant or a manager somewhere else. There’s so many things to think about. My concentration isn’t on next season it’s on this season.’

It raises the prospect of Giggs, the most decorated player in English football since making his United debut 23 years ago, leaving the club after next weekend’ s final game against Southampton. Indeed, he might already have played his last game at Old Trafford after a record 962 appearances for the club.

‘It’s not something I’ve thought about,’ he added. ‘We’ll just have to wait and see. My main priority is winning the games. Is me playing giving us the best chance?

‘I’ve got a lot to think about, whether to carry on playing. I’m still training and doing bits and pieces so I’m still in the frame of maybe being involved in the remaining games.’

Old guard: Giggs hopes that veterans Rio Ferdinand (R) and Patrice Evra stay on at Old Trafford

Despite uncertainty over his own future, Giggs backed fellow veterans Rio Ferdinand and Patrice Evra to extend their playing careers at United if given the chance.

‘I’d like them to stay on,’ he said. ‘It’s their decision, their contracts are both up. They have both given massive service to the club and they are both fit, and looked good last week. I don’t see why not.

‘It’s everyone’s decision – Rio, Pat, Ed and whoever is the manager next year – but I still think they have a lot to offer. They’ve been great players and remain assets to a club like Manchester United.’
