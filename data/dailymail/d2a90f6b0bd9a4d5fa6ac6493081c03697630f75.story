An apartment block is being planned on the Upper West Side of Manhattan which will separate the rich tenants from the poor.

Developer Extell has applied for tax breaks amid construction of a massive complex stretching ten blocks as it will include 55 low-income homes.

However, these will reportedly be separated from the rest of the luxury river-view condos with a different entrance at the rear of 40 Riverside Boulevard.

'Well, there could soon be a version right here on the Upper West Side!' wrote blogger West Side Rag.

New York City offers an Inclusionary Housing Program which lets developers access tax breaks and other bonuses by creating or preserving low-income homes.

40 Riverside Boulevard is set to be a 33-story tower comprising of 530 units.

The New York Post reported that the low-income units - on only the second to sixth floors - will cost $845 for a studio, $908 for a one-bed and two-beds for $1,099.

In comparison, luxury, seven-bedroom homes over three levels in the neighboring 60 Riverside Boulevard sell for $15.9million.

In a statement to MailOnline, the Extell Development Company said: 'Many factors go into the design of a building including efficiency, cost and financibility, especially when the units are permanently affordable, which is the case here.

'The goal we will deliver on is filling a neighborhood need by adding high quality affordable residences in a beautiful neighborhood - residences we are confident will attract no shortage of applicants.'
