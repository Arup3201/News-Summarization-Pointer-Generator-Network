Congressman Charles Rangel is hoping a new biographical rap song will give him an edge in Harlem as he faces a tough primary fight.

A YouTube page run by his campaign uploaded a video this weekend featuring unidentified rappers detailing 84-year-old Representative Rangel's biography and urging listeners to vote for the 'superfly, stand-up guy' in the Democratic primary on Tuesday. The beat-heavy track thumps as a campaign poster displays on screen.

The catchy chorus of 'Charlie, Charlie, Charlie Rangel' follows such informative lines as 'He was born in Harlem; got a purple heart and bronze star, earned 'em in the Army' and 'at 16 he worked a lot of low paying jobs so he knows what it means to be poor.'

How much it help his chances is unclear. The video, posted by 'rangel4congress', has garnered only 301 hits so far, many of whom are likely bored political reporters. The Week calls the song 'Incredibly, not bad.'

The race appeared to be widening in the Congressman's favor as New Yorkers prepared to cast their ballots.

An NY1/Siena College poll of likely primary voters gave Representative Rangel a comfortable 13 point lead  over his main challenger New York state Senator Adriano Espaillat, 47 per cent to 34 per cent.

Race has become a major issue in the contest. Representative Rangel is one of the most recognizable members of the Congressional Black Caucus, while Senator Espaillat is hoping his roots help him in the increasingly Hispanic district.

If he wins, he would become the first Dominican-born member of Congress.

Representative Rangel raised eyebrows when he asked in one debate, 'Just what the heck 
has he done besides saying he's a Dominican?'

The Congressman on Saturday said he's not overconfident he'll 
prevail over Senator Espaillat but insisted that voters would stick 
with a veteran lawmaker, dismissing criticism that he was too old to 
continue serving in Washington, according to the AP.

'If
 you had a racehorse that won 43 races, brings in the money, but the 
horse is old and experienced and knows the track — what would you do?' Representative Rangel asked reporters at a Washington Heights storefront 
church, where he was endorsed by about a dozen Spanish-speaking 
ministers. 'Would you send him to the glue factory? Hell no.'
