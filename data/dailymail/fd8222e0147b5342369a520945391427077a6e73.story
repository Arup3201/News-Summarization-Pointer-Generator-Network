It was a whirlwind romance, culminating in a sumptuous summer wedding in August last year, but last night Jodie Kidd confirmed that she and her husband David Blakeley were not to be.

The former model and polo player revealed the pair had split after just forth months of marriage telling The Sun: 'It is with sadness that David and I have separated. My priority remains my son Indio.'

The couple had been together for nearly 18 months and had spoken of their hope that they would spend the rest of their lives together. It is thought that they separated just before Christmas.

In happier times: Jodie and David attended an event together in October shortly after their marriage - last night the model confirmed that they have split after just four months 

Covering up: Posing with Quentin Wilson there were times when Jodie seemed to make an effort to cover her un-ringed finger 

No ring: Jodie was spotted at The Classic Car Show launch today in an all black outfit having removed her wedding and engagement rings.

For mother-of-one Jodie, 35, who was previously married to internet entrepreneur Aidan Butler, it's not her first divorce. 

Her marriage to Butler lasted just 18 months and she was reportedly blindsided when he decided to split in 2007 - she'd similarly said that she thought she and Aidan would be together forever.

Indeed the similarities between the two situations are undoubtedly glaring. When Jodie married Aidan, she described him as, 'the man I am going to spend the rest of my life with.'

Then when she tied the knot with author David, 34, Jodie told Hello! magazine: 'As soon as David and I met, I went through a huge 360 in my mind. I thought, "That's it, we're going to spend the rest of our lives together."

'Everything has changed in my life. He's given me the confidence to go and conquer the world.'

Speaking about Jodie, David said: 'I'm the luckiest guy in the world. With my parents being childhood sweethearts, I wanted to get married. But I did wonder is I was going to ever meet someone I wanted to spend the rest of my life with.'

After her split from Aidan, Jodie admitted that perhaps they hadn't known each other as well as they should have.

She said in an interview with FEMAIL in 2008: 'It was the wedding year, then I went, "Whoa! I don't really know you and I don't think you know me either." We were complete opposites. And then we got divorced - it was a terrible, awful, awful period.'

In today's reports The Sun claimed that the reason Jodie and David decided to go their separate ways was because they had rushed things and hadn't got to know each other well enough either.

History repeating itself: Jodie split from her first husband Aidan in 2007, she has previously revealed that she didn't think the couple knew each other well enough to have married 

Jodie got engaged to David in January 2014, after a two-month romance, after splitting from the father of her two-year-old son, Andrea Vianini. 

They then married at the Holy Trinity church in Plaistow, West Sussex, after just 10 months together. 

She wore a floor-length Grecian style Zaeem Jamal gown whilst David opted for a smart grey suit. 

Following a church service - where Indio played pageboy - the couple celebrated their nuptials with close friends and family at the 16th century home they lived in.

So why is Jodie so quick to fall in love and rush down the aisle? One reason could be that  she is trying to recreate the family unit she lost when her parents Wendy and John divorced in 2007.

Splitting in the same year as she and Aidan did, Jodie has previously spoken about how damaged she felt after their break up.

Liz Cowell, divorce lawyer at Slater & Gordon said: 'Generally when a marriage only lasts four months the court will try and put the parties back to where they were pre marriage when dividing their assets. Unless of course there is a pre nuptial agreement.

'People often think that after such a short marriage they can get the relationship annulled but in England they will have to wait a year before divorce proceedings can be started. 

'And unless the marriage is unconsummated there are unlikely to be grounds for annulment. 

'It can often take couples married for this short a period more time to officially separate than those who have been together longer who can get a quickie divorce in a matter of months, because they have to wait until they have been married a year before they can start proceedings.' 

Jodie is the great-granddaughter of Press baron Lord Beaverbrook, and one of three children born to show jumper Johnny and his wife, Wendy, herself the daughter of baronet Sir John Hodge.

She revealed she was with her brother Jack, 42, and sister Jemma, 40, at the family home in Barbados for Easter  when their father dropped the bombshell that he had fallen in love with an American stuntwoman almost 30 years his junior.

'Everything imploded. I didn't really know what was happening. When my parents separated, the perfect picture of our family was completely shattered,' Jodie said at the time.

'It was incredibly tough for us, and it affected us all much more than we thought it ever could.'

Indeed, it was perhaps the end of her parents marriage - and the failure of her relationship with Aidan -that led her to make the wrong decisions in her future relationships.  

'I was shocked, completely and utterly shocked,' she said of the experience of watching her parents split, 'Everything we knew was a lie. 

'Suddenly, we were in a different dimension. My parents had always been together, and I was proud of that. As the youngest child, I suppose I never really knew what was going on. 

'There had been issues for a while, which I didn't know about. It's only now that I'm really starting to speak to Mum and Dad about it.'

And Jodie has faced her own personal battles. She was spotted at just 15 and had an incredibly successful modelling career, starting work at just 16. 

However in 2008 she lost several modelling contracts after she was accused of allegedly purchasing cocaine and boasting about taking the drug. 

She has also filled out over the years after being referred to as a 'a sick anorexic giraffe' who criticised her 'heroin chic,' looks. 

Despite having worked on several lucrative contracts over the years for brands like Lagerfeld and Monsoon, Jodie had always been lampooned for what people referred to as her 'skeletal' size.  

Jodie is currently preparing to take part in the Channel 4 show The Jump which starts on Sunday. 

She is up against fellow celebrities such as Chloe Madeley, Stacey Solomon, Ashley Roberts and Heather Mills. 

She has previously referred to herself as an, 'adrenaline junkie,'  and has an attitude which is perhaps belying of how she likes to live her life. 

She once said: 'I love fast action. 'I'm terrible at thinking things over. I go, "Right, let's move on to the next thing." Always move forwards.

'Never regret. I have to keeping moving forwards, otherwise I think I'll get swallowed up.' 

A spokesman for Joddie Kidd declined to comment to FEMAIL.
