Everybody likes a friendly welcome on their first day in a new job, but this greeting may have crossed the line.

Brian Barczyk was the subject of some unwanted attention as he tried to tried to clean out the pen of four-year-old llama-alpaca hybrid Misty.

Barczyk was chased by the apparently bad-tempered animal, before being mounted several times - and it was all caught on camera.

Zoo volunteer Brian Barcyzk was given what appeared to be a very friendly welcome by llama Misty on his first day at work

But the four-year-old llama's attentions were a little too much for Barcyzk

Misty also chased Barczyk around her pen - which he had been hoping to help clean

Eventually, the television producer was forced to jump the fence to escape

Barczyk, who works as a producer for Animal Bytes TV, was volunteering for the first time at the Tri-State Zoological Park in Maryland.

On a video of the incident, he can be heard telling a zookeeper cleaning out the pen of the petting zoo animal seems 'like a pretty easy job'.

Little did he know what was about to happen. 

The video shows Misty chasing and trying to mount the volunteer as he tries to sweep up.

Eventually, it all gets a bit too much for Barcyzk, who is forced to leap over a fence in a desperate bid to escape her attentions.

The attack came as a shock to Barcyzk, who said he'd been expecting a warmer welcome from the furry animal - especially considering he is more used to working with snakes.

After all, llamas aren't known for their aggressive tendencies.

'Misty looked so cute, I was excited to get in her enclosure and clean up,' Barcyzk said.

Barcyzk said afterwards he had been expecting a warmer welcome as she looked 'so cute' 

He had also thought that llamas were tame - a myth Misty helped dispel

'I had no idea she was so upset as I had always heard that llamas were tame.

'But she certainly dispelled that myth and chased me out of the pen.'

Tri-State Zoological Park is a non-profit facility that houses mainly exotic animals that are in need of a home.

These include lions, tigers, birds, reptiles and primates.

Whether or not Barcyzk has returned to the pen since is not known
