A crack-addicted childminder has been jailed for 13 years for killing a child she meant to be taking care of and hiding his body in a freezer.

Carolyn Renee Miller, 42, who was paid in drugs to look after seven-month-old Ja’veon Mitchell in 2011, may have been high on crack when he died, a court heard.

Miller pleaded no contest to 
aggravated manslaughter of a child and improper disposal of a human 
body, during a hearing in August.

Today she was starting a 13 year sentence behind bars which included six years of drug offender probation.

Miller claims she woke up one day to find the baby had died. She told the court she panicked and hid the baby’s body in a freezer behind her boyfriend’s house in Titusville, Florda.

Paying tribute to little Ja’veon, who would have been three year old today, Assistant State Attorney Julia Lynch told FloridaToday.com: ‘He would have been talking, running, playing. They’re so engaging at three years of age, there’s so much they can do.’

‘He looked like a normal, healthy little baby. Like all kids that age – 7 months – they’re completely dependent. They just want somebody to hold them, take care of them.’

It is still not known what exactly caused Ja’veon’s death, with it officially recorded as unknown.

But Brevard County Medical Examiner Sajid Qaiser told the court he was ‘leaning more towards a homicide or neglect’ as a cause of the child’s death.

Lynch said the defense argued Miller was suffering from PTSD and trauma from a tough upbringing and bad relationships.

She said a therapist testified in court that Miller was dazed and confused at the time - displaying symptoms of being on drugs at the time of the child’s death.

Lynch said the judge noted that Miller was being paid in crack cocaine to take care of the child.

It is understood the child’s mother will no face prosecution.
