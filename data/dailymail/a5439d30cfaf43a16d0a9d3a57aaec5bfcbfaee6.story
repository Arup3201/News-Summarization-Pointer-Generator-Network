Dame Vivienne Westwood has published her remarkable life story for the first time in a brand new autobiography.

A national treasure, the fashion designer and activist, 73, stands for punk, eclectic Britannia and modern Victorian style, and more recently a host of philanthropic issues.

Together with her friend Ian Kelly, a notable biographer and historian, the mother-of-two and grandmother-of-one tells her tale for the first time in all its glamour and glory; with her unique voice, unexpected perspective and passionate honesty.

'The living deserve respect. The dead deserve the truth,' she says.

'Ian and I are working together on this and I am excited that this will be my story, the story nobody ever did before.'

The fearless female icon has both written and collaborated on her memoir and authorised biography.

It comprises partly her own voice, and partly contributions from her vast network of friends, family and associates.

Ian Kelly brings the insights of a historian and friend of Vivienne - a true living legend and national treasure - to the life and works of one of the major influences of our age in this wonderful, insightful collaboration.

He describes Vivienne, his friend, subject and muse: 'Vivienne is much more than what you first see.

'She is passionately committed to human rights and to eco-politics, but as well as that I am keen to tell the truth about a huge-hearted, warm and witty individual, whose face and clothes are known the world over, but who is also recognisably the Derbyshire primary school teacher who met and fell in love with Malcolm McLaren and changed the world.'

Her eclectic group of friends, activists and confrères range from Pamela Anderson to Prince Charles, Shami Chakrabati, Naomi Campbell, Jerry Hall, Bob Geldof and Julian Assange. 

Many of them - along with her close family and her design partner and husband, Andreas Kronthaler, who  is 25 years her junior - contribute unique letters and stories to the book.

It tracks her colourful life, from humble beginnings and trendsetting twenties through to the activism of her seventies.

Dame Westwood was born Vivienne Swire in rural Derbyshire in 1941.

She came to London in her late teens and by the time she was 21 she'd already married, divorced and was bringing up her first son, Ben. It was then that she met Malcolm McLaren. 

Together they created the global phenomenon of punk - managing the Sex Pistols, and running a clothing emporium at the end of the King's Road. They also had a son together, Joe, who went on to found Agent Provacateur.

So began a journey of self-discovery and intellectual ambition that found her basing entire collections on eighteenth-century paintings, and teaching herself to be perhaps the best cutter working in fashion. 

She has had, as a result, a profound impact on fashion and tailoring, responsible for instance for a re-invigoration of the entire British tweed industry. 

Her zest for life and for ideas has moved her more and more into political activism, and she is now on the board of Liberty, the human rights organisation, and is a Greenpeace spokesperson. 

She donates nearly all her money to saving the rainforests and the Arctic circle, living simply with husband Andreas, whom she met when she was teaching fashion. 

She has no intention, at 72, of retiring or shrinking from her activist role.

'The thing you need to know about Vivienne is that she is utterly genuine, utterly committed. 

'She is like the village elder you know has wise things to say, but who is also questioning, striving, and hungry to understand more,' says human rights campaigner Shami Chakrabati.

'She is an icon, and the most important practical feminist I can think of. She got on with it. She founded an empire. She is full of love for those around her - generous to a fault. And meanwhile, she looks fantastic!'
