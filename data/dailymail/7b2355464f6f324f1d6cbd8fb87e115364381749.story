A retired teacher was arrested today as part of a major inquiry into historic claims of a child sex ring at a school for vulnerable children.

Ron Parker, 70, was held at the climax of a two year investigation examining allegations of abuse spanning four decades.

The children’s author worked at Swaylands School, in Penshurst, Kent, an institution for ‘awkward boys’ which was shut down in the early 1990s.

Held: A 70-year-old man has been arrested by police investigating historic child sex abuse at the now closed Swaylands School in Kent, involving 20 children with special needs

The school, in a sprawling listed 
building, was closed amid allegations some of its pupils aged between 
seven and 19 were treated cruelly.

Now it can be revealed that a team of 
up to 40 officers has allegedly uncovered evidence of widespread abuse 
involving more than 20 victims.

They have been contacting former 
pupils who attended the school between 1967 and 1993, including 
potential victims in Ireland and Australia.

Three men, a 72 year-old-man in 
Norfolk, a 69 year-old-man in Edinburgh and a 60 year-old man from 
Berkshire have all been arrested and remain on bail.

An additional three suspects identified by detectives were found to have died before the investigation was launched.

Mr Parker was held by Greater Manchester Police during a dawn raid at his terraced home in Leigh, Lancashire.

Arrest: Officers from Kent Police are investigating the case

He was interviewed by officers who travelled to the North West to question him on suspicion of ‘historic child sex offences’.

The primary school governor and scout 
master has published a series of books, including The Blue Bike Murder 
which features disturbing scenes of child abuse.

On one website he wrote: ‘I am a 
writer, mostly of adult mysteries but I have also written some short 
stories and a sci-fi book for youngsters.

‘I live in the North West of England 
and I am involved with the Scouts and I am secretary of my local 
residents association. I’m also a school governor ‘Despite this busy 
life, I still find time to write and to look after my cat, Suzy.’

On a social networking site he claimed
to have worked as a ‘deputy superintendent’ at a children’s home 
between August 1979 and December 1997.

Swaylands School was set up in 1942 
and was operated and managed by the London borough of Barnet between the
mid 1960’s and 1994.

Pupils with learning, emotional and 
behavioural difficulties were placed there by local authorities from 
across the capital and the South East.

The landmark 19th century Tudor-style building was sold off several years ago for £2.65m and redeveloped into luxury housing.

The police inquiry follows an 
investigation in 1993 which resulted in the conviction of two men for 
sexual offences involving four children. Both were sentenced to three 
years.

Det Chief Insp Paul Fotheringham, of 
Kent and Essex Police’s Serious Crime Directorate, said the inquiry 
followed ‘new information’ from a victim.

He said: ‘This is a complex inquiry, where we have traced many people and records spanning a number of years.

‘Kent and Essex Police take 
allegations of previously unreported offending seriously and every 
effort is made to investigate whenever appropriate and possible.

‘We have also been working with a 
number of charities to ensure that appropriate support is in place for 
the victims that we have been speaking with.’

Peter Saunders, of the National 
Association for People Abused in Childhood (Napac), urged anyone 
struggling to cope with childhood abuse to get in touch.

He said: ‘Coming forward and speaking with the police about the crime of childhood abuse is never easy.

‘It is a particularly nasty crime that
often leaves the victim feeling vulnerable and anxious. These feelings 
usually persist long into adulthood.’

Anyone with information about the case
can contact officers on 01622 654852 or victims looking for support can
call Napac on 0800 085 3330.
