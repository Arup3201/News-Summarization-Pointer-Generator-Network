Former England cricketer Graeme Swann talks to Sportsmail about everything from his sporting heroes and career highlight to who would play him in a movie about his life.

Who is your sporting hero?

Peter Beardsley. I’m a Newcastle fan and he was always my favourite player — and he loves cricket. The first time I met him was at Durham. He was throwing his ball to his little lad but I went and shamelessly got his autograph.

What would you be if you weren’t a sportsman?

Probably a fighter pilot, astronaut or a rock star. You’ve got to aim high.

Career highlight?

The first time I won the Ashes, at the Oval in 2009. The next two were brilliant and everyone says the victory in Australia was better but for me the first time was amazing. Walking around the ground with Land of Hope and Glory and Jerusalem playing out, a 150ft St George’s Cross... I get goosebumps thinking about it.

...and the worst moment?

We lost 3-0 to Pakistan in the United Arab Emirates, that was pretty low. Obviously the Ashes last year was not great.

If your house was burning down, what one possession would you save?

As long as the family is safe I’d get my cats — Max and Paddy. They’re brother and sister (Maxine is the sister…).

What’s the best advice you’ve ever been given?

Don’t listen to what anyone else thinks about you. I can’t remember who told me that. I probably wasn’t listening.

Three most-listened to songs on your ipod?

Some Might Say by Oasis, Nirvana’s Smells Like Teen Spirit and Let it Go from the Frozen soundtrack. It gets played in my car constantly for the kids.

Last film you saw?

Ghostbusters. They did a 30th anniversary re-release. I bought a ticket for my wife but she looked at me like I was an idiot, so I took my mates.

Last book you read?

I really like books about World War Two but I’m a big Tom Clancy fan so probably one of his. Without Remorse is his best.

Which three people would you invite for dinner? 

George Lucas so I could ask him what he was doing with those three Star Wars prequels. Julius Caesar to see if he realised he would be seen as one of the greatest people to walk the planet. And Carmen Electra. I’ve fancied her since I was 15.

Favourite pre-match meal?

I was very superstitious so if we had a good day in a Test I’d have the same meal I had the night before. In India, Jimmy Anderson, Alastair Cook and I had the same order — two ham and pineapple pizzas, a buttered chicken, three portions of fries, two sticky toffee puddings and a chocolate cake. We were fat as houses but we won the Test.

In a film of your life, who would you like to play you?

Hugh Grant. He’s a good-looking guy. I reckon he’d be handy at cricket too.

Tell us a secret...

I’m not sure if it’s much of a secret but I’m the singer in a band — Dr Comfort and the Lurid Revelations. We’re not bad!
