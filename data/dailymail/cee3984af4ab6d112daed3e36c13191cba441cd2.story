A woman whose husband weighs almost 700lbs has shared her painfully honest account of being married to a person so obese.

Nissa, from Beaumont, Texas, says her marriage to Chuck, 46, has manifested into something more akin to a carer-patient relationship.

Speaking on tonight's episode of TLC's My 600lb Life, which focuses on her husband's plight, the mother-of-one admits that she 'just feels like a servant.'

Unhappily married: Nissa, from Beaumont, Texas, says her relationship with Chuck, 46, has manifested into something more akin to that of a carer-patient

She told the show: 'Marriage is extremely difficult when you're married to someone who is 600lbs. We don't have an intimate relationship - our marriage is much more caregiver-patient.'

Nissa says that taking care of their toddler son Nathan single-handedly also puts a big strain on her.

'Being a single mom is one thing,' she explains. 'But being a single mom when there's another human being there is much harder.'

For his part, Chuck feels immensely guilty that he cannot be the husband that he feels his wife deserves.Â

Taking its toll: Nissa breaks down as she admits to producers that she 'just feels like a servant'

The tow truck driver, who has always 
been heavy, saw his weight spiral out of control in 2006 following the 
murder of his first wife, and the later passing of his mother and 
stepfather.

He is now 
so obese, he cannot move without getting out of breath, limiting him 
from performing basic functions - though he does still work.

'When I met Chuck he was around 
600lbs,' Nissa recalls. 'He was very shy and didn't want to get out of the truck and 
introduce himself properly because of his size.

Connection: When they first met, Nissa says Chuck was around 600lbs. She decided to give him a chance and not judge him by his weight because she felt that is what other people did with her

'I felt that I should give
 him a chance because all of my relationships, I felt, had 
failed because of my weight, and I didn't want to judge him for his 
weight.'

Having now 
remarried and adopted a son with Nissa, Chuck knows he needs to change 
his life if he wants to keep his family intact.

'The
 main thing that really upsets me is putting a lot of strain on my 
wife,' he says. 'I can't do my part of everything that I'm supposed to 
do. And I want to provide for Nissa. Give her the life she deserves.'

Nor can Chuck be the father he would like to be.

'I've always wanted a son and we had the opportunity to adopt Nathan, and he's the best thing in the world. . . I'd like to go outside with Nathan and play, but I can hardly walk without getting winded,' he says.

Chuck also has a 40lb lymphedema on his leg - fluid retention and tissue swelling that puts him at high risk of infection. His doctor says that he could lose his leg if he does not start losing weight soon.

The next installment of My 600-lb Life airs on TLC tonight at 9/8c.
