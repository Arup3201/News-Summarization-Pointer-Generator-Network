John Force hoists the Funny Car World Championship Trophy after beating his daughter Courtney

A drag racer has won a record 16th title but had to compete against his teammate who happens to be his youngest daughter to take the trophy.Â 

John Force, 65, won three straight events and four overall this season to push his record career total to 138 beating his daughter Courtney Force in the final round in the NHRA Toyota Nationals.

Mr Force said: 'I read an article this morning about being humble, but right now I'd like to scream and shout.

'If there is anything I've ever done right in my life, it's been a team effort.'

He won the final with a 4.062-second run at 310.63 mph.

'We've
won the championship and we're glad to have done so, man we're having 
fun. I don't want to end my career at 16. I want to end it at 17 at 
least.'

Force competed against Gary Densham, Del Worsham and Alexis DeJoria to reach the final round.

'I'd
like to scream and say, "Gee, it was me", but the truth is (crew chief)
Jimmy Prock and the team he's got around him is unbelievable,' Force 
said.

'It's a team effort and that's what I'm really proud of, holding together when it looked like we were falling apart.'

Matt Smith also won at The Strip at Las Vegas Motor Speedway to wrap up his second Pro Stock Motorcycle season title.

Antron Brown won the Top Fuel event, and Shane Gray topped the Pro Stock field.

Smith said: 'This team has been awesome and winning this championship, it's great'. 'I don't want to sound too confident, but we've almost been unstoppable lately.'

Drag racing, also known in the industry as Funny Cars, has been dominated by Force.

His daughter Courtney dreamed of racing her father by drawing pictures of herself in a car alongside him.

The vehicles allow drivers to hit 300mph within seconds of flooring the accelerator.

A passion for racing clearly runs in the family as Courtney's elder sister Ashley was the first to demonstrate that female racers could compete successfully with men when she became the first woman to win a Funny Car event in 2008.

She exceeded 300mph, beating her father in the final quarter-mile event.
