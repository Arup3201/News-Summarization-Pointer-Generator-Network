Some of England’s best-loved beaches could be turned into no-go zones for swimmers under tough new EU rules.

Tourism bosses predict a disaster for local businesses if popular resorts are placed on an environmental blacklist over water quality.

When the new European directive is enforced in May 2015, the rules on water safety will become twice as stringent overnight, rendering dozens of beaches which are currently safe off-limits for swimmers.

Warning: Tourism bosses warn the new rules could be disastrous for local businesses across Britain's coast

One in ten of England’s 400 registered bathing beaches will fail the new tests, according to Environment Agency projections.

Signposts will be erected at sites that do not meet the tough new standards, warning swimmers against entering the water.

Ironically, 39 of those English beaches that could be on the EU blacklist were declared safe by the Marine Conservation Society today.

Even more remarkably, seven beaches which could fail next year are deemed to have ‘excellent’ water under the existing rules and are today included in the charity’s Good Beach Guide 2014.

Coastal residents and tourist industry representatives accept higher standards on water quality are needed – but say to suddenly double the strictness of the tests is ‘unfair’.

Water quality is highly dependent on weather, with a wet year causing more pollution to run into the sea.

So taking one test and then planting a sign on the beach telling people it is unsafe for swimming is not representative, residents fear.

Malcolm Bell, of Visit Cornwall, said: ‘These changes make it look as though things have got worse.’

Porthluney Cove and Seaton,  two popular Cornish beaches, are among seven that are considered ‘excellent’ – the highest grade – in today’s guide but are projected to fail next year.

Mr Bell said: ‘If you have a tourism business near one of those beaches it becomes a major issue. The tourists move on, but it is not so easy to move your business. Water quality is not static – it depends on the conditions, the weather and events out of your control. A better system would be to have live information on water quality and conditions.’

All three beaches at Blackpool  in Lancashire – each of them deemed safe according to today’s Marine Conservation Society report –  face having warning signs erected next year, despite huge investment in cleaning up sea water at  the resort.

Iain Hawkins, who runs eight tourist attractions in the town including Blackpool Tower, said: ‘Of course it is not fair. These changes should be brought in over a period.

‘The biggest attraction in Blackpool is the beach. If we were to lose that it would be a disaster.’

Other beaches that could fail include Mothecombe in South Devon, Seaton Carew North in County Durham and Spittal in Northumberland, which are currently all ‘excellent’.

The Marine Conservation Society’s report only found six English beaches that would fail on the current tests. Under the new rules 45 would fail.

Rachel Wyatt, coastal pollution officer at the society, said: ‘It’s great that we are able to recommend more beaches than ever for excellent water quality and it shows just how good British beaches can be.

‘But the main challenge now is maintaining these standards, whatever the weather.’

An Environment Agency spokesman said: ‘There have been major improvements in the quality of bathing waters over the decades.

‘Around nine in ten English beaches already meet the higher standards that come into force next year, but we cannot afford to be complacent.’
