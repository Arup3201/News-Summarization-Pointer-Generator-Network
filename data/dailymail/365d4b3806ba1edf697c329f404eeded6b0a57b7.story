Gary McKinnon, pictured in 2009 with his mother Janis Sharp, has been battling extradition for a decade

Gary McKinnon's supporters meet at 10 Downing Street today to mark a'nightmare' decade since his arrest for computer hacking.

His family have been battling against extradition after the Asperger's sufferer hacked into NASA and Pentagon computers looking for evidence of aliens.

The Americans are demanding Gary be extradited despite medical experts warning he could kill himself if sent to the U.S.

His mother Janis Sharp said last night:'Ten years have gone by and still Gary lives in a nightmare world - unable to control the terror that consumes his every waking moment.

'This endless pressure on an Aspergic man with severe mental health issues is barbaric. And for what?

'A foolish act that has caused embarrassment to the US.

'Where has our sense of proportion gone?'

Mrs Sharp will be handing in poems at Downing Street received after Gary's supporters set up the Poetic Justice Campaign marking his ten years of'fear and torment.'

Mrs Sharp, who will be joined by long-time supporter Trudie Styler, Gary's MP David Burrowes, former Tory shadow Home Secretary David Davis and Lord Maginnis said: 'In March David Cameron is visiting President Obama to discuss our “ special relationship”. What an opportunity for our PM to finally announce an end to Gary's ordeal.

'This act alone would prove that the “special relationship” has true meaning and is one of mutual respect.'

Bob Geldof is just one of many of Gary McKinnon's high-profile supporters

Last month the High Court ruled that Gary's legal nightmare must be decided by the summer

Home Secretary Theresa May agreed to delay his extradition in 2010 and is examining psychiatric evidence before she makes her final decision.

Lord Justice Richards, sitting with Mr Justice Cranston, said this new medical report must be handed to the McKinnon legal team within 28 days.

Gary's lawyers will have a similar period to respond before Mrs May decides his fate.

The judges said they were fixing the hearing date for July 'to concentrate minds' and Edward Fitzgerald QC, appearing for Gary - whose 46th birthday is on Friday - said he hoped Mrs May would now block the extradition.

Scores of celebrities and politicians from all parties have voiced their support for Gary since the Daily Mail launched its An Affront to British Justice campaign to stop his extradition in 2009.

Rock stars Sir Bob Geldof, Pink Floyd's David Gilmour, Sting, singers Chrissie Hynde and Peter Gabriel and actress Julie Christie all voiced their support to keep Gary in this country.
