Gabon’s dangerous front three combined to put them in control of Group A, as Burkina Faso, finalists in 2013, were punished for being wasteful in front of goal.

Borussia Dortmund forward Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang put the hosts ahead in the first half, before Charlton winger Frederic Bulot provided for Malick Evouna to seal the result with a header 20 minutes from time.

It puts Gabon top of the group, after hosts Equatorial Guinea drew with Congo in the day’s earlier game.

Plenty of locals stayed behind in the Estadio de Bata for the second game, and they saw Burkina Faso start the brighter. In fact, the Stallions could easily have scored three or four in an open first half.

Burkina Faso: Sanou; Koffi, Yago, Kone (Nakoulma 77), Bambara; Djakaridja , Kabore,; Zongo (Bance), A. Traore, B. Traore; Pitroipa

Gabon: Ovono; Palun, Masavu-King, Ecuele Manga, Obiang; Ndong (Kaku 63 mins), Poko, Madinda (Mbingui 83); Bulot, Evouna (Boukamba 87), Aubameyang

Booked: Ndong 40, Bulot 53

Goals: Aubameyang 19, Evouna 72  

Bertrand Traore, the Vitesse winger on loan from Chelsea, was the beneficiary of a defensive mix-up, but his stinging volley was palmed away by Gabon stopper Didier Ovono.

Alain Traore was the next to be denied, a last-ditch block preventing him from getting a shot away when well-placed inside the penalty area.

The pace of Jonahan Pitroipa was a constant threat in behind, and in the 19th minute he escaped the Gabonese defence and skipped around Ovono, but, having been forced wide, was unable to find a team-mate.

Just seconds later, Burkino Faso’s wastefulness was punished. Levy Madinda slid a lovely ball down the right hand channel for Gabon’s Borussia Dortmund star Aubameyang, who gave Pitroipa a lesson in staying calm in front of goal.

Although Aubameyang’s first shot was saved, he took his time with the rebound, commiting the covering defenders before firing into the roof of the net for his sixth goal in his last four games for Gabon.

Pitroipa, the leading goalscorer in all Cup of Nations qualifying, continued to have chances, but just couldn’t show the same finishing touch as Aubameyang.

On the half-hour mark Jonathan Zongo got free down the left hand side and fed the ball across to his striker, unmarked on the edge of the box. But Pitroipa could only fire straight at the keeper.

Again, he was very nearly punished immediately. Moments later Ibrahim Ndong latched on to an over-hit cut-back and fired just wide with the keeper well beaten.

Burkina Faso continued to create chances, and yet another glorious one fell to Pitroipa, when Alain Traore’s scuffed shot fell to him five yards out. Again, however, the Al Jazira striker was denied by Ovono.

The second period started slowly, but both Bulot and Bertrand Traore had good chances, the former volleying straight at the keeper when well placed, and the latter seeing a cheeky attempt to squeeze the ball in at the near post kicked away, following a strong run from the left.

Aubameyang could have added a second in the 68th minute, but after being played in down the left hand channel by Evouna, the Gabon captain curled his shot just wide.

It didn’t matter though, because just four minutes later Charlton winger Bulot showed quick feet down on the right wing, beating his man and sending in an inviting cross for Evouna to head home.

Bulot forced Germain Sanou into a good save in stoppage time, as Gabon saw out the remainder in relative comfort.
