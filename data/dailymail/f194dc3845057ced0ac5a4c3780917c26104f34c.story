Tesco has apologised to a customer and given him a £5 voucher after he was wrongly accused of walking out with a trolley full of shopping without paying.

Chris McGarry was humiliated when a member of the Supermarket giant's staff accused him of shoplifting.

The 19-year-old had already paid for his shopping but he was challenged as he left the store.

Shameful: Chris McGarry was with his mother Margaret when Tesco staff at this store in Northumberland falsely accused him of stealing a whole trolley of food

Mr McGarry was with his mother Margaret Reynolds when the incident happened at the branch in Bedlington, Northumberland, last month.

He said: 'As we were leaving a member of staff came up to us and said we had not paid for what was in the trolley.

'I explained that we had and pointed to the checkout where I had paid.

'I had to do this three times but she did not take any notice of what I was saying.

'When she pulled us up we were still in the shop and we felt uncomfortable in case there were people we knew.

'We showed her the till receipt proving we had paid but she did not say sorry, or even say anything at all, and we left the supermarket.

'By this time the team leader had arrived and confirmed I had paid.'

Upsetting: The 19-year-old was confronted as he wheeled away his trolley having paid with cash

He complained to the store afterwards and was given a £5 gift voucher but said said the amount was an insult for the allegation that he was a thief.

His card had been rejected after an unexpected withdrawal from his card account when he tried to pay.

So he left the trolley behind and left the store for a few minutes while he went to a nearby bank and got some cash from a different account.

He said: 'The checkout assistant said it was all right to leave the trolley and come back later.

'So I got the cash and went back into the store.

'I wanted to go to the same checkout but she was busy so I went to the next one along. I paid at the second checkout and thought nothing of it at that point.

'It was after I paid that the first checkout assistant came to us and accused us of trying to take the trolley.'

Tesco said today the issues has been resolved.

A spokeswoman said: 'We are sorry that Mr McGarry felt that he was treated unfairly.

'We have since spoken to him and resolved the issue.'
