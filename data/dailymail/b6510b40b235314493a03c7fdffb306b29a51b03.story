The Garcia report into World Cup vote corruption - now in possession of the FIFA ethics chiefs - is understood to be far more damning of the bidding countries than expected.

It’s understood Michael Garcia details the huge amount of money involved in allegedly attempting to buy votes in those flawed 2018 and 2022 ballots - with the figures even bigger than those revealed in previous newspaper investigations. And the persistent rumours about the 2022 decision in particular are enough for bookmakers Coral to fancifully make Qatar odds-on to be stripped of the 2022 World Cup.

This will add yet more pressure on FIFA to make Garcia’s report public with German judge Hans-Joachim Eckert, head of the adjudicatory chamber of the ethics committee, only prepared to make an interim statement next month with no commitment from Zurich over whether the full 430-page document will ever see the light of day because of witness confidentiality issues.

Sepp Blatter's FIFA film only took £150,000 at the box office

UEFA president Michel Platini has led the complaints from inside the FIFA ExCo for at least the findings and recommendations be published. And Michael Hershman, founder of anti-corruption watchdog Transparency International, said at the Securing Sport conference on Monday that FIFA will continue to be ridiculed as long as it keeps Garcia’s findings under wraps.

Ironically, Securing Sport is a lavish Qatar-funded event at London’s Lancaster House where Tuesday’s speakers include German football great Franz Beckenbauer, who was banned from football for 90 days for refusing to co-operate with Garcia — which he eventually did.

Meanwhile, FIFA president Sepp Blatter’s vanity project - the FIFA history film United Passions - has taken only around £150,000 at the box office. Blatter ensured that FIFA spent £16million on it.

You need to say something special to create any impression during the current sports conference season when so much tosh is spoken. And David Howman, director general of the World Anti-Doping Agency did so at Securing Sport by claiming 25 per of world sport had been infiltrated by organised crime – albeit mainly below elite level. However, Howman wouldn’t say which sports or where.

West Yorkshire Police have what is described as a dedicated Twitter account for Leeds United fans -@LUFC_WYP - that gives information on travel, tickets and security ahead of games. So it’s somewhat surprising that the account is following the personal sites of Playboy Playmates such as Dani Mathers, Tiffany Toth and Ashley Hobbs, who can’t all be Leeds fans.

World heavyweight champion Wladimir Klistchko was forced to postpone his IBF world title with Kubrat Pulev this month after he tore bicep muscles in training. 

And the word is Britain’s great heavyweight hope, Olympic gold medallist Anthony Joshua, surprised Klistchko with his speed and strength while sparring in Austria before the fight was delayed.

City take United rejects

Manchester United United may be struggling to keep up with rivals City in the Premier League, but commercially United are in a different league. London sales staff laid off by United for performance reasons have been given jobs in the Manchester City office in the capital.

Meanwhile, it was noticeable that when welcoming Park Ji-sung into the group of United club ambassadors on the pitch before the game against Everton, Sir Alex Ferguson mentioned the ‘greats’ who do that role around the world such as Andy Cole and Bryan Robson, but didn’t include himself. Yet Fergie is United’s best paid ambassador, earning £2m for 20 days work a year.

The Ryder Cup is one of the great sporting events. But it cannot satisfy the European Tour or PGA of America that the peak viewing from Gleneagles for Sky Sports’ live coverage was 1.7m, compared to 3.1m for BBC highlights.

Kevin Pietersen’s book isn’t officially published until Thursday, but has already been overtaken by events. KP writes he still has a lot of cricket to play in the Indian Premier League, Big Bash, Caribbean Premier League and for Surrey. However Surrey, for one, have cancelled KP’s registration.
