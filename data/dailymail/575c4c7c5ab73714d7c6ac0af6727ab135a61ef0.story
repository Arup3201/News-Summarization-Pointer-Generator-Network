A Florida woman will not be charged with a crime after authorities say she attacked her boyfriend and threatened him with a knife.

The reason 31-year-old Shavonna Rumph gave police for the December altercation: her boyfriend, 33-year-old Henry Price Jr, refused to cuddle with her. 

Regardless of the reason, an assistant state attorney in Florida reported on Wednesday that a misdemeanor battery charge would not be filed against Rumph.

Cuddle bully: Shavonna Rumph will not be charged after pulling a knife on her boyfriend after he refused to cuddle with her

According to a report from the Manatee County Sheriff's office, on December 28, Rumph and Prince had been drinking at the home they share in Bradenton - according to the report, the couple had been drinking all day and through the night.

At some point, the couple got into an argument 'over Henry refusing to ‘cuddle’ with Shavonna when they went to bed,' the report states.

According to the report, the argument 'turned physical when Shavonna grabbed Henry by the shirt, causing it to tear.'

History: The police were called during another altercation between Rumph and her boyfriend after she 'slashed the tires on his car'

After ripping his shirt, Rumph - an employee at a local Kentucky Fried Chicken - 'picked up a kitchen knife as if she was going to use it to hurt or stab Henry,' according to the report.

Price told authorities that Rumph didn't want him to leave after the initial altercation, which is when she grabbed the knife.

The day after the incident, Rumph posted on her Facebook page a cartoon implying that it is better to smoke marijuana than drink. In the cartoon, it shows an image of a man and a woman fighting, with the caption explains that alcohol makes people 'aggressive.'

This isn't the first time the police have been called in to break up a fight between the couple.

In April of 2011, Rumph was suspected of flattening the tires on Price's car, as well as smashing its windows. Additionally, she was accused of breaking an apartment window as Price was on the phone calling 9-1-1.

In that case, prosecutors again declined to file charges against Rumph.

Initially, Rumph was booked into jail on misdemeanor domestic battery charges. She was released on $250 bond.

It's unclear why prosecutors declined to charge Rumph with any crimes.
