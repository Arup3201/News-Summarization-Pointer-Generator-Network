Stick men, scribbles and smiley faces might be what you would expect to see inside the notebooks of bored students.

But the discovery of doodles adorning the margins and blank pages of the world's oldest manuscripts prove that medieval scribes got just as distracted at work as you do. 

Dr Erik Kwakkel, a book historian from Leiden University, Netherlands, revealed that there are two types of medieval doodle.

Dr Erik Kwakkel, a book historian from Leiden University, Netherlands, believes the doodles, often made by monastic scribes  are 'the closest we can get to the users of these books and their lives'

He highlighted the idle shapes that we all produce and also said the monastic scribes would perform 'pen trials' to get the nibs of the quills flowing after regular cutting.

The least imaginative doodlers would write, repeatedly, 'probatio pennae' ('I test my pen').

Dr Kwakkel told the Independent on Sunday: 'This was a time when a book cost as much as a second-hand car today and there was no scrap paper.

'One of the few places you could test your pen were the pages of completed books.

Dr Kwakkel uses these accidental signatures to trace the movement and work of scribes

'They are the closest we can get to the users of these books and their lives.'

The 44-year-old has studied scribes who moved from the Netherlands to Kent.

'You can see how they adapted their writing style. But when you look at their pen trials, they switch back,' he said.

Dr Kwakkel uses these accidental signatures to trace the movement and work of scribes, the nameless printers and photocopiers of their time.

They also offer clues about personality and mood, with law manuscripts featuring more smiley faces than other types of work, the academic says. 

'In general there is hardly any book that doesn't have at least one addition to the text. Some books have lots from different scribes, opening a window on the scriptorium, writing room].'
