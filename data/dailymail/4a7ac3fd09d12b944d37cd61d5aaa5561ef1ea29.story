The soldier on trial for the deadly 2009 shooting rampage at Fort Hood refused to put up a fight on Wednesday, resting his case without calling a single witness or testifying in his own defense.

Major Nidal Hasan could face the death penalty if convicted for the attack that killed 13 people and wounded more than 30 others at the Texas military base. But when given the chance to rebut prosecutors' lengthy case - which included nearly 90 witnesses - the Army psychiatrist declined.

About five minutes after court began Wednesday, a day after prosecutors rested their case, the judge asked Hasan how he wanted to proceed. He answered: ‘The defense rests.’

Brief: Court was adjourned after five minutes without Hasan even defending himself

Snapped? Hasan was an Army psychiatrist until 2009, when he admits to killing 13 and injuring 30. He was found guilty today on all counts of against him

The judge, Colonel Tara Osborn, then 
asked Hasan: ‘You have the absolute right to remain silent. You do not 
have to say anything. You have the right to testify if you choose. 
Understand?’

Hasan answered that he did. When the judge asked if this was his personal decision, he said: ‘It is.’

Osborn
 then adjourned the trial until Thursday morning, agreeing to give 
prosecutors an extra day to prepare their closing arguments. Jurors were
 led out of the courtroom.

Hasan's
 move wasn't completely unexpected. He has made no attempt since he 
trial began two weeks ago to prove his innocence. He also has done 
little to challenge the narrative of military prosecutors, who showed 
evidence of Hasan's laptop being used to search the Internet for ‘jihad’
 and find articles about calls to attack Americans in the days and even 
hours before the Nov. 5, 2009, shooting.

He has sat mostly silent, raising few objections, declining to let military lawyers take over his defense and questioning only three of prosecutors' witnesses. Several of those witnesses were shot during the attack and recalled hearing a shout of ‘Allahu Akbar!’ - Arabic for ‘God is great!’ - inside a crowded medical building before Hasan opened fire using a laser-sighted handgun.

Hasan, an American-born Muslim, suggested before trial that he wanted to argue that the killings were in defense of Taliban fighters in Afghanistan, but that strategy was rejected by the judge.

Since then, he has offered little for jurors to consider. In fact, during a brief opening statement, Hasan said evidence would show he was the shooter and called himself a soldier who had ‘switched sides’ in a war.

No go: Judge Colonel Tara Osborn refused to allow Hasan to argue he was defending the Taliban when he killed 13 people and injured 30 others. Hasan has said little since the ruling

Paralyzed: A wheelchair is pushed through a secured gate to the courthouse before Major Nidal Hasan arrived Wednesday. Hasan was paralyzed when fire was returned in the 2009 attack

Lopsided: U.S. Army Cololnels Steve Henricks, left, and Mike Mulligan, right, of the prosecution, arrive to court Wednesday. The prosecution called nearly 90 witnesses

Frenzy: Members of the media are escorted by U.S. Army personnel into the Lawrence H. Williams Judicial Center for proceedings Wednesday

Secured: A Fort Hood Police Mobile Command Center is stationed outside the proceedings Wednesday in which Hasan rested his case after five minutes, no witnesses, and without testifying on his own behalf

Suspicions about Hasan's defense strategy elevated as the trial dragged on, as he leaked documents to journalists revealing that he told military mental health workers after the attack that he could ‘still be a martyr’ if convicted and executed by the government.

Yet he never played the role of a high-threat, angry extremist in court. Hasan, who was paralyzed from the waist down after being shot by Fort Hood police officers responding to the rampage, didn't get agitated in court or raise his voice.

But that passive and muted presence convinced his court-ordered, standby attorneys that he was trying to convince jurors to convict him and sentence him to death. The attorneys had asked that their advisory roles be minimized, saying Hasan's defense strategy was ‘repugnant,’ but the judge refused.

Scrutiny: Media scrutiny has been intense in the case which has drawn the attention of much of the world since the 2009 incident in which Hasan admits to killing 13

Making his case: Hasan, seen with a beard in court on August 8, is serving as his own lawyer in the case but has two standby defense attorneys on hand

Hasan began the trial signaling that he would call on just two people to testify - one a mitigation expert in capital murder cases and the other a California professor of psychology and religion.

But on Tuesday, he indicated to the judge that he would now call neither witness. That left even Osborn raising her own skepticism that Hasan would seize his last chance to defend himself.

Prosecutors were expected to give their closing argument on Thursday, though it was unclear whether Hasan would do the same.
