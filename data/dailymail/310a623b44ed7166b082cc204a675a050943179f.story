Eden Hazard may be the best player in the Premier League ‘by a mile’, according to one full-back tasked with shackling the 23-year-old — but Wales would not swap Gareth Bale for even the most gifted of Belgium’s golden generation.

Swansea’s Neil Taylor will face Hazard in an important game on the path to Euro 2016 qualification at the King Baudouin Stadium on Sunday night, aware the Chelsea forward can go past defenders ‘like a ghost’.

But Taylor says Hazard cannot compare to Bale, who thrives under the Welsh spotlight after dealing with the pressure at Real Madrid.

‘Hazard has developed under Jose Mourinho,’ said Taylor. ‘He’s the best player in the Premier League by a mile, I’d say. Mourinho has done that — he’s on a player if they don’t perform. Hazard is doing it week in, week out. He’s a ball carrier, he can take Chelsea from the edge of their box to the opposition area and go past you like a ghost. He can go outside or inside, shoot, or make you foul him.

‘He’s a great player. But we have one of our own. Of course, I’d always have Gareth in my team before Hazard. No question. I played against him when he was at Spurs, but played with him throughout the Welsh age groups. He is one of those freaks of nature who come along every now and then, technically and athletically. He’s world class like the Messis and Ronaldos. They were born to play football.

‘The pressure is on him at Real just to train properly, let alone win every game. He’s matured, and physically grown into a proper man. It seems as if he’s learning off Ronaldo and others at Real, how they work day to day. I’m sure England and other nations wish he was their player. But he’s so proud to be Welsh and he wants to be a part of this squad. He has grown in confidence in the last year. He knows the onus is on him now and that he’s our biggest player.’

Bale did not score in the last two qualifiers against Bosnia and Cyprus, which yielded four points to send Wales top of Group B, but he performed superbly in the absence of Aaron Ramsey and Joe Allen.

And it is not just his Welsh team-mates who value Bale — so too do his former colleagues at Tottenham, who Bale left behind when he joined Real for a world-record £86 million fee. Nacer Chadli, who should appear alongside Hazard for Belgium, is having a fine season for Spurs and has scored six Premier League goals but his club have struggled and lie 12th in the table.

‘I feel like the ghost of Bale is still present at Tottenham,’ he said. ‘That’s not strange when you look at how much he meant to the club and the fans. It’s not easy to replace him.’

Belgium’s Jan Vertonghen, another of Bale’s former club mates, will not be man-marking the Real star.

‘It’s very difficult to mark him,’ he said. ‘You mark him as a team. Space is the most important thing for him so communication is important between our defenders and central midfield. He’s an unbelievable player.’

Bale is under no illusions of the task but he remains confident. He said: ‘They’re fourth in the world so they’re a very good side. We know what qualities they have, but we also know what weaknesses they have. We’ll be giving it our best go and hopefully we’ll get the three points.’
