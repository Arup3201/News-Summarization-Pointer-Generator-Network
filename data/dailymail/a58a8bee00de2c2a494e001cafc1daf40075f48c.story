Just when she thought she was catch of the day, a Darwin woman suffered a head injury  when she was hit in the head by a fishing lure at a restaurant.

Helen Bull was dining on the balcony of The Jetty Restaurant at Stokes Hill Wharf with her brother when some kids were throwing lures around 8pm on Monday.

The Woolner resident said she was not hooked but was smacked 'about an inch and a half' above her eye.

'We made a bit of a passing joke that they better not start throwing them this way,' she told NT News.

'Then the next thing you know I saw this glint coming towards me.

'I felt like someone had shot me in the head. It threw me back. It was a really hard bang.

'I put my hands up to my face and when I pulled my hands down blood was pouring from my head and pouring down my neck and top.

'It is a bit blurry for me and hard to remember because I was a bit dazed and confused. There was a lot of blood there.

'Everyone from my table got up and put napkins around my head.'

Ms Bull was treated on the spot by army medics who were sitting on the next table  before she went to hospital.

Ms Bull was forced to wait for two hours but left when she was told it would take another five hours in the emergency department of Royal Darwin Hospital.

When Ms Bull returned the next day, she was told that her medics had done such a good job that she didn't require stitches.

'I guess it should be noted that the area was a not fishing area and it is for this reason,' she said.
