Ian Holloway insisted he will have to discipline Matthew Briggs after the defender was sent off against Wycombe Wanderers last night.

Briggs took his shirt off after scoring what turned out to be the winner in the first half. Referee Andy D'Urso booked the defender for his celebration, and then showed him a second yellow for a reckless challenge after the break.

Holloway said: 'I’m going to have to discipline Briggsy. You’ve just got to keep your shirt on, haven’t you? It was totally unprofessional.'

Discipline: Holloway said he will have to discipline Briggs for his unprofessional behaviour during the match 

The 23-year-old defender replied: 'It was silly and won’t happen again.'

Holloway's side have enjoyed a strong start to the season. They beat Leeds 2-0 in their Championship opener and last night they saw off Wycombe 1-0 in the Capital One Cup.

Next up for The Lions is a trip across London as they face Championship new boys Fulham at Craven Cottage. Millwall will host Holloway's old side Blackpool later his month.
