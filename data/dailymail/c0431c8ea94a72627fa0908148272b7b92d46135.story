Plans for a 1.5billion euro ‘Dubai style’ island off the Barcelona coast have sparked outrage in the Catalan city.

The island would feature a 984ft Space Hotel equipped with the world’s first ‘zero gravity’ spa.

A request for planning permission was lodged with Barcelona City Hall last week by US-based consortium Mobilona.

Cosmic: The island will have a 984ft space hotel with amazing views of the coast

Investment: The company will put 1.5billion euros into the project that will transform Barcelona

They plan to make an initial investment of 1.5billion euros to create the complex which will also have a 24-hour shopping mall, a marina and private apartments.

Some of the homes will be available on a ‘timeshare’ costing 20,000 euros for one week per year.

But planning department officials have claimed that the plans are not in keeping with the city.

Mayor of Barcelona, Xavier Trias, told the Telegraph: ‘We have no need or desire to take on projects of this nature.

‘We are a city of culture, knowledge, of creativity, and of innovation, and our project (for the city) will follow a different path. 

‘We have no intention of turning Barcelona into a spectacle.’

The hotel will feature 2,000 rooms costing from 300 euros to 1,500 euros per night.

It will also have a six-storey penthouse complete with infinity pool, helipad and mooring for a superyacht.

Mobilona CEO Jerome Bottari said that hotel guests would be able to participate in ‘space’ related activities such as experiencing weightlessness in a wind tunnel.

He added: ‘When guests are ready to 
return from their space exploration, they will be able to turn off all 
transparent glass displays with the push of a button. 

Disagree: City Hall does not believe that the project would be in keeping with Barcelona's style

Design: Artwork on the coastline of Barcelona. The city is famous for its culture

‘They can then see through them to enjoy the beautiful sea views outside, take a breath of fresh air on their private terraces or visit one of the many parks, pools and beaches around the covered marina on Barcelona Island.’

Mobilona plan for three space hotels across the world, also located in Los Angeles and Hong Kong. The three new hotels represent an estimated value of over $6 billion.
