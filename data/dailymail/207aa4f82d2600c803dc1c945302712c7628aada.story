Vladimir Putin today accused the Ukrainians of 'constantly shelling' the MH17 crash site amid steeply rising concern in the West that he has ordered massive military reinforcements to bolster pro-Moscow rebel forces.

At least 21 trucks, six tanks and 14 howitzer cannons were seen driving through rebel-territory to Donetsk today, while residents reported a convoy of 12 unmarked military trucks.

Ukraine alleges that recent days have seen a huge increase in military hardware, professional soldiers and AK-74 assault rifles fitted with laser pointers moving towards Donetsk from Russia.

Today, scores of military vehicles were seen moving near Donetsk and farther to the east, following reports by a neutral intergovernmental watchdog of armed column without insignia in rebel territory. 

Two Ukrainian soldiers were killed and five more injured in the 'anti-terrorist operation zone' over the past 24 hours. 

Moving in: A Pro-Russian rebel military vehicles convoy was seen moving towards Donetsk on Monday

At least one vehicle in the convoy carried a Russian flag, and many of the of the unmarked vehicles were towing artillery. 

Two columns of hardware consisting of 50 tented KamAZ lorries were observed moving from Russia in the direction of Snizhne on 8 November, said spokesman for the National Security and Defence Council Andriy Lysenko.

Almost every lorry was transporting an artillery system behind it, he claimed

Another column was spotted on Sunday. It consisted of tanks and self-propelled artillery systems.

A shipment of new AK-74 assault rifles fitted with laser pointers was brought from Russia to Donetsk, he alleged.

'These are regular AK-74s, but they are fitted with laser pointers. We do not know for sure how many of them there are,' he said.

'They are reinforcing the terrorist forces with arms and personnel from the Russian Armed Forces. There is no doubt that professional Russian servicemen are managing this equipment,' said Lysenko.

The Organisation for Security and Co-operation in Europe confirmed its own sightings by its Special Monitoring Mission to Ukraine in recent days.

This included two convoys of 17 military vehicles each spotted on 8 November around Sverdlove, nine miles east of Donetsk

In the first convoy five vehicles 'were towing Grad multiple-launch rocket systems. Two were loaded with ammunition crates'.

The Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe(OSCE), which operates in East Ukraine and is widely seen as neutral, also reported an unidentified armoured column in rebel territory this weekend

'The past week was characterised by an increase in the
intensity of shelling and the transfer of additional force:
ammunition, equipment and personnel, to terrorist groups,'
Lysenko said.

This comes as Russian President Vladimir Putin accused the Ukranian government of delaying the investigation of the MH17 crash site by shelling rebel-held areas in eastern Ukraine.

Putin told Malaysian Prime Minister Najib Razak that rebels were not hindering access to the site of the Malaysia Airlines crash, in which 298 people died in July when the aircraft came down in an area controlled by pro-Russian separatists.

'Of course the rebels are not shooting, that is done by the various military groups fighting on the side of Ukraine's official authorities,' Putin was quoted as saying by state news agency RIA-Novosti.

'The opposite side is constantly shelling this territory and that does not permit comprehensive working at the site of the crash,' Putin told Razak as the two met on the sidelines of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation summit in Beijing.

Firing off: Russian President Vladimir Putin has accused the Ukranian government of delaying the investigation of the MH17 crash site by shelling rebel-held areas in eastern Ukraine.

Ukraine and the West blame Russia for supplying the separatists with the Buk surface-to-air missile that shot down the Boeing 777 plane on July 17, while Moscow and the rebels have pointed the finger at Kiev.

Five more coffins of passengers who were on the Amsterdam-Kuala Lumpur flight were flown to the Netherlands on Saturday for identification. 

Putin's accusations follows the heaviest
shelling in eastern Ukraine since early October. Sunday's strikes appeared
to come from territory held by both government and rebel forces.

Intense
shelling by heavy artillery continued throughout the night and
into the early hours, and then picked up again later on Sunday
morning. The shelling could be heard in the centre of the city,
which had a pre-conflict population of more than 1 million.
