Soaring numbers of men and women are having ‘last-resort’ weight-loss surgery on the Health Service, costing taxpayers up to £85million a year.

Official figures reveal the number of gastric bypass operations on the NHS has risen sixfold in just five years.

The operation, which costs up to £15,000, was carried out 5,407 times last year, compared to 858 procedures in 2006/07.

Gastric operations should be the last resort, said Health Minister Simon Burns, but numbers are rising

Gastric band surgery, which is cheaper but less effective, is also being increasingly used. Some 1,316 operations were carried out in England in 2011/12 – twice as many as five years earlier, figures from the NHS Information Centre show.

Many more operations would have been paid for privately.Gastric bypass operations typically cost the NHS between £8,000 and £14,000 per patient, while banding costs £5,000 to £7,000, meaning the NHS spent up to £85million on the operations last year.

Experts attribute the rise to a greater acceptance of the safety and effectiveness of weight-loss surgery, and to growing numbers of people becoming hugely overweight.

NHS guidelines say patients must have tried all other weight-loss methods and be dangerously obese, with a BMI, or body mass index, of 40-plus.

To have a BMI of 40, a woman who is 5ft 4in would have to weigh just over 17 stone.

Dr David Haslam, chairman of the National Obesity Forum, said: ‘The gastric bypass is among the clinically effective and cost-effective procedures in the whole field of medicine and even the most cynical, fat-phobic taxpayer should welcome the rise.’

But Paul Sacher, co-founder of Mend, a group that provides free, healthy-lifestyle programmes for families, said: ‘It is extremely concerning to see the number of gastric bypass operations taking place in England is continuing to dramatically increase.

'It’s important that families get the help and support they need early on before their obesity reaches the severe stage.’

Previous research from Imperial College London suggest numbers have risen because more obese patients are aware surgery can help them.

The British Obesity and Metabolic Surgery Society (BOMSS) said gastric bypass operations had proven to be the most effective surgery to ensure long-term weight loss.

The society has now called on the Department of Health to guarantee patients have equal access to the treatment.

Gastric Bypass

Weight-loss operations, sometimes called
'bariatric surgery', work by restricting the amount of nutrients that 
can be digested and absorbed by the intestine.

Gastric banding involves reducing the size of the stomach with a band fitted around it, while a gastric bypass re-routes food to a small stomach pouch created by surgeons. A third, less frequently used procedure, removes a portion of the stomach.

The figures for NHS hospitals in England show a total of 18,577 gastric bypass and 7,650 gastric band operations were carried out between April 2006 and March 2012. There were 433 surgical procedures to remove gastric bands over the same period.

NHS figures also show 4,581 gastric band maintenance operations were completed between April 2009 and March 2012.

Weight loss after a gastric bypass is usually more impressive than after a gastric band, according to the NHS website.

Most people with a gastric band will lose around half their excess body weight, whereas the majority of patients with a gastric bypass will lose around two-thirds of the excess body weight.

The risk of any sort of complication after a gastric band is around one in 10 compared to one in five for a gastric bypass.

The risk of death shortly after a gastric band is around one in 200 compared to one in 100 for a gastric bypass.

Weight loss surgery

Patients are required to take nutritional supplements for the rest of their lives following a gastric bypass procedure.

BOMSS president Alberic Fiennes said:
'There is compelling evidence that weight-loss surgery to treat the 
most severely affected is one of the most clinically effective, safe and
cost effective treatments available.

'There are about 1.5 million such 
adults in the UK. They face premature death, disease and disability 
brought on as a direct result of their condition.

'These can be prevented, improved or 
eliminated by surgery. While the increase in bariatric surgery is 
welcomed by the BOMSS and the Royal College of Surgeons, we remain 
concerned that there is unequal access to treatment across the UK.

'We therefore call on the Department 
of Health to invest in a long term strategy to ensure that all patients 
have equal access to this life-saving treatment.'

Mr Fiennes added: 'Evidence suggests 
that gastric bypass operations may be more effective in the long-term. 
It also has also been shown to bring about a direct and immediate 
improvement in patients with type 2 diabetes, in addition to the 
benefits of weight loss.'

Health minister Simon Burns said: 'We want people to live healthier lives so they do not need to resort to surgery, but as a last resort, doctors can advise procedures like these are undertaken.

'We are working with charities, local government and industry to make it easier for people to make better choices to prevent obesity in the first place.

'This year a third of meals and takeaways served from popular high street chains will contain calorie information and over a million families are involved in our Change4Life campaign - helping people to eat well and move more.'
