When father-of-two Kamal Hussain received a letter from school saying classes would be ending early for staff development, he duly arranged for his children to have the afternoon off.

But he became suspicious when he spotted three teachers in smart clothing driving past him when they were meant to be at school for the ‘inset’ (which stands for ‘in-service training’) afternoon.

Calling in at the deserted school, he was told by a cleaner that the head and teachers had gone to a colleague’s wedding.

A furious Mr Hussain then drove to the wedding venue and confronted the head, who he says was sitting with 23 of her staff.

Mr Hussain yesterday lambasted head 
Gillian Pursey, for sending a ‘blatant lie’ in an official letter to 
parents. He said: ‘I was just so angry and furious. I teach my children 
not to lie – what sort of example does that set?

‘I’ve lost my trust and confidence in them and I’m going to look to move my children elsewhere.’

He called for an inquiry into the matter, saying pupils had lost hundreds of hours of teaching between them.

Shut: St Hilda's Primary School, in Oldham, which closed so staff could go to a wedding

Mrs Pursey, 51, head of St Hilda’s 
Primary School, Oldham, sent a letter saying classes would end at 2pm on
 Tuesday, October 30, instead of 3.30pm, for ‘staff development’.

Teachers are entitled up to five days at school without pupils present so they can carry out administrative tasks or training.

However, Mr Hussain, 35, who had 
recently been refused time off for his own children to attend a family 
wedding, found Mrs Pursey and up to 23 of her staff sitting down for a 
meal at a colleague’s wedding.

When he confronted Mrs Pursey at her 
table, she claimed the teachers had been given time off to ‘do 
research’, adding she had the governors’ permission.

Mr Hussain added: ‘But to my 
understanding the governors don’t have the real authority to put in 
jeopardy the education of 500 pupils.’

Last night Mrs Pursey said: ‘Staff 
were given that hour and a half of staff development time to research 
things for the school’s golden jubilee celebrations.

‘They could do that research on or off
 site, and whenever they liked. Some decided to do it straight away, and
 others decided to do it after the wedding.

‘It was all agreed with the school governors and is all  above board.’

An Oldham Council spokesman said: ‘This is an interim management issue for the school and no action will be taken.’
