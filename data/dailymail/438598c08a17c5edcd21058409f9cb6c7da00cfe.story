Perhaps it was his rather suspicious-sounding name that first led police to one suspect's alleged $10,000 of marijuana. 

Paul Scott Stoner, 42, was charged last Thursday with growing marijuana and having a firearm while in possession of more than a pound of marijuana.

The suspect, from Unionville, Virginia, had been growing thousands of dollars worth of cannabis plants at his home.

The charges stemmed from an ongoing investigation related to the alleged sale of marijuana to children in Orange County. Further charges are pending.

Authorities say they acted on a tip that Stoner was selling to children and during the search last Thursday seized marijuana, marijuana plants, drug paraphernalia, prescription drugs, needles, spoons and guns.

The Blue Ridge Narcotics and Gang Task Force raided Stoner's home on August 14.  

Stoner is free on bond. A hearing is set for August 27.

The Department of Social Services is also involved in the investigation.  

An on-going investigation found that Stoner had been selling drugs to children from his Virginia home
