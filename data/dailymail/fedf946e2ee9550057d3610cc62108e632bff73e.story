This is the adorable moment a father caught his one-year-old twin girls playing a game of peekaboo after they had been put to bed.  

Molly and Megan Keher were supposed to be sleeping when their father, Andy, heard his baby daughter's giggling from the hallway of their Liverpool home.

Armed with his mobile phone, Mr Keher, 31, crept down the corridor to see what had captured the imaginations of his little girls and watched as they played peekaboo in their cots for almost a minute and a half before he was spotted by Molly.

Now you see us, now you don't: The little girls enjoy their peekaboo game, unaware their father was watching 

'They go to bed at 7.30pm and they're supposed to be asleep by 8pm but somebody forgot to turn the light off,' said Mr Keher.

'It was the first time I'd seen them playing peekaboo which is more why I filmed it than anything else.'

The clip has since gone viral, amassing 1.6 million views on Mr Keher's Facebook page to the surprise of Mr Keher and wife Lucy, 32.

Playful: Mr Keher said he had filmed the babies as it was the first time he had seen Megan (left) and Molly playing peekaboo with one another

'I don't know what happened but I posted it and went to bed and the next morning, things had gone a little bit crazy,' he said.

And the twins' online fame has led to them being recognised by one very excited parent as they arrived at a childcare centre. 

'The woman couldn't believe it when she saw them – she was like "I can't believe they go to our childcare centre",' said Mr Keher, who works as a wedding photographer.

The proud father, who said he would celebrate the twins' fame by buying them a new cuddly toy, said the girls – identical twins – were as different as night and day.

'They're supposed to be identical but their personalities are so different – Molly is very much the boss and Megan is the dizzy princess,' he said.

'Megan won't feed herself, she insists on being fed like a princess would whereas Molly will grab the bowl out of your hand and throw it to the floor.'
