Police in Aruba are searching for the people in this white car who they believe could provide the testimony that helps charge murder suspect Gary Giordano with the killing of American tourist Robyn Gardner.

Officers have released the security camera image of the small white car driving away from where the missing 35-year-old was last seen over a month ago in the hopes of finding more witnesses in the case.

Giordano, 50, is the only suspect in the disappearance and is being held in custody for 60 days, but police need more evidence to charge him with murder.

Key witnesses? Police are trying to trace the people in this white car seen close to where Robyn Gardner disappeared

Insurance: Gary Giordano tried to redeem 
accidental death policy on missing woman Robyn Gardner, which named him 
as a beneficiary, days before their trip to the Dutch Caribbean island 
of Aruba

A judge on Wednesday ordered that Giordano be detained for at least 60 more days while prosecutors seek more evidence against him.

But his lawyer, who said he denies committing any crime, will today file an appeal in the case.

Michael Lopez will appear before a three-judge panel on behalf of the suspect to ask that he be released.

Prosecutors said the driver or passengers in the Hyundai Getz may have seen the missing woman or the suspect in her presumed death.

They said the photo was taken at 5:59pm near to where the Gaithersburg, Maryland, man claims Ms Gardner was swept out to sea while they were snorkelling on August 2.

The vehicle was being driven north between the Rum Reef Restaurant and the sea.

Officers believe the people inside may have seen the Toyota RAV4 that Giordano and Ms Gardner were using during their trip to the island or the couple themselves.

Gardner's disappearance, but said they have had trouble identifying him 
in surveillance video because he frequently changes his toupees.

Video shows the pair at the Rum Beef Bar & Grill in the Baby Beach area of the island where Ms Gardner went missing.

Restaurant staff have told investigators that the woman seemed woozy while they ate.

Surveillance
footage also shows Giordano in his rental car at the back of the 
restaurant, but the car had tinted windows so no one else in the vehicle
can be seen.

Giordano initially assisted the search but 
was detained at the airport as he tried to leave the country because of 
questions about his account of what happened.

Friends said the couple had met on a swingers sex website.
