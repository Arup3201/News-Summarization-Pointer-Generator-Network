Forget prawns, this year it's mussels that could be all the go this Christmas. 

It’s an Australian tradition to have seafood for Christmas lunch or dinner. But never mind prawns; freshly shucked oysters, salmon canapés, and crab salad are also all passé - it's blue mussels that were the connoisseurs’ choice at the 19th annual 36-Hour Seafood Marathon in Sydney Fish Market. 

The event saw the first of the Christmas catch sold at 5am on Tuesday, with trade continuing non-stop until 5pm on Wednesday, Christmas Eve. Current sales indicate that produce sold will be up on last year's figures, and blue oysters will be a popular choice.

As usual at the fish market prawns are very popular with local customers in Sydney 

'If you're looking for something a little different and a litter cheaper, but still very, very nice, then the blue mussels are a good buy at the moment,' said Brian Skepper, seafood expert and general manager of Sydney Fish Market. 'There's been good supplies around for them. Having them in a simple white wine sauce is as good a meal as you'll get anywhere this Christmas. 

'Our climate lends itself to have seafood for lunch. It just makes sense. Christmas is by far the busiest time of the year for us now as far as seafood sales.

'The next is Easter followed by Chinese New Year. It has become a tradition in Sydney at Christmas to come down to the seafood marathon and do your Christmas food shopping.

‘Even at midnight the place is really buzzing. You’ll often see a family down shopping together for seafood for their Christmas lunch.'

Apart from the blue mussels that sell for between $7-$11 a kilo, the selection is huge. The favourites tend to be prawns and oysters. Over the 36-hour period about 120 tonnes of prawns – about 55 kilograms every minute – will be sold. 70,000 dozen oysters will also be sold – almost 390 Oysters per minute. 

Based on prior years organisers are expecting to have over 100,000 people visit the market during the 36-hour period. Approximately 600 tonnes of fresh seafood will be sold through the wholesale market and retailers during this time.

It's a Smörgåsbord of seafood. Depending on whether you buy a king prawn or a farm prawn they’ll range between $18-$40 a kilo. Pacific oysters sell at between $12-$18 a dozen. Sydney rock oysters between $14-$18 a dozen.

In terms of fish, snapper, barramundi and Atlantic salmon are all the most popular. But winter species such as filleted fish are not worth considering during the festive season. For the big spenders, Eastern rock lobster is right at the top end of the market and range from $99-$100 a kilo.

It is one thing buying the fish and another thing trying to pick the freshest ones though. 

‘Look for product that’s in tact and has good colour. Fish should have firm flesh and bright eyes. They should have pink-red gills and should have a fresh seafood smell to it,' Mr Skepper explained.

‘Then when you purchase your seafood it's critical to keep it cold. Bring an Esky, get the fishmonger to put a bit of ice in it, take it home and get it into the coolest part of the fridge. 

'Providing you keep it below four degrees it’ll keep for well up to two or three days.’

He also advised people to come to the market sooner rather than later as people usually leave coming to the last minute. 

'Generally there’s a peak at 11pm tonight (Tuesday). People go out for dinner then call in here on their way home.

Early in the morning on Wednesday, which is Christmas Eve, is another good time to come. After that it can get very busy as most of us like to leave our shopping to the last minute.'
