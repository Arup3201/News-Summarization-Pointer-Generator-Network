Journalist James Foley suffered horrifying torture at the hands of his ISIS captors before they killed him, including waterboarding, virtual starvation and being hung upside-down by his ankles.

Foley, 40, was killed in a graphic propaganda video released in August by the terrorist organization, which calls itself the Islamic State - but new details from his two years in captivity are still emerging.

Fellow captives have now spoken out about their time in prison with Foley, whom they referred to as a pillar of strength. They revealed that he received the most brutal treatment out of dozens of hostages because he was American.

Foley, from Rochester, New Hampshire, was captured not far from the Syrian border with Turkey in 2012 by a small jihadist group which would later swear fealty to ISIS.

As the group gained strength, his treatment worsened, according to a lengthy account of his capture and captivity published by the New York Times. 

As early as August 2013 - before ISIS caught the world's attention with its huge land grab in Iraq - Foley would regularly be lashed to a metal bar by the ankles and left dangling from the ceiling for hours.

This element of his torture was revealed by Jejoen Bontinck, a 19-year-old Belgian who shared a cell with him.

He told the Times: 'You could see the scars on his ankles. He told me how they had chained his feet to a bar and then hung the bar so that he was upside down from the ceiling.'

Later, after Foley was handed over to a central ISIS prison in Syria, with dozens of other captives, the torture became more targeted and extreme.

Initially dozens of Western captives were held together, but ISIS began to release those whose governments would pay large ransoms for them.

Eventually only Britons and Americans - whose governments refuse to pay out - were left, and the regime grew harsher.

Former cellmates have said that Foley was routinely the victim of mock executions - and even waterboarding.

One told how when Foley was taken from his cell by his captors, they would pray for him to return covered in blood, as if he was unmarked it would be a sign of even more savage treatments, such as the waterboarding technique, which simulates drowning.

ISIS has said they employ that form of torture as a direct response to the U.S. government's waterboarding of Al-Qaeda captives as part of the war on terror.

In particularly bleak periods of captivity, the prisoners would also be practically starved, given the equivalent of a teacup full of food every day.

As the prisoners were often kept in almost total darkness, they would often spill what little food they had as they attempted to eat.

Despite all this, Foley would share his limited rations with other captives, and gave up his blanket to somebody else in the depths of winter, other prisoners said.

In a letter to Foley's family smuggled out by a fellow captive, he gives a more positive outlook of his captivity, and makes no mention of torture.

He wrote: 'I have had weak and strong days. We are so grateful when anyone is freed; but of course, yearn for our own freedom. We try to encourage each other and share strength.

Threats: ISIS released the videos showing the deaths of captives such as Foley, pictured above. They have been exclusively from the United Kingdom and the U.S. - whose governments do not pay ransoms

'We are being fed better now and daily. We have tea, occasional coffee. I have regained most of my weight lost last year.'

However, the letter implies that he has an inkling of his fate to come - one sentence of the message instructs his family on what to do with any money in his bank account should he die. 

ISIS itself has freely admitted that it waterboards prisoners, though it claims that they are in general 'treated well'.

In a new propaganda video released this week, British war photographer John Cantile was put in front of the camera to describe his captivity.

He said: 'Now unless we tried something stupid like escaping or doing something we shouldn't, we were treated well by the Islamic State.

Admission: A new ISIS video featuring British photographer John Cantile was released this week, in which he said captives are waterboarded if they try 'something stupid'

'Some of us who tried to escape were waterboarded by our captors as Muslim prisoners are waterboarded by their American captors.

'Our strange little community of prisoners had its share of problems but apart from the odd fight we lived together in relative harmony through uncertain times.

'We read books, played recreational games and gave lectures on our specialist subjects. It wasn't a bad life.'

He then described how successive European prisoners - Spanish, French, German and Danish - were let go while the British and American governments 'stone-walled' ISIS attempts to acquire ransoms.

Cantile is the latest Westerner whom ISIS have indicated they are going to murder. There are also fears for Peter Kassig, an aid worker from Indianapolis.

Videos showing the murders of American journalist Steven Sotloff, British humanitarian Alan Henning and David Haines, another British aid worker, have also been released.
