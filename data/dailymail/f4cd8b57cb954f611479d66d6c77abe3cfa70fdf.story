A white-skinned Indian couple are set to enter the record books along with their offspring, after becoming the world's biggest albino family.

The ten members of the Pullan family, headed by Rosetauri, 50, and his wife Mani, 45, all have the extremely pale skin and near-white hair of albinos.

But despite years of prejudice and suffering the poor vision which is a side effect of the condition, the Pullans and their eight other family members are set to land a Guinness World Record.

The Pullan children Shankar, 24, Ramkishan, 19, and Vijay, 25 (back row), along with daughters Deepa, 21 (left) and Pooja, 18 (right) all inherited albinismn from their father Rosetauri and mother Mani (centre)

The Pullan family say that despite their condition, they are looking forward to global recognition as the world's biggest albino family

The Pullan's sons Shankar, 24, Vijay, 25 and Ramkishan, 19, and daughters Renu, 23, Deepa, 21 and Pooja, 18, inherited their albinism, according to The Sun.

Renu married a man who also had albinism, Rosheh, 27, and the couple's son Dharamraj, 2, also inherited the condition from his parents.

The family live in a one-bedroom flat in Delhi, and say many fellow Indians find it hard to believe they were born and bred in the country.

Roseturai Pullan told The Sun: 'I've heard people call us 'angrez', which means 'English'.

New arrival: Two-year-old Dharamraj is the latest albino addition to the Pullan family

Heads of the family: Rosetauri, 50 (left) and his wife Mani (right), 45, wed in an arranged marriage in 1983

Indian born and bred: The Pullan's 24-year-old son Shankar, who was also born an albino

'All we know is that we can't see properly, and we can't sit under the sun for long, but we live the best we can.

'People in Delhi are a little more open-minded, but many think we're foreigners.'

Albinism affects around one in 17,000 people.

Those with the condition do not produce enough melanin pigment, which gives colour to the skin, hair and eyes and protects the body from the sun's rays.

The Pullans say they have endured a lot of prejudice as people find it hard to understand they are 'born and bred in India'

Younger generation: Pooja, 18, and Deepa, 21, are among the younger members of the albino Pullan family

Family plans: The Pullan's eldest son Vijay, 25, says when he has saved enough he wants to find himself an albino wife

Albinos such as the Pullans often suffer from extreme short-sightedness and a severe sensitivity to light.

After marrying in 1983, Rosetauri and Mani moved from southern India to Delhi.

The couple say they have had a 'tough life' and often been treated as outsiders, but mother Mani says despite the family's setbacks she sees the condition as a 'gift from God'.

A spokesperson for Guinness World Records said they would be contacting the Pullans to verify the record of them being the world's biggest albino family.

It is thought the current record is held by a six-strong family who live in the U.S. and Canada.
