The National Basketball Association is one of the pre-eminent sport Leagues in the world and every Thursday, Bleacher Report will bring you a round-up of all the action on and off court Stateside.

HEADLINE-MAKER 

Anthony Davis drove past Aron Baynes for a lay-up with 6.6 seconds left as the New Orleans Pelicans stunned the defending NBA champion San Antonio Spurs at the AT&T Center on Saturday night.

Davis, who finished with 27 points and 11 rebounds, has become an elite NBA superstar almost overnight. From battling injuries in his rookie year to being named an NBA All-Star in his second season, 'The Brow' has soared into MVP conversation in his third year with highlight after highlight and huge stat lines to back them up. 

Davis does not move like other athletes of his size (6ft 10in, 220lbs). He possesses a fluidity that belongs in a smaller body and he punctuates the flowing quality of his motion with short, violent, utterly startling athletic bursts. 

Never afraid of hyperbole, the 10-time All-Star told reporters before the game that the match was 'probably one of the biggest sporting events that's up there ever.' 

GOOD WEEK

Dirk Nowitzki became the top scoring international NBA player of all-time. 

He scored 23 points in the Dallas Mavericks' victory over the Sacramento Kings taking his overall tally to 26,953 and breaking Nigerian Hakeem Olajuwon's record. 

The German now sits ninth on the list of all-time NBA leading scorers with 26,953 points. Kareem Abdul-Jabbar tops the list.

'It's an honour,' said Nowitzki, who scored a mid-range shot with 8:56 remaining in Tuesday's game to pass Olajuwon. 'To do it at home, it was even more special. Getting a standing ovation, it was great. 

'Hakeem, to me, was one of the greatest. I grew up watching him in the 90s. His footwork, his touch, was next to no other. I'm really humbled to keep climbing the ladder, blessed to stay healthy, and play at a semi-high level.' 

BAD WEEK

Kobe Bryant comes away from Tuesday night's 107-102 loss to the Memphis Grizzlies with a distinction that only seems fitting at the outset of the Los Angeles Lakers' now 1-7 season. 

The 36-year-old passed John Havlicek's all-time NBA mark for missed shots with his 13,418th.

Bryant finished the game with 28 points on 26 attempts from the field - 16 of them misses, including the one in the fourth quarter that earned him the record. 

'I was just being aggressive,' Bryant told reporters after the game. 'I played with a lot of energy today. It's easy to look at it and say 37 shots, but you don't see how hard I was working to get easy opportunities, offensive rebounds and transition shots.' 

BRIT WATCH

Miami Heat's Luol Deng scored a season-high 30 points as the Heat defeated the Dallas Mavericks 105-96 on Monday. 

Deng led the scoring and was supported by Chris Bosh and Dwyane Wade who scored 20 points apiece.

Speaking after the game, Deng said: 'We still have a lot to figure out, their game plan today, they doubled Bosh and D-Wade, and we did a good job of moving the ball and had a lot of open jumpers.' 

However, the Heat are only second in the Southeast Division with a 5-3 record after losing to the Indiana Pacers at the AmericanAirlines Arena on Wednesday. 

AND FINALLY... 

Boston Celtics rookie Marcus Smart was the sixth overall pick in the 2014 NBA draft, and with that came a big NBA contract. 

Instead of blowing it all on fast cars and clothing, Smart bought his mother a beautiful home in suburban Dallas.

After making the purchase, Smart explained: 'It's probably one of the biggest accomplishments as a young man, is to give your mom what she always wanted. And to take care of her, especially after she takes care of you all those years.'
