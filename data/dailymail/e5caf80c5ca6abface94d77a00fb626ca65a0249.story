YouTube star Will Reid’s instructional video series for teens has returned to the place where it all began – the bathroom.

In the third instalment of his popular online series, the Southampton father has a simple lesson for teens who leave their wet towels on the floor.

The tongue-in-cheek clip intended for his own children, James and Beth, teaches teens – and likely some adults – how to hang their used towels on a heated towel rail.

Mr Reid then points to a heated towel rail where the towel should have been placed to dry

In the one-minute video, the self-proclaimed ‘distressed dad’ points to an offending blue towel on the floor and folds it twice before hanging it on the metal rail.

He tells the camera: ‘That’s all there is to that. Other places where towels don’t dry are on your bed, bedroom floor, hall floor, lounge floor, pretty much anywhere with the word floor in it.’

Writing on his YouTube page, he said: ‘In this episode I try and teach them how to hang up their towels so that they dry and can be used more than once!

Fold twice: Mr Reid said he will continue his YouTube series because it is annoying his children

Hang to dry: It's so easy that even a teenager can do it

‘Again, they say no one will be interested and still can't believe people watched my first video. Let's prove them wrong and show them that us parents do know what we are talking about. Please don't let me down!' 

He added: ‘You may have someone in your life that isn't a teenager but you think still needs to see this video. Please feel free to share with them too.’

Mr Reid’s first video taught teenagers how to change an empty toilet roll in the bathroom and went on to surpass four million views, making him somewhat of an online celebrity.

Will Reid's other videos have taught teens how to change a loo roll and load a dishwasher

He followed that up with a clip that shows teens – and, again, likely a lot of adults – how to load filthy cutlery and crockery into a dishwasher.

Without giving any hints he is promising to release a fourth video soon.

In his latest video, he tells the camera: ‘I’m going to continue using social media because it’s sort of getting the message across to (James and Beth) and it also annoys them’
