The search for a 23-year-old nursing student who went missing in Tennessee nearly three years ago was renewed over the weekend with authorities searching the home and property of an arrested 29 year old.

Homeowner Zachary Adams was booked in Decatur County Jail on charges of aggravated assault Friday, following another arrest for drug charges earlier in the week.

Tennesse Bureau of Investigation authorities wouldn't say whether Adams' arrest was in connection to the April 2011 disappearance of Holly Bobo, but they carried out a search warrant on his property while he was behind bars.

Investigators started searching the home of Zachary Adams (right) on Friday after he was arrested for aggravated assault. They haven't yet named him as a suspect in her disappearance

New tips: Authorities started searching Adams' property on Friday and continued throughout Sunday. Adams' house is located approximately 15 miles from Bobo's home where she went missing

Danielle Darnell, who grew up with Adams, says she was interviewed by police on Friday and told them Bobo encountered Adams and friends out on a racoon hunt a week before her disappearance.

'Holly was on stage and walking around the coon hunt and they basically followed, stalked her a bit,' Darnell told WBBJ. 'Karen [Bobo] even went up and introduced herself as Holly's mom.'

Darnell says Adams made a few comments about Bobo in the past year to close friends, and that she and others reported the comments to the TBI.

'I do believe he is involved along with three others. I just know from things I've heard,' she said.

Bobo was last seen by her brother on April 13, 2011 who saw her walking into the woods behind their Darden home with a man dressed in full camouflage.

Where is Holly? The search on Saturday seemed to focus on an abandoned building and well across the street from Adams' house

TBI Director Mark Gwyn held a press conference Friday afternoon, and said he wouldn't be revealing details about the new search so as not to jeopardize the 'vital' new information they've collected.

'This is a very important time in this investigation. We're not going to say or do anything at this point to interfere with this investigation,' said Gwyn. 'Hopefully we'll be able to return Holly home safely to her parents. That's our goal.'

They have not named Adams as a suspect in the disappearance yet, but neighbors weren't surprised to see authorities searching the reportedly unemployed man's property.

'Zach is always been in trouble. He's on drugs, really high. He has hurt his grandparents and a lot of people around here in different ways,' Ann LaMance said.

High: Neighbors have described Adams as a drug user. Before his arrest on Friday for aggravated assault, he was booked earlier in the week for a drug charge

The search of Adams' property began Friday, but switched to the property across the street the following day.

His house is located approximately 15 minutes from Bobo's home on Swan Johnson Road where she was last seen.

Locals say Bible Hill Road closely connects both Swan Johnson Road and Adams lane.

On Saturday the search seemed to focus on an abandoned building and what appeared to be a well on the property across the street.

A dive team was brought in as well as cadaver dogs, while investigators took pictures and scoured the wooded areas.

A small bobcat excavator was brought in on Sunday afternoon, and dirt was also being sifted on the property.

TBI director Gwyn says the search will continue in the coming days, despite an impending ice storm.

Terrie Bromley, a close friend of the Bobo family, is one of thousands who have aided in the search for Holly over the past three years.

She told the Jackson Sun that the woods in front of the Adams home were searched before, but never the home itself.

Bromley says Bobo was not friends Adams or even friends with his friends.

Meanwhile, about 400 friends and family gathered at Corinth baptist Church for a 12-hour vigil Saturday.

The vigil was planned before the recent developments, which church officials take as a sign of 'divine intervention'.

'We're praying for Holly and her will being, that she will either be able to escape from her captives, that's number one; that her need be met throughout the day,' Pastor Don Frank told WMC-TV.

'At this point we still believe that she's alive. Every time that they have a search and they don't find her that gives us evidence that she's still out there,' the pastor added.
