The Brazilian woman was taken to a nearby hospital by neighbours where surgeons removed over 200 needles from her scalp.

There, she was given antibiotics to prevent infection.

Speaking with Brazilian news site Globo, Ms Nabucco said: 'It was quite a shock.

'I felt something land on my head and then felt the spines with my hands. The pain was enormous.

The housewife said at least 200 needles were removed from her scalp by surgeons

'The surgeon took them out with tweezers.Â  There must have been around 200.'

'I'm a strong woman; an old person or a child would have died.

'Someone told me there was a pair of porcupines living in the area, but I had never seen them.'

The animal is said to have survived the fall.
