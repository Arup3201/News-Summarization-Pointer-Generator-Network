Carlo Ancelotti has admitted he tried to sign Liverpool captain Steven Gerrard to partner Andrea Pirlo in midfield during his time as AC Milan manager.

Ancelotti spent almost eight years at the San Siro with Italian international Pirlo and revealed he sounded out Gerrard over a move to Italy.

But Gerrard remained loyal to Liverpool, and now the pair will face each other on Wednesday when Ancelotti's Real Madrid visit Anfield in the Champions League.

Carlo Ancelotti admits he tried to sign Liverpool captain Steven Gerrard to partner Andrea Pirlo in midfield

Italy midfielder Pirlo, currently at Juventus, spent a decade at Serie A club AC Milan between 2001 and 2011

Pirlo is now 35 but still playing regularly for Juventus and has come out of international retirement

LIVERPOOL (THREE POINTS)

LOSS - 1-0 vs FC Basle

WIN - 2-1 vs Ludogorets Razgrad

REAL MADRID (SIX POINTS)

WIN - 2-1 vs Ludogorets Razgrad

WIN - 5-1 vs FC Basle 

'He's one of the players I would have loved to coach,' Ancelotti told The Sun. 

'And I thought about him so many times in the past when I was at Milan.

'But it was impossible because he was very much linked with Liverpool. We had sounded him out but Gerrard's bond with Liverpool was unbreakable.

'I don't remember exactly what year it was but we did try. Of course, I wanted to pair him up with Pirlo, it was a fantastic combination.

'Putting Gerrard in midfield with Pirlo. It would have been fantastic.' 

Liverpool meet Real at Anfield on Wednesday night with the La Liga side looking for their third win in as many Champions League games.

Brendan Rodgers' side, however, lost 1-0 against Basle at the beginning of October.

That came after last year's Premier League runners up saw off Ludogorets Razgrad 2-1 a fortnight before with a 93rd-minute penalty, scored by Gerrard.
