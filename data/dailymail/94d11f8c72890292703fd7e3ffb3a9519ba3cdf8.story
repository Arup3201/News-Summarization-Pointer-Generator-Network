A 9-year-old boy was bitten in the leg by a large alligator that was in a Florida lake.

The attack happened just after lunchtime on Thursday in Osceola County lake at East Lake Tohopekaliga.

James Barrny was riding his bicycle when he decided to take a dip in an area of the lake that is not reserved for swimming.

Survivor: James Barney, 9, was able to fight off a large alligator Thursday afternoon in an Osceola County lake, wildlife officials said

He ended up being airlifted to Arnold Palmer Hospital for Children in stable condition

Toothy: The gator sunk its teeth into boys' leg, but luckily he was able to get away

He ended up being airlifted to Arnold Palmer Hospital for Children in stable condition.

The gator was nine feet long and has left the young man with bite marks on his leg - but it could have been so much worse.

'He was just at the lakefront playing, and him and a couple of his friends - and they got in the water - they were swimming around, an alligator came up and just snatched him,' said James' grandfather, John Hayes to WKMG.

Mr Hayes said his grandson thought it was his friends playing with him.

'He was 
scared to death. He thought one of his friends was poking him and then 
all of a sudden it just grabbed him,' said Hayes. 'Then he was fighting 
with it, hitting it in the face and it finally opened its mouth a little
 bit, and he hit it again in the eye and he got away from it.'

Nearby fishermen tried to capture the 500-pound gator but it was so powerful it snapped the line.

The city of St. Cloud closed nearby swimming areas of the lake until further notice.

Once
 James' wounds have healed, he will not only have a great story to tell,
 but a souvenir as well - he was able to snag one of the gator's teeth 
when it tried to take a bite out of him.

More than 1.3 million alligators are thought to live in Florida, and gator bites are uncommon.

Alligators rarely bite people for reasons other than food, the Florida Wildlife Commission reports. Some bites occur because of 'accidental collisions,' such as if a swimmer bumps into an alligator.

FWC reports 12 people were bitten by alligators in Florida last year. Five of those bites were considered minor, seven were major and none was fatal.

The last fatal alligator bite in Florida occurred in 2007, when Justo Antonio Padron was drowned by a gator in a pond at the Miccosukee Indian Reservation in South Florida.

Witnesses told wildlife officials the gator appeared to be about nine feet in length

City officials have closed the lake to swimming while the search for the gator continues
