Divers working for organised crime gangs are using the banned practice of electro-fishing - where sea creatures are electronically stunned - to bring in hauls of  worth up to £65,000 a day.

The gangs are targeting razor clams off the coast of Argyll, west Scotland. The shellfish make up an important part of the fishing industry, contributing £3.1 million to the Scottish economy in 2013.

Detective Chief Inspector Calum Young, responsible for Argyll, Bute and West Dunbartonshire said: 'The money to organised crime and criminals is significant, it makes more than drugs does.'

But he explained that the practice was difficult to stop as unlicensed boats destroyed evidence of electro-fishing, which has been illegal since 1998, over the side of the boat when police approached.

He said that there are 80 known individuals involved in the black market fishing, many of eastern European origin, and that their sophisticated operation is very efficient.

He explained that the gangs have boats, specialist equipment and divers who are trained in electro-fishing. 

He said: 'They have a generator on the boat and deploy electrodes and probes on to the seabed and run them along the seabed, between 10 and 15 metres deep.

'The electricity stuns the razor clams and divers walk behind the boat scooping the clams up.'

'Many of the divers are known to be of eastern European origin and there is concern that they are being exploited and their personal safety is in danger - because of the proximity of electricity in water.

'There is a major concern that we will be faced with fatalities in the waters off Argyll and Bute.'

He added that they have vehicles that allow them to quickly transport their haul to Glasgow airport, where they are usually shipped within 24 hours to Asian markets via Singapore. 

The gangs also have a way of legitimising their catch for overseas sale - despite lacking legal documents - make

The practice of electro-fishing, which renders any shellfish harvested legally unfit to eat, is highly dangerous.  

It is estimated that illegally active fishing boats are taking between 500-600kg of razor clams a day, while a comparable fishing boat on a legitimate fishing trip might recover between one and two kilos a day.  

But it has been illegal since 1998 to use electro-fishing methods to harvest the shellfish. Earlier this year the Scottish Government brought in even tougher licensing laws and punishments to deter poachers.

One boat had been stopped last Thursday under suspicion of being involved in electro-fishing, Police Scotland said.

Inquiries into the ownership of the boat are understood to be ongoing by Marine Scotland. 

Last week, a multi-agency operation run from Oban, involving Police Scotland, Marine Scotland, Argyll and Bute Council and the Health and Safety Executive, kicked into action to clamp down on electro-fishing for razor clams off the coast.
