If you haven’t already done so, it is time to dig out your winter coat.

Northern counties yesterday saw the first snow of winter and tonight temperatures in southern England are expected to fall to a chilly -3C.

Hundreds of gritters were on standby to treat roads around the country last night as forecasters warned some areas were as cold as Moscow.

Milder temperatures will move in 
tomorrow, but widespread persistent rain and high winds means it will 
still be a day best spent in front of the fire.

Councils in England and Wales have 
stockpiled 1.3million ton of salt for gritting roads – enough to fill 
more than 400 Olympic-sized swimming pools and twice as much as was used
 last winter.

There was snow on the ground in 
Scotland and Northumberland yesterday, leaving a dusting on fields and 
pavements as temperatures dipped below zero.

A Met Office spokesman said the snow was falling much earlier than last year, when snowflakes were not reported until December.

Charlie Powell, a spokesman for the Met Office said: 'Some parts of the country are as cold as Moscow today. Those in Northumberland are experiencing temperatures between 3 and 4C.

'Overnight temperatures could drop to as low as -2 with a frosty start to the day tomorrow for many.

'In the north east there could be 2cm of snow today and parts of northern Scotland could see up to 5cm of snow throughout the next 24 hours.

'Parts of Lincolnshire and East Anglia could see sleet and hail showers today but I don't think we will see anything settling.

'We
 are experiencing a two day cold snap today and tomorrow. On Monday it 
will be back to wet and windy and temperatures where they should be, as 
high as 4 and 6C.'

Tony Conlan, a forecaster with MeteoGroup UK, the weather division of the Press Association, said some areas of lower ground in Scotland saw their first meaningful snow, and a 'wintry mix' of rain, sleet, hail and some snow will continue until late on Saturday.

'It will be colder today than it has been, with temperatures typically ranging from 2C (36F) in parts of the Scottish highlands to 10 or 11C (50-52F) in the far west of England' he said.

'Late on Saturday night there should 
be milder air coming in from the north west making it warmer on Sunday, 
but still not very pleasant, with rain just about everywhere.'

The Local Government Association (LGA) said that hundreds of gritters are on standby to treat roads as required.

An LGA survey of councils across 
England and Wales found there is currently about 1.3 million tonnes of 
salt in council depots - enough to fill more than 400 Olympic-sized 
swimming pools.

This is about twice as much as was used during last winter.

A spokesman said: 'Councils have invested in new fleets of GPS-tracked gritting trucks, mini-gritters and specialist vehicles for narrow and hilly streets.

'Thousands of grit bins have been placed in estates and side streets, residents have been given their own bags of salt along with salt spreaders in some neighbourhoods, and arrangements have been made with parish councils, farmers and community groups to grit hard-to-reach areas.'

Couple Helen and Jamie Sims stopped near to Kielder Forest in Northumberland so they could enjoy the pretty scenes as they drove from their home in Edinburgh to London.

Helen said: 'We’re originally from New Zealand so we haven’t seen much snow before. We weren’t expecting it so we stopped the car to enjoy the view.'

Janet Julian and her sister Margaret Brennan also stopped on their drive from South Yorkshire as they made their way to a holiday cottage in Fife.

Janet said: 'We drive this route because it’s scenic, the snow is like an added bonus.'

Thousands of migrating birds have been dying before reaching England this week because of an appalling combination of fog and winds around the coast.

Fishermen have discovered many exhausted and disorientated 'garden' birds plunging into the sea around their vessels, according to the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds (RSPB).

England's east coast, from Northumberland to Kent, has seen the arrival of many birds, including redwings, fieldfares, bramblings and blackbirds, perhaps numbering in their millions.

The charity said these were the lucky survivors which had managed to cross the North Sea, but many others might have perished before making landfall.

The skipper of a boat said: 'While fishing about 10 miles south of Portsmouth, we witnessed thousands of garden birds disorientated, land on the sea and most drowning.

'Species included goldcrests, robins, thrushes and blackbirds. The sky was thick with garden birds. I estimate I saw 500 birds die and that was just in our 300-yard sphere.'

Martin Harper, the RSPB's conservation director, said: 'The scale of these reports is truly shocking, and it has the potential to adversely affect the status of species which may be declining for other reasons.'
