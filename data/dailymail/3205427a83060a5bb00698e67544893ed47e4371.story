It is seen by some as a flaw. For others, an adorable facial feature. And for an increasing number of women all over the world, dimples are so desirable, they are willing to have surgery to achieve them.

'People like dimples, it's a unique group, a tremendous interest in it and we are surprised by the people who want to have dimples,' Dr Amiya Prasad, a New York-based cosmetic surgeon, tells Fox 10 news.

Dimpleplasty, as it's known, has been around for some 30 years, but it has gained popularity in recent times - thanks in part to dimple-cheeked celebrity icons like Kate Middleton - and is one of the more affordable cosmetic procedures available today.

Easy job: Dr Prasad, a New York-based cosmetic surgeon, performs this dimpleplasty in just half an hour, to give Lee Williams (center) the cherubic grin she's always longed for

At a cost of between $1,200 and $2,500, depending on the surgeon, the surgery takes only half an hour and is performed as an outpatient procedure. The incision is made inside the cheek, so there is no scar and, according to Dr Prasad, 'hardly any swelling or soreness.'

One of his patients, Lee Williams, spent a year considering it, before ultimately going under the scalpel, and for her, it's all about attaining more of a cherubic grin.

'I
 just want someone to perk me up a little bit, make me a little cuter, a
 little more of a remember-able smile,' she says. And sure enough, a 
quick snip and a few stitches later - she is the proud owner of set of 
unmistakable dimples.

Under the knife: Ms Williams says she wants the surgery to 'perk' her up, make her 'cuter' and give her a more memorable smile

The process involves first marking with a pen where her natural dimples would be, by measuring from the corner of her eye down to her cheek.

'There's kind of a sweet spot where the skin will naturally give us permission to fold in a little bit and look more natural,' explains Dr Prasad.

He points out that many of his patients with 'round faces' get the procedure done because of the more 'angular' appearance their face takes on as a result of the surgery - creating the illusion that they have lost weight.

Naturally occurring dimples, as in the case of Jennifer Garner (left) and Leighton Meester (right) are in fact a genetically inherited defect in the cheek muscles

Dimples occur in both sexes, can be one-sided or symmetrical, and are commonly inherited as a dominant genetic trait.

According to Dr Aharnov, a Californian-based dimpleplasty specialist, natural dimples are technically a flaw in the facial structure; 'formed when there is a small defect in the cheek musculature.'

Still, for the likes of Kate Middleton, Jennifer Garner and Miranda Kerr, to name a few, dimples are part of their winning charm.

Designer dimples could become designer disasters within a matter of years

But some surgeons are warning against the procedure.

A spokesman for plastic surgeons Surgicare stated two years ago: 'As the skin ages and loses elasticity, there is no telling how the scars will look as the face begins to droop.

'Designer dimples could become designer disasters within a matter of years.'

Which spells bad news for anyone who wishes to change their mind; as this latest celebrity-inspired trend in plastic surgery is not reversible.
