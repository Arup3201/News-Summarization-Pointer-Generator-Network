London's mayor Boris Johnson is famous for his ability to make people laugh but it would seem that he isn't the only Conservative politician with a ready sense of humour.

Home Secretary Theresa May also knows more than a thing or two about raising a smile - a talent she demonstrated for the benefit of a local police officer while waiting for the Queen outside a Berkshire school this morning.

According to onlookers, a smiling Mrs May chatted happily to a local policeman before treating him to a series of amusing facial expressions, among them a grimace and an eye-roll, and staring up at the heavens with a smile.

The entertainer: The Home Secretary treated a police officer to an amusing series of grimaces as she waited for the Queen to arrive

Sense of humour: Mrs May rolls her eyes towards the heavens - much to the delight of police officers and dignitaries

All smiles: The Home Secretary had stopped joking by the time the Queen arrived and swept her a curtsey instead

When the monarch arrived, Mrs May, who was resplendent in a grey tweed suit and a pair of her favourite leopard print kitten heels, opted for a big smile and a curtsey and put jokes aside as she accompanied the royal couple on a tour of free school, Holyport College.

The Queen herself was elegant in a pretty pale pink ensemble, complete with one of her trademark Launer handbags, and was all smiles as she was welcomed to the school by headmaster, Walter Boyle.

Joined by the Duke of Edinburgh, the Queen was treated to a tour of the school, including a peep at lessons, the science laboratory and one of the boarding houses.

Once inside, the Queen joked about the proliferation of satellite navigation ahead of old fashioned map reading after joining a group of students studying geography.

As the children crouched over maps following co-ordinates, the Queen watched intently and chatted to Josh Jacques, aged 11. He explained they had been set the task of finding a point on the map and the Queen joked: 'Nowadays you probably have a sat-nav or something'.

Nice to see you: Mrs May also showed off a pair of her trademark leopard print kitten heels and a neatly tailored tweed suit

Much better: Mrs May clearly enjoyed her encounter with the Queen and was left wreathed in smiles after the monarch moved away

Dutiful: The Duke of Edinburgh was on cheerful form but the Queen looked pensive as she prepared to meet Holyport students

Pretty: The Queen was ravishing in a pretty pale pink ensemble and accessorised the outfit with a triple string of pearls

One of the growing number of free schools, Holyport College is an all-ability, co-educational day and boarding school for students aged 11 to 19, which opened this September. 

Nearby Eton College, which counts the Duke of Cambridge and Prince Harry among alumni, is the new institution’s educational sponsor and has helped to shape the school in the years leading up to its opening by taking a leading role on its governing body.

Pupils are able to use some of the facilities at the world famous College, particularly for sports activities, and Eton students volunteer at Holyport helping their peers in a range of areas, especially with homework. The annual fees for children boarding at the school, 55 in total, are just over £11,000 a year.

During the visit the Duke of Edinburgh, who is known for his quips, could not resist making a joke about an elevator which slowly carried the royal couple to a first floor dormitory beeping as it went.

He said to laughter from senior college staff: 'How did you manage to get an antique lift into the building?' The Queen, meanwhile, chatted to a group of boys who told her their bedrooms were just along the corridor and she joked 'no excuses for being late'.

The visit comes hot on the heels of a row about private schools and the state sector, sparked by a column written by Labour's Shadow Education Secretary Tristram Hunt in which he threatened to strip the fee-paying sector of tax breaks worth £700m.

Writing in the Guardian, Mr Hunt, who is himself privately educated, said private schools have not done enough to support state establishments and must do more if they wish to keep the tax break.

'The next government will say to them: step up and play your part,' said Mr Hunt. 'Earn your keep. Because the time you could expect something for nothing is over.'

The resulting row saw independent schools and Conservative politicians hit back at Mr Hunt, who also opposes free schools, accusing him of fomenting class war and acting in a 'bigoted' manner.

Mark Beard, headteacher of Mr Hunt's old school the independent University College School, said Labour should be considering 'new, helpful initiatives' to raise standards in state schools instead of trying to 'tastelessly quantify' the value of public benefit his former school generates each year.

In a statement, Mr Beard said: 'If the shadow education secretary were to visit his old school, what would he find? A diverse pupil population from all creeds and backgrounds, with £1 million per annum granted for fee assistance, the vast majority for 100 per cent bursaries.

'Indeed, if Mr Hunt wanted to tastelessly quantify the value of public benefit that UCS generates each year then he would find that it far outstrips the value of tax relief that UCS receives through its charitable status.

'Rather than rely on independent schools to solve the issues for the 93 per cent of children who are educated in the state sector, isn't it time for Labour to come up with some new, helpful initiatives rather than espousing what some might deem an offensive bigotry?' 

Inspection: The Queen joined pupils for lessons as well as touring the dormitories and refectory

Can I join in? During this geography lesson, the Queen joked about the popularity of sat-nav and the decline of maps 

What's in there? The Queen peers through a microscope during a tour of the school's state-of-the-art science labs

Sporty: Pupils studying at Holyport can also use the sporting facilities at Eton, which sponsors the Berkshire free school

Well-wishers: The royal couple were greeted outside the school by a cheering crowd that included this adorable young well-wisher
