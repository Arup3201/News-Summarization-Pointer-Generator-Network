A last-minute decision led to a 21-year-old woman from Victoria taking out the coveted Fashions on the Field title at the Melbourne Cup Carnival.

Brodie Worell, from South Yarra, wore a full-skirted dress with a boat neck by Australian designer Toni Maticevski with black shoes, clutch gloves, and a monochrome feathered flower headpiece made by Melbourne milliner Felicity Northeast.

The 21-year-old said she was shocked by the win as she had just decided the Monday before Derby Day - when finalists were selected - she was going to attend.

The colour palette for Oaks Day called for floral frocks as well as equally colourful fascinators

Others opted for more muted colours like these two lovely ladies who went for navy blue and white, and cream and black

'I only picked up the hat Derby Day. [After I decided to go] I went down to Felicity and she pulled the veiling and flowers off another hat, and she hand cut every single feather on the flower,' Ms Worell told Daily Mail Australia.

'We worked together and put the hat together. She was amazing. I couldn't have done it without her.'

The inspiration for Ms Worell's outfit came from her own mother and Audrey Hepburn.

' I loved Audrey Hepburn. It was just that classic style, and black and white is always beautiful for Melbourne,' she said.

'[With Mum], I always loved watching her put the gloves on, the veiling and the hat, so I've taken little bits.

'I did the veiling in my hat but wired veiling for a modern look.'

It may be a day for ladies but the blokes scrub up alright as well alongside their dates

Oaks Day is also known as Ladies Day. The featured race for the day is the Oaks, which is run at 5pm AEDT

The day is a stark contrast to Saturday's Derby Day when black and white is traditionally worn

It would have been fierce competition at this year's Fashions on the Field during Oaks Day

Ms Worell said she was not only thrilled to win Fashions on the Field at Flemington Racecourse but just being a named a finalist on Derby Day was enough.

' I've only really started doing Fashions these past couple of years so to get to the top ten on Derby Day, I was beside myself,' she said.

'I didn't take my Derby Day sash off all week.'

One of the prizes Ms Worell gets to take home is a Lexus car, which she and her boyfriend, James, who could not wait to drive.

'[To celebrate], I might just go sit in my Lexus I think,' she said.

Ms Worell's musician boyfriend was glowing with pride for his partner.

'I'm shocked and so proud of her. Most beautiful I've ever seen her,' he told Daily Mail Australia.

Thinking outside the box, this punter decided to wear pants instead of a frock to the race day on Thursday

There was no shortage of dramatic headwear to wow the crowds at Flemington Racecourse on Thursday

First and second runner-up for Fashions on the Field were Western Australia's Nikki Gogan and Shannen Dennet, from New South Wales respectively.

The Fashion on the Field contestants made up the 60,000-strong crowd who came through the gates at the racing track on Thursday.

Though some opted to wear black, there were flashes of bright yellows, deep blues and eye-popping fuschias to contrast against the green grasses of the track side, giving even the most glamorous of celebrities a run for their money.

The featured event of the day is the Oaks which is run at 5pm AEDT, with a prize of $1 million up for grabs for the winner.

It is the third of the carnival before the last day of the four-day event, the Emirates Stakes Day, on Saturday.
