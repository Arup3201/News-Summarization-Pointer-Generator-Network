A prostitute has claimed that former International Monetary Fund chief Dominique Strauss-Kahn tried to get her a visa to work in the USA, it has emerged.

The revelation came as the 62-year-old was released from custody in Lille, northern France, after two days of questioning about an illegal vice ring based in the city.

Strauss-Kahn is facing charges of 'complicity in pimping' and 'misuse of corporate assets' - crimes which could see him locked up for a total of 12 years.

Judges have already charged a number of men with organising orgies, and a building company executive is accused of using its money to entertain guests at sex parties held in cities around the world, including Paris and Washington DC.

Strauss-Kahn admits attending many of the parties - but claims he did not know the girls were prostitutes because they were 'all naked at the time'.

Now it has emerged that one of the women involved claims she flew to Washington DC when Strauss-Kahn was IMF chief.

'There Strauss-Kahn is said to have tried to get her a visa for her to remain in the USA,' said a legal source close to the case.

'This would have huge ramifications on Strauss-Kahn's defence as it would prove he was assisting a prostitute in her work - something which is illegal in France.

'The allegation that an IMF chief was trying to get visas for prostitutes would also create a huge scandal.'

The woman, who has not been named, is said to have documentary evidence, including pictures of her with Strauss-Kahn.

Phone records suggest Strauss-Kahn was in contact with at least 10 call girls.

All of the women, who are mainly French and Belgians from immigrant backgrounds, claim to have had paid sex with him while he was IMF chief.

But Strauss-Kahn's lawyer, Henri Leclerc, said his client was 'totally unaware' that the women were receiving cash.

'At these parties, people were not necessarily dressed, and I defy you to tell the difference between a naked prostitute and any other naked woman,' said Mr Leclerc.

Strauss-Kahn's night in a 10ft by 12ft police cell in Lille was his seventh in custody in the past year - but all the rest were spent in the USA where he faced an allegation of attempted rape.

While in America Strauss-Kahn complained about having to wear handcuffs, and his humiliation in France also looked likely to lead to protests from his lawyers.

Alleged victim: New York chambermaid Nafissatou Diallo

His stark cell contained a four inch high foam mattress, a hole-in-the-floor toilet, and an observance window which allowed a police officer to watch him constantly.

Strauss-Kahn admits taking part in orgies and said he had an 'uninhibited sex life', but that he 'never paid a centime' for it. 'I have a horror of prostitutes and pimping,' he said.

Judicial officials say he will be summoned again next month by three judges who will decide if there is enough evidence to file charges in a case focusing on the alleged prostitution ring in France and Belgium.

Strauss-Kahn, a leading member of the French Socialist Party who wanted to run for President this year, resigned from the IMF last May after being accused of raping Nafissatou Diallo, a 32-year-old chambermaid in a New York hotel.

The US case collapsed, but when he returned to France Tristane Banon, a 32-year-old writer, accused him of attempting to rape her.

Prosecutors found prima facie evidence of sexual assault, but said the alleged attack - which happened in 2003 - was too old to pursue.

Now Strauss-Kahn is at the centre of an entirely separate investigation into the prostitution ring which operated out of Lille's upmarket Carlton Hotel.

Allegations include that he paid a 
30-year-old escort between €500 to €1,000 to sleep with him 11 times, as
he 'had sex with escort girls at libertine parties financed by French 
businessmen'.

Another 
prostitute was allegedly given a guided tour of the International 
Monetary Fund headquarters in Washington after an evening in his 
company. Hookers are also said to have been flown out to Washington to 
entertain him.

Strauss-Kahn, who is still facing a civil suit from the New York chamber maid, is said to have attended a number of the parties.

The last one he attended was in Washington in May, just before he was accused of attempted rape by Ms Diallo.

Prostitution is legal in France for women over 18, but acting as a pimp - or somebody who controls prostitutes and makes money out of them - is.

There is also a suggestion that some of the girls involved in the Carlton ring may have been underage.

Strauss-Kahn has been keeping a low profile since returning from the U.S.A., living quietly in Paris with his wife, Anne Sinclair.

Ms Sinclair, a former TV presenter who now runs a news website in the French capital, has caused astonishment by staying with her husband, despite him admitting to numerous affairs.
