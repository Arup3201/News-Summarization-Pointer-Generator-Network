A trainee hairdresser was hit and killed by a double decker bus as he fled a Lidl supermarket after being allegedly 'dared' by friends to shoplift a bottle of water.

Charleigh Etherington, 16, also known as Charlie, was knocked down outside the budget supermarket in Greenwich, south east London, on Friday evening.

The trainee hairdresser became trapped beneath the vehicle and was pronounced dead at the scene on Halloween night at about 5pm despite efforts by paramedics to revive him.

Charleigh Etherington was staying with his grandmother and planned to leave London the day before his death

Witnesses reported he had been with friends and was seen fleeing the supermarket into busy Eynsham Drive, Abbey Wood, with a security guard in pursuit.

But Charleigh's grandfather, Del Etherington, who arrived at the scene 'minutes' after the accident, said he was told the young student had paid for the bottle of water he was carrying.

'A lot of people were saying there was a receipt in the bag.

'One man said they ran out laughing. They were just larking about, mucking around like kids do … and he ran out of the shop and look what happened.'

'It was fate. He was staying up with his nan's (in Greenwich) for a couple of days and he said he was going to go home back to his mother the night before. Then he stayed.'

'He was a lovely kid.

'He was gay and had been bullied to death his whole life. My daughter (Aisha) had moved him away from London, and he comes back for a couple of days and this happens.'

Charleigh lived with his mother Aisha Etherington, Del's daughter, and younger brother Alfie, 12, an hour outside London.

Charleigh ran from this Lidl shop in Eynsham Drive, Abbey Wood, before colliding with a double decker

'She's in bits, she's absolutely heartbroken. She adored her kids. They're all upset. There's no words to describe how we all feel.' Charleigh's father, Mark, lives in Herne Bay in Kent.

Del, who is from Woolwich, recalled how he arrived at the scene of the accident at Eynsham Drive, Abbey Wood, shortly after Charleigh was hit by the double decker.

'I got a call and was literally there five minutes after. When I got there they were still trying to get him out in time.

'He hit the windscreen. It threw him back and he went under the bus.'

Paramedics pronounced Charleigh dead at the scene minutes later, Del said. Charleigh's father Mark arrived within an hour after police 'rushed him' from his Herne Bay home.

Charleigh's uncle, Richard Etherington, said he lamented for the driver of the double decker.

'I feel sorry for the poor man – it's not a very nice thing to see. He's going to have to live with that for the rest of his life.'

A post-mortem has already been carried out on Charleigh's body, Del said, and his mother Aisha will identify his body tomorrow.

'Can you imagine what it's going to be like then – it'll be hell for us all.'

Charleigh had been studying hairdressing at Canterbury College. Del said: 'He was really enjoying it, doing very well and he'd only two more years of the course to do.'

Del added: 'It's not right for someone to go at that age, it should be someone like me who's had a long life.'

Floral tributes have been left for Charleigh at the scene of the accident. 'There's thousands of flowers down there,' Del said. 'He was such a fun lad, he was typically flamboyant.

'It's going to be a huge funeral. He was very popular.'

Lidl said it could not comment on the circumstances surrounding the accident because of the police involvement.

The Metropolitan Police said no arrest was made at the scene.

A spokesman said: 'Police were called to Eynsham Drive, Abbey Wood, at approximately 5.10pm on Friday, 31 October, to reports of a double decker bus in collision with a male pedestrian.

'Officers and London Ambulance Service attended. The pedestrian, a 16-year-old boy, was pronounced dead at the scene.

'Next of kin have been informed, however officers await formal identification. A post-mortem examination will be held in due course.

'Officers from the Serious Collision Investigation Unit based at Catford are investigating. Enquiries continue to establish the full circumstances of the incident.

'There has been no arrest.'
