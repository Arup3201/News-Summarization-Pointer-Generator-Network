Demanding urgent action: Lord Hurd (pictured) said the issue has 'dragged on beyond questions of mere negligence and forgivable delay'

Delays in publishing the findings of the Chilcot inquiry into the Iraq war are a scandal, peers were told last night.

Demanding urgent action, Lord Hurd said the issue had ‘dragged on beyond questions of mere negligence and forgivable delay’.

‘It is becoming a scandal,’ said the peer, who as Douglas Hurd was foreign secretary from 1989 to 1995.

‘This is not a matter of trivial importance; it is something to which a large number of people in this country look anxiously for the truth,’ he told Parliament.

‘Is it not time the Government exerted themselves to make sure that reasonable demand is met?’

Lord Dykes – a former Tory minister and now Lib Dem peer – said the delay in a process that started more than five years ago was ‘an utter and total disgrace’.

He added: ‘More and more people think that it is some kind of attempt to prolong the agony for Tony Blair facing possible war crimes charges.’

Lord Wallace, a Lib Dem minister, told peers yesterday the report may now not be published until after the election in May.

He suggested the wait was the result of telling subjects of the report – including Mr Blair and Jack Straw – about its conclusions and allowing them to respond.

This so-called ‘Maxwellisation’ process means anyone who faces criticism by a public inquiry must be sent a letter warning them of the contents so they can challenge any negative findings.

The procedure takes its name from a court challenge by media tycoon Robert Maxwell who overturned the verdict of a critical report in 1969.

Lord Wallace said if the report was not released by the end of next month there would be no time to debate it properly before Parliament is dissolved in March for the election.

‘It is up to the inquiry and its chairman to decide when the process is complete,’ he added.

‘Maxwellisation is part of the process of completing the report. When it is complete, it will be published.’

In November, the Mail revealed letters had been sent to the main participants. Lord Wallace said the process of deciding what classified and sensitive material could be published has been completed.

These documents include letters between Mr Blair and George W Bush in the run-up to the war.

They will expose what assurances the former prime minister gave the US president about Britain’s involvement.

The report will contain more than a million words and ‘publish substantial documentation from more than 200 Cabinet meetings’, according to Lord Wallace.

A spokesman for the Chilcot Inquiry said the aim was to submit the report ‘as soon as possible’. David Cameron must decide when to make it public.

Former leaders: Earlier this year there were claims of a whitewash after Sir John confirmed his report would publish only 'the gist' and some quotes of Tony Blair’s (right) messages to George W Bush (left)

In May last year the Prime Minister said he expected it to be released ‘before the end of the year’.

Launched by Gordon Brown in July 2009, the inquiry began its hearings four months later under Sir John Chilcot and finished taking formal evidence in 2011.

Earlier this year there were claims of a whitewash after Sir John confirmed his report would publish only ‘the gist’ and some quotes of Mr Blair’s messages to Mr Bush. The US president’s replies will not be published.

Families of servicemen killed in Iraq condemned the decision not to publish the documents in full, saying they might never learn the full truth about the decision to go to war.

Mr Blair insists he is not the reason for the delay and has said the ‘sooner the report is published the better’.
