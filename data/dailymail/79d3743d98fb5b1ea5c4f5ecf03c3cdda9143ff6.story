Andy Murray practised under the scorching Melbourne sun on Saturday - but the British No 1 will be playing under the lights on Sunday.

Murray's last-16 clash against Wimbledon conqueror Grigor Dimitrov has been scheduled as the second match on Rod Laver Arena on Sunday night at around 8:30pm (9:30am UK time).

And sixth seed Murray prepared for the blockbuster match with a practice session lasting just over an hour as the temperature reached 30 degrees on the outside courts of Melbourne Park.

Sunday's match against Dimitrov, the No 10 seed, gives Murray the chance for revenge in their first Grand Slam meeting since the Bulgarian beat the then-defending Wimbledon champion in the quarter-finals at the All England Club last July.

Murray has been in fine form so far Down Under, winning nine of nine sets played so far, and has also received a boost with 17-time Grand Slam champion Roger Federer being removed from his quarter of the draw on Friday.

Sunday will be Murray's first appearance on the main show court in Melbourne since losing to Federer in the quarter-finals last year.

And Dimitrov admitted he expects to face a completely different Murray than the man he beat at Wimbledo.

'That day it was not him out there on the court. I think we all know that. I think it's a different scenario this time,' he said, who twice came from a set down to beat Marcos Baghdatis in five sets in the third round.

'It just happened for me on that day to really play good. I used every single mistake that he did. I'm sure in the next round he's going to be really focused and composed and wants to do everything to stop me.

'I think he has a lot to look forward to. I think adding up the new (coaching) team, I think it's all fresh. I think it's going to give him a bit more excitement to compete, which I'm certainly aware of.

'But at the same time, I feel that I'm pretty stable around me as well. I think the only thing I can do is get out there and play my tennis.

'It's a great match-up for me. I'm always excited to play against him. I always like that kind of challenge. I think physically and mentally I'm ready to play that match and really give 100 per cent.

'We always had good battles. We know how we play, so there's no secrets out on the court, which in a way is nice to have. At least you know what to expect. I think it's going to come down to those kind of little moments that we can use.'

Murray has yet to drop a set in Melbourne and needed just over two hours to beat Portugal's Joao Sousa 6-1 6-1 7-5 in the third round.

'It will be a tough match (against Dimitrov) obviously,' said Murray, who won his last match against Dimitrov in the Paris Masters last year. 'He's played well in the slams the last year or so.

'He's obviously a talented player. He's one of the young guys trying to make a breakthrough, so he'll be motivated. Hopefully I can play a good match and make it tough for him.'
