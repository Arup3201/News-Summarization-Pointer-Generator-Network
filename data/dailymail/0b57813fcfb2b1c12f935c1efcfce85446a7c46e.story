The final moments of a gunman's day before murdering a star surgeon at Boston's Brigham Women's Hospital have been detailed in a chilling new profile the reveals how the man's sanity was consumed by a plot for revenge. 

Cardiovascular surgeon Dr. Michael Davidson, 44, from Wellesley, Massachusetts, was shot by Stephen Pasceri, 55, on the morning of Tuesday, January 20, and passed away late that evening. 

Pasceri's relatives suggested that he was angry over the death of his mother, whom Dr Davidson had treated.

Now a lengthy investigation at The Boston Globe has taken readers inside Pasceri's life and final hours. 

He had left his Millbury home telling his wife he was on his way to work at the Waters Corporation, despite calling in sick to his accountant job.

He left behind a thumb drive with his last thoughts to be sent to his brother. 

Pasceri has become obsessed with the idea that his mother, Marguerite Pasceri, 78, was killed by a post-operative drug prescribed by Davidson.

He death certificate lists the official cause as 'cardiovascular collapse.'

Referencing Pslams in his final thoughts, Pasceri wrote: 'The doctor is dead. I am dead. There is nothing more anyone can do.'

Davidson left behind his wife, who is a plastic surgeon, and their three other children, two girls aged seven and nine and a two-year-old son, his father-in-law told the Boston Herald.

It later emerged the couple was expecting their fourth child.

Pasceri wandered the hospital for an hour before coming upon the doctor and firing. 

Security footage shows him calmly strolling by gift shops and the cardiovascular clinic.

Though Pasceri was known as a husband and father, a man who regularly attended church and even started a men's group to help with home repair projects, those close to him said there had long been a dark side.  

'Really deep down, inside, he must have known that he was wrong for some of the things he did,' sister, Marguerite Joly, told the Globe. 'I think he slowly lost his mind.'

Brother John Pasceri did not think mental illness was a factor but agreed that Pasceri could be unforgiving. 

'When you were wrong, you had to suffer the judgments of Steve,' he told reporters.

A man with a troubled past, he had been arrested at 17 for stealing guns from a neighbor's house.

But his mother got a good lawyer who cut a deal for counseling and military service, and he spent three years in the Army until finally coming home in December 1980.

It was that dark side that emerged at the hospital when he approached secretary Cheryl Cantalupo demanding to see Davidson without an appointment. 

'No, you don’t understand,' he said. 'I’ve traveled a long way. I have to see Dr. Davidson. I’m not leaving without seeing him.'

Finally, Pasceri was taken back to Exam Room 15.

Davidson was later reported to have remarked on the way to the meeting: 'Watch this, he’ll probably shoot me.'

After what witnesses described as a long, repetitive argument over the effects of the drug Pasceri blamed for his mother's death, the bereaved son pulled out a gun.

Davidson was hit first in the left hp, then in the back as he spun and reached for the door. 

His last moments were spent warning others.

'Run, run, he’s shooting, he’s shooting!' he was said to have cried out as he ran from the exam room. 

After shooting the surgeon, Pasceri went into another room and shot himself.

Boston Police Commissioner William Evans said officers conducting a room-by-room search found the gunman dead in an exam room with the weapon.

Later, four of Davidson's colleagues paid tribute to him during a news conference at the hospital, and remembered him as 'almost always the smartest man in the room'.

Blame game: Marguerite E. (Olofson) Pasceri passed away on November 15, 2014 and it is thought that her son and executor, Stephen Pasceri blamed Dr. Davidson at Brigham and Women's Hospital for her passing

'You all should be absolutely assured that Michael Davidson was one of the kindest, best possible men that ever walked on this earth,' colleague Dr. Andrew Eisenhauer said, ABC News reported. 'We knew that and his patients knew that and his family knows that.'

His colleagues also recalled his 'silly side' and how he played guitar in a band with other doctors from the hospital.   

Dr Davidson's heartbroken father-in-law told the Herald how Dr Davidson had yelled for patients and staff to flee before he was shot.

'He was a hero - he told everybody to get out,' he said. 'He started yelling, "Get out. Get out." He knew it was coming.'

He recalled how much he cared for his patients, and added: 'He loved his family. He loved his kids. He loved my daughter to death.'

A fund has been set up for the family here. 

Pasceri, who was licensed to carry a firearm, may have also been holding a vendetta because of the health care his father Greg received during a fatal hear attack in December 2011.

The Worcester Telegram reported that in 2012, Pasceri became so furious that his mother had been left with a $8,000 medical bill, he wrote to Senator John Kerry and US Rep. James McGovern to demand an investigation.

However, the newspaper noted that the Pasceri family had no issue with the level of care received by their father at Massachusetts General Hospital.

Pasceri's sister said she was stunned that her brother had attacked the doctor. 

Heartbroken: Administrators and staff at a leading Boston hospital mourned the death of  Davidson

Sadness: The hospital's logo flag was lowered to half-staff during a Wednesday ceremony to honor Davidson

Boston Mayor Martin J. Walsh said he was 'deeply saddened' by Davidson's death. 'This tragedy is the result of a senseless act of violence that has no place in our City,' he said in a statement early Wednesday

'Everything seemed to be going really well. I have no idea why he snapped like this,' said Marguerite Jolym, according to the Boston Herald.

According to Joly, her brother 'deeply loved' his mother and said her 'warm, compassionate, generous and understanding personality was a gift and example to the world'. 

'I think it comes down to the fact that my brother thought it was the doctor's fault that my mother died,' Joly said. 'I don't know why my brother would blame him. I really don't know why.'

'We can't even wrap our brains around this,' Marguerite Joly said. 'There was no indication whatsoever that he would ever do anything like this... All his ducks were in a row,' she said. 'This was not a bad, evil man. Something happened, and I don't know what.'

In the aftermath of Dr. Davidson's death, staff at Brigham and women's entered into a period of mourning according to NECN. 

Hospital officials  lowered a flag outside the hospital to half-staff in honor of Davidson.

'Dr. Davidson was a wonderful and inspiring cardiac surgeon who devoted his career to saving lives and improving the quality of life of every patient he cared for,' said a statement issued by the hospital, which is affiliated with Harvard Medical School. 

'It is truly devastating that his own life was taken in this horrible manner.'  

Boston Mayor Martin J. Walsh said he was 'deeply saddened' by Davidson's death.

'This tragedy is the result of a senseless act of violence that has no place in our City,' he said in a statement early Wednesday.

Shortly after the shooting, one witness said that the Shapiro building had been placed on lockdown and dozens of emergency vehicles had arrived on the scene.

'Once we were clear of the waiting room, there were police officers with their weapons drawn yelling, 'Get down! Get down,'' said one man to WCVB.

Hospital employees are well-drilled for the nightmare scenario of a shooter inside the building.

In November 2013, doctors and nurses and other staff at the world-famous institution underwent training for an active shooter situation and viewed a video for a so-called 'Code Silver' event.

'I am extremely proud of the way our staff responded,' said hospital president Dr. Elizabeth Nabel according to the Boston Globe.  

Boston police had at one stage mistakenly tweeted that Pasceri had been apprehended and was in custody.  

Boston Police Commissioner William Evans said that because the doctor was surrounded by colleagues medical help was administered immediately.

'We are looking at a possible motive. We know (the gunman) came into the hospital on the second floor looking for this particular doctor. There was a reason he targeted this doctor,' Evans said according to WMUR.Com.

'Our prayers go out to the doctor's wife,' Evans said.
