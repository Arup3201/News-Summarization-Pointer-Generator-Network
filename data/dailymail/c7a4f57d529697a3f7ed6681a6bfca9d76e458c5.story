Nafees Hamid made sexual remarks to alleged victims and removed their clothes himself, a court heard

A respected neurosurgeon sexually assaulted ten of his female patients before falsifying their medical records to ‘cover his tracks’, a court heard yesterday.

Nafees Hamid, 50, is accused of groping the women, aged between 22 and 66, during medical examinations, often while making lewd sexual remarks.

Hamid was aroused while he made the ‘intimate examinations’, Birmingham Crown Court heard.

A jury was told he would either ask the women to remove their clothes, or on some occasions remove them himself without warning.

He would then touch them inappropriately and repeatedly, sometimes for prolonged periods and without wearing surgical gloves, the court heard.

Some of the alleged victims were also complimented on their physical appearance and asked invasive questions about their sexual history. According to neurosurgeon Patrick Stratham, the doctor had no reason to carry out such medical examinations and most women were experiencing unrelated problems with their necks and spines.

Hamid, who worked at Birmingham’s Queen Elizabeth Hospital and the city’s private Priory clinic for more than a decade, denies 14 counts of sexual assault between May 2009 and June last year.

Jonas Hankin, QC, prosecuting, told the court: ‘Nafees Hamid was a consultant in neurosurgery who dealt with disorders affecting the skull, spine and nervous system.

‘It is the prosecution’s case that he performed unnecessary and medically unjustifiable intimate examinations on each of the ten women.

‘He ignored General Medical Council guidelines about intimate examinations and failed to record the examination’s findings in case records so as to cover his tracks.

‘His purpose in touching the private parts of these women was not medical but sexual.

‘In failing to observe the first rule of medicine, to do no harm, he betrayed the trust of his patients and his fellow professionals.’ He said that Hamid often ‘avoided having a chaperone’, which any patient can legally ask for during medical examinations.

One patient, who was the first to report the alleged crimes last November, told officers that he had asked her to lie on a bed then, when she looked away, he undid the button and zip on her skirt.

‘The patient had been to see the surgeon with back and urinary problems,’ said Mr Hankin, who added that she told police Hamid had touched her intimately.

The court heard she was ‘left frozen to the spot’ before he told her ‘you are a sweet girl’. The alleged victim then ran outside the hospital and ‘burst into tears’.

The ordeal left her feeling ashamed and embarrassed,’ Mr Hankin said. ‘An expert says these examinations should have been done by a specialist gynaecologist, not a neurosurgeon.’

The jury was told about another patient, a 42-year-old woman whom he saw on several occasions who had a neck injury and resulting urinary incontinence. 

Mr Hankin said: ‘He told her she had a “beautiful body”, asked her when she had orgasms, if she masturbated and then asked her to show him how.

‘The examination was entirely inappropriate as her problem was in the neck.

‘Eventually he told her he could no longer care for her as he had developed feelings for her.’

The alleged assaults at The Priory (pictured) and Queen Elizabeth hospitals are alleged to have taken place between May 2009 and June 2013

 The court heard Hamid, of Moseley, Birmingham, trained in Pakistan and moved to Britain in 2000.

After the first patient reported him and a criminal investigation began, a letter was sent to all of Hamid’s female patients saying an unnamed doctor had been accused of misconduct. This is when his other victims came forward.

Mr Hankin said: ‘He will argue that in some cases what he did was medically justified and that in others that allegations are incorrect, that the assaults never happened.

‘The fact that these women reported what had happened separately makes it legitimate and not the result of malicious intention.’

The trial continues.
