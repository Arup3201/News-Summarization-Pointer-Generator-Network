Controversial Queens Park Rangers footballer Joey Barton was burgled as he celebrated his son’s first birthday, it emerged today.

The £80,000-a-week midfielder, who is currently on loan at Olympique Marseille in France’s Ligue 1, was hosting an animal-themed party for his son Cassius near the home of his partner’s mother.

Barton, 30, and his partner Georgia McNeil, 25, were staying at the house of Denise McNeil, 52, in West Derby, Liverpool, for Christmas - but the thieves struck while the home was empty.

They smashed windows to gain entry on the night of last Friday and broke Cassius’s toys he had just received for Christmas while they hunted for jewellery and money, reported The Sun.

The burglars got away with a family safe and were said to be confident the act would go without a hitch because Barton was tweeting pictures from the party around 15 minutes’ drive away.

‘Joey had been staying over Christmas and it’s likely the thieves knew he was there,’ a source told the Sun last night. ‘He was tweeting pictures from the party while the robbery was in progress.’

Barton tweeted at 2:24pm last Friday: 'Littleman's 1st birthday today. That year has flown. Happy 30th to @taggerdutaggerr (Andy Taylor) as well. Made up your business partners coming to c u!’

He later posted two pictures at 6:56pm, with one showing a picture of three men wearing animal fancy dress - and another of a blue birthday cake for Cassius with a lion and two monkeys on top.

More than a third of Britons have publicised that their property is empty by sharing their whereabouts on social media, a survey said.

And almost 30 per cent of people regularly leave their home unsecured while popping out - with windows open and doors unlocked, the poll by insurers Quotemehappy.com revealed. 

Meanwhile more than three quarters of people in Britain regularly leave their property vacant without an active burglar alarm, it found.

The company's trading director Henry Topham: ‘Many homeowners are leaving tell-tale signs that they’re away and their house is empty, making it even easier for burglars to strike.’

A Merseyside Police spokesman said today: ‘We can confirm we had a report of burglary in the early hours of the 29th of December. Nobody was in at the time.

‘It would appear that a safe containing jewellery, documents and cash was stolen. The only damage to the house that we could see was caused by it being broken into and there is no indication of any other damage.’

Barton has not yet commented on the burglary, but said on Twitter on New Year's Eve: 'Got to stop as my son is now starting to copy things/noises people say. #nomoreswearing'

Marseille currently sit third in Ligue 1, and Barton has played 12 games on loan from the Premier League side - seven of which were in the league - scoring one goal and accumulating three yellow cards.

Last week it was revealed he could stay 
at the French side for longer than his 12-month loan as it is understood
QPR chiefs have encouraged him to terminate his contract by mutual 
consent.

Prolific tweeter: Barton mentioned that it was his son's first birthday on the afternoon of last Friday

Barton, a former Manchester City and Newcastle United player, arrived at Marseille last August after being banned for 12 matches in May for violent conduct when he was sent off in a fiery match.

The player - also fined £75,000 by the Football Association - elbowed Manchester City player Carlos Tevez, kicked Sergio Aguero and then aimed a head-butt at Vincent Kompany in disgraceful scenes.

Barton admitted last November that the money on offer at QPR persuaded him to join in August 2011, saying: ‘I did it because my partner was due to give birth - but I did not feel good about it.’

He developed a track record of violent 
conduct after inciting a 10-man brawl when Manchester City faced 
Doncaster Rovers in a pre-season friendly in July 2004 following a bad 
challenge on a player.

In December 2004 he stubbed a lit cigar into the eye of a City player at the club’s Christmas party and was sent home from a pre-season tour of Thailand in June 2005 after a brawl in the team hotel.

In May 2007 he assaulted another City teammate during training and in December 2007 attacked a 16-year-old boy near a Liverpool McDonald's after binge-drinking. He was later jailed for six months.

But on a lighter note, he was ridiculed last November for conducting an interview in English with a bizarre French accent reminiscent of 'Allo 'Allo! after making his loan league debut for Marseille.

Barton said on Twitter yesterday  that he was returning to France after his Christmas break in Britain.
