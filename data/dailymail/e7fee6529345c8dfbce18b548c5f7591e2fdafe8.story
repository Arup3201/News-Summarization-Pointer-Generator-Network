Alexander Perepilichnyy who was found dead near his £3million mansion in Weybridge, Surrey

The death of a Russian supergrass who was a key witness in a multi-million pound international fraud investigation is not suspicious, police said today.

Alexander Perepilichnyy, 44, was found collapsed outside his home in Granville Road, Weybridge, Surrey, on November 10 last year sparking a major police investigation over fears he had been poisoned.

At the time of his death, Mr Perepilichnyy was involved in a fraud case involving the theft of around £140m in tax revenue from the Russian government.

Surrey Police said the matter has now been formally passed to the coroner and an inquest will be held after detectives found no evidence of foul play.

This was despite two post-mortem examinations carried out in November failing to establish a cause of death.

Toxicology samples were also taken from both post mortems but the results have not been released.

Senior investigating officer detective chief inspector Ian Pollard, from the Surrey and Sussex Major Crime Team, said: 'I am satisfied that following extensive inquiries, including a post-mortem examination carried out by a Home Office pathologist, and a full and detailed range of toxicology tests, there is no evidence to suggest that there was any third party involvement in Mr Perepilichnyy's death.'

'I appreciate that there has been some
frustration around the length of time required to complete our 
inquiries, however my priority as the senior investigating officer for 
this investigation has always been to his family and to HM coroner for 
Surrey.

'Although the results of the toxicology tests are now known, the 
circumstances around Mr Perepilichnyy's death will now be the subject of
an inquest.'

Mr Pollard added: 'This was a tragic 
and sudden death which attracted intense media speculation. Mr 
Perepilichnyy's family has had to endure this media attention at the 
same time as coping with the loss of a loved one, and our thoughts 
remain with them at this time.'

Mr Perepilichnyy was helping Swiss 
authorities over the alleged fraud when he died. He had lived in the UK 
for three years and was believed to be in good health.

One theory was that he could have been
poisoned in a similar fashion to Alexander Litvinenko, the former KGB 
agent who died in London in 2006 after being contaminated with 
radioactive Polonium 210.
