Families are facing record fare rises as airlines begin to pass on increasing fuel costs and soaring taxes.

The warning comes just days after Ryanair announced a 12 per cent hike on ticket prices.

Experts believe it is 'inevitable' other airlines will follow suit.

Price hikes: A double double whammy of fuel price hikes and soaring taxes has led to budget carrier Ryanair announcing a 12 per cent rise in ticket prices

The increase would see £300 added to a holiday in Florida for a family of four, or nearly £100 for the same family flying to Spain.

EasyJet chief executive Carolyn McCall warned that families'  foreign holidays were being hammered by the Government and would soon become a luxury only the privileged could enjoy.

She said: 'This is unfair on hard-working families. Britain is one of the only European countries to tax air passengers.'

There was a limit to how far even low-cost airlines could keep cutting costs against a background of high oil prices and taxes, she added. 'I think fares will rise inevitably because you have to pass on the cost of  fuel some way. All airlines will have to do it. All prices will rise.'

British Airways boss Willie Walsh said fuel costs had shot up by 35 per cent and the company's fuel bill this year would be £4.47billion – a third of its total costs.

Of a return ticket to Orlando in Florida costing £600, £340 is basic fare and £260 is made up of  fuel (£170), air passenger duty (£70) and local taxes. A 12 per cent fare hike could see the fare rise by £72 – or by £288 for a family of four.

Passengers face a second round of price increases from 2012 when the controversial air passenger duty (APD) is set to increase by double the rate of inflation. An announcement is expected in the pre-Budget statement in November.

A new 'green' emissions tax is also expected to be imposed from January. Details are yet to be finalised.

APD was first imposed on flights in November 1994, ranging from £5 for economy across Europe and £20 across the rest of the world, up to a maximum of £40 in other classes.

But since then it has soared – under the pretence of being a 'green' environmental tax –  so that now it ranges from £12 economy in Europe up to £85 for long-distance economy  journeys in the rest of the world, and £170 for the longest journeys in other classes.

Travel expert Bob Atkinson of travelsupermarket.com said:  'British families are undoubtedly facing  pressure on the amounts they pay for their air fares.

'If Ryanair is putting up prices by 12 per cent, others will not be far behind. It means that more than ever, families will have to shop around for the best deals.'
