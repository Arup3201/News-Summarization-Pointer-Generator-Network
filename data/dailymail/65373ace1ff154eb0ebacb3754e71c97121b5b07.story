Tim Howard already has Champions League ambitions for Everton and says the club should aim for no less than silverware as they prepare for a return to the Europa League under Roberto Martinez. 

The Toffees' fifth place finish with a record 72 points earned the side automatic passage into European club football's second tier and after Friday's draw, a place in group H with Lille, Wolfsburg and Krasnodar.

Now the US keeper, lauded as a hero in his home country after the World Cup in Brazil, says his club side has no choice but to be ambitious.

'We're in Europe again, so that will be good to have those big nights at Goodison but I think ultimately, at the end of the season we have to be lifting a trophy, I think that's important,' Howard said during a photo shoot with Nike's Ordem ball.

'Which one that is, it's difficult to say in August, but certainly that's the aim and the focus and we have a big enough squad to cope with the demands of Europe, different cup competitions and most importantly the Premier League.'

Everton has opened the Premier League season with two disappointing 2-2 draws against promoted Leicester and Arsenal, who ended last season one place ahead of them.

In both matches Howard's side were 2-1 up going into the closing moments only 80th and 90th-minute equalisers turning three points into one.

Still, Howard is certain he is the last line of defence for a stronger side than the one which impressed many last year.

Romelu Lukaku, on loan from Chelsea at Goodison last year, is now a permanent fixture while the arrival of Samuel Eto'o also from the west London giants adds even more quality in the final third.

Howard continues: 'Outside of that, we want to get into the Champions League - we think that we can do that, we were just short of that last year but again as I said we're stronger this season so we feel like we can do it.'

First they need to turn draws into wins though and their next hurdle could hardly be tougher as they host Chelsea at Goodison Park on Saturday. 

If fit, Eto'o could debut immediately against his old club while Lukaku is also in some doubt with injury.
