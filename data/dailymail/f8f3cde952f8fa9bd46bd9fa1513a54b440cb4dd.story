A new book to be released by Dave Berg, longtime producer for 'The Tonight Show with Jay Leno,' is pulling no punches in revealing the most memorable hijinks and celebrity diva moments from the show's history.

'The Tonight Show with Jay Leno', which began airing on NBC in 1992, hosted some of the hottest names of Hollywood and current events of the time.

The number one late-night talk show for most of its run, Jay Leno's show was the source of numerous pieces of pop-culture history, including Hugh Grant's 1995 public apology for his arrest with a prostitute, Arnold Schwarzenegger's announcement in 2003 that he would be running for Governor of California, and the 2009 appearance of Barack Obama, the first late night talk show appearance by a U.S. President.

Berg's new book, 'Behind the Curtain: An Insider’s View of Jay Leno’s Tonight Show', hits shelves on Sunday. The book offers an exclusive look into the history of the show, including which guests were tough to interview or hard to deal with.

For starters, the book confirms what most already know: That Christian Bale can be difficult to get along with. In 2002, Bale was scheduled to be a guest on the show, but clashed with Berg in a pre-show interview.

'I had asked him where he grew up (Wales), how big his family was (three
 sisters), and what his first gig was (a Pac-Man cereal commercial). 
[He] didn’t seem to have even a basic understanding of how ‘The Tonight 
Show’ worked,' Berg writes. 'I was glad he dropped out, thus averting an
 awkward on-air ­exchange with Jay.'

According to Berg, Christian Bale abruptly ended a pre-show interview before a Tonight Show appearance

Kobe Bryant never appeared on Leno's show again after Leno made a joke about Bryant's then-fresh sexual assault case

In addition to dealing with stars that couldn't handle an interview with Jay, Berg also recounts how things said on the show or behind the scenes caused some celebrities to boycott the show.

According to Berg, Helen Hunt was particularly thin-skinned. After a producer critiqued her performance during an 
appearance to promote the then-hit NBC sitcom 'Mad About You,”' she refused to return for 14 
years.

Kobe Bryant also boycotted Leno, after Leno made a joke about his rape case. Bryant was accused of sexually assaulting a 19-year-old in 2003.

Not that show snubs were a one way street. The book claims that during the O.J. Simpson media spectacle, Leno snubbed Simpson's attorney Johnnie Cochran as a guest. Leno reportedly felt strongly that Simpson had committed the murders. Leno did allow prosecutors Marcia Clark and Christopher Darden to come on.

Once on the show, some celebs did not perform quite as expected. The show staff learned in an interview with Jesse Jackson that he had immense stage fright.

According to Berg, Jesse Jackson had serious stage fright before his appearance, unable to keep his balance without assistance backstage

Qunetin Tarantino reportedly had too much to drink at the 'Jay Bar' to calm his nerves, resulting in him slurring his words during his interview

'I never would have guessed that this prominent civil rights activist 
and one-time presidential candidate would be a nervous Nellie,' said 
Berg, adding 'One time he was shaking so hard backstage, he had to hold onto me
 for support..'

To help with the pre-show jitters, Leno had 'The Jay Bar' installed, complete with enough beer and wine to loosen up guests. However, some guests like Quentin Tarantino in 2003 took too much advantage of the booze, in Tarantino's case causing him to slur his words on-air.

The demands of oft-pampered Hollywood divas frequently annoyed Berg and other producers of the show. Berg claims that when Eddie Murphy showed up for an appearance, he came with an extensive rider to cover the 45 minutes he would be spending at the studio.

Included on the rider was '4 Snapple Fruit Punch, 4 Snapple Orangeade, 4 Snapple Grapeade, 4 Dr. 
Browne’s Cream Soda, 4 Dr. Browne’s Root Beer, Coke in glass bottles, 
bananas, cherries, Evian bottled water, Juicy Fruit Gum, Snickers, Milky
 Ways, peppermints, York Peppermint Patties, writing pads/pencils/pens, 
regular-sized towels, washcloths/small.'

For an appearance, Jessica Simpson demanded that the show cover the bill for her hair and makeup, which she said would be approximately $18,000. Leno refused.

That's not to say that Leno did not sometimes open up the show's wallet for guests. The show paid $35,000 in 2008 to charter a plane for Sarah Palin and her family to fly in from Anchorage, Alaska.

To woo an appearance from President Bill Clinton, Berg on behalf of the show sent him a custom-made tandem bicycle as a get-well present after his heart surgery in 2004, which cost $12,000. Clinton sent the bike back, as Hilary Clinton was a senator in New York at the time (and thus could not legally accept the gift.)

Another bike was commissioned, which Clinton accepted. However, he still did not come on the show, his aides telling Berg that he 'simply didn’t like Jay’s never-ending Monica Lewinsky jokes.'

Barack Obama's 2009 appearance on the Tonight Show marked the first time an active U.S. President had ever been a guest on a late-night TV talk show

Despite being gifted a custom-made bike, President Clinton never made an appearance on the Tonight Show, as he did not like Leno's Lewinsky jokes

According to a study by the Center for Media and Public Affairs at George Mason University, President Clinton was the target of the most amount of jokes told by Jay Leno during his tenure with the Tonight Show, with 4,607 jokes at his expense. Leno also told 454 jokes with Monica Lewinsky as the subject.

Other divas grappled with by the Tonight Show included Paula Abdul, who Berg could never be sure would be 'coherent' in interviews, and Dennis Rodman, who was typically late to each of his 28 appearances on the show.
