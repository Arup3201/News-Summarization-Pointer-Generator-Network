Fresh off a Super Bowl victory, the New England Patriots seemed to get a win on the Deflate-gate front Monday as it emerged that only one of the 11 under-filled balls was significantly below the minimum inflation.

Also working in favor of team Brady was the added detail that the mysterious locker room staffer seen on video going with the balls from one room to another before taking them to the field was, in fact, an elderly Pats employee who appeared to stop into a restroom before delivering the balls.

Of those balls, reports NFL.com, 10 were likely just slightly under-inflated while only one was a full two pounds per square inch below the 12.5PSI minimum.

Accused of tampering: New England Patriots quarterback Tom Brady is fresh off a big Super Bowl win. Will favorable new Deflate-gate details help bolster his already high spirits?

 

The Patriots worker who became the focus of an NFL investigation after footage showed him carrying game balls into a room before he took them to the field was an elderly gentleman.

The room he entered with the balls was a bathroom and he was there for 98 seconds.

Both Tom Brady and coach Bill Belichick have adamantly denied any involvement.

Eleven of the 12 ‘Deflate-gate balls’ were under-inflated, though only one was two pounds below the required PSI of 12.5 while the others were below by only a small amount.

The investigation is ongoing. NFL commissioner Roger Goodell said Friday that 'we have made no judgments.'

So do these facts deflate the case against the Pats? Not totally, says NFL commissioner Roger Goodell, who said Friday that 'we have made no judgments' regarding the the investigation.

The growing storm over the team's use of illegal balls, which is being referred to as 'deflate-gate,' dominated the buildup to the Febuary 1 Super Bowl versus the Seahawks.

Under NFL rules, game balls must be inflated to between 12.5 and 13.5 pounds per square inch and no alteration is allowed once they are approved.

Patriots quarterback Tom Brady threw three touchdown passes during that game in wet conditions where a firm grip on a slippery ball could have helped.

Both Brady and Patriots head coach Bill Belichick have professed innocence regarding the deflated ball issue and said they knew nothing about it until Monday.

Patriots owner Robert Kraft said investigators spent three days at the team's facility during which they were given access to every full- and part-time employee they requested to speak with and every communication device that they wanted to search.

In fact, it was the Patriots themselves who turned over footage of the elderly equipment attendant and his 98-second restroom dalliance.

As the Patriots move into the calmer off-season, the NFL says its investigation into Deflate-gate will continue.

A whiff of scandal continued to hang over Sunday's game even as the Vince Lombardi Trophy was hoisted and confetti fell from the roof of the University of Phoenix Stadium still trembling from New England's heart stopping win.

'We won that (AFC) game 45-7, we won today 28-24,' defended a defiant Patriots owner Robert Kraft through the celebratory din. 'Our people didn't touch the balls. I love our team, I'm proud of our guys. 'We're going to carry on and hopefully continue to do well. 

'Every year if you're privileged to get to this game, hard things happen. I'm so proud of (Tom) Brady and (coach Bill) Belichick for handling things the way they did.'

As the NFL's investigation into 'deflate-gate' continues, the spotlight of suspicion remains firmly fixed on the Patriots with some fans even questioning why New England was allowed to play in the Super Bowl at all.

A battling Brady spent Sunday rewriting the Super Bowl quarterbacking record books, setting new marks for single-game completions (37), most career passing yards (1,605) and career touchdowns (13) to claim a third most valuable player award.

'It's just a lot of mental toughness, I think the whole team had it,' said Brady when asked how the team was able to deal with the controversy and focus on the game. 'The coach always says, ignore the noise and control what you can control.'

But the Patriots and Belichick, the only coach to take a team to six Super Bowls, have also developed a reputation as a team not above a bit of skullduggery.

In 2007, Belichick was fined $500,000 and the Patriots lost a first-round draft pick after an investigation found New England had videotaped an opponent's signals on the sidelines in what became known as 'Spygate'.
