Researchers have created the ultimate beer taster - a robot tongue so sensitive it can distinguish between different varieties and even check alcohol content.

The Spanish team say their 'robo-tongue' is the first to be able to spot its favourite tipple - and could find a job in the quality control areas of brewers.

The team used 21 sensors in their robo-tongue, and trained it to distinguish between Schwarzbier, lager, double malt, Pilsen, Alsatian and low-alcohol.

The end of the bad pint: The robo-tongue can tell if a pint tastes as it should, and has the right alcohol content

Some scientists claim beer - not bread - is the reason early man adopted a society based on farming around 10,000 years ago, a key moment in our evolution.

The cultivation of grain saw the transition away from a hunter-gatherer lifestyle and a widely-accepted theory is that the crops were used to bake bread, but experts claim it was the prospect of a brew that drove the desire to settle down and start a farm.

Researchers say beer has a number of advantages beyond the intoxicating effects and taste, such as a high B vitamin content, the essential amino acid lysine and the fact it was safer to drink than water as the brewing process killed off bacteria and viruses.

The discovery, published in the journal 'Food Chemistry', is accurate in almost 82% of cases.

Beer is the oldest and most widely consumed alcoholic drink in the world.

Now, scientists at the Autonomous University of Barcelona have led a study which analysed several brands of beer by applying a new concept in analysis systems, known as an electronic tongue, the idea for which is based on the human sense of taste.

'The concept of the electronic tongue consists in using a generic array of sensors, in other words with generic response to the various chemical compounds involved, which generate a varied spectrum of information with advanced tools for processing, pattern recognition and even artificial neural networks,' said Manel del Valle, the main author of the study.

The array of sensors was formed of 21 ion-selective electrodes, including some with response to cations (ammonium, sodium), others with response to anions (nitrate, chloride, etc.), as well as electrodes with generic (unspecified) response to the varieties considered.

The electronic beer tester: Spanish researchers have managed to distinguish between different varieties of beer using an electronic tongue. The discovery, published in the journal 'Food Chemistry', is accurate in almost 82 percent of cases.

The machine then 'learnt' to taste the different varieties.

'Using more powerful tools â€“ supervised learning â€“ and linear discriminant analysis did enable us to distinguish between the main categories of beer we studied: Schwarzbier, lager, double malt, Pilsen, Alsatian and low-alcohol,' Del Valle said.

The study concluded that these tools could one day give robots a sense of taste, and even supplant panels of tasters in the food industry to improve the quality and reliability of products for consumption.

The breakthrough is expected to be used by the brewing industry to supplement human beer tasters
