A couple in upstate New York have been charged and could face one year in jail after their toddler used their cellphones to make more than 15 calls to 911 when there was no emergency.

Heaven Britton, 23, and her boyfriend Jason Hatcher, 33, both of Lowville, were told by a Lewis County 911 Dispatch Center call-taker to hide their phones.

It came after Britton's two-year-old daughter made a first call to emergency while playing with a cell.

But then, throughout January, the little girl continued to find the phones and dial 9-1-1.

Lock up the phone: Heaven Britton, 23, was charged with obstructing governmental administration - a misdemeanor charge - in Lowville, NY, on Thursday after her two-year-old made 15 unnecessary 911 calls

Britton's boyfriend, Jason R. Hatcher, 33, has also been charged and faces up to one year in jail

On Wednesday, Village of Lowville police officer Matthew Martin spoke to the pair after the persistent child made a 14th call.

He warned them to keep all phones away from her or face further action, according to Syracuse.

But the toddler made a 15th call later that night.

Martin returned to the home, at 5497 Water St, Lowville, the next day and charged both Britton and Hatcher with obstructing governmental administration.

The charge is a class A misdemeanor and carries a maximum penalty of one year jail.

The calls were made from this address in Lowville, in upstate New York

After Heaven Britton was charged over the calls her daughter made to 911, police say the toddler dialed the number three more times the following day

It is usually dealt to people who argue with police officers or interfere with the arrest of another party.

Despite the charges, Martin said the little girl called 911 three more times on Friday.

Police believe there is no reason to suspect the child was in any harm or danger.
