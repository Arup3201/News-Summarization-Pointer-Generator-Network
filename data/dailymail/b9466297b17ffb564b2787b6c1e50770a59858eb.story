A nuclear power plant in Ukraine suffered a technical error which caused a drop in electricity supplies in the war-torn country, it emerged today.

The plant's operator announced on Monday that a problem had occurred with a power-generating unit at the site.

But Prime Minister Arseniy Yatsenyuk provoked further concern today when he referred to the incident during a Cabinet meeting. 

Nearly 30 years on, Ukraine still struggles to deal with legacy of the Chernobyl nuclear disaster which caused thousands of deaths.

Nuclear fault: The Zaporizhzhya nuclear power plant is the largest in Europe and suffered an accident earlier this week, according to premier Arseniy Yatsenyuk

Volodymyr Demchyshyn, the energy minister, said a short circuit at a power-generating unit in the Zaporizhzhya nuclear power plant (NPP) plant led to a drop in electricity production. 

But he insisted that the fault posed no danger and the plant would return to running as normal on Friday. 

'There is no threat ... there are no problems with the
reactors,' he said, adding that the accident affected the power output system and 'in no way' was linked to
power production itself.

In Vienna, the International Atomic Energy Agency said it
had no immediate comment on the report.

Under an international
convention, adopted after the 1986 Chernobyl accident in what
was then Soviet Ukraine, a country should notify the IAEA of any
nuclear accident that can impact other countries.

The explosion and fire at the Chernobyl power plant, the world's worst nuclear accident, was caused by human error and a series of blasts sent a cloud of radioactive dust billowing across northern and western Europe. 

Volodymyr Demchyshyn, Ukraine's energy minister, briefed the media on the accident during a news conference, insisting everything at the plant will be back to normal on Friday

Ukraine, Belarus and Russia, have estimated the death toll at only a few thousand as a result of the explosion while the environmental group Greenpeace says the accident will eventually cause up to 93,000 extra cancer deaths worldwide.

Interfax news agency said a 1,000-megawatt reactor was housed in the bloc at Zaporizhzhya where last Friday's accident occurred.

Mr Demchyshyn said the affected bloc had been provisionally disconnected from the electro-energy system though its reactor continued to work normally.

'Its power output is not being used. I think that the problem will be resolved by Friday,' he said.

The accident has had an impact on Ukraine's energy system, but Mr Demchyshyn said he would ask the major industrial consumers to impose a 'voluntary restriction' in energy consumption.

Ukraine produced more than 60 million tonnes of coal last year, making it self-sufficient in electricity and coal.

Separatist fighting in the Donetsk and Luhansk regions since June has halted production at 66 coal mines, however, leaving Ukrainian power plants without enough raw materials.
