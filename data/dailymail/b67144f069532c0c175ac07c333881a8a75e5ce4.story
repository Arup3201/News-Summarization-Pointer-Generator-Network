They are treasures that shed light on one of the greatest love stories of the 20th century.

From fabulous jewels to deeply personal gifts, the precious objects which once belonged to the Duke and Duchess of Windsor give a rare insight into the life of a king – and the woman for whom he sacrificed the throne.

Yesterday, as they were sold for £620,125 at auction, they also served to underline some of the torment the couple endured during a romance that scandalised the monarchy and threatened the constitution.

Edward VIII and Wallis Simpson's relationship shocked the nation, as Mrs Simpson was a divorcee, prompting the Queen's uncle to abdicate his throne in order to marry his sweetheart

Edward VIII’s affair with American divorcee Wallis Simpson shocked the nation and forced him to abdicate in 1936 to marry his sweetheart. 

The couple famously chronicled their partnership with a succession of diamonds and gifts made out of precious stones, many inscribed with heartfelt messages relating to special moments the couple shared together.

Most of those items were sold 26 years ago in a spectacular auction that attracted widespread interest from celebrities, royalty and wealthy collectors around the world. 

Yesterday Sotheby’s auctioned off another set of jewels, in a sale it said would celebrate the stylish couple’s ‘exquisite taste’ and position them against a backdrop of four generations of British monarchs.

Perhaps the most poignant item was a fob watch that marked the lovers’ enforced separation during the time that they were waiting for her divorce to come through, before they were finally able to marry in 1937. 

Wallis gave it to ‘David’, the family name for Edward, at Easter that year. On one side of the dial she wrote her name; on the other, the name of the lover who – in time – she would finally be allowed to call her husband.

Also sold yesterday was a magnificently extravagant Cartier sapphire bracelet, which Wallis wore when the Queen dropped by to visit the couple at the house they shared in the Bois de Boulogne near Paris. 

She called there with the Duke of Edinburgh and Prince Charles during a state visit to France in 1972. Edward – battling cancer – died ten days later.

Sotheby’s jewellery division chairman David Bennett said there was a ‘continuing fascination’ for jewellery and precious objects associated with the couple, particularly items that gave insights into their life together.

During their famous love affair, Wallis Simpson and the Duke of Windsor exchanged beautiful diamonds and poignant gifts, many inscribed with heartfelt messages

Few could have imagined, as the 20th century dawned, that an American socialite would prove the cause of the biggest constitutional crisis the Royal Family - and the UK - has ever faced.But Wallis Simpson was no ordinary socialite and her future husband Edward VIII, no ordinary king.The pair met in January 1934 and twice-divorced Simpson and the then Prince of Wales swiftly fell in love.At first the relationship raised few concerns, Edward was notorious for his affairs with society ladies, but that all changed when George V died on the 20th January 1936.When, the next day, the new King-Emperor chose to watch the proclamation of his accession in the company of Simpson, it became clear that he intended to marry her.This precipitated a crisis, firstly because the political establishment considered a twice-divorced woman an unsuitable consort, and secondly, because Edward was now head of the Church of England, which at the time, did not allow marriages between divorcees.Edward suggested a morganatic marriage which would have prevented Simpson becoming Queen Consort, but the prime ministers of the UK, Australia and South Africa rejected the plan.By early December, the true nature of Simpson's relationship with the King had become public knowledge and she fled the country.Despite attempts by Simpson to get him to reconsider, on the 13th December 1936, Edward abdicated and was succeeded by his brother, George VII.The couple eventually married, a month after Wallis' second divorce was granted, on the 3rd June 1937 in the south of France.Although Edward had been created the Duke of Windsor by his brother and was entitled to the style 'His Royal Highness', his wife was refused the honour and was styled instead as 'Her Grace.'
