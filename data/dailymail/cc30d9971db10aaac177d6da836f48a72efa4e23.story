 

A Maine man posed for a jail booking photo after his arrest for DUI in June wearing a t-shirt featuring a very similar scene.

Robert Burt, 19, was caught driving while under the influence of alcohol and without a license back in June and ordered to spend two days in prison in August.

He decided to show up for his sentence at the Somerset County Jail in an orange t-shirt featuring his booking shot from the original arrest with the caption: 'Burt Family Reunion 8/8 - 8/10/2014.'

Seeing double:  Maine man was arrested and posed for a mugshot wearing a t-shirt printed with his previous mugshot on it

According to The Smoking Gun, the caption refers to a relative of Burt's who is also serving time at the prison.

Burt's orange t-shirt was made for him by some thoughtful co-workers.

According to his Facebook page, he works at Vittles Restaurant in Pittsfield.

Burt, who lists his past academic studies as 'alternitve (sic) education,' says Somerset County corrections officers were in on the joke.

He wrote on Facebook that they made him hold the slate in such a way 'so you could see the shirt.'

'They laughed there (sic) asses off haha,' he wrote.

Cheers: Burt celebrates his release with a beer

According to The Smoking Gun, below Burt's mugshot was an image of a cat on a couch with a beer and a remote control.

He served his two days in prison earlier in the month and is now out enjoying his freedom.

'I'm out b*tchs (sic),' he wrote on August 10 before posting his infamous mugshot.

'Its (sic) the sh*t,' he wrote.
