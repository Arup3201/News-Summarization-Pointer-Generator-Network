EXCLUSIVE

Manchester United are poised to go head-to-head for Arsenal defender Bacary Sagna next week.

Sportsmail understands overtures from Old Trafford to the Frenchman's representatives have been made over the last 48 hours.

As we revealed on Friday night, Sagna will hold formal talks with Manchester City representatives next week with a view to a four-year deal worth a minimum of £100,000-per-week.

All smiles: Manchester United and City want to sign Arsenal defender Bacary Sagna ahead of next season

Wanted: Soon-to-be Manchester United manager Louis Van Gaal has identified Sagna as a possible signing

The Etihad Stadium club are well advanced in their interest in the France international - but United want to pip their city rivals to his signing.

Next United boss Louis van Gaal has identified Sagna as the man he wants to contest the right-back slot with Rafael.

Stealing Sagna from under City's noses would be a spectacular way of announcing himself to the United faithful.

But City remain firm favourites to land the Frenchman this summer.

Barring any last minute hitches, Sagna's intention was to sign for City following next week's talks.

However, United's last minute interest may cause a rethink.

Potential understudy? Argentina international Pablo Zabaleta is City's current first choice right-back

With Pablo Zabaleta fully established as the City's first choice right-back, Sagna would face big competition for games.

Sagna may find first team football easier to come by with a move to Old Trafford.

The defender wants his future resolved before the start of the World Cup as he wants a clear mind going into the tournament.
