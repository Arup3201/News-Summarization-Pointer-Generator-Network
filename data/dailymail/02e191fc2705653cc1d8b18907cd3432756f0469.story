A BBC presenter has appealed for the return of her laptop and valuable family heirlooms which were taken from her home.

Wendy Hurrell, who presents the weather on BBC London, lost 'irreplaceable' belongings when her home was burgled.

She took to Twitter in an attempt to track down the thieves - and joked that her computer would 'self-combust' if it was not returned.

Victim: BBC London presenter Wendy Hurrell had her home in South London burgled last week

Miss Hurrell, 31, revealed that the burglars had entered her South London home via a small window which she had left ajar when she was out of the house.

'So far from understanding how someone can walk into a stranger's house and just help themselves to stuff they didn't earn. #pathetic,' she tweeted last Saturday.

'Tonnes of irreplaceable pictures from my laptop, gone. Jewellery belonging to my late grandmother, gone.

'Worthless laptop with priceless pictures. Late grandmother's jewellery. Yeah, good start to the day.'

The Goldsmiths graduate then joked that stealing the electronic equipment would rebound on the burglars, saying they would end up like Gollum from Lord of the Rings.

'Hey robbers - that laptop you took from my house will self-combust in 5,4,3,' she tweeted. 'And the camera? It's watching you...

'As for the ring, well - you saw what it did to Gollum...'

Miss Hurrell, who previously made headlines when she was caught rolling her eyes on live television, said that the most painful loss was an eternity ring.

The ring was given by her grandfather to her grandmother, who died last year.

The laptop which was taken contained photographs of a friend's wedding and children, while a camera was also stolen.

The theft came only a few days after comedian Miranda Hart also took to Twitter to ask for her laptop to be returned following a burglary.

The star of sitcom Miranda offered a reward for the computer, which contained 'precious creative projects'.
