We've all done it: posed for a photograph only for the person snapping on their camera phone to realise they were actually taking a video.

But usually the friend is good enough to delete the video, allowing us to forget about any embarrassment and move on with our lives.

Not so in the case of some unfortunate hipster clubbers in Dublin, Ireland. These poor souls held their variously awkward poses for a photographer... unaware the photographer was actually taking a video he was going to use in a mocking YouTube montage.

And now the video's gone viral, with over 88,000 views on the site. Ouch.

SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO

The clubbers all pout and flutter their eyelids throughout the video, changing their faces for the camerawoman

The video, set to Carly Simon's song You're So Vain, was created by the clubnight organisers and uploaded onto YouTube

The clubbers were filmed by organisers of the controversially-named club night C U Next Tuesday (abbreviated to C**T), and the final montage is set to the song You're So Vain by Carly Simon.

The young men and women stick their tongues out, pout, pretend to scream and laugh uproariously, and it's all captured on camera in a video entitled 'Incredibly awkward montage of C***s.'

Only at the end does one young man realise the woman behind the camera is filming them and taking the mickey, and he walks away in a huff.

The video has already been viewed 88,000 times on YouTube.

The Daily Edge, who reported the story, said on their website: 'They went to C**T for the craic, and now they look like goons.'

The cringeworthy video is, in places, almost too awkward to watch
