Paul Jewell and Dave Kemp have been confirmed as Tony Pulis' new assistants at West Brom.

The duo are joint-assistant head coaches in the new set-up at The Hawthorns.

Gerry Francis is also expected to be appointed on a part-time basis and, along with Kemp, worked with Pulis at Stoke.

Carlo Nash - who worked with Pulis at Stoke - is also set to be announced as the new goalkeeping coach

Kemp was Pulis' assistant at the Britannia Stadium and Crystal Palace and watched Albion's 1-1 draw at West Ham on New Year's Day, the day Pulis was named head coach.

Carlo Nash, who played for Pulis at Stoke, is poised to be the Baggies' new goalkeeping coach.

Ex-Derby boss Jewell has been out of work since leaving as Ipswich manager in 2012 and, along with Kemp and Francis, will be confirmed as part of the new-look Baggies backroom team in the next 24 hours.

They will be in the dugout for Saturday's crucial Barclays Premier League visit of Hull, with Albion a point and a place above the bottom three.

Pulis won his first game in charge on Saturday, a 7-0 thrashing of Gateshead in the FA Cup.

He swung the axe on Monday as coaches Rob Kelly, Keith Downing and Dean Kiely left Albion, following former head coach Alan Irvine after he was sacked last week, paving the way for his staff revamp.

In a statement on West Brom's website, Pulis said: 'I don't know what I've done to suffer Kempy again but I suppose I will have to put up with him!

'But the truth is that we have a working relationship which I value very highly – he knows what I want without even having to ask these days.

'Jewely is someone I have known for a long time. We got to know each other on coaching courses as well as in opposition – he has massive experience and when I thought about what I wanted for this post, he fitted the bill perfectly.

'I'm delighted we have got him and I am sure the players will enjoy working with him.

'There are one or two other things we shall be putting in place over the next few days before everything is settled.

'It is never a pleasant task making changes because it always means some fellow professionals have to leave the club. I would just like to say that while I only worked with Keith, Dean and Rob for a short time, they impressed me as top lads who I wish well for the future.'

West Bromwich Albion today announce the departures of senior coaches Rob Kelly, Keith Downing and Dean Kiely.

The trio have left the club with immediate effect as Tony Pulis prepares to finalise the appointment of a new backroom staff.

Director of football administration Richard Garlick said: 'The Club would like to place on record its deep appreciation for the contribution of Keith, Rob and Dean within the coaching structure.

'Keith and Dean have been here a number of years and took over first-team control in a caretaker capacity during a difficult period last season. They played a key role in stabilising the team.

'Rob joined at the start of the season and became a valued member of the coaching set-up.

'Changes in personnel are part of football life and it is obviously sad to say farewell to three popular and respected members of staff.

'We wish to thank them for their efforts and wish them all the very best in their future endeavours.'

Downing became first-team coach under Roy Hodgson, in March 2011, before being elevated to Assistant Head Coach in December 2011 following the departure of Michael Appleton to become Portsmouth manager.

Following Steve Clarke's departure in December 2013, Downing took the reins at The Hawthorns in caretaker capacity - his side winning one and drawing three of his five Barclays Premier League games in charge.

Albion recruited Downing as Academy Under-18s coach in July 2009. He also became responsible for running the Baggies' Barclays Premier Reserve League team at the start of the 2010/11 campaign.

Kelly joined Albion as Alan Irvine's Joint-Assistant Head Coach alongside Downing in June.

Kiely became Albion Goalkeeper Coach in March 2010.

The former Republic of Ireland man initially joined the club as a player in January 2007, helping the club to the Championship play-off final later that year.

The following season he scooped the Championship's 2007/08 Puma Golden Glove thanks to his 18 clean sheets in all competitions after helping Albion clinch the title and reach and FA Cup semi-final.

He made 88 appearances for Albion as a player.
