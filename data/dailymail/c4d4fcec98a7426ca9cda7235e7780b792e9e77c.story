Satellite images are being used to monitor how ocean acidification is changing the world's seas.

For the first time, scientists have been able to obtain a global picture of how rising carbon dioxide levels in the atmosphere are affecting the oceans.

Using thermal cameras and microwave sensors mounted on satellites orbiting 435 miles above Earth, the experts said it's possible to assess which areas of the ocean are most at risk of acidification.

Scientists have used satellite data to map the alkalinity of the world's oceans for the first time. The image above shows the average level of alkalinity over the past five years with blue marking water that is more acidic. By using satellite data, scientists can obtain live information as the ocean changes

As the acidity of seawater rises, it can change the chemistry of the oceans and is expected to have a profound affect on marine animals.

A recent study funded by the European Union found that ocean acidification is already having a profound impact on herring in the Baltic Sea.

This heavily fished area has already seen pH values of 7.2 being recorded, so scientists wanted to see what impact it was having.

They hatched eggs taken from herring caught off the coast of Norway and reared them in outdoor tanks with different levels of aciditiy.

Those reared in tanks with pH values of 7.45 and 7.07 showed more signs of organ damage than those in low acidity water.

They had more damage in the liver, kidneys and their find were often abnormally shaped while they tended to develop more slowly.

After 39 days, the fish larvae in the medium acidity tank weighed 30 per cent less than those in normal waters while those in the high acidity tank weighted 40 per cent less.

The researchers said that these smaller fish would be more at risk of being preyed upon and are less able to survive. 

Shellfish will struggle to find enough of the minerals they use to make their shells while the fish that feed on them will also suffer.

Dr Jamie Shutler, an ocean scientist at the University of Exeter, said: 'It can be both difficult and expensive to take year-round direct measurements in such inaccessible locations.

'We are pioneering these techniques so  we can monitor large areas of the Earth’s oceans allowing us to quickly and easily identify those areas most at risk from the increasing acidification.'

Currently scientists have to rely on measurements taken by instruments left in the oceans and research vessels around the world to build up a picture of ocean acidification.

By using satellite data, scientists can instead obtain live information as the ocean changes rather than snapshots in time.

In a paper for the journal Environmental Science and Technology Letters, the researchers explained  they could combine data from a number of satellites to watch how rising carbon dioxide levels affect the oceans.

They are using the European's Soil Moisture and Ocean Salinity sensor (SMOS), which was launched in 2009, and Nasa's Aquarius satellite that launched in 2011.

It is estimated that around a quarter of the carbon dioxide emitted into the atmosphere is absorbed by the ocean.

A recent study by the European Union found that ocean acidification is already having a profound impact on herring in the Baltic Sea, for example.

Lead researcher Dr Peter Land, from the Plymouth Marine Laboratory, said the new satellite techniques would allow scientists to monitor vulnerable areas such as the Arctic seas, the Bay of Bengal and the Caribbean simultaneously.

He said: 'In recent years, great advances have been made in the global provision of satellite and in situ data.

'It is now time to evaluate how to make the most of these new data sources to help us monitor ocean acidification, and to establish where satellite data can make the best contribution.'

Prawns (stock image) could taste less appetising in the future if the oceans grow more acidic

Marine biologists have found that shellfish take on a sour flavour if they are reared in slightly acidified sea water.

They warn that as the planet's oceans grow more acidic, due to rising carbon dioxide levels, many of our favourite seafoods could become less appetising.

Climate change experts predict that over the next century, the levels of the world's oceans could drop from pH8 to pH7.5.

Many have warned this could lead to shrimps and prawns struggling to build the shells and skeletons they need to survive.

Now, in the first study to test how ocean acidification could impact the taste of seafood, researchers at the University of Gothenberg and Plymouth University found it will make them sour. 

During tests, shrimp raised in water with a lower pH were 2.6 times more likely to be rated as the worst tasting.

While those reared in the less acidic water were 3.4 times more likely to be judged the tastiest.

Also the 63 per cent of the shrimp from the acidic water died during the three weeks.

The results could have profound implications for the seafood industry as it suggests shellfish will become harder as their numbers dwindle, but also demand could decrease as people lose their taste for them.
