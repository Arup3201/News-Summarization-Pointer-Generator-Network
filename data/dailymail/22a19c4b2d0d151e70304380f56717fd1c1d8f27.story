Santa was apparently right on target for Christmas for South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley.

The Republican posted on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram on Thursday a picture of the Beretta PX4 Storm she got as a present, saying she must have been good to have received such a nice present from Santa Claus.

The gun costs $575 and, according to the Berretta website, is good for 'faster follow up shots'.

A spokesman for the mother-of-two confirmed that the gift was from Haley's husband, Michael, and that she 'cannot wait to get on the range and fire the pistol'.

Real-life version of A Christmas Story: Nikki Haley Facebooked a photo of the Beretta she received for Christmas along with the message: 'Our family had a wonderful Christmas together! I must have been good Santa gave me a Beretta PX4 Storm.'

The post garnered more than 10,000 likes and 1,100 comments as of midday Thursday, many of which in support of Haley having a firearm.

'My kind of governor!' wrote one supporter.

'It makes me proud to be a South Carolinian. Way to go, Gov. Haley,' another said.

But not all the comments were supportive.

'True Love is certainly attainable with weapons that bring death and violence,' said one person.

'Nothing says 'I love you' like a machine designed to kill another human being.'

Another comment read: 'Ah yes, a holiday that's supposed to celebrate peace and love and she gets an instrument of violence and death.'

The governor is no stranger to firearms and has made headlines for her affinity with them in the past.

She has a concealed weapons permit, and she got plenty of attention in July when her office posted a video of her firing a machine gun while touring a gun manufacturer in Columbia, S.C.

Haley is shown in the video examining a variety of guns and speaking with FN Manufacturing employees before taking to the shooting range.

'It was a good time, it was a good stress reliever,' she said in the video, after taking several target shots.

'And I did it in heels!'

Haley will be running as an incumbent in South Carolina’s 2014 gubernatorial election.
