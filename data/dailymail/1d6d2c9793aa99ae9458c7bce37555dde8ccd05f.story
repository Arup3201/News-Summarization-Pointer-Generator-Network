Peter Williamson admitted assaulting taxi driver with his walking stick after fearing he was late for opera

An opera lover beat up a taxi driver with his walking stick because he thought he was going to ‘miss a performance of Puccini’.

Peter Williamson, 69, flagged down a cab while he was on his way to see the open air opera in Holland Park, west London and told the driver he would need to stop for cash.

A court heard the retired doctor became irate with driver Kevin Johnson, fearing he was late and shouted: ‘Where are we you f*****g c***’.

Mr Johnson stopped his taxi at a cash point on Kensington High Street and watched as Williamson walked past the machine.

He climbed out the car to point him in the right direction but Williamson raised his stick above his head and struck him with the handle – leaving the driver bleeding and needing stitches.

Physicist Williamson, who is a fellow with the Royal Institution, admitted assault occasioning actual bodily harm at Hammersmith Magistrates’ Court today.

Prosecutor Helen Clutton said Williamson was picked up in Wimbledon on June 17 after he flagged down a taxi in the street as he wanted to go and see a performance of Puccini’s lesser known works ‘The Girl of the Golden West.’ 

But he had become infuriated by the time they had reached Warwick Road near Earls Court.

‘He shouted at the victim ‘where are we you f*****g c***’ and demanded ‘Where are you f*****g taking me’, said Ms Clutton.

‘The victim could not understand why Dr Williamson was getting so irate and wanted to get him out of the taxi as soon as possible.

‘They got to Kensington High Street where the victim pulled over and stopped by Sainsbury’s which is directly opposite a cash machine.

‘There is only one machine, he walked towards the machine and there was man there already using the machine.

‘Dr Williamson did not make any effort to join the queue behind the man.’

Mr Johnson climbed out of the taxi as Williamson walked past the man using the cashpoint, the court heard.

‘Mr Johnson got out of the taxi and showed Mr Williamson where it was, he said: “Look, you have just gone past it, it is over there”,’ said Ms Clutton.

‘They got almost parallel with the cashpoint machine and the victim turned around to check Dr Williamson was coming with him.

‘Dr Williamson lifted his walking stick straight over his right shoulder and struck his victim over the head,’ she said.

‘It was similar to a hammer hitting a nail,’ said Ms Clutton.

Williamson is said to have struck him twice with the ornate heavy handle of his walking stick in the ‘repeated assault’.

‘Mr Johnson reached up to touch his head with his right hand and when he brought his hand down it was covered in blood.’

The driver sustained a two inch wound and had two stitches after the unprovoked attack.

District Judge Denis Brennan noted the defendant’s good character but said he was still ‘at risk of a custodial sentence’.

The hearing was adjourned for a pre-sentence report to be prepared and Williamson, from Wimbledon, is due to face a sentencing hearing at Hammersmith Magistrates’ Court on September 18.
