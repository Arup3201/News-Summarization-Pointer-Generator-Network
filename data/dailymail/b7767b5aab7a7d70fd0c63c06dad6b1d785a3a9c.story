Lottery winner Adrian Bayford has already been bombarded with requests for cash following his huge £148million win - despite being away on holiday with his family.

The tiny shop which he jointly runs with his best friend in the Suffolk town of Haverhill has seen dozens of letters pour through its doors since he went public with his huge win on Tuesday.

His best friend and business partner Richard Hudspith - who is keeping the Suffolk Music Centre running - said the requests for money had been piling up.

In demand: Lottery winner Adrian Bayford (pictured with his wife Gillian), has shut his business after he was  bombarded with requests for cash following his huge £148miillion win

Bombarded: They were rumours that the couple were forced to close their music shop (above) because of nuisance and abuse from beggars, but Gillian has denied this was the case

'Put it this way, there has been more mail than you normally get with your morning coffee,' he said.

After winning the Euromillions jackpot, Mr Bayford and his wife Gillian caught an easyJet flight for a short break with their two young children.

And
 rather than make for the sun and five-star luxury, they appear to have 
headed north to spend time at the windswept Scottish caravan park where 
Mrs Bayford’s parents live.

The manager of the Barry Downs site in
 Carnoustie, Angus, said yesterday: 'Yes, they are here but they don’t 
want to be disturbed. They are not giving interviews but they are here 
on the park.'

The couple went on the modest break 
with their children, Aimee, six, and Cameron, four, after the press 
conference on Tuesday where their identities were revealed.

Mr
 Hudspith, 39, said he had since spoken to Mr Bayford while he is on his
 break and said they are trying to let everything sink in.

'They are fine. They just want to have some time with each other and the children and various other members of family.

'They are just trying to let this all sink in and carry on as normal, the children come first for them.'

Already the couple have showed signs that there new found vast wealth won't go to their head.

In it to win it! Richard Hudspith told the couple to spend their money how they please

The Bayfords flew with easyJet to an undisclosed location in Europe for their first holiday abroad as a family

They queued with other passengers at 
Stansted Airport before flying off to their hideaway where they will 'acclimatise' to their newfound wealth.

The only nod to luxury was the Air 
Harrods helicopter that whisked them from the hotel near Bishop’s 
Stortford, Hertfordshire, to the airport four miles away – and that was 
paid for by lottery organiser Camelot.

Mr Hudspith thinks the couple will continue to keep their feet on the ground.

'I know Camelot do lots to help people who come into large sums of money and I think they are listening to the right sort of advice.

'Obviously it is going to be life-changing for them but as people they will still have the same values and that is that their children will come first.

'They will probably move but I believe they will stay in the area.'

The gated caravan park where the 
Bayfords are staying has a bar, cafe and newsagents, as well as a gym 
and hairdresser. An adjoining field has pitches for tents.

Entertainment includes pub quizzes and bingo on Friday and Saturday nights.

Reviewers on one camping website gave 
Barry Downs six out of ten. Highlights are the reasonably-priced cafe, 
an entertainer whose ‘singing...was good’ and ‘immaculate’ beaches 
nearby.

But some complained about showers that
 were prone to flooding, toilets that were 'not as clean as they 
could’ve been' and a lack of activities for children.

Meanwhile back home in Haverhill, 
Suffolk, it was business as usual at Suffolk Music Centre, the 
secondhand records and musical instruments shop Mr Bayford runs and now 
hopes to expand.

A steady stream of customers arrived to offer their congratulations after co-owner Richard Hudspith opened up yesterday.

The determined show of normality was 
confirmed by Mr Bayford’s aunt, Linda Beesley, who said the couple 
wanted to shield their children from upheaval after scooping Britain’s 
second largest EuroMillions win.

Payout: The Bayfords won £148million in August, one of the biggest lottery jackpots in history

'If they’re going to move house they 
will tell the children what’s happening but they won’t explain why. They
 will protect them from it,’ the 65-year-old told the Mail yesterday.

'They won’t contaminate them by taking them out shopping and all that rubbish.

'They won’t be spoilt children, I don’t think that for one minute. And if they are then auntie will knock them into shape.’

Mr Hudspith, 38, said the Bayfords spent their last holiday in a caravan in Cornwall.

'Obviously, the amount of money they 
have won is life-changing in a huge way but their core values as people 
will not change too much,’ he said.

'They always put their children first 
and do not have extravagant tastes. I genuinely believe they will be the
 same people that they have always been.'

PUGH

Mrs Bayford, 40, plans to quit her job
 as a healthcare assistant at Addenbrooke’s Hospital in Cambridge but Mr
 Bayford, 41, is  expected to carry on working.

'Whether he will want to be here every
 day behind the counter is another matter but I am sure he will do at 
some point,' Mr Hudspith said. 'They are working people. Having an 
interest in something is important. They will not just sit around and do
 nothing.'

The Bayfords discovered they had been catapulted into 516th place in the Sunday Times Rich List on Saturday night.

But their wish list is decidedly 
modest. As well as a new home with a high-tech kitchen, Mrs Bayford is 
considering buying an Audi Q7 and her husband wants to visit the 
Canadian Rockies.

They also plan to share their good fortune with a small group of family and friends.

And there could be more happiness for 
the family after the Mail revealed that Mr Bayford and twin brother 
Miles have a half-brother from their father Sidney’s first marriage. The
 brothers were aware of Paul Wilson’s existence but had never been in 
touch.

And Mr Wilson, a 55-year-old college 
manager, has had no contact with his father since the 1960s and had no 
idea he had remarried and started another family.

Miss Beesley yesterday suggested her nephews would 'probably, in time, have a get-together' with their long-lost relative.

'They’re the type of people who might do that,' she said.

Mr Wilson, who has insisted he has no 
interest in his relative’s fortune, said: 'Thanks to the lottery I have 
discovered a whole new branch of my family.'
