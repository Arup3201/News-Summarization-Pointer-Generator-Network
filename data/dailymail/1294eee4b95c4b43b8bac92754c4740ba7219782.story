The chief information security officer from online payment service, PayPal, has predicted that the end of passwords is nigh.

Speaking at the IT conference Interop in Las Vegas on Monday, Michael Barrett said he wants to see a mixture of online passwords with hardware-based identification such as finger print scanning becoming more common.

Barrett also said he thinks the technology won't become popular until large companies adopt it, but believes Apple will lead the way if the technology is added to the iPhone 6.

PayPal's chief information security officer Michael Barrett believes that the end of passwords is nigh. Speaking at the Interop conference in Las Vegas, Barrett said that too many people are using the same passwords across accounts and wants to see a mix of online and physical passwords introduced to increase security

The Worst Passwords of 2012, including their current ranking and any changes from the 2011 list:

1. password (Unchanged)

2. 123456 (Unchanged)

3. 12345678 (Unchanged)

4. abc123 (Up 1)

5. qwerty (Down 1)

6. monkey (Unchanged)

7. letmein (Up 1)

8. dragon (Up 2)

9. 111111 (Up 3)

10. baseball (Up 1)

During the keynote speech, Barrett said: 'Passwords, when used ubiquitously everywhere at Internetscale are starting to fail us.

'Users will pick poor passwords and then they'll reuse them everywhere.

'That has the effect of reducing the security of their most secure account to the security of the least secure place they visit on the internet.'

Barrett wants to see an increase in the amount of physical ID systems being used, such as eye-tracking technology and fingerprint scanners.

And believes that if Apple launches the iPhone 6 with a built-in fingerprint scanner, as is rumoured, the company will lead the way for the technology to become more widespread.

Michael Barrett, the chief information security officer from PayPal, believes passwords are dead and wants to see a mixture of physical technology, such as fingerprint scanners, combined with online passwords. He believes that Apple will launch the iPhone 6 with fingerprint technology last this year

Barrett said: 'It's widely rumored that a large technology provider in Cupertino will come out with a phone later this year that has a fingerprint reader on it.'

'There is going to be a fingerprint enabled phone on the market later this year. Not just one, multiple.'

One organisation that already provides this mix of software and hardware authenticators is Barrett's own Fast IdentityOnline (FIDO).

A FIDO user will have a FIDO Authenticator or token that they chose or was given to them by a vendor such as Apple.

This includes fingerprint scanners or a USB memory drive with a password.

FIDO Authenticators come in two forms: Identification tokens are unique identifiers that can be connected to your internet accounts.

Once they are connected to your account, they will automatically identify you and log you in.

The other form of authenticator is Authentication tokens.

These ask you to complete an action such as entering a password, PIN, of finger swipe each time you want to access your account.

This is known as a two-factor authentication that combines 'something you have', such as the token, with 'something you know', such as a password, or 'something you are', such as your fingerprints.

The system also comes with a browser plug-in that can recognise connected tokens.

Fast IdentityOnline (FIDO) is an authentication company that uses a mix of security software and physical authenticator tokens to make accessing online accounts more secure. This chart shows how the technology works
