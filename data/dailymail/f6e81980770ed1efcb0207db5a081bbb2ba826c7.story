An early blunder by third-choice Hull keeper Eldin Jakupovic and a moment of opportunism from Victor Wanyama were the decisive factors as Southampton maintained their extraordinary start to the season.

Jakupovic failed to deal effectively with a back-pass, hitting it to Wanyama who, in turn, lobbed it back from distance, over the keeper’s head and into the net.

So Southampton go marching on — with 10 wins in their last 11 games in all competitions and playing as solidly at the back as they are threateningly going forward.

Ronald Koeman’s side have not conceded a League goal in more than six hours, or 320 minutes to be exact, and have let in fewer top-flight goals (in total, five; and per game, half) than any other side in England, in any division.

‘And now you’re gonna believe us, we’re gonna win the League!’ sang the 1,479 jubilant Southampton fans in attendance. 

Indeed. Nobody is going to believe them but this has been a wonderful start to the season and this latest victory made the 254-mile journey home much more pleasant for the travelling support.

Koeman was asked about the fans’ singing. ‘Maybe, maybe,’ he said when asked if his side could really win the title, but he did so with a big grin. ‘But no,’ he added. Then: ‘If we continue moving up the table, why not?’

This was Southampton’s third win in eight days following two victories over Stoke, at home in the League last week then away in the Capital One Cup, booking a quarter-final berth in that competition.

‘I’m proud of my players, a third win in a week is not easy,’ Koeman said. ‘I’m surprised a bit by how many points we have, but I’m not surprised by the quality of the team … we work hard on the composition of the team.’

Asked about European aspirations, he added: ‘You never know … but everyone knows we have to work hard every day. The spirit is incredible and we have to keep it.’

His counterpart, Steve Bruce, said: ‘That was a very difficult game for us. Southampton are a very, very good side and it’s no fluke they’re at the top of the division.

‘We weren’t quite there today … it was a great finish from Wanyama, but you make a mistake like that and you’re on your heels.’

Wanyama was one of two changes Koeman made to the side that started against Stoke last Saturday. Wanyama starting in place of Jack Cork in midfield and Shane Long started in place of Sadio Mane.

Wanyama’s all-round play was excellent, as good as it has been since his £12.5 million move from Celtic in summer 2013.

The crowd — including England manager Roy Hodgson — were barely in their seats when the visitors went ahead inside three minutes. If we want to be generous, the goal was not all Jakupovic’s fault. 

The Yugoslavia-born Swiss international would not have been playing without injuries to Allan McGregor and Steve Harper. Jakupovic was then put under some pressure by a backpass from Robbie Brady.

The weight of the ball was not good and Jakupovic was forced to move out of his goal to make sure that he got to it before Graziano Pelle, running the channel to try and pick it up. 

Jakupovic did get there first, but instead of kicking the ball hard and out of play — as would probably have been best — he hoofed it not very hard out of his area — to Wanyama.

The Kenyan had a look up to see Jakupovic well out of position and smashed the ball it first time from about 40 yards into the net.

So the goal was a product of Brady’s poor play, and Wanyama’s skill. But yes, it was still a howler. And yes,
