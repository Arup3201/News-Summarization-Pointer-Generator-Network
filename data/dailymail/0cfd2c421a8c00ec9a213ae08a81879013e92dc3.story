When: Saturday November 8, 2.30pm

Where: Twickenham Stadium, London

What: QBE Series opener

Semesa Rokoduguni trained with his England team-mates on Thursday morning as Stuart Lancaster put his players through their paces ahead of Saturday's QBE Series opener against New Zealand.

Stuart Lancaster is backing the uncapped wing and new father Dave Attwood to rise to the challenge of tackling world champions New Zealand at Twickenham on Saturday.

England have named Rokoduguni on the right wing for the QBE Series opener and his Bath team-mate Attwood takes his place at lock after his fiancee gave birth to their first child on Tuesday.

Fiji-born Rokoduguni, a serving soldier in the British Army with the Royal Scots Dragoon Guards who has seen action in Afghanistan, has been rewarded for an outstanding start to the season at Bath.

And Lancaster expects the 27-year-old to take his chance in the injury-enforced absence of Manu Tuilagi.

'He is very composed and calm,' said Lancaster. 'He's dilligent, he's done his preparation.

'He has been on our radar for a while and there are a lot of stats that say he is topping every category.

'I'm delighted for Roko. Wing is an extremely competitive position, but he has pushed himself forward with his form this season and it's great to be able to give him this opportunity.'

Rokoduguni is one of three uncapped players in the 23 with Bath team-mate Anthony Watson offering back-three cover from the bench and George Kruis of Saracens the second-row replacement.

Lancaster has no qualms about the inclusion of Attwood, one of seven Bath players in the matchday squad, so soon after becoming a dad.

'He's got even more to play for this weekend now,' said Lancaster. 'He's absolutely fine. In fact the biggest worry would be if the baby hadn't arrived yet and if that would have played on his mind.

'He's had an eventful week. He's back with us now and will be ready to go for Saturday.'

Danny Care and Owen Farrell form the half-backs with Farrell chosen despite being restricted to only two starts for Saracens this season because of a thigh strain.

Lancaster said Farrell's performance in training had earned him his place ahead of George Ford.

'George has had a great season as well but Owen has been excellent in training. George will continue to push him and his opportunity will come at some point.'

Lancaster is upbeat about England's prospects against an All Blacks side missing Dan Carter and with Sonny Bill Williams playing at inside centre.

'We are at home against a very high-quality team but we've got belief in our team as well.

'They are strong across the board, very experienced and with world-class players in a lot of positions.

'But it's not dissimilar to the side we played in the summer, the side we played this time last year or two years ago and, on each occasion, we either won or pushed them close.'

England have selected a previously untried centre pairing of Kyle Eastmond - the Aviva Premiership's form player - and Brad Barritt.

Eastmond experienced mixed fortunes during the summer tour to New Zealand, excelling in the first Test only to be replaced at half-time of the third when his defensive frailties were exposed.

Barritt's inclusion at outside centre provides England with an insurance policy as Lancaster views the Saracens midfielder as the best defensive back in the Premiership.

Jonny May of Gloucester fills the left-wing slot despite a disappointing tour of New Zealand which placed his international future in doubt.

England's pack, which has been decimated by injuries to the tight five, picked itself once the respective calf and thigh injuries carried by props David Wilson and Joe Marler cleared up.

Attwood was the next in line to partner Courtney Lawes in the second row after Joe Launchbury was ruled out of the entire autumn schedule with a neck problem.

Billy Vunipola has held off the number eight challenge from Ben Morgan to start in the back row with Chris Robshaw leading the team.

After tackling the All Blacks, England face further autumn appointments with South Africa, Samoa and Australia.
