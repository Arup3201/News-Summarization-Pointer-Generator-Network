Claims that a Tory official used taxpayers' money to fund a gay sex party at £2,500-a-night hotel are to be investigated by Parliament's expenses watchdog.

A senior aide is alleged to have booked out a suite at the lavish Light ApartHotel in central Manchester during a Conservative Party Conference, and used the hook-up app Grindr to invite young men to his rooms.

The figure - who cannot be named for legal reasons - is not an MP, but is claimed to have enjoyed indirect access to taxpayer cash through a research company funded almost by MPs' expenses.

In the wake of the allegations, which were revealed last week in the Mail on Sunday, the Independent Parliamentary Standards Authority (Ipsa), has launched an investigation into the incident.

A spokesman said Ipsa was 'deeply worried' by the claims. Its rules state that public money cannot be used to fund party political activities, such as attending conferences.

The official in question - who is paid £70,000 a year - allegedly booked the hotel suite through an organisation called the Policy Research Unit (PRU). The think tank is mostly funded by the public purse, as Tory MPs pay for its research from their expenses allowance.

A spokesman for the organisation told the Independent: 'Allegations that the PRU has misused public money are
 deeply worrying and pose serious questions for the PRU board to answer.'We
 have received the proper assurances and evidence from all MPs who claim
 through PRU but, in the light of these concerns, we will be contacting 
PRU to seek further assurance about their work and that the claims fall 
within Ipsa’s scheme.'

The gay sex party is alleged to have taken place at the Light ApartHotel, a luxury apartment complex in Manchester where suites cost up to £2,500 a night.

Engineers managed to restore about a quarter of the deleted profiles, but the rest were lost permanently, he claimed.

It is just over half a mile from the Manchester Central conference centre and is popular with footballers and WAGs. The complex can be entered by driving straight into the underground car park, escaping the attentions of the paparazzi.

The official was among a group of Tory aides who stayed there during the conference in 2011. He organised the party using the Grindr app, which enables users to make contact with fellow gay men in the vicinity.

After a series of intimate exchanges with another man, he invited him to a party in his hotel suite. It is alleged that other men were later invited.

Sources told the Mail on Sunday that the official boasted he was a senior figure in the Tory Party.

The source, who has seen the Grindr messages, said: ‘The gist of it was, “I’m up here with the Tory Party and have some great young guys in my suite. We party every night, come and join us.”

‘The other man responded very enthusiastically and said he was also involved in politics so they had lots in common.’

Shortly after the conference, a formal complaint was made to the party by an individual who saw the Grindr exchanges between the named official and the other man, who did not disclose his identity.
