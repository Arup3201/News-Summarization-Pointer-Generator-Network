ABC anchor Elizabeth Vargas has returned to work after completing treatment for alcohol addiction for a second time.

The veteran 20/20 presenter was back in the office Monday, and she is expected to begin hosting the show again Friday.

Vargas, 51, first sought help for her alcohol dependency in early November, admitting in a statement that she was 'dealing with addiction.'

Battling her demons: Vargas, 51, has been off air since October, and the following month she announced that she had completed a second stint in rehab for her alcohol dependency

A friend of the TV personality and mother of two has revealed to New York Post's Page Six that Vargas realized that had not 'conquered' her problem with alcohol the first time around and decided to return to rehab.

An ABC News spokesperson told the paper, 'Everyone is pulling for Elizabeth and looking forward to her return to 20/20.'

The anchor herself has stayed out of the limelight over the past three months.

Her most recent Twitter message was posted in mid-November announcing her return from the treatment facility where she had been staying.

'Hello everyone!  I am home, and so grateful for all your support and well wishes. I am so much better and taking it one day at a time,' she wrote to her 40,000 followers. 

According to the New York Daily News, senior staff at ABC were told last October Vargas was on 'medical leave', but many suspected she was being treated for alcoholism.

'We are proud of the steps Elizabeth has taken and are pulling for her recovery,' an ABC spokesperson said at the time.

Vargas is married to Grammy 
Award-winning musician Marc Cohn, best known for his song Walking In 
Memphis, and the couple have two sons, 10-year-old Zachary and 
seven-year-old Samuel.

Vargas is also stepmother to Maxwell and Emily, Cohn's children from his first marriage.   

In 2005, Cohn was shot in the head during a carjacking attempt in Denver, Colorado.

The musican survived and made a full recovery, but the traumatic event has left its mark on their family.

'Long after the physical wounds are healed, I think my husband's going to really be struggling with the psychological effects of what happened,' Vargas said in an ABC News interview.

Vargas is a well-respected television journalist, getting her start at Chicago's WBBM before joining NBC News in 1993 as a correspondent for Dateline.

She was named co-anchor alongside David Muir of ABC's investigative news program 20/20 in 2004.

The New Jersey native won an Emmy in 1999 for her coverage of the Elian Gonzalez immigration case.
