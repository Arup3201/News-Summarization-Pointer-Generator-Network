Police are hunting for a 40-year-old California man who is suspected of kidnapping a teen girl that he had a 'crush' on after murdering her mother and younger brother.

James Lee DiMaggio is believed to be on the run with Hannah Anderson, 16. The search for Hannah was launched on Sunday after police found the bodies of Hannah's mother, 44-year-old Christina Anderson, and another youngster inside a burned-down rural house near the U.S.-Mexico border in California.

The youngster has not yet been identified but police believe it could be the body of Hannah's 8-year-old brother, Ethan.

DiMaggio was described as being like an uncle to Hannah and Ethan.

But Hannah's friend, Marissa Chavez, said 
Wednesday that DiMaggio had developed a crush on Hannah and told her that he would
 date her if they were the same age.

'He said he had a crush on her, but didn't mean it in an intimate way,' 15-year-old Marissa Chavez told The San Diego Union-Tribune. 'He said, "If I was your age, I'd date you."'

Chavez said she witnessed the 
exchange when DiMaggio was driving them 
home from a high school gymnastics meet. Hannah asked Chavez to join her
 from then on whenever DiMaggio drove her to meets because she was 
uncomfortable with the attention, according to Chavez.

'She was a little creeped out by it. She didn't want to be alone with him,' Chavez said.

She
 also said that DiMaggio took her to Hollywood in late June or early 
July for her birthday, and that he cut the week-long trip short because he was 
upset that Hannah was paying more attention to her phone than to him.

'After that she never responded to his texts and e-mails,' Chavez told the San Diego newspaper.

DiMaggio was in a 'close platonic relationship' with Anderson, a sheriff’s statement said without further explanation.

Brett Anderson, Christina Anderson's husband and father to Hannah and Ethan, flew to San Diego Tuesday to be interviewed by investigators and to plead with DiMaggio to return his daughter safely.

'Jim,
 I can't fathom what you were thinking. The damage is done,' he said 
outside San Diego County Sheriff's Department headquarters.

Addressing Hannah, he said he loves her very much and pleaded, 'if you have a chance, you take it. You run. You'll be found.'

Anderson lives in Tennessee. He moved away from his family a couple months ago for a new job.

DiMaggio was in a 'close platonic relationship' with Anderson, the sheriff’s statement said without further explanation.

DiMaggio is believed to be driving a blue Nissan Versa with California license plate 6WCU986.

He is described as white, 5-feet-9-inches tall, weighing 150 pounds, with brown hair and brown eyes, and is currently clean-shaved without the goatee beard seen in his photo.
