There was little escape for this drug farmer after a police helicopter’s thermal imaging camera detected heat coming from a cannabis factory in his flat which made it glow in the dark. 

Heat-sensitive cameras on board West Midlands Police’s helicopter picked up unusually high temperatures seeping from the walls of the high-rise home in Nechells’ South Tower in Birmingham.

The ‘glowing’ light is a tell-tale sign of cannabis production because the plants require high heat and light to grow.

Staff alerted neighbourhood police colleagues on the ground and when officers raided the address days later they discovered 143 cannabis plants.

Benjamin Edwards, 28, was given a two-year prison sentence suspended for 24 months when he admitted cannabis cultivation at Birmingham Crown Court last Friday.

He was also ordered to attend a three-month drug rehab course, made a subject of a two-year supervision order and told to pay £100 costs.

West Midlands Police Deputy Air Operations Manager Martin Knowles said: 'The crew were heading back from a search in the Solihull area when they noticed a clear heat source at a flat in Nechells.

'Our thermal cameras can detect unusually high temperatures coming from properties several thousand feet away - anyone growing cannabis on a commercial scale, using rows of heat lamps, runs the very real risk their criminality will be rumbled from the skies.'

The den was caught on camera just after 10.30pm on May 2 this year as the helicopter made its way back to Birmingham Airport after providing air support in the search for a wanted man in Acocks Green.

Police found the plants - which had potential to yield drugs with a street value of around £30,000 - scattered throughout the flat which had been converted into a cannabis factory.

The property had been modified to accommodate light, irrigation and ventilation systems.

Birmingham's Cannabis Disposal Team has closed down 399 drug factories so far this year and taken almost £30million worth of drugs off the streets.

Mike Hall, disposal team manager, said: 'We know how much upset drug dealing causes in our communities. 

'It attracts an undesirable element, tends to be linked to wider acquisitive crime and is a real concern, especially for families.

'No-one should be expected to live with drug dealing on their doorstep - we’re responding to community concerns, acting on the information they provide, and shutting down more and more drugs production facilities.'
