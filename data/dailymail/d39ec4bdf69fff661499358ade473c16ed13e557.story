A police spokesman said the Audi had failed to stop for police in a marked car in the nearby town of Scholes, and had made its way to Cleckheaton

The unmarked BMW had been searching for the car in the Clackheaton area when the crash happened at about 3.10am today.

Police watchdog the Independent Police Complaints Commission (IPCC) has been informed and has launched an investigation into the incident.

A West Yorkshire police spokesman said they were unable to say whether the first police car had been pursuing the Audi at the time, because it formed part of the investigation by the IPCC.

They were also unable to answer questions about why the car had been ordered to stop by police, and whether the first car was a marked police car.

A spokesman said officers had been cut from the wreckage following the crash.

He added: 'The Police vehicle was driven into the wall of a building by the 
crash, injuring a male Police Officer and a male Special Constable 
inside. 

'Both were freed from the vehicle and later taken to Leeds 
General Infirmary for treatment to non life threatening injuries.'
