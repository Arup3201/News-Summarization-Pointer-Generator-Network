The compilation of the honours list has always been something of a murky affair. The perception lingers that a nudge here, a wink there and a generous donation to the right account does no harm at all to one's prospects of a knighthood.

Trot along to one of the Prime Minister's barbecues in Buckinghamshire and the chances of the Queen pinning something on your lapel at Buckingham Palace a few months later also appear to improve somewhat.

Civil servants, politicians and bankers pick up gongs for doing little more than their day job, while, according to a report earlier this year by the ­Commons public administration select committee, it still remains the case that not enough 'normal people' are being recognised on the list.

No Sir MoBot: Double Olympic gold medalist Mo Farah will receive a CBE and not a knighthood

But the relationship between sport and honours has always been more straightforward. It is essentially a ­meritocracy, stripped of politicking and intrigue. If you win, you are rewarded. Glories equal honour. ­Medals equal gongs. In fact, we don't want our sports stars to be 'normal' at all.

The trouble this year is they were too extraordinary. The gold rush of a glorious Olympic summer where Team GB collected 29 gold medals led Downing Street to issue curmudgeonly briefings about how there would be an honours 'cutback' even before another 34 golds at the Paralympics.

Faced with the prospect of nearly half the audience at the Sports Personality Of The Year Awards being called Dame This or Sir That, the Prime Minister called a halt. As a result there is no Sir MoBot. No Sir Andy of ­Dunblane. No Dame Jessica of the Steel City, either.

In any other year, this illustrious trio would have been guaranteed the very highest accolades of the land for their inspirational performances.

They not only succeeded in their chosen fields, their golden glow was reflected across the nation as they brought the country together for moments of collective joy and patriotism, the intensity of which has rarely been seen before.

But on this occasion, they have had to drop down a rung or two, 'victims' of our incredible sporting success, if we dare use such a word in this context.

Inconsistent: Paralympian Sarah Storey is a Dame but David Weir is given a CBE instead of a knighthood

When Kelly Holmes took double gold on the track in Athens in 2004, she was made a Dame without argument. When Mo Farah achieved a similar feat in London this summer winning the 5,000m and 10,000m, he was handed a citation for a CBE instead.

Paralympian Sarah Storey is a Dame, but all-­conquering wheelchair athlete David Weir is not named a knight, he has a CBE.

There are only so many knights and dames a nation can accommodate, even on a special Olympic honours list. But it is not a snub to miss out and it would churlish to regard it as such.

Murky affair: Pop along to one of the Prime Ministers barbecues in Buckinghamshire and your chances of getting a gong appear to improve

Some of the sports stars not being called to the Palace this year have long careers ahead and there is time enough for knighthoods, honours and accolades. What might seem like a contradiction now can surely be addressed in lists ahead.

At least cycling has two knights of the road; Sir Dave Brailsford for his pursuit of excellence with the British team and Sir Bradley Wiggins, or Sir Wiggo as he will surely be known, for his historic Tour de France triumph and Olympic gold.

There are two Sirs on the waves as well, with David Tanner, performance director of Britain's rowing team and sailor Ben Ainslie collecting knighthoods.

But being a history-maker is not necessarily enough. When Andy Murray finally landed Britain's first men's Grand Slam tennis title in 76 years at the US Open during an era when men's tennis is as strong as it has ever been, he still admitted it 'would be a little rash' to give him a knighthood. The committee agreed, handing him an OBE.

The idea that he has been denied, though, is preposterous. Murray is 25. To make him Sir Andy at 25 would be premature in the extreme. Fred Perry, Britain's last great men's tennis champion, was never given an honour. However it is certainly a far cry from the list of 2003 when Tim Henman was given an OBE just to 'add interest' to the list.

In truth, no athlete, sportsman or sportswoman competes with these ceremonial honours in mind. The distinction that truly counts is the medal hung around their neck on the podium or the trophy they receive at the climax to a tournament.

Sports stars receive honours enough, and most of them would happily cede their place on the list to a charity worker or a member of the Armed Forces if that were the choice. But as a nation we enjoy having sporting heroes and it is a fine problem to have too many for once.

Who said the honours system was ever consistent, anyway? Want the proof? Some inherit a title because their father was made a Baronet, like Sir Mark Thatcher. And then there's Sir Jimmy Savile. I could go on.
