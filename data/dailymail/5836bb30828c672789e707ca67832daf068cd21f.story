An Iowa teenager smiled in court on Monday after pleading guilty to shooting dead his grandparents with a rifle before kissing their corpses and fleeing.

Isaiah Sweet, 18, agreed to plead guilty to shooting dead Richard Sweet, 55, and Janet Sweet, 62, last year after his grandfather made his life a 'living hell' - and in exchange, all other charges against him were dropped.

He faces life in prison at his sentencing in December but after pleading guilty, he will serve sentences for the murders concurrently. Sweet told the judge in Dubuque on Monday that he understood.

Smile of a killer: Isaiah Sweet, 18, grins as he is escorted by sheriff officers after pleading guilty to shooting dead his grandparents in court in Dubuque, Iowa on Monday

The plea came after the prosecution played a two-hour video of Sweet's interview 
with investigators after he was arrested on May 14, 2012, the Dubuque Times Herald reported.

He explained that he had decided to kill his parents after his grandfather constantly put him down, told him he should kill himself and made the teen's life 'a living hell'.

'[I] walked 
up the stairs... had the earmuffs on and everything, stepped up until I
saw my grandpa's head, boom, pulled the trigger,' Sweet said in the interview. 'Pulled 
the bolt back, shot my grandma twice in the head.

'I went up to 
them, and I broke down and started crying. I told them how much I loved 
them,' he said, adding that he kissed them both. 'I don’t know what's wrong with me.'

In court: He said he understood that he faces a sentence of life in prison as he pleaded guilty on Monday

Anger: Sweet said that he killed his grandparents as his grandfather had made his life a 'living hell'

He sobbed: 'I want to go back so bad.'

Both were found slumped dead on their couch with wounds to the head.

He then jumped in his grandfather's truck from their home in Manchester to Iowa City where he went to parties so he didn't think of the killings.

Sweet told investigators he had tried to kill himself before murdering his grandparents and after their deaths, he tried to commit suicide every night by choking himself until he was caught.

He was arrested three days later after a police chase. In the interview, he told investigators that he wanted police to shoot him when they found him.

Murdered: He shot dead Richard and Janet Sweet, pictured, on their couch in May 2012. He said he had first considered poisoning his grandfather's beer and then beating him with a baseball bat

'They didn’t deserve that,' Sweet said of the killings. 'If anyone in the house deserved that, I did.'

Before pulling the trigger, he said he had considered other methods of how to kill his guardians.

The teen thought about 
poisoning his grandfather's beer. He decided to kill him with a bat but 
couldn't go through with the swing because he didn't want his 
grandparents to feel any pain.

He eventually opted to use his grandfather's rifle.

The tape and guilty plea came on the third day of testimony and had began with Judge Michael Shubatt rejecting a defense lawyer's request for a mistrial.

Defense lawyer Jill Eimermann sought a 
mistrial on Friday when a witness for the prosecution testified that he 
found child pornography on a computer in the family home.

Trial: Sgt. James Hauschild with the Manchester Police Department holds up a piece of a round fired from a rifle from the scene of the crime. Sweet said he used his grandfather's rifle in the murders

Testimony: Investigator Scott Regert gestures how Sweet described pointing and shooting the rifle. After the killings, the teen fled in his grandfather's truck but was found three days later

Shubatt acknowledged defense concerns the jury might think Isaiah Sweet accessed child pornography, but he decided the jury wouldn't put too much weight on the statement.

As Sweet was 17 at the time of the murders, Shubatt ordered a sentencing hearing in which defense attorneys can present evidence to ask the court for a lesser time in prison.

But Shubatt cautioned the teenager that he will still spend a significant amount of time in prison.

His sentencing hearing is set December 18 in Delaware County Circuit Court.
