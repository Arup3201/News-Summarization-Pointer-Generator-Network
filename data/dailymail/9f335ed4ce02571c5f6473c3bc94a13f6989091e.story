Obese and overweight people could be prescribed a fat-busting probiotic bacteria to stop them gaining weight, a new study has revealed.

Scientists found a specific bacterial family passed down form generation to generation was more common in the guts of lean individuals.

Lab tests showed a strain of that bacteria prevented people gaining weight when it was transplanted in mice.

Genetics influence whether we are fat or thin by shaping which types of microbes thrive in our body, the study found.

The breakthrough could lead to personalised probiotic therapies to reduce the risk of obesity-related diseases on an individual's genetic make-up. 

Associate Professor Ruth Ley at the Department of Molecular Biology and Genetics of Cornell University said: 'Up until now, variation in the abundances of gut microbes has been explained by diet, the environment, lifestyle, and health.

'This is the first study to firmly establish that certain types of gut microbes are heritable - that their variation across a population is in part due to host genotype variation, not just environmental influences.'

Both genetic variation and the composition of gut microbes have previously been linked to diabetes, high blood pressure and obesity, putting sufferers at greater risk of heart disease, stroke and other conditions affecting blood vessels.

Despite these common links. the relationship between genetic variation and the diversity of gut microbes has been difficult to establish.

Past studies of twins failed to reveal an effect of genetic variation on the diversity of gut microbes.

The Cornell University researchers suspected past studies included too few pairs of twins.

As a result they sequenced the genes of microbes found in stool samples from 416 pairs of twins.

They found an abundance of specific types of microbes were more similar in identical twins, who are genetically the same, than in non-identical pairs no more similar than ordinary siblings, other than sharing environmental influences in the womb.

The findings demonstrated that human genes influence the composition of gut microbes.

The type of bacteria whose abundance was most heavily influenced by human genetics was a recently identified family called christensenellaceae.

Members of the health-promoting bacterial family were more abundant in lean individuals, than those who were obese.

Mice that were then treated with this specific bacteria strain gained less weight than those that were not treated with the microbes.

The team believe their findings could pave the way for a microbe that prevents obesity in humans. 

Prof Ley said: 'Our results showing that bacterial abundances run in families may be useful for disease risk prediction.

'The microbiome is also an attractive target for therapeutic manipulation. By understanding the nature of our association with these health-associated bacteria, we could eventually exploit them to promote health.' 

The study was published in the journal Cell.
