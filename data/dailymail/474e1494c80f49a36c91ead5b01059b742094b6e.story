Arsene Wenger has confirmed he will be active in the January transfer window as he looks to bolster his injury-hit squad.

Arsenal's problems mounted this week after losing midfielders Mikel Arteta and Jack Wilshere.

In total, Wenger has up to eleven injured players going into Saturday's clash against West Brom.

Arsenal have nine players out ahead of their trip to play West Brom on Saturday, Arsene Wenger confirms 

‘It was a very committed game and we have given a lot physically in the last two games,’ said Wenger reflecting on the Borussia Dortmund victory on Wednesday.

‘Szczesny has not practised yet at all. Arteta is out for sure of course and I think Sanogo has problems as well because I had to take him off. We have a few other players that we have to check.’

Sportsmail revealed this morning that the Arsenal board will make more money available than the original £20million in January to help Wenger deal with their growing injury crisis. 

‘January might be a month when we have nearly everybody back because (Laurent) Koscielny is back in the squad, (Mathieu) Debuchy will be back I think in two weeks,’ added Wenger.

‘We have gone through a period where we are very short but we discovered as well that players have learnt their job well in the centre back position, like (Nacho) Monreal and he is doing very well now. In January we will of course try to get at least one body in,’ admitted Wenger

Victory over Borussia Dortmund in the Champions League ensured Arsenal qualified for the last 16, responding to a frustrating 2-1 defeat by Manchester United last weekend.

‘It was a big game of a very, very high intensity and I think we had an outstanding performance. 

It allows us to qualify for the 15th successive year in the last 16 in Europe.

‘We’re the only team who has done that and we are, of course, very proud of that consistency. 

'It allows us to concentrate on our last game and focus on finishing top of the group. 

'It looks very unlikely because Dortmund play at home against Anderlecht so they will have a good chance of winning the game.’

Germany forward Podolski shares a joke with Aaron Ramsey during training with the Gunners

Germany forward Lukas Podolski has publicly admitted his frustration at the lack of playing opportunities at Arsenal but Wenger insists the 29-year-old will remain at Arsenal and praised his attitude:

'I have good connections with Lukas and we talk about the situation. He faces big competition on the flanks and basically that is the consequence of him not getting the number of games that he wants.

'I think he has an outstanding attitude and he works very hard in training. His job is that: just be ready when you are needed for the club and he does that very well.'

Having navigated a way through in the Champions League, Arsenal return to their stuttering Premier League campaign at West Brom on Saturday.

‘It's a team that has a good technical level and maturity in their team. They produce good quality going forward through the flanks. They get top-quality crosses in and they are very good on set pieces as well,’ said Wenger.

‘All these things we want to control, but first express the quality of our game and continue to have the same dynamic in our game.’
