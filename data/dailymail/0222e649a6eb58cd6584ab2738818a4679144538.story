Flight 666 to 'HEL' on Friday the 13th ought to be virtually empty with superstitious travellers quietly booking the next flight.

But passengers on AY666 to Helsinki in Finland appeared not to be too concerned as the plane was almost full when it took off from Copenhagen today.

Even pilots on board the Airbus were sharing a joke about the unlucky numbers.

Friday the 13th: Flight AY666 to Helsinki in Finland from Copenhagen was almost full today

'It has been quite a joke among the pilots,' said pilot Juha-Pekka Keidasto before flying the Airbus A320 from Copenhagen in Denmark to Helsinki.

'I'm not a superstitious man. It's only a coincidence for me.'

The daily flight AY666 from Copenhagen to Helsinki falls on Friday the 13th twice in 2013.

While Friday the 13th is considered bad luck in many countries, and the number 666 also has strong negative biblical associations, fears attached to number 13 go back only about 100 years in the North.

Pure HEL? The Finnish capital of Helsinki in high season

Some airlines, such as Scandinavian Airlines, do take such fears 13 seriously. The airline does not have a row 13 on board.

Meanwhile, Finnair and other regional carriers such as Norwegian and Estonian Air keep the 'unlucky' row 13.

The number 13 said to represent disorder: There were 12 apostles in the Bible and there are 12 hours in a day, and 12 months in the calendar.

But passengers on flight 666 to 'HEL' should have had a calm flight over the Baltic at this time of year.

'It's hopefully smooth skies,' Keidasto said on Guardian online. 'And if there's some passenger who is anxious about this 666, our cabin crew is always happy to help them.'

The flight later landed safely.
