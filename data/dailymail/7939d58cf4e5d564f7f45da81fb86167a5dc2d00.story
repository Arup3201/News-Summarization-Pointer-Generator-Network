A former Stanford University student was mistakenly suspected as a terrorist and placed on the government's 'no-fly' list for nine years because an FBI agent checked the wrong box on her form.

Rahinah Ibrahim, 48, an architect and scholar, is finally allowed to return to the United States after fighting to clear her name since 2005.

In January of that year, Ibrahim was arrested and detained for two hours at San Francisco Airport as she boarded a flight to her native Malaysia with her 14-year-old daughter.

TSA officers told her she was a terrorist watch-list, but then said it was a mistake and that she was clear to fly, reports The San Francisco Chronicle.

When she tried to return from Malaysia two months later, she was told that her student visa had been revoked under a terrorism law.

Ibrahim and her daughter were deported back to Malaysia, where they are believed to have remained since.

U.S. District Judge William Aslup of San Francisco presided over Ibrahim's trial, which was the first-ever challenge to the no-fly list and held behind behind closed doors because of the government's insistence on secrecy.

On Thursday Alsup released most of his 38-page ruling.

He found that the government had violated Ibrahim’s rights, has admitted that she poses no threat to national security and must allow her to apply for re-entry to the U.S.

But he didn’t order her readmitted and said such decisions are within the government’s discretion.

Alsup said the reason for the initial mistake was that FBI special agent Kevin Kelly, who was investigating Ibrahim for reasons the government won’t disclose, had 'misunderstood the directions' on a government form and 'checked the wrong boxes' — ignoring written instructions that she should not be placed on the no-fly list, according to The Chronicle.

Alsup didn’t say what boxes Kelly was supposed to check or why.

Where it all started: Rahinah Ibrahim was flying from San Francisco International to Malaysia with her daughter in January 2005 when the problem first started. She was arrested and detained for two hours

'This was no minor human error but an error with palpable impact, leading to the humiliation, cuffing, and incarceration of an innocent and incapacitated air traveler,' Alsup said, noting that Ibrahim was then using a wheelchair after undergoing surgery.

'Whether true or not, she reasonably suspects that (her current travel restrictions) are traceable to the original wrong that placed her on the no-fly list.'

The judge said the U.S. government must clear up Ibrahim’s records and tell her whether she is back on the terrorist watch-list.

But he said the government still has the authority to deny a visa to Ibrahim, after reviewing her forthcoming application, and there’s not much that the courts could do about it.

Ibrahim is now a professor and dean of a college of design and architecture in Malaysia.
