If you’ve over-indulged this summer, don’t despair – because it is possible to be fat and fit.

Doctors say being overweight will not necessarily send people to an early grave because such a thing as ‘healthy obesity’ exists.

In fact, up to one in four of those labelled obese are lucky enough to be fat and fit. They are physically fit, have normal blood pressure and process sugar easily, despite their generous proportions.

Celebrities including Nigella Lawson (left) and Lisa Riley (right) have long said that it possible to carry extra weight and still be fit. Researchers now believe this is true, defining it as 'metabolically healthy obesity'

Studies show that ‘sufferers’ of healthy obesity have a lower risk of various ills than others who are similarly overweight.

One
 15-year-long Italian study found that the ‘healthy obese’ were no more 
likely to develop heart disease or cancer – or die at any given time – 
than those of normal weight.

In
 other studies, being fat and fit cut the risk of ill health, even if it
 did not completely remove it. The figures come from German experts who 
trawled years of research from around the world into the topic.

Their
 acknowledgement will no doubt be welcome news for the likes of cook 
Nigella Lawson and singer Adele, who have long argued it is possible to 
be fat and fit.

Writing in a
 medical journal published by the respected Lancet group, the medics 
said accurately identifying those who are fat and fit would cut the bill
 for obesity treatment.

Adele said she would only lose weight if it affected her health and so far, she said, it hasn't

Gastric
 bypass and banding operations cost taxpayers up to £85million a year, 
as growing numbers of people become hugely overweight.

Targeting
 treatment to those who would benefit the most could ensure taxpayers’ 
money is best spent. The researchers said: ‘Potentially scarce resources
 can be more effectively tailored … Some prevention and treatment 
strategies can be very expensive and time-consuming.’

Genes
 are thought to be key, but working out why some of our  bodies resist 
the toll of excess weight could also lead to treatments to improve the 
health of the obese who are not fortunate enough to fall into the 
healthy category. Doctors normally gauge whether a patient’s size is a 
health concern by using their weight and height  to calculate their body
 mass index, or BMI.

But 
relying on BMI is controversial, as it does not distinguish between 
muscle and fat, meaning some athletes are classified as obese.

The
 German researchers said using BMI alone was ‘insufficient’ and other 
factors such as waist size, blood pressure and where fat is stored in 
the body needed to be taken into account.

But
 much more research is needed before any formula is ready for use in 
doctor’s surgeries. And in the meantime, the researchers say that the 
obese should still think about losing weight.

The
 team from the German Institute of Human Nutrition and the University of
 Tubingen said: ‘Prevention of obesity through healthy diet and physical
 activity should be widely promoted.’

Writing
 in the Lancet Diabetes & Endocrinology journal, they warned that 
not everyone who is ‘healthy obese’ will stay that way.

Dr
 Ian Campbell, a GP and medical director of charity Weight Concern, said
 it made ‘perfect sense’ that some people could be fat but healthy. But 
he warned: ‘The science is not yet precise. There is always a risk that 
you will develop problems later.’

Most people - including the medical community - equate lower weight with better health, but researchers say there is such a thing as 'healthy obesity'

@highlight

Said BMI is too crude a tool to use when assessing someone's health

@highlight

They believe concept should be more clearly defined so that overweight people at a higher risk of disease can get the treatment they need

@highlight

But added that overweight people should attempt to lose weight as they are still at higher risk of disease in the long-term
