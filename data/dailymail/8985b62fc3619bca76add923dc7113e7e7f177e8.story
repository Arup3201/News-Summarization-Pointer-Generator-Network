Footage has emerged of an attempted arrest gone wrong after officers were called to a street in south Melbourne.

At the weekend police responded to complaints of young teenagers riding around on motorbikes at Hastings, a suburb of the Mornington Peninsula about 75 kilometres south of Melbourne's CBD.

A group of boys were allegedly driving trail bikes in a dangerous matter, and others apparently threw objects at police when they arrived.

A Melbourne teenager has accused a police officer of using excessive force during an attempted arrest

One senior constable attempted to arrest a 14-year-old boy, but the teenager claims the officer used excessive force during the ordeal and fled the scene.

'Well he walked up to me and he grabbed me off my motorbike by the ear and he dragged me over', alleged victim Beau Howroyd told Seven News.

Video shows the officer trying to get Beau - who is kicking and screaming - into the police car.

A friend of the teen, identified as Shaun Lyndon, then appears to grab his mate back from the police as another officer gets involved in the struggle.

A tug-of-war of sorts then takes place, and the officer can be heard telling Sean: 'Let him go. He's in my custody let him go.'

The pair then ran from the officers and Shaun told the program the police were 'slinging him (Beau) around like a little rag doll.'

Police are yet to speak to Beau over the incident, and earlier this month the 14-year-old was fined for riding a motorbike without a helmet.

A criminal investigation is said to be underway but not one into police conduct.

According to Vic Roads in Victoria powered two-wheel vehicle riders account for 15 percent of all deaths and serious injuries on the state's roads, despite making up less than five percent of registered vehicles.

Dirt bikes can be ridden on private property in most states of Australia without being registered or licenced but laws differ when they are driven on public roads.
