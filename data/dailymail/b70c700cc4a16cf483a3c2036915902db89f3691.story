Suspected DUI: Edmond Gulley, 32, was discovered asleep at the wheel at a McDonald's drive-thru with nine children in the back seat 

A Kansas dad was arrested for a DUI early on Monday morning after police found him sleeping in an SUV at a McDonald's drive-thru with nine children in the back seat.

Edmond Gulley, 32, was allegedly drunk driving with six of his children and three of his nieces and nephews when he fell asleep at the wheel at the McDonald's drive-thru in Wichita.

None of the children whose ages ranged from 5 months to 12-years-old were injured.

Police responded when a woman called 911 because she saw Gulley sleeping in the car at 12:30am on Monday morning. She called police to check on Gulley's welfare.

DailyMail.com spoke with Lt. James Espinoza of the Wichita Police Department who said that Gulley was a, 'extremely uncooperative individual' who refused to be tested for substances when police arrived and was arrested.

Gulley did not provide a statement. 

Gulley was also booked on suspicion of child endangerment but he has not yet been charged.

Espinoza said that Gulley's children along with his nieces and nephews were released safely to their mothers.

He said that Gulley fathered children with different mothers but wasn't certain how many. The children were released to their mothers.

Kansas.com reports that Gulley's license has been revoked several times since 1998.

'We're very fortunate that a citizen took the time to call 911 for not only the children in the vehicle but the driver,' said police Lt. James Espinoza.

'We have some concerns about the welfare of the children,' Espinoza said to DailyMail.com.

Espinoza said he couldn't remember the last time he saw so many children in one vehicle with a driver suspected of drinking.
