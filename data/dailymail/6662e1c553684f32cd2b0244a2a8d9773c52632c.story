Accusing: Christopher Salmon said the Plebgate affair was 'uncomfortably close to a police conspiracy'

An elected Crime Commissioner has accused Britain’s police forces of being ‘feral.’

Christopher Salmon has waded into the Plebgate row by saying that the scandal that led Chief Whip Andrew Mitchell to resign ‘appears uncomfortably close to a police conspiracy’.

Mr Salmon, the Police and Crime Commissioner for Dyfed Powys, said: ‘The culture around them  [police forces] is too closed, too defensive, too politicised and, in some cases, feral.

‘In our ancient democracy, an elected Minister has had his career ruined by what appears uncomfortably close to a police conspiracy. It doesn’t get much more serious.’

He added: ‘For the sake of all those dedicated officers who wince every time they read a Plebgate headline, we must break open that culture. That requires greater transparency and fresh leadership.’

Mr Salmon’s comments came as it emerged that a senior police officer blocked disciplinary action against three officers who forced Mr Mitchell to resign, that an officer who investigated them will appear before MPs, and that a review of how the Met police handled the Plebgate affair has not been made public.

Mr Mitchell was forced to resign after an argument with officers at Downing Street who refused to let him ride his bike through its gates. Mr Mitchell was accused of calling the officers ‘f***ing plebs’ – a claim he has always denied.

Mr Salmon’s comments came as it emerged:

The Crown Prosecution Service is considering whether to charge five of the officers involved after they were arrested on suspicion of misconduct in public office and unauthorised disclosure to the media.

Mr Salmon, 35 - an Oxford-educated former Army officer who served in Kosovo and Iraq before becoming a businessman - made his comments after a week-long row between the chief constables of West Mercia, Staffordshire and West Midlands, and the watchdog, the Independent Police Complaints Commission.

The IPCC has accused the chief constables of refusing to discipline three officers - Inspector Ken MacKaill, Detective Sergeant Stuart Hinton and Sergeant Chris Jones - who held a meeting with Mr Mitchell at his Sutton Coldfield constituency and then allegedly lied about what he had said to force him to resign.

West Mercia Police launched an investigation helped by Warwickshire Police and West Midlands Police, and supervised by the IPCC.

Last week, IPCC deputy chief Deborah 
Glass revealed that the West Mercia report first recommended the three 
officers should be disciplined, but a later version said they should 
not.

The IPCC then ordered West Mercia to discipline the officers but it was ignored.

The Mail on Sunday has established that the Deputy Chief Constable of West Mercia, Simon Chesterman, blocked the disciplinary action.

The row is likely to escalate this week as the three chief constables - David Shaw of West Mercia; Andy Parker of Warwickshire and Chris Sims of West Midlands - face the Home Affairs Select Committee.

This weekend it emerged that a church-going policeman, Inspector Jeremy Reakes-Williams, wrote the West Mercia report, recommending disciplinary action.

But a month later, his recommendation was changed. He has also been ordered to appear before the Committee.

Separately, this newspaper has established that Met chief Sir Bernard Hogan-Howe ordered Greater Manchester Police to conduct a review into its initial handling of Plebgate.

The probe was completed in June, but Scotland Yard has refused to make it public even though Sir Bernard said the review was ordered to create ‘more openness’.

Last night a Met spokesman said: ‘We are not prepared to comment on the review in any detail at this time.’

Dominic Raab, the Tory MP for Esher and Walton, said: ‘The danger in not releasing this information is that it will fuel fears  of another level of cover-up.’
