Physicists at the Large Hadron Collider are to 'turn up' the beams of the enormous machine to a higher beam energy for a last-ditch hunt for the Higgs boson, a theoretical particle which would change physics.

CERN will turn up the LHC's beam energy to 4 TeVs, 0.5 TeV higher than last year, and run the particle accelerator until November.

The physicists have one year to complete their experiments before the LHC shuts down for 20 months to upgrade its beam to an even higher energy of 7 TeV.

Physicists are to turn up the energies of the LHC for 2012 - the particle accelerator will operate at a beam energy of 4 TeVs, higher than 2011 or 2010

'When we started operating the LHC for physics in 2010, we chose the 
lowest safe beam energy consistent with the physics we wanted to do,' 
said CERN’s Director for Accelerators and Technology, Steve Myers.

'Two 
good years of operational experience with beam and many additional 
measurements made during 2011 give us the confidence to safely move up a
 notch, and thereby extend the physics reach of the experiments before 
we go into the LHC’s first long shutdown.'

'By the time the LHC goes into its first long stop at the end of this 
year, we will either know that a Higgs particle exists or have ruled out
 the existence of a Standard Model Higgs,' said CERN’s Research 
Director, Sergio Bertolucci.

'Either would be a major advance in our 
exploration of nature, bringing us closer to understanding how the 
fundamental particles acquire their mass, and marking the beginning of a
 new chapter in particle physics.'

The LHC will shut down for 20 months at the end of 2012 to upgrade the machine to even higher energies

The scientists aim to deliver the maximum possible amount of data in 2012 before the LHC goes into a long shutdown.

The data target for 2012 is  three times higher than in 2011.

The LHC’s excellent performance in 2010 and 2011 has brought tantalising hints of new physics, notably narrowing the range of masses available to the Higgs particle to a window of just 16 GeV.

Within this window, both the ATLAS and CMS experiments have seen hints that a Higgs might exist in the mass range 124-126 GeV.

However, to turn those hints into a discovery, or to rule out the Standard Model Higgs particle altogether, requires one more year’s worth of data.

The schedule announced today foresees beams back in the LHC next month, and running through to November.
