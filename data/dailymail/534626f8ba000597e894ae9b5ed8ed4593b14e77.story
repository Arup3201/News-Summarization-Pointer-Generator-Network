Billy Joel gave some Long Island elemtary school singers the shock of their young lives when he showed up to their concert tribute to his music on Wednesday.

Kindergarten, first and second-graders at Glen Cove, New York's Deasy Elementary were all set to perform their The River of Dreams: A Billy Joel Tribute concert when the Piano Man himself rolled up on his motorcycle.

Minutes before showtime, the news spread. Thankfully, Joel was thoughtful enough to sit near the back so as not to make anyone too nervous.

Surprise! Legendary performer Billy Joel showed up to a elementary performance tribute to him on Wednesday, giving the kids the shock of their young lives

Joel lives just ten minutes from the school, so the principal Nomi Rosen thought why not send him an invite.

'We invited Billy Joel on a lark, but we didn't expect him to come. It was totally thrilling,' Rosen told Newsday. 'We were all beside ourselves.'

'I found out two minutes before the concert started that he was here and it totally freaked me out,' said concert director Rosita Mallo. 'My nerves went sky-high.'

The concert showcased the boys' and girls' vocal talents 15 songs that spanned Joel's career.

Gratitude: Parents, organizers and especially the kindergarten through second graders were thrilled when the Piano Man himself came to enjoy their show

'This was a very welcomed surprise. It gave the kids extra energy to perform,' said Mallo.

After he heard the 15-song tribute, he was inundated by autograph requests, which led to his swift exit.

However, the kids get to live the rest of their lives knowing Billy Joel was in the audience that day.

'For a Long Islander, that's a big deal,' said Kim Velentzas, who was in the audience to see her son perform.
