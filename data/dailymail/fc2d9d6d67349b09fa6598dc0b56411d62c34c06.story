A physician from Kansas recovering from a shark attack in Hawaii has described the terrifying moment the underwater beast seemed to appear in front of him out of nowhere.

Ken Grasing, his wife and two sons had just finished snorkeling off Hapuna Beach State Park on the Big Island on the Big Island of Hawaii when a 'black cloud appeared' in the water on Wednesday.

'The shape moved toward me quickly and it materialized into a ten- to 12-foot tiger shark,' Grasing, 58, said as he recovered at Queen's Medical Center in Honolulu. 

Ken Grasing, from Overland Park, Kansas, was on vacation in Hawaii when he was attacked by a ten- to 12ft tiger shark

In about five-foot-deep water, Grasing saw a tiger shark, like the one pictured above, swimming around him. It bit into his left arm before Grasing hit it on the side of its head (file photo)

The attack happened in about five-foot-deep water and there were other people around the area, according to CNN. 

He said it 'happened very rapidly' and that the shark bit his left hand before moving past him. At that point he struck it on the side of the head with his right hand. 

'The shark then swam around me, stayed in the area, and I stood there just yelling. It was quite the dramatic moment,' he told CNN. 'My two boys were with me in the water and I was very concerned that the shark would attack them.' 

The shark continued to cruise just outside the surf line at Hapuna an hour after the attack. A Hawaii County Fire Department helicopter tracked the animal and confirmed seeing stripes on the shark's body. 

Grasing was hospitalized but is expected to make a full recovery. He suffered severe cuts on his left forearm and had an injury on his left leg, likely from being scraped by a shark fin. 

He's unsure if he'll ever go snorkeling after the shark attack.

'This is a magnificent animal swimming with great speed and power. I was really at its mercy, and if it had mind to do anything more, that would have been the end of me,' he said. 

He said he made the quick decision to hit the shark on the side of the head because there were 'a lot of teeth that are sharp' and it was 'moving very fast'.

And fortunately for Grasing, 'it didn't like what it tasted' when it bit him, so it moved away.  

The tiger shark can reach up to 16ft long and is considered to be Hawaii's most dangerous shark. There are about 40 species of sharks in Hawaii.

Tiger sharks are often considered to be 'the garbage can of the sea', according to CNN, because they eat a wide variety of prey. 

In 2014, there were six shark attacks in Hawaii, though none of them were fatal, according to the state's shark information website. 

This was Grasing's third trip to Hawaii - the family was celebrating his oldest son's high school graduation, according to West Hawaii Today. 

He said despite the attack, it was still 'a great day of snorkeling' where the family in which they saw an octopus and plenty of fish.
