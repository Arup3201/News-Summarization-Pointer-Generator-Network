The Delaware clinic in which 'house of horrors' abortion doctor Kermit Gosnell performed late-term terminations is being turned into an emergency food and support center for poor families.

Lutheran Community Services purchased the building in Wilmington, formerly known as Atlantic Women’s Medical Services, last year to serve as its new headquarters. The Christian group knew of the building's gruesome history.

'It's going to be a place of hope and life,' executive director Jean Warren told FoxNews.com.

Unrepentant: Abortion doctor Kermit Gosnell was sentenced to life behind bars after being found guilty last year

Gosnell, a Philadelphia doctor sentenced to life in prison, once practiced at the Delaware facility.

According to the Philadelphia Grand Jury report, Gosnell would induce late-term abortions at the Delaware clinic - where they were illegal - and finish them off at his west Philadelphia clinic, the Women's Medical Society.

None of the charges Gosnell, 73, was ultimately convicted of stemmed from his actions at the Delaware facility.

In May last year, Gosnell was found guilty of murdering three babies born alive.

A jury also declared him guilty of involuntary manslaughter in the drug overdose death of a 41-year-old patient, Karnamaya Mongar.

Investigators described his Philadelphia clinic as a chaotic 'house of horrors', replete with fetal remains in the staff refrigerator, specimen jars of severed feet in his office and dirty medical instruments in the surgery rooms.

Authorities in Pennsylvania had failed to conduct routine inspections of all its abortion clinics for 15 years by the time Gosnell's facility was raided as part of a prescription drug investigation.

Gosnell later pleaded guilty in federal court to running a pill mill for addicts and drug dealers.

In the scandal's aftermath, two top state health officials were fired, and the state imposed tougher rules for clinics.

Former clinic employees testified that Gosnell routinely performed illegal abortions past Pennsylvania's 24-week limit.

They said that Gosnell delivered babies who were still moving and that he and his assistants killed them by snipping their spines with scissors.

Gosnell's own lawyers said perhaps the doctor's biggest transgression may have been hiring high school dropouts and other unqualified people to act as doctors.

The employees performed abortions, administered anesthesia and monitored high-risk patients.

Gosnell was spared the death penalty after striking a plea deal.

Instead, he will serve his life sentences consecutively and without parole after giving up his right to appeal.

Four former clinic employees pleaded guilty to murder and four more to other charges. The co-defendants included Gosnell's wife, a cosmetologist who helped perform abortions.

Despite the life sentence, Gosnell was acquitted in the deaths of four other babies.

Following Gosnell’s sentencing, the case’s gag order was lifted, allowing Philadelphia Police crime scene investigator John Taggart to expose the atrocities he had witnessed inside the Philadelphia clinic.

Taggart said corpses of dead babies and body parts were found everywhere, including in fridges and cabinets, at the 3801 Lancaster Avenue facility.

‘The smells were just unbearable,’ Taggart told NBC 10. ‘You could tell there was death somewhere.’

Investigators had revealed in court how baby body parts would clog toilets after women delivered them in stalls inside the clinic, but Taggart also said that remains were uncovered in the break room sink.

‘They were shoving body parts down the 
garbage disposal,’ Taggart said. ‘To the point where they plunged it one
 day and an arm popped out on Lancaster Avenue.’

Prosecutors say 
Gosnell would deliver some babies alive, despite giving them medication 
in utero meant to stop their heart. The doctor and his staff would then 
snip their necks with scissors to ensure death.

Investigators also 
visited Gosnell’s shore home in Brigantine, N.J. to search for the 
remains of unaccounted fetuses. Neither they nor New Jersey authorities
 who sent a dive team into the bay were able to locate any remains.

‘I
 believe they are either buried out there or I don’t know where they 
are. We’ve looked, we’ve looked for three years,’ Taggart said.

Gosnell has been in jail since his January 2011 arrest.

The business apparently made Gosnell a fortune over the 30 years he was carrying out abortions.

Authorities said that the medical practice netted him about $1.8 million a year, and found $250,000 hidden in a bedroom when they searched one of his numerous properties.
