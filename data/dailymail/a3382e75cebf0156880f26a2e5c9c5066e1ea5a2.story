Per Sandberg has caused outrage in the French media with his comments

A leading Norwegian MP has called for French people to be banned from visiting his country because they are 'notorious criminals'.

Per Sandberg - who is head of parliament's judicial affairs committee - said large groups of tourists from France, Romania and Bulgaria should be stopped at the border.

The deputy leader of the main opposition Progress Party said: 'We need immediate measures to stop the influx of begging and crime.

'At the borders, police can under existing laws stop organised groups of Romanians, Bulgarians or French because we know from experience that these people disrupt the peace.'

And he added in the statement posted online: 'It has also been proven that they are notorious for engaging in criminal activities.'

The remarks have caused outrage in the French media, where France Info news said: 'We French are certainly not more criminally inclined than anyone else.

'This man is an idiot in ski boots. Why pick on us?'

It is not the first time Mr Sandberg has stirred up controversy with his extreme views.

In 1999, he proposed that the Norwegian government should be able to deport foreigners if their children committed crimes.

In 2006, he said large areas of Norway could be under the jurisdiction of Islamic Sharia Law.

Norway is not a member of the European Union, but has signed up to the Schengen Agreement which allows the free movement of most Europeans - including the French - across its borders.
