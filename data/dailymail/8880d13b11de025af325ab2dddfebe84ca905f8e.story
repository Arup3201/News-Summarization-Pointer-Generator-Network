'Sesame Street' is brought to you by the letter 'P' - for Prison.

The children's educational show is about to tackle the problem of incarceration head on and they've created a new Muppet, Alex, whose dad is in jail.

He is the first character to join the likes of Big Bird, Oscar the Grouch, and Elmo, who will teach young children about how to cope when their mom or dad is 
incarcerated.

One in 28 children in the United States now has a parent behind bars - more than the number of kids with a parent who is deployed.

Missing dad: Alex is part of a Sesame Workshop online took kit aimed to help children with a parent behind bars understand and cope with the situation

The Sesame Workshop says it created 
the 'Little Children, Big Challenges: Incarceration' initiative, an 
online tool kit intended to help kids with a parent in prison find 
support and comfort, and provide families with strategies and tips to 
talk to their children about incarceration.

Alex is blue-haired and green-nosed and he wears a hoodie. When he talks about his dad, he sounds upset.

'I just miss him so much,' he tells a friend. 'I usually don’t want people to know about my Dad.'

'Coming from a Muppet, it’s almost another child telling their story to the children,' said Jeanette Betancourt, vice president of outreach and educational practices at the Sesame Workshop.

Alex will not be part of the regular cast on 'Sesame Street,' but he’s playing a central role in the online tool kit.

A short documentary will be distributed this week to therapists' offices, schools and prisons.

Educational: 'Sesame Street' characters have tackled all sorts of problem in the past but this is the first time the problem of parents in jail has been addressed

The project and its unusual subject matter have garnered a lot of attention, with some observers calling it a sign of the times.

'Congratulations, America, on making it almost normal to have a parent in prison or jail,' wrote a columnist on Reason.com.

Organizers say the campaign is aimed at helping kids aged three to eight in the U.S., which has the highest incarceration rate in the world.

A toolkit of resources has been uploaded onto the Sesame Street website including videos, printable brochures, eBooks and apps.

‘The incarceration of a loved one can be very overwhelming for both children and caregivers,’ reads a message on the website. ‘Here are some tools to help you with the changes your child is going through.’

The kit includes a video showing two Muppets - Abby the fairy and lovable monster Rosita - dealing with a Muppet boy who shamefully admits that his father can't help him build a toy car because he’s in jail.

Then a woman called Sofia tells the boy that she knows what he’s going through because her dad was in jail when she was his age.

As well as the online resources, information packs will be distributed to schools, community centers and jails

The online materials include a variety of 'tips¿ for how to prepare young child for visiting a parent in prison

The online materials include a variety of 'tips’ for how to prepare young child for visiting a parent in prison.

'Before you visit your incarcerated loved one, let your child know some of the things she can expect to happen. For instance, "We won’t be able to sit in the same room with Mommy, but we can see her through a window and read a story together."'

Another tip focuses on explaining to a child how they might explain the situation to other people.

'When explaining where an incarcerated parent is, you can say, "Daddy is in a place called prison (or jail) for a while. Grownups sometimes go to prison when they break a rule called a law."'

‘Sesame Street' receives funding from both the federal budget and private sponsors although in this particular program the website lists a series 
of charitable foundations and corporate sponsors including BAE Systems.
