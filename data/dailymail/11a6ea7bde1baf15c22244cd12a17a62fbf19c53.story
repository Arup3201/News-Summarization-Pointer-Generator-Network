A father-of-three died when it took tour guides more than nine hours to get him to hospital after a motorbike crash in Mongolia, an inquest heard.

Andrew Grennan, 43, suffered horrendous internal injuries after his Yamaha hit a pothole during a motorcycle holiday on June 7 this year.

An inquest was told that Mr Grennan, a gas engineer from Walsall, was taken the 37 miles to a village and then to a town hospital at an average speed of just 4mph along the edge of the Gobi.

Dr Caroline Taylor, who was providing back-up medical assistance, said she believed that Mr Grennan had a number of fractures and, because of his low blood pressure, an internal injury.

On arrival at hospital at Altai at about 5pm, an air medical evacuation was considered but a CT scan revealed that he had a ruptured spleen and he was rushed into surgery to stem the bleeding.

During the operation doctors discovered a staggering six pints of blood had collected in his abdomen.

Tragically, the 'competent' motorcyclist failed to regain consciousness and was pronounced dead the following morning.

Birmingham Coroner's Court heard today the motorcycle tour was organised by Nick Sanders Expeditions.

Nick Sanders is a record-breaking motorcyclist and author who has travelled the world on his bike seven times.

Mr Sanders, who has been organising trips since 1999, said 'These challenges are difficult. We were in the middle of the Gobi desert. There is only so much that anybody can do. The best thing to be is self-sufficient, which we were.'

Stephen James was one of a group of 18 who had been part of the eight-week trip.

On the morning of June 7 he had left their camp, heading towards Altai and shortly afterwards had been passed by the father-of-three who he described as a competent rider.

'About 20 or 30 seconds later he hit a pothole. He lost the front, there was just dust and sand.'

He said he found Mr Grennan lying in the recovery position next to his bike, which was a write-off.

Coroner Elisabeth Bussey-Jones said 'It is clear that one of the significant factors was the remote location and the incredible difficulty of getting medical help.'

She also said bosses should consider what could have been done better and how best to protect tourists travelling with them.

She concluded that Mr Grennan died from a road traffic collision.

Andrew Grennan was on a motorcycle holiday in Mongolia heading for Altai when he had a fatal accident

After the hearing Mr Grennan's widow Claire, 40, criticised expedition bosses for showing 'no sense of urgency' to get her husband potentially lifesaving treatment.

Mrs Grennan – who is bringing up the couple's three children alone in Aldridge, Walsall, West Mids – said: 'Andrew absolutely loved his motorbike and he was really looking forward to this trip to Mongolia.

'He was very much a family man, very hard working and never complained about anything.

'Our family has been left heartbroken by losing Andrew in such tragic circumstances.

'As the extent of his injuries were horrific, we are desperate to find out why there was no sense of urgency to get him to hospital for potentially lifesaving treatment.

'We would like to thank the Coroner for looking into the accident for us and hope that with the help of our team at Irwin Mitchell we will be able to find answers to all of our questions.'

Mr Grennan's sister Joanne Burford said 'Although the inquest answered some questions it has brought up other questions which were not answered.

'Why did they stop at a village where they knew there were not going to be any medical facilities?

'There were no satellite phones available.'

Lesley Edwards, a specialist international personal injury lawyer at Irwin Mitchell, who represented the family, added: 'This has been an incredibly difficult time for the family who have understandably been devastated by their loss.
