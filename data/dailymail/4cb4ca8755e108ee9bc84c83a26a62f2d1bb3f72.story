Boris Johnson is to renounce his US citizenship, clearing the way for him to become Prime Minister.

The London mayor has dual nationality because he was born in New York - but has now revealed he wants to hand back his American passport.

He said: 'The reason I'm thinking I probably will want to make a change is that my commitment is, and always has been, to Britain.'

He added: 'It's an accident of birth that has left me with this thing. I've got to find a way of sorting it out.'

Mr Johnson - who is running for parliament in Uxbridge and South Ruislip - said he would approach US ambassador Matthew Barzun about the change.

'It is a laborious business. They don't make it easy for you,' he told the Sunday Times during a week-long tour in the States.

Constitutional experts believe dual nationality would not present any technical barrier to Mr Johnson becoming prime minister, but he would be likely to face questions about his loyalties.

Aides said the mayor's priority was to avoid paying more to the US tax authorities, after he was recently forced to settle a large capital gains tax bill.

Boris Johnson wants to be given a key role in David Cameron's planned EU renegotiation after the election in May, he has revealed.

The London Mayor wants to put his expertise on Brussels, where he was a journalist in the 1990s, to advise the prime minister on how to win concessions from the EU.

'He knows the scene very well. If he wasn't mayor he would put himself forward,' a source told the Sunday Times

Mr Johnson admitted he had 'strong views about how a renegotiation could happen'.

He added: 'I'd be very happy to help. I think there's a deal to be done. If I wasn't happily lashed to my oar as mayor of London, I would do it [full time].' 

Mr Johnson yesterday met the left-wing New York City Bill de Blasio, on the last day of his US visit.

Although Mr Johnson was on a trade mission across the East Coast, much of the six-day visit had been dominated by talks on how to tackle the increased terror threat in major cities.

Mr Johnson also took the opportunity to pay tribute to those killed in the September 11 attacks, insisting Britain and America will 'never to give in to those who mean us harm'.

The mayor was given a tour of the memorial created to mark the 2001 tragedy by co-founder of the Tribute Centre Lee Ielpi, whose firefighter son Jonathan died trying to save others.

He left flowers with a message that read: 'The people of London will never forget the thousands who lost their lives on 9/11 2001.

'We honour the memory. We remember the sufferings of their families and all the bereaved. Our two cities embody the highest values of our civilisation: freedom, democracy, pluralism amd tolerance.

'We are jointly resolved never to compromise those values and never to give in to those who mean us harm.'
