A man died after suffering massive burns from a fire that ripped through his terraced home when he lit the sitting room fire.

Jeffrey Chadwick, 27, did not realise that the gas canister in his back yard was leaking, causing fumes to drift throughout his house whenever the kitchen door or window was opened.

Soon after he turned on his gas fire in September last year, vapours wafting through his house caused a huge 'flash' blast which ripped through his property.

Jeffery Chadwick, 29, died 11 days after fire ripped through his terraced home in Nelson, Lancashire

Today an inquest into Mr Chadwick's death heard how he told firefighters who came to the scene that the gas canister 'was supposed to be empty'.Â  He died in hospital 11 days later.

Mr Chadwick, who shared the terraced house in Nelson, Lancashire, with his father, had kept the cylinder behind the house for up to three years.

He was not aware that the Calor Gas container, of the type used for barbecues, still had gas in it and that its valve was partially open, allowing deadly butane gas to seep through the house.

The fumes - which are heavier than air -
remained at ground level and wafted across the yard and through the terraced property when a door or window was opened.

The inquest in Burnley heard how on the evening of September 7, Mr Chadwick switched on the fire in his sitting room.

At 7.40pm, a spark from the fire 
suddenly ignited flames which tore across the living room carpet, 
through the kitchen and out into the yard, where some rubbish caught 
fire.

Mr Chadwick was at home in Nelson by himself when the accident happened last autumn, and neighbours called 999

Mr Chadwick, who was thought to be outside in the yard when the explosion happened, suffered 46 per cent burns to his torso, upper body, and face.

Firefighters were summoned by neighbours who reported hearing an explosion, and they found Mr Chadwick hobbling out of the house.

Watch manager David Robinson said: 'He had no clothes on the top half of his body, his hair was singed and there were burns to both his arms.

'I think he was in shock but was talking relatively coherently.

'He said: "It was supposed to be empty" and "There wasn't supposed to be anything in it".'

Mr Chadwick was initially taken to 
Royal Blackburn Hospital before being transferred to a specialist burns 
unit at Pinderfields Hospital, Wakefield.

He died on September 18 from 
respiratory distress syndrome, a lung infection caused by reaction to 
traumatic injuries such as burns.

Fire incident intelligence officer 
Steve Green, who investigated the accident, said the valve on the 
canister had been loosened, allowing the gas to be sucked into Mr Chadwick's home.

He said: 'Butane gas would have been
released. This type of gas is twice as heavy as air and acts very much 
like water, staying close to the ground and finding any available space.

'It
flows like water until it finds an ignition source. The flames flashed 
back from the lounge, into the kitchen and into the yard.

'It wouldn't have taken a lot of gas 
to spread quickly through the house. The canister itself did not 
explode, it was the released gas.

'For it to ignite it would have 
needed to be in concentrations of between two and 10 per cent and would 
need to come into contact with a naked flame, in this case the gas fire in the lounge.

'There will have been a sudden flash explosion which swept through the house and yard.'

Mr Green said that Mr Chadwick's bath was running upstairs when firefighters arrived, which indicated that he was looking to cool his burns down after the explosion.

Recording a verdict of accidental 
death, East Lancashire coroner Richard Taylor said: 'It doesn't explain 
why the valve was open. It was a very very tragic accident in the most 
unusual circumstances.'

After the hearing a neighbour said: 
'There was a massive bang that evening and the fire engines were there 
within a couple of minutes.

'I saw Jeffrey on the street, he was shirtless and being attended to. It was a shock when we heard he had died.'

After the inquest, fire chiefs said that people who handled butane and propane gas should treat
it with care.
