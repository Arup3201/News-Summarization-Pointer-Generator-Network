David Lowe, who was sacked after he played an old version of The Sun Has Got Its Hat On, claims the show was pre-recorded - but no one at the BBC approved it for transmission before it was played

A BBC DJ who was sacked after playing a song containing the N-word has said his show was pre-recorded - but no one at the corporation approved it for broadcast.

David Lowe, 68, lost his job after playing a 1932 version of The Sun Has Got His Hat On during his Sunday night show on BBC Radio Devon.

The version contains the line: ‘He’s been tanning n****** out in Timbuktu, now he’s coming back to do the same to you.’

Following the broadcast, Mr Lowe immediately offered to apologise on air for his error - but the corporation ordered Mr Lowe to 'fall on his sword' after just one listener complained.

Today, Mr Lowe has said the show was pre-recorded - but it not approved for transmission by station managers as required by the BBC's compliance system.

Furthermore, Mr Lowe claimed the offending song was still on the 
BBC's system almost two weeks after his show was aired.

The DJ said the incident highlighted how the process - which was tightened following the so-called Sachsgate scandal in 2008 - needed 'scrapping or completely rethinking.'

The 'Sachsgate' saga was when presenter Jonathan Ross and comedian Russell Brand left a series of lewd messages on the answerphone of Faulty Towers actor Andrew Sachs.

The show was pre-recorded and therefore should have been checked by station managers at BBC Radio 2.

Brand and Lesley Douglas, controller of the station, resigned from the BBC following the scandal - and the corporation was fined by Ofcom.

Today, a BBC spokesman confirmed Mr Lowe's show was recorded in advance, but it was categorised as a 'low risk'.

Mr Lowe told The Telegraph he would record his shows six days before they were due to be broadcast.

He described how he would upload the audio along with the compliance forms to the station's internal system well in advance.

Mr Lowe says the system requires a broadcaster to nominate someone in BBC management to listen to the show.

BBC spokesman confirmed Mr Lowe's show was recorded in advance today, but it was categorised as  'low risk'.

However, Mr Lowe says when he went to check if his show had been approved two days prior to broadcast, it had not been listened to.

He told the newspaper: 'I immediately emailed the managing editor and said "I see it has not been approved, we are getting a bit close for comfort."

'He immediately came back to me and said "Ok, I will deal with that". I said "Thanks a lot" and forgot about it.

The
 lyrics to The Sun Has Got His Hat On have been changed several times 
since Noel Gay (above) and Ralph Butler wrote the original in 1932.

It
 was composed for the musical Me And My Girl and first recorded by the 
Henry Hall BBC Dance Orchestra, with vocals by Val Rosing.

The second verse went: ‘He’s been tanning n*****s out in Timbuktu, Now he’s coming back to do the same for you.’

Jonathan King, who was jailed in 2001 for sexually abusing teenagers in the 1980s, covered the song in 1971.

He changed the lyric to: ‘He’s been tanning negroes in Timbuktu.’

More
 recent versions have changed it to: ‘He’s been roastin’ peanuts out in 
Timbuktu’ or just ‘shining brightly out  in Timbuktu’.

'When I went back into the compliance form again on the Monday evening after transmission, I noticed the programme was still pending – in other words, it had not been approved for transmission.'

A BBC spokeswoman said today: 'His weekly show was categorised as low risk and therefore did not require complex sign off procedures.

'The key point remains that we should not have accepted his resignation.'

After the show was broadcast on April 27, friends and colleagues rallied to support Mr Lowe.

Others accused the BBC of double standards for allowing Top Gear host Jeremy Clarkson to keep his job after mumbling the N-word in an outtake of his motoring show.

Mr Lowe offered to apologise on air for the mistake - but BBC executives asked him not to mention the slip-up.

They then asked if they could announce he wanted to leave to ‘pursue other interests’.

Emma Clements, BBC Devon’s acting editor, eventually wrote to him saying: ‘I agree you have acted properly throughout and we are grateful for both your apology and your appreciation of the seriousness of the situation.

'But regrettably, I think we will have to accept your offer to fall on your sword to resolve this situation.’

Mr Lowe's former boss at BBC Radio 
Devon Roy Corlett, said at the time: ‘To end David’s career in this way 
when Clarkson was given a rap on the knuckles is absolutely appalling. 
It is an outrageous way to treat a loyal and distinguished employee. You
 couldn’t wish to meet a nicer man.’

Another
 former Radio Devon station manager, John Lilley, added: ‘It is a tragic
 end to a 32-year career with the BBC. I think what they did to David 
was disgraceful. He is a lovely man and has long been known to his 
colleagues as the Gentle Giant.’

Prime Minister David Cameron said his 
dismissal was 'slightly unfair' while Boris Johnson said the corporation
 acted in a 'disgraceful' way by firing the veteran DJ.

Mr Johnson said in his Telegraph column today: ‘There is certainly no logic at the BBC. They should restore Mr Lowe to his job - if he will take it - and the entire BBC board should go down to Devon to apologise in person, and at their own expense.’
