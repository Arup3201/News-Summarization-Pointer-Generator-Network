MPs are on course to earn more than £60,000 from the BBC this year, figures have revealed.

In the first four months of the year the corporation paid Members of Parliament £20,000 to appear on its TV shows.

The figures are buried in the latest register of members interests, which lists MPs' earnings on top of their £67,060 salary.

MPs sparked a furious public outcry when their expense claims were exposed. But they are still free to top up their £67,000 a year salary - as long as they declare it openly

The revelation, revealed by Press Gazette, is likely to infuriate voters and licence fee payers who earn a fraction of an MP's salary without option of extra work.

Some £8,000 of the BBC's £20,000 bill went to Tory MP Rory Stewart for his documentary 'Border', about the area between England and Scotland.

Labour's Alan Johnson was paid £5,317, between December 16 last year and March 27.

Fellow Labour MP Dianne Abbott, a regular on Andrew Neil's This Week alongside former Tory minister Michael Portillo, has raked in £2,800.

Labour's Sadiq Khan and Tory Tim Loughton have both been paid £1,500 for appearances on Have I Got News For You.

Mr Khan donated his money to charity.

But no MP can match moonlighting London Mayor Boris Johnson when it comes to outside earnings from the media.

Mr Johnson pockets £250,000 a year for his weekly column in The Daily Telegraph.

BBC Director General Tony Hall promised to crack down on excesses at the Corporation. Many voters will question whether it is fair that they pay for an MP's salary - and for them to appear on TV

The Mayor has previously defended his mega pay packet - even claiming it was 'chicken feed'.

He said: 'I don't see why, on a Sunday morning I shouldn't knock off an article.

'If
 someone wants to pay me for that article, then that's their lookout – 
and of course I make a substantial donation to charity.

'Maybe
 that money shouldn't go to charity; maybe you'd rather I didn't make 
those contributions to charity. It seems to me to be a wholly reasonable
 thing to do.'

According to the register of MPs’ interests newspapers have so far this year paid MPs some £17,905.40

The Telegraph has so far this year paid MPs £6,990, according to the register. This includes a monthly payment of £400 to Tory backbencher Douglas Careswell to write three blog posts a week.

Former Northern Ireland Secretary Peter Hain meanwhile, was paid £1,650 for just one Sunday Telegraph article.

The Mail newspapers have so far paid MPs £6,100 for their work this year. Former Tory leadership candidate David Davis has been paid £3,800 for three articles, while I'm A Celebrity contestant Nadine Dorries has been paid £1,900.

The Times and Sunday Times meanwhile paid £2,000 to MPs on the register. The Financial Times meanwhile has paid Tory John Barron £2,000 so far this year. And The Independent has paid £1,250 to Labour's Chris Bryant as well as £165.40 to former Foreign Secretary Jack Straw.

Elsewhere, the controversial Respect MP George Galloway has been paid £6,400 for work on Russia Today - the broadcaster recently praised by Vladimir Putin for its 'objective' reporting on Crimea.
