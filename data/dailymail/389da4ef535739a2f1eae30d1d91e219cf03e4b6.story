For many long-haul travellers, it is the nightmare scenario.

You are just settling down for a nap or to read when a young child in the row behind starts screaming or kicking the seat, and doesn’t stop.

Now a budget airline has come up with a solution for passengers who find their journey spoilt by crying babies and toddlers’ tantrums – by introducing child-free zones.

Adults only: The airline has promised soft light and no disruptions in their Quiet Zone, that only allows 12-year-olds and over to sit there (file picture)

But selecting a seat in the ‘quiet zone’, which will also have softer lighting, costs up to £22 extra.

The idea, which is likely to anger 
parents as well as appeal to child-free travellers, is being marketed by
 AirAsia’s no-frills long-haul carrier AirAsia X.

The first seven rows in the economy 
cabin are off-limits to children under 12 on flights from Kuala Lumpur 
in Malaysia to Australia, China, Japan and some other destinations.

The airline, which uses the slogan 
‘Now everyone can fly’, said the section on its fleet of Airbus A330s, 
which is separated from the rest of economy by a set of toilets and a 
curtain, now offers a ‘more relaxing cabin atmosphere’. Passengers 
booking in this section must pay between £8 and £22 extra.

The airline is owned by Malaysian 
entrepreneur Tony Fernandes, the owner and chairman of Premiership 
football club Queens Park Rangers, who since buying AirAsia in 2001 has 
transformed it from a loss-making business into Asia’s largest budget 
airline.

Air Asia launched the seats last week on flights from Kuala Lumper to Australia, China and Japan

Chief executive Azran Osman-Rani said the idea ‘allows our 
guests to have a more pleasant and peaceful journey with minimal noise 
and less disturbance.’

He added: ‘The airline is not banning 
kids from travelling, but instead, is enhancing the array of product 
offerings on board to suit its guests’ individual needs and 
preferences.’

There are no immediate signs of UK airlines bringing in a similar system, however.

Easyjet said: ‘We don’t have any plans
 for anything like this.

'We have just changed over to a system of 
fully-allocated seating so customers can choose where they want to sit 
and don’t plan any more changes.’

British Airways said: ‘We welcome families in all our cabins and have no plans to offer child-free zones.’

Virgin Atlantic also said it had ‘no plans’ to follow Air Asia’s lead.

A poll by the Tripadvisor website last
 year found that over a third of Britons would be prepared to pay extra 
for their flights if they did not have to sit near children.

Another 
survey found 53 per cent supported child-free flights.

Last year Malaysia Airlines created a child-free zone on the upper deck of the new Airbus A380 on some of its long-haul flights.
