They were meant to be simple warnings to young people enjoying a summer night out, at a time when alcohol-fuelled sex attacks are at their peak.

But West Mercia Police were forced to apologise yesterday after campaigners said the posters for its Safe Night Out initiative suggested rape victims were to blame if they were drunk.

One poster pictured a smiling woman above another photo of her lying barefoot and apparently unconscious with her dress riding up her thighs.

Controversial: The posters, part of a police campaign, have caused outrage for suggesting that rape victims are to blame if they drink too much

The warning reads: ‘Don’t let a night 
full of promise turn into a morning full of regrets.’ Beneath the 
woman’s prostrate figure, the poster states: ‘Don’t leave yourself more 
vulnerable to regretful sex or even rape. Drink sensibly and get home 
safely.’

A second poster aimed at men also 
sparked fury, for saying they ‘could’ be breaking the law and arrested 
if someone hasn’t given their consent for sex or touching.

A senior officer at the Midlands 
force, which covers  Herefordshire, Worcestershire and Shropshire, 
apologised after anti-rape campaigners expressed outrage at the campaign
 messages.

Around town: Hundreds of the posters were put up in towns like Herefordshire, as well as Shropshire and Worcestershire last month

Jocelyn Anderson, of Worcestershire 
Rape and Sexual Assault Support Centre, said: ‘There is no “could be” 
about it – that’s rape – and to put regretful sex and rape together is 
appalling.

‘The problem was the poster put the 
blame on to alcohol and women who are raped, suggesting if they didn’t 
drink they could avoid rape.

Police campaign: The Safe Night Out campaign aimed to encourage young people not to make themselves vulnerable by getting drunk

‘It’s not alcohol that causes rape, although it’s a vulner- ability factor. It’s rapists that cause rape.’

Hundreds of the posters were put up in
 pubs throughout the force area last month to coincide with a 
three-weekend spell over July when statistics show drink-fuelled sex 
assaults reach an annual peak.

Detective Superintendent Ivan Powell admitted there had been ‘some concerns’ about the poster aimed at women.

He said: ‘If the campaign has caused distress, that was not our aim and I will apologise for that.

‘This was not about blaming victims but putting information out to help.’ The posters have now been taken down.'

Hundreds of the offending posters were put up in pubs in Herefordshire, Shropshire and Worcestershire last month.

While the police's website links to a webpage dedicated to the campaign and video, the link has been removed.

The campaign video features a female rape victim was also released as part of the campaign with the aim of encouraging women to drink less while on a night out.
