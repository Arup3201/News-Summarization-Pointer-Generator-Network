Television chef Hugh  Fearnley-Whittingstall has added fresh squirrel to the menu of one of his restaurants.

Grey squirrel braised in a tomato and red wine sauce is being served up to customers at River Cottage Canteen in Plymouth, Devon.

The unusual dish comes as the food world is still reeling from the horsemeat scandal but its inclusion on the menu conforms to  Fearnley-Whittingstall's belief in promoting wild food from sustainable sources.

The squirrels were shot at River Cottage headquarters at Park Farm on the Devon-Dorset border and were prepared by sous-chef Andy Richardson.

He says the meat has a gamey flavour, similar to rabbit.

Grey squirrel is plentiful and widely regarded as a pest by both farmers and growers and conservationists but it has yet to catch on as a delicacy among foodies.

'It will be interesting to see how the guests react to it, because it is nice for us to offer something different,' said front of house manager Marie Mitchell.

Seven squirrels were shot at River Cottage and it took chef Andy Richardson an hour and a half to butcher them

It took Mr Richardson an hour and a half to butcher the seven squirrels, yielding a modest amount of meat.

He said: 'You'd need one and a half squirrels for a main course. That's why we are serving it as starters.'

The sous chef adapted a recipe for braised rabbit from Hugh's Meat book, using squirrel in its place.

The squirrel joints are marinated with
red wine and juniper berries for 24 hours, both to tenderise the meat 
and to give it flavour.

They
are then cooked very slowly with root vegetables and onions in red wine
and tinned Italian tomatoes until the meat is tender.

Appetising: The grey squirrel does not give much meat and one and a half animals are needed for a main course

Although they are only being used as a starter now, Mr Richardson says they could feature on the menu again in the autumn when the squirrels are more plump.

He said: 'That is when they are at their heaviest, after they have been eating nuts and fruit all summer.

'You're meant to eat squirrel in the late summer or autumn, because that's when they are at their heaviest.'

He said the inclusion of squirrel also silences critics who say the menu at River Cottage is 'too safe'.
