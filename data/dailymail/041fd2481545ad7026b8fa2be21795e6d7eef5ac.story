Chilling images showing the mundane preparations ahead of a hate-filled Nazi rally have been captured by a photographer given unprecedented access.

Photographer Johnny Milano was allowed to shoot behind the scenes at the National Socialist Movement convention in Atlanta, Georgia, after months of negotiations with Nazi leaders.

The disturbing photographs show white supremacists ironing their swastikas and getting tattoos as they kill time in their hotel rooms.

About 40 neo-Nazis and Klu Klux Klan 
members attended the meeting at the Wellesley Hotel in Atlanta to 
commemorate the birthday of Adolf Hitler on April 20.

Mr Milano's collection of photographs gives an insight into the dark world of white supremacists.

The images reveal the strict rules and regulations that Nazi party members have to follow. They are seen ironing their swastika armbands to make sure they are in pristine condition ahead of a formal Nazi sit-down meal.

Despite Mr Milano's presence, Nazis proudly show off the fascist tattoos that commemorate Hitler.

Many
 members have the number '88' tattooed on them, which represents the 
words Heil Hitler.

Others sport the number 14, which represents the words: 'We must secure the existence of our people and a future for white children.'

The disturbing pictures show how neo-Nazis even turned a hotel room into a makeshift parlour and gave each other extra tattoos.

Mr Milano spent four months trying to get access to the Nazi conference.

The photojournalist said he had 
always been interested in the 'political right' and reached out to a 
number or far-right groups for the project.

After a brief interview, Mr Milano, who is a freelance photographer based in New York, was finally granted access to the convention.

He said in a blog on Petapixel.com that his pictures only 'scratch the surface' of what he wanted to achieve.

He wrote: 'The images that I walked away with aren’t home runs, but they’re definitely a step up above the generic rally and swastika pictures that are rampant among projects like this.'

The collection also captures the anger among anti-fascists who lined up to demonstrate against the convention.

Windows of Nazi party member's cars were smashed and their tyres were punctured.

About 100 anti-fascists gathered to protest against them, and one woman was seen goose-stepping along their march dressed in a red nose and holding a sign that read 'Racism is ridiculous.'

The National Socialist Party claims to be America's biggest active 'white civil rights group', although some experts estimate it has only about 400 members in 32 states.

The group lists its core beliefs on its website to be 'defending the rights of white people', preserving so-called European culture, strengthening family values, reform of immigration policies and the 'promotion of white separation'.
