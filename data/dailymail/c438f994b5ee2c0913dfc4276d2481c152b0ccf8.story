Resplendent in a fuchsia cashmere coat by Stewart Parvin and a jaunty matching hat by Angela Kelly, the Queen was wreathed in smiles as she arrived for the traditional Maundy Thursday service at Blackburn Cathedral.

Joined by a dapper Duke of Edinburgh, the monarch beamed as she was greeted by cheering crowds of well wishers and handed a posy of Spring blooms as she made her way into the 188-year-old building.

During the service, the Queen distributed bags of coins to a group of pensioners, continuing a royal tradition that is more than 800 years old.

The original version of the Maundy Service involved the sovereign giving money to the 
poor and washing their feet, a tradition which ended with James II in 
the 18th century.

The custom of washing feet is an an 
ancient one and commemorates the last supper of Jesus with the Apostles,
 echoing the story of Christ washing the extremities of his disciples shortly 
before his death.

Although foot washing is no longer part of the ceremony, the tradition of giving 'alms' continues, albeit symbolically.

The Maundy gift, which the Queen handed to 88 men and 88 women - one for each of the Queen's 88 years - is made up of two purses, one red and one white.

In a ceremony full of pomp, Yeomen in 
red tunics carried the purses on golden platters, following the Queen as
 she distributed the money to the accompaniment of organ music and 
choristers singing God Save The Queen from Handel's Zadok The Priest.

Recipient Alec Stuttard, 74, from Ewood in Blackburn, was especially pleased to receive the Maundy gift.

As
 a 13-year-old he was chosen to represent Blackburn 
Cathedral in the choir singing at the Queen's Coronation in 1953 - but was forced to pull out because of laryngitis.

Speaking about his meeting with the Queen, a delighted Mr Stuttard said: 'It was brilliant. The funny thing is as she came to give me the money 
the choir started to sing Zadok The Priest, which is what I would have 
sung at the Coronation. I was shaking.

Another recipient, James
 Nelson, 79, a former engineer, was chosen for his efforts in maintaining St Andrew's Church in Leyland, Lancashire.

'It was wonderful, just wonderful,' revealed Mr Nelson. 'A great honour and a very moving service, it's just a privilege to be here.'

Stanley Smith, 73, a retired salesman from Leyland who also received a purse from the Queen added: 'Today was just absolutely wonderful.

'The Queen looks 
absolutely immaculate and I feel so humble I was one of only 88 men 
chosen, it's something else, I am so honoured.'

This year the Red Purse contains a £5 coin, commemorating the 300th anniversary of Queen Anne's reign and a 50p coin commemorating the 20th Commonwealth Games in Glasgow this summer. 

Historically, the Red Purse contained an allowance of £3 for clothing, £1.50 in lieu of provisions and £1 for the redemption of the Sovereign's gown. 

The White Purse contains uniquely minted Maundy money. This takes the form of one, two, three and four silver penny pieces, the sum of which equals the number of years of the monarch's age.

Busy: The Maundy tradition is more than 800 years old and used to include the monarch washing peoples' feet

All smiles: The Queen beamed as she handed the assembled pensioners the red and white Maundy purses

Custom: The Maundy purses contain money and special Maundy coins which feature the Queen circa 1952

Since her accession in 1952, the image of the Queen on ordinary circulating coinage has undergone three changes, but Maundy coins still bear the same portrait of Her Majesty prepared by Mary Gillick for the first coins issued in the year of her coronation in 1953.

The service ended with a trumpet fanfare and the national anthem before the procession left the cathedral, with the Right Reverend Julian Henderson, the Bishop of Blackburn, leading the royal party to the cathedral's Great West Door.

Following the service, in keeping with Royal Maundy tradition, the Queen and the Duke of Edinburgh met local rdignitaries during a reception at Blackburn Rovers Football Club.
