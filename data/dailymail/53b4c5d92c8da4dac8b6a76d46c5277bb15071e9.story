Alexis Marie Garcia, of Birmingham, Alabama, was the victim of a brutal beating at the hands of her best friend and her friend's 39-year-old boyfriend, police said.

Wright said she, Garcia and Yager had driven to Tucker Mountain Road in Remlap on the night of the incident, March 8, and she passed out.

She said woke up to see Garcia taking off her clothes and making advances on Yager, according to AL.com. 

Blount County Sheriff's Department received a phone call from Wright's father on March 9, in which he said that his daughter called him after she woke up in a room covered in blood. 

She said she had blacked out and didn't know where she was, but told her father that she had been walking in the woods with Yager and Garcia, court records show.

A few days later Garcia's mother called investigators to tell them that there were some teenagers in the area who might know information.
