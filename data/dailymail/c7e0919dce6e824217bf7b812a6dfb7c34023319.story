Parents claim their children have been left with nowhere to play after a local authority decided to rip out playgrounds to cut costs.

Carlisle City Council will spend more than £10,000 bulldozing swings, slides and other play equipment at 21 sites.

It says it will save £400,000 in maintenance costs but the move sparked anger among parents and children, who have been left with muddy wastelands.

Parents, including Tracy Dixon (pictured with her son, Josh, four), claim their children have been left with nowhere to play after a local authority decided to rip out playgrounds to cut costs

The first most families knew about it was when bulldozers began tearing out equipment.

Tracy Dixon says her four-year-old son Josh no longer had a place to play after their local playground was chosen as one of the sites to  be demolished.

‘I live right next to the park and I was able to keep an eye on Josh when he was playing,’ she said.

‘The first I knew about them knocking it down was when the bulldozers arrived at 8am one morning.

‘The nearest playground is a 15-minute walk away and apart from the fact that I have a three-month-old baby to consider, a lot of teenagers hang around there and it can be intimidating for the little ones.’

Elsie Baty runs a residents’ action group in the Botcherby area of  Carlisle, where two playgrounds have already been removed.

‘The council should be encouraging children to get out and play, not pulling the playgrounds down,’ she said. ‘Where are the kids supposed to go now? To get to the nearest playground they need a lift in a car. They’ll just end up hanging round on street corners.’

Opponents of the proposal claim that they were not consulted. Rob Betton, an independent councillor for Botcherby on Cumbria County Council, said locals were shocked by the unexpected nature of the council’s move.

‘They have just sent in the bulldozers and the diggers without so much as a by-your-leave to the residents,’ he said. ‘Parents have woken up to find their children’s playgrounds gone and massive holes in the ground where they used to be.

‘It’s all very well for the council to say they’re having to make cuts, but why should the children have to suffer? What they’re doing is an absolute disgrace.’

There are 69 council-maintained playgrounds in Carlisle. The council says the 21 to be dismantled had poor equipment and were underused. The savings would go towards maintaining the remaining 48 areas.

But locals claim there was nothing wrong with the equipment that has been removed. ‘The money that it must be costing the council to pull it out doesn’t justify what they are doing,’ said resident George Little.

A city council spokesman said: ‘We will re-landscape the sites, replacing fixed equipment with soft landscaping. The intention is to create play facilities in a safe environment and accessible to every child.’
