The outgoing U.S. commander in Afghanistan, General David Petraeus, marked his last Fourth of July in uniform by speaking to American troops during a re-enlistment ceremony in the south of the country.

The 58-year-old, who was recently confirmed as the next director of the CIA, told the 235 troops re-enlisting in Kandahar province that they have achieved progress on the battlefield but that 'much work remains' to be done in Afghanistan.

'You raised your right hand and said: "Send me," and today you raised your right hand again and said: "Send me again, if needed,''' he told the soldiers on America's 235th birthday.

Gen. Petraeus addresses troops after saluting. The outgoing Army boss administered the oath of re-affirmation and re-enlistment to 235 U.S. troops

'I cannot say how impressive your action is - it is the most meaningful display of patriotism possible.'

Gen.
Petraeus will be replaced by U.S. Marine Lt. Gen. John Allen even as 
33,000 American troops begin to withdraw from Afghanistan, to mark the 
start of President Barack Obama's promised withdrawal of all combat 
troops by 2014.

Later today, Gen. Petraeus is to speak at another re-enlistment ceremony at Bagram Air Field, just north of Kabul.

Meanwhile, NATO said a service member was killed earlier today in a bomb attack in eastern Afghanistan.

The death brings the number of NATO fatalities in Afghanistan this year to 271, three of them this month.

Yesterday
three U.S. Senators visiting Afghanistan criticised the pace of 
withdrawal and expressed concerns that it may leave NATO with too few 
troops to deal a decisive blow to the insurgency.

'I believe that the planned draw-down is an unnecessary risk,' John McCain, a Republican from Arizona, said.

Mr McCain, who lost out in the presidential race to Mr Obama in 2008, arrived in Afghanistan with senators Joe Lieberman and Lindsay Graham.

Also yesterday, five Afghan police officers were killed in a four-hour gun battle between Afghan security forces and NATO troops, and insurgents in the Bala Buluk district of Farah province in western Afghanistan.
