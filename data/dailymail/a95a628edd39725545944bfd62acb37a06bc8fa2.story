A mother and daughter obsessed with celebrities have managed to snap more than 400 photos with some of Britain's best-loved faces.

Jade Foote, 33, and her daughter Sydney, 11, have a huge collection of images with A-listers – from Ant and Dec and David Walliams, to Amy Childs and Chloe Sims.

The mother-of-one, from Sheerness, said her obsession with celebrity spotting started when she won tickets to the Inside Soap awards.

Since then, she has been to the NTA's, the Brit Awards and the X Factor launch and her selfie album has grown rapidly.

And the pair have attended so many red carpet events, that some of the celebrities even recongise the pair.

Jade said: 'I'm a massive soap fan and watch all four British soaps religiously and I even run a soap based Twitter account live tweeting throughout the shows.'

Her tweets have amassed 18,000 followers and she has been named number one soap blogger by Daz.

Her prize was to interview celebrities on the red carpet at the TV Choice awards.

From stars in TOWIE to Geordie Shore, from Wetherfield to the Dales; Jade has met them all.

However, her favourite soap star is Mark Charnock who plays Marlon Dingle from Emmerdale.

She said: 'Mark is one of the nicest people I've ever met and he always comes and says hello if we see him at events.

'Tom Hardy was absolutely adorable and took loads of time to pose for pictures and chat with fans. Ant and Dec, Eammon Holmes and Alan Carr are also some of my favourites.' 

Her daughter Sydney, 11 has also been bitten by the celeb superfan bug. She has met more than 100 celebrities but is determined to catch up with her mum.

Sydney said: 'My favourite celebrity is David Walliams because he's so funny.

I also love Marvin Hulmes from JLS but I'm determined to meet him and get a picture without crying next time!'
