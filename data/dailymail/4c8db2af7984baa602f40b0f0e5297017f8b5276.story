Giannis Antetokounmpo is relishing to opportunity to play in front of a sold-out crowd in London on Thursday night on his return to Europe.

The 20-year-old known as ‘the Greek freak’ has become one of the star players in a young Milwaukee Bucks team since moving to the States from his native Greece two years ago.

Giannis practised with his team-mates at the O2 Arena on Wednesday ahead of their clash with the New York Knicks, and he is looking forward to putting on a show for the London crowd.

‘I feel great and very happy that I’m going to play in Europe and I think we’re going to have fun,’ Giannis said after practice.

‘I have been out and went to Tower Bridge and had a picture. London is really nice and the weather is nice because in Milwaukee the weather is really bad.

‘I’m going to have about 15 to 17 of my people here including my coach from my Greek team and my friends and we are going to have fun. I’m going to take them for dinner after the game and we will spend some time together.’

In the two years he has spent in Milwaukee since leaving Greece and entering the NBA draft, Giannis has become one of the most exciting young players in the league.

The Greek star is the second highest scorer for the Bucks this season behind only point guard Brandon Knight, and his form has been instrumental in helping his team get off to a strong start this season in their bid to make the play-offs.

‘I came into the league and didn’t know what to expect,’ he said. ‘But I know how competitive I am and I wanted to be as good as possible. I have been listening to my coaches and when you work hard it pays off.

‘My coach and my parents are telling me all the time that the sky is the limit. If I keep working hard nobody knows where I could reach. My goal is to be an All Star player and to play in a winning team.

‘Everyday coach Kidd gives me advice and has me talking to great players like Hakeem Olajuwon and Dikembe Mutumbo. It was fun to talk to Hakeem. He is from Nigeria and so are my parents. He told me to work hard and stay away from temptation, just stay away from drugs - I told him not to worry.’

For a youngster who has moved away from home to pursue his career, Giannis displays incredible confidence and is very relaxed.

Point guard Knight said that the 20-year-old is ‘a pleasure to be around’.

Knight added: ‘He is a very talented guy and young player and has grown a lot and has got better since he has been in the NBA.’

Knight has been one of the leading point guards in the league this season, and his performances led to calls for him to be included in the All Star game.

The 23-year-old is already one of the more senior players in the team and is averaging 18.2 points per game, but insists there is still more to come.

‘I know I’m going to continue to get better and improve my game and it is just a matter of trying to win games,’ Knight said. I’m happier with how our team is doing and want to continue to win games.’

Knight made his second trip to London in the space of two years having travelled to England with the Detroit Pistons in January 2013 for their game against the Knicks.

He said: ‘You kind of know what to expect and once your body goes through it once it is a bit more used to it the next time.

‘I knew that this time I wanted to experience London a bit more whereas first time I just wanted to rest and be prepared for the game. I’m a little bit older now and wanted to take advantage of our time here.

‘When you get to play in front of a different group of fans who don’t see you very often it is big time.

‘I went to Chelsea, went to Buckingham Palace and did some shopping, so there are a lot of different things we don’t get to experience in the States that we get to experience here.’

Two years ago at the O2 Arena, Knight came up against his current coach Jason Kidd, who then played for the Knicks.

Kidd has made his third trip to London in as many seasons, having also travelled over 12 months ago to coach the Brooklyn Nets to victory over the Atlanta Hawks.

Unlike Knight, though, Kidd has already done all the sightseeing he needs to in London.

‘I’m a regular here now so all the sightseeing I have done in the past two years,’ the Bucks coach said. ‘I’ve just relaxed and prepared for the game. I love the culture and the food here - even the weather is warmer than Milwaukee so we will take it.’

Kidd is only in his second season as an NBA head coach having been traded to the Bucks by the Nets in the summer, and wants to continue to grow with his young team.

He said: ‘I’m still learning how to be a coach. Last year in Brooklyn I had a veteran ball club but this year in Milwaukee I have one of the second youngest teams in the league.

‘We both learn off each other, but these young men have been playing extremely well in the first half of the season so I still have a lot to learn about being a coach in this league.’
