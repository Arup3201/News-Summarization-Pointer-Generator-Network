Michael Swales, 41, admitted theft when he appeared at Burnley Magistrates Court

A trusted friend stole more than £4,000 from under a pensioner’s mattress after he confided that he was saving the cash for his funeral.

Trevor Barker, 72, who had no children, treated Michael Swales, 41, like a son and told him about the money so it could be spent in the event of his death.

But the jobless lodger betrayed Mr Barker’s trust by sneaking into his bedroom and helping himself to £4,200 of the £6,000 cash.

Unbeknown to retired factory worker Mr Barker, Swales was addicted to drugs and blew the money on cocaine and heroin. 

Yesterday Mr Barker said he had been left ‘heartbroken’ after Swales, whom he had known for 25 years, admitted theft.

He will face jail when he is sentenced later this month.

‘I treated this man like my own son and he threw it back in my face,’ Mr Barker said.

‘It has broken my heart to think of what he has done. He has betrayed my trust in the most terrible way.

‘That money was there for my funeral, he only knew it was there because I told him about it. I was going to leave him the house. I wake up each morning and I want to be sick.

‘I didn’t know he had a problem with drugs, but if he had told me I probably would have given him some money to help him.’

Burnley Magistrates’ Court was told that 18 months ago, Swales asked Mr Barker – who suffers from arthritis – if he could temporarily move into his semi-detached home in Colne, Lancashire, as he was having trouble finding a flat.

Parveen Akhtar, prosecuting, said Mr Barker, who had known Swales since he was a 16-year-old apprentice at the textiles factory where he worked, agreed.

‘Mr Barker had let [it be] known to the Swales family that he had been saving up for his funeral and had managed to save about £6,000,’ Miss Akhtar said.

‘He told the defendant that if anything should happen to him, it was kept between two mattresses on his bed. Mr Barker needs two mattresses to assist him to get in bed.’

But last month, Mr Barker noticed £4,200 had gone missing. He called the police, but they found no signs of a burglary.

‘When Mr Barker was checking his money, he noticed £4,200 had gone missing,’ Miss Akhtar said. ‘He allowed Michael Swales to reside at his property and clearly he’s been taken advantage of.’ 

Nick Cassidy, for Swales, said the theft was ‘truly despicable’, adding that his client was sorry for his ‘grave error of judgment’.

‘He is the first to accept the discomfort the victim must feel and is truly remorseful and sorry for his actions,’ Mr Cassidy said.

‘He has, unfortunately, been battling with a drug addiction for some time.

‘On the day of this offence, he had relapsed. He was trying to fund a drug addiction whilst reliant on benefits.’

Swales was given bail on condition that he did not contact Mr Barker or go to his home.

Magistrates warned him the offence was in breach of a ‘high degree of trust’. 

Trevor Barker, 72, who has no children, had hidden the money between his mattresses and confided in Swales because he wanted to make sure it got spent on his funeral. He says the theft has 'broken my heart'

Mr Barker said: 'It has broken my heart to think of what he has done. I wake up each morning and I want to be sick. 

'I didn't know he had a problem with drugs but - if he had told me, I probably would have given him some money to help him. 

'He has betrayed my trust in the most terrible way and I just do not know what to do. I just can't believe it after all the help I have given him over the years.

'When he moved into his own place I gave him my three piece suite sofa, a cooker, electrical kettle and curtains. I gave him everything to set himself up and then I used to go over and take him food. I'm surprised he didn't take the shirt off my back.'

He added: 'I used to work with Michael and I thought you could not have wished to have met a nicer lad. I met him when he was just 16 and the factory foreman had said to me "will you work with that young man - he is very shy" and I said sure.'

'I had once been a butcher when I left school and it turned out his uncle was a butcher in the place across from where I worked and I knew him. 

'So I went to meet his mother and family and I have been a friend of the family ever since. It's heart-breaking to think he could betray me like this.'
