Legal clerk and environmental activist Erin Brockovich - who was famously portrayed by Julia Roberts in a movie about her life - threw a cell phone into a lake and then slapped her husband just before she was arrested for drunken boating, according to a police report.

Brockovich, 52, appeared 'highly intoxicated' as she argued with her husband,Â  Eric L. Ellis, aboard a boat docked at the Las Vegas Boat Harbor on Lake Mead in Nevada last Friday, the arresting officer, Kasen Haslem, wrote in the report obtained by MailOnline. The mother of three later registered a blood alcohol content of .190 - more than twice the legal limit of .08.

Haslem was fueling up his own boat when he spotted the couple around 7:30 p.m.

'I watched as she threw a cell phone form the boat into the water,' he wrote. 'She then walked by her husband and she appeared to slap him.'

When the officer approached the 
couple, Brockovich 'started the boat and began backing out of the slip,'
Haslem stated. He ordered her to return the boat to the dock, at which 
point Brockovich stated 'that she was not very good at driving her 
boat.'

The officer then helped guide her vessel toward the slip and he began asking her questions about their argument.

'Her answers were very slurred,' Haslem stated. 'She also kept straying from the conversation and repeating herself.'

'I could also smell an alcoholic beverage on her breath,' he added.

Haslem performed field sobriety tests
and she failed nearly every one of them, he said. She was later booked 
into jail and released on a $1,000 bail.

Brockovich has since apologized for 
her arrest, though she denies the officer's claims that she backed her 
boat away from the marina.

'At no time was the boat away from 
the dock and there was no public safety risk,' she said in a statement, 
denying police claims that she operated the boat in open waters.

'That being said, I take drunk driving very seriously, this was clearly
a big mistake. I know better and I am very sorry,' she added. 'After a day in the sun and with 
nothing to eat it appears that a couple of drinks had a greater impact 
than I realized.'

Under Nevada law, a first-time offense of boating while intoxicated is a
misdemeanor that draws fines from $1,000 to $2,000 but no jail time. 
Authorities were unsure whether it was Brockovich's first arrest on the 
charge.

Brockovich, who married her third 
husband, Eric L. Ellis, in 1999, became a worldwide celebrity after the 
2000 Steven Soderbergh film about her life.

As a legal assistant she helped win a 
record $333 million settlement from a power company after dozens of 
people were poisoned by chemicals released into the water supply in the 
California town of Hinkley.

After suffering an injury in an auto 
accident, Brokovich hired the California law firm Masry and Vititoe to 
represent her in a civil lawsuit against the other driver. While the 
firm won her a small settlement, the single mother needed a job to 
support her family.

The law firm hired Brokovich as a 
file clerk, which is what ultimately launched the former Miss Pacific 
Coast's career in law and public advocacy.

While organizing files for a pro-bono
real estate case, Brokovich uncovered medical records that would lead 
to the largest settlement ever paid out in a direct action lawsuit in 
U.S. history.

Brokovich's investigation found that 
the Pacific Gas and Electric company had been poisoning Hinkley 
residents for more than 30 years.

Between 1952 and 1966, the company 
used the chemical hexavalent chromium (often referred to as Cr-6) to 
fight corrosion in the cooling tower in the Hinkley compressor, which 
was part of a natural gas pipeline connecting much of northern 
California to the San Francisco Bay area.

The waste water dissolved the Cr-6 and it ended up in unlined ponds near the cooling tower.

The Cr-6 then found its way into the groundwater, contaminating a two-by-one-mile area around the plant.

Because of Brokovich's research, more than 600 Hinklley residents shared the giant $333 million settlement.

For her work, Brokovich was given a $2 million bonus.

Julia Roberts won a Best Actress Oscar for her portrayal of Brockovich in the self-titled movie about the case.

Brokovich and Masry then became the 
face of environmental litigation and went on to file several lawsuits 
against various corporations for pollution issues.

Since the film, Brockovich has become a high profile campaigner and TV star with her own series, 'Final Justice.'

Just last year, Brockovich was back 
on the big screen in the documentary 'Last Call at the Oasis,' which 
explores challenges related to the planet's dwindling and increasingly 
polluted water supply.
