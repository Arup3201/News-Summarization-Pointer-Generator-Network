The bereaved parents of a Minnesota teen with a severe dairy allergy who died from eating pancakes are suing the small town diner where he was served them.

Cindy Johnson, mother of 16-year-old Scott Johnson, says she asked staff at the Minnesota Nice Cafe in Bemidji if their gluten-free pancakes were also dairy-free during a rare dining-out last June for the teen, who'd suffered from the deadly allergy since birth.

Johnson was assured the pancakes were safe and watched as her son ate two of them, reads the complaint. Three days later, Scott would be dead.

Assured they were okay: The bereaved parents of a teen with a severe dairy allergy who died last year after eating dairy-laced pancakes are suing the diner that served them to him

Severely allergic: 16-year-old Scott Johnson of Bemidji had been to the hospital due to dairy exposure before. His family had learned to be very careful about what and where he ate

'He had just finished and he said ''we have to go now,"' Cindy Johnson recalled of the moments after Scott, her second of four children, ingested the fatal breakfast.

Scott had suffered allergic reactions before, even from the slightest exposure to dairy. Previous trips to the emergency room had taught his family to be extremely cautious.

'If it wasn’t right, we didn’t eat until his was right,' Scott's father Steve Johnson told WCCO.

However, the Johnsons say they were assured by staff at Minnesota Nice that everything would be fine. And it just so happened that Scott had forgotten to bring along his life-saving EpiPen and nebulizer that June day.

Cindy rushed her son home. But when they got there, the epinephrine and nebulizer failed to calm Scott's short-circuiting immune system. 

'I was eighteen miles off the highway when I got the call,' said Steve Johnson, who was two hours away on a construction job when he learned his son was in dire straits. 'Hardest thing for me was I didn’t even get to talk to him.' 

Special breakfast: The family didn't normally go out to eat, but Scott's sisters wanted to treat him and their mother one morning last June

Communication failure? According to the complaint, the Minnesota Nice Cafe staff assured Cindy that her son's pancakes contained no dairy. Cindy also maintains she told them the grill would have to be cleaned before Scott's pancakes were cooked on it

Doctors told the Johnsons the dairy exposure had led to anaphylaxis so severe that Scott's heart had stopped. Three days after the family breakfast, Scott died.

Now the grieving mother and father are facing massive medical bills and want the Minnesota Nice Diner to take responsibility.

'Just one mistake can take someone’s life,' Cindy Johnson said. 

The Minnesota Nice Cafe owners are not commenting publicly on the pending case.

As the case moves forward, a benefit has been organized for July at which a raffle and auction will be held to benefit the Johnsons financially. 

Friends of the family have also set up a GoFundMe page, where donations can be made to help the family offset the cost of medical bills.
