The headmistress of an all-girls private school has told her students to shun celebrities like Miley Cyrus - and idolise a former mayor instead.

Charlotte Avery has been head of £30,000-a-year St Mary's School in Cambridge since 2007 and champions equality for women.

She fears her pupils at the Roman Catholic school are being starved of appropriate role models with pop stars like Rihanna and Miley Cyrus, as well as models and WAGs, getting too much 'toxic' media attention.

Step aside: Charlotte Avery, left, head of St Mary's School in Cambridge, says former mayor of the city Sheila Stuart is 'a better role model than Miley Cyrus', right, who presents a distorted view of body image and reality

She warns that stars are heavily airbrushed and advises girls to look closer to home, at aunts and grandmothers, for inspiration on how to carry themselves.

Her latest tip is for the girls to see former Cambridge mayor Sheila Stuart as a role model instead of the controversial Wrecking Ball singer.

Mrs Avery said: 'I do think we want a variety of role models out there, not simply models or pop stars or footballers' wives.

'We actually want women who have an identity of their own, say for example sportswomen.

'They are advocating a lifestyle which is one of dedication and hard work and that actually failure along the way is part of the route to success.

'I think we need to look at female role models in public life so last year we invited in Sheila Stuart, who had been mayor of Cambridge twice.

'I think we need to be looking at women locally, so celebrate your mother or your sister within families.

'Who are the role models we aspire to? A grandmother, an aunt.

An education: Mrs Avery warns the girls at the £30,000-a-year Catholic school are bombarded with distorted images of women living a lifestyle outside of the norm. We should celebrate our sisters, she says

'It's important to get local role models, models within a town or city.

'At
 the moment there is a gross under representation of the majority of 
types of people and a gross over representation of a very false image 
and I think for a society that is very toxic.'

It
 follows a wave of criticism from prominent figures such as actress Emma
 Thompson lamenting Cyrus' high profile status in the media.

However, many accept that little can be done to change that.

Thompson said: ‘She made the choice of going hyper-sexual for a reason, and we’re all responsible for that, because that’s what we buy, and that’s what we click on. Those quick clicks are dangerous.’

But Mrs Avery refuses to accept the status quo.

She told Cambridge News: 'I’m not saying there’s anything wrong with Miley Cyrus and Rihanna per se, it’s just we don’t get anything else at all. There’s no dilution of that.'
