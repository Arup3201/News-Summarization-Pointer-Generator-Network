His own magazine had a field day with the topless pictures of the Duchess of Cambridge. But now Silvio Berlusconi is himself suing a gossip magazine for publishing another intimate collection of photos, taken at a similarly secluded Mediterranean villa.

The billionaire politician is demanding £85,000 compensation from Oggi magazine for publishing compromising pictures of him embracing five young women at his villa in Sardinia.

Chi, which forms a part of the former Italian premier's Mondadori publishing empire, last year printed no fewer than 27 pictures of Kate and William on their private holiday at a chateau in Provence.

The magazine, which has a usual weekly circulation of 340,000, hit Italian news stands last September, led by the sensationalist headline 'The Queen is naked'.

At least 12 of the pictures showed the duchess semi-nude - including some not published in France.

The magazine also published a tasteless article by a plastic surgeon assessing Kate's physique. Chi went to press in spite of Palace pleas for restraint and even though legal action against the French magazine Closer, which first published the pictures, had already begun.

At the time the royal couple issued a statement saying they were 'shocked and saddened' by the intrusion.

Privately William was said to be 'furious' particularly as it was not the first time the magazine had him grief. In 2006 Chi had published near-death pictures of Princess Diana.

Now in an astonishing display of hypocrisy the former Italian premier is now demanding compensation for the collection of pictures at his luxurious Sardinian home Villa Certosa, which he says unfairly described him as having 'a harem' of women around him.

The pictures, which showed the then Prime Minister caressing multiple young women, were printed in the weekly magazine in April 2007, before the other sex scandals involving Berlusconi broke.

The editor at-the-time Pino Belleri could face up to 17 months in prison on charges of a breach of privacy. However defence lawyers told a Milan court on Friday that the editor had acted 'in the public interest' by printing the pictures.

She added that Berlusconi's daughter Marina, president of his Mondadori publishing arm, had also been acting 'in the public interest' when Chi printed the intimate photographs of Kate.

The verdict is expected on March 1.

Meanwhile the photographer Antonello Zappadu is facing justice in a separate trial in Sardinia for breaking and entering and breach of privacy.
