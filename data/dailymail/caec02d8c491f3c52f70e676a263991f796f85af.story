A friend of Aaron Hernandez appeared in a surveillance video with a towel that was found near the body of a man the former New England Patriots star is accused of murdering in 2013, a defense attorney said on Tuesday.

Defense attorney James Sultan asked North Attleboro police officer John Grim about footage taken at a gas station and convenience store hours before the body of semiprofessional football player Odin Lloyd was found in an industrial park near Hernandez's Massachusetts house.

'Are you aware that there is video surveillance footage ... taken at about 2am on June 17, 2013, showing Carlos Ortiz with a white towel around his neck?' he asked during cross-examination of Grim, who said he was unaware of it.

Prosecutors say Ortiz was one of two friends who were with Hernandez when they picked up Lloyd at his Boston home on June 17, 2013, and drove him to the industrial area where his body was found later that day.

Ortiz and the other friend, Ernest Wallace, have also been charged in Lloyd's slaying and will be tried separately. All three men have pleaded not guilty.

Investigators have testified they found a white towel on the ground near Lloyd's bullet-riddled body, which was discovered by a teenage jogger. 

Other items found near the body included a Boston Red Sox baseball hat, a marijuana cigarette known as a blunt and several empty shell casings from a .45-caliber handgun.

Sultan said the towel seen in the video was the one found near Lloyd's body.

Lloyd, 27, had been dating Shaneah Jenkins, the sister of Hernandez's fiancée, at the time. 

Jenkins has testified that the two men were in the early stages of a friendship and smoked marijuana together.

Hernandez, 25, had a $41 million contract with the New England Patriots when he was arrested on murder and firearms charges. The team cut him hours later.

If convicted, he faces a maximum sentence of life in prison.

Hernandez will face a second trial later this year on charges he killed two Cape Verdean men outside a Boston nightclub in 2012.

The jury on Tuesday also was shown surveillance video of Hernandez dismantling his cell phone a day after Lloyd's murder. 

His fiancée, Shayanna Jenkins, was in court in Fall River, Massachusetts on Tuesday where she sat behind Hernandez. He mouthed 'I love you' to her as she walked in, Fox reported. 

Veteran Detective Michael Elliot, from the North Attleboro Police Department, testified on Tuesday that after Hernandez was questioned on June 18, he watched on the police CCTV as the pro-football player broke up the phone. 

Last Friday, Judge Susan Garsh said she'd allow the jury to see video of Hernandez sitting in a lawyer's car outside the North Attleboro, Massachusetts, police station the day after the killing. 

The defense had fought to prevent the video tape being admitted to evidence but the judge said that Hernandez had no expectation of privacy while sitting in a public parking lot.  

Prosecutors said it shows Hernandez dismantling his phone, getting a new phone from the lawyer and using it to call a co-defendant.  

Prosecutors claim that Hernandez was seen using the phone and calling co-defendant Ernest Wallace, in a deliberate attempt to assist him. 

Judge Garsh said on Friday that the jury would not be told where the phone came from, just that it didn't belong to Hernandez. 

The technician who installed Hernandez's home theater and security system also took the stand on Tuesday.

Mark Archambault said that when he was installing the six cameras in May 2013, Hernandez asked how to turn off the camera in the basement because he didn't want his girlfriend to see him hanging out with his friends.

Jurors were also shown a number of evidence photos on Tuesday - including a shell casing found in a dumpster at the Enterprise car rental where Hernandez had hired a vehicle on the night Lloyd was shot and killed. 

Last week, Hernandez's 25-year-old fiancée Shayanna Jenkins was granted immunity in the trial - a move likely made so that prosecutors can call her to testify.

The grant of immunity may mean that the football player's girlfriend will not be able to invoke her Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination if she takes the witness stand.

Prosecutors have said Jenkins lied to a grand jury dozens of times including when she said she didn't know what she did with a box she took from the basement of their home.

They say it contained possible evidence leading to Mr Lloyd's killer. Jenkins has pleaded not guilty to perjury. 

Jenkins still lives in Hernandez's North Attleboro mansion with their two-year-old daughter.
