The first openly-gay boxer, Puerto Rican featherweight Orlando Cruz, is engaged after proposing to his boyfriend in an emotional video posted to Facebook.

The 32-year-old sportsman, who came out last year, addressed his long-term boyfriend José Manuel in the film posted on his profile on Wednesday.

'Through the ups and downs we've had, you've always been there for [me],' he said in Spanish. 'I want to tell you that you are a very 
special person in my life.

'I am a little nervous, but I want to tell you
 and share with your friends and my friends if you want to marry me? I want to share my life with you and want to be with you always, and support you 100 per cent, and you support me 100 per cent. I like you a lot, I love you and I look forward to your answer.'

Manuel responded in his own teary video to accept Cruz's proposal, NBA Latino reported.

'I want to say yes,' he said. 'I accept marrying you because I love you and adore you. Yes, I do want to marry you because I love you, I love you, I love you very much. We will keep going forward and you will see how happy we will be. I love you papi from my heart.'

After seeing the video, Cruz responded: 'Omg! Now you've made cry.'

Both videos have since been removed from Facebook.

But Cruz also mentioned the happy news on Twitter, saying that he had taken an important step in his life and that he wants happiness for him and his partner as a couple.

It is unclear where the couple will marry as same-sex marriages are not allowed in Puerto Rico or 
Florida, where Cruz also has a home.

Earlier this year, Cruz revealed he realized he was a homosexual man as a 19-year-old after he competed in the 2000 Sydney Olympics.

He told the New York 
Daily News that though he had a girlfriend in 2000, he experienced his 
first sexual encounter with a man after he had 
competed in Sydney.

The experience was disorienting for the athlete, who struggled to come to terms with how to face the truth.

'I was wondering, "What is wrong with me? Am I crazy? What is going on?"' Cruz told the News.

Cruz says that he kept his identity a secret but decided to open up to 
his family and close friends in 2010. He came out to the public in 
October 2012.

Proud: Cruz, 32, said he knew he was gay when he was 19. He came out last year

Happy: After he decided to be honest about his sexuality, he said he felt: 'I'm free, I'm free'

Cruz said he met with psychologists 
and others before making the announcement, adding he has the full 
support of his family, trainer and manager.

'I am free. I feel so free,' he said about his state of
 mind in the aftermath of his decision to be open about his identity.

Cruz, who began boxing at the age
 of seven, holds the WBO NABO featherweight title.

While few sportsmen have come out as gay, the proposal comes as WWE superstar Darren Young this week became the first professional wrestler to reveal he is gay.

Young's announcement was greeted with encouragement by WWE: 'WWE is proud of Darren Young for being open about his sexuality, and we will continue to support him as a WWE Superstar.'
