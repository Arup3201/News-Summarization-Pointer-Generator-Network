England were beaten 31-28 by South Africa on Saturday, extending their winless run against the Springboks to 12 games.

Here, Sportsmail looks at five things we learned from Twickenham.

South Africa celebrate the only try of the first half during their 31-28 victory over England on Saturday

Too many unforced errors - England must make most of pressure

It's an all-too-familiar story for England fans, but again the hosts at Twickenham dominated possession and had the majority of the territory against the Springboks.

But fumbled balls, especially in the first-half, cost Stuart Lancaster's side time and time again. New Zealand would have capitalised more than South Africa too, which is a worrying thought.

Time for Ford

England's kicking let them down again on Saturday, and although you can never doubt Owen Farrell's goal-kicking, it is perhaps time for George Ford to enter the fray permanently.

The 21-year-old can control the tempo and has the creativity to unlock defences, even though he may not have quite proved it in his brief substitute appearance.

South Africa hoodoo

The Springboks are the second best side in the world, undoubtedly, but 12 games without a win against them is turning into an England hoodoo.

Unlike the hosts, South Africa were clinical when they entered the opposition's 22, and were in fact only really troubled when they were a man down in the second-half.

Changes for Samoa

Three-point defeats may sound like they are narrow, but the visitors were much better than England on Saturday. It was a similar story against New Zealand, and Lancaster surely must look to freshen things up against Samoa.

Marland Yarde and Ben Youngs could be options, with the Leicester half-back impressing after replacing Danny Care.

Unfortunate debut for Anthony Watson

The young winger couldn't quite show fans what he was about at Twickenham. This wasn't helped by some lazy decision-making from Farrell early on, who flicked an inside ball towards the younster by his own corner with two South African defenders closing in. Three points would follow.

With the vast amount of options to return after this series, Watson may have to wait for his next big chance on the international stage.
