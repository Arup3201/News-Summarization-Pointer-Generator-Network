The Chancellor launched the second big sell-off of Lloyds shares last night - raising hopes that British taxpayers could get their money back.

The Treasury authorised the sale of a 7.5pc stake in the UK's largest bank, in a move expected to raise more than £4billion.

The sale of 5.4billion shares will reduce taxpayers' stake in the giant lender from 32.7pc to around 25pc, and marks the biggest step towards re-privatisation taken so far.

Chancellor of the Exchequer George Osborne has agreed the sale of a further 7.5 per cent of the Government's shares in Lloyds

An announcement on the completion of the sale is expected today.

Four investment banks appointed by the Treasury, including JPMogan, were instructed to approach giant institutional investors, including pension funds last night.

Based on the bank's closing price of 79.11p, the latest sale is expected to raise about £4.2 billion.

But the Treasury is only expected to make a small profit.

Lloyds received a £20billion bail out from taxpayers during the height of the financial crisis in 2008.

George Osborne has pledged to get taxpayers' money back, meaning he has to sell the shares at above the 73.6p 'break even' price paid by the previous government.

The Treasury began its disposal of Lloyds shares last September with the sale of a 6pc stake in the bank for £3.2billion.

But Mr Osborne's claims to have made a profit were rejected by spending watchdog the National Audit Office, which said the country made a £230million loss.

For the second time, ordinary retail investors will not be able to take part in the Lloyds shares sale.

It is thought that the Treasury and UKFI – the arms length body which manages taxpayers' stakes in bailed out bans – believes a retail offer is still too risky.

Although the UK economy appears to be recovering, Treasury insiders said the 'global situation is less certain'. It is thought that the Treasury hopes to involve retail investors in the next sale and is targeting the Autumn.

John O'Connell, director of the Taxpayers' Alliance said:

'We're very keen that Lloyds and RBS are put back into private hands as soon as possible – as long as taxpayers get a good deal. Politicians have been tampering with banks for too long.'

Hopes the Government could start re-privatising Royal Bank of Scotland have receded after the lender slumped to a £8.2billion loss last year.
