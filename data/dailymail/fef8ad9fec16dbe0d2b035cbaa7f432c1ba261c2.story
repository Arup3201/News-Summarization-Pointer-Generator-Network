Katie Archibald and Laura Trott won golds on Sunday as Great Britain completed the European Elite Track Cycling Championships in Guadeloupe with an eight-medal haul, six of them gold.

Trott retained her European omnium title and Archibald took the three-kilometre individual pursuit title, to add to the team crown she won with Trott on Thursday.

The results from a European Championships taking place on a 333.3-metre concrete track in the Caribbean - Guadeloupe is a French colony - provided key Olympic qualifying points on the road to Rio 2016.
