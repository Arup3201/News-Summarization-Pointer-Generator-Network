They are often dismissed as pesky birds that spread disease - but to one couple these homing pigeons were their livelihood.

And now Maria and Alberta Morales have seen their pension pot disappear into thin air, after 1,000 of their 2,200 birds were stolen.

Thieves stole hundreds of the valuable 
homing pigeons from the Marion County farm in Orlando, and slaughtered 
100 baby birds more - effectively losing the couple nearly $20,000.

Thieves stole hundreds of the valuable homing pigeons from the Marion County farm

The owners believe those who took the birds knew how valuable they are - but cannot understand why they would have killed 100 of the birds.

'There is a huge demand for them,' Maria Morales told the Orlando Sentinel.

'We have live-animal auctions (in Marion County). Every time you go to an auction, if you have pigeons you know for sure you will sell them out.'

The birds were used for both racing and for recreational purposes.

The couple believe whoever stole the pigeons drove through their neighbor's open field

Stolen: The owners believe those who took the birds knew how valuable they are

The pair hoped the farm, which they began in 2012, would fund their retirement, WFTV reported.

The couple believe whoever stole the pigeons drove through their neighbor's open field, which leads to the back of the coop.

Since then, the couple accumulated about 2,200 birds, which sell on average for $18, and were far more valuable as they can breed more birds.

Because the family will lose out on up to four breedings this year, the value of the theft is actually closer to $40,000.
