In her stylish black-and-white outfit, Emilia d’Erlanger cut a striking figure at last month’s Royal christening.

Of Prince George’s seven godparents she is, perhaps, the least well known: an unfamiliar face among even seasoned royal watchers.

Though a close confidante of both the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge for many years, the elegant interior designer rarely flaunts her intimate friendship with the young Royals, and is happy to remain discreetly in the background.

Yet since William and Kate married, Emilia’s influence and advice has become invaluable to them, making her one of their most trusted and respected companions – so much so that she is known as ‘Kate’s secret stylist’ among the Duchess’s circle.

Emilia, 31, who has known Kate since she was 13, has overseen all Kate’s public outfits of late.

She chose the Alexander McQueen suit that Kate, also 31, wore to the christening, and slowly but surely is now moving the Duchess into new fashion territory.

Emilia is cajoling Kate to embrace patterned and colourful fabrics while encouraging her away from the bland neutral palates that she naturally favours. Emilia herself admires vintage style and is keen to see Kate experiment with quirkier outfits.

According to their friends, Emilia – who uses her maiden name despite being married to banking heir David Jardine-Paterson – regularly passes on fashion tips to the style-conscious Duchess and points her in the direction of up-and-coming fashion houses and designers.

‘Emilia is cool and trendy and she has a great eye,’ says one friend. ‘Kate has always loved her style and she trusts her advice.’

And it isn’t only Kate’s fashion sense that her loyal friend is redesigning. Emilia is also helping the Royal  couple design the interior of their home at Kensington Palace.

William and Kate moved into Apartment 1A in early October after a year of renovations. According to friends, Emilia is a frequent visitor and has spent hours going through glossy interior design magazines and ‘look books’ with Kate.

Such is the couple’s faith in her taste that she has also been asked to help acquire furnishings for Anmer Hall, their home on the Sandringham estate in Norfolk, which is currently undergoing a refurbishment.

It is clear that Emilia is a significant figure in the Royal inner circle and her influence has grown over many years.

In fact, it is down to Emilia that William and Kate are together, as she introduced them when they were fresh-faced 17-year-olds.

When the Duchess of Cambridge was pictured with unflattering streaks of grey last week, it was a marked contrast with her normally immaculate look.

It was also a clue to the trendy new colouring technique that attracted attention at Prince George’s christening.

The Mail on Sunday can reveal that she has been having a £350 colouring treatment known as balayage – a technique that involves ‘painting’ the hair with ammonia-free dye to give a natural look.

It is popular with celebrities including Kate Moss and Sienna Miller.

But, as last week’s pictures make clear, balayage colour can fade quickly on brunettes – and Kate has already summoned her hairdresser for a touch-up.

While it has long been believed that they met at St Andrews in 2001, when both were first-year undergraduates, friends say Emilia engineered their first meeting in the summer of 1999.

She and Kate were already long-standing school friends at Marlborough and Emilia was part of the ‘Glosse Posse’ who would socialise with William and Harry at Highgrove.

Some believe it was that meeting that prompted Kate to turn down her place at Edinburgh University (where Emilia studied) and re-apply to St Andrews where she enrolled on the same History of Art course and lived in the same halls of residence as William.

Though she has been discreet, Emilia has always been a key player in William and Kate’s elite social set.

Having maintained close friendships with them both during those formative university years when their romance blossomed, it was Emilia who advised Kate on how to cope during the break in their courtship back in April 2007.

She whisked Kate off to Ibiza for a 
week of sun and fun to help mend her broken heart – and to show William 
what he was missing.

However, Emilia’s friendship with William far predates her role as Kate’s confidante and adviser.

She was a childhood friend of William and Harry, and during her Marlborough days, Emilia went on a cruise of the Greek islands with the Princes and Prince Charles.

She was so close to the young William, who was at Eton at the time, that it was reported that they were dating.

Those close to Emilia say she and William were never romantically involved and sources close to the Duchess say Kate trusts her oldest school friend implicitly.
