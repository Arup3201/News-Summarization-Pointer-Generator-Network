Paul Smith is confident he can exact revenge on Arthur Abraham in their Berlin rematch this weekend.

The Liverpool super-middleweight was left stunned when Abraham was given the nod in their first fight last September by unanimous decision.

Although the fight was close, the judges awarded the world champion victory by six and 10 rounds.

Smith is confident he can beat WBO super-middleweight world champion Abraham on Saturday

'I'm extremely confident,' said Smith. 'I went into the first fight believing I could beat Abraham, this time I go into the fight knowing I can beat him. 

'I know what I am in with now and I'm 100 per cent confident I will win. He won't be able to rely on the judges this time.

'I do believe Abraham will be fitter this time, he will come to fight and that is exactly what I've prepared for. I'm certainly fitter and better than last time too, and I've improved technically. 

'The first fight for me was a chance to prove that I belong at world level. Although, I didn't get the decision, I felt I beat him and I got a massive confidence boost from that. I now know I belong at world level and I know I can mix it with the best.'
