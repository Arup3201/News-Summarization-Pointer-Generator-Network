In 1840, the students of Durham were banned from local pubs, forced to wear gowns wherever they walked and even prohibited from entering sweet shops.

But these rules were often broken - and the riotous alcohol-fuelled life associated with many students today was just as prevalent as 170 years ago.

These days were documented in a fascinating set of comic strips about the raucous life of Victorian Durham University theology student Edward Bradley.

The comic strips, written under the pen name of 'Cuthbert Bede', detail the alcohol-fuelled life of Victorian Durham University theology student Edward Bradley

The 18-year-old created the semi-autobiographical strips about the adventures of a ‘freshmonne’ - the predecessor to a first-year ‘fresher’ of today.

They show how he was overawed upon his arrival in the city and was 'by no means certain as to where on earth he can be going' in an omnibus.

Later on the student is encouraged over dinner to the 'freshman's wine' and 'finds the reality far beyond his expectation' when he becomes drunk.

He is then 'assisted to his own rooms' by other students and 'passes an uneasy night on his hearth-rug' before the maid finds him there in the morning.

The strips - written under the pen 
name of 'Cuthbert Bede' - were found in a city library and restored by 
Alex Morgan, 20, of Guildford, Surrey.

The
second-year theology student at Durham University discovered them while
working on a film project about the city entitled The Durham Story.

Universities acted like a parent in the 1840s, according to Mr Morgan, with servants even making sure students' lights were turned out at night. Pictured is a drawing of a university boat crew dinner

He told MailOnline: ‘I stumbled across them in the archives and thought they were cracking. This guy has frozen in time a window on student life.

‘This is freshers’ week, 1840s-style. As a “freshmonne” he matriculated here in 1845 and graduated in 1848.

‘He goes off to dinner and sketches a
very naive young fresher. He probably thinks the other guys are taking 
advantage of him. The cleaner then finds him face down on the rug.’

Mr Morgan said universities acted like a
parent in the 1840s. ‘You had a bedtime and servants went round to make
sure your light was turned off,’ he added.

Modern-day Durham University students set a trend last December for 'Porting', which involved pouring bottles of Port over their heads while being filmed

The Durham students started the trend as an answer to the 'Milking' video from students at rival Newcastle University, which saw students pour milk over their heads in a similar fashion

Modern-day Durham University students 
set a trend last December for ‘Porting’, which involved pouring bottles 
of Port over their heads for a video.

It was an answer to the ‘Milking’ 
video from students at rival Newcastle University, which saw students 
pour milk over their heads in a similar fashion.

Mr
Morgan pointed out that Victorian students came up with equally bizarre
ideas in their spare time, such as trying to wake up as many citizens 
of the city as possible at night.

‘Alcohol is not a new thing - if 
anything, you would have more alcohol then, with every meal. The 
students had a lot of time on their hands'

- Student Alex Morgan

He said: ‘Students would climb to the top of the castle keep and would take their hunting horn. One bloke used to blow his horn across the city and see how many people he could wake up.

‘He kept a score chart with his friends. You got one point for getting someone out of bed and three points for getting someone out of bed with a nightcap on.

‘Alcohol is not a new thing - if anything, you would have more alcohol then, with every meal. The students had a lot of time on their hands. 

‘They weren’t allowed out of college 
after 10pm. But the students used to sneak out for the evening and would
get back late and were shut out.

‘They could either scale the wall or ring the bell for the warden - and then face their wrath in the morning.

It is not only modern-day students who spend their spare time coming up with bizarre ideas - students throughout the ages have been involved in odd trends

In the past, Durham students set a trend for trying to wake up as many citizens of the city as possible at night

‘The young men here would have wanted to get into mischief, but they weren’t allowed into local bars and would have to wear their gowns wherever they go.’

He added: ‘But from the very first years there are records of students breaking both those rules in one go - and then being caught.

‘The original rules of the university were very strict – how well they were lived out was debatable. Also the playing of dice, cards and gambling were banned, or going into a confectionery shop.’

Mr Bradley went on to be an Anglican priest. The comic strips pictured here formed the basis for a bestselling novel he later had printed called The Adventures of Mr Verdant Green.
