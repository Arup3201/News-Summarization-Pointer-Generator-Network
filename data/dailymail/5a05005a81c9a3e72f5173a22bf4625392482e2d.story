Ford has developed a ‘crash-proof’ car in a bid to help drivers avoid collisions with pedestrians or other vehicles.

It’ll even park itself.

The new ‘obstacle avoidance’ technology means that if a pedestrian steps out, or if a slow moving vehicle looms into view, the car will take avoiding action if the driver  fails to do so in time.

The new 'obstacle avoidance' technology means that if a pedestrian steps out, or if a slow moving vehicle looms into view, the car will take avoiding action if the driver fails to do so in time

The on-board computer simply wrests control of the steering wheel and brakes to help avoid the impending bump.

The technology is being tested on a Ford Focus and is expected to be on showroom models within five years.

It has been tested at speeds of more than 38 mph following  research which reveals that fewer than a third of drivers about to hit the car in front attempt to steer out of the way ahead of impact.

The technology was demonstrated for the first time at the company’s proving grounds at Lommel in Belgium. 

The system uses three radars, ultrasonic sensors and a camera to ‘scan’ the road up to 200 yards ahead.

A Ford spokesman said: ‘If the system detects a slow-moving or stationary object in the lane ahead it first displays a warning and then sounds a chime.

‘Then,  if the driver does not steer or brake then the car will apply the brakes automatically whilst scanning for gaps either side of the hazard – effectively taking control of the electronic power steering to avoid any near-fatal collisions. ‘

The automatic steering and braking enables the car to move away from objects that the driver may not have seen or that have slowed down ahead of them

The car is also fitted with the next-generation parking technology which, at the push of a button, operates steering, gear selection and forward and reverse motion

The car is also fitted with the next-generation parking technology which, at the push of a button, operates steering, gear selection and forward and reverse motion. It can even be operated from outside the car by remote control.

Barb Samardzich, Ford of Europe’s vice president of product development said: ‘There are many instances – such as unexpectedly queuing traffic ahead – when this technology could benefit both the driver whose car is equipped with the technology and others on the road.

‘The Obstacle Avoidance research project offers an exciting glimpse of a safer future where the risk of some types of accidents could be greatly reduced.’

She added: ’Ford Motor Company has always been one of the world’s leading pioneers and forward-thinkers.  

‘From the introduction of a whole new way of mass producing cars 100 years ago to the advanced safety and convenience features unveiled today, we continue to set the template and define the future for drivers.’

Ford is leading a consortium of 29 partners in a research project called ‘interactIVe’  - Accident Avoidance by Active Intervention of Intelligent Vehicles – designed to make cars intervene in the event of an imminent collision.
