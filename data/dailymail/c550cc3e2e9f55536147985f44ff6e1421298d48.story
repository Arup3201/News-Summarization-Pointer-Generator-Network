A mother and son are accused of brutally beating a man she met on a dating site with a hammer and a baseball bat then robbing his house and stealing his car.

Florida woman Bobbie Jo Curtis, 40, and her 16-year-old Bryan Curtis have been charged with attempted murder, unlawful imprisonment, aggravated battery and grand theft auto in the savage attack, which left the unnamed boyfriend fighting for his life.

Pasco County police say Curtis recently met the 44-year-old on dating website Singlesnet.com and within a few days of their first meeting he'd opened up his Moon Lake Estates home to the woman and her son.

On Friday, the pair, and an accomplice, Vanessa Musson, allegedly tied the boyfriend to a chair in the dining room and beat him until he revealed the combination to his safe and the PIN to his Bank of America account.

They then stole a collection of guns from his house and several other items including a flat-screen TV, piling the haul into the man's white Ford Econoline van.

A 69-year-old neighbour heard the commotion and went to check on the man but the suspects beat him in the head with the hammer and baseball bat too, police said.

After he regained consciousness, he called 911.

When officers arrived at the property, Curtis and her son were gone but a tipster spotted the stolen van at a hotel in New Port Richey on Saturday and the alleged attackers were accosted.

However, Musson, a heavily tattooed woman in her 20s, got away in the vehicle, which has Florida license plate 366-TQH.

'We will not stop until she's arrested,' Sheriff Chris Nocco said at a press conference.

'We do not want any more violence. We want her to turn herself in peacefully. The walls are closing in.'

Bobbie Jo Curtis has been arrested 14 times in the last 11 years for alleged crimes including robbery, battery, and dealing prescription drugs, according to the Tampa Bay Times.

Her 16-year-old son is being tried as an adult. Both he and his mother are being held in Pasco County jail.

Deputies found the man in a pool of blood in his home with severe head injuries.

On Saturday, he remained in critical condition.

The neighbour suffered a broken jaw and concussion and was also rushed to hospital.

Singlesnet.com promotes itself with the slogan 'online dating, made easy.'

But Nocco cautioned people to keep their wits about them when using internet dating sites.

'Be careful with who you are talking to,' he said. 'You don't know who is on the other end.'
