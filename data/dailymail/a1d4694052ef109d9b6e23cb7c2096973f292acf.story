A Towie fan who who ran away to Syria with her toddler son has escaped from the clutches of ISIS and fled to Turkey after begging border guards not to shoot her.

Tareena Shakil from Burton-on-Trent in Staffordshire, crossed into Syria last year after telling relatives she was going on holiday to Spain with her young son Zaheem.

But after becoming disillusioned with the fanatical regime, the 25-year-old has crossed back over the Turkish border where she is now being held by authorities.

Shakil, a former Morrisons worker, fled to the ISIS stronghold city of Raqqa in November last year. 

From there, she posted fanatical messages and sent selfies to family in Britain, telling relatives she and her young son would never return.   

West Midlands Police confirmed the young mother was being held by Turkish authorities who are working alongside British forces. Still considered a missing person, it is understood Shakil will be returned to the UK.  

'We are aware a missing British woman travelling from Syria has been detained by Turkish authorities for immigration matters,' a spokesman for West Midlands Police told MailOnline.

'Police are working with the Turkish authorities to ensure her safe return the UK.' 

In November the former Morrisons worker posted this selfie with her son from her home in an ISIS stronghold of the pair of them smiling

Her reported escape from Raqqa comes just two months after she posted a selfie with her son from her home inside the ISIS stronghold.

It has been claimed the young mother fled fanatics after being attacked by a would-be suitor.  

A family friend of Shakil told the Sun's Dan Sales: 'They tried to force her to marry a man and when she refused he attacked her.

'She decided she couldn't take it anymore, broke into a property and stole her passport.

'The border guards didn't fire for some reason - maybe because she was carrying her son. Her hands were hurt and her feet cut to ribbons climbing the fence.'

Previously her father Mohammed, 42, said she sent him the picture to show they had arrived but she has since cut off all contact.

He has told of how his daughter was a one-time Spice Girls fan, school prefect and Girl Guide and was so fascinated with the ITV reality show The Only Way Is Essex, that she travelled 150 miles to buy clothes at a shop run by one of its stars.

Her parents said she was wearing items she bought there when she set off for Syria in October.

Mr Shakil said his daughter did a psychology degree and got married, although she later divorced.

But around six months ago she set up a Facebook page under the name Tameena al Amirah and started posting extremist messages, including images of Islamist fighters and the ISIS black flag, and calling herself a 'slave to Allah'.

After fleeing, Shakil told her family how she was in Raqqa and could never return to the UK.

In one message she wrote: 'I can't come back there now … we can't. Tell her don't cry. Read the Koran, I love you mummy!'

Friends say that she wanted to flee from the ISIS stronghold of Raqqa because the group were going to force her to marry a jihadi 

And of her journey, she said: 'So many people died coming. They got shot at the border. But we made it. We ran across the border in the blazing sun.' 

Despite posting extremist material online, Shakil is still being considered a person of interest by the authorities and may not face criminal charges.

Social services have not been involved by British forces with regard to her young son's care.  

'All decisions on returnees from Syria or Iraq are taken on a case-by-case basis,' a spokesman for the Home Office said. 

'Some of these people may have been exposed to traumatic experiences and others may be radicalised or vulnerable to radicalisation. 

'For some, prosecution for terrorist offences is the right course of action. 

'For others, it may be that support from, for example, mental health or social services, is more appropriate.'
