The Ebola screening system at airports has been toughened up after Pauline Cafferkey, who later developed the virus, was waived through

The Ebola screening system at airports has been toughened up after a nurse who later developed the virus was waived through.

Nurse Pauline Cafferkey is fighting for her life after being diagnosed with Ebola last Monday having spent five weeks treating victims in Sierra Leone.

It later emerged that officials at Heathrow had allowed her to board a connecting flight to Glasgow even though she had complained of a fever.

Health secretary Jeremy Hunt yesterday announced that officials had introduced more rigorous checks for doctors and nurses returning to the UK following volunteer work.

Until recently, the screening only involved them having their temperature taken and filling-in a questionnaire about whether they have come into contact with patients.

But from now on, anyone who thinks they are mildly unwell will be kept on and made to undergo further checks even if their temperature seems normal.

Officials will also seek advice from tropical disease experts and monitor the patient closely for a number of hours.

Pauline Cafferkey, 39, from Glasgow, remains in a critical but stable state at a special isolation unit at the Royal Free Hospital in North London.

Addressing the House of Commons yesterday, Mr Hunt said: 'Pauline's condition has deteriorated to a critical state although she stabilised yesterday and continues to receive the best possible care.'

'She said in Sierra Leone that she hoped her loved ones would be proud of her.

'Well, she should know today the whole country is proud of her for her bravery and dedication to the service of others.

'She stands, quite simply, for the very best of NHS values.'
