The United States is said to have told Nato allies that Russia has been testing a new ground-launched cruise missile, despite Moscow being prohibited from carrying out such tests thanks to a 30-year-old treaty.

Rose Gottemoeler, the U.S. state 
department’s senior arms control official, has reportedly 
asked Russian officials about the tests on several occasions since May last year .

The department believes the flight tests could have been going on for up to six years.

Tension: The United States (president Barack Obama, pictured) has accused Russia (president Vladimir Putin, pictured) of testing a new ground-launched cruise missile, in breach of a treaty signed by the nations in 1987

The 1987 treaty, signed by Ronald Reagan and Mikhail Gorbachev, was seen as a major factor in bringing an end to the Cold War (stock picture)

Russia is said to have responded by saying that the matter has been investigated and the case is now closed.

According to the New York Times, President Barack Obama is not yet ready to officially declare the tests. The situation comes at a time when he is pledging to make further cuts in nuclear arms.

A state department spokesman told the paper there would be no hesitation to ‘raise treaty compliance concerns with Russia, and this issue is no exception’.

Jen Psaki, the State Department spokesman, added: 'There’s an ongoing review process, and we wouldn’t want to speculate or prejudge the outcome.'

There have been a number of disputes between Washington and Moscow in recent months, including over Edward Snowden's temporary asylum in Russia

Other officials have reportedly said it is clear the tests were non-compliant with the 1987 treaty. The White House is said to be being pressured into forming a firmer response.

Ronald Reagan and Mikhail Gorbachev, 
then the presidents of the U.S. and Soviet Union, signed a treaty 
banning medium-range missiles in 1987.

The treaty banning the testing, production and possession of medium-range missiles was regarded as an important milestone in putting the brakes on the U.S. and Russian arms race and was a key contributor in ending the Cold War.

Medium range missiles are ground-launched ballistic or cruise missiles that have a flying range of 300-3,400 miles. Intercontinental missiles can fly beyond that range.

This situation is the latest in a long line of disputes between the two nations in recent months.

Last year, the Washington and Moscow clashed over Edward Snowden’s temporary asylum in Russia and the crisis in Syria.

More recently, conflict in Ukraine has caused tensions to rise between the countries.
