It dominates their lives, soaring thousands of feet above their village, threatening to unleash its awesome fury at any moment.

Those living in the shadow of Popocatepetl, Mexico's most active volcano, have learned to respect the 17,886ft fiery mountain, knowing it can wipe out their homes with little warning.

With that in mind, locals embark on a pilgrimage every March, climbing its slopes to offer gifts of food and ask 'Don Goyo', as it's also known, to spare them from eruptions.

When the sun rises, hundreds head out from the towns of Santiago Xalintzintla, Tlamacas and San Nicolas de Los Ranchos, in central Mexico, for a daylong celebration, armed with grapes, corn, watermelon, chicken and plenty of tequila.

Villagers with clarinets, trombones, tubas and drums fill the air with music and the pilgrims participate in hours of song, prayer, fireworks and dancing.

At nightfall, they head back down Popocatepetl's slopes, hoping it will 'remain happy and at peace'.
