A British student tipped for football stardom in Bulgaria had his signing with a top club delayed - after he mispronounced a word and they thought he had Ebola.

Trainee doctor CJ Burke had been studying medicine in the  country when he was spotted playing by the country's top scout.

But the 21-year-old was forced to delay signing with PFC Beroe Stara Zagora, who played in the Europa League last season, because of a language mix-up which landed him in quarantine.

During a training session, he attempted to say he was feeling ill with the Bulgarian word 'Bolen'. Instead, he caused a panic when the club thought he was trying to say he had Ebola.

'They put me and my friend in quarantine for four days,' said Burke. 'It was a nightmare.

'The worse thing is, I was quarantined in the hospital I was training at and my teachers were my doctors. And the food was vile.'

CJ had moved to Bulgaria and quitting East Sussex university when he realised his biomedical sciences degree would not allow him to later convert into medicine, and began looking up cheap medical courses online.

The 21-year-old, originally from London, eventually settled on Trakia University, in the city of Stara Zagora, because of the bargain fees and moved there in September.

'I was scouted by my university PE teacher, who used to play football in the U.S,' he said.

'He told me to come along to a few training sessions - I did well and was negotiating a contract with them.

'But I have been left contractless though. I was meant to sign one but I was put in quarantine.'

The midfielder trained Fulham F.C.'s youth academy between the ages of 14-16 and his life-long ambition to be a pro was shattered when they released him.

But not he says he has been given another 'lifeline' to his dream.

The 21-year-old will have another opportunity to sign with PFC Beroe Stara Zagora later this month

'I'm going to see how far I can get,' he added. 'I came back to England for Christmas but I will be negotiating a contract when I go back later this month.'

Despite the Ebola knockback at the end of November, he remains a hero in the city.

He said: 'Now I'm a bit of a cult figure and everyone asks if they can be my agent. 'I'm swarmed by girls.'

Girlfriend Lily Smith, 24, of north London, does not get jealous of the women throwing themselves however.

Burke said: 'She's over the moon about it. She thinks she's a right WAG now.'

He is now due to sign for PFC Beroe Stara Zagora later this month is already being handed the celeb treatment.

He said: 'When we arrived we were greeted by a fanfare - the mayor of the town personally showed us around and there were paparazzi documenting our every move for the first week - it was bizarre.

'People now know me as the 'Black Doctor-Footballer.'
