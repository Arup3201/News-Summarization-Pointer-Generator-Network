The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge won a landmark legal case yesterday blocking further publication of topless photographs of Kate.

Judges banned French magazine Closer from selling or republishing the pictures and said its decision to use them had been a ‘brutal’ invasion of the couple’s privacy.

However, the injunction was branded a ‘hollow victory’ because more than 500,000 copies of the magazine have already been sold, about 100,000 more then normal.

Thrilled: The giggling Royal couple will be over the moon as they end their Jubilee tour as their lawyers won a landmark injunction in a Parisian court today

And there were fears that the ruling 
would do little to halt the worldwide spread of the pictures because the
 magazine does not own the copyright.

A freelance photographer based in 
France is understood to have taken the ‘particularly intrusive’ pictures
 and sold them to Closer. He or she is thought to own the copyright.

The French judicial system has so far been unable to discover the name of the photographer.

As a result, no injunction banning 
him from selling the pictures in France or around the world can be put 
in place. This means that although William and Kate have won their 
hearing, they have been unable to ban any future sales.

eBay has removed copies of French Closer containing naked photos of the Duchess of Cambridge.

Upset members have been contacting management demanding they are pulled down.

'Following strong feedback from the eBay community, we will be removing these items, and are already in the process of doing so,' an Ebay spokesman said.

Copies of French Closer magazine featuring topless photos of the Duchess of Cambridge were doing a roaring trade on the UK version of the online auction site.

Some users had been selling the magazine, which is otherwise not available to buy in the UK, since it first hit the shelves last week.

Multiple listings for the magazine were live on the site, with one offering a 'buy it now' price of £35 with the seller 'huni-pie' leaving a note reading: 'Closer magazine in french bought back from Paris today has photos of the royals topless.'

Another copy attracted 12 bids before it sold for £31.01.

Twitter users have also been using the networking site to distribute copies among themselves.

User @kasabianite tweeted four days ago: 'If any of my followers are in France id appreciate it if they’d go to the shop & buy a copy of closer magazine, i’ll dm my address.'

The judges said the magazine’s use of the photos was a ‘brutal exhibition’ of the couple’s intimacy.

Last night a French legal source told
 the Mail: ‘This ruling is all about stopping Closer from publishing 
more pictures. Although it is an important legal step for William and 
Kate, it doesn’t stop more pictures from being published because we 
can’t find the photographer. To some extent it’s a hollow victory.

‘However, a French judge would 
certainly take a dim view of any French paper or magazine which decided 
to print the pictures after this ruling.’

In a written judgment handed down at 
the Tribunal de Grand Instance in Nanterre, a suburb of Paris, judges 
agreed that the couple ‘could legitimately suppose’ the chateau they 
were staying in ‘was sheltered from prying eyes’.

Closer magazine was also ordered to 
hand over all files containing the intimate images to representatives of
 the couple within 24 hours.

Mondadori Magazines France, the 
glossy magazine’s publisher, faces a fine of £8,000 for every day it 
refuses to hand over the pictures.

The company was also ordered to pay 
£1,600 in court costs. Such sums are meagre given the huge success of 
the latest edition of Closer, which features the pictures of a topless 
Kate.

Closer will be fined £80,000 if it 
sells the pictures to another publication, the judgment states. 
Publication of the photos, taken in Provence on September 5, was also 
banned ‘on digital tablets’. Royal lawyers did not ask for any remaining
 copies of the magazine to be removed from newsagents because ‘the 
damage has already been done’.

Last night a royal source said William and Kate were delighted with the decision.

‘They welcome the injunction that’s 
been granted,’ the source said. ‘They always believed the law was broken
 and that they were entitled to their privacy.’

The Duke and Duchess have also filed a
 criminal complaint under France’s privacy laws. If Closer is found 
guilty it could be fined up to £36,000 and its editor could, in theory 
at least, serve up to a year in prison.

However, publications in France often
 flout privacy laws because they know that fines are small and prison 
sentences rarely handed out.

On Monday their lawyer Aurelien 
Hamelle told the court that the photos revealed ‘particularly simple and
 deeply intimate moments in the life of this couple that have no reason 
to be on a magazine cover’. He went on to say that the Duchess is ‘a 
young woman, not an object’.

William and Kate are prepared to devote years to legal battles pursuing those responsible for the topless pictures – or those who publish them.

Sources close to the couple confirmed they were under no illusions  about the length of time it could take for their fight to make its way through the Paris courts.

But they insist that the Duke and Duchess will press ahead because they feel so strongly about the invasion of their privacy.

This morning, the couple’s complaint against French Closer magazine – the first to publish the images – is to be heard at the Tribunal de Grande Instance in the Paris suburb of Nanterre.

They have instructed Paris barrister Aurelien Hammelle to call for ‘the stiffest punishment possible’ against the magazine.

St James’s Palace said there were plans to press for criminal charges against the photographer – who has so far remained unidentified.

The Duke and Duchess are also considering action against the Irish edition of the Daily Star, which printed the pictures on Saturday.
