Â A Philadelphia faith-healing mother charged with murder after a second son died of pneumonia has been granted bail, but her husband must stay in jail.

Catherine and Herbert Schaible, who are both members of the First 
Century Gospel Church, do not believe in modern medicine, but rather divine healing.

They were charged with third-degree murder after their
8-month-old son died and went untreated of the respiratory illness.

Four years ago the couple's two-year-old son also died from untreated pneumonia, leading to a conviction on involuntary manslaughter.

The mother of seven other children, Common Pleas Judge Benjamin Lerner ruled that Schaible be released for the children's welfare, according to The Philadelphia Inquirer.

Since the Schaible's were put in prison this April, the couple's surviving children have been living in foster care.

'These children have one mother and one 
father, and I don't think it's necessarily a good thing that for months,
they have had virtually no contact with either parent,' he said.

The Schaible's were charged with murder 
after their infant son Brandon died of pneumonia, which could have been 
prevented if he was given medical treatment for his illness.

Herbert Schaible, 44, said in a statement to police that was read in court earlier this year that, 'We believe in divine healing, that Jesus shed blood for our healing and that he died on the cross to break the devil's power.' Medicine, he said, 'is against our religious beliefs.'

His 43-year-old wife said in her statement that 'we pray and ask to be healed the way that Jesus did when he was on Earth.

Officials at the Philadelphia Industrial Correctional Center told The Associated Press that Schaible can live in her parents' home under electronic monitoring once her $250,000 bail is posted.

However, Lerner refused to grant bail to Herber, The Inquirer reported.

Defense attorney Mythri Jayaraman argued that Catherine Schaible was less culpable because the couple's church taught that a wife must be 'submissive to her husband.'

Pastor Nelson Clark and Assistant Pastor Ralph Myers of First Century Gospel Church testified that Herbert Schaible made decisions about the welfare of the couple's children.

'She would have a say, but he would make the decision,' Clark said.

Assistant District Attorney Joanne Pescatore argued against treating Catherine Schaible differently from her husband.

'She was that child's mother, and he was that child's father, and they both have equal responsibility for that child,' she said.

Clark said under questioning from the judge that he suggested a day or two before Brandon's death that Herbert Schaible tell his probation officer about the child's illness, but 'he said that if he called anyone, it would be a denial of his faith that God could heal the child.'

Myers testified that Clark asked him to go to the home and help pray over Brandon, and the next day the child's grandmother asked him to return, saying Brandon hadn't moved in two hours. When he arrived, the child was dead, Myers said.
