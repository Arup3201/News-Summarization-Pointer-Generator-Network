Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain forgot about England's team huddle moments before kick-off as Roy Hodgson's side beat Scotland 3-1 at Celtic Park.

As the rest of the England squad came together to rouse themselves for the fixture against the Auld Enemy, Oxlade-Chamberlain appears oblivious as he makes his way to his position ready for the start of the match.

The Arsenal midfielder was caught on camera trotting off as he completed his own final preparations, failing to realise he had left a gaping hole in the huddle.

The 21-year-old's team-mates are seen calling Oxlade-Chamberlain over to listen to captain Wayne Rooney's pre-match pep talk.

He leisurely turns and jogs back towards the huddle and eventually joins his team-mates.

The incident obviously didn't effect the former Southampton player's performance as he gave England a first-half lead with a glancing header and set the Three Lions on the road to victory.
