Real Madrid coach Carlo Ancelotti hailed his 'extraordinary' team after they set a new Spanish record of 19 straight victories with Tuesday's 4-0 triumph over Ludogorets.

The European Cup holders beat the Bulgarians at the Bernabeu to finish their Champions League Group B campaign with a 100 per cent record.

Only five teams had previously managed to win all six group games in the competition.

Real Madrid coach Carlo Ancelotti barks out some instructions during his side's 4-0 win over Ludogorets 

'It is not easy preparing for each game with the same levels of motivation and eagerness that these players are showing', Ancelotti said.

'After losing to Atletico (Madrid on September 13), I couldn't have imagined stringing together 19 consecutive wins.

'I was sure that the things that weren't going well would be fixed, but not to this extent.

'It is a result we have achieved with extraordinary seriousness and an incredible amount of professionalism.

'I know that I have an extraordinary group of players.

'I have a very good relationship with the players. I care a lot for them and I thank them for the work they're doing as much as I can.' 

Tuesday's win allowed Madrid to pass the consecutive wins mark of Frank Rijkaard's Barcelona, a side that won 18 straight games in the 2005-06 campaign.

Gareth Bale leaped above Ludogorets' defence to score his side's second goal of the night 

Ancelotti's squad are five wins away from equalling the world record of 24 straight victories set by Brazilian outfit Coritiba FC in 2011.

'We are enjoying a great moment: the players, the technical staff and the club, which has always supported us,' Ancelotti said. 'We have to keep this run going.'

Madrid are two points above Barcelona in the La Liga standings and play away to Almeria on Friday.
