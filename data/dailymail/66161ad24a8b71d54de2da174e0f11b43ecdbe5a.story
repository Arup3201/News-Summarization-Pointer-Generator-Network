Works by some of the biggest names in modern art went on show today ahead of a sale that is expected to make more than £200 million.

More than 30 works, including a painting by Francis Bacon and an Andy Warhol print, have gone on show at Christie's in London, before they are transported to New York for the sale in May.

Among the stand-out lots is Bacon's Three Studies For A Portrait Of John Edwards which dates from 1984 and is valued at £47 million.

Another of the celebrated works to go under the hammer is Jeff Koon's 'Jim Beam-J.B.Turner Train stainless steel and bourbon', valued at £20million.

Christie's Brett Gorvy said the Bacon work was one of the 'greatest paintings' from artist's late period.

He said: 'Three Studies For A Portrait Of John Edwards, executed in 1984, was the centrepiece of the artist's retrospective at the London Tate Gallery in 1985-86, and a work that the artist himself ranked amongst his best works.'

Last year, another of Bacon's paintings - Three Studies Of Lucian Freud - became the most valuable work of art ever sold at auction when it fetched almost £90 million after just six minutes of frenzied bidding.

American artist Jeff Koons' 1986 work 'Jim Beam J.B. Turner Train' is expected to make around £20million. The train is filled with Jim Beam bourbon

Koons said of the work: 'You can drink it and enjoy the bourbon, but you have killed the work of art because you've destroyed the soul of the piece when you break the tax-stamp seal'

Francis Bacon's 'Three Studies for a Portrait of John Edwards' is expected to make around £48 million. Christie's Brett Gorvy said: 'It shows an incredible tenderness and harmony that was prompted by Bacon's paternal relationship with the sitter, and this period of contentment elicited a confidence of style that has been compared to late Matisse.'

Andy Warhol's 'John Lennon - Red' is one of a number of works by the pop artist going up for sale in New York in May

'Race Riot' by Andy Warhol, which is expected to fetch £30million, uses photos from 1963 unrest in Birmingham, Alabama

The pre-sale show in London also features US artist Jean Michel Basquiat's 1982 work 'Do Not Revenge', expected to fetch around £7.5million

Also going under the hammer in Christie's huge art sale is 'Abstraktes Bild' by Gerhard Richter (left) and 'PH-1033' by Clyfford Still (right), which is valued in the region of £10million

Energy firm E.ON is selling its Jackson Pollock masterpiece 'Number 5 (Elegant Lady)' for around £12million to help fund its art activities for the next 20 years

'Untitled' by Martin Kippenberger, in which the artist portrays himself in a less than flattering light, is valued at around £7.5million

Koons' Jim Beam J. B. Turner Train was made at the height of the 1980s economic boom and formed the centerpiece of one of Koons' most important exhibitions in New York in 1986

Koons was inspired to make it after spotting a similar train, made out of plastic and porcelain, in the window of a Fifth Avenue liquor store
