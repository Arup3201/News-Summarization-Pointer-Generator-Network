Country music star Keith Urban will be coming back to American Idol it was announced on Thursday.

And fans of the hit show are in for another treat as it is heavily rumoured that Jennifer Lopez may join him.

Urban was the only remaining judge from last season on the Fox singing competition show.

The 45-year-old's return was announced by Fox chairman Kevin Reilly who praised the singer's participation last season and said he was a fan favourite.

Meanwhile, 44-year-old Lopez reportedly may return to the judging panel after sitting out last season.

A source toldÂ People the singer is 'very close to signing a deal with Fox to return to American Idol next season.'

'Both Fox and Jennifer are very happy about this and want it to happen very much,' the source added.

The source also denied recent reports that Lopez was turned down by NBC's hit singing competition show The Voice.

American Idol last month said good-bye to three of last season's judges, Mariah Carey, Nicki Minaj and Randy Jackson.

The source said Lopez wanted to return because her world tour has been completed and she has more time for her family and television projects.

J-Lo first joined American Idol in 2011 as part of her attempt to rejuvenate her career.

Reilly declined to comment on who would be joining Urban on the judging panel.

Others in the running to join the panel include American Idol alums Jennifer Hudson and Adam Lambert and Black Eyed Peas member will.i.am.

There were reports on Thursday that Lopez and will.i.am had signed deals, but no confirmation from Fox.

Will.i.am has been a coach for the past two seasons on the U.K. version of The Voice.

Reilly told the television critics the goal was to recruit 'comfortable' judges and refocus on the show's contestants.

The ratings for the one-time juggernaut have sagged in recent years as it contends with competitors such as The Voice.

American Idol will return in January.
