Comedian Larry Wilmore didn't pulling any punches when he launched into a scathing attack on Bill Cosby and the growing number of sexual assault allegations against him in the second episode of his new show.

Wilmore, host of The Nightly Show which has just replaced Stephen Colbert on Comedy Central, began Tuesday's episode by telling viewers that the show would be all about Cosby.

'Tonight we are talking about Cosby,' Wilmore said. 'We're answering the question, did he do it? The answer will be yes.'

'There's a statute of limitations on the charges, but there's no statute of limitations on my opinion, and I'm telling you, that motherf***** did it,' he added.

Wilmore joked about Cosby's ill-advised decision to name his tour Far From Finished and then posed a question about the allegations that has baffled him the most.

'Why aren't people listening to these women?' he asked.

'Is it because most of this allegedly happened so long ago? Is it because some of them went into Cosby's hotel room alone? Is it because there are no Polaroids? Is it because he's so famous? Or is it just because they're women?'

Wilmore said 35 women have since come forward to allege Cosby had sexually assaulted them.

'Really folks, how many do we need?' the 53-year-old late night host asked.

'Let's understand this number. That's like if Bill Cosby drugged and raped every single U.S. president from George Washington to John F. Kennedy!'

The Emmy-winning writer also said he felt it was in 'poor taste' for Cosby to continue with his tour.

'The worst place for him to address these allegations is the stage,' said Wilmore. 

Wilmore then ran a clip of Cosby getting heckled during one of his recent shows in Canada. 

From the stage Cosby can be heard meekly answering back: 'Stop it. Stop it. That's right…shh…shh. No clapping, nothing. That's all right.'

'Are you trying to quiet a heckler or is that your pillow talk?' joked Wilmore.

Nightly Show contributor Mike Yard then joined in. 

'I've been doing comedy for 20 years. I've seen a lot of alleged criminals on stage. That doesn't mean your act has to be sloppy,' said Yard. 

'If you can't handle a Canadian heckler, it's time to get out of the game.'

Wilmore also took a moment during the show to reflect on the possibility that the allegations against the entertainer could be false.

'Let's consider for a second that Cosby didn't do it,' he said. 'OK, we're done.'
