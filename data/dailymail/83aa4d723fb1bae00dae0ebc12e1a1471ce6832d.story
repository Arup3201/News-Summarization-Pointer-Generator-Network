Britain will experience the first real taste of winter this week when freezing winds bring snow to much of the country.

Some of the coldest weather of the year is expected by Tuesday, with bitter blasts from the Arctic causing widespread frosts and plunging temperatures.

Wednesday night is expected to be the coldest since last winter.

By then, most parts of the country will have seen wintry showers and some high ground in the north will be shivering in temperatures as low as minus-three, with significant snowfalls.

According to the Met Office,  even cities such as Manchester and Leeds will experience temperatures as low as minus-two.

The meteorologists are also predicting light snow in parts of the South-West by Tuesday afternoon, and sleet over the Pennines on Wednesday afternoon.

Supermarkets are anticipating a surge in sales of snow shovels and de-icers – and traditional winter warmers such as soup and hot chocolate.

Met Office forecaster Charles Powell said: ‘Over  the past few weeks we’ve experienced some warm weather, so by Tuesday most people will realise that temperatures have dropped significantly. ‘I would say they will feel the first winter weather on Tuesday.’

However, there is some good news – the forecasters also say temperatures should improve again by next weekend.
