Senator-elect Ricky Muir fumbled his way through a rare media interview on Sunday, struggling to answer questions about his political party's main topic of interest.

The Australian Motoring Enthusiast Party senator, who is set to become one of the most powerful players in Australian politics in less than a month, got flustered while talking about the automobile industry with Channel Seven's Sunday Night.

The 34-year-old will be part of a balance-of-power bloc along with the Palmer United Party (PUP) when he begins his six-year term in July.

On Sunday, veteran Seven reporter Mike Willesee asked Mr Muir to explain what he meant by the 'aftermarket' automobile industry, but the Victorian stumbled with his answer before taking a break.

'There's the aftermarket industry which can be supported ... people that are losing their jobs ... sorry ... can we start that question again?' Mr Muir said.

'There's the aftermarket industry ... which ... um ... sorry, can we go to another question? I've got myself into a fluster.

'The aftermarket industry is the industry that is ... can I go out for a minute?'

After a short break, Mr Muir returns, and Mr Willesee advises him to answer questions as if he's talking to someone at a pub.

Mr Muir, who has maintained his job at a timber mill ahead of the move to Canberra, also struggles to explain what it means to hold the balance of power in the Senate.

Mike Willesee: Do you understand what balance of power means?Ricky Muir: Yes. It's the potential if... Ah, let's say in this case Labor and the Greens, um. It's the power to vote down legislation in the right circumstances.Correct answer: A balance of power (in reference to the Senate) is a position held by a minor party, independent or coalition which means their vote is necessary for legislation to be passed.

MW: I don't know what you mean by [aftermarket industry]?RM: The aftermarket industry is the industry, um, that is... [To himself] Take a breath. Can I go out for a minute?Correct answer: The aftermarket automotive industry deals with car parts that are sold to consumers other than vehicle manufacturers (such as Ford or Holden). Aftermarket manufacturers make motor vehicle parts - such as tyres, seats, engines, batteries or brake pads - and sell to car repair shops or directly to consumers. The products are used to replace faulty parts, to modify cars or to maintain the performance of vehicles.

'Yes, it's the potential if, aah, say in this case Labor and the Greens, umm, it's the power to vote down legislation in the right circumstances,' he said.

Mr Muir is usually camera shy but he made headlines shortly after he was elected in September last when a video surfaced on his YouTube account allegedly showing him taking part in a backyard kangaroo poo fight. The video has since been removed.

PUP leader and businessman Clive Palmer on Monday attacked the Sunday Night program's story as 'biased and churlish'.

'Mike Willesee recorded about an hour of a really serious interview with me about political things and other things but he didn't show any of that,' he told ABC radio.

'He doesn't show you all of the footage. Just selective pieces.'

Mr Palmer described Mr Muir as an 'ordinary' Australian.

'He's there because people think he's more in contact with the real world,' the Queensland lower house MP said.

The interview with Mr Muir was part of a broader story on the PUP with which Mr Muir, a father-of-five from the Gippsland town of Heyfield, will join forces from next month when the Senate changes over.

Jacqui Lambie, a former soldier and the PUP's Tasmanian senator-elect, doesn't hesitate when asked about her favourite weapon.

'Definitely M60 (submachine gun). Its massive firepower. Yeah, when you've got it in your hands,' she said.

WA senator-elect Dio Wang said he would vote with his heart even if that means crossing Mr Palmer.

Asked if he had stood up to Mr Palmer in the past, Mr Wang replied: 'Not yet, because he has been always right so far.

'He is already a great leader.'

Come July 1, there will be three PUP senators, including Glenn 'The Brick with Eyes' Lazarus.

Mr Muir was elected after securing 0.01 per cent of the primary vote.

Mr Palmer is threatening to use his Senate team to block some of the federal coalition government's budget measures.

Mr Muir, who will hold the balance of power in the Senate, also struggled to explain what that means
