Luxembourg's little Princess Amalia has been baptised in a French chapel surrounded by members of the grand duchy's royal family.

Her parents, Prince Felix and Princess Claire, smiled as they walked from the venue in the south east town of Saint-Ferréol-de Lorgues, cradling the newborn in their arms. 

But the star of the ceremony seemed a little less interested - spending most of the time asleep.

New arrival: The pair were all smiles as they left the  chapel - but their daughter was sound asleep 

Comfortable: Princess Claire tentatively strokes the hair of their daughter who was born last month

Alongside the proud parents at the intimate ceremony was Grand Duke Henri, the monarchical head of state, and his wife Grand Duchess Maria Teresa, as well as Hartmut and Gabriele Lademacher, the mother and father of the bride.

Grand Duke Jean and Crown Prince Guillaume (the first in line to the throne) also posed for pictures as Prince Felix and his wife cradled the newborn in their arms.

Amalia was born on Sunday, June 15 in the maternity ward of the Grande-Duchesse Charlotte hospital and carries the full name of Amalia Gabriela Maria Teresa.

The baptism was performed by the Rev. Yves Menjot. The couple chose Felix's younger sister Princess Alexandra, 23, to be a godmother and Claire's older brother, also named Felix to be a godfather.

Princess Amalia, her parents' first child, joins a busy royal nursery that already contains Prince Gabriel of Nassau and Prince Noah of Nassau.

They are the two sons of Prince Felix's younger brother, Prince Louis, 27, and his 28-year-old wife Princess Tessy.

The royal brood of Luxemburg looks likely to grow: Prince Guillaume has been married to Belgian countess Stéphanie de Lannoy since 2012, while Grand Duke Henri and Grand Duchess Maria Teresa have two further children.

Arrival: The royal pair arrive at the chapel. Prince Felix has the newborn cradled in his arms
