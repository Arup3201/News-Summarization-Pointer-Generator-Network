Lying on a stretcher in a neck brace, this is the moment a rapper was taken to hospital after jumping into the audience from a 35ft light rigging and breaking a female fan's arm during a late-night concert.

American musician, George Watsky, and two others were left in need of medical treatment after the show at Alexandra Palace, London, during which Watsky jumped from the gantry in a 'huge overreach in the heat of the moment'.

The woman suffered a 
broken arm and a male victim was left with back injuries while 27-year-old Watsky 
was covered in bruising following the incident for which the rapper has apologised.

Rapper George Watsky is taken to hospital on a stretcher after jumping 35ft from a light rigging at a concert at Alexandra Palace in London

Watski, from San Francisco, California, was left covered in bruising while the other victims suffered a broken arm and back injuries

Witnesses recall how Watsky from San 
Francisco, California, scaled the lighting fixture during his last song 
before asking spectators: 'Have you got my back?'.

He then jumped off the rigging and fell the equivalent of three storeys into the crowd.

However, his terrified fans scattered
and the musician and poet landed on a man and a woman, who collapsed on
the concrete floor.

All three had to be stretchered out 
and taken to hospital and organisers were forced to temporarily stop the
Vans Warped punk rock tour concert.

Watsky has since apologised
on Facebook for his 'shameful' actions and has visited the female fan 
in hospital to personally say sorry.

'Shameful': The 27-year-old rapper scaled the lighting rig during his last song before asking spectators 'have you got my back?'

Stunned Alex McCabe, 24, of Plymouth, Devon, captured the terrifying leap on video.

He said: 'Watsky was obviously so pumped the crowd was loving him. At the start of the song he asked us if we had his back no matter what he did. Everyone shouted 'yes'.

'At the end he climbed the rigging, and as no one stopped him we thought it was scripted. He stood at the top and jumped.

'The crowd parted and he hit the concrete taking a couple of people with him.'

Reveller Robert Moody was one of the estimated 7,000 audience members when Watsky jumped at around 3.30pm on Sunday.

Robert, a freelance music writer from Nottingham, said: 'When the band started playing the last song, he climbed up a rope ladder at the side of the stage.

'It was surreal - everyone was just waving their hands, thinking he was just going to perform the last chorus from the lights. But without warning he just jumped off.

'The band were still playing, but the collective gasp from the audience was louder than they were.

'It was just one of those surreal moments - he jumped from so high, it seemed like it was about three storeys.

'After they finished the song, the whole show stopped as paramedics rushed in and stretchered him out. It's a miracle nobody was killed.'

Watsky, who has appeared on cult American daytime TV show Ellen, posted a humble apology on his Facebook page.

He revealed he suffered 'some nicks, bruises and the shame of endangering the crowd'.

He wrote: 'I have no excuse for my actions, and the only way I can explain my mindset is that it was a huge overreach in the heat of the moment. No, I was not drunk or on drugs.

'I used to be a kid who was afraid to do anything physically dangerous - I was scared of the ball in little league, didn't want to jump into lakes and would never have had the nerve to crowdsurf.

'But in the last year of touring, I've done increasingly risky things, maybe pushing myself by some dumb sense I am conquering my early timidity.

'I pride myself on trying to put on a good show and always giving 100 per cent energy, but jumping off some high s*** doesn't make someone a good musician or performer.'

He added: 'I feel f****** terrible. I made a boneheaded decision that got people hurt, and it's extremely lucky it wasn't worse.

'Putting your own body on the line is one thing, but putting other people in harm's way is inexcusable.

'I let down my supporters, I let down the Warped Tour and I let down my band and the people who work their asses off behind the scenes to make these shows happen.

'My Â£1 priority right now is to somehow make this right for the folks who were hurt.'

Watsky is scheduled to perform at the Nouveau Casino in Paris tomorrow.

Last month, he posted a series of pictures on his Facebook showing him jump off a first floor balcony into a crowd while wearing a green Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtle costume.

The Vans Warped Tour is an annual travelling music event, which saw over 50 artists perform on several stages over two days at the London venue.

The final two dates of the Warped Tour this year are in Switzerland and Austria, next weekend.

Watsky is set to perform every night this week, including one show in Paris and three in Germany.
