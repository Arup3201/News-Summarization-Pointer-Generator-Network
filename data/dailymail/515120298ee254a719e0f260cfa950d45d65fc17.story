Disgraced England hooker Josh Hodgson could face the exit door after smashing through one during a drunken night out. 

YouTube footage showed Hodgson, who will play in the NRL next season with the Canberra Raiders, demolishing the door with a shoulder charge during a party at a Dunedin student flat.

The incident occurred after his side’s 16-14 loss to New Zealand in the Four Nations on Saturday at Forsyth Barr Stadium. Hodgson may have proved adept at making new friends by breaking down barriers, but he will now be disciplined by England for the incident.

As well as breaking through the door, Hodgson, 25, had earlier broken into the England team, winning his first two caps against Samoa and Australia in the competition. However, he had been dropped for England’s final match against New Zealand and replaced by Catalans’ Elliott Whitehead.

The short YouTube clip shows the former Hull KR forward crashing through a door inside the flat to chants of “go through the door” from party-goers.

A student in the flat, who did not wish to be named, told Fairfax Media that most of the squad had come to the address near the hotel where the English team was staying for a party on Saturday night.

She said 'definitely like 15-20 people' arrived around 4.30am on Sunday morning and didn't leave until 8.30am.

England management replaced the door and team manager Jon Roberts apologised in a statement.

'We were made aware of an incident that occurred last night around lunchtime today,' he said. 'It is being dealt with internally with the person involved, and they will be disciplined.'

Hodgson may also be in more hot water when he joins up with his new NRL side, Canberra Raiders, later this month. 

He has signed a two-year contract with the NRL side and the Raiders released a statement saying they had 'been made aware of the incident'.

Raiders chief executive Don Furner said he had been in communication with Hodgson. 

'Josh has said that he is embarrassed by what he has done and he will be spoken to further when he arrives at club headquarters because that sort of behaviour is unacceptable at the Raiders,' Furner said.

England players had been given permission to go out on the town after their 14-16 loss to the Kiwis on Saturday night.

'On behalf of England Rugby League, we apologise for the behaviour and have arranged for the repair of the small amount of damage,' Roberts said.

'We have had a great time in Dunedin and the city has made us welcome. Last night's match was a great spectacle for International Rugby League and we look forward to returning to the city in the future.​'

Hodgson was encouraged on with chants of 'go through the door' by partygoers

Team media manager Danny Reuben said the team had not been drinking in Dunedin during the week, referring to a Fairfax Media story about the team being shocked by the high level of student drinking in the city.
