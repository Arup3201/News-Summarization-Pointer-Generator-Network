A pensioner was found 'brutally' murdered in her own home after a suspected burglary.

The body of widow Una Crown, 86, who lived alone and had no children, was discovered in her bungalow in Magazine Lane, Wisbech, Cambridgeshire, shortly after 11am on Sunday.

Detectives initially treated the death as unexplained but a post-mortem examination last night confirmed she died as a result of an assault.

Brutal: The body of Una Crown, 86, was found in her bungalow in Magazine Lane, Wisbech, Cambridgeshire, shortly after 11am on Sunday after what police described as a 'brutal assault'

Detective Chief Inspector Jon Hutchinson said: 'Mrs Crown died as a result of a brutal assault in her own home.

Mrs Crown was last seen by family members at 11am on Friday and made a phone call to a friend at 6pm on Saturday night and officers believe she was killed at some point overnight.

Detective Hutchinson said the case was not being linked to any other crimes in the area.

But he said one possibility is that Mrs Crown had been killed after a suspect broke into the house.

He said there was no evidence of a 
sexual assault and the property had not been ransacked, adding: 
'Searches and checks are being carried out to establish whether entry 
was forced.

Unlinked: Police said that Mrs Crown's death, which was initially treated as unexplained, is not linked to any other crimes in the area

'It is too early to say what the motive was. This is a close knit community and we are talking to her family and neighbours.

'Our investigation is still at a very early stage and we are trying to build up a picture of the events that led to her death.

'Her murder has obviously devastated her family and I would urge anyone with any information to call police.'

Mrs Crown’s husband, Jack Roland Crown, is understood to have died on Boxing Day 2009, having been married for 60 years.

Neighbours at Mrs Crowns bungalow yesterday described her as a 'perfect neighbour' with 'a heart of gold'.

One neighbour, who asked not to be named, said: 'We’re so shocked that something like this could happen. She was so vulnerable. How could anyone do this?'

She added that Una was 'lonely' following the death of her husband a few years ago.

Neighbour Maureen Lawrence said: 'I can’t remember exactly when I last saw her but she had seemed normal and without any worries.

'When I heard she had died I presumed, because of her age, she had died peacefully but now we are hearing differently, which is very upsetting.

'I’m not aware of there being any problems with crime in the area and we hadn’t noticed anything suspicious.

'This is generally a very quiet street and a nice place to live.'
