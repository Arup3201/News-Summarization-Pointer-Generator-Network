Obese people are at greater risk of developing a serious lung disease, scientists have today warned.

Researchers found excessive fat around the waist and low levels of physical activity are linked to the progression of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD).

A team of experts in Germany and the U.S. looked at the relationship between waist and hip circumference, body mass index (BMI) and exercise levels to COPD cases.

They assessed the link in more than 113,000 men and women in the U.S. aged between 50 and 70, who did not have COPD, cancer or heart diseaseÂ  at the beginning of the study in 1995.

A new study conducted by scientists in Germany and the U.S. has found the larger a person's waistline, the more likely they are to develop a serious lung disease

During the 10-year study, COPD developed in 3,648 of those taking part.

People with larger waists - measuring 110cm or 43.3ins or more in women and 118cm or 46.4ins or more in men - had a 72 per cent increased risk of COPD.

Study co-author Dr Gundula Behrens of Regensburg University in Germany, said: 'We observed a stronger positive relation with abdominal body fat than with total body fat and COPD.

'In particular, overweight as measured by BMI emerged as a significant predictor of increased risk of COPD only among those with a large waist circumference.'

Dr Behrens said a large waist was a robust predictor of COPD in smokers as well as in people who had never smoked.

Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is the name for the collection of lung diseases including chronic bronchitis, emphysema and chronic obstructive airways disease.

People with COPD have difficulties breathing, primarily due to the narrowing of their airways.

Typical symptoms of COPD include increasing breathlessness when a person is active, a persistent cough with phlegm and frequent chest infections.

The main cause of COPD is smoking, the longer you smoke the more likely you are to develop the disease.

This is because smoking irritates the lungs, which results in scarring.

Over many years the inflammation leads to permanent changes in the lung, thickening the airways, producing more mucus.

COPD is one of the most common respiratory diseases in the UK.

It usually affects people over the age of 35, although most cases are not diagnosed until a person is in their 50s.

There are thought to be three million people living with the disease in the UK.

Pollution, smoking and toxic 
particles in workplace dust are thought to cause COPD through chronic 
inflammation and impaired ability to heal injury to the lungs.

Dr
 Behrens said: 'Increased local, abdominal and overall fat depots 
increase local and systemic inflammation, thus potentially stimulating 
COPD-related processes in the lung.'

People
 with a large hip circumference and who were physically active at least 
five times a week were 29 per cent less likely to experience COPD.

Exercise can reduce inflammation, oxidative stress and enhance healing.

The findings, published in the Canadian Medical Association Journal, also showed that underweight people had a 56 per cent increased risk of COPD.

Dr Behrens said possible reasons include malnutrition and reduced muscle mass leading to increased COPD susceptibility and progression through inflammatory processes and impaired lung repair capacity.

Dr Behrens added: 'Our findings suggest that next to smoking cessation and the prevention of smoking initiation, meeting guidelines for body weight, body shape and physical activity level may represent important individual and public health opportunities to decrease the risk of COPD.

'Physicians should encourage their patients to adhere to these guidelines as a means of preventing chronic diseases in general and possibly COPD in particular.'
