As a singer, actress, dancer and TV presenter, Denise Van Outen can turn her hand to many a task.

But these pictures show the star enjoying her most cherished role of all; that of mother to her adorable three-year-old Betsy.

Denise looked incredible in a blue and white bikini as she splashed in the surf with her daughter on a sunshine break in Majorca.

The presenter, who took part in the most recent series of Strictly Come Dancing, showed off a trim frame and a glowing tan.

Her blonde hair was loose and Denise wore a beaming smile as she played with Betsy - her daughter with husband Lee Mead - in the shallow water.

Betsy looked cute as a button in her bright red swimming costume, with her curls tied up in a ponytail.

Just the two of us: Denise was not joined by husband Lee Mead but her little girl

Rumours: The pictures come as Denise and Lee have both denied their marriage is on the rocks

Not a care in the world: The TV star looked in very high spirits as she spent quality time with her daughter

Tanned and toned: Denise revealed a very impressive figure as she took to the sand in her bikini

Denise shared the endearing holiday snaps - including one of her laughing in delight as Betsy playfully flings some sand towards her - on her Twitter page.

Another shot showed the star smiling down at the three-year-old as she held her tight in the waters of the Mediterranean.

The doting mother was also seen holding on to her little girl's bucket and spades while they made their way along the shore.

Messing about: The star and her daughter couldn't stop laughing as they relaxed on the sand

Matching: As Betsy sat on her mother's knees she mimicked her facial expression

Relaxed: Denise certainly looked like she was enjoying herself under the sun

And after a while the mother and daughter take a seat in the sand and start building castles together, giggling throughout.

The sight of the girls enjoying quality time together as a twosome is becoming increasingly familiar amid rumours over the state of Denise's marriage to West End star Lee Mead - although the pair have insisted that all is well with their relationship.

The couple put on a show of unity at the launch of 31-year-old Lee's new show The West End Men earlier this month.

Keeping her entertained: Denise looked intent on ensuring her little girl had a great holiday

Building things: The pair sat on the sand and began building a castle

Earlier this year Denise was spotted holidaying on her own but insisted this was just because they did not employ a nanny so were forced to do things separately.Â 

Speaking to Daybreak at the time she said: 'There's always speculation. Just to set the record straight, we don't have a nanny, so we split our parenting duties, so we do spend time apart.

'If we had a nanny and we went away all the time together then people would critcise us for not taking our child with us. Betsy's in nursery, do you know what I mean?'

Fling: Denise laughed as Betsy chucked sand on her washboard stomach

Mummy dearest: Betsy looked so happy to be spending quality time with her mother

Red, blue and white: The mother and daughter looked chic in their complimentary swimwear combos

The pictures of mother and daughter emerged after Denise enjoyed a visit to No 10 Downing Street earlier this month at the invitation of the Prime Minister's wife Samantha Cameron.

Proud Denise tweeted a picture of her invitation to her followers, joking: 'The first invitation I've had in a while that doesn't say "bring a bottle"!'

She was later photographed arriving at 
the event in a bold orange dress accessorised with silver strappy 
sandals, a matching clutch and a deep tan.

Daybreak presenter Kate Garraway, Nell McAndrew, and newsreader Helen Fospero were among the other guests at the reception to support children's hospice Julia's House.
