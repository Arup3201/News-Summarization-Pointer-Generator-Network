Jose Mourinho says he will not waste his time trying to persuade Petr Cech to change his mind if he wants to leave Chelsea - but says it will take 'huge money' for another club to buy the goalkeeper.

Cech started and kept a clean sheet in Sunday's Capital One Cup final against Tottenham but he has been second choice behind Thibaut Courtois for much of the season.

His situation has drawn interest from a number of top clubs and many expect Cech to end his 11-year association with Chelsea in the summer.

It will require a 'huge' transfer fee to prise Petr Cech from Chelsea in the summer window, says Jose Mourinho

Mourinho said in his press conference that he hopes Cech stays at Stamford Bridge beyond this season

And Mourinho says he will not try to influence the keeper's decision if he does want to leave. 

'I don't think Petr is a guy to be persuaded,' Mourinho said. 'He doesn't let anyone persuade him.

'I think he's very mature making what he feels is the best decision for him and his future. I will just wait, wishing his decision is to stay. That's my desire. I would like him very, very much to stay.

'But I don't waste my time trying to persuade him because it's just his decision. If he tells me he wants to leave I will tell him my opinion, that he is one of the three best goalkeepers in the world, so huge money.'

Mourinho said he would not waste his time trying to persuade Cech as he 'doesn't let anyone persuade him'
