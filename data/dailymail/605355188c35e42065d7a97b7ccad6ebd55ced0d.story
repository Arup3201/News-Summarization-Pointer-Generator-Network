Aleksandar Kolarov believes there has been a power shift in Manchester, and he insists the current Premier League champions have been better than United for the last five or six years. 

City have won six of the last nine derbies between the two Manchester rivals, though the Red Devils have finished above their neighbors in four out of the last six seasons and since the start of 2009 United have eight derby wins to City's seven.

But speaking before Sunday's showdown at the Etihad, Kolarov was quoted as saying on ESPN:  'It is a great game to watch or play in.

'Every player in the world would like to play [in] this game. United has a great history but in the last five or six years, I think we have been superior to them.'

The Etihad side have certainly enjoyed the better of the derbies over the last couple of seasons, and have won the last three Premier League clashes between the two, including last season's 4-1 home success and a 3-0 win at Old Trafford.

Despite this and Kolarov's confidence, the Serbian defender is not taking Louis van Gaal's side lightly, and he added: 'They have changed the manager and bought a lot of great players and I think they can have a good season in the Premier League.

'Van Gaal has a lot of experience. They have bought some great players so it is up to them to do their best.'

Reflecting on his own performances so far this season, Kolarov bemoaned Manuel Pellegrini's rotation policy that has seen him start only seven of City's 14 games as he battles it out with Gael Clichy to be the club's first-choice left back.

The 28-year-old said: 'On a personal level, I don't like the rotation [policy] but it is the manager's choice and I give 100 per cent when I am playing.'
