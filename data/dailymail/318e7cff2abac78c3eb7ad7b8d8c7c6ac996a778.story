QPR boss Harry Redknapp has launched an attack on directors of football, insisting that he could never work alongside one at Loftus Road.

The former Tottenham boss ripped into the system used by Spurs, who sit 12th in the Premier League following a huge but generally unsuccessful recruitment drive in the summer of 2013.

Under the guidance of technical director Franco Baldini, the north London outfit spent the money earned from Gareth Bale's world record move to Real Madrid on seven players at a cost of £107million.

Andre Villas-Boas was sacked by chairman Daniel Levy just a few months later, with summer acquisitions including Paulinho, Roberto Soldado and Erik Lamela failing to live up to their hefty price-tags.

Redknapp, who has complete control of purchases at QPR, cannot see the sense in managers being forced to work with players that they have not chosen themselves.

In an interview with the Evening Standard, Redknapp said: 'It totally undermines your role as manager if you're not picking the players. It's a joke really that you are expected to work with someone else's players. It's all very well someone recommending players to you but when they don't work out, it's your head on the block.'

The 67-year-old made his feelings about working under a director of football clear to Tottenham when he moved to White Hart Lane in 2008, resulting in Damien Comolli being sacked.

And Redknapp insists that it is not fair that managers are judged - and possibly sacked - because of decisions not made by them.

He added: 'I'm just not in favour of that. As a manager I have to select the players, train them every day and make decisions. To expect me to work with players someone else has decided I want is a nonsense. I want to make my own decisions and rightfully so. If things don't work out fine, I'm responsible for that. But why should I be accountable for someone else's mistakes?

'My head's on the block when it goes wrong so no I'm not going to support something that could cost me my job and I have no say in it.'
