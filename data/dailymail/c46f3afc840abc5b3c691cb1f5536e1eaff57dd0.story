A teenager from West Africa who became sick while visiting Florida on holiday caused Jackson Memorial Hospital to go on high alert on Sunday amid fears that he may have the deadly Ebola virus.

Officials said the patient took a taxi to Mount Sinai Medical Center in Miami Beach after he became sick with flu-like symptoms. Miami Beach Fire Rescue then transferred him to Jackson for further tests.

A test performed by the Department of Health came back negative on Monday morning, but Miami Beach Mayor Philip Levine said the results were being sent to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention for a final test.

A hazardous materials team was called to Jackson Memorial Hospital, Florida, on Sunday amid fears that a teenager traveling from West Africa may have the deadly Ebola virus

'Thank God it was negative,' Levine told WSVN. 'If there were to be anything above and beyond a general sickness, we need to be able to protect our residents and our tourists, and all the teams worked well together.'

Authorities were taking no chances on Sunday and called in the hazardous materials team.

Several police cars and rescue vehicles ringed Holtz Children’s Hospital at Jackson and the unit was quarantined for two hours following the teenager's transfer, reports the Miami Herald.

‘It’s important to point out that this patient did not meet the Centers for Disease Control case definition for Ebola, but the test is being conducted out of an abundance of caution, and health officials expect the test to rule out Ebola,’ said Florida Gov. Rick Scott on Sunday night. 

Miami Beach Mayor Philip Levine tweeted on Monday that the boy's test results have now been sent to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention for a final test for Ebola

It's almost a week since Liberian Thomas Duncan became the first person in the U.S. to be diagnosed with Ebola

'Florida still does not have any confirmed cases of Ebola, and we hope we never do, but we are taking every preparedness step possible to keep our citizens and our visitors safe.’

A firm diagnosis can take 48 hours, experts say. 

Authorities haven’t disclosed the patient’s name or said which West African country he and his family were from.

Jackson spokesman Edwin O’Dell had said the hospital was prepared to handle the case if it turned out to be Ebola.

'Jackson has been publicly forthcoming in asserting our confidence and readiness, and that we have established and tested protocols to deal with infectious diseases in general and with Ebola in specific,' he said.

'We will do everything to ensure safety and treatment for all of our patients.'

It is almost a week since Thomas Duncan, who had traveled to Dallas from Liberia, became the first person in the United States to be diagnosed with the disease. 

The Florida Department of Health has requested 30 additional Ebola testing kits from the CDC to ensure that all of Florida’s public hospitals 'have the ability to test patients who county health officials and the CDC believe need to be tested for Ebola,' said Scott.

The Health Department also requested '100 units of additional high-level personal protective equipment to ensure the state is ready to backfill any county whose medical personnel develop a future need for these supplies.'
