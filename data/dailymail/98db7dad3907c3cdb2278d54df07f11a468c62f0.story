Goalkeeper Fraser Forster is poised to step straight into the Southampton team to face Liverpool at Anfield on Sunday after completing his £10m move from Celtic.

The England international, 26, was signed after Southampton lost 1-0 at home to Bayer Leverkusen on Saturday in their final close-season friendly and Saints manager Ronald Koeman said: ‘He will have the best years of his career at Southampton.’

Artur Boruc is likely to lose out with the signing of Forster. Boruc was beaten by an own goal from Saints’ new Italian striker Graziano Pelle, who was signed from Feyenoord.

Forster, who has been handed a four year contract, has been one of Southampton manager Ronald Koeman’s primary transfer targets this summer as he attempts to rebuild his squad after a raft of departures from the south coast club.

Forster earned a place in England’s World Cup squad after impressing Roy Hodgson with a string of superb performances in the Champions League for Celtic.

Capped twice by his country, Forster was the only player not to feature as England failed to progress beyond the group stage in Brazil.

In February this year Forster set a new Scottish league record for consecutive shut-outs, passing former Aberdeen goalkeeper Bobby Clark’s achievement from 1971, by going 13 matches and 1,256 minutes without losing a goal.

Celtic signed the 6ft 7in keeper on a four-year deal from Newcastle for £2m in 2012, following two seasons on loan in Glasgow, and it is understood his former club will be due a percentage of any sell-on fee.
