Louis van Gaal insist that Manchester United will be his last job in football – but admits that he could go on and on if he gets it right at Old Trafford.

Despite the difficulties of the season, the Manchester United manager is enjoying life in the Premier League and is even thinking about what he should say when United’s owners, the Glazer family, offer him a new deal.

Van Gaal has revealed the United job will be his last but he could extend his contract at Old Trafford

Van Gaal, who signed a three-year deal with United last summer, said: ‘I can confirm this will be my last job but there could be five years to go yet. I can extend my contract. You never know.

‘You always have to be in the moment and then you can decide. I’m in a situation where I signed for three years because you can build something up in that time and the club agreed with that. I don’t know how I would react in the circumstances when Manchester United ask me to extend and if I should do that. But this is my last club.’

And the United manager has also confirmed that he talked to Liverpool about becoming Director of Football three years ago – but says that he has ended up at England’s top club.

Van Gaal was interviewed for the job by Liverpool in 2012, shortly before he became manager the Netherlands and Sunday's opposing manager Brendan Rodgers took over at Anfield.

Asked if he had spoken to Liverpool, van Gaal said: ‘Yes. But that is not so interesting anymore. I have spoken to a lot of clubs. It’s not so interesting, it’s in the past. It’s not good for Liverpool, Tottenham or for me to reopen things that are in the past.

‘It’s in the past and we are now in the present. I’m the manager of Manchester United, the No.1 club in England but Liverpool also has a very good record in history. But I’m the coach of United, I can only speak about Liverpool as an opponent, but not as a club of mine.’
