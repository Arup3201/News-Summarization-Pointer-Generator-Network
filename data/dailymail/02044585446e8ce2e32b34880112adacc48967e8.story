Levi Aron, the 'Butcher of Brooklyn', plead guilty today after admitting to the murder of eight-year-old Leiby Kletzky, who was abducted last July as he walked home from day camp alone for the first time.

The boy had to walk just seven blocks to get to where his parents were eagerly waiting for him, when he got lost and stopped to ask Aron for directions.

In a gruesome confession, Aron told the courts that he smothered, dismembered and stuffed Leiby into a suitcase after snatching him from a Brooklyn street on July 11, 2011, in shockingly detached detail.

Plea: Levi Aron arrives in New York state Supreme Court to plead guilty to murder

Under the deal, Aron would entered a guilty plea to murder, receiving up to life in prison, plus another 15 years for kidnapping.

Judge Neil Firetog asked Aron a series of questions during the court appearance. He admitted to kidnapping the boy, taking him to a wedding in Rockland County and then killing him.

Just two days after Leiby went missing last year, Aron penned a confessional that detailed his horrific crime.

'He fought back a little bit until [sic] eventually he stopped breathing,' Aron wrote.

'I carried the body to the front room to start by placing him on the red mattress where I cut one leg at the hip.'

Today he told the court again that he tied Leiby up with a towel when they returned from the wedding.

'What did you do with that towel?' asked the judge.

'Smothered him,' he whispered.

Then, the judge asked him what he did next.

'I got rid of the body,' Aron said, according to the New York Post.

'How did you get rid of the body,' the judge asked.

'I put it in a suitcase.'

'In order to put the body in a suitcase, did you have to cut up the body?'

'Yes,' Aron replied.

'Did you get a knife?'

'Yes.'

'From where?' the judge asked.

'The kitchen.'

'What did u do with the suitcase?'

'I took it to a dumpster.'

Nachman and Esther Kletzky did not attend the hearing, but did issue a statement.

'There is no way one can comprehend or understand the pain of losing a child,' Nachman Kletzky said.

'Esther and I faced this unspeakable tragedy last year when out little boy Leiby was ruthlessly taken from us.'

'Today my family has finally received some partial closure on one aspect of this nightmare. Closure does not mean we don't continue to feel the pain.'

He continued: 'A day does not pass without our thinking of Leiby -- but today we close the door on this one aspect of our tragedy and seek to remember only the gifts that God has bestowed, including the nine years Leiby was with us.'

Confession: Levi Aron penned this horrific confession after his arrest last year

Assemblyman Dov Hikind, who has been speaking on behalf of the Kletzky family, told the New York Daily News that the family did not want to go through with a trial.

'The family has to live with this for the rest of their lives. They want to bring this to a conclusion,' he said.

'The idea of having a trial was not something that they wanted to go through. They want to make sure that there is justice.'

There was no comment from Aron's defense lawyers on the plea deal. 

Last
 July, Leiby got lost on his walk home from day 
camp and asked Aron, whom he met on the street, for help.

It was the first time the child had been allowed to walk home alone.

He was supposed to walk just seven blocks to
 meet his mother but missed a turn.

Aron,
 a hardware supply store clerk, took the boy home where they watched TV before the boy fell asleep, police said.

Leiby
 remained there the next day when Aron went to work - and a frantic 
search was taking place in the community for the lost boy. 

'Towards the end of the day when I saw the flyers, I panicked and was affraid [sic],' he wrote in his confession on July 13, 2011.

He made the boy a tuna sandwich before smothering him with a towel.

'He fought back a little bit until [sic] eventually he stopped breathing,' Aron wrote.

Not knowing what to do with the body, Aron began cutting into the boy's skin.

'I carried the body to the front room to start by placing him on the red mattress where I cut one leg at the hip,' he wrote.

'I understand this maybe [sic] wrong and I'm sorry for hurt that I've caused.'

Referring then on to the boy's limbs as 'parts' he stuffed them in the refrigerator and took two showers.

'I panicked and looked for something to transport the parts. Then putting the parts in a suitcase. Then carrying suitcase to the car. Then left,' he wrote.

He put the suitcase in a dumpster just two miles from his home.

Officials found Leiby's severed feet still wrapped in plastic in his freezer.

Afterwards he told officers that he was hearing voices telling him ‘to take his own life for 
what he did.'

Aron,
 who has grown massively obese while on Riker's Island, was allegedly 
suffering from psychotic episodes and placed on suicide watch.

My name is Levi Aron.

Jailed for life: Levi Aron, 36, accepted a plea deal for the kidnap, murder and dismemberment of Leiby Kletzky last July in Brooklyn, New York

On Monday evening around 5:30P I went to my dentist Dr Sorcher to make a payment for visit for exam routine.

A boy approached me on where the Judaica book store was, he was still there when went out from the dentist's office.

He asked me for a ride to the Judaica book store.

While on the way, he changed his mind and wasn't sure where he wanted to go.

So I asked if he wanted to go for the ride (wedding in Monsey).

Since I didn't think I was going to stay for the whole thing since my back was hurting. He said OK.

Due to traffic I got back around 11:30P and my back was hurting from earlier that day.

So I brought him to my house, thinking I'd bring him to his house the next day.

He watched TV, then fell asleep in the front room. I went to the middle room to sleep.

That next morning he was still sleeping when I was ready to leave. So I woke him and told him I'll bring him to his house when I get back afterwards.

Towards the end of the day when I saw the flyers, I panicked and was affraid [sic].

When I got home he was still there. So I made him a tuna sandwich.

I was still in panic from the fliers and affraid [sic] to bring him home (his house).

That is when approximately I went for a towel to smother him (in the side room.)

He fought back a little bit until [sic] eventually he stopped breathing.

Afterwards, I panicked because I didn't know what do with the body.

After about 15-20 minutes, I carried the body to the front room to start by placing him on the red mattress where I cut one leg at the hip.

Then carried the two parts to the back room placing the two parts between freezer and frigerator [sic], then placing plastics covering floor and table.

Was having trouble the leg to fit in the bag, so I had to cut at bottom. Then separating the other leg in same places, I place the parts in freezer, then showered.

Went to clean up a little then took a second shower.

I panicked and looked for something to transport the parts. Then putting the parts in a suitcase.

Then carrying suitcase to the car. Then left.

Placing suitcase in backseat on floor behind passenger side. Then pulled out.

Drove around approximately around 20 minutes. Before placing it in dumpster on 20st just before 4th Ave.

Then went home. To clean and organize.

I understand this maybe wrong and I'm sorry for hurt that I've caused.Levi Aron7/13/118:00AM
