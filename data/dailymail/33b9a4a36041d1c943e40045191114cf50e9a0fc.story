Ukrainians gave decisive backing for a pro-Western future today as election results showed a massive rejection of parties wanting to cosy up to Moscow. 

The historic parliamentary poll gave the green light to President Petro Poroshenko to seek membership both of the European Union and NATO and he signaled he wanted to begin talks as early as today. 

With 60 per cent of the vote counted, the three main pro-Western parties alone stood to win 54 per cent of the vote combined.

But the result leaves the country more divided than ever, with no vote taking place in pro-Moscow areas of Lugansk and Donetsk, nor in Crimea which was annexed by Vladimir Putin earlier this year. 

As the results came in heavy shelling erupted near Donetsk, ending a calm period during parliamentary elections.

Several dozen Grad multiple rockets could be heard exploding early in the morning in the area of Putilovsky, a Donetsk neighbourhood near the city's ruined airport. 

Because no voting took place in Lugansk, Donetsk and Crimea, 27 seats will remain empty in the new parliament.

Donetsk and Lugansk will vote next week in an unofficial poll likely to bring closer a full-scale separation from Kiev. Yesterday the regions switched their clocks to Moscow time. 

'More than three quarters of voters who took part in the polls gave strong and irreversible backing to Ukraine's path to Europe,' said Poroshenko, a 49 year old chocolate baron whose party scored well, giving backing to his peace plan. 

The president thanked voters for backing a 'democratic, reformist, pro-Ukrainian and Pro-European majority'.

He said coalition consultations should start today. 

The BBC reported him as saying: 'We have these 10 days when we must create... the best government in Ukraine because no other government will cope with the challenges that the country is facing today.'

The partial vote count published today covers only 225 of the 450 seats. Results for constituency seats will not come in for a few days.

Prime Minister Arseniy Yatsenyuk's bloc was the other major pro-Western winner in the polls, gaining 21.6 per cent. President Petro Poroshenko's party had 21.4 percent. A new pro-European party based in western Ukraine was running third with 11 percent.

The Fatherland party of former prime minister Yulia Tymoshenko, who has argued strongly for NATO membership and is likely to join a pro-Europe coalition, had 5.7 percent of the vote. 

Strongly nationalist groups - dubbed neo-Nazis by Moscow - performed badly, while no Communists were expected in the new parliament.

The remnants of the pro-Moscow party of ousted president Viktor Yanukovych secured around eight per cent of the votes.

Yanukovych, was driven from power in February after he refused to sign an agreement on closer ties with the European Union. The ousting prompted separatists to seize government buildings in April, and anger has simmered since. Some candidates were reportedly attacked during the election. 

The influence of pro-Russian groups looks set to be greatly diminished once the election results are finalised.This reality could fuel fresh tension in the future with Russia which condemned Yanukovich's ousting as a 'fascist' coup and went on to annex Crimea in March and back anti-Kiev rebellions by separatists in the east. 

At least 3,700 people have been killed since April, 300 of them in clashes between the Ukrainian army and separatists around Donetsk's airport despite a truce being agreed on 5 September.

The war with pro-Russian rebels in the industrial east and Russia's earlier annexation of the southern Crimean region has cast a dark shadow over the election

Russia had criticised Ukraine's election campaign before the vote but Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said today that Moscow would recognize its outcome.

He told Russian media: 'It is very important that in Ukraine, at last, there will be a government that is occupied not with ... the pulling of Ukraine either to the West or to the East, but with the real problems that are facing the country.'

President Poroshenko has laid out an ambitious agenda envisioning significant changes to Ukraine's police, justice and tax systems, defence sector and health care - all to be completed by 2020. Among the tougher decisions ahead will be allowing the cost of utilities in the cash-strapped country to float in line with market demands.

Anton Karpinsky, a 36-year-old doctor in Kiev, said he was delighted that Ukraine will now have a pro-Western government.

He said: 'Our revolution and fight was not in vain. The election shows that Ukraine sees its future in Europe and NATO, and we will get there step by step.'

Stepan Burko, a 67-year-old retiree whose $140 monthly pension barely covers his food bills, said difficult times remain ahead despite President Poroshenko's optimism.

He said: 'The only certain winners in Ukraine are slogans. But it is much more difficult to overcome poverty and war. 

'If it weren't for my children's help, I would go hungry. These are the problems the new authorities should tackle.'

Some hoped that a strong government could negotiate an end to the war.

Tatyana Rublevskaya, a 48-year-old shopkeeper said: 'The main thing is to put a stop to the war. We are so tired of killings, shelling and weapons.'

 The snap election has come eight months after a street revolt overthrew Moscow-backed president Viktor Yanukovych

Although a low turn out is expected in the east of the country, amid continued fighting between Ukrainian forces and pro-Russian seperatists, Ukraine is expected to elect a pro-western parliament in a further move away from Russian influence

The main parties vying for seats are the Poroshenko Bloc, Prime Minister Arseny Yatsenyuk's People's Front, Oleh Lyashko's nationalist Radical Party and former Prime Minister Yulia Tymoshenko's Fatherland Party

President Poroshenko called the the snap election eight months after a street revolt overthrew Moscow-backed president Yanukovych, sparking conflict with Russia and a crisis between the Kremlin and Ukraine's Western allies.

The war with pro-Russian rebels in the industrial east and Russia's earlier annexation of the southern Crimean region has cast a dark shadow over the election. Voters in Crimea and in separatist-controlled areas of the eastern Lugansk and Donetsk provinces were unable to vote.

This is around five million of Ukraine's 36.5 million-strong electorate and means 27 seats in the 450-seat parliament will remain empty.

The severing of those regions means the once peaceful, but now bloody divide between the mostly Russian-speaking east and Ukrainian-speaking west will take another step toward becoming permanent. 

Polls show a majority of Ukrainians support economic and democratic reforms - especially a crackdown on corruption - leading eventually to European Union membership.

Last night, President Poroshenko promised 'an entirely new parliament' that was 'reforming, not corrupt, pro-Ukrainian and pro-European, not pro-Soviet.'

A Moscow-backed truce signed by Kiev and the separatists on September 5 has calmed the worst fighting, although there are daily violations around the largest rebel-held city Donetsk.

Insurgent leaders, who are not allowing polling stations to open in their areas, have announced their own leadership vote, which Kiev does not recognise on November 2.

President Poroshenko insisted Saturday that there could be 'no military solution' to the conflict.

'No criticism, no matter how acute and painful, will stop me from finding a peaceful way out of the current situation,' he said. 

Thousands of Polish troops will be moved towards its eastern borders in a historic realignment of a military structure built in the Cold War, the country's defense minister has said.

Tomasz Siemoniak said the troops are needed in the east because of the conflict in neighboring Ukraine, saying: 'The geopolitical situation has changed, we have the biggest crisis of security since the Cold War and we must draw conclusions from that.'

Mr Siemoniak said that at least three military bases in the east will see their populations increase from the current 30 per cent of capacity to almost 90 per cent by 2017, and that more military hardware will be moved to those bases as well.

He said it was not some 'nervous or radical move' but because of this 'situation of threat we would like those units in the east of Poland to be more efficient'.

Although Poland joined NATO in 1999, most of its 120,000-member army is based along the country's western border, as a relic of its former status as a Soviet Bloc member.

The units in the east, like the air defense unit in Siedlce, have only 30 per cent of jobs filled in line with a plan that calls for 100 per cent of troops 'only in the case of war.'
