Quadruplets born to a Dallas-area minister and his wife already share something with their father.

The boy and three girls delivered Monday at Baylor Regional Medical Center at Grapevine arrived on their dad's 36th birthday.

Josh Hall, who's a youth pastor at Gateway Church in Fort Worth, said he's 'ecstatic' about his expanded family. Brooks, Sadie, Elle and Ivy join two sisters - 4-year-old Zoe and 2-year-old Kaytlin.

A Baylor spokeswoman on Thursday said mother Anna and the quadruplets, born more than a month premature, are in good condition.

Hospital officials say Brooks at birth weighed 3 pounds 11 ounces, Sadie was 2 pounds 15 ounces, Elle was 3 pounds 6 ounces and Ivy was 3 pounds 5 ounces. Elle and Ivy are identical twins.

'We feel very blessed to welcome these four new children into our family,'  the proud dad said.

The family already has two other girls, 4-year-old Zoe and 2-year-old Kaytlin.

'It was an exciting afternoon here,' said hospital President Steve Newton.

Nurse manager Susan West said that the hospital delivered more than 2,500 babies last year.

'Since this is the hospital's first set of quads,' West said, 'this birth is extra special to us.'

The average quads are born at about 29.5 weeks, said Dr. Sherri Kappler, medical director of the hospital's Neonatal Intensive Care Unit.

Anna Hall 'was able to reach almost 32 weeks, which was great news for the babies,' Dr. Kappler said.

A full-term baby is born between 37 and 42 weeks of gestation.

Anything prior to that is considered premature. About 10 percent of all newborns require special monitoring in the NICU, making sure that they are breathing, feeding and developing properly.

Memorable: Nurse manager Susan West said that the hospital delivered more than 2,500 babies last year. 'Since this is the hospital's first set of quads,' West said, 'this birth is extra special to us.'

The quad babies will remain in the hospital for a few weeks.

'Because these babies are often very small, they need special care to aid in growth and development before they can go home. Breathing and feeding may be difficult for these tiny patients,' the hospital said.

'We are just praying everybody is going to be good sleepers good eaters. It is going to be fun,' added mother Anna.

In March, Steven and Michelle Seals gave birth to quintuplets, four girls and a boy, at Baylor University Medical Center in Dallas.

Spiritual: 'We feel very blessed to welcome these four new children into our family,' Josh Hall said.

Checking up: Most quadruplet pregnancies last 29.5 weeks. Anna Hall's pregnancy lasted close to 32 weeks

Blessed: The Halls already have two daughters who are four and two years old. Making their big day extra special, the quadruplets were born on dad Josh's birthday
