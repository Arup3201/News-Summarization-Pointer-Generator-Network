According to a tourism website, the market town of Coleshill ‘boasts a number of quirky curiosities’.

But a newly found status as the Viagra capital of England was probably not what the writers had in mind.

Statistics show that the North Warwickshire town, with a population of around 6,000, consumes Viagra and similar anti-impotence remedies with a passion which leaves other communities trailing.

Up for loving: The market town of Coleshill in North Warwickshire which has the highest rate of prescriptions for Viagra and other anti-impotence drugs of any region in England

Last year, 54.87 prescriptions per 
1,000 men were issued by GPs in the district for erectile dysfunction 
drugs such as Viagra, Cialis and Levitra, placing the town well ahead of
its nearest rival for the title, Wychavon, across the border in 
Worcestershire.

When the Daily Mail visited Coleshill yesterday, it did not take long to find one local who readily admitted taking a sex drug.

Al
Gorman, who works as a male stripper, proudly admitted to using Viagra,
and boasted: ‘It boosts my private life and my work life.’

The
father of three, who is divorced, said: ‘I use Viagra all the time. I 
want to perform well and don’t want to let anyone down.

‘I’m not surprised we have more users than anywhere else in the country, because we’re more fun.’

Fellow
resident Des Christie said he was also not surprised that the peaceful 
town had been revealed as a stronghold for Viagra users.

The 39-year-old leisure centre manager said: ‘There’s a lot of older people living here who are young at heart and energetic.’

And
Martin Raybone, a 63-year-old insurance assessor, added: ‘We’re a fun 
bunch in Coleshill and it seems most of us enjoy happy, healthy sex 
lives.

‘We have nothing to complain about here – there’s no aggro, no litter and we’re no Victor Meldrew brigade.

‘People have well-paid jobs and decent pensions, and we like to go out or stay in and have a good time.’

Until
now, Coleshill has been most well known as the original home of the 
company that invented Brylcreem and the UK headquarters of the Subaru 
motor company. And one of those ‘quirky curiosities’ that used to be the
town’s main boasts are the stocks outside the old market hall, which 
were once used to punish drunks and bakers who sold underweight loaves.

The
Sunday Times analysis of the NHS figures found that Wychavon was the 
second-biggest consumer of erectile dysfunction drugs, with 43 
prescriptions per 1,000 men. Dartford in Kent was in third place (42 per
1,000 men), with Hastings in East Sussex (41 per 1,000 men) and East 
Lindsey in Lincolnshire (40 per 1,000 men) making up the top five.

The
statistics revealed that erectile dysfunction medication is more common
in rural and coastal areas, while London, Cambridge and Newcastle upon 
Tyne had the lowest rates of use.

But
the figures include only NHS prescriptions, and those living in cities 
are thought more likely than rural residents to acquire supplies through
private doctors.

Simon 
Kennedy, 38, owner of the George and Dragon pub, believes the number of 
hostelries in the town might be linked to the rise in Viagra 
prescriptions.

 He said: 
‘Perhaps they need some assistance after visiting all the pubs. There 
are only a couple of chemists in the town so they must be well stocked 
up on Viagra.’
