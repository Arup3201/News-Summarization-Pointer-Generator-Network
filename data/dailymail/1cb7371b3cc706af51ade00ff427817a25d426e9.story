The secret FA files on the doomed 2018 World Cup bid that were not shared with FIFA ethics investigator Michael Garcia are to be shown to the Department of Culture, Media and Sport (DCMS) Select Committee.

Former Minister for Sport Gerry Sutcliffe revealed the FA would ‘reluctantly’ allow some MPs to view the dossier on the voting FIFA executive members, which British intelligence services helped to compile. Sutcliffe was speaking at the pressure group New FIFA Now’s summit at the European Parliament in Brussels.

England 2018 personnel did not hand over the files to Garcia because a lot of the fine details garnered during the bid from all quarters were based on rumour, hearsay and innuendo and the FA were only comfortable providing evidence supported by hard facts to specific questions.

Sutcliffe said: ‘We will see what was held at that time. The FA have been very cagey about it all. They were reluctant at first and said we could not see it, that it was restricted — clearly it’s not. Government was asked to give guarantees so we need to know about this.’

Sutcliffe’s news surprised former FA chairman Lord Triesman, who made the FA making these documents available part of his wishlist for New FIFA Now, who are campaigning for the establishment of a FIFA reform commission.

Triesman, who predictably did not waste the opportunity the Brussels platform gave him to lay into an ‘absurd (Sepp) Blatter presiding over a deeply flawed set of people’, said the select committee would now be the rightful judges of this hidden FA cache of World Cup material.

Summit organiser MP Damian Collins said the FA sitting on evidence all this time made a ‘sham’ of their whitewash probe into Triesman’s allegations, made under Parliamentary privilege, of bidding corruption by named FIFA Exco members.

Fifa presidential hopeful David Ginola is being paid by bookmaker Paddy Power to run for top job

The circus that is the FIFA presidential candidature of three no-hopers on Wednesday saw Chilean Harold Mayne-Nicholls claim he had five national associations waiting to back him if he decides to stand and former FIFA executive Jerome Champagne insist he had between one and four unnamed supporters. David Ginola, who is stunt-funded by bookmaker Paddy Power, called off a meeting in Brussels, having first swerved the FIFA reform summit held there.

Horseracing specialist Clare Balding’s surprising decision to present BBC’s men’s and women’s Boat Race coverage on April 11 rather than the flagship Grand National on Channel 4, might have something to do with the rowing event being sponsored by American investment giants the Mellon Corporation.

The late Paul Mellon owned legendary racehorse Mill Reef, which was trained by Clare’s father, Ian. 

Mellon rewarded Balding for his Mill Reef triumphs with a trust fund that paid for the entire education of his children Clare and Andrew at top private schools. ‘Mr Mellon, as we called him, paid for it, the whole lot,’ said Clare in an interview.

Roy thinks P8 is Gr8

The P8 gatherings — loosely named after G8 political summits — that England rugby head coach Stuart Lancaster surprisingly broke ranks to talk about this week, are the brainchild of sports conference organiser James Worrall, who owns the successful Leaders in Sport brand.

England rugby head coach Stuart Lancaster swaps ideas with other high-performance leaders

The meetings, first revealed by Sports Agenda last November when the last such forum took place at England’s rugby base at Pennyhill Park in the build-up to the Australia game, are strictly private affairs where high-performance leaders swap ideas and experiences in confidence.

Lancaster, England manager Roy Hodgson and England cricket head coach Peter Moores are all enthusiastic about the P8 initiative, as are Ryder Cup captain Paul McGinley and top cycling coach Sir Dave Brailsford.

Roy Hodgson’s stated preference for England’s training base at Euro 2016 to be somewhere his players can cycle to from the hotel — as opposed to the hour-plus bus commute in Rio — is no longer the priority it first seemed. Hodgson, administrator Michelle Farrer and performance services chief Dave Reddin are still considering locations in France.
