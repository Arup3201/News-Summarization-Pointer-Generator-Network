DeAndre Yedlin is refusing to look ahead to his dream move to Tottenham Hotspur next season and insists he is concentrating on his duties with MLS club Seattle Sounders. 

Yedlin rose to international prominence with a number of standout performances for Jurgen Klinsmann's USA side at the World Cup. 

The 21-year-old defender attracted the attention of several clubs and sealed a £2.4million deal with Spurs in August. Yedlin has stayed on loan with the Sounders but is set to arrive at White Hart Lane for the beginning of the 2015 Premier League campaign.

'Right now, I'm just trying to focus on the MLS season,' he said. 

Yedlin was part of an impressive USA team that posted some impressive performances in Brazil including a 2-1 win over Ghana, a draw against Portugal as well as a battling 1-0 defeat to eventual champions Germany. 

Despite Tim Howard's record-breaking heroics in goal, Yedlin's side crashed out to Belgium in the last 16, and he cites the tournament as a turning point in his development as a player.

'I think I grew a lot (while playing for the USA in Brazil),' he explained. 

'Now I know I can do it,' It gave me a big amount of confidence. Hopefully I can that into the rest of the season and my next step with Tottenham.' 

For now, his Premier League ambitions are on hold and the 21-year-old is looking forward to getting back into camp with his international comrades for the first time since their World Cup heroics.  

'It's an honor to be called into any camp,' Yedlin said. 'I'm looking forward to getting back and playing with all the guys. It's been a lot of fun.
