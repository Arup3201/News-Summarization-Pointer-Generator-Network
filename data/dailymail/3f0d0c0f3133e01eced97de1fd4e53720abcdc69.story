Trenches 23,000 feet deep, psychedelic spirals of lava and the highest known mountain in the solar system - these are just some of the highlights see by the Mars Express spacecraft over the past decade.

Mars Express, launched in 2003, has now orbited the planet nearly 12,500 times, providing scientists with unprecedented images and data collected by its range of scientific instruments.

The data have been used to create an almost global digital topographic model of Mars' surface, providing a unique flyby video.

The images in this video were taken by the High Resolution Stereo Camera (HSRC) and were put together by the DLR German Aerospace Center as part of the ten years of Mars Express celebrations.

‘For the first time, we can see Mars spatially – in three dimensions,’ said Ralf Jaumann, project manager for the mission at the German Aerospace Center (DLR).

Mars Express reached its destination on 25 December 2003 – and caused an initial shock.

The HRSC took its first close look down towards Mars and sent back an almost plain white image.

This was the first of many images of a crater taken from the spacecraft's camera at an altitude of 277 km

As well as images from the Mars' Express, Nasa's Mars Exploration Rover Opportunity has been capturing images from the ground.

The above southward uphill view was taken when the rover began to ascend the northwestern slope of 'Solander Point' on the western rim of Mars' Endeavour Crater.

The view combines five frames taken by Opportunity's navigation camera on the 3,463rd Martian day, or sol, of the rover's work on Mars.

Opportunity had begun climbing the hill on Sol 3451 and completed three additional uphill drives before reaching this point.

The rover team is using the rover to investigate outcrops on the slope. The northward-facing slope will tilt the rover's solar panels toward the sun in the southern-hemisphere winter sky, providing an important energy advantage for continuing mobile operations through the upcoming winter.

‘Everyone just swallowed,’ recalled Mr Jaumann.

Scientists were worried that the camera had failed. But one of the nine different channels of the camera – the infrared channel – was still showing weak contours of the surface of Mars.

The solution to the problem was quickly found; the sensitivity of the camera close to Mars was much greater than that expected by the researchers, meaning that the first image was overexposed.

Two Mars orbits later, on 10 January 2004, and with the correct exposure time, the first of many successful images was acquired from an altitude of 277 kilometres.

Since then an almost complete 3D global view of the Red Planet has been created from the numerous images.

The scientists put the camera images together piece by piece like a jigsaw puzzle, creating a global map of Mars.

Of the 145 million square kilometres of the surface of Mars, 97 million have already been covered at very high resolution, where one pixel corresponds to less than 20 metres on the surface.

Almost the entire surface of Mars has now been imaged at a resolution of better than 100 metres.

The 3D view of the valleys, canyons and lava flows is possible because of the unusual imaging principle used by the camera.

Valles Marineris pictured here is a system of canyons that runs along the Martian surface east of the Tharsis region. At more than 4,000 km long and 200 km wide, the Valles Marineris rift system is one of the larger canyons of the solar system

Nine light-sensitive detectors sweep the surface in sequence from nine different observation angles.

This data is then processed into three-dimensional images by the DLR planetary researchers.

‘We can see the entire topography almost as well as if we were standing on Mars ourselves,’ said Mrs Jaumann.

Although the conditions on Mars are no longer suitable for the existence of liquid water, at some time in its past water must have flowed over its surface, scouring out deep valleys in the highlands and creating huge outflow valleys three to four billion years ago.

Using the camera's super resolution channel, images can be acquired that are so rich in detail that geological processes in which water was involved can be seen.

It is likely that there were periods of flowing and standing water during the history of this planet, which is so dry and dusty today.

Of the 145 million square kilometres of the surface of Mars, 97 million have already been covered at very high resolution, where one pixel corresponds to less than 20 metres on the surface

This means that different climatic conditions must have been predominant in the planet’s early history.

This is also clearly visible in the three-dimensional camera images showing structures near the equator that have been caused by glaciation.

‘The Mars Express mission was due to end after one Mars year – or about two Earth years,’ said Mr Jaumann.

But during the past 10 years the European Space Agency (ESA) has kept extending the mission. The spacecraft is now due to continue orbiting Mars until the end of 2014.

Mr Jaumann added: ‘That is actually the bottom line on the past 10 years; everything is still functioning perfectly and we are still acquiring new data that is important for Mars research.’
