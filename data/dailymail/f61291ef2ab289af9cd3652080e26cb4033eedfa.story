The two Florida students arrested for harassing their classmate Rebecca Sedwick until she committed suicide last month have been suspended from school.

Katelyn Roman, 12, and Guadalupe Shaw, 14, were arrested earlier this month for stalking Rebecca. Rebecca killed herself on September 10 by jumping off an abandoned concrete factory.

'When you're accused of a felony you're automatically suspended from school for one year,' a source 'close to the situation' told RadarOnline.

Since her arrest, Katelyn's parents have hired Casey Anthony's attorney Jose Baez to represent her.

The same source close to the family said that Katelyn's family are worried about their honor-student's chances of getting back into the public school system.

'There is no guarantee that after a year you are allowed back into the public school system and that is if you are acquitted of all charges even,' the source said.

According to the source, Katelyn had the third highest state testing score in Polk County a few years ago but now won't even be able to continue her education electronically.

The two girls were part of a group of 15 girls who tormented Rebecca Sedwick at Crystal Lake Middle School in Lakeland, Florida.

Polk County Sheriff Grady Judd said Guadalupe was singled out for arrest after she posted an insensitive tweet about Rebecca's death.

'Yes IK [I know] I bullied REBECCA nd [sic] she killed her self but IDGAF [I don't give a f***],' Guadalupe allegedly posted.

'We decided that we can't leave her out there. Who else is she going to torment, who else is she going to harass?' he said.

But Sheriff Judd also announced last week that the bullying may have only been one part of Rebecca's decision to commit suicide.

Judd said that Rebecca was also having problems at home and these may have contributed to the state of her mind on the day of her death.

He told CBS she slept on a recliner instead of a bed and her sister slept on the couch, while the girls' clothes were kept in 'grocery sacks' in the living room.

Rebecca's mother Tricia Norman has been in trouble with the law since as far back as 1995 and has criminal convictions for writing bad checks, fraud and probation violation.

David Henry, the lead attorney on the 
case, told Crimesider that Rebecca's father was not involved in the 
family's life and that Norman 'was doing her best' with her children.

Katelyn was Rebecca's former best friend, but Judd said the 14-year-old turned her against Rebecca. Other girls also stopped being friends with her in fear of being bullied, the sheriff said.

'Several students corroborated stories of both girls bullying Sedwick on different occasions, through name-calling, intimidation, threats to beat her up, and at least one actual physical fight,' the sheriff said.

It is believed the bullying started when Guadalupe started dating Rebecca's ex-boyfriend.

Witnesses told investigators she sent messages to Rebecca, calling her ugly, telling her to 'drink bleach and die', and encouraging her to kill herself.

Rebecca's computer searches revealed she had searched for ways to commit suicide and asked questions like, 'What is overweight for a 13-year-old girl' .

One of the Florida girl's screensavers also showed Rebecca with her head resting on a railroad track.

She changed one of her online screen names to 'That Dead Girl.' She messaged a boy: 'I'm jumping.'

Polk County Sheriff Judd said Rebecca had been 'absolutely terrorized' by the other girls.

'We can see from what we've been investigating so far that Rebecca wasn't attacking back,' Judd said.

'She appeared to be beat down. She appeared to have a defeatist attitude. And quite frankly, the entire investigation is exceptionally disturbing.'

Even when her mother took Rebecca out of school, the bullying was carried out online.

The bullying started over a boy last year at Crystal Lake Middle School and at one point she was suspended for fighting with another student - believed to be Katelyn.

Last December, Rebecca was hospitalized for three days after cutting her wrists because of what she said was bullying, according to the sheriff.

'When she was being bullied at Crystal Lake Middle, she used to come home every day and tell me how she wasn’t worth anything, that she was ugly, how she was stupid,' her mother Tricia Norman said after her death.

'And I said, ''Baby what on earth would make you think that? You’re the most beautiful person I know and the smartest person I know.'''

Later, after Rebecca complained that she had been pushed in the hallway and that another girl wanted to fight her, Rebecca's mother began home-schooling her, Judd said.

This fall, Rebecca started at a new school, Lawton Chiles Middle Academy, and loved it, Judd said. But the bullying continued online.

'She put on a perfect, happy face. She never told me,' Tricia Norman told the Lakeland Ledger.

'I never had a clue. I mean, she told me last year when she was being bullied, but not this year, and I have no idea why.'

Once police checked her cell phone they discovered that the bullying had not stopped, especially on Kik Messenger, Instagram and Ask.fm.

'They would tell her she's ugly, stupid, nobody liked her go kill herself," Ms Norman said.

She has started a Facebook page to try to fight back against online bullies, called Rebecca Sedwick Against Bullying.

Ms Norman told 10 News she was inspired to start it after reading her daughter's journal.

In it, Rebecca had written: 'Every day more and more kids kill themselves because of bullying. How many lives have to be lost until people realize words do matter?'

Ms Norman wants online bullies to face harsher consequences, and begged other young victims to stay strong and seek help, adding: 'Don't ever give up, like Becca did.'
