Dorothy Deaves has opened up about how she was the one responsible for igniting a forbidden love between John and Jenny Deaves (Pictured)

John Deaves' incestuous love affair with his biological daughter Jenny created national headlines in 2008.

The pair were famously shunned by the Australian public after a shocking interview with 60 Minutes revealed they had spawned two children.

Now, more than six years on, John's second wife Dorothy Deaves has opened up about how she was the one responsible for igniting their forbidden love.

She has told 9 stories how she fuelled their nine-year relationship, encouraging her husband to reach out to his daughters from his first marriage.

'They were in contact (after John separated from Jenny's mother), but it was actually me who brought the contact on ... I said he should keep in contact with his daughters.'

It is understood John and Jenny were estranged prior to reuniting back in 2000, only seeing each other three times. But once reunited their relationship quickly evolved into an intimate and incestuous affair that ended Dorothy and Johns' 12 years of marriage.

They had two children together, a girl who was born normally healthy, and a second child which died at birth

In the 2008 interview with Channel Nine's 60 Minutes Jenny told the program that her platonic feelings for her father John soon became something much more when they were reunited back in 2000.

'After I'd been there quite a few days I started to notice my feelings were changing and that that I was seeing him as a man, as a person, as somebody who was loving, caring, who, like, yeah I was looking at him and sort of going 'Oh, he's not too bad'," she said.

Jenny, who was 31 and married with children, had gone to stay with her 53-year-old father and Dorothy, his second wife, in Port Pirie, South Australia.

Their eight year relationship sparked a court proceeding, where the pair pleaded guilty to two counts each of incest, the second relating to the intercourse that resulted in the birth of their healthy daughter in 2007 and the first count relating to the conception of their first child who died in 2001.

They separated in 2008 after a court ruled their relationship broke the law, but they continued to see each other until the relationship reportedly ended in 2009.

Dorothy revealed to 9 Stories that she and Jenny's mother, Joan, tried to split up the incestuous duo and tried in vain to have police intervene but they continually 'escaped' from the law.

"We tried to split them up, her mum (Joan) and I did. We tried bringing the law onto them, but they escaped," Dorothy said.

She said the pair have never once apologised for ruining her marriage but she holds no grudge.

'She's not with him anymore and that's all I care about,' Dorothy said.

'They still think they didn't do anything wrong. Now I'm just glad I got rid of him. I'm glad it's all finished.'
