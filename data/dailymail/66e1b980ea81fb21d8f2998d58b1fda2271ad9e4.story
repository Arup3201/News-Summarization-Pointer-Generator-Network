Brazilian midfielder Oscar has revealed that he has spoken to Paris Saint-Germain - but insists he will remain at Chelsea next season.

PSG have already agreed a £50million deal to sign Oscar's Chelsea and Brazil team-mate David Luiz, and they have also made their interest in taking attacking midfielder Eden Hazard from Stamford Bridge to the French capital clear.

But Oscar insists he will not be following in defender Luiz's footsteps by joining the Ligue 1 champions this summer and will remain a part of Jose Mourinho's new, re-shaped squad in West London next season.

The 22-year-old told L'Equipe: 'I had contacts with PSG, that is true, but it did not go any further.

'And next season, I will stay at Chelsea.'

Oscar is currently playing for Brazil in the 2014 World Cup and has helped his nation qualify for the last 16 where they will face South American rivals Chile.

He has 34 international caps and has netted 10 times, including the final goal in Brazil's 3-1 opening win over Croatia at the World Cup.

The playmaker joined Chelsea from Internacional for £25m in 2012 and has made 111 appearances, scoring 23 goals.
