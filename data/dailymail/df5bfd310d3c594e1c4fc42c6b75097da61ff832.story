Snow has hit this morning as Britain was warned to brace itself for Siberian gales bringing  five days of sub-zero weather and temperatures dropping to -11C.

London has had its first significant snowfall of the year as flurries moved in across the South East overnight with forecasters predicting a new band of freezing cold air from northern Russia will reach the country by Thursday.

There are yellow warnings of snow and ice in place  for eastern counties, the far west of Wales and Cornwall as well as Scotland, Yorkshire and the East Midlands, which will remain in place until around midday tomorrow. Parts of Scotland and Northern Ireland were hit by more snow.

Snow has hit this morning as Britain, including Kingston upon Thames, pictured, was warned to brace itself for Siberian gales bringing five days of sub-zero weather and temperatures dropping to -11C

Prediction: The Met Office said parts of the UK, in Kingston left and Battersea, right, would awake to a thin carpet of snow today, with sub-zero temperatures expected for some of the country overnight.

The big chill: Residents in West London woke to snow on the ground this morning as flurries moved in across the South East overnight

Freeze: Parts of the capital were under a blanket of snow with forecasters predicting a new band of freezing cold air from northern Russia will reach the country by Thursday

Arctic blast: Heavy downfalls of snow are shown here in the Ealing area of West London overnight

The Met Office said parts of the UK would awake to a thin carpet of snow today, with sub-zero temperatures expected for some of the country overnight.

While some snow fell in London overnight, the coldest weather was reserved for areas which saw less snow and clearer skies.

The village of Dalwhinnie in the Highlands endured -11C, and it was just a few degrees warmer in Katesbridge Co Down where the mercury plummeted to -8C (17.6F).

The snow is unlikely to fall in great volumes or lie, said Met Office forecaster Kirk Waite, but he added the cold weather could bring about tricky driving conditions.

'We are not really expecting much in the way of accumulation as it will be mostly a light snowfall,' he said. 'But the cold weather will create some potentially difficult travel conditions through rush hour with a risk of icy patches.'

Gritters were out in force in Hertfordshire with salting trucks already on their second run by 4.30am.

Later today it will struggle to get above 6C (42.8F) in parts of England, including London, Mr Waite added.

For most of the UK it is expected to stay dry with some sunny spells today while there could be the chance of some wintry showers in coastal areas and temperatures reaching zero degrees in Scotland and 4C in the South, according to the Met Office. 

The cold front will move eastwards tomorrow, with the eastern coasts of Scotland and England still seeing snow showers as well as a strong northeasterly wind.

Higher ground in the North York Moors and Lincolnshire Wolds could see up to 3.9ins (10cm) of snow, according to the Met Office, with a yellow 'be aware' warning remaining in place throughout the day. 

Snow in Scotland and Northern Ireland will gradually die out on Tuesday with some snow showers expected to affect parts of the east coast of England -and even London could see a dusting - as conditions remain cold for the rest of the week.

Winds will gradually increase and become strong in the south as the first gusts from Eastern Europe start to sweep in, with the potential of some snow flurries in London.

Siberian gales: This weather map shows a band of high-altitude cold air (blue area) expected to sweep across the UK this week from Russia

Met Office forecaster Laura Young said: 'Nights are forecast to be -11C in Scotland and -5C in England. The south east could certainly see 1-2cm on higher ground including the Chilterns and North Downs. London has the potential for a dusting.

'An easterly flow with air coming from Siberia and Russia will be going right across the southern half of the UK ahead of the weekend.

'It will feel very cold, with days at 3C to 4C days but feeling colder in the wind.

'The North will have a less cold north-westerly flow, which is expected to replace the South's easterlies into next week - although the pattern is expected to flip back at easterlies at times ahead.'

Meteorologist, Mark Wilson, added: 'The weather will quieten down after Wednesday and be drier, but it will stay cold.'

Forecaster Brian Gaze of The Weather Outlook said: 'Bitterly cold easterly air is due from the continent, with large area of high pressure drawing in some very cold air from Russia, blocking milder westerly Atlantic systems and making the UK cold.'

Golden: It may be freezing everywhere else but this photograph of rows of yellow daffodils was taken yesterday in Cornwall by Roy Curtis

While parts of Britain were shivering in the depths of an icy winter one, small corner of Cornwall looked a picture of spring beauty.

Photographer Roy Curtis captured the neat rows of newly emerged yellow daffodils as they soaked up the warmth of the sun at Nansidwell near Mawnan Smith on Sunday.

They were reminiscent of one of the most famous poems in English literature - Wordsworth's Daffodils - which contains the lines:

'I wandered lonely as a cloud

That floats on high o'er vales and hills,

When all at once I saw a crowd,

A host, of golden daffodils;

Beside the lake, beneath the trees,

Fluttering and dancing in the breeze.'

The idyllic scene overlooking Falmouth Bay was in sharp contrast to those further north where ice and snow had blanketed parts of the country.
