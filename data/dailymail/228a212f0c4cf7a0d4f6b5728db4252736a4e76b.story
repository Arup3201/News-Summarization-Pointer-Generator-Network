While there's no prehistoric land hidden at the centre of our planet, as author Jules Verne imagined, the Earth's core may not at all be like what scientists have led us to believe.

Geologists have discovered that the Earth's inner core - previously thought to be a solid lump of iron - may in fact have its own even smaller core within it.

Using the seismic waves that reverberate across the planet after earthquakes, researchers have been able to gain new insight into what lies at the centre of our world. 

Researchers have found that the Earth's inner core has an interior structure of its own made of iron crystals that point in different directions, as can be seen marked by the blue lines in the diagram above

The findings could mean that our understanding of Earth's interior, and its history, will need to be rewritten. 

Scientists found that rather than a solid ball of iron lying within the molten mass of the outer core, the inner core changes in structure about half way through.

They discovered a distinct inner inner core that is about half the diameter of what was believed to be the solid inner core, which is about the size of the moon.

The Earth is made up of three major layers - the crust, the hot layer of magma known as the mantle and the core.

Geologists have known for some time that the core is made of a liquid outer core of iron and nickel and a solid inner core.

It is thought that the liquid outer core, which reaches 4,000 to 5,000 degrees C, is responsible for controlling the Earth's magnetic field and helps protect the planet from charged particles from the sun.

Temperatures in the inner core, which is around 750 miles thick, reach between 5,000 and 7,000 degrees C, although the extreme pressures there means that the iron it is made from is solid.

In 2004, scientists discovered that the inner core rotates in the liquid of the outer core surrounding it far faster than the Earth itself spins.

They calculated that every 400 years or so it overtakes the spin of the rest of the planet and may help to explain why the north and south poles have 'wandered' over time.

However, more recent research in 2011 has suggested that the inner core may spin slower than this - gaining just one degree on the rest of the Earth every million years or so. 

This easterly spin also helps to drive the rotation of the outer inner core in the opposite direction. 

It is this strange dynamic that generates the geomagnetic field that deflects potentially harmful particles from our planet.

Professor Xianodong Song, a geologist at the University of Illinois, said the structure of two inner cores could help reveal new details about how the Earth first formed.

He said: 'Even though the inner core is small - smaller than the moon - it has some really interesting features.

'The fact that we have two regions that are distinctly different may tell us something about how the inner core has been evolving.

'For example, over the history of the Earth, the inner core might have had a very dramatic change in its deformation regime.

'It might hold the key to how the planet has evolved.'

The science fiction author Jules Verne speculated that there could be a hidden world, frozen in time, lying beneath our feet in his novel Journey to the Centre of the Earth.

However, geologists have established that the Earth is made up of three major layers - the crust, the hot layer of magma known as the mantle and the core.

They have known for some time that the core is made of a liquid outer core of iron and nickel and a solid inner core. 

But in the latest research, Professor Song and his colleagues from the Nanjing University in China, found that even this inner core is more complex than previously believed.

While the iron crystals in the outer layers of the inner core are aligned in a north south direction, within the inner inner core they point roughly east to west.

The researchers used the 'echo' of seismic waves that bounce around the planet after an earthquake to build up a picture of the Earth's interior.

Arrays of sensors in locations around the world, including Venezuela and southeast China allowed the scientists to measure delays in the time it took for these to travel through the planet.

The scientists used seismic data detected by sensors around the world shown above after earthquakes

Magma bursting to the surface like in the lava fountain above on Erta Ale, Ethiopia is from only the second layer of the Earth's interior but the planet has a complex structure with a solid metal core at its very centre

Rotating liquid and solid cores at the centre of the Earth create the planets magnetic field, illustrated above

They found that seismic waves that passed through the very centre of the planet showed interference very different from those that travelled through the rest of the core.

They also found that the iron crystals in the inner-most core may also have very different crystal structures, meaning they have different properties.

Professor Song said that it was likely that tectonic changes early in the Earth's history led to these different structures in the core.

He said: 'It may tell us about how our planet formed, its history, and other dynamic processes of the Earth.

'It shapes our understanding of what's going on deep inside the Earth.'
