A daring photographer managed to hold his ground to take these spectacular pictures of an elephant - despite it charging straight towards him.

Incredibly, Ben Cranke sat unfazed in his camp chair as the five-tonne male dashed out of the savannah and stampeded into the water.

The pair came within just 30 feet of each other during a tense stand-off at the Savuti Game Reserve, Chobe National Park, Botswana.

Stand back! Photographer Ben Cranke incurred the displeasure of this elephant at Savuti Game Reserve in Botswana which decided to charge at the 48-year-old to show him who's boss

Too close for comfort: The five-tonne fully-grown male raises its ears into a V position to show it threatening the photographer while splashing water at him

But the 48-year-old from Chingford, Essex, held his nerve as the elephant rushed at him, knowing from experience that the first is usually a mock attack.

The fully-grown animal - which towered 
12 ft high - charged at Mr Cranke three times before concluding he posed
no threat and calmly walked away.

He said: 'It was a blistering hot day and I was sheltering from the heat in the deep shade of a Camelthorn tree, right next to the Savuti channel.

'This elephant walked out of surrounding savannah, down to water's edge on the opposite bank to drink.

'I sat quietly in my camp chair, not moving a muscle, enjoying the experience of being 20 or so metres (65ft) from such a majestic animal.

Making a splash: The elephants marks its territory and gives photographer Ben Cranke a hosing down in a tense stand-off at the reserve in the Chobe National Park

'I had been upwind from him, so remained undetected - but as the breeze shifted, he caught my scent.

'He immediately turned to face me and seeing I was close, he charged without warning straight into the channel in an attempt to scare me off.

'I had suspected he may do this so had quietly adjusted my camera settings to freeze the action of his charge.

'Having spent a lot of time around elephants on foot before, I also thought his charge would be a mock charge, so when he did charge I did not move apart from raising my camera to shoot a burst of frames.

'I must admit to having a few moments of thinking "Have I got it right?", "Is this going to be a mockie?" If I had this wrong I had no chance of escape.'

But after a few tense moments as the fully-grown male elephant charged towards him, it slowed down - eventually stopping just a few metres from where Mr Cranke was sat. 

Lucky escape: Fortunately for Mr Cranke, the charge was just a 'mock attack' and the elephant left him alone when it realised he wasn't a threat

He added: 'Fortunately, he proved me right by stopping short after a few metres of charging into the water.

'He backed off a short distance for a half a minute or so before he charged again, thrashing the water with his trunk and spraying water in my direction.

'I changed my camera from landscape to portrait framing and shot another series of frames, still remaining seating in my camp chair.

'He backed off again, watched for a short while and then charged for the third time - again splashing and spraying water at me.

'This time, he came within 10 metres (30ft) of where I sat quietly, apart from raising my camera.

'After this third charge I suspect the bull realised I was not a threat because he backed off to the opposite edge of the channel.

'He watched me curiously from the bank and splashed himself with some water to cool off.

'He also had a long drink before moving off and disappearing back into the bush from where he had come.

'It was only at this point that I returned to my camp site - in search of a cold beer and with a big smile on my face. What a privileged experience that had been.' 

Quite an ordeal: The pair got within 30ft of each other during the confrontation. After the elephant decided to leave him alone, Mr Cranke returned to his camp site to have a beer and recover from his experience
