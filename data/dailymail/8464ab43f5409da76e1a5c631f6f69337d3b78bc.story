Dick Pound, the hard-hitting former president of the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA), is to head an independent commission investigating allegations of systematic doping and cover-ups in Russia.

Pound will chair the three-man commission and will be joined by fellow Canadian Professor Richard McLaren, a longstanding member of the Court of Arbitration for Sport.

It follows a programme broadcast by German TV station ARD on doping in Russia, which also alleged the IAAF world athletics body had failed to follow up on more than suspicious blood tests from more than 150 athletes including three from Britain.

WADA president Sir Craig Reedie said: 'WADA is pleased that Mr Richard Pound and Professor Richard McLaren have agreed to look into the grave doping allegations that came to light through the recent German television broadcasts.

'The independent commission has the vital task of reviewing the allegations aired during the documentaries, as well as all other information received separately by WADA, to determine if there have been any violations to anti-doping rules.

'Once the investigation is concluded, if it is found that there have been violations or breaches of the rules, WADA will ensure that any individuals or organisations concerned are dealt with in an appropriate fashion under the World Anti-Doping Code.

'The commission will be given the resources it needs in order for the investigation to be carried out thoroughly, and so that, in turn, clean athletes across the world are reassured that the anti-doping system is working in their best interests.'

A third member of the independent commission will be announced by WADA at a later stage.
