There was a moment in the second half when Raheem Sterling lost patience with Andrea Pirlo’s dithering and cheekily dispossessed the Italian great on the edge of his own penalty area.

The England flyer has not time for reputations, not when he is too busy building one all for himself.

It was a fascinating contrast, with Pirlo switching the play at will with those tight balls around the corner and those cute little dummies.

Sterling is old-fashioned, always looking to run with the ball, targeting defenders and trying to exploit their weaknesses.

The England forward, thrust into the No 10 role, didn’t deserve to be on the losing side.

No time for reputations: Raheem Sterling, here dispossessing Italy's Andrea Pirlo, was bold beyond his years

All the tricks: Sterling skips over the challenge of Matteo Darmian in England's 2-1 loss

He played as we knew he would, without inhibition or fear of failure in England’s opening group game at a World Cup in Brazil. Good for him.

It is one of the great shames, then, that this didn’t quite turn out to be his night after Mario Balotelli’s second half winner for Cesare Prandelli’s side.

His killer pass in the 37th minute took out four of the best defenders Italy has to offer at this tournament and ended up in the back of Salavtaore Sirigu’s net. It was a joyous moment.

There was a risk about Roy Hodgson’s decision to pick him from the start, but no-one could ever stand up and be taken seriously again if they said England’s head coach got this wrong.

Hodgson had the backing of the country on this one, even if it meant shifting Rooney to the graveyard shift on the left and Danny Welbeck to the right.

Everybody wants to see this 19-year-old with the ball at his feet because he can pull off moves that vaporise the opposition.

All over the park: Sterling's touches in the World Cup opener against Italy

In the opening minutes he flew past Gabriel Paletta before hitting the side netting with a powerful strike that many inside the stadium believed had gone in. Undeterred he went again.

There was an audacious little first half chip for Danny Welbeck inside the area, the angled run at Andrea Barzagli that threatened to expose Italy’s sluggish defence for pace again.

Before Sterling had time to set up another attack, Italy had wised up to him and sent Daniele de Rossi to keep him company in the middle of the park.

He still had too much for de Rossi when he set up England’s equaliser, peeling off him to collect the ball midway into Italy’s half.

Sterling was razor sharp, demanding the ball from senior players in this England side and trying to make a difference.

When he was in possession he was rampant.

He is an absolute menace to deal with, even when he was sent out to the right after the introduction of Ross Barkley midway through the second half.

Set up: Sterling's piercing pass to Rooney on the left was the catalyst for England's first-half equaliser

There was a clamour for Sterling’s inclusion, most of it based on his electrifying performances during the build up to this tournament.

Hodgson has been monitoring it over the past few weeks and has compared it to the demand for Rooney to play in the opening game of Euro 2004 against France.

Rooney was a kid of 17 them, scoring four times in the group stages before he was injured just 27 minutes into the quarter-final against Portugal.

Here in Manaus the momentum is still with Sterling after a performance of conviction and genuine class.

Tough stuff: Verratti is out-muscled by teenager Sterling in an at-times physical encounter

He plays at speed, running at opponents in a way that we almost thought was lost to the modern game. It is exhilarating to watch.

Sterling carved open Italy’s defence when he sent the ball out to Rooney out on the left in the build up to England’s first half equaliser.

Rooney delivered the sweetest touch from his left boot and soon enough Sturridge was performing that trademark dance in the Arena Amazonia.

In the end it wasn’t enough for England, but the country will see more from Sterling in Sao Paulo on Thursday when they face Uruguay. We have to.

With Sterling in the side, there is still time to get back into this tournament.

3rd Sterling shoots and scores… doesn’t he? The BBC declare ‘goal’, the fans cheer, the pubs celebrate … but his precocious drive from 25 yards swerves away from the goalkeeper’s right hand, but somehow ends up in the side netting. It deserved to be a goal, but that’s not the same. It’s still 0-0. But the Italians now know he is there.

4th Sterling has started centrally and he’s loving the space. But he loses the ball on the edge of the box as he gears up for a run, although it falls kindly for England and Henderson forces a save with a long-range shot. Sterling looks like he is making things happen.

20th As Italy begin to get more possession, England rotate their forwards and Sterling find himself on the left. He tries a dribble but runs in De Rossi and Italy break quickly. Rooney is now inside, trying to get into the game.

21st He creates space, beats the full-back and drives a low, hard cross into the six yard box with his weaker left foot. Danny Welbeck fails to get on the end of it. The BBC studio, including Gary Lineker, Alan Shearer and Thierry Henry must have been groaning. A fox in the box would have scored from that chance and Sterling’s cross deserved a finish.

45th Half time and Sterling is England’s star of the show, according to Thierry Henry and Alan Shearer. Shearer has been campaigning for his inclusion all week. And the teenage Liverpool forward hasn’t let anyone down.

46th Sterling starts the second half in the same care-free fashion, wriggling past two defenders on the left, but now the Italians know he is coming and they muscle him out with reinforcements. He then concedes the ball in centre-field too easily.

51st Sterling shows he is willing to chase after the ball and closes down Pirlo and retrieves the ball, before starting a counter attack, which may have resulted in a penalty after Danny Welbeck is felled. The referee ignores the pleas.

54th Sterling tries to shoot as he appears on the edge of the box, but it’s blocked by Marco Verratti as Italy become familiar with his threat. Verratti, who has been involved in a struggle with Sterling, is then removed to be replaced by the more defensive-minded Thiago Motta.

63rd Now Sterling is on the right… at times it seems like he is everywhere. He does look a menace with the ball and another dribble leads to an throw.

66th Sterling runs at two defenders and wins a corner. He wants the ball, he’s hungry and he’s dangerous. He’s been England’s best player and doesn’t deserve to be on the losing side. Can he conjure an equaliser?

70th Wish a dashing run into space, slicing through three defenders with his body movement and pace, Glen Johnson tries to find him and Italy are forced to concede another corner.

92nd Is shown a yellow card, taking one for the team as he break up an Italy counter-attack.
