A pampered MP complained about chips not being served in the correct fashion at one of the House of Commons restaurants - despite the establishments enjoying £5.8 million a year in taxpayer-funded subsidies.

The astonishing complaint was one of dozens of pedantic moans that have emerged after details from the restaurants' 'suggestions' tray were released.

Others included concern about the size of soup bowls and the fact that beer had hit £2.60 a pint - much lower than in most central London pubs.

Perk: But the plush dining room at the House of Commons, which enjoys splendid views over the Thames, was described as 'dismal' by one MP

Better: One member said chips are better stacked like this so they don't become soggy

An unknown politician wrote:'"The 
bucket" of chips, while attractive to some and no doubt trendy makes for
soggy chips. The tower arrangement is better.'

But he or she went on to praise the restaurants Hoi sin duck spring rolls as being 'consistently delicious'.

Other complaints published in the Daily Telegraph after being released under freedom of information laws, included eggs being too 'watery', change being given in coppers rather than 5p pieces and vending machine crisp packets being 10 grams too light.

One dissatisfied customer claimed eating in the smart wood-panelled House of Commons dining hall which enjoys incredible views over the Thames was a 'dismal experience'.

They moaned that the room was gloomy with no soft lighting to make it more welcoming.

'My starter of beetroot and pumpkin salad consisted of one piece of beetroot in a puddle of pumpkin puree and was tasteless.

Complaint: '"The bucket of chips", while attractive to some and no doubt trendy, makes for soggy chips. The tower arrangement is better'

Cheeky: A member complains about the quality of food in the House of Commons and then demands a discount as an enticement to come back. The redacted complaint was released under freedom of information laws

Row: Politicians have moaned about the layout of chips, the price of beer and the cost of creme eggs

'My main course of fish cake was far too dry to eat and both main courses were too salty.'

Another ingrate accused staff of making them feel like 'second-class citizens' because they had run out of breakfast at 10.30am.

While a dish of kedgeree sparked a furious outburst from one MP who fumed at only receiving three quarter pieces of an egg and not the fourth - describing it as a 'petty and insulting way to save a buck'.

Another major bone of contention was the cost of drinks.

The
cost of a pint of bitter at the Commons Stranger's bar was recently 
raised to £2.60 and a glass of Merlot to £2.35 - still far cheaper than 
the cost at a typical pub.

But
one patron claimed to be 'amazed' at the increase and vowed to switch 
his or her allegiance to the Sports and Social club instead.

Gripes: One politician complained about chips being served in the wrong formation, while the price of drinks was a common bone of contention

While an increase in the cost of Lucozade from 80p to £1.40 was deemed 'frankly stupid'.

MPs enjoy a wide choice of dishes which would not look out of place on the menus of a top restaurant. However thanks to the huge subsidies they come in at a fraction of the cost..

A typical lunch menu - from Thursday, January 12 this year - included artichokes, ratatouille and olives with basil dressing at £2.05, braised pork belly with black pudding bonbon and apple salad at £2.70 and halibut and soft boiled quail egg with carrot dressing at £4.15.

Mains included rib eye steak with hand cut chips and béarnaise sauce for £7.80, haddock and leek fish cake with tomato and dill cream for £6.75 and chickpea and lentil curry with red onion fritter for £6.75.

And for dessert there was a choice of chocolate and orange torte at £2.05, fresh fruit salad at £2.05 or home-made ice creams and sorbets at £2.05.

A selection of fine cheeses and biscuits were also on offer for £3.10.

Last year a plan to cut costs by allowing peers to use the MPs' dining room for lunch was deemed contentious.

Emma Boon, Campaign Director of the TaxPayers’ Alliance, said that MPs should not get subsidised meals at all.

'It’s shocking that MPs are complaining about the dining room in the House of Commons when they get such a good deal,' she said.

'Some of the food on offer is nicer than what many taxpayers can afford to feed themselves and yet it is all subsidised by taxpayers.

'No one expects MPs to eat gruel but instead of lodging petty complaints they should count themselves lucky they aren’t paying full price. It’s high time these subsidies were ended.'
