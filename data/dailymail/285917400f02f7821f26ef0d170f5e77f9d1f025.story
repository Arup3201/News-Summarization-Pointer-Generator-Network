Yesterday, a study revealed online daters are more likely to end up in a happy marriage than those who meet randomly.

I agree with the psychologists’ view that it’s because there’s a higher motivation to find love among internet daters.

There’s a lot that’s right about online dating. It’s time efficient - simply go online in the comfort of your own home and view hundreds of potential partners on any number of dating websites catering for every possible taste. And it’s convenient - you can narrow the search for a partner by listing what you will and won’t put up with.

But the biggest advantage of online dating is also the biggest disadvantage. On the upside, it means the people you meet are likely to be more compatible with you than some random guy you meet in a bar who you know nothing about.

Why will you never meet the perfect man online? Because there's no such thing, says Tracey Cox - and if you really believe there is, you're heading for disappointment

On the downside, it feeds into our already rampant expectations that there is indeed a perfect person out there who will tick all our boxes. Online dating is like making a shopping list. You’re effectively making a list of all the characteristics and features that make up your idea of the perfect person: hair colour, height, income, likes, dislikes.

And the trouble with clicking all those boxes online is that we start to think there’s someone out there who will actually have all those things.

So when you do meet up with someone and quite like them, there’s a little voice in your head saying, 'This guy’s nice but he’s not perfect. Maybe the next guy I meet will tick all the boxes'.

So you have one more online date and he’s not completely without fault either, so you try another and another… and let me save you a whole lot of bother by telling you this straight up: there is no perfect person out there for you because there’s no perfect person out there for anyone. They don’t exist.

Tracey Cox: 'We’re human. We have flaws. Believing in Mr Perfect is about as silly as believing Christian Grey really does exist'

Even if you end up falling head over heels for someone and they do seem perfect at the time, when the love hormones wear off, there will be one or two areas where he won’t be flawless. It’s called real life. We’re human. We have flaws and imperfections. Believing in Mr Perfect is about as silly as believing Christian Grey really does exist.

The other thing I can tell you is the
 person you’ll end up falling for will probably look and be nothing like
 what you’re imagining right now. And this is the other great failing of
 online dating: it discounts one very important, extremely powerful 
variable - chemistry.

Chemistry
 is what’s responsible when you meet some guy who is totally not your 
physical type and the complete opposite in personality to guys you 
normally get on with - but you don’t care. It’s illogical, irrational 
and out of our conscious control because it works on a primitive level 
based largely on whether your body wants to get close to theirs (which 
is why you don’t know if you’ve got it until you meet in person).

The
 list goes out the window when chemistry walks into our lives and so it 
should. Chemistry alone won’t guarantee you a great relationship but if 
you have it, you’re streets ahead of the couple who don’t.

By
 all means date online - it’s a highly effective and successful way to 
meet a partner. Just be aware that the more specific you are and the 
more boxes you tick, the fewer men you’re going to meet in person.

The
 more closed you are about the ‘type’ you’re prepared to meet, the less 
likely you are to meet someone who really is perfect for you but just 
happens to be one year younger and half an inch shorter than the box you
 ticked.
