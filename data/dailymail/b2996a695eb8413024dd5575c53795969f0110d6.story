A cruel husband told his elderly wife 'prepare to meet your maker' before violently attacking her after she helped their son with his divorce.

Ronald Needham, 86, tried to throttle his wife Sheila, 80, after he discovered she's helped their married son divorce his wife.

Needham punched, slapped and even bit his wife of 61 years as she lay in bed during his 'cold and calculated' attack, a court was told.

The violent, two-hour struggle occurred in the couple's Merseyside home in September last year.

Ronald Needham, 86, beat his wife Sheila until she was 'black and blue' during a two-hour attack at the couple's Norris Green, Merseyside home (area pictured)

The attack only came to an end after Needham 'ran out of energy' and his terrified wife, who had been beaten 'black and blue', managed to fend him off with a drawer.

Liverpool Crown Court heard to the outside world the former soldier and Post Office worker seemed to 'a normal family man'.

But in a victim impact statement Mrs Needham said 'at home he was a monster.'

She said the man had been violent to her throughout their marriage - but she had never confessed to police.

Needham denied attempted murder but admitted causing grievous bodily harm with intent.

Jailing Needham for five years with an extended sentence of two years, Judge Mark Brown described the attack as 'ferocious' and ruled that he poses a significant risk of serious harm to his wife.

Judge Brown said: 'This was a sustained attack over a couple of hours 
involving strangulation, punches, slaps, biting and effectively the use 
of your teeth as a weapon.

'I
 am satisfied you intended to inflict grievous bodily harm on her and it
 is very fortunate that she was not more seriously hurt.’

He
 added that Needham’s wife, 'is very fearful that when you are released 
you will seek revenge. She is terrified of you and very concerned about 
the future.'

'You have very limited remorse and no insight into the impact of your offending and the gravity of your conduct.'

He also imposed a restraining order to keep away from Sheila who has started divorce proceedings.

Mrs Needham told the court her husband will come after her following his release, stating: 'He will never let me go.'

She added: 'I wish I had listened to his mother all those years ago. The only good things to come out of it is our sons Peter and Nigel.'

Mrs Needham told the court she thought her husband would 'never let her go' and he would pursue her after he was released from prison. The former soldier was handed a 5-year sentence and a restraining order

Henry Riding, prosecuting, told the court how the attack took place at their home in Norris Green, Merseyside  on September 25 last year - the day after the couple's son Nigel came round to their home with his laundry.

They began rowing before the son was forced to restrain his violent father.

The man then told his father if he retaliated by taking things out on his mother he would 'floor' him, the court was told.

Needham then told his wife: 'Don’t worry about me hitting you, I won’t, I’ll bide my time. I have plans for you.'

At about 4am, Needham came into her bedroom, 'put her bedside light on and told her, "prepare to meet your maker"' while wearing a sly grin on his face, jurors heard.

'She was still half asleep and he got on top of her and started to strangle her with his hands around her throat,' said Mr Riding.

The court was told how, although not good on her legs, Mrs Needham's was able to raise her legs up and put them on his chest to push him off.

While she was kicking out at him he was telling her 'I’ll have you'. He was trying to punch her and she grabbed a drawer from the dressing table and began hitting him with it, the court was told.

Jurors heard how Mrs Needham was screaming out hoping a neighbour would hear - but realised she would not as she took her hearing aids out at night. She therefore started talking rubbish in a bid to calm him down.

Fortunately he became wedged under the dressing table which restricted his movements and 'his energy sapped and he gave up,' the court was told

He then told her 'It’s over now, you have ruined my life. That is it now, I’ll be in there with druggies and what not'.

Needham then rang the emergency services who arrived to find the blood stained room in disarray.

Mrs Needham, now 81, suffered a bite to her right calf and toe and contusions and bruising to her face and body.

'She was black and blue and aching all over. Photographs showed injuries to an old lady who has been battered,' said Mr Riding.

She had to be referred to an opthalmic surgeon because of a cut to her eye and the bite to her leg become infected and was still being treated for it in January this year.

She described that as a 'daily reminder' of her ordeal and still has trouble sleeping fearing he might return even though she knew he was in custody.

When interviewed by police, Needham claimed that the she had hurled a torrent of abuse at him and he defended himself. However, the court heard he no longer maintains his version of events.

Peter Killen, defending, said that Needham suffers from epilepsy and is in poor health. He has been suffering from episodes of confusion and paranoia and is struggling in prison.
