Twenty pro-Russian 'terrorists' have been shot dead after they clashed with Ukrainian soldiers in the port city of Mariupol.

Fighting broke out at the area's police headquarters and interior ministry when local forces tried to reclaim buildings which were seized last night.

Five policemen are said to have been wounded in the stand off while four separatists were captured.

Ukraine's interior minister Minister 
Arsen Avakov said the attempt by 'terrorists' to storm the building 
turned into a pitched battle within its walls.

Some rebels had fled and were seeking shelter in the town.

A local photographer at the scene told Reuters the building was ablaze and that at least two bodies were lying in the street outside.

'One of them is definitely a police officer,' he said.

Other reports said the headquarters was left ridden with bullet holes after the vicious gun battle broke out.

A
 parade marking the Soviet Union's victory over the Nazis in 1945 was 
taking place in the city at the time, but participants were re-directed 
and joined the violence.

Smoke was seen rising from the city as residents described the 'deadly clashes' on social media.

The fire started after Ukrainian forces and pro-Russian milita pitched a battle inside the building

Ukrainian forces had brought
 several armoured cars into the town, a major industrial and shipping 
centre with a population of around 500,000.

The
 Interfax agency said police were trying to wrest back control of the 
buildings when they came under came under fire from pro-Russia militia.

Tanks
 were seen patrolling the streets as brawls broke out around the city, 
days after 30 pro-Russia insurgents were killed in Slovyansk. 

Local police in the eastern Donetsk region, centre of a pro-Russian rebellion against Kiev, said they could not comment.

Mariupol, in the heart of a 
self-declared 'People's Republic' declared by local pro-Russian rebels, 
has been the focus of days of skirmishing between Ukrainian police and 
separatist gunmen.

The violence cams as President Vladimir Putin flew to Crimea to mark Russia's Second World War Commemorations.

It
 is the first time he has been to the region since it was annexed in 
March and is a visit that is likely to anger the Ukrainian leadership and 
upset the West.

Around 11,000 troops marched through Moscow's Red Square to celebrate Victory Day, marking the Soviet Union's defeat of Hitler.

Vladimir Putin told the mass of soldiers: 'This is a holiday when all-conquering 
patriotic force triumphs, when we all feel especially strongly what it 
means to be true to the Motherland and how important it is to be able to
 stand up for its interests.'

Force: Residents captured tanks patrolling the streets. Ukrainian forces are said to have stepped up the presence of armoured vehicles in a bid to retrieve seized buildings
