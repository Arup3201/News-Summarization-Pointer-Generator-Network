Italy coach Cesare Prandelli has signed a two-year contract extension that will keep him in charge of the Azzurri up until after the 2016 European Championship.

Prandelli and the federation had already verbally agreed on the extension two months ago. His previous contract was set to expire after the upcoming World Cup in Brazil.

Prandelli left Fiorentina to take charge of the Azzurri in 2010 and transformed Italy from a side that was eliminated in the first round of the World Cup to Euro 2012 runner-up.

Wanted: The Italian FA were keen to keep Cesare Prandelli on in role as national team manager

 

He has been praised for his approach that has promoted youth and team unity.

Prandelli's Italy squad is unique in that it is the only squad that doesn't have a single player from the Premier League although they do have former Manchester City striker Mario Balotelli amongst their ranks.

Italy have been drawn into Group D for the upcoming World Cup along with England, Uruguay and Costa Rica. They open their campaign against England on Saturday June 14.
