Alex Bruce has defended his dad Steve over the touchline bust-up with Gus Poyet – a spat which could yet land the two managers in trouble with the Football Association.

The FA were last night going through referee Mike Dean's report of the unsavoury incident - which came during Tuesday's 1-1 draw between Hull and Sunderland at the KC Stadium – and could decide to bring charges against the pair.

Poyet protested at Dean's decision to book Jack Rodwell for diving by kicking over a drinks carrier.

He was sent to the stands by Dean before sarcastically applauding in Bruce's face and directing a comment which the Tigers boss later said was 'not very pleasant'.

That provoked a reaction from Bruce, who had to be restrained by the assistant referee as he attempted to get at the Uruguayan.

Bruce Jnr was the defender who challenged Rodwell before the dive which sparked the clash, and he said: 'I didn't touch him. If that's what Gus was unhappy about then he was wrong, because I didn't touch him. He was just too quick for me.'

Bruce has also attempted to play down the subsequent confrontation between his dad and Poyet.

'It was just handbags,' he said. 'In games like that there's always going to be a bit of a hoo-ha. It was a big game that everyone wants to win.

'Temperatures were high and I'm sure all the supporters enjoyed it.'

Meanwhile, Bruce has accused Rodwell of using his arm to score Sunderland's late equaliser.

'I saw it. I was claiming for it when he put it in,' he said. 'To be honest, I thought it was going in anyway. He didn't need to touch it but he definitely put it in with his arm as it went in.

'We can't be too down about it. At least we weren't been beaten, that's the main thing, and that point could yet be crucial.' 

 The incident during Hull's 1-1 draw with Sunderland could see both men punished by the FA

 Alex Bruce has since attempted to play down the row between his father and Poyet

The 1-1 draw leaves both sides still fighting for their Premier League survival this season

Hull are 15th in the table with 27 points while Sunderland are just one point behind them in 16th

 The pressures of a relegation battle are stressful for any manager and Bruce is no exception
