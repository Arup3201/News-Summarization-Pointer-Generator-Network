Senator John McCain sacrificed the dream of a White Christmas for a far greater cause this holiday season as he flew to Kabul to spend time with American troops serving overseas.

The war hero's appearance comes just days before American and NATO combat troops will withdraw from Afghanistan after 13 years in the country.

This as local forces in the country will now be tasked with protecting the security vacuum left in the wake of America's withdrawal from the increasingly daunting and emboldened threats of Islamic militants.

Senator McCain also took time to meet with some of the country's leaders during his trip, including president Ashraf Ghani and his chief executive officer Abdullah Abdullah.

President Ghani and Senator McCain also both took time to praise the service of the brave men and women who helped the country over the past 13 years, with Ghani praising them for their incredible sacrifices while McCain emphasized America's long-term support for the country, according to a statement released by the presidency.

The reason for the season: Even Santa stopped by to see the troops

And while many of the male, and a few of the female, troops were no doubt incredibly moved by the words of these leaders and nostalgic about their tour coming to an end, it would seem that for many the highlight of the holiday was a few sexy Santa dancers who entertained the troops in revealing red dresses that seemed to do wonders for morale.
