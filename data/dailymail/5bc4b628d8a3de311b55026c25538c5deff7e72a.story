A woman whose sister and best friend were brutally murdered by her ex-boyfriend says she still has nightmares about the day of the attack.

Elisa Frank, who has now written a book about her experiences, was 19 when Ahmad Otak stabbed her sister Kimberley in the side while pretending to leave her Wakefield flat.

Otak, then 21, went on to stab the 17-year-old another 14 times before licking the bloody knife in his hand and spitting on her body.

But her ordeal still wasn't over. Otak, an Afghan asylum seeker, then tied Miss Frank up using an electrical flex and forced her to summon best friend Samantha Sykes, 18, to the flat.

When Miss Sykes arrived, the crazed killer stabbed her 34 times before slitting her throat - all in front of a distraught Miss Frank. 

Otak then attempted to flee to France in Miss Frank's car but was foiled by a fellow refugee who raised the alarm.

A year later, the 'sadistic' and 'inadequate' killer was jailed for life with a minimum 34-year term by a judge at Leeds Crown Court.

Miss Frank, now 21, was in court to hear Otak jailed but says despite the lengthy sentence, she will never get over the death of her sister and best friend.

'I still have nightmares every single night,' she says. 'It started out being about the event, then sometimes I'd see Kim as a ghost.

'I try not to think about it during the day. If I do, it's too overwhelming.'

Miss Frank had been in a relationship with Otak, who arrived in the UK in 2007, off and on for several years and at one point, the couple had planned to marry.

She had been living in a children's home with her sister, with the girls placed in care aged 13 and 14, after their mother decided she was unable to cope.

The girls were still in care when Miss Frank met Otak and struck up a relationship, although she soon tired of his violent and controlling behaviour.

Nevertheless, the relationship continued until September 2012 when Miss Frank finally decided that she had had enough and ended it.

Memories: Elisa has gone on to write a book, while Otak (right) will remain in prison for the rest of his life

Tragically, her decision was to have appalling consequences and Miss Frank says she still feels guilty about allowing Otak into her life.

But despite the nightmares, she hopes to keep her sister and best friend's memory alive and has written a book, The Borderline Diaries, which charts the murder and her recovery over the days and weeks that followed. 

'If I didn't have writing to focus on I would be lost,' she admits. 'It's all I do, it's something I use to get through.'

Following the murders, Miss Frank spent months in hospital and was diagnosed with post-traumatic stress disorder and borderline personality disorder, the latter giving her book its title.

She describes the account, which runs to 53,000 words, as creative non-fiction rather than autobiography, but admitted the prospect of having her story made public was scary.

'Me and my sister used to write a lot,' she explains. 'We used to talk about getting published, so I feel like this is for her. When you write about someone, it keeps their memory alive.'

'Two girls have been murdered in Barden Road, stabbed to death, and I was there when it happened.

I was there and I survived it. I don't know why. Maybe you think I am not making sense, maybe that's why you're not responding to me.

I am aware I don't make sense. Just come back please. Come back and I'll make it all better and for once in my life I will help someone else, you and Sammy.

I need you here and I'll wrap Band Aids around your wounds, for they should have been mine. I know I have not been there for you over this past year. 

I know I have failed you as a sister and a best friend. I'm sorry for all those times you came round to the house of horrors and I didn't answer.

I pretended there was nobody in. I know there's no excuse but he wouldn't let me answer to you, he was always jealous of you, he knew how much you meant to me and that Sammy was the only friend I have ever had.

I'll write again soon and I won't stop writing until you are returned to me. Promise me one thing? 

One day you will come back to me, but don't wait too long. I love you forever and always. Me and you twins for life, right? Distance never kept us apart before.'
