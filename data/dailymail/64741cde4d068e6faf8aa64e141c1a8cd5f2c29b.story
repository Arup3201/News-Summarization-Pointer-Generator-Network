Looking across the rows of tents and the high-wire fence, you could be forgiven for thinking you are looking over a prisoner of war camp or a refugee settlement awaiting an influx of people from a conflict zone.

But, complete with armed guards and untidy surroundings this is the scene that greeted hundreds of England football fans as they arrived in Donetsk, Ukraine, ahead of England's opening Euro 2012 group game on Monday.

The lines of white tents where fans who have been priced out of the town's hotels are staying are in stark contrast to the England team's luxury hotel in the centre of the Polish capital, Krakow.

No, it's not a refugee camp, it's an English fan compound in Donetsk, Ukraine

Welcoming? One of the signs greeting people as they arrive at the camp says: 'It was cool being with you guys! Come back soon!'

It's hardly a Roman piazza, but at least if you get into the VIP section you get some shade from the sun in one of the open squares

    Polish fans who staged running battles with their Russian counterparts before and after the two teams met have warned England fans that they are next.

They have told English supporters to expect worse than the violence seen on the streets of Warsaw on Tuesday.

Police said that of the 184 arrested following the violence, 156 were Polish.

Last night warnings posted on the internet suggested that the thugs now had English supporters in their sights, apparently in revenge for the way their countrymen living in the UK are treated.

One supporter revealed how a Polish football fan he met ont he plane told him how they would be targeted, according to the Daily Star.

He said: 'The guy said many of the ultra groups in Poland were planning to join together and attack English supporters in retaliation over how Poles are treated in the UK.'

On Tuesday it took more than 5,000 riot police armed with water cannon, tear gas and rubber bullets to quell the violence which started as more than 5,000 fans marched through the Polish capital to mark Russia Day.

it was seen as a provocative gesture by Poles who were ruled for decades from Moscow under the old Soviet rule.

At £100 a night for a three-man 
berth, the price is a little steep, but still cheaper than the hotels in
the centre of Donetsk, home of the stadium where England drew 1-1 with France on Monday night.

The 
campsite, with capacity for 1,000 people, is manned by a military guard who is less welcoming than the 
entrance sign that reads 'It was cool being with you guys! Come back 
soon!'.

Despite the 
security presence, however, it hardly takes the Great Escape wherewithal
of RAF Squadron Leader Roger Bushell to figure out who to get past the 
mesh barrier.

One fan told the Guardian: 'It's not hard to get over that fence if you fancy a rob.'

At
the centre of the camp there is an unshaded square (unless you go for a
VIP tent, then you're provided at least with some rest from the sun).

It's
hardly a Roman piazza or a French carré, but it serves its purpose, 
namely it's somewhere to sit together, shirtless, eating from fast food 
stalls, and drinking from beer tents dotted around the camp.

It may be surprising, but there are actually three categories of accommodation from the basic to the 'luxury'.

The basic one is a tent. For those wanting a more relaxing place to sleep a sleeping bag will be provided.

But
for those feeling flush and really wanting to get a good night's sleep 
there is a tent in which you can stand up - at full height - with actual
beds, which actually look more like gazebos you might put up in your back garden.

It was a bit of a last-minute dash to build the final 150 of 250 tents on the site, but the job was done and it was home to 1,000 fans

Donetsk was actually founded by Welsh businessman, John Hughes, who started up a steel plant and several coal mines.

The city has a population of nearly 1million people and the main industry is still based on coal mining.

For
anyone wanting to do anything other than watch the football there is a 
boulevard that stretches 1.24miles with cafes, fountains and an 
interesting array of statues.

There is also the Donbass Palace, now a five-star hotel, and Donetsk Opera and Ballet Theatre.

The
main tourist street, however, is First Line Avenue which has hotels, 
parks, shops and restaurants, all housed in varying architecture.

There is also a nod to the town's founder -  monument in front of the Donetsk National Technical University.

Included in the cost is the washing of linen, showers, toilets, and electricity for people to charge their mobile phones.

Another
fan added before England's first game: 'It's about what we expected. We
heard the stories but there weren't any hotels at all in Donetsk, they 
just all went. That's why we're here. It could be better for sure. I 
have no idea how we're going to get into town.'

But those who have made it out this far would appear to be among the few - as the opening game against France was played out against a backdrop of a stadium that appeared at least a quarter empty.

It is thought that the cost of travel and accommodation, and security fears kept many away. And the sight of this camp, and Tuesday's violence between Polish and Russian fans, the fears would seem to have been realised.

The problem has been so marked that tickets for England's final group game against the hosts that originally went on sale for £40 are being sold for £14.

Just 4,000 of the allocation of 9,000 tickets for England fans have been taken up, which will result in the poorest attendance at any major championship for years. Russian fans will outnumber their English equivalents in the stadium for the match against Ukraine.

Fans' accommodation is quite different to Hotel Stary in Krakow where England's players are staying

England's next game is tomorrow night
in Kiev against Sweden, knowing that a win will go a long way to 
helping them secure a quarter-final place.

Those remaining in Donetsk, hoping that England will be 
playing there again in the quarter-finals, will have to content 
themselves with watching the game on TV.

Some who remained back in England, 
however, are not being allowed to watch the game after being told they 
had to work through it - despite being a 7.45 kick-off.

In fact, bosses at one of the national team's mains sponsors have provoked anger by banning staff from watching England's games.

Vauxhall factory workers were banned 
from watching Monday's draw with France and have been told that they 
cannot see tomorrow evening's game against Sweden because it would 
'breach health and safety regulations'.

One worker at the company's Luton 
plant told The Sun: 'Our company is the main sponsor for England yet 
when it comes to matches we aren't even allowed to watch. We're gutted.'

Russia have the threat of a six-point deduction hanging over them during qualification for the next European Championship in France in 2016.

UEFA handed out the punishment for the violence inside Wroclaw’s stadium during and after last Friday’s game against the Czech Republic. They also fined Russia £96,000. The hosts of the World Cup finals in 2018 say they will appeal.

The punishment does not relate to the violence between Russian and Polish fans in Warsaw on Tuesday, but last night UEFA said they would investigate that trouble. If found guilty over the fan violence that led to 24 injuries and more than 180 arrests, Russia could find the suspended six-point deduction imposed immediately.

Russian FA president Sergey Fursenko said: ‘We want to submit an appeal against the punishment given. It is a shame that the team answers for the ill-considered actions and words of the fans.’

FA’s honorary president Vyacheslav Koloskov added: ‘Six points is complete nonsense. I think this decision is aimed at discrediting Russian football in general.’
