MPs have demanded 'compulsory training' for mobility scooter drivers after a shock figures revealed three people a WEEK are being injured in accidents involving the 10mph disability buggies.

In total, 164 accidents involving mobility scooters were recorded last year – including five drivers who were killed, 17 who suffered serious injuries and a further 102 who sustained 'slight injuries'.

Nine more people, who were not the driver, were seriously injured after being hit by a scooter - and another 31 people slightly injured, the Department for Transport has revealed.

Mobility scooters are classified as medical devices and are not covered by the Road Traffic Act

But experts said the true figure is likely to be far higher, because the crashes were only recorded by less than half of police forces.

The vehicles, intended for disabled people and have a top speed of just 10mph, are cheap to run, do not need tax or insurance, and can be driven without a licence.

They are classified as medical devices and are not covered by the Road Traffic Act, giving the police limited powers to prosecute dangerous driving.

Alison Seabeck, MP for Plymouth Moor View, has spoken out over the growing menace caused by some drivers and accused the Government of not taking the dangers seriously.

The Labour MP has written to Transport Minister Robert Goodwill to express her concern at the danger posed by the growing number of mobility scooters.

More than 300,000 people are now thought to use mobility scooters in the UK.

Transport Secretary Patrick McLoughlin is under pressure to introduce 'compulsory training' for mobility scooter drivers

Ms Seabeck says an ageing population will fuel the growth of scooters, and wants more stringent checks in place.

She has also previously raised concern over able-bodied youngsters using mobility scooters as a cheap alternative to running a car.

She told Commons in 2012 how she spotted one youngster spotted 'cruising along the seafront at a Devon resort' with his golf clubs on the back.

But Ms Seabeck is convinced accidents are on the increase.

She told the Western Morning News: 'With more and more mobility vehicles on the roads, the lack of knowledge amongst some users regarding safety and visibility, and in some cases poor roadworthiness, are all potential causes of accidents leading to injury and death.

'If the growth in numbers continues at the current rate then the Government must take action. The public seem to agree.

'We need to know who is using these vehicles and training on purchase, whether privately or from a shop, should become a mandatory requirement.'
