House Majority Leader Eric Cantor refused Wednesday to explain how he lost his seat in Congress a day earlier, telling reporters in Washington, D.C. that he would 'leave the political analysis to y'all.'

He flatly refused to navel-gaze about whether his stance on illegal immigration signaled the end of his political career, or to speculate on whether he had drifted too far away from his conservative base and joined the dreaded 'Republican establishment.'

Responding to a question about the conservative-moderate divide plaguing the GOP, he would say only that 'what divides Republicans pales in comparison to what divides us conservatives from the left.'

Cantor, who lost his Republican primary Tuesday night in a result that left the Republican Party shell-shocked, said just 18 hours later that he would step down as House Majority Leader on July 31.

Crushed: Eric Cantor lost a 56-44 decision to economics professor Dave Brat on Tuesday and won't be back in Congress next January

Cantor, a seven-term Virginia congressman, said he had no regrets about his time in Washington, but refused to speculate about why he had lost in historic fashion  

That will leave enough time for the House Republican caucus to choose a successor before the November election season heats up.

He endorsed Majority Whip Kevin McCarthy for the job. McCarthy, a Californian serving in his fourth term, is currently the majority whip, the official in charge of 'whipping' votes and maintaining party discipline.

'I will be backing him with my full support,' Cantor announced.

Despite widespread beliefs that his willingness to embrace some reforms to the U.S. immigration system ultimately cost him the primary election, Cantor said his views haven't changed.

'I have always said the system is broken.
 It needs reforms ... one step at a time,' he said.

He was particularly rankled by the cases of so-called "DREAMers," illegal immigrants who were brought to the United States as children.

'I would like to see the issues of the kids addressed,' he said.

But the Virginian drew a sharp line between his position and the White House's: 'I don't believe in this my way or the highway approach that the president has laid out.'

Dave Brat, a political unknown who teaches economics at Randolph-Macon College in Virginia, took 56 per cent of the vote on Tuesday, driven by Virginians' fears that increased immigration would choke off jobs and lower wages.

Brat persuaded voters that Cantor, despite his preference for a limited slice of immigration reform options, backed a Barack Obama-style 'amnesty' program that would give 11 million illegal immigrants a path to U.S. citizenship.

Cantor said he had no regrets about his seven terms in Congress.

'We House Republicans have made some tremendous strides over the past few years,' he said, citing his party's advocacy for school vouchers, medical research, budget cuts and 'protecting the elderly' from Obamacare.

'We forced the reduction of spending in Washington in consecutive years for the first time since the Korean War,' he said.

Pressed on his sudden lack of tea party credentials – points that swung to Brat on Tuesday – Cantor admonished the press not to misunderstand the movement's purpose.

'Remember what TEA party stands for: Taxed Enough Already,' he said. 'All of us conservative Republicans believe in that.'

'Conservatives have solutions that can help alleviate the middle-class squeeze and provide opportunity for all.'

He also slammed Senate Democrats for allowing 'a stack of bills' to accumulate – legislation already passed in the House – despite their habit of referring to House Republicans as a 'do-nothing' caucus.

Cantor also pushed back against claims that he had spent more time hobnobbing with donors and working with lobbyists, as part of his leadership role, than working on his constituents' needs.

'I was in my district every week,' he insisted.

'There's a balance. ... Never was there a day when I did not put the citizens of the 7th District of Virginia first.'
