Manchester United's Adnan Januzaj has had his first cap for Belgium taken away after FIFA wiped last month's 5-1 win over Luxembourg from the official records.

Coach Marc Wilmots made seven substitutions during the May 26 World Cup warm-up in Genk - one more than the quota permitted by world football's governing body.

The decision means that Chelsea striker Romelu Lukaku's hat-trick in the match has been erased, while back-up goalkeeper Sammy Bossut also loses his first cap.

Mistake: Marc Wilmots made seven substitutions during the friendly in Genk - one more than FIFA permit

Wilmots made five changes at half-time, a sixth in the 61st minute and another one in the 77th minute when Tottenham defender Jan Vertonghen was replaced by Nicolas Lombaerts.

The result will not count towards the FIFA rankings, which are set to be updated on Friday ahead of the finals in Brazil. Belgium are currently 12th.

Stripped: Romelu Lukaku scored a hat-trick in the friendly but those three goals will not count towards his international tally

Brussels-born Januzaj, 19, who enjoyed an impressive breakthrough season with United, opted to play for Belgium ahead of Albania, Kosovo, Turkey, Serbia and England.

Tottenham winger Nacer Chadli and former Chelsea midfielder Kevin De Bruyne were also on target in the easy win over neighbours Luxembourg.Their goals will also be expunged.

Januzaj will be in the Belgian squad as they take on Algeria, Russia and South Korea in Group H at the World Cup.
