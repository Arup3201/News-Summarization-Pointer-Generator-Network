Hundreds of MPs – including Ed Miliband – have together claimed a total of £200,000 on expenses to pay their energy bills.

Politicians have claimed up to £6,000 each for gas and electricity in their second homes, leaving hard-pressed taxpayers to pick up the bill.

Some 340 MPs, some of them multi-millionaires, have taken advantage of the perk at a time when many people are struggling to pay rising utility bills.

Even Labour leader Mr Miliband, who has attacked the Government over spiralling costs, claimed £403.59 for fuel at his constituency home in Doncaster.

Claims: Ed Miliband, who has attacked the Government over spiralling costs, claimed £403.59 for fuel at his constituency home, while Nick Clegg claimed £254.29 for gas and electricity

Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg claimed £254.29 for electricity and gas in his Sheffield constituency home, but David Cameron and George Osborne did not take advantage of the privilege.

The highest claimer was Tory MP Nadhim Zahawi, who charged the public £5,822.27 for power at his £1million constituency home in the year to March.

Eight of the top ten claims are from Tory MPs. Northern Ireland minister Andrew Robathan claimed £4,586, international development minister Alan Duncan claimed £3,998.06 and education minister Liz Truss claimed £2,579.67.

Former Labour ministers Peter Hain and 
Dame Margaret Beckett were both in the top five, with bills of £4,571 
and £3,960 respectively.

The revelation brings back memories of the 2009 expenses scandal when MPs and peers were revealed to have exploited parliamentary allowances to subsidise their lifestyles in multiple homes.

Mr Duncan, who was shadow Leader of the House during the 2009 scandal, was demoted by David Cameron after he was secretly filmed saying MPs were being made to live ‘on rations’ and had been treated ‘like ****’.

All the claims are within parliamentary rules, which allow MPs to claim up to £20,100 in expenses for second homes – having been granted a £100 rise in April.

But they come at a time of heightened tensions over rising fuel bills. The average dual fuel bill is set to hit £1,400 this winter as four of the Big Six energy firms – British Gas, nPower, Scottish Power and SSE – introduce inflation-busting price hikes of an average of 9.1 per cent.

Bills of more than £1,000 were submitted by 41 MPs, while another 78 made claims for at least £500 for their second homes. Some 310 MPs did not claim anything.

Shadow transport minister Mary Creagh claimed £2,182, while culture secretary Maria Miller asked for £2,011.

Stratford-upon-Avon MP Mr Zahawi, who founded the polling firm YouGov, is seen as a rising Tory star and sits on David Cameron’s policy board. He and his wife Lana run a riding school and their second home is set in 31 acres. They also have a £5million London home.

The bills were revealed in documents filed to the Independent Parliamentary Standards Authority between April 2012 and March 2013. MPs claimed £23million in personal expenses over this period. Under new rules since 2010, MPs are allowed to make claims on their second homes for gas and electricity, as well as rent, hotel stays, council tax, service charges and their phone and internet. But campaigners said constituents would feel outraged that well-off MPs were claiming for their fuel bills when voters are struggling.

Labour MP John Mann, who has not submitted any claims, said: ‘There will be people including pensioners who can’t afford to heat their homes who will be furious to find out that MPs who can afford to pay them are putting in such high claims.’

Referring to a remark made recently by a Number 10 aide, he added: ‘Perhaps the MPs who have submitted claims should start wearing thicker jumpers.’

Neil Jordan-Duncan of the National Pensioners Convention said: ‘Pensioners will be disgusted at how out of touch many MPs are, when many older people have to choose between heating and eating.’

And Clare Welton of the campaign group Fuel Poverty Action said: ‘It is little wonder that many MPs have done nothing to tackle fuel poverty in this country when they are immune from the price hikes by the profit-hungry Big Six energy companies.’ 

Mr Miliband’s spokesman said he had made ‘a legitimate claim’.
