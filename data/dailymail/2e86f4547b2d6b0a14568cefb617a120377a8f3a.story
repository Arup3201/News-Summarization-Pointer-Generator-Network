A prison guard is accused of hiding bags of weed inside hollowed out sandwiches and trying to smuggle them into prison.

Jason Marek, 29,  a correctional officer who went by the nickname 'Murder', worked at Chicago's Cook County Jail.

He was stopped by jail personnel as he reported to work in June 2013 carrying a plastic shopping bag.

Inside the bag authorities found two Jim Shoe sandwiches that had been crammed with bags of marijuana, as well as a carton of menthol cigarettes, according to the charges.

He was allegedly carrying 'Jim Shoe' sandwiches -a classic Chicago sub stuffed with corned beef, Italian beef and gyro meat - but hollowed out so that baggies of marijuana could be hidden inside, reports MyFox Chicago.

It was reported there were 18 bags of weed in one sandwich

The corrections officer was arrested on Tuesday and faces a federal criminal charge, federal authorities said.

Three inmates, two civilian women and a police dispatcher have also been charged by the U.S. Department of Justice in the case.

In June 2013, the inmates and their two women friends allegedly bribed Marek to smuggle three ounces of pot, along with tobacco, alcohol and other contraband, into the jail, the U.S. Attorney for the Northern District of Illinois said in a statement.

He took a $200 bribe to make the delivery, it's alleged.

Marek packed the marijuana inside two sandwiches and the inmates planned to sell it inside the jail, where it can fetch up to five times its street price, the statement said.

According to the FBI, Marek attempted to deliver the marijuana to three inmates but was intercepted by the FBI and the Sheriff's Department's Office of Professional Responsibility as he entered the jail. 

Marek was arrested on Tuesday and released on his own recognizance.

The two women and the police dispatcher were also charged and released. 

The three inmates who face charges remain in state custody, the statement said.

The police dispatcher was charged with one count of illegally accessing a law-enforcement computer. 

The other six were charged with conspiracy to possess with intent to distribute marijuana.

The defendants face maximum penalties of five years in prison and a $250,000 fine, the U.S. Attorney's statement said.
