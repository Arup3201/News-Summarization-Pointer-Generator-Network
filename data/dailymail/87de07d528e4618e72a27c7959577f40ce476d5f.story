Amid the fanfare that always accompanies the arrival of Mr Usain St Leo Bolt on to an athletics track, it was easy to overlook the fact that the Jamaican and his band of merry men were not, for once, the quickest in the men’s 4x100 metre relay heats.

They won their heat ahead of Nigeria with Bolt on the anchor leg, but that honour fell to England, who managed to get the baton round a full 21 hundredths of a second quicker than Jamaica.

England’s time of 38.78sec will mean little when it comes to today’s final, of course, but then Bolt’s long overdue appearance at Hampden Park has always felt more about significance than substance. He came, cavorted and the crowd loved him for it. That was the main thing.

Jamaica 
could afford to leave out 100m and 200m champions Kemar Bailey-Cole and 
Rasheed Dwyer, see Kimmari Roach suffer an injury halfway round the 
first leg and still allow Bolt a casual stroll down the home straight. 
England, though, will bring in 100m silver medallist Adam Gemili and 
200m finalist Danny Talbot to try and test how fit the world’s fastest 
man really is after his foot injury in April.

‘We told each other “just get it round”,’ said Bolt. ‘Don’t stress. It was wonderful — just like the London Olympics.’

There’s
 no need to push it, Usain, but it was a wonderful night of athletics 
inside a sold-out, bouncing Hampden Park, with England winning a gold, 
three more silver medals and a bronze.

Steve
 Lewis won the pole vault, completing the full set of Commonwealth 
medals after a bronze in Melbourne in 2006 and a silver four years ago 
in Delhi. The 27-year-old, who has been sharing a room with fellow 
Commonwealth champion Greg Rutherford, beat compatriot Luke Cutts, 26, 
in a jump-off after both men had cleared 5.55m without recording a 
single failure.

For
 Lewis, victory was the perfect response to losing his National Lottery 
funding last autumn after failing to record a height in qualifying at 
August’s World Championships.

He
 said: ‘2013 was a really hard year, so I hope I’m back on track and 
that this is my springboard on the way to Rio (and the 2016 Olympic 
Games). It’s given me my confidence back.’

Playful: Bolt was up to his usual antics before and after the race, entertaining the crowd and the TV cameras

Relay: Jamaica (right), Nigeria (centre) and Australia (left) went into the home straight fairly even

Tiffany
 Porter won silver behind Olympic champion Sally Pearson in the 100m 
hurdles, with the Australian showing unusual emotion as she embarked on 
her victory lap. Pearson, 26, has suffered with injury and was also 
labelled ‘a bad example to the entire national team’ by head coach Eric 
Hollingsworth in the build-up to the successful defence of her 
Commonwealth title.

There
 was also a tear-jerking 800m silver for Scotland’s Lynsey Sharp, whose 
father Cameron won five Commonwealth medals, after a torrid year. Only 
four months ago she was in hospital, wired to an intravenous drip and on
 antibiotics after suffering an infection, wondering how on earth she 
would be able to qualify for, let alone compete in, Glasgow.

She
 was forced to miss last year’s World Championships with a leg tendon 
injury, had two operations in September and October and spent so much 
time rehabilitating on a bike that she seriously considered switching 
sports to cycling.

Even a couple of weeks ago in Lausanne, when she 
broke the two-minute barrier for the first time, she showed off the 
large plaster on her foot that protects a very raw wound when she runs. 
Sharp scraped through to the final as a fastest loser and then was on a 
drip again on Friday morning after ‘throwing up all night’.

Yet,
 with the words ‘get out strong, commit’ inked on her right hand, she 
found the energy to chase champion Eunice Jepkoech Sum of Kenya down the
 home straight. England’s Jessica Judd, 19, and Jenny Meadows finished 
fourth and sixth.

Sharp
 said: ‘This is my everything. This year has been obstacle after 
obstacle and there was no way I was going to go through everything I 
have and not get a medal.

Part-time
 model Isobel Pooley, 21, cleared a new personal best of 1.92m to win 
silver in the high jump behind 18-year-old world youth champion Eleanor 
Patterson of Australia. There was also success in the field for Jade 
Lally, who won a bronze medal in the discus by throwing a season’s best 
of 60.48m.

Competing
 at Hampden Park was a far cry from the 27-year-old’s usual training 
environment: a farmer’s field in West Sussex in which her father, Ray, 
built a concrete, Olympic-sized throwing circle.

Shelly-Ann
 Fraser-Pryce, another Jamaican 2013 triple sprint gold medallist, made 
her first appearance of the Games to anchor Jamaica to victory in their 
women’s 4x100m relay heat. England opted to rest 200m medallists Jodie 
and Bianca Williams, but still qualified for today’s final in second 
place.

England’s men’s and women’s 4x400m teams progressed comfortably as well.
