Grandeur: The Queen wore the Grand Duchess Vladimir of Russia's tiara which bore droplets of emeralds and The Delhi Durbar Necklace

Her tiara – the Grand Duchess Vladimir of Russia’s tiara - bore droplets of emeralds, chosen specifically for the occasion. The Queen otherwise would wear pearls.

Grand Duchess Vladimir, also known as Grand Duchess Maria Pavlovna of Russia, wife of the Grand Duke Vladimir Alexandrovich, was the aunt of Tsar Nicholas II, who was murdered alongside his family in 1918 by the Bolsheviks.

Grand Duchess Vladimir was the grandest of the grand duchesses at the royal court and she was no fan of the Tsar’s wife, Alexandra.

So she packed up her magnificent jewel collection and set up a rival court at which she could be the star of the show.

One of her most dazzling pieces was this very tiara of 15 intertwined diamond circles strung together with a diamond ribbon on top and hung with articulating pendant pearls, made in the 1874 by Bolin, the Russian court jeweller. 

She hid this wonderful example of intricate Russian craftsmanship in the vault at Vladimir Palace in 1918 when she fled St. Petersburg in the wake of the revolution. 

It remained hidden away until a friend of the family who happened to be a member of the British Secret Intelligence Service smuggled the jewels out of Russia for the Grand Duchess, tucked away in a plain bag.

With her jewels finally returned to her, she split them up amongst her four children before passing away in Paris in 1920. 

This particular tiara went to her daughter, Princess Nicholas of Greece. Princess Nicholas sold her jewels to benefit both her family and Russian charities and she sold this one in 1921 to Queen Mary. 

Queen Mary had to have some repairs after the tiara made its journey to the UK.

It was inherited by Queen Elizabeth on Mary’s death in 1953 along with the rest of her remaining jewel collection.

The necklace of diamonds and emeralds set in platinum and gold worn by the Queen was one of the principal elements of Queen Mary’s parure of diamonds and emeralds created for the Delhi Durbar of 1911.

The parure consisted of The Delhi Durbar Tiara, a stomacher (incorporating Cullinan V and VIII diamonds), brooch, earrings and this necklace.

The Cullinan VII was cut by Asscher’s as an 8.8 carat marquise and is suspended as an asymmetrical pendant on a detachable chain of ten graduated diamonds, to counterbalance the pear-shaped emerald pendant, which is pavé-set and similarly suspended from a detachable, graduated chain of 12 diamonds. 

The necklace incorporates nine of the Cambridge emeralds, originally owned by Queen Mary’s grandmother, the Duchess of Cambridge. 

The eight cabochon-cut emeralds are set between six large brilliant diamonds on a double platinum chain, with 94 smaller brilliant-cut diamonds.

The necklace was inherited, along with the rest of the parure, by The Queen in 1953.

During the banquet, the Irish song Molly Malone was played as the royal procession made its way into the room.

After speeches by the Queen and President Higgins, guests tucked into fillet of Isle of Gigha halibut with young leeks and fine herb sauce.

For the main course they ate tornadoes of Windsor estate beef with wild mushrooms and water cress puree, served with purple sprouting broccoli and sauce hollandaise, baked onions stuffed with Parmesan and Bulgar wheat.

For dessert guests were served vanilla ice-cream bombe with Balmoral redcurrant centre.

The long polished table - surrounded by 160 guests - was decorated with candelabras and flowers, including green Bells of Ireland, and other flowers with shades of orange and white to represent the Ireland's national colours.

Northern Ireland's Deputy First Minister and ex-IRA commander Martin McGuinness was seated next to President of the Royal Society Sir Paul Nurse and Director of Liberty Shami Chakrabarti.
