When it comes to phrases that annoy, it looks like it's 'whatever' - forever.

Pollsters at Marist College in Poughkeepsie, New York, found that Americans considered 'whatever' to be the most annoying word or phrase in conversation for a fifth straight year.

'Whatever' was judged most annoying in conversation by 38 per cent of adults, followed by 'like' at 22 per cent and 'you know' at 18 per cent.

Bringing up the rear were 'just sayin', and 'obviously'.

'Perhaps these words are introduced 
through popular culture, for example movies ... so they catch on,' said 
Mary Azzoli, of Marist.

'It has a lot to do with how accepted and how 
popular they become in every day speech.'

'Whatever' has had people grinding their teeth for decades after the catchphrase of Nineties Valley girls in California went global thanks to movies such as Clueless starring Alicia Silverstone, Stacey Dash and Elisa Donovan.

A poll by New York's Marist College of 1,100 people earlier this month found that 'whatever' was the most annoying word in conversation - for the fifth year running

The number of people irritated by 'whatever' was up 6 per cent on last year, the poll revealed. 

Those surveyed were asked what words they would like banned when talking about politics. The answers were:

Obamacare - 41 per cent

Shutdown - 30 per cent

Gridlock - 11 per cent

Fiscal cliff - 10 per cent

Sequestration - 4 per cent

Unsure - 4 per cent

Those who were most annoyed by the catchphrase were men from the Midwest, aged 45 to 59, who hadn't been to college.

Pollsters also asked what political word 
or phrase Americans would like to do away with in 2014 with 'Obamacare' 
topping the list for 41 per cent of people.

Almost a third (30pc) would like 'shutdown' banned from conversation and 11 per cent 'gridlock'. One in ten people asked do not want to hear 'fiscal cliff' and 4 per cent 'sequestration'.

The survey is split down the middle depending on political allegiance.

'Obamacare' is the most despised word by 59 per cent of Republicans while 45 per cent of Democrats shudder at the word 'shutdown'. 

The telephone poll of 1,173 adults living
 in the continental United States was conducted from December 3 - 5 and 
has a margin of error of plus or minus 2.9 percentage points.
