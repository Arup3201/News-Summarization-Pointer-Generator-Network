Sales of electronic cigarettes, labelled as a ‘healthy’ alternative to smoking, have risen tenfold in the last year, as celebrities help make puffing away ‘cool’ again.

Star endorsements of the devices have been credited as one of the factors behind new figures showing an increase in sales from £9million in 2012 to £90million in 2013.

Companies selling ecigs are also raking in the benefits from its products being allowed on screens, despite a 50-year-long ban on television ads for cigarettes.

Fired up sales: Actress Jenny McCarthy features in an advertisement for electronic cigarette company BluCigs

Images depicting smoking of electronic 
alternatives get around the ban as the products, unlike real cigarettes,
 do not contain tar or carbon monoxide.

Celebrities such as Steven Dorff and Jenny 
McCarthy have recently featured in television advertisements for 
ecigarettes, and both Kate Moss and Simon Cowell have been spotted 
puffing away on the fake thing.

Using electronic cigarettes, known as 
‘vaping’, allows smokers to inhale nicotine vapours without exposing 
their bodies to harmful components of a regular cigarette.

In the UK, 25 per cent of all attempts to kick the habit are made using e-cigarettes, making it the most popular quitting aid.

Around 1.3million Britons use 
battery-powered e-cigarettes, and sales of the fake fags are predicted 
to rise to £193million by the end of the year, hitting £339million 
annually by 2015, according to consumer analyst Nielsen.

In July, the British American Tobacco,
 makers of Lucky Strike, became the first tobacco company to launch a 
range of electronic cigarettes in the UK.

‘Tobacco companies, which are 
experiencing a long-term decline in demand for factory-manufactured 
cigarettes, are moving to cash in on the new trend,’ Andy Morton, UK 
commercial director of Nielsen.

However, not all are jubilant of the rise of the electronic nicotine sticks.

Across the pond, New York mayor Michael Bloomberg wants to rid his city of both real cigarettes and the electronic alternative.

Recently leaked drafts of three 
tobacco-related bills that are expected to be introduced into the City 
Council indicate that Bloomberg's planning to regulate e-cigs into 
extinction.

Sales of e-cigarettes are already 
banned in Norway, Singapore and Brazil, among others, and France is set 
to impose the same restrictions on ecigs as on regular smokes.

Holy smokes: Medicines regulators is forecasting that electronic cigarettes could help save 57,000 British lives over the next ten years

Amanda Sandford, research manager for 
ASH (Action on Smoking and Health), said: 'If smokers wish to try 
e-cigarettes as a way of cutting down or quitting smoking then these 
products could be attractive since they are cheap and don't involve a 
big financial outlay.

'However, we would advise people who 
want to stop smoking to speak to their doctor or pharmacist and use 
licensed nicotine replacement products as these have a proven track 
record as effective aids to quitting.'

The UK's medicines regulatory body, 
Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency, is forecasting that
 e-cigarettes could help save 57,000 British lives over the next decade.

According to the MHRA, studies suggest
 some e-cigarettes contain potentially harmful contaminants and there 
has been an anecdotal report of a user suffering facial burns after one 
exploded.

Although using e-cigarettes is safer 
than smoking tobacco ‘the long-term safety of these components to the 
consumer remains unknown’, it said.
