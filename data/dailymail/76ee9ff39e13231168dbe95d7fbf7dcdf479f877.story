If you think children only appreciate the latest, greatest, all-singing, all-dancing toys for Christmas, this  YouTube video will make for surprising, and comforting, viewing.

The clip shows Louie and Connie Cocker, three and two at the time, eagerly opening early Christmas presents, which turn out to be an onion and a  banana.

But far from being disappointed, the hilarious clip, which has now attracted over half a million YouTube clicks, shows Louie and Connie being genuinely happy by their bizarre edible gifts - if momentarily slightly bemused.

Adorable tots Louie and Connie Cocker have become YouTube stars this festive season as a video of them opening terrible Christmas gifts from their father has gone viral

Their father, and XFM Manchester presenter, Tim Cocker, 33, who lives in Chorlton with Louie and Connie's mother Kate, can be heard behind the camera telling the children: 'Because you've been really good, I'm going to let you open one present early.'

Despite believing they are about to receive exciting toys - Connie predicts she's getting a 'Barbie Princess and King Ken' and Louie, a Ben Ten watch - the onion and banana induce much excitement in their new owners.

Louie delightedly declares: 'I've got a banana Daddy!' before Connie chimes in thanking her dad for the 'pumpkin'.

'I was really proud,' Tim tells the MailOnline of his kids' reaction. 'It was a cheeky prank on my part and I wasn't sure how it was going to play out. It was pure childhood innocence at its best.'

'It made me go a bit misty eyed if I'm honest,' Tim admits. 'Fortunately Connie had an onion so I could just blame any watery eyes on that!'

Tim decided to try the little experiment to see whether the mere idea of getting a gift was enough to excite little ones. 

'I know that Louie and Connie are very fortunate that I'm in a position to give them the presents on their list, with Santa's help of course, but I'm also very aware that this isn't the case for all children.

'Do we really need to fight over the season's must have gift in supermarket aisles? Or is there still joy to be had with simply opening a gift, whatever it is?

'I thought this would test how grateful the kids were to be getting a gift at all.'

But even Tim admits he was pleasantly surprised by the reactions.

'Louie and Connie are happy, cheerful kids so I knew they wouldn't throw a major tantrum. But I never expected them to be that excited about some fruit and veg! 

'If only they were that excited about it when it's time to eat their greens at dinner.' 

The clip was shot three years ago but  only in the last two days has the clip become been widely shared on YouTube.

This year, Louie and Connie, who are now 6 and 5, won't be receiving fruit and veg on Christmas Day.

'Connie, like many children, is obsessed with Frozen so I've put in a request with Santa's elves to work extra hard on some of those toys.

'Louie is hoping Santa can add to his Hotwheels and Lego Star Wars collections. They've sent their letters to the North Pole so hopefully St. Nick will come up trumps again!'
