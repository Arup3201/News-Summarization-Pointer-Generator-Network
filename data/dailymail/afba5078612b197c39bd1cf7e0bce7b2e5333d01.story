Interest rate hikes being considered by the Bank of England would be a catastrophe for millions of families, a senior Tory MP said last night.

Mark Garnier, who sits on the Treasury committee in the Commons, said any increase would herald ‘a very difficult time’ for mortgaged households.

His warning came after publication of the minutes of the Bank’s rate-setting meeting revealed two officials want an immediate rise to 0.75 per cent.

Dr Martin Weale, left, and Ian McCafferty, right, both voted for the Bank of England to raise interest rates 

They were outvoted by the other seven members of the monetary policy committee, which met on August 6 and 7.

It was the first time since July 2011 that anyone at the Bank has called for higher rates. Five votes are needed for an increase – but analysts warn that day is fast approaching.

‘The tide is turning on the MPC,’ said Andrew Sentance, who sat on the committee before joining consultants PricewaterhouseCoopers.

Christian Schulz, a senior economist at Berenberg Bank, said the split vote was ‘a sign that the first rate hike may come slightly earlier than markets currently expect’. He added: ‘The Bank will not wait too long before hiking.’

The base rate has been at an historic low of 0.5 per cent since March 2009.

Hikes would be welcomed by savers but would hit cash-strapped households who are borrowing at the highest levels for six years. A rate rise to 1 per cent would add £456 a year to a £150,000 variable rate mortgage.

Mr Garnier said: ‘There is definitely a feeling now that interest rates will start to rise. When the day comes there will be households holed below the water line, and they will be in trouble.

‘The problem is that there is a huge amount of household debt in the country. People have forgotten that 0.5 per cent is an emergency level of interest rates. It is not normal at all.

‘If you are a saver, rising interest rates are fantastic. If you are a borrower it is bad news and for those that are already struggling, or close to struggling, raising interest rates will be a catastrophe.’

Figures from the Council of Mortgage Lenders yesterday showed mortgage lending is at its highest level since the financial crisis in 2008.

More than £19billion was handed out last month, equal to nearly £620million every day. A recent report from the Resolution Foundation thinktank warned that the number of ‘highly geared’ mortgage holders who are spending more than one third of their income on repayments could double from 1.1million today to 2.3million by 2018.

David Kern of the British Chambers of Commerce said: ‘Any increase in interest rates at the moment would be premature. The economic recovery is still not secure.’

The minutes of this month’s meeting of the MPC showed that Martin Weale and Ian McCafferty voted for rates to rise to 0.75 per cent immediately. The pair argued that ‘the continuing rapid fall in unemployment’ to a six-year low of 6.4 per cent, or 2.08million, and the likelihood that wage growth will pick up later this year, meant rates should rise.

The two economists appeared to be concerned that delaying the first rate hike could force the Bank into more aggressive action in future.

Governor Mark Carney voted to hold and analysts played down the prospect of an imminent move, pointing out the vote was cast before this week’s figures showed inflation has fallen to 1.6 per cent, well below the 2 per cent target.

Samuel Tombs of Capital Economics said: ‘The low inflation outlook suggests the odds are still in favour of a delay until early next year.’

A separate report from the Bank revealed ‘signs of an easing of house price inflation concentrated in the South’.

The Bank’s agents have spotted ‘fewer cases of sealed bids and offers over asking prices’.
