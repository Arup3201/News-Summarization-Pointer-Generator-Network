India's Virat Kohli continued his love affair with the Adelaide Oval when he scored his 22nd one-day century to drive India to a 76-run win over Pakistan yesterday.

The 26-year-old has now scored four centuries in five Tests and one-day games at the Oval.

'I want to wrap up this ground and take it home,' Kohli said after his 107. 'This has been a special ground for me.'

Kohli described the Adelaide Oval as 'special' following his fourth century in five apperances

Kohli, who hit eight fours in his 126-ball knock, had stands of 129 with opener Shikhar Dhawan and 110 with Suresh Raina as India made 300 for seven despite Sohail Khan's five for 55.

Pakistan were the architects of their own downfall as they slipped from 102 for two to 224 all out.

Kohli's 22nd century in his 143rd innings put him joint fourth on the list of most one-day centuries alongside his former captain Sourav Ganguly, who took 300 attempts to accumulate as many.

Only Sachin Tendulkar (49 centuries from 452 innings), Ricky Ponting (30 from 365) and Sanath Jayasuriya (28 from 433) are above him in the list.

South Africa's David Miller and JP Duminy both hit unbeaten centuries as they enjoyed a record World Cup fifth-wicket partnership in a 62-run win over Zimbabwe.

Their stand of 256 runs in less than 30 overs helped their team reach 339 for four in their Pool B contest in Hamilton with Miller scoring 138 not out off 92 balls, including 30 off the 48th over, and Duminy 115 off 100 balls. Zimbabwe could only manage 277 all out in reply.
