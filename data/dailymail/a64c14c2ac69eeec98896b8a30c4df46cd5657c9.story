Alan Pardew has blamed Yohan Cabaye for the 4-0 drubbing at Manchester City on the opening day of last season – and has warned the champions his side are much stronger one year on.

The France midfielder refused to play at the Etihad as he tried to force through a move to Arsenal.

Pardew, though, only learned of Cabaye's strike on the day of the game and his team subsequently put in a shambolic performance in which Steven Taylor was sent off for elbowing Sergio Aguero.

Blame game: Alan Pardew said last season's opening day defeat to Manchester City was Yohan Cabaye's fault

Cabaye, of course, remained at the club until January before moving to Paris Saint-Germain for £20million.

Newcastle are preparing to welcome City to St James' on Sunday, and Pardew said: 'At the time (last season) we were in dispute with our midfield player. When we got off that bus, was he going to play or was he not going to play?

'The difference now is we're much more settled.The disruption of that unsettled us.

'We lost a player (Steven Taylor to a red card) in the first half, which is maybe a consequence of the frustration we were all sharing.'

Pardew has added nine players to his squad this summer and believes Manuel Pellegrini will see a big improvement in the Magpies.

'We have a new-found sense belief and players grow when they see new signings,' he added.

Making his point: Alan Pardew has been busy in the transfer market  over the summer months

 'If you see more quality around you feel more confident.

'The players who have been here a while see that the group is bigger and stronger.

'I do feel we can give them a good game.'

Pardew will be without Siem de Jong (calf) and Chieck Tiote (hamstring) this weekend, but feels he now has the resource to deal with their loss.

'In terms of players we have now got a really strong group which makes my job easier,' he said.

'There is some real quality offensively, which we didn't have at the back end of last season.

Enforcer: Cheik Tiote will be important for Newcastle this season but will miss Sunday's match 

'I'm looking forward to putting them on the pitch and bringing back a brand of football, that the fans like to see.

'There are a few players out and normally that would be too big a blow against a team like Man City, but we're able to cope and that shows the strength in depth we've got.

'We go in good spirits with a fit, strong team and hopefully we'll give Man City a much better game than we did last season.'
