A shopper who told a mother to calm down her child during a loud tantrum was assaulted as a result of her polite request.

Natalie Bree Hajek-Richardson was at a Nordstrom Rack in Colma, California, when the infant, aged between four and six, started screaming next to her.

She turned to the child's mother and asked her to quieten him down. However the woman responded by saying she shouldn't be telling her child what to do.

Hajek-Richardson told KPIX 5: 'I told her that I didn't ask your child what to do, I asked you very nicely to calm down your child just a little bit.' 

Then she told the mom off and said she should 'go to hell' before walking away.

As she walked into the car, Hajek-Richardson said the woman then followed her and cut her off.

'[She] Was asking me, 'Where'd you tell me to go?' So I repeated again what I said to her, and I toldher that I told her to go to hell.'

Face off: As the pair come together, the unidentified woman asks 'where did you tell me to go?'. Hajek-Richardson tells her again to go to hell

Tussle: They then both end up on the ground after Hajek-Richardson is twice punched in the face 

CCTV footage from outside of the store shows a woman in a red dress approaching Hajek-Richardson.

'My teeth hurt, my elbow hurts, I got a bruise on my thigh,' she said.

Hajek-Richardson's gums are black and blue and she may lose three of her teeth.

Authorities are now analyzing the tape to see if they can identify the suspect.  

Aftermath: Hajek-Richardson says her teeth and elbows hurt and she has a bruised thigh as a result of the attack. Police are analyzing the footage in a bid to find the attacker
