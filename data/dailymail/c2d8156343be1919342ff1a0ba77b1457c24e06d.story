Many people rely on a cup of coffee or two to wake them up in the morning or pick them up during the working day, but now a chemist has come up with a speedy alternative to crafting a cuppa.

U.S. biochemist Ben Yu has created 'Sprayable Energy,' which claims to be the world's first caffeine - based topical energy spray.

He said flagging workers can spray a 'shot' of caffeine onto their skin without experiencing a strong buzz, loading up on unnecessary calories or being stuck with a nasty aftertaste like they might get from drinking energy drinks or coffee.

The website says the product 'can be taken in seconds, doesn't make you crash, is more affordable than current products and isn't full of mystery ingredients.'

Mr Yu, 26, and his venture capitalist business partner, Deven Soni, 33, are raising funds for their spray on crowd-sourcing site Indiegogo and have already exceeded their $15,000 target.

The patent-pending caffeine spray is an odourless liquid that is absorbed through the skin and distributed through the body over a number of hours to deliver a caffeine hit that apparently lasts longer than guzzling a cup of coffee.

The creators claim the product 'can be taken in seconds, doesn't make you crash, is way more affordable than current products, and isn't full of mystery ingredients. They recommend the product is sprayed on the neck or wrists, like perfume

Each small aluminum bottle of Sprayable Energy contains around 160 sprays - the equivalent amount of caffeine to 40 cups of coffee and the creators say it is a much cheaper way of getting a caffeine fix than popping to a cafe.

Mr Yu told Inc. Magazine that he came up with the idea as an alternative to coffee, which is 'like a roller coaster ride of energy,' The Huffington Post reported.

In a bid to develop an alternative, the biochemist researched nicotine patches and asked his father, who has a PhD in Chemistry to work with him to find out how caffeine can be easily absorbed.

The only active ingredient in the spray is caffeine, which the pair found can naturally enter the human body through the skin by passing through cell membranes as it is very similar to nicotine in structure.

The scientists found that as caffeine is not easily dissolved in water, it is difficult to transport enough of the stimulant in a spray to have a significant effect.

After months of research, they discovered they could increase caffeineâ€™s solubility 
five-fold by using a simple derivative of a naturally produced amino 
acid, tyrosine.

This breakthrough 'opens up a whole new realm of 
possibilities when it comes to energizing as effectively as possible 
without all the drawbacks and side effects,' said Mr Yu.

Each spritz of Sprayable Energy contains around a quarter of the amount of caffeine found in a cup of coffee, but apparently has the same effect as a full cup. The company said it is a cheaper and less calorific alternative to drinking a lot of coffee

Each spritz of Sprayable Energy contains around a quarter of the amount of caffeine found in a cup of coffee, but apparently has the same effect as a full cup.

The website said: 'The reason for this is our product not 
being ingested, isn't almost entirely metabolised by the liver before 
entering your system and becoming available to your body.

'Thus, a 
smaller amount of caffeine can have just the same effect as a very large
amount of caffeine ingested through an energy drink or cup of coffee.'

The founders of Sprayable Energy have already reached and exceeded their $15,000 investment target on Indiegogo where they are selling the product for $15 each as well as a 'zombie apocalypse stockpile' of 52 bottles for $449

Sprayable Energy's website recommends that users apply the spray in places where they normally spritz perfume, such as the neck or wrists, but warns users not to exceed 20 sprays a day.

It claims that after spraying the product on the skin, users will feel 'awake and focused without being over-stimulated,' which is common with coffee and energy drinks.

'Since our product enters your system gradually over a period of several hours, you wont have the 'buzz' that you get from caffeine products you drink (or the crash afterwards),' it said.
