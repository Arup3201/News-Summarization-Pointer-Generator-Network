A convicted madam running against former 
Gov. Eliot Spitzer in the race for New York City comptroller has been 
charged with peddling hundreds of powerful painkillers and other 
prescription pills.

Kristin Davis was arrested after she 
was caught on tape exchanging the pills for Ecstasy and cash as the drug
dealer was wearing a wire and working with federal authorities.Â 

Prosecutors
made the accusation against Davis while announcing her arrest on 
charges of distributing and possessing a controlled substance.

Day in court: Kristin Davis is escorted by media while she leaves the Manhattan Federal Court in New York on Tuesday

Bitter pill: In the latest twist to a scandal-hit city campaign season, officials announced the arrest of 38-year-old Kristin Davis, seen here leaving court today

Charged: Kristin Davis leaves the Manhattan Federal Court in New York after being arrested and charged with selling prescription pills for cash

Arrested: Former madam Kristin Davis, seen here in 2009, was arrested for distributing and possessing a controlled substance

Davis, 38, was to appear in court later Tuesday. Her attorney, Daniel Hochheiser, declined comment.

The
long-shot Libertarian candidate, who has a previous conviction for 
promoting prostitution, has made news by claiming to have gotten call 
girls for Spitzer before a prostitution scandal forced him from office.

Her
alleged connection to the Spitzer, who resigned from office in 2008 
after his trysts with prostitutes were exposed, has never been proven.

Davis
got into the comptroller race before Spitzer, running on a platform to 
legalize and tax marijuana as a way to close potential city budget gaps.

Other candidates include 
Manhattan Borough President Scott Stringer, also a Democrat, and 
Republican John Burnett, a former Wall Street executive.

According to a criminal complaint, Davis began buying Xanax, Adderall and Ecstasy from the unidentified drug dealer in 2009.

She allegedly told the dealer that 'she provided these drugs to others at house parties,' the complaint says.

Political venture: Davis has trailed Spitzer politically ever since he was exposed to have used prostitutes, and she was jailed for promoting prostitution. She ran in the New York gubernatorial race in 2010 (pictured), a move many thought was to keep his transgressions in the press, and now is running against him for Comptroller

In 2011, Davis asked the dealer if he would accept Adderall in exchange for Ecstasy, the complaint says, and they then traded 240 Adderall pills for 120 Ecstasy tablets.

Authorities arrested the dealer in December and he agreed as part of guilty plea to record his conversations with Davis, the complaint says.

In a recorded meeting on January 7, the cooperator paid Davis $675 in cash for 215 pills, it says.

'Ok, and this one is Ambien. There are 30 of those,' Davis allegedly said on tape.

Running mates: It has never been proven that Davis was the madam that Spitzer contacted, but she continues to allege that she was

Authorities also alleged that in April, Davis brokered a deal for another person to sell 180 oxycodone pills to the cooperator.

The complaint references a video that shows Davis bringing the person to the dealer's apartment, where the dealer used $3,600 provided by the FBI to make the purchase.

The Spitzer campaign declined comment on Tuesday.
