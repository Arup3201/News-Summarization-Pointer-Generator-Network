Husbands take heed: A New York man became an overnight multi-millionaire just for listening to his wife.

If it wasn't for the 80-year-old Harold Diamond's wife Carol, 74, he wouldn't have stopped at a gas station and bought the winning ticket for the $346million Mega Million jackpot.

The retired school principal was announced Monday as the sole winner of the jackpot drawn November 4 - the biggest prize in New York Lottery history.

'I always listen to what she says,' he told the crowd as he accepted his check today.

Always listen to your wife: Harold Diamond (right) was named the sole winner of November 4 Mega Millions jackpot. He says he bought the ticket out of boredom, when his wife asked him to stop at a gas station to wait out a storm 

One check: Diamond has decided to take his winnings in a $197million lump sum payment, which comes out to about $130million after taxes

Diamond said he bought the ticket at a highway service center where he had stopped at his wife's insistence to wait out a storm on Election Day. 

As they ate lunch at the Valero on Route 302 in Middletown, Diamond noticed the flashing Mega Millions sign and decided to spend $10 for 10 sets of Quick Pick numbers.

'I put the ticket in my wallet and forgot about it,' Diamond said in a statement released by New York Lottery. 

'I went to play golf the next day and the guys in the clubhouse were talking about the jackpot-winning ticket someone bought at a Valero on Route 302, and I thought, wait a minute — I bought a ticket there last night!'

Good decision: It was at this gas station in Middleton, New York that the couple stopped on Election Day and bought their winning tickets

Diamond said he dashed home, checked his tickets and found he had the winner.

'I was in a dither, a real daze,' said Diamond, who retired as principal of George L. Cook Elementary School in Monticello in 1995.

The New York Lottery's Yolanda Vega presented a giant ceremonial check to Diamond on Monday. He has chosen to take the cash in a lump sum payment of $197million, which comes to about $130 million after taxes.

Diamond says his plans for the money include helping family and 'giving back to the local community.'

He says they'll be thinking about it more on their upcoming vacation to Hawaii, for their 55th anniversary. 

'I simply can’t envision that kind of money,' Diamond said. 'It’s very hard to fathom. We feel very blessed.'

He said he owes his good fortune to his wife Carol, a retired Goshen High School math teacher.
