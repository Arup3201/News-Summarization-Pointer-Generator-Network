Defence Secretary Philip Hammond will go to the opening of the Bomber Command Memorial despite his department's refusal to pay for the ceremony

Philip Hammond has been branded a hypocrite for his decision to attend the unveiling of a new memorial to Bomber Command despite refusing to pay for the event.

The Defence Secretary will go to the opening ceremony even though the Government said it would not stump up £700,000 for the event.

Instead, war veterans are footing the bill to unveil it and will be personally liable for the cost of staging the event if they fail to raise the money through donations.

The opening of the memorial is a long-awaited event and there is a waiting list for veterans who want to be there on the special day.

Mr Hammond's attendance at the event means that one seat will be denied to them.

The Bomber Command Association has spent five years raising £6.5million to build the new memorial.

They
still have to find £700,000 to provide seating and security for the 
event on Thursday, which will be attended by ten members of the Royal 
Family including the Queen.

Fundraising
director of the memorial, Jim Dooley, told the Daily Express: 'Anyone 
with a measure of empathy will understand how the very elderly are 
anxious when faced with financial worries.

'We are the organisers of what has become all but a state occasion in the glare of international publicity.'

He
added: 'I find it hypocritical that a Secretary of State for Defence 
can turn up on Thursday representing the Prime Minister knowing a 
veteran trustee has his house on the line to pay for his seat.'

The monument, in London's Green Park, will commemorate the 55,573 Bomber Command airmen who died in the Second World War.

It
has already proved controversial after it emerged that more than 100 
veterans could miss out on the unveiling because of a lack of space.

Tribute: At the heart of the memorial will be the statues of a seven-man bomber crew cast in bronze

Earlier
this month, David Cameron gave the trustees hope when he told MPs the 
Government had 'the ability to intervene' if funds were not raised in 
time.

But now the trustees, who include four Bomber Command veterans, have been told the Ministry of Defence will not help.

Mr Hammond said: 'The MoD recognises the unique contribution and sacrifice that the men of Bomber Command made to protect Britain.'

Only as recently as last week, Mr Dooley said the veterans were still £500,000 short.

'The
MoD response to this has been disgusting,' he said. 'The unveiling has 
become a state occasion, yet we are getting no help from the state.'

Trustee
and veteran Harry Irons, 88, from Romford, Essex, said: 'If we can't 
get the £500,000 I will probably lose my house. I haven't got much 
else.'

The memorial was 
built with private donations, but the bill for its unveiling has risen 
because the 6,500 widows and veterans face security checks before they 
can enter Green Park.

Sculptor Philip Jackson created the 
9ft statues that will form the centrepiece of the memorial in Green 
Park, close to Buckingham Palace.

The Department for Culture, Media and Sport said it would 'make a contribution' but would not say how much.

The
MoD said it was not allowed to give to charities, despite records 
showing it has donated to 28 charitable bodies in the past five years.

A Government spokesman said: 'The Government does not usually support opening ceremonies for public memorials.

'However, given the unique circumstances of the Bomber Command Memorial, an exception has been made in this case.

Sacrifice: 53,573 members of Bomber Command were killed during the Second World War

Fundraiser Jim Dooley branded Mr Hammond a hypocrite saying trustees had put their houses on the line to pay for their seat

'The
Government will make a contribution towards the opening ceremony to 
help cover the additional costs of seating and security for the many 
veterans wishing to see the unveiling of this important memorial.

'This
is in addition to £1million that the Government has already contributed
towards the VAT costs of the construction of the memorial.'

Andrew
Robathan, Minister for Defence Personnel, Welfare and Veterans, said: 
'The MoD has worked very closely with the excellent people of the Bomber
Command Association to ensure a successful unveiling of the memorial.

'We
are delighted that a significant number of RAF personnel will be 
involved in the event, providing a flypast by five Tornado aircraft and a
Lancaster Bomber from the Battle of Britain Memorial Flight; ceremonial
elements by The Queens' Colour Squadron, University Air Squadrons and 
the Central Band of the RAF; along with ushers, hosts and catering 
services.'
