English MPs could have the power to veto new laws affecting England under plans to ensure 'fairness' for everyone in the UK.

William Hague announced the idea is one of three being considered to tackle the issue of English votes for English laws.

It follows concern that Scottish MPs could have the deciding vote on legislation which only applies south of the border.

Mr Hague today published the proposals aimed at delivering 'English votes for English laws'.

Under the most radical option, English MPs would have a separate vote in which they could veto an legislation - forcing the Government either to abandon the proposals or make changes to secure majority support.

Another option would mean English-only bills would go to an English-only grand committee at second reading and the remaining stages would be governed by a convention that means MPs from other nations would not vote.

A final option sets out plans that would allow only English MPs to consider the amending stages of legislation that relates only to England but the final vote would be open to all MPs.

All three proposals would involve Welsh MPs where legislation also relates to Wales.

Mr Hague told the Commons: 'This is a fundamental issue of fairness for all the people of the United Kingdom. Just as the people of Scotland will have more power over their affairs, so it follows the people of England, Wales and Northern Ireland must have the opportunity to have a bigger say over theirs.'

Labour has declined to take part in cross-party discussions on constitutional reform for England once Scotland is handed powers over tax, welfare and public spending. 

But senior Tories are determined to force a vote in the Commons on the issue early in the New Year.

They argue that Scottish MPs should be barred from having the final say on laws that only affect England, given Scotland's new rights to determine its own affairs.

And Conservative Right-wingers are warning Downing Street that anything less than full-scale reform will prompt a rebellion against Scottish devolution. 

Labour has indicated that it will only back the weakest form of 'English votes for English laws'. But Downing Street is thought to be backing the idea of an English veto.

National differences: English MPs could set English-only laws under plans for increased devolution

Following a committee stage of English MPs, legislation could be amended by MPs from the rest of the UK in the Commons. But English MPs would then get a final 'veto vote' before a Bill became law.

David Cameron surprised opponents by promising 'English votes for English laws' in the hours after September's Scottish independence referendum result – insisting that like Scotland, England must now be given more power over its own affairs.

Barring Scottish MPs from voting on key affairs would permanently hobble Labour's powerbase at Westminster, given the party's reliance on the support of its 41 MPs north of the border.

At the last election, the Conservatives won 296 of 533 MPs in England and would have had an overall majority of 59 in England.

The last Labour government passed several key pieces of legislation – including that of introducing foundation hospitals and tuition fees – thanks to the votes of Scottish MPs whose constituents were unaffected, given Holyrood's control over health and education policy.

Now a cross-party deal following Scotland's rejection of independence will see it also take control of income tax, VAT revenues and the introduction of new benefits.

On the warpath: New SNP leader Nicola Sturgeon visited Number 10 Downing Street yesterday

Scottish Nationalists last night signed a provocative electoral pact with the Greens and Welsh Nationalists that paves the way for a deal putting Ed Miliband in power in the event of another hung Parliament.

Scotland's First Minister, Nicola Sturgeon, on course to seize dozens of Labour seats at next year's general election, came to Westminster to forge a 'progressive' alliance against the Tories.

Fears are growing that the election could produce an effective dead heat between the main parties – with only a 'rainbow coalition' of three or more parties able to govern.

The SNP has indicated that in such circumstances, it would not prop up a Conservative-led government – but could offer support to Labour in return for a series of concessions.

Miss Sturgeon also paid a visit to Downing Street for her first meeting with David Cameron since she became First Minister.

The Prime Minister confirmed that youngsters aged 16 and 17 will be able to vote in the next Holyrood election. He said he would devolve the power to decide the franchise in time for the 2016 poll.

A senior Government source said: 'This question has now become unavoidable. We want a vote in the New Year. The middle ground is for English MPs to have a veto over anything that is going through in their name, but for the rest of the Commons to have votes at various stages.'

The source said the plan for an English-only committee was 'out of date' because it had been prepared before the latest round of devolution to Holyrood had been agreed. It was suggested by former Commons clerk Sir William McKay, and backed by Labour.

'McKay himself says that given the scale of devolution to Scotland, his proposal will need to be revised,' the source said. 'It was predicated on a very different constitutional situation. It is important English MPs genuinely get the decisive say.' Tory Right-wingers have warned of a rebellion against Scottish devolution unless there is full-scale reform on the English votes issue.

Former Cabinet minister John Redwood said: 'We don't vote on Scottish laws and they shouldn't vote on English laws. It is just equality.'

Tory MP Brian Binley said: 'The English people… don't want another layer of government; they want a straightforward English votes for English laws.'

A poll published today by Saga found that 76 per cent of over 50s in all four parts of the UK backed the view that Welsh, Northern Irish and Scottish MPs should be excluded from voting in Westminster on matters affecting England where those matters have been devolved to their respective assembles.
