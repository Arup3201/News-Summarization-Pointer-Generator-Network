Residents of Port Isaac are used to odd happenings around the Cornish fishing village, having played host to the cast and crew of ITV's Doc Martin for years.

But the sight of a yellow van firmly wedged between two buildings may have made even the most-hardened villager look twice to check that filming hadn't started again.

The over-ambitious driver of the van misjudged the width of a narrow lane and ploughed on ahead, but found themselves in a tight spot.

An over-ambitious driver found his van was too big for the narrow lanes of Port Isaac in Cornwall

The pretty Cornish village has lots of narrow lanes which were clearly too small for the contractor's firm van to navigate

It looked like the vehicle, which belonged to a contractor's firm, was at risk of losing its wing mirrors - not to mention risking the wrath of the owner of the mounted flowerpot on the wall.

The hapless driver was roundly teased for his embarrassing situation by local residents who posted comments online.

Nicola Phillips said: 'At what point 
when you’re squeezing your truck down this very narrow lane do you think
to yourself "oh dear.....maybe I should have taken another route..."'

The winding lanes will be familiar to fans of Doc Martin, which ended in 2011 and starred Martin Clunes as Dr Ellingham and Caroline Catz as his love interest Louisa

While Sara Taylor posted: 'These people follow sat nav but it’s not always a practical route!'

Thankfully, despite a few blushes, the driver managed to free the vehicle and get away from the scene.

Doc Martin, which last appeared on screen in 2011, stars Martin Clunes as a doctor who became a GP in the fictional village of Portwenn from London after developing a fear of blood which left him unable to do his job as a surgeon.
