Real Madrid president Florentino Perez called an emergency press conference on Thursday to express his support for manager Carlo Ancelotti and defend under-fire Gareth Bale.

Marca, the Madrid daily sports newspaper, had claimed on Thursday that the former Chelsea boss was close to being sacked, leading their front page with the headline: 'Not One More'.

Marca claim that defeat against Barcelona at the Nou Camp in 10 days' time would spell the end for Ancelotti, who led the club to a Champions League and Copa del Rey double last season. 

But, in direct response to that report, Perez said: 'To use the fact that we are not on our best form at the moment to report information that is not true is unacceptable.

'I want to state categorically that the club has full confidence in our coach and in our players. And I want to say, contrary to a report published today, that whatever happens in the coming days and weeks Carlo Ancelotti will remain the coach of Real Madrid. 

'As president of Real Madrid, I appeal to our fans to support our coach and our players and ask that they feel proud of them for all they have given us and for all they will continue to give us.'

Real have gone without a win in their last three games, surrendering top spot in La Liga to rivals Barcelona and only scraping through to the Champions League quarter-finals on aggregate after a 4-3 home defeat by Schalke on Tuesday night.

Ancelotti looks to the heavens as Real Madrid's winless run goes on and the pressure mounts on him 

World record signing Gareth Bale, who cost the club £86million, has been the subject of jeers and whistles from the club's fans for his recent form, as has captain and goalkeeper Iker Casillas.

On Bale - who, like Ancelotti moved to Madrid in the summer of 2013 - Perez said: 'Gareth Bale is one of the best players in the world.

'The biggest clubs fought and continue to fight to secure his services.

'The only thing I can say is that we shouldn't forget what he was able to achieve in his first year at Real Madrid.'
