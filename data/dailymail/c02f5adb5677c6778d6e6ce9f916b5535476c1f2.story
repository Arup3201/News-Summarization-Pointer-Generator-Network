Argentina today hit back at ‘verbal attacks’ David Cameron over the future of the Falkland Islands, insitsing the threat of British military action no longer inspires fear.

Hector Timerman, Argentina’s foreign minister, accused the UK of behaving in ‘an aggressive fashion’ and having ‘no moral authority’ to lay claim to the Falklands.

And he vowed that Argentina will continue to battle to reclaim what it calls the Malvinas, dismissing Britain as the ‘lion roars but does not inspire fear any more’.

Tensions between London and Buenos Aires escalated in 2013, despite a referendum of Falklanders in March showing 99.7 per cent wanting to remain a UK overseas territory.

The death of former Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher, who sent warships the South Atltanic after Argentina invaded in 1982, renewed speculation about whether the UK could mount a similar military defence today.

In a Christmas message, David Cameron vowed to counter Argentine claims to the Falklands and attempts to inflict damage on the islands’ economy, adding: ‘Britain will always be ready to defend the Falkland Islands.’

But in a 1,900-word newspaper article entitled 'A peaceful struggle', Mr Timerman claimed the message appeared to forget ‘the peace message that Christmas should inspire’.

Argentina's Hector Timerman

Writing in Argentine newspaper PAGINA 12, he accused Britain of flouting international law, issuing counter-productive threats and refusing to enter into negotiations over the future of the islands.

And he in a provocative assessment of Britain’s military capability to defend the islands, he added: ‘The verbal and military threats of the colonial power will continue to be met with Argentina’s demand for respect for international law and for UN resolutions.

‘In other words, the United Kingdom’s refusal to sit down at the negotiating table is compelling evidence that, in the question of the Malvinas Islands, the lion roars but does not inspire fear any more.’

The article was published to mark the anniversary of Britain reclaiming the Falklands on 3 January 1833.

Mr Timerman added: ‘This day, 3 January 2014, marks a new anniversary of the usurpation by Great Britain of Argentina’s Malvinas, South Georgias and South Sandwich Islands and the surrounding maritime areas.

‘A total of approximately 3 million square kilometres that belongs to the Argentine people and the deprivation of which impairs Argentina’s territorial integrity.’

He even claimed that despite an 
‘escalation of verbal attacks by British officials’, support for 
Argentina’s claims to the Falkland have ‘received renewed and vigorous 
support the world over, including in Britain’.

Argentina last year invoked new laws to punish oil firms seeking to exploit oil fields in the seas around the islands.

Mr Timerman said it was designed to ‘prevent foreign powers from continuing to plunder the resources existing in the land and maritime areas illegally occupied for over 180 years now’.

But the British Foreign Office insisted the activities were 'wholly legitimate and legal' and entirely under the control of the Government of the island - a British overseas territory.

In his festive message Mr Cameron said 2013 would be remembered as a ‘momentous year’ in the history of the Falkland Islands.

The referendum sent a clear message that the ‘Falkland Islands are British through and through and ‘the rest of the world has a fundamental duty to respect and honour what you have said so clearly’.

Mr Cameron added: ‘We look to 2014, you can count on the British government’s continued support in countering the Argentine government’s campaign to claim the Islands’ resources and to inflict damage on your economy.

‘The British government will remain steadfast in its commitment to your sovereignty and security.

‘The Argentine government will never succeed in any attempt to misrepresent the history of your Islands or question your right to self-determination. Britain will always be ready to defend the Falkland Islands.’
