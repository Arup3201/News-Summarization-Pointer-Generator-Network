French officials last night confirmed they are not even searching for missing schoolgirl Megan Stammers – because her maths teacher Jeremy Forrest is not considered a ‘criminal suspect’.

The authorities in France also said they will make no attempt to arrest the 30-year-old, even if he is found, because he has not broken any of the country’s laws, despite eloping with his 15-year-old pupil without her parents’ permission.

The revelation will fuel fears too little is being done to find the pair – who left Britain last Thursday night after Sussex Police began investigating their relationship.

Hunt: Teacher Jeremy Forrest and Megan Stammers were last
seen on CCTV getting on a ferry to France almost six days ago and have 
vanished without a trace

Even the suggestion that French police
have been waiting for Forrest to use his bank or credit cards in order 
to track his movements was rubbished.

The lack of interest in France in the 
runaway pair emerged as police in Britain faced searching questions 
about their own response to reports of what would have been a 
potentially criminal relationship.

As Megan’s parents waited for information it emerged:

While the schoolgirl’s disappearance 
has been making headlines across Britain, the coverage on the Continent 
has been much more muted, hindering efforts to track the pair.

New pictures: These images, released today, show how Megan is a fun-loving teenager, but she has also started an inappropriate relationship with her teacher - a man twice her age

First pictures: These stills taken from CCTV 
camera footage filmed aboard a Dover to Calais ferry last Thursday show

other

girl wearing a hat and walking a dog (left) tattooed on his arm earlier 
this year. He also has a floral display (right) on his other arm

The step-father of Megan Stammers had worked with the teacher she has fled to France with in 2010, it has been revealed.

Martin Stammers, right, said today that he thought that Jeremy Forrest 'seemed a nice bloke'.

The
teenager's mother and stepfather have said they were unaware of any 
relationship, and Sussex Police was only made aware of it last week.

Mr Stammers, 43, told The Sun that he worked with Forrest two years ago at The Causeway School in Eastbourne, where he teaches.

'I knew Forrest as a colleague. He worked at a twin school.

'He did some work for us about two years ago. He seemed a nice enough fellow - there was nothing out of the ordinary about him.

'But this is all about Megan and getting her back - then the police can deal with him.'

The age of consent in France is 15, meaning any intimate relationship between them would not be deemed illegal.

French prosecutor Jean-Philippe 
Joubert said Megan was old enough to travel with Forrest voluntarily, 
and unless the authorities received a criminal complaint from their 
British counterparts, she would simply be treated as a ‘missing person’.

Mr Joubert, the prosecutor of 
Boulogne-sur-Mer and one of the most senior judicial figures in northern
France, said Forrest is not a criminal suspect so it would effectively 
be illegal for police to arrest him.

‘The couple will only be stopped if 
they are spotted during an identity check on the road, or if someone 
recognises them from photos,’ he said.

The use of CCTV footage is much less 
common in France. Officials at Calais Port only began reviewing images 
yesterday, almost a week after the pair entered the country.

While some French media have shown a 
picture of Megan, many refuse to do so because of a fear of falling foul
of privacy legislation, while others have had no hesitation in 
describing the couple as ‘lovers’.

Denial: The Bishop Bell Church of England school in Eastbourne claim they have robust procedures in place to protect their pupils

Missing since Thursday: Schoolgirl Megan Stammers, 15, fled to France with her 30-year-old maths teacher

Police in Britain are believed to have been in possession of Megan’s mobile phone before she ran away.

The teenager’s friends also claimed that her mother had confiscated the phone in the days before she vanished.

The revelations will fuel questions about how much was known about the girl’s relationship with Forrest.

Megan was interviewed by officers a few days before she fled the country, according to one relative of the missing couple.

And Forrest was due to be suspended from school last Friday, the day the alarm was raised over their disappearance.

Distraught: Megan Stammers' mother Danielle Wilson and step-father Martin Stammers can't hold back the tears as they speak to the media at Sussex Police Headquarters in Lewes

A friend claimed Megan’s mother, Danielle Wilson, confiscated her phone just days before she ran away.

The 15-year-old friend, who spoke to 
the Mail with her mother present, added that this was not the first time
Megan’s mother had taken the phone.

She said that on August 29 she 
received a message from Megan asking her not to text her as her mother 
was due to take it away and would see her messages.

The text from Megan read: ‘Hi, could you not text after this as my mum is taking my phone away. Hahahahaha.’

The revelations follow confusion surrounding Sussex Police’s response.

In Britain, police have said that they
were only told about Megan’s relationship with Forrest last week, but 
have declined to specify which day.

They also first said that the pair 
left Britain in a Ford Focus, but subsequently corrected this to say 
they were in a black Ford Fiesta.

It was also unclear if officers 
initially realised that the couple had booked return ferry tickets from 
France to come back on Sunday night.

A spokesman for Sussex police declined
to comment on a report that officers had confiscated the phones of both
Megan and Forrest before they left, although a source said the report 
contained ‘inaccuracies’.

Backlash: Anne Diamond provoked a wave of response after she appeared to make light of Megan Stammers' eloping with Jeremy Forrest

Anne Diamond caused outrage yesterday after she flippantly dismissed the hunt for Megan Stammers as ‘a bit so whatish’.

The former breakfast TV presenter said the age gap between the missing teenager, 15, and Forrest, 30, was ‘not sickeningly huge’.

Her comments – made during Tuesday evening’s paper review on Sky News – prompted a wave of angry comments from viewers who said the 58-year-old was ‘out of touch’.

Miss Diamond, who has four children, began by telling Sky News presenter Anna Jones: ‘Clearly, this is wrong.

'He shouldn’t have done it and he must be tracked down and he must be brought to book for it, but it’s just got everybody talking about relationships others had with their teachers.

‘She’s 15, he’s twenty-something.’

The presenter interrupted to correct Miss Diamond about Forrest’s age but undeterred she continued: ‘At any rate it’s not a sickeningly huge age gap.’

Ignoring the fact that Megan is still classed as a minor, she added: ‘I’m not making light of what is a crime here...but nevertheless, again I feel it’s a bit so whatish.’

Miss Diamond’s remarks sparked an almost immediate backlash among Twitter users.

Jennifer de Santos wrote: ‘Anne Diamond just said “So what?” regarding Megan Stammers on Sky News. How utterly appalling and senseless.’

Lynn Ede wrote: ‘Cannot believe Anne Diamond on Sky News is saying can’t understand “big” press on runaway pupil with teacher! Have to say, presenter on Sky News also looked pretty shocked at Anne Diamond’s views...’

Richard Dixon wrote: ‘Bizarrely complacent attitude from Anne Diamond on Sky News re girl running off with teacher at school with poor safeguarding record.’

Search continues: Megan Stammers, 15, was last 
seen on CCTV boarding a ferry to Calais on Thursday night in a car driven 
by Forrest

Another user told Miss Diamond: ‘I cannot believe what I have just heard you say. Out of touch. That teacher is a disgrace to all in the profession.’ 

Paul Bradley added: ‘Anne Diamond on Sky papers. What a travesty. More clueless than she was in the 80s!’

Miss Diamond, who presents a radio show on BBC Berkshire, was unavailable for comment last night.

A spokesman for Sky News said: ‘We do not necessarily condone or agree with comments made by our guests.’

Ofcom, the broadcasting regulator, said it had so far not received any complaints about Miss Diamond’s comments.

Alias: Jeremy Forrest is a keen musician and performs under the name Jeremy Ayre

Megan and Forrest had been exchanging cryptic messages on Twitter for six months, many of which included song lyrics by various bands about being in love and having relationship problems.

She wrote messages such as: ‘Age is overrated’, ‘I’m probably just infatuated’ and ‘I just want to get on a train / in a car and go somewhere with you’, reported the Daily Telegraph.

When she wrote ‘I just want to runaway forever’, Mr Forrest replied: ‘Me & you. :-) Let's just run away.’ He also wrote:  ‘Your beauty took my breath away, in awe all day...’

Megan also tweeted in May: ‘Liking being around someone and their company so much that you just want to be with them 24/7... but you can't even get 5 minutes with them.’

And Forrest wrote: ‘I want to go everywhere with you baby, & for the record you never look anything less than absolutely beautiful... ‘
