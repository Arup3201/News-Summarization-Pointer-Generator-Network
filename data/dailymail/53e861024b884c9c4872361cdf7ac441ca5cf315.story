The Moroccan woman at the center of a sex scandal involving former Italian Premier Silvio Berlusconi has testified in court for the first time, describing how a young woman attending one of Berlusconi's 'bunga bunga' parties dressed up like a nun, danced provocatively and stripped down to her underwear for the premier.

Karima el-Mahroug took the witness stand in the trial of three former Berlusconi aides charged with recruiting her and other women for prostitution. They deny the charges.

The trial is separate from the one in which Berlusconi is charged with paying for sex with a minor - el-Mahroug herself - and trying to cover it up.

El-Mahroug, also known as Ruby, has 
made carefully orchestrated statements to the media since the scandal 
broke but has never publicly given sworn testimony. Both she and 
Berlusconi deny having had sex.

The three Berlusconi aides - Emilio 
Fede, an executive in Berlusconi's media empire; Nicole Minetti, a 
former dental hygienist, showgirl and local politician, and talent agent
 Dario 'Lele' Mora - are accused of recruiting women for prostitution at
 the parties and abetting prostitution, including of a minor.

El-Mahroug's testimony Friday 
confirmed the sexual atmosphere at Berlusconi's infamous 'bunga bunga' 
parties, which were filled with beautiful young women.

Many of those women have said they received money from the billionaire media mogul.

Dressed soberly with her hair pulled 
back,El-Mahroug said she first made contact with Berlusconi's inner 
circle when she participated in a beauty contest organized by Fede in 
Sicily when she was 16.

After that she made her way to Milan, 
hoping to find work. She said she tried to get work through another 
defendant's talent agency but wound up landing a job as a hostess in 
nightclubs, earning around 100 euros a night.

Eventually, she ran into Fede at a restaurant, where she reminded him of his promise in Sicily to help her.

Shortly thereafter, she was invited to a dinner party - at Berlusconi's villa outside of Milan.

She testified that she met the premier
 that night - on Valentine's Day in 2010 - and that he gave her an 
envelope of 2,000 to 3,000 euros, saying it was 'a little help' and 
asking for her telephone number, which she gave him.

At that party, she said, she 
introduced herself as Ruby and told other guests a fake tale that she 
was Egyptian, that her mother was a famous Arab singer and that she was 
related to then-Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak. She was 17 at the time
 but had passed herself off as being 24.

El-Mahroug confirmed Friday what other
 witnesses have testified previously: that at some of the soirees, young
 female party guests had dressed up like nuns and danced for Berlusconi 
and then stripped down to their underwear.

El-Mahroug said Minetti, one of the 
defendants, had dressed up like a nun at that February 14 party and 
lifted her costume to show off her legs as she danced in Berlusconi's 
in-house disco, which was outfitted with a lap-dance pole.

El-Mahroug demonstrated from her seat 
how Minetti had raised her hemline. She said Minetti eventually took off
 her costume and was in just her lingerie.

She said other girls dressed up as 
President Barack Obama and a Milan magistrate who is leading the 
prosecution against Berlusconi in the sex scandal.

The showgirl Marystelle Polanco dressed up in an Obama mask with a shirt and pants on and performed a dance.

'The girls who were dressed in 
costumes approached him in a sensual way as they danced. They raised 
their skirts,' El-Mahroug testified. She added: 'I never saw contact.'

El-Mahroug said she visited 
Berlusconi's mansion, Arcore, a half-dozen times, and that each time she
 was given an envelope with money, always in 500 euro bills. The second 
evening she went she said she was given around 2,000 euros.

Prosecutors in Berlusconi's separate 
trial have said El-Mahroug's testimony is unreliable and are relying on 
her sworn statements.

The defense had initially called her 
as a witness, but then changed its strategy and didn't call her. That 
trial is nearing a verdict.

Last week photos of the Italian Prime
 Minister's underground Bunga Bunga room were revealed as the trial for 
having sex with underage prostitutes carried on.

The infamous room was allegedly used 
to hold erotic parties at which women performed stripteases and were 
paid for sex, though Berlusconi denies that it was used for anything so 
risque.

At the time Miss El Mahroug, also known as Ruby the Heartstealer, was just 17 and technically a minor.

In Italy the age of consent is 14, but paying a woman under the age of 18 for sex is seen as a criminal offence.

Berlusconi and Miss El Mahroug have 
always insisted nothing untoward happened at the parties and he has also
 stressed they were nothing more than elegant dinners - a claim he 
returned to in his TV interview given to Canale 5 one of the channels 
the media tycoon owns.

He has always insisted he is the the 
victim of left leaning prosecutors and judges who are politically 
motivated and out to get him in the various trials he has faced, which 
have cost him millions of Euros in legal fees.

At the last count there had been more
 than 2,500 court hearings against him in which he was accused of crimes
 ranging from Mafia collusion, false accounting, tax fraud, bribery, 
corruption and perverting the course of justice.

So far none have actually ended with 
him being convicted indefinitely - in Italy a verdict is not final until
 it has reached the third and final stage at the Supreme Court in Rome.

Earlier this month a conviction for 
tax fraud was upheld against him and this now passes to the Supreme 
Court which will rule if the four year jail sentence should be enforced.

In the Milan trial he is currently 
involved in, Berlusconi is accused of paying for sex with a minor and 
abuse of office, as prosecutors claim he told police Miss El Mahroug was
 related to former Egyptian president Hosni Mubrak and should be 
released after she was arrested on a theft charge.

Prosecutors say that Miss El Mahroug 
was one of dozens of TV showgirls and wannabe starlets who were paid 
with cash, jewellery and cars to attend the parties and perform erotic 
dances and strip teases for Berlusconi.

Photographs have been published in 
Italian newspapers and magazines of women dressed a nuns and police 
officers dancing provocatively at the parties which Berlusconi hosted at
 his villa at Arcore near Milan.

If convicted of the sex charge, he faces three years in jail and for the public office he could be given 12 years.

Berlusconi stepped down as PM two 
years ago as Italy verged on the brink of a financial crisis, but 
mounted a spirited campaign in the recent general election which saw him
 come second to the centre left.

His People of Freedom party is now part of the ruling coalition.
