The scandal of Google harvesting personal data from millions of unsuspecting UK households took a new twist yesterday.

The internet giant admitted that it had failed to destroy all sensitive information stolen from unsecured home computers by its Street View cars.

Google signed an agreement in November 2010 to wipe all data collected by its cars as they photographed virtually every British road.

One of Google's Streetview cars, which was found to be collection data from nearby wifi networks. The firm today admitted it did not delete all of the data.

It came after it was discovered that 
personal data had been deliberately downloaded from wi-fi networks using
 sophisticated equipment in the vehicles.

The data included user names, 
passwords, telephone numbers, records of internet chats, bank details, 
medical information and information from dating sites.

But the company confessed yesterday that it did not in fact delete all the data collected over open wi-fi networks.

The Information Commissioner’s Office 
said this was a ‘breach’ of the undertaking.

In a letter to the privacy 
watchdog, Google’s global privacy counsel, Peter Fleischer, said: 
‘Google has recently confirmed that it still has in its possession a 
small portion of payload data collected by our Street View vehicles in 
the UK. Google apologises for this error.’

The undeleted data is understood to 
have been harvested in a 30-minute period around Tottenham Hotspur 
Football Club’s ground in North London. It is not known when it was 
captured.

Google offered to destroy the data but
 the ICO has ordered the company to hand over the computer discs 
containing the data ‘immediately so that we can subject it to forensic 
analysis’.

Investigators want to discover exactly
 what type of data is contained on the files before deciding what action
 to take. The privacy watchdog had already re-opened its inquiry into 
‘wi-fi sniffing’.

An ICO spokesman said: ‘This 
information should never have been collected and the company’s failure 
to secure its deletion as promised is cause for concern.’

If Google is found guilty of breaching the Data Protection Act, it could face a fine of up to £500,000.

The scandal has raised uncomfortable questions for the Tory Party over its close links with the search engine firm.
