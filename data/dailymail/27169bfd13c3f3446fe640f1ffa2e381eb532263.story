The CEO of Citigroup today quit his post unexpectedly but insisted the move was of his own accord, and that now was the ‘right time’ to do it.

In an exclusive interview with CNBC’s Maria Bartiromo, the 55-year-old said that while the transition to a new CEO may be abrupt, he also added: ‘It makes no sense for the old CEO to look over his shoulder.’

Pandit's sudden departure was made all the more dramatic by another announcement that the company's COO John Havens was also departing.

Speaking to CNBC, Pandit said that 
his departure was not because of money, citing four years ago during the
financial crisis where he accepted a token salary of just $1.

However, Bartiromo hypothesized that 
Pandit’s words could ring less than true, pointing out that as a hedge 
fund manager, he made hundreds of millions of dollars, and could not 
have been happy with his nominal salary.

According to reports, Pandit was paid some $15million as Citi’s CEO last year.

In addition, source told Bloomberg News that Pandit
had poorly handled several transactions, which in turn damaged the 
company. The source said that Citigroup’s directors had talked of 
letting Pandit go months ago.

And a second top executive also resigned
as part of the shake-up: President and Chief Operating Officer John 
Havens, who also serves as CEO of Citi's Institutional Client Group.

The company’s chairman, Michael E. 
O’Neill was apparently frustrated with the former CEO’s performance. 
According to the source, that irritation with Pandit led to his being 
fired.

He was awarded more than $15million in his 2011 compensation, but more than half of shareholders voted against it. The pay issue was thought to still be a source of friction internally, according to Reuters.

A representative for Citigroup did not immediately respond to MailOnline’s request for comment.

Pandit was known for steering the 
bank through 2008 financial crisis and the choppy years that followed. 
But within minutes of the bank's announcement, Pandit's name was gone 
from Citigroup's website.

His
replacement as CEO is Michael Corbat, the current CEO of Citigroup's 
Europe, Middle East and Africa division, the bank said.

The change is effective immediately. The bank offered no explanation for the sudden departure of its two top executives.

Corbat has worked at Citigroup and its predecessors since he graduated from Harvard in 1983, it said.

Pandit will also relinquish his seat on Citi's board of directors.

Citigroup's stock tumbled 2.5 percent in premarket trading following news of Pandit's departure, but later the shares were up 20 cents to $36.86 in early trading on the New York Stock Exchange.

Investors questioned why Pandit would leave now after keeping the bank afloat during the financial crisis and getting it back on a firmer footing.

'I would have expected he wanted to stay around and see some of the fruits of his labors there,' Peter Jankovskis, co-chief investment officer of Oakbrook Investments LLC in Lisle, Illinois, told Reuters.

Pandit's resignation comes after a series of high-profile defeats this year.

In March the Federal Reserve rejected the bank's capital plans after a stress test; Pandit had led analysts and investors to believe the dividend-raising plans would be approved.

Last month, Pandit agreed to a low sale price for his bank's stake in the brokerage operated by Morgan Stanley. Citigroup had to take a $4.7billion charge in the third quarter to write down the value of that stake.

Citigroup shares rose sharply on Monday after the bank reported third-quarter results that were much better than analysts expected.

Thanks to the dedication and sacrifice of people across Citigroup, we have emerged from the financial crisis as a strong institution.

Citigroup is well-positioned for continued profitability and growth, having refocused the franchise on the basics of banking.

Given the progress we have made in the last few years, I have concluded that now is the right time for someone else to take the helm at Citigroup.

I could not be leaving the Company in better hands.

Mike is the right person to tackle the difficult challenges ahead, with a 29-year record of achievement and leadership at this Company.

I will truly miss the wonderful people throughout this organization.

But I know that together with Mike they will continue to build on the progress we have made.

-Vikram Pandit

The one-two punch of the results and then Pandit's exit point to what analysts say has been a years-long unsettled atmosphere around the bank.

Pandit, 55, said in a statement that 'now is the right time for someone else to take the helm at Citigroup' after the bank 'emerged from the financial crisis as a strong institution.'

Pandit joined Citigroup in 2007 when the hedge fund he founded was acquired by the bank. He quickly rose to CEO in December 2007.

Earlier, he had ascended to head of investment banking at Morgan Stanley before leaving in 2005 to form the hedge fund.

According to Forbes, the naturalised citizen lives on Manhattan’s Upper West Side with his wife, Swati, and his two children, Maya and Rahul.

His salary last year – including bonuses and awards – totalled at $14.85million.

Born in Nagpur, India, the 55-year-old Pandit obtained two electrical engineering degrees and a doctorate in finance from Columbia University, having started his education at the Ivy League school at the tender age of 16.

He earned a doctorate in finance in 1986.

Pandit joined Citigroup in July 2007 when the bank acquired his hedge fund and private equity firm, Old Lane Partners LP, for $800million. Citigroup had to shut down Old Lane the next summer, an early black mark for the executive.

Critics later charged that Pandit was too timid, perhaps even too academic, to run a big consumer bank.

His successor, Corbat, has held a number of senior roles at Citigroup, including running Citi Holdings, the unit established to house businesses and assets the company wants to shed.

A fixed income salesman by training, Corbat started out at Solomon Brothers in 1983. More recently, he has been credited with successfully restructuring some of Citigroup's consumer and credit card units.

Pandit faced harsh criticism after Citigroup took $45billion in government bailout money in the 2008 credit crisis.

It is widely believed that other, stronger banks were forced to take billions in bailout money to divert attention from Citigroup, whose financial situation was more precarious.

The U.S. Treasury sold the last of its stake in the company in December 2010.
