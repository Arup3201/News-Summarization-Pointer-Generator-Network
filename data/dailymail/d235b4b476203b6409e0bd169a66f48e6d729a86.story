Singapore Airlines has issued an apology for their social media posts, made in the wake of Malaysian jetliner MH17 being shot down, which received intense scrutiny for being insensitive.

After the Malaysia Airlines plane went down over Ukraine with 298 people on board on Thursday, postings on Facebook and Twitter from Singapore Airlines claimed that its flights do not fly across Ukrainian airspace.

The remarks received hundreds of scathing comments across the social media platforms, from people both offended by the airliners lack of 'ethics' and others who claimed their post's claims were false.

Singapore Airlines posted this message on their social media pages following the announcement that Malaysian airline MH17 had been shot down

Other social media users responded to the airliners posts with outrage, claiming the company was being 'insensitive' and 'unethical'

'A post starting with condolence (and) then, stating your planes are diverted and not using this airspace anymore would have made (you) sound less heartless!' Joannica Dass wrote on Facebook.

'This statement is totally unethical. Have some respect for the one's who lost their lives,' Jose Zahirsha wrote on Twitter.

Others drew attention to tracking reports that recorded a Singapore Airlines plane traveling within 25 kilometres of MH17 just before it was shot down above Ukraine.

However, some social media users felt many were overreacting to Singapore Airlines' remarks, and said the carrier was merely trying to get a message across to its customers.

Messages of condolences were posted by Singapore Airlines after the initial posts, however the company still sent an email apology afterwards

'I don't think their comment was to advertise or boast their flight routes as much as it was to ease the tension of the hundreds of passengers that are scheduled to fly out to other countries over the next few days,' Karishma Sharma wrote on Facebook.

On Saturday, Singapore Airlines apologized and tried to clarify its remarks.

'We are aware of that our Facebook and Twitter update on Friday morning may have come across as insensitive to some. The post was in response to many requests from our customers who had asked for information about our flight routes for their upcoming flights with us,' Singapore Airlines said in an email to The Associated Press.

'We recognize that the information could have been better communicated and we sincerely apologize if it had offended our customers and anyone else in the online community,' it said.

Others were critical of news that emerged of two planes, including one Singapore Airlines plane, that had been flying over Ukraine only 25 kilometres from MH17 when it was shot down

Two other planes were revealed to be flying within 25 kilometres of MH17 over Ukrainian airspace, as the Malaysian Airlines plane was shot out of the sky.

The news comes alongside criticism and questions as to why commercial plane's were flying over the airspace at all after the airspace was declared a war zone.

According to Crikey, two other aircraft had been shot down above Ukraine in the week before the MH17 tragedy, a Ukrainian military cargo plane and a Ukrainian jet fighter.
