A young father returning to Sacramento from the war in Afghanistan met his baby boy for the first time yesterday.

Sgt Brandon Niles, 35, who has been serving in Afghanistan for 10 months, was met in the airport by his fiancee, Janell Mosley, and their first child Braeden - who was born just three days after his father was deployed,  the Sacramento Bee reports.

The family had a tender moment in Terminal 5 of the International Airport as a delighted Brandon held his son for the first time.

The blond baby was happy for a few moments but, perhaps unsurprisingly, soon wanted to go back to the arms of his mom, who has been raising him for the past 10 months with the support of both parents' families.

'I can't get that time back,' Brandon told the Sacramento Bee of his time away. 'I wanted so badly to see him when he was smaller, like the size of a football. Hopefully, he won't even remember that I was gone.'

'It was a lot harder than I thought it was going to be,' he added.

The family kept in touch via the internet and Brandon tried to watch Braeden's progress online.

However it proved difficult for the National Guard unit sergeant as the connection was inconsistent.

His fiancee, who has a 4 year-old son, Joshua, from another relationship and stayed with family for much of the time Brandon was away, agreed it had been difficult. .

'It's been a really, really hard year, definitely tough,' she said, before adding: 'It's exciting to watch them get to know each other.'

Sgt Niles' mother and brother also greeted him home - expressing their relief he had been returned safely.

'We just thank our lucky stars,' said his brother Cameron Niles. 'I'm excited, ecstatic for him. The feeling is indescribable.'

'I'm just so happy to have him home safe,' his tearful mother, Annette Niles added.

The painter contractor by trade served as a truck driver and sharpshooter while in service in Northern Afghanistan.

Despite his long absence from his family, he wasn't against the idea of his young son signing up to join the armed forces.

'Maybe if he decides to join the military someday, we can talk about it [my time in Afghanistan],' he said.
