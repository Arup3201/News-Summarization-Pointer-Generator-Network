Singer Michael Franti filmed his now-fiancee Sara Agah for three years in order to create the romantic engagement video he had used to propose to her in Bali. 

The 48-year-old listed his longtime love's most endearing qualities in the clip featuring his 2013 song Life Is Better With You - which he had written for her.

Mr Franti announced the news Tuesday on Facebook, where he shared the special video with his fans, writing: 'Sara and I are engaged to be married!'

True love: Michael Franti proposed to Sara Agah using a touching engagement video he created after filming her for three years

'I wrote Life Is Better With You three years ago as a song I hoped to be played at our future wedding and made this video for Sara using clips I shot of her on my iPhone over the past three years.'

The musician explained that he and Ms Agah had gotten engaged during a surprise dinner he had planned for her in Bali. It was there that he played his song on his acoustic guitar and showed her the video as a part of his proposal.

'Needless to say she was quite moved and luckily for me after getting down on one knee and asking officially, she said "yes!'" he noted, adding: 'Thank you all who have been so kind to us over the years.'

I do: Mr Franti played the video and proposed to Ms Agah during a romantic dinner in Bali 

The romantic video features intimate moments from the couple's everyday lives, including footage of Ms Agah dancing, singing, practicing yoga and being goofy. It has received nearly 25,000 likes on Facebook since it was posted. 

Mr Franti's sweet gesture is a reminder that love is about life's simple moments.

The Michael Franti & Spearhead frontman told Rolling Stone in 2013 that he was inspired to write Life Is Better With You after he and Ms Agah had a 'not-so-great day' following a happy Valentine's Day.

He recalled: 'I told her that even my worst day with her is better than any day I had before she was in my life, and out came the words: "Life is better with you."'

Perfect woman: In the clip, Mr Franti listed all the reasons why he loves Ms Agah 

'I picked up the guitar and wrote the song right then. I hope it inspires gratitude through the ups and downs of relationships for couples, friends, parents and kids.' 

Mr Franti met the emergency nurse and jewelry designer at a festival in Canada. They were friends for three years before they started dating. 

'The relationship works because I've grown wiser,' he told The Sydney Morning Herald last year. 

He added: 'Communication isn't about just your side being heard - it's about being clear, and understanding what the other person is saying and feeling. Listening is the key.'

Mr Franti has two sons, Cappy and Ade, from former relationships. He was previously married to Ade's mother Tara Franti-Rye.
