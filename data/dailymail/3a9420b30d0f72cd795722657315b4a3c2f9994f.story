The harrowing story of child kidnap victim Natascha Kampusch’s
eight-year ordeal at the hands of her  captor is set to be told on the big screen.

The film titled 3,096 after the number of days the young Austrian was held by Wolfgang Priklopil is due to begin shooting in Munich next month.

Northern Irish actress Antonia Campbell-Hughes has been named in the
lead role which will cover the time Ms Kampusch was held hostage from 1998 until her escape in 2006.

Being cast in the controversial biopic is Ms Campbell’s
big break after picking up roles in the Jack Dee sitcom Lead Balloon and the
Dublin-based movie Albert Nobbs

Amelia Pidgeon, ten, from London, has been selected to play the
young Kampusch in the years leading up to her abduction.

The film will be directed by Sherry Hormann, with Thure Lindhardt playing Priklopil.

Ms Kampusch agreed the rights to the movie after signing a
deal with German writer Bernd Eichinger but the plan was put on hold after his
death in January  last year.

The new
movie will be based on the book of the same name which was written by Ms
Kampusch and published in September 2010.

The Viennese woman’s story shook the World after it came to
light following her dramatic escape from clutches of Priklopil in 2006.

Her
captor subsequently committed suicide
as he was chased by police.

Priklopil was an Austrian communications technician who kidnapped
Kampusch on the morning of March 2, 1998 as she was on her way to school,
eventually keeping her in a custom built basement (sometimes referred to as a 'dungeon' in news reports) under his house in Strasshof near
Gänserndorf, in Lower Austria.

On the morning she went missing a 12-year-old witness
reported having seen Ms Kampusch being dragged into a white minibus by two men,
although when interviewed years later she did not report a second man
being present.

A massive police effort followed in which 776 minivans were
examined including that of her kidnapper, who lived about half an hour from
Vienna by car.

Although he stated that on the morning of the kidnapping he
was alone at home, the police were satisfied with his explanation that he was
using the minibus to transport rubble from the construction of his home.

Speculation about child pornography rings and organ theft were put forward, leading officials to also investigate possible links to the crimes of
the French serial killer Michel Fourniret.

Because Ms Kampusch had carried her passport with her when she
left (she had been on a family trip to Hungary a few days before), the police
extended the search abroad.

Accusations against Ms Kampusch's family complicated the issue
even more and there have even been unsubstantiated allegations that her
mother was somehow involved in the abduction or its cover-up.

Priklopil killed himself by lying down on a train track, a few hours after Kampusch walked out of his garden gate while he went to answer a phone call.

She had been increasingly allowed her freedom as she approached adulthood. After her escape, she worked as a chat-show host.
