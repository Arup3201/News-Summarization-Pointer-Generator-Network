Two boy racers killed Lucy Commins, 16, when they crashed their souped-up cars during a street race

Two boy racers killed a 16-year-old girl when they crashed their souped-up cars during a high speed street race.

Lucy Commins was a passenger in a Mercedes CLK when the car collided with a VW Golf being driven by Sean Sparkes, 32, in Coventry on February 22.

He had been racing against Reece Jones, 23, who was in a Ford Fiesta, when he lost control and ploughed into the other car at around 11.25pm.

Warwick Crown Court heard the pair had been racing each-other at high speeds when the Mercedes pulled out of a side road in front of them.

Lucy was pronounced dead at the scene at the junction of Hinckley Road and Woodway Lane in Coventry.

Sparkes' Golf smashed into the Mercedes, while Jones - who was disqualified from driving at the time -  managed to swerve round it and speed off.

He then drove away in his distinctive Fiesta which he then hid before changing its appearance to cover his tracks.

Sparkes and Jones were jailed  after admitting one count each of causing death by dangerous driving and causing serious injury by dangerous driving.

Sparkes, from Bulkington, Warwikshire, was sentenced to five years and nine months and another nine months for perverting the course of justice.

He was also given a two-year-and-six-month sentence, to be served concurrently, for causing serious injury to the other passenger.

He was disqualified from driving for four years and will have to take an extended retest before he can return to the road.

Jones, from Wyken, in Coventry, was jailed for a total of seven years and three months for death by dangerous driving and perverting the course of justice.

He was also disqualified from driving for five years.

Speaking in a statement after her death Lucy's devastated family said: 'We would like to take this opportunity to thank well-wishers and pay tribute to our beautiful daughter.

'The sudden and tragic loss of Lucy has left her family and friends devastated.

'Lucy lived life to the full. She loved to socialise with friends, loved animals and listening to music, she could not decide if she wanted to be a vet or a DJ.

'We would also like to take this opportunity to express our gratitude to those who organised events and made donations in Lucy's memory.

'Their help was very much appreciated.'  

After the hearing Lucy's family released another tribute to the popular teenager in a statement issued by police

They added: 'From the moment Lucy was born she was our princess.

'Lucy was a very happy, caring girl who loved life and enjoyed spending time with friends and family.

'Lucy was a typical teenager who had lots of goals and aims in life.

'She couldn't wait to leave college, pass her driving test and eventually start a family of her own.

'Lucy had so much life ahead of her and we will all miss out on seeing her achieve her goals and grow into a woman.

'The whole family is broken and we will never be the same again.

'All the material possessions in the world could never replace a child. We would rather be penniless and living in a cardboard box if it would mean having our little girl back.

'We will never again be able to hear her voice, hold her close, see her smile or hear her cheeky laugh.

Lucy was pronounced dead at the scene at the junction of Hinckley Road and Woodway Lane in Coventry. Her family described her as a 'very happy, caring girl who loved life'

'Any sentence given will never be enough as it will not bring our baby back.

'The people responsible have not only taken Lucy's life, they have taken the life from our whole family. We are left serving a life sentence.

'Lucy's four-year- old niece says goodnight to the stars and kisses Lucy's picture every night, and her 10 year old niece wrote about her and said "She used to look after me and my little sister and she used to take us everywhere. I still can't believe I'm not going to see her again until I go to heaven."

'The family would like to thank everyone concerned for their help and support at this difficult time.

'It is the only thing that's kept us going.'

Another 37-year-old man, who cannot be named for legal reasons, will appear alongside Donaldson at Warwick Crown Court on December 12.
