Dreamer: Mark Welch, 18, has been charged with misusing the 911 system after he allegedly called police to share his dream

An 18-year-old Florida man has found himself in trouble after he dialed 911 while allegedly high on drugs not to report an emergency, but rather to share a disturbing dream he had.

When Mark Welch, of Volusia County, woke up Sunday night, he had a desperate urge to tell someone about his vision, which he now thought was coming true. He tried his parents, but they did not believe him, so the 18-year-old did the next logical thing: he called police.

‘Something that happened in my dream and it's actually happening,’ Welch told replied a Volusia County 911 dispatcher.

According to the Orlando Sentinel, The dispatcher attempted to make sense of the situation and played along, asking the caller  what was happening.

‘Everything that happened today is actually in my dream and I want to prove it to everybody,’ Welch said, adding that he put everything to paper.

A Volusia County sheriff’s deputy responded to Welch's home near Orange City and found the teen to be confused. It is believed that the 18-year-old smoked synthetic marijuana known as K2.

According to the Sheriff’s Office, Welch did not need medical attention, and the deputy warned him not to call 911 again, unless he had an emergency.

Sheriff's officials said Welch's parents hid the phone so he wouldn't call authorities again, but that did nothing to deter the tenacious dreamer.

Hallucinogenic: Welch is believed to have smoked the synthetic drug K2 before making the call

About 40 minutes after placing the first call, Welch went to a neighbor's home and dialed  911 again.

Another dispatcher asked Welch what his emergency was.

Dispatcher: 'What's happening?'

Welch: 'Everything that happened today is actually in my dream, and I want to prove it to everybody.'

Dispatcher: 'What did you dream about that's happening?'

Welch: 'It's all on paper. I wrote it down.'

‘The officer told me not to call back. And he said if I call back then y'all are going to take me to court. So I'm calling back. I have to prove something,’ Welch said during the call.

‘Cause you want to go to jail?’ the dispatcher asked.

Welch replied: ‘I have to prove something to my family.’

Welch admitted he had no emergency, 
but the Sheriff's Office once again dispatched a deputy who turned out to
be the same officer who paid the 18-year-old a visit earlier.

This time, Welch was arrested and charged with misusing the 911 system. He was booked into the Volusia County Jail on $500 bond.
