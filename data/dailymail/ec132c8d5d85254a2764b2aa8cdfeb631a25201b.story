Anna Duritskaya, 23, pleaded to be allowed home to her native Ukraine but was said to be under police guard for further questioning

The girlfriend of murdered Russian politician Boris Nemtsov was under armed guard at an unknown location last night, as tens of thousands marched in Moscow in his name.

The former deputy prime minister and leading critic of Vladimir Putin was gunned down as he walked home from dinner on Friday with Anna Duritskaya.

The model, 23, pleaded to be allowed home to her native Ukraine, but was said to be under police guard yesterday for further questioning. 

She is understood to have given a description of the killer, despite partial ‘memory loss’ from ‘deep shock’, a law enforcement source said. 

As an ‘immediate eyewitness’, there were ‘grounds to conduct additional investigative action regarding her’, the source added.

Last night it emerged the head of Russia’s Investigative Committee, Alexander Bastrykin, who will lead inquiries into the murder, is a Putin loyalist with a history of intimidating the Press. 

He once threatened to behead a journalist and investigate the killing himself.

Ukraine’s consul in Moscow, Gennady Breskalenko, said Miss Duritskaya was questioned until 5am on Saturday at the Investigative Committee building, where he had tried to see her.

Ostap Semerak, a Ukrainian MP, said the model’s parents were concerned. He said Miss Duritskaya told them by phone that she had ‘no idea where she is kept’, only that she was ‘taken to some flat which is guarded, and she is not allowed to leave’.

Associates of Mr Nemtsov said she was staying with a friend.

The opposition leader had organised the protest against Russia’s involvement in Ukraine, but it became a mourning rally, with chants of ‘Russia without Putin’. Police claimed 16,000 marched, but observers said there were up to 70,000, with several thousand more in St Petersburg.

David Cameron said he was ‘shocked and sickened by the callous murder’ and that Mr Nemtsov was ‘dedicated to speaking up tirelessly for the Russian people, demanding their right to democracy and liberty … and to an end to corruption’.

Mr Nemtsov, 55, a former nuclear scientist, rose to prominence under Boris Yeltsin, after the Cold War, becoming deputy prime minister in 1997.

Thousands of people took to the streets of Moscow to protest against his murder with any attributing blame to the Russian President

The 55-year-old was shot four times by an unknown killer. He was a vocal critic of Putin throughout his career

After leaving parliament in 2003, he founded opposition movements and was a vocal critic of Mr Putin over Ukraine, the economic crisis and corruption.

Voters in Estonia appear to have turned away from a party that supports closer ties with Moscow.

Pollsters say first returns, based on online voting, heavily favour the Reform Party of Prime Minister Taavi Roivas, with 37.5 per cent, more than the 28.6 per cent it won in 2011.

The opposition Centre Party, which supports closer links with Moscow, had just 7.7 per cent – compared with the 23.3 per cent it won in 2011. 

But it is thought these voters have less access to the internet.

A married father of four, he is understood to have been with Miss Duritskaya for three years.

She was unharmed when he was hit by four of seven bullets fired from a white Lada on a bridge near the Kremlin.

Mr Nemtsov had warned that Mr Putin wanted him dead. But the Kremlin strongly denied any official responsibility for the killing.

Investigators said they were looking at the possibility he was killed by opposition figures, or that Islamic extremists targeted the Jewish politician.

In an interview hours before his murder, Mr Nemtsov accused a ‘mad’, ‘aggressive’ Mr Putin of lying over the Ukrainian conflict and called his rule a ‘catastrophe’.

The president wrote to Mr Nemtsov’s mother, promising to ‘do everything’ to ensure the perpetrators are ‘properly punished’. 

The government is offering £31,500 for information leading to the killer.
