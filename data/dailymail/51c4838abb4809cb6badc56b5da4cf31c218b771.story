Danny Welbeck cannot wait to play in the 'unbelievable' Celtic Park atmosphere as England look to continue their fine recent run against Scotland.

The Three Lions travel north of the border for the first time since 1999 on Tuesday, when international football's oldest rivals meet for the 112th time.

The occasion may only be a friendly but the atmosphere inside Celtic Park will be anything but.

The Glasgow roar is something Welbeck is looking forward to, with the Arsenal forward confident England will flourish rather than wilt in the hothouse.

'Obviously it is only a friendly but we want to win every single game,' he said.

'We can't go in thinking we are going to do anything else than that.

'It is going to be a great atmosphere. I watched the game against the Republic of Ireland the other night and the atmosphere sounded unbelievable. I just can't wait to get out there and taste it.'

As well as bragging rights, Tuesday's match offers England the opportunity to maintain momentum.

Emotions remain raw following the World Cup embarrassment, yet Roy Hodgson's men have responded impressively to that disappointment.

Saturday's 3-1 win against Slovenia made it five wins on the bounce since Brazil, keeping their 100 per cent start to Euro 2016 qualifying intact.

Welbeck's brace complemented a penalty from centurion Wayne Rooney in that win at Wembley, where England recovered impressively from falling behind to a second-half Jordan Henderson own goal.

'It was a good night all round,' Welbeck said. 'It is obviously pleasing to get the win in the end.

'The most important thing was the way the team responded to going a goal down.

'I think what we can do now obviously is play our game and make sure we are prepared for the next match.

'I can't really go back too much to the summer. We can't change anything from there now, so the most important thing is to prepare well for the next game and obviously try to get the win.'

Welbeck may have scored twice but he is all too aware that he was never going to outshine Rooney on such a momentous occasion.

The 29-year-old became the youngest-ever English centurion on Saturday, leading the comeback against Slovenia by earning the penalty from which he then levelled.

'Obviously everyone is very pleased for Wayne,' his former Manchester United team-mate Welbeck said.

'In a way it was kind of inevitable he was going to score that goal.

'Once the penalty came around, you just knew he was going to stick it in the back of the net.

'It was great for him to get the goal on his 100th cap, captaining the team.'

The win against Slovenia continues England's seemingly unstoppable march towards Euro 2016.

Despite only being four games into Group E, their 12-point haul is twice as much as Slovenia, Switzerland and Lithuania in joint-second place.

The top two automatically qualify for the finals and the third-placed side can also progress, yet Welbeck insists qualification is not a formality.

'No, I think we've got to obviously prepare for each and every single game,' he said.

'Every team is going to come to Wembley and try to make it difficult for us.

'Slovenia did that in the first half and we had to kind of change up the tactics a little bit.

'We worked on that throughout the week and in the second half we created some decent chances and put them away.'
