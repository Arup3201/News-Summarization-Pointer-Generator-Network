One of a kind: Wild Bill Hickok's Smith & Wesson revolver has added value because he was wearing it when he was shot dead

The revolver worn by infamous gunslinger 'Wild' Bill Hickok when he was shot dead 150 years ago is expected to sell for $500,000 at auction.

The legendary Smith and Wesson pistol was worn by the lawman in 1876 when he was shot in the back of the head while playing poker in South Dakota.

It will be sold at Bonhams auction house in San Francisco in November. The antique piece boasts a .32 rimfire, a six-inch barrel and varnished rosewood grips.

The gun comes with documents proving its origins and details of how it passed through generations of the Willoth family in Deadwood.

Paul Carella, Bonhams' arms and armour expert, said: 'Wild Bill Hickok was one of the most iconic figures of the Wild West.

'He was friends with Buffalo Bill and Calamity Jane and was noted as the best quick-draw shooter of his time.

'He was a stagecoach driver, a lawman, a scout - he was everything that epitomised the Wild West.

'He had moved to Deathwood to find his fortune in the gold rush and also to make some money from gambling. Ironically he died at the poker table.'

Hickock had a habit of sitting with his back to a wall when playing poker, but on the day of his death, the only spare chair had its back to the door

Mr Carella said: 'Following his death his effects were
given to the new sheriff who then gave the gun to a family who ran a 
bazaar yo pay off debts Wild Bill had with them.

'The gun has been in the family ever since.

'It would have been worth about $15, around $500 in today's money.

Notorious: A friend of Buffalo Bill and Calamity Jane, Wild Bill was known as the best quick-draw shooter of his time and a wily poker player

Tribute: The Deadlock bar where Wild Bill was shot and his gravestone show he died in 1876.Â  The cards he has in his hand at the time of this death is now known as a 'dead man's hand' in the game

'It's just a standard Smith and 
Wesson pistol in average condition that would normally sell for around 
$2,000 but because of its history we expect it to go for much more.'

Mr Hickok was shot dead by 'Crooked Nose' Jack McCall. At the time he was holding two black 
aces, two black eights and another unknown card, which went on to be
known as the 'dead man's hand' in poker.

McCall claimed he had shot Hickok in revenge for killing his brother. He was later hanged for the murder.

Hickok started calling himself 'Wild Bill' after winning a deadly shootout in 1861.
