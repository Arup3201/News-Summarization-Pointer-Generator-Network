A grinning serial female thief has been jailed for five years for repeatedly tricking her way into elderly people’s homes to steal their valuables.

Geraldine Podmore, 31, asked her victims to call a taxi for her and then distracted them while she helped herself to cash, mobile phones and women’s handbags.

A court heard drug addict Podmore targeted two residents at sheltered housing complex in Longton, Staffs., on November 22.

The first was an 83-year-old man who answered the door to the defendant at 7.20pm.

At Stoke-on-Trent Crown Court prosecutor Heather Chamberlin said: 'She asked if he could call her a taxi to Hanley, and if she could step inside the flat to wait.

'She made small talk. The gentleman wasn’t comfortable with it and managed to usher her out, but then noticed his mobile phone, watch and wallet had gone from his bureau.'

The serial offender, who has 24 convictions for 73 offences, then went to another flat - the home of a 78-year-old woman.

Miss Chamberlin told the court: 'She said she was looking for her uncle who lived in another flat. They chatted for 10 minutes and the victim offered to help her find him.

'After going to another flat they returned and the defendant used the victim’s phone to call a taxi. They both went outside to wait for it.

'It was not until the next morning that the victim noticed her handbag had been stolen.'

Thieving Podmore was arrested after a police officer recognised her on CCTV footage from the property.

The court heard she also targeted the home of an 89-year-old woman in Bentilee, Staffs., on September 17, again asking the victim to call a taxi for her.

Podmore was invited in and asked for a glass of water and the victim then discovered her in a bedroom and asked her to leave.

She also burgled the bungalow of a 67-year-old man with mobility problems in Longton, Staffs., after looking through his window and spotting him asleep in an arm chair.

The victim woke at 4am to find his wallet and mobile phone had been stolen.

The court heard she also stole a basket of shopping from Asda on August 29, and threatened to stab a staff member with a syringe when he challenged her.

Podmore, of Normacot, Staffs., pleaded guilty to two charges of burglary, three thefts and possessing a bladed article - all of which were committed while she was on bail.

The court heard she had a ‘considerable’ criminal record, with 24 convictions for 73 offences involving drugs, dishonesty and prostitution.

Robert Smith, defending, said: 'She committed the offences to fund her alcohol and drug addiction.'She is utterly and thoroughly ashamed of herself.'

Jailing her for five years, Judge Paul Glenn told her: 'This would have been a traumatic experience for all your victims.

'Elderly people are often left feeling unsafe in their own homes as a result of offences like these.

'It’s quite plain the only person you think about is yourself.'
