The majority of the American workplace is either indifferent or downright hateful about their job--and fancy perks and benefits doesn't help.

Only 30 per cent of employees are engaged and inspired at their jobs, according to a survey of more than 150,000 full- and part-time workers in 2012 for Gallup's 2013 State of the American Workplace Report. While this is a 2 per cent increase from 2010, begrudging and disgruntled employees still make up 18 per cent of the workforce—and cost the U.S. up to $550 billion in lost productivity, CNBC reported.

'These employees, who have bosses from hell that make them miserable, roam the halls spreading discontent,' explains Gallup CEO Jim Clifton in the report.

The rest of workers surveyed are completely indifferent about their work or 'actively disengaged', as Clifton put it. In other terms, these employees don't hate their work, but they aren't reaching their full potential either.

In an effort to boost morale, many companies offer extensive perks to their employees. Google, which has graced the top of several best companies to work for, has unlimited free food and drink, nap pods and massage chairs at its California headquarters.

Management consultant Bob Nelson, author of '1,501 Ways to Reward Employees', told CNBC these benefits are alluring to new workers.

'They're often looking for things they can brag about to their peers,' Nelson said.

But the Gallup report said that employee engagement has a better impact on worker's well being and productivity than these benefits.

'At the end of the day, an intrinsic connection to one's work and one’s company is what truly drives performance, inspires discretionary effort, and improves well being,' the report says.

This sentiment is echoed by several experts, including Randy Allen, the associate dean of Cornell University's Samuel Curtis Johnson Graduate School of Management.

'There's a lot of research out there that says, although it depends on the employee, the perks come out as less important as job satisfaction,' Allen said.

Having a satisfying job, a manager you respect and job growth opportunities is more important, Allen said.

'If you don't have those fundamentals, the perks aren't going to fix it,' he said. 'You may keep them for a while, but at some point they're going to leave.'

The average Millennial or 20-something plan to stay at work for less than three years, making 'job hopping' the new normal with the younger workforce, according to Forbes. Average workers stay with a company for at least four years before moving on.

Data from Glassdoor.com, a job and career community site, showed that salary was still important in job satisfaction, along with workplace culture, CNBC reported.

In it's report, Gallup notes that smaller companies and those that allow employees to work remotely have shown increased job productivity. Communication, holding managers accountable and developing further learning opportunities is key, according to Gallup.

The report notes that workers in professions, such as healthcare and education, are more engaged than average workers, because their jobs reflect their interests.

Americans who hate their jobs could perhaps learn something from such workers, as well as Chinese philosopher Confucius:

'Choose a job you love, and you will never have to work a day in your life.'
