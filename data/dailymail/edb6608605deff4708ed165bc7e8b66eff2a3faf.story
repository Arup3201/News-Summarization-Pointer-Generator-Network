A Brooklyn woman who was overdue in her pregnancy and her husband were able to successfully deliver their baby daughter into the world this week ... on the backseat of an Uber car.

Zanna Gilbert, 34, an art historian at New York's Museum of Modern Art, woke up around 5am Monday with contractions.

Her husband, David Horvitz, 33, opened the Uber app on his phone and saw there was a car available just five minutes from their apartment in Crown Heights.

The couple told their driver Germaine Allen, 32, to take them to Mount Sinai Hospital on Manhattan's Upper East Side, about 12 miles from their home.

However, just a few blocks from the hospital, it became apparent they were not going to make it.

Happy family: Zanna Gilbert went into labor in the back of an Uber car en route to the hospital Monday morning. Her husband, David Horvitz, delivered their daughter Ela on the backseat 

Rider onesie: Following the dramatic birth, Uber paid for the driver's car to be cleaned and sent both the driver and the couple gifts. The latter received an Uber onesie for Ela 

'Zanna was in labor, but we didn't realize it - we thought she was in pre-labor, so we thought, ''We'll go to the hospital now'',' Horvitz, an artist, told Artnet News.

'Zanna told me later that she had the urge to push, but she didn't want to freak anyone out. 

'Then she said, ''I think I'm going to have the baby now''.

'It's blurry after that, but I remember picking up the baby. 

'I caught it when it was coming out, but it was dark, so I didn't know it was coming out.'

Ela Melanie was born on 57th Street and Park Avenue.

She weighed in at seven pounds.

According to The New York Post, the driver, Allen, who had pulled over, drove on to the hospital, and Gilbert and the baby was rushed into emergency. 

'I just kept telling the driver I was sorry,' Horvitz told The Post.

'But he said, ''Don't worry, that was amazing!'''

Horvitz posted a picture to his Twitter of the Uber car where the birth occurred, along with the caption: 'have you ever delivered a baby in the backseat of an @uber ? i have.'

Uber paid to have Allen's car cleaned.

They also sent Allen, who is a father-to-be himself, tickets to see the Knicks, and the new parents a onesie for Ela with 'Uber Rider' on it.

'This is one of those only-in-New-York stories,' Josh Mohrer, a general manager for Uber in New York, told The Post.

'As a new dad myself, I am thrilled to send our best wishes to the happy family, and especially to the new Uber baby.'
