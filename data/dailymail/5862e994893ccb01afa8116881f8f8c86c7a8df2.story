Iain Duncan Smith has spent nearly four years bearing down on the benefits bill in an attempt to make work pay

The welfare budget is to be capped at just under £120billion next year and will then rise only in line with inflation to stop the benefits bill spiralling out of control.

As George Osborne seeks to make further benefit cuts a central election dividing line with Labour, MPs will vote next week on a new system to restrict the amount the state can spend on handouts.

From next year, the new limit will include housing benefit, tax credits, disability benefits and pensioner benefits, although the state pension and jobseeker’s allowance will be excluded.

Governments will have to respond to any breach of the cap by cutting welfare in what the Chancellor describes as a ‘limit on the nation’s credit card’.

The Conservatives and Liberal Democrats have agreed to cap welfare at £119.5billion next year, rising with forecast inflation to £126.7billion by 2018/19 – a real terms freeze in the next parliament.

The Chancellor is understood to want to go further and cut billions more from the welfare budget if the Tories remain in power after the next election.

Work and Pensions Secretary Iain Duncan Smith has spent nearly four years bearing down on the benefits bill in an attempt to make work pay. He is currently rolling out the Universal Credit – a major reform which aims to end the so-called dependency culture.

The Treasury says the welfare cap is designed to prevent repeats of the increase in incapacity benefit claims under the Conservative governments of the 1980s and 1990s, and the surge in housing benefit under Labour.

It is also designed to try to bind Labour’s hands by building structural limits into welfare which makes up a huge proportion of government spending.

The Coalition will introduce a law requiring a Commons vote to be held if the cap is breached and the Government does not want to respond by cutting spending. An incoming Labour government would be free to set a higher cap at the start of the next parliament, but would have to change the law if it wanted to unpick it altogether.

Shadow Chancellor Ed Balls indicated last night that Labour would support the proposal – posing questions over which benefits it would cut to enable it to restore the spare room subsidy for council house tenants, a reform it calls a ‘bedroom tax’. Reversing housing benefit reductions for tenants with unused rooms would mean a £465million welfare spending rise in 2015-16. Labour has said it would remove the winter fuel allowance from better-off pensioners, but this would save only £105million a year.

Mr Balls said: ‘We’ve supported the idea of a welfare cap, we’ve said that we should keep out the basic pension but include pensioner benefits. Clearly we’ll do things differently from the Government, for example we said we’ll abolish the bedroom tax.

‘We actually think that our measures on housing and on young people and jobs can get the wider bill down.’

Mr Osborne said that under Labour spending on welfare was ‘out of control’, with the number of people who have never worked doubling in a decade.

He said the state pension was being excluded from the cap because it would not be right to hit ‘those who’ve worked hard all their lives because the costs on, say, housing benefit for young people had got out of control’.

Treasury sources said the inclusion of particular benefits in the cap did not rule out a political pledge to protect them.

Other benefits included in the cap and therefore potentially vulnerable to being cut back include incapacity benefits, carer’s allowance, maternity allowance and employment support allowance.

The Thatcherite think tank the Centre for Policy Studies welcomed the reform, but added: ‘The Chancellor should also look to increase the scope of the welfare cap and consider whether it really does need to rise in line with inflation.’

Dot Gibson, general secretary of the National Pensioners Convention, said: ‘Pensioners will be concerned that benefits such as the winter fuel allowance, cold weather payments and the Christmas bonus have all been placed into the welfare cap, which could lead to cuts in the future.’

A new £42million research institute to develop the next generation of computer masterminds will be dedicated to  wartime codebreaker Alan Turing.

The centre will aim to make Britain a world leader in analysing large sets of data using huge computing power.

George Osborne said the Alan Turing Institute for Data Science would be founded in honour of a man ‘who was persecuted for his sexuality by the  country he helped to save’.

Turing, who is widely seen as the father of modern computing, was pivotal in cracking the Enigma codes used by the German navy to send secret messages during the Second World War.

With fellow codebreakers at Bletchley Park in Buckinghamshire, he is credited with shortening the war by up to two years and saving countless lives.

But in 1952 he was convicted of gross indecency for having a homosexual  relationship with a 19-year-old Manchester man.

At that time homosexuality was illegal, and he chose to be chemically castrated with injections of female hormones rather than go to jail.

The conviction meant that he lost his security clearance and had to stop the work that had proved vital to the Allies.

He died two years later, aged 41, of cyanide poisoning in an apparent suicide.

He was granted a posthumous Royal Pardon in December after a request by Justice Minister Chris Grayling following a long campaign.

At the time, Baroness Trumpington – who worked with the mathematician at Bletchley Park – said we could have lost the war had it not been for his work.

She said: ‘I really am very pleased. We knew the work he was doing at Bletchley Park was great. Without him, we could have lost the war. Our submarines were being sunk at the rate of knots.’

The institute will research methods of collecting and analysing big sets of data.
