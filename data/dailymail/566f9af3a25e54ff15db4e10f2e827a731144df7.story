As temperatures rise across the U.S. and send people scurrying indoors to their air-conditioned homes, one man is doing things a little differently.

Stan Cox of Salina, Kansas, where it is currently a boiling 109F, does not use air-conditioning even though he has got it in his home.

Mr Cox, 54, says he saves money and the environment by keeping the air-conditioning switched off - and he rarely breaks into a sweat.

Cool: Stan Cox of Salina, Kansas, where it is currently 109F, does not use air-conditioning at the home he shares with his wife even though they've got it

Mr Cox and his wife, Priti, use tricks in their home taught to them by older generations that help them to avoid overheating, reported ABC News.

Mr Cox grew up without air-conditioning in Georgia and claims people have lost the social interaction on summer evenings they had in the past.

‘You'd see kids playing up and down the streets, people visiting one another on their front porches,’ he told ABC News.

‘Now the only sounds you hear are compressors running. Neighbourhoods look like they've been evacuated.’

More than 140 million Americans across 32 states are currently under heat advisories as the U.S. experiences a widespread heatwave.

But agricultural scientist and author Mr Cox claims that by turning on your air-conditioning you’re actually making things worse.

Not in my house: Mr Cox claims home air conditioning accounts for 60 per cent of electricity use in the South and he saves around $150 per month by not using it

‘The headline irony here is that the hotter it gets in summer, the more we're using our a/c,’ he told ABC News.

‘The more we're doing that, the greater the emissions from power plants and probability we'll have even more intense heat waves in the future.’

He has already put forward this view in a piece for the Washington Post last July, which resulted in a postbag of hate mail and even death threats.

Mr Cox claims home air conditioning accounts for 60 per cent of electricity use in the South and he saves around $150 per month by not using it.

The average U.S. household spends more than $275 per year on air-conditioning although local costs vary significantly.

He also believes there would be a fall in obesity if children and adults were to spend more time outdoors and be more active.

Mr Cox claims a Japanese study found air conditioning cuts down on cortisol production by the adrenal glands, which gets you out of bed.
