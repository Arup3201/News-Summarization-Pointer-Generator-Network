Celebrity chef Pete Evans has gone on another rant this week and attacked the the Heart Foundation for the use of its trademark Tick on many everyday supermarket products. 

The My Kitchen Rules judge, who is now a convert to the Paleo diet and based in Sydney, has questioned why the red tick appears on many products like frozen pizzas and kids chocolate breakfast cereal which don't appear to be healthy and good for the heart.

The Tick appears on products like Milo chocolate cereal, Praise mayonnaise, Crisco vegetable oil, McCain Pizza Singles, Tablelands canola spread and extra light Philadelphia cream cheese.

The paleo diet, which Evans is a supporter of, bans all types of dairy and grains, but promotes meat, eggs, vegetables and natural oils

Peter Evans has joined a campaign on Facebook for the well known Heart Foundation Tick to be dropped from certain foods 

Many supermarket products across Australia include the Heart Foundation Tick 

The Heart Foundation says these products are 'designed to help guide consumers' towards making healthier choices when they are shopping and deciding on what products to purchase 

The 41-year-old took to his Facebook page to say: 'I am wondering, how does a someone get 'the Heart Foundation' to put a TICK on their product?

'Is 'The Heart Foundation' paid by multi national [sic] food corporations to have their TICK put onto their products or do they do it for voluntarily? 

'How can this organisation publicly attack a way of life that is helping families reclaim their health in the most natural way possible?'

A storm erupted on social media when Mr Evans posted this picture of a ham and pineapple pizza with the Tick on it 

The television presenter and author got into disagreement with the Dietitians Association of Australia (DAA) over the merits of the Paleo diet last week and now the row has escalated to include the Heart Foundation tick. 

He was also slammed for a 2100 post on Facebook which claimed that the Paleo diet can prevent autism.  

The outspoken celebrity's latest Facebook post came after Barbara Eden from the Heart Foundation said in a Ten Eyewitness News report people who solely eat a Paleo diet 'are putting their heart health at risk'. 

She said: 'They're putting their heart health at risk... we know that high levels of saturated fat in a diet increase people's risk of heart disease. 

Mr Evans now lives on a Paleo diet which has been described as 'caveman diet' and going back to basics

The diet controversially cuts out gluten, grains, dairy, sugar and preservatives 

The Heart Foundation has warned against adopting the diet long term and says people need a balanced diet

'And the second thing we're concerned about I think is the fact that this particular diet doesn't include all food groups.' 

The paleo diet encourages a high intake of meat, and cuts out gluten, grains, dairy, sugar and preservatives. 

The Heart Foundation has warned against adopting the diet long term and says people need to eat a balanced diet. 

Evans wants people to sign a petition by Jessie Reimers from Brisbane called Boycott the Tick #heartfoundationpetition. 

Ms Reimers has over 32,000 signatures and says the Heart Foundation should stop giving advice and promoting food that causes heart disease. 

In Evan's book on Paleo eating he shares his favourite recipes for good health and vitality 

Heart Foundation National CEO Mary Berry said the organisation encourages people to eat a healthy balanced diet that comprises of a wide variety of fresh foods everyday.  

She explained the Tick is 'designed to help guide consumers' towards making healthier choices while they are shopping.

'The reality is that millions of Australians shop in supermarkets everyday and Tick recognises that when it comes to food, many people choose packaged foods, so the Tick is designed to help guide consumers towards a healthier product while they’re standing in the supermarket isle. 

'These small simple changes can make a big difference to a family’s health.'To be eligible to carry the Tick, packaged foods must meet strict nutrition standards, including a combination of lower saturated fat, trans fat, salt and kilojoules, and higher fibre, calcium, wholegrain, fruits and vegetables, than other products of the same type.

'This means that when choosing a food that carries the Tick, shoppers can be confident they are selecting one of the healthier foods of that type.

'Every single product must meet strict nutritional standards to obtain Tick approval. Foods are independently analysed to ensure they meet nutrient criteria before they receive the Tick,' she added.

Four years ago Mr Evans wrote a book with the Heart Foundation called Cooking with Heart in which he used some of the Tick approved products. 

He says he was 'thrilled and honoured'  to do the book but it wasn't until three years ago he looked at his own health and started researching new information on food. 

He told Daily Mail Australia: 'I believe the Heart Foundation stands for something noble and I want to continue to support the work they do in the community.

'However I believe as do a lot of medical experts that the heart tick should be removed from quite a few products that contain an excess of added sugars, numbers and other questionable items that are marketed to children and the general public.

'I would like to work with the heart foundation and supply them with recipes that is backed up by current non bias research.'
