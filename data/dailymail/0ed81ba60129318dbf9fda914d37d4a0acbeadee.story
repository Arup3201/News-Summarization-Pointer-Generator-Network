Republicans John McCain and Lindsey Graham have condemned the deal brokered by the U.S. and Russia over Syria's chemical weapons, saying it is 'morally and strategically indefensible'.

The members of the Senate Armed Services Committee warned the Obama administration was being led into a deal by Vladimir Putin and Syria's dictator, Bashar Assad.

Their criticism came hours after the two countries announced a deal on how to neutralize Syria's chemical weapons arsenal.

Critics: Senators John McCain and Lindsey Graham say the deal with Russia is 'meaningless'

'It requires a willful suspension of disbelief to see this agreement as anything other than the start of a diplomatic blind alley,' the senators said in a joint statement, according to CNN.

They went on to call the agreement, which requires Syria to produce an inventory of its weapons within a week, 'meaningless'.

Assad's regime will also be required to allow international inspectors in before November, as part of a deal seen as a way to limit U.S. involvement in the bloody civil war.

Senators McCain and Graham have pushed for a harder line over Assad's alleged use of chemical weapons, in an attack that killed more than 1,400 people on August 21.

They have called on the U.S. to provide more arms to moderate opposition groups, adding 'this agreement does nothing to resolve 
the real problem in Syria ... [Assad] can go on 
slaughtering innocent civilians'.

In the joint statement they said President Obama's weak response showed the U.S. was losing influence abroad, adding: 'We cannot imagine a worse signal to send to Iran as it continues its push for a nuclear weapon.'

However, the chairman of the Armed 
Services Committee has described the deal as being 'significant 
progress' and said it could achieve a 'better outcome than the goals of the authorization approved just a few days ago'.

Democratic
senator Carl Levin added that the deal still allowed for a military 
response and that President Obama 'remains prepared to act'.

Under the deal, announced on Saturday, Syria must hand over a complete list of its estimated 1,000 tons of chemical 
weapons within a week, leading to their complete destruction in the 
first half of 2014 in the deal agreed by US Secretary of State John 
Kerry and Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov.

Assad
will be told to give full access to international weapons inspectors as
they search for stockpiles of deadly substances such as sarin – which 
experts believe caused more than 1,400 deaths in an attack on Damascus 
last month.

Speaking in Geneva, Mr Kerry said: ‘There can be no games, no room for avoidance, or anything less than full compliance.’

Britain's Foreign Secretary William Hague welcomed the agreement and called on Russia to ensure the success of the deal. 

‘The international community, including Russia, must hold the regime to account. 

'The priority must now be a full and prompt implementation of the agreement,’ he said.

Syrian opposition groups have also criticized the deal, calling it a stalling measure.

General Salim Idriss, who is based in northern Syria, pledged to continue fighting Assad’s regime.

The UK has been providing non-lethal aid to these groups including satellite phones, radios and body armour.

The deal, secured after three days of negotiations, included an agreement of the extent of Syria’s chemical weapons arsenal.

President Assad’s billionaire uncle was yesterday facing corruption charges in Paris relating to his property empire. 

Rifaat
al-Assad, 76, the ‘Butcher of Hama’ who allegedly ordered the massacre 
of 25,000 people in 1982, has homes in France, Britain and Spain. He is 
accused of embezzlement and money-laundering within an organised gang. 

According
to a complaint lodged by anti-corruption groups: ‘It is likely that 
some or all of the assets of Rifaat al-Assad are the product of acts of 
corruption.’

It estimated Assad holds about 1,000 tons of chemical agents and precursors. Details of these must be provided by September 21.

Their removal will be supervised by the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW). 

Teams
of UN and OPCW inspectors are expected to begin their searches in 
November, with the Syrian regime responsible for their security.

The US and Russia remain divided over military action should Assad fail to comply.

At
yesterday’s press conference, Lavrov insisted that the agreement 
reached with  the US ‘said nothing about the use of force, all 
violations should be approved by the Security Council’.
