While most of us will happily splash out on a deluxe kitchen or the perfect leather chesterfield, decorating the humble toilet is often overlooked when it comes to home improvements.

But if you've been neglecting your loo, then you might be missing a trick as these incredible pictures show. From the toilet that cleans itself to the £3 million bling bog encrusted with jewels, it seems that not everyone is happy with a lick of paint and a porcelain potty when it comes to decorating the lavatory.

Among the eye catching examples is a space toilet, complete with a vacuum flush that pulls waste away from the astronaut's body, The intergalactic privy, which is to be found at Tokyo's Engineering Museum of Innovation, also has a royal fan in the shape of the Prince of Wales who inspected it during a visit to Japan in 2008.

Bling: This Hong Kong bathroom is made from solid gold and the toilet alone is worth £3million. Visitors have to wear shoe coverings to avoid scratching the golden floor

Handy: The Parisian 'Sanisette' toilet disinfects itself after every use while Monica Bonvinci's effort allows you to poo while enjoying the surrounding view

Although the Far East leads the way when it comes to eye catching toilets, courtesy of one Hong Kong store's £3million gold toilet encrusted with jewels, there are plenty of creative commodes closer to home.

Across the Channel in Paris is the Sanisette, a self-cleaning public 
restroom. After a patron exits the restroom, a 60-second wash cycle begins inside the toilet, and the toilet fixture itself is
 scrubbed and disinfected automatically.

In London, the most striking entry into the toilet hall of fame is architect Monica Bonvicini's spectacular creation made from one-way glass which sits outside the Chelsea College of Art and Design.

Initially intended for use in prisons, the designer bog lets you take in your surroundings while dealing with your bodily necessities in peace. Another technically advanced throne is the 'Egg Pod' toilet found in the bathroom of London restaurant, Sketch.

Guests at the celebrity hangout can climb into little egg shaped capsules in order to complete their business. But though the eggs look high tech, they aren't a patch on the Sega 'Toylets' found in Tokyo.

Hidden: Despite the glass walls (and the ability to see out), Bonvinci's bog is made from one way glass which means that passersby definitely (we hope) can't see in

Out of this world: This space toilet, complete with a special vacuum, was seen by Prince Charles during a visit to the Engineering Museum of Innovation in Tokyo

Totally potty! Tokyo's 'Toylets' have pressure sensors at the back which allow users to play urine operated video games while carrying out their personal business

The unusual urinals come complete with games that you play by accurately aiming urine at a pressure sensor located at the back of the urinal. The four games include 'Graffiti Eraser', which enables the toilet goes to use their 
stream to erase graffiti on a wall and 'Mannekin Pis' - named for the Brussels landmark - that measures 
how much urine has been expelled.

In 'The North Wind and the Sun and Me', 
 the strength of the urine stream produced determines how much a virtual
 girl's skirt gets blown up by the wind. Finally, in 'Battle: Milk from 
Nose' the user has to try and beat the previous urinator's stream 
strength.

In addition to its bling bog, Hong Kong also boasts urinals with entertainment included, although the former British colony has chosen not to offer video games, instead plumping for TV shows.

Back in Japan, there's also an underwater toilet built into the side of an aquarium in Akashi as well as a toilet that simulates the feeling of taking off from a ski jump at the Madarao-Kogen hotel in Iiyama City.

Scary though the ski jump commode might prove for some, nothing is more likely to induce bowel-loosening terror than Mexico's bottomless bathroom.

Located at the top of the 15-storey PPDG Penthouse in Guadalajara, the toilet is perched atop an open lift shaft and was built, according to architects Hernandez Silva Arquitectos, with 'concepts of transparency and the simplicity of materials' in mind.

Terrifying: Guadalajara's bottomless bog overlooks a 15-storey drop, making Sketch's 'Egg Pod' toilets look positively benign by comparison

Slippery slope: The toilet at the Madarao-Kogen hotel in Japan's Iiyama City makes you feel as if you're atop a mountain and ready to tackle a scary ski jump

High tech: While you can't play games with them, the public urinals in Hong Kong's APM shopping mall do come complete with individual televisions to entertain you
