A 61-year-old homeowner revealed today how oversleeping by 10 minutes saved his life after a Royal Mail lorry smashed into his house.

Len Wiles, of Gosport, Hampshire, said he usually goes downstairs at 5.45am and switches on the TV - but he did not get out of bed at the normal time yesterday after having a bad night's sleep.

The former aircraft company worker and his wife Anne, 66, had to be rescued from the upper floor of their Â£160,000 home after the 7.5-tonne lorry crashed into the property at 5.47am yesterday.

Crash: Len and Anne Wiles had to be rescued from the upper floor of their home in Gosport, Hampshire after a 7.5 tonne Royal Mail lorry crashed into their property at around 5.45am yesterday

Destroyed: The driver of the lorry was checked over by paramedics at the scene, but is not thought to have been seriously injured in the impact. Mr and Mrs Wiles were left shocked but uninjured

Accident: It is thought the driver of the Royal Mail lorry lost control of his vehicle and smashed into three parked cars before crashing through a small brick wall (both pictured right) and ploughing into the building

Mr Wiles told the Daily Mirror: 'I usually go down at 5.45am and switch on the TV. But I had a bad night's sleep. If I had gone down like normal, I'd be dead.'

A fireman asked the couple if they were 'expecting a parcel' when he arrived to rescue them.

It is thought the driver of the Royal Mail lorry lost control of his vehicle and smashed into three parked cars before crashing through a brick wall and ploughing into the building.

Describing the moment the firefighter 
arrived at the property, Mr Wiles said: 'The fireman poked his head 
through the window and said, "Were you expecting a parcel?".'

Hampshire Fire and Rescue Service said they were alerted to the crash on the busy Brockhurst Road at 5.47am yesterday.

Mr
 and Mrs Wiles, who had recently agreed to sell the property after 
moving in when it was built last October, were left shocked but 
uninjured. They are now hoping the buyer will not pull out.

Risk: The building was so badly damaged that neighboruing homes were temporarily evacuated due to a fear the property could fall down

A Royal Mail lorry caused serious damage to the outside and inside of the house, meaning a vast reconstruction effort to the Hampshire home

'I'm hoping our buyer can hang on until the house is repaired - it's a beautiful house,' Mr Wiles said.

The driver of the lorry was checked 
over by paramedics at the scene, but was not thought to have been 
seriously injured in the impact.

Mrs Wiles said: 'We were fast asleep 
in bed when suddenly we heard a great big explosion and a crash. We 
thought there had been an accident outside on the road.

'My
 husband jumped out of bed and went out onto our landing. There was a 
gaping hole where the stairs were and the front of the lorry was embedded in it.'

Neighbour Nicola Dugan, 42, said: 'At about 5.45am I heard a massive bang, it was so loud it was like a bomb had gone off.

While the damage is extremely extensive, Len Wiles is glad that he stayed in bed, as it managed to save his life from the lorry which crashed through his front room

The lorry caused a gaping hole where the stairs were, and has meant that the load bearing parts of the house were ripped out

'I put on my pyjamas and rolled out of bed and saw a giant Royal Mail red lorry inside my next door neighbour's house.

'Our front door has been damaged as well as our gas pipe, because Len's car was pushed into our house,' she added. 'But the main thing is Les and Anne are 
fine - it's a miracle.

'He is retired and even said to me he woke up 10
 minutes later than he normally did. If he had woken up then, he would 
have been in the front room and would have been in trouble.'

Mrs
 Dugan said she noticed the male Royal Mail delivery driver, who she 
thought was in his 50s, appeared 'dazed and shocked' after the crash.

Mr Wiles said his life was saved because he had decided to stay in bed for an extra 10 minutes, as on every other weekday he would have been on the ground floor of the building at that time

The Royal Mail driver had a lucky escape as it was passenger side of the lorry that felt the worst of the impact

Worry: Mr and Mrs Wiles, who had recently agreed to sell the property after moving in when it was built last October, were left shocked but uninjured. They are now hoping the buyer will not pull out.

'[He] said he had no idea what happened... He was wearing a full uniform including his full high-vis yellow coat, with the Royal Mail logo,' she added.

'I looked out of my window and saw Len upstairs, he was shocked, he looked scared,' Ms Dugan said. 'He shouted that he was okay and even said, "We've only just sold the house - what are we going to do?".'

A
 fire service spokesman said: 'The lorry crashed into the property 
cutting off the staircase leaving two people trapped upstairs in the 
house.

'Firefighters used an aerial ladder platform to rescue the people from the first floor of the house.'

Unstable: The house and neighbouring properties were initially evacuated as it was feared the semi-detached property could fall down when the lorry was removed

Neighbour Nicola Dugan said the 'massive bang' was so loud that she initially thought a bomb had gone off

Stuck: A fire service spokeswoman said: 'The lorry crashed into the property cutting off the staircase leaving two people trapped upstairs in the house

The officer in charge, Paul Coates, said:
 'Our crews were on scene quickly and worked hard to reassure and rescue
 the two people who were trapped on the first floor of the property.'

A Hampshire Constabulary spokesman confirmed that the lorry driver and the occupants of the house were uninjured.

Hampshire Fire and Rescue Service's Urban Search and Rescue team were called to the scene to assess structural damage to the property.

The house and neighbouring properties were evacuated as it was initially feared the semi-detached property could fall down when the lorry was removed.
