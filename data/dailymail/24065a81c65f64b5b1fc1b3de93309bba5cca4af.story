Sudden illness: Fiona Davies was eventually diagnosed with lupus

When 29-year-old Fiona Davies noticed that her socks were getting tighter in April this year, she thought she must have put on a little weight.

'But after a few days I realised that both feet and my ankles and calves were actually swollen, so I booked to see my GP,' says the trainee veterinary nurse from Northamptonshire.

Blood and urine tests suggested that her kidneys were malfunctioning, so she was referred to see a nephrologist - a kidney specialist - a month later.

However, before she could see the consultant the swelling started to spread upwards to her thighs. Fiona also began to feel desperately tired. 'I have a very active job, and was also playing badminton and doing gymnastics and  yoga,' she says.

'But I started struggling to keep these up. One night I came home from badminton in a lot of pain - my whole body ached and my limbs felt heavy. Eventually I stopped going altogether. No amount of sleep seemed to make anything better.'

Fiona struggled on, but three days before she was due to see the nephrologist she became seriously ill. 'I spent all day out in the sun with my boyfriend, Steve. By 4pm I felt awful - feverish, achy and off my food. Then I started vomiting  and Steve insisted on taking me to A&E.'

At the hospital she underwent tests - doctors also commented on a rash across her nose and cheeks. 'I thought it was just an outbreak of red spots - I'd had them for a couple of weeks but apparently it was called a butterfly rash,' she says.

What Fiona didn't know was that this rash is a characteristic symptom of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), also known simply as lupus - an autoimmune disorder in which the body starts attacking itself. It affects 50,000 people in the UK.

Fiona was diagnosed with a specific form, lupus nephritis, which meant that it was attacking her kidneys.

'I was aware of the illness as I'd seen it on the TV show Embarrassing Bodies,' she says.

'All I could remember was that the guy on the show had been in a lot of pain and found life very difficult. It was shocking to be told this was what I had - I'd been perfectly healthy just weeks before and now I had an incurable illness. All I could think was, “What have I done to deserve this?”'

Primary symptoms: Signs of lupus normally include fatigue, skin rash and joint pain and swelling

Lupus causes the immune system to turn on itself and start attacking healthy cells, organs and tissues - it's not known why. Ninety per cent of sufferers are women, and it generally starts between the ages of 20 and 50 - although in about 20 per cent of people it begins in childhood, usually around puberty, so it's thought that hormones may play a part in its onset. It affects certain groups much more than others - one white woman in 5,000 gets it, yet one Afro-Caribbean woman in 625 is affected.

The main symptoms are fatigue, skin rash and joint pain/swelling.

'While it is incurable, it can be successfully treated with medications,' says Dr John Ioannou, consultant in adolescent and adult rheumatology at University College London Hospital.

'People with lupus tend to have flare-ups where their symptoms can be severe and debilitating, then the illness can go into remission. They can then live for months or even years between flare-ups, where they feel well.

'Medications stop the flare-ups or accelerate their resolution, and most patients respond to them.'

Fiona was treated with intravenous steroids in hospital to reduce the inflammation, and discharged after ten days with a cocktail of drugs, including heavy doses of the steroid prednisolone to continue reducing inflammation, a diuretic to help banish the excess fluid and an immunosuppressant.

She may need to take some of these drugs for the rest of her life, but will be able to reduce or stop others depending on how she responds.

'In the following weeks I felt incredibly weak,' says Fiona. 'My weight plummeted and I ended up back in hospital four times with various problems caused by the lupus, such as gastritis (inflammation of the stomach lining). I could barely walk and lived and slept downstairs for a couple of months because walking up stairs would wipe  me out. The fatigue was so  physically and emotionally overwhelming - the best way I can describe it is that it felt painful to be awake.

'Steve was amazing, and stayed calm and strong. My employers were incredibly understanding, too - I had been just about to take my practical exams to qualify as a veterinary nurse, but had to put that on hold.'

Five months later the medications seem to be working. Fiona has regular blood tests and her kidney function is back to normal. She still gets tired easily and rarely goes out to socialise, but she has managed to go back to work for two-and-a-half hours a day, three days a week.

'The fatigue was so physically and 
emotionally overwhelming - the best way I can describe it is that it 
felt painful to be awake.'

As with most lupus patients, however, it can be difficult to predict when the illness will  flare up again.

'The cause of flare-ups is unknown,' says Dr Ioannou, 'but there are things that can be done to help prevent them. Excessive exposure to sunlight should be avoided at all times, even in winter, as it can trigger a flare-up.'

This is thought to be because sun exposure causes higher cell turnover, which in turn releases genetic materials into the blood - these materials are not tolerated by people with lupus.

Monique Francois, 32, from London, has been on a roller-coaster of flare-ups since she was diagnosed at 25, when she was on holiday.

'I was in St Lucia visiting relatives when I started feeling odd,' she says. 'My jet lag wouldn't wear off and I became really out of breath when walking, which was unusual as I was very fit.

'A few days later I went to the cinema and when I got up to leave, I couldn't move. My feet and lower legs had become  completely immobile and putting my feet on the ground was agonising.'

Monique was carried out and taken home to rest, and the  pain subsided.

But when she got back to the UK, she deteriorated rapidly and her mother took her to A&E.

'I couldn't walk and I'd  stopped eating because I felt so awful. The doctors suspected lupus and the blood tests came back positive.

'A friend of my mum's had lupus, so I knew about the illness. I was terrified and felt like a sitting duck, knowing that it can strike any part of the body at any time without warning.'

Monique had trained to be an actor and was at the beginning of a promising career. But now she found herself having to be cared for 24 hours a day by her mother.

'I couldn't even dress or wash myself,' she recalls. 'I was sleeping my life away because the fatigue was so extreme. I became very depressed and my social life was non-existent. I was a shell of my former bubbly self.'

After her doctors experimented with different combinations of medication without much luck, Monique finally started to improve in late 2011 - four years after the first attack.

But in February 2012 blood results showed that her lupus was becoming active again.

'I'd noticed that I was getting a lot of mouth ulcers, which is a symptom of lupus,' she says. 'Within hours I began vomiting and getting terrible headaches.'

Monique suffered several setbacks over the following year, including the lupus becoming active in her kidneys. However, after intensive treatment with two new drugs she has started to improve and is hoping to set up a lupus support group in her area.

'I realised that I have to learn to love my body as it is now and relearn its capabilities.'

Fiona, too, is facing the illness with a positive attitude.

'I'm so appreciative of the good days I have and the little things that people do for me,' she says.

'There was a point when all I could think about was getting through the next few hours, but now that I'm feeling a little better, I can think about the future again.'
