Prince Charles might be the royal family's best-known gardening fan but it seems he isn't the only one after it was revealed that Prince Harry will take part in next summer's Chelsea Flower Show.

The royal is to present an African-themed garden on behalf of his charity, Sentebale, which supports orphans and vulnerable children living in Lesotho.

But Harry, 30, isn't doing it alone, with garden designer Matt Keightley revealing that Prince Charles has had almost as much input as his son.

Green-fingered: Prince Harry is to take part in next year's Chelsea Flower Show with a charity garden

Charles, who famously once admitted to talking to the plants at his Highgrove estate in Gloucestershire, has taken an advisory role in the design.

2013's Sentebale garden, which was designed by Jinny Blom, was awarded a silver gilt medal but Mr Keightley, 30, hopes to go one better and pick up a gold.

The centrepiece of his garden design will be a building inspired by Sentebale’s new residential facility for children with Aids/HIV that is opening in Lesotho next year.

There will also be a dramatic rocky waterfall which is typical of the rugged terrain of Lesotho, known as the Mountain Kingdom.

The young designer’s garden, which is will cost a six figure sum, is being sponsored by a charitable foundation set up by entrepreneur David Brownlow.

His spokesman Ben Rawson said: 'Prince Charles has the Prince’s Foundation for Building Community, which has worked with Sentebale in Lesotho.

'As patrons of the two charities, both Prince Charles and Prince Harry, have had input into the design of the garden. Prince Charles has a tremendous interest in gardening from the work he has done at Highgrove.

'I think he probably cares more about raising awareness about Lesotho than he does winning a gold medal for the garden.

'But that would be nice for the designer and contractors as recognition of their efforts.'

Rawson, who is commercial director of Brownlow’s investment firm Havisham Group and a trustee of his David Brownlow Charitable Foundation, added: 'Matt’s garden will be Lesotho-themed.

'He cannot use native plants because they would not survive here at that time of year and so he has to use European flowers for the same look.

'This is about trying to give people a window into Lesotho and inspire them to dig into their pockets to help Prince Harry to finish the work he has started out there.'

In a 1986 interview, Charles, who is devoted to environmental issues, famously said: 'I just come and talk to the plants, really - very important to talk to them. They respond.'

He was filmed in 2013 by BBC1’s Countryfile making hedgerows at Highgrove and presenter Julia Bradbury asked if this was something he still did.

The green-fingered heir to the throne joked self-deprecatingly: 'No, now I instruct them instead.'

Charles, 66, visits Chelsea most years, while Harry, 30, attended for the first time in 2013 and gave his father and the Queen a guided tour of his Sentebale garden.

Keightley, who is based in Richmond, south-west London, designed a World War I-themed garden at Chelsea in 2014 for military charity Help for Heroes, which Harry also supports.

It was inspired by the tales of his brother serving five tours of Afghanistan and soldiers wounded serving their country.

His "Hope on the Horizon" garden was in the shape of the Military Cross, the decoration for extreme bravery awarded since 1914, and was also awarded a silver gilt medal by the Chelsea judges.

Keightley, who has been designing since the age of 17, scooped the prestigious People’s Choice award too on his Chelsea debut.

After the show, his entire garden, which included an avenue of hornbeam trees, was rebuilt at a recovery centre run by Help for Heroes in the garrison town of Colchester, Essex.

Keightley said: 'I am honoured to be working with Sentebale, The Prince’s Foundation for Building Community and Prince Harry on this very special garden.

'It is such an inspirational project that I am delighted to be able to help raise awareness of.

'Last year was my first RHS Chelsea Flower Show and to have achieved the silver gilt and the People’s Choice awards for the Hope on the Horizon garden was incredible and I am thrilled to be working once again at the world-famous show and I will be incorporating so many positives of the great work that Sentebale does in the garden design.'

Sentebale chief executive Cathy Ferrier said: 'Matt Keightley has created a truly inspirational garden that will be a representation of the experience that the children in Lesotho go through during our Mamohato camp.

'The garden will give visitors a taste of Lesotho and the bright, vibrant atmosphere of the Mamohato camp and will include a rock waterscape feature, which is representative of the mountainous region.'

A Chelsea insider predicted that the public will love the latest design - putting Keightley on course for a gold medal.

He said: 'Keightley’s garden is a proper show garden that you know visitors will love. The last one got lots of publicity but you didn’t see the crowds looking at it. I think this one will do better.'

Blom’s 'forget-me-not' garden in 2013 boasted willows, pines and a traditional Lesotho round house.

Sentebale means ‘forget-me-not’ in Sesotho, the main language spoken in Lesotho, where the charity, founded by Harry in 2006, works with victims of extreme poverty and Aids/HIV.

Harry emailed her his feedback from Camp Bastion, in Helmand Province, Afghanistan, where he was serving as an Apache helicopter co-pilot.

The Prince’s Foundation for Building Community is a charity dedicated to promoting 'beautiful, harmonious and enduring' urban development using sustainable principles.

It acts as a 'champion', bringing together developers, designers, local authorities and local communities and has advised Sentebale in the design of its new Mamohato Children’s Centre in Lesotho.

The charity confirmed Charles’ involvement in the Chelsea garden but declined to give any details.

Brownlow, who works in the financial services industry, is a trustee of Charles’ Dumfries House in Ayrshire, Scotland and chairman of the Prince’s Foundation for Building Community.

Last year, he donated £1.5 million to fund the restoration of the Dumfries estate’s four and a half acre walled garden.
