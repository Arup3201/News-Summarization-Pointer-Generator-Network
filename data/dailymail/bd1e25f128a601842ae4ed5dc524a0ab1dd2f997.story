Benefits are to rise by almost 50 per cent more than the average wage, sparking another coalition row over curbing increases in handouts.

New inflation figures today showed the rate of inflation fell to 2.2 per cent in September, its lowest level for nearly three years.

But the inflation figure will be used to determine increases in benefits and pensions, and is significantly higher than the 1.5 per cent average annual pay rises which bosses are giving to those in work. Many with jobs have faced pay freezes.

The Consumer Prices Index rate of inflation has been higher than annual pay rises for most of the last two years, which means wages have failed to increase in line with the cost of living

Chancellor George Osborne is expected to hold talks with Work and Pensions Secretary Iain Duncan Smith about changing the way hikes in benefits are determined.

The September inflation figure is used to decide by how much benefits rise.

Whitehall estimates suggest £14billion could have been saved since 2008 if they had risen in line with wages instead of inflation.

The Consumer Prices Index fell to 2.2 per cent in September, down from 2.5 per cent in August and the lowest level since November 2009, the Office for National Statistics.

Work and Pensions Secretary Iain Duncan Smith has made clear he wants to ensure that work always pays more than benefits

Latest figures show average earnings for people in work are up by only 1.5 per cent year-on-year, which means their income is failing to keep pace with the rising cost of living.

Last year CPI was 5.2 per cent, and the Liberal Democrats battled to secure the full rise in benefits.

If benefits had been increased in line with pay rises last year, at 2.5 per cent, it would have saved £5 billion.

Chancellor George Osborne wants to find £10billion in extra savings from the welfare bill, which the Lib Dems are resisting

Lib Dem minister David Laws has highlighted how his party has ‘fought battles on uprating of benefits to make sure people who are poor don't get pushed further into poverty’.

However, with the Tories committed to finding an extra £10billion in savings from the welfare budget, pressure will grow to look again at the way rises are calculated.

Last week Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg rejected the idea of a further raid on benefits.

He said: 'The idea that of that £16billion [welfare budget] we are just going to scoop out £10billion from welfare which will inevitably hit the poorest before asking anything of the wealthiest, no. Flatly no. Of course not.'

While inflation has dropped, gas and electricity rises are expected to push it higher after four of the ‘big six’ energy firms announced price rises.

Mr Osborne is expected to announce the outcome of talks with Mr Duncan Smith on changing the way increases in benefits and pensions are decided.

Today the Treasury said September's fall in the inflation rate would bring 'welcome relief to the budgets of families and businesses'.

Economist Vicky Redwood at Capital Economics said while inflation had fallen close to the Government's two per cent target, the decrease was likely to be 'the last for a while'.

Cathy Jamieson, Labour’s shadow treasury minister, said the drop in flation was welcome, but further hikes in energy and food prices loom in the coming months.

She added: 'Instead of easing the squeeze, the Government is making things even harder for families on low and middle incomes.

'Millions of families and pensioners will be worse off because of the 3p rise in fuel duty and cuts to child benefit in January, and the granny tax which comes in on the same day that millionaires get a tax cut in April.'
