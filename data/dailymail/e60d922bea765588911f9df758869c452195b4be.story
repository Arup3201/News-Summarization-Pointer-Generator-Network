KFC fight: Richard Burbage promised to take her out for a meal if she joined him at a football match

A car dealer got into a row with his wife when he promised to take her out for a meal if she went to a football match with him - then drove her to a Kentucky Fried Chicken restaurant.

Richard Burbage, 41, of Whiteley, Hampshire, then tried to fight an expert in martial arts who attempted to break up the argument.

The father-of-three was convicted of assault and fined £320 for attacking Julian Raffle.

Burbage had been arguing with his wife, Lorraine, in KFC after they had been to a football match on a Sunday afternoon.

The row erupted because Burbage told his wife he would take her out for a meal in exchange for coming to the match with him.

But when she discovered the meal meant being taken to KFC in Hedge End, Hampshire, the couple began arguing.

Dan O’Neill, prosecuting, told magistrates that customers at the eatery became disturbed by the row. He added that customer Mr Raffle then tried to calm the couple down and intervened.

Mr O’Neil said there was then a struggle between Mr Raffle and Burbage - and the  car dealer twice tried to punch him.

But what he did not realise was that Mr Raffle is an expert in the martial art of jiu-jitsu and when Burbage tried to upper cut Mr Raffle, he used his self-defence training to dodge the blows.

Burbage was then arrested and charged with common assault. After admitting this at Southampton Magistrates’ Court, he was fined £200. He also had to pay £100 costs and a £20 victim surcharge.

A separate allegation of assaulting his wife by beating on November 30 was dismissed after the prosecution offered no evidence.

Mark Rigby, defending Burbage, said: ‘He and his wife both describe the relationship as feisty, fiery and passionate.

‘What he did was wrong because he swings for him and he bites off more than he can chew because Mr Raffle is trained in jiu-jitsu.

‘With hindsight they are very embarrassed by what sparked this. She was thinking she would be rewarded with a meal and wasn’t pleased to find out that that meal would be at KFC.

‘I think the salient lesson has been learned by the defendant and his wife.’
