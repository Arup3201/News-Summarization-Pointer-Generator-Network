Justice secretary Ken Clarke has called for the return of free biscuits to cabinet meetings

When you look at the perks they receive - Britain's politicians could already be accused of taking the biscuit.

But the Secretary of State for Justice, Ken Clarke, has nevertheless called for the return of a free supply of the tea-dipping snacks to cabinet meetings.

Mr Clarke let his complaint slip-out during an appearance on the Channel 4 TV show 'Gordon Behind Bars'.

The veteran Conservative politician 
was visiting Brixton Prison as celebrity chef Gordon Ramsay requests 
funding for the 'Bad Boys Bakery' where inmates cook products to sell on
the outside.

As
he was talking to prisoners, Mr Clarke said: ‘I was complaining at 
cabinet this morning that we don’t have biscuits anymore, so I’m looking
forward to a decent lunch.'

He certainly had his fill at the prison as he tucked into lemon slices and steak during the visit.

Asked about Mr Clarke's comment a spokesman for the Ministry of Justice confirmed that the cabinet minister would like to see biscuits back on the table at cabinet meetings 'because he likes them.'

Free biscuits are no longer a feature at the Coalition Government's cabinet meetings

His call appeared to be at odds with the mood of Prime Minister David Cameron who has predicted that austerity in Britain will continue until 2020.

A 10 Downing Street spokesman refused to discuss the issue saying 'we don’t comment on such details.'

The Biscuit Appreciation Society (BAS) is backing Mr Clarke in his bid to get digestives and shortbreads back on the trolley at Number 10.

A BAS spokesman said: 'We are totally behind Ken Clarke on this - they should indeed bring back the biscuits at Cabinet meetings.

'For a start, biscuits are cheap. Secondly, people always get grumpy when they’re removed, usually as part of ridiculous cost-cutting measures.

A spokesman for the Ministry of Justice confirmed Mr Clarke wanted free biscuits to be returned to cabinet meetings 'because he likes them'

'If Cabinet members eat them and feel happy then they or more likely to make effective decisions that will have a beneficial effect on the nation and the economy.'

The spokesman said it was 'short-sighted to scrimp on biscuits' and claimed that research had shown the snacks have 'a positive impact' on meetings.

Nutritional expert Charlotte Watts said that, although biscuits give an immediate energy boost during a long working day, the effects are temporary.

'Biscuits are provided in business meetings as a ‘treat’ and as an immediate sugar high.

'They are so popular in meetings because people think they will get that immediate energy rush from them, but there is no actual health benefits in the long term.’
