The young Royals have been ordered to change their personal email addresses amid growing fears that they are being targeted by online hackers.

Harry, Kate and William, as well as Princesses Beatrice and Eugenie, have been told to make the urgent changes after security officials detected a new threat of corporate and government snooping – most probably coming from Russia – aimed at the Royals.

The younger members of the Royal family are seen as particularly vulnerable because of their use of social media.

And the espionage risk is being taken so seriously that Prince Harry is believed to have also been told he must close down his Facebook page.

The order came after staff at eavesdropping agency GCHQ issued warnings about 'chatter' on the airwaves that prompted suspicion that the Royals have been targeted.

I'm told the threat has been picked up over the past five weeks and comes from hackers looking to expose state secrets and details of multi-million-pound deals, as well as Royal gossip.

It is thought that snoops are offering huge rewards to anyone who can manage to hack into the Royal accounts.

The young Royals have all been warned that just one careless or unguarded remark could be enough to jeopardise lucrative contracts. 

A source told me: 'Younger members of the Royals, Harry, Kate and William, even Beatrice and Eugenie, have been warned they are targets of electronic hackers attempting to intercept their emails.

'They are after any useful information about high-level Government plans that could affect major companies or industries. In the financial world, advance knowledge is worth millions. One slip could cost millions in business.

'And they have been warned to be on guard. They have to report anything strange that pops up immediately.'

The warning has apparently come as quite the shock to the young Royals, who – perhaps naively – had 'no idea' they could be a target.

A threat from closer to home was exposed last year, when Clive Goodman, former Royal Editor at the now defunct News Of The World admitted in court to hacking the phones of William, Kate and Harry almost 200 times.

And when Harry was in Afghanistan, elaborate security precautions had to be put in place so he could communicate with his then girlfriend Cressida Bonas while he was away.

Harry, known as Captain Wales at work, had a specially encrypted 'Batphone' so he could call her without being overheard during his second, 20-week tour that ended in January 2013.

Security issues aside, some of Harry's close friends will be joking that there's another reason behind the change in address.

In typical laddish style, his previous account included the figures '69' – a suggestive allusion to a sexual position and a sure-fire way to raise a few eyebrows.

The NHS could see an unexpected Royal arrival as the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge prepare for the birth of their second baby. 

With Kate living at the couple’s Norfolk estate, Anmer Hall, aides have been sent to check out local hospitals ‘just in case’ she can’t make it to the Lindo Wing at St Mary’s in London in time for the birth next month. 

Among those closest to Anmer Hall is the world-renowned Addenbrooke’s in Cambridge.

‘If there is a sudden emergency in Norfolk and there is no time to get Kate to London, she will go to the nearest hospital,’ reveals an insider. ‘If the nearest one is an NHS hospital, then that’s where the fourth in line to the throne will be born.’
