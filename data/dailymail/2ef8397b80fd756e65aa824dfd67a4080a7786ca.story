A gang member who killed a promising Los Angeles High School football player because he believed the athlete's red Spider-Man backpack linked him to an opposing gang was sentenced to death on Friday.

Pedro Espinoza had told authorities he was willing to kill for his gang, even if it meant going to death row.

Superior Court Judge Ronald H Rose imposed that very sentence - ordering Espinoza be taken to San Quentin State Prison.

Guilty: Gang member Pedro Espinoza sits in a Los Angeles court as he is sentenced to death for the 2008 murder of Jamiel Shaw II

Victim: Jamiel Shaw II, 17, was shot dead because Espinoza believed his red Spider-Man backpack, similar to the one pictured, linked him to an opposing gang

The judge rejected defence arguments that the 23-year-old didn't get a fair trial.

He
said: ‘The evidence is clear he decided to murder the victim in cold 
blood and bragged about the killing after. The defendant executed the 
victim as he lay on the ground defenseless.’

Jamiel Shaw II, 17, was a standout running back when he was gunned down in 2008. He was not a gang member.

His
parents and friends appeared in court on Friday wearing red. They said 
it wasn't to symbolise a gang – but for ‘the blood spilled'.

‘You
don't have a right to execute someone and then come in and plead not to
be executed,’ said Jamiel Shaw Sr, the father of the victim.

Mr Shaw said he devoted his life to preparing his son for a brilliant athletic career.

He said: ‘We really thought we had a chance. My son was groomed to succeed.’

Anita Shaw, a U.S. Army sergeant, told of being in Iraq on her second tour of duty when she was summoned by her commander and told that her son had been murdered.

She said: ‘I lost it.'

She invoked scripture, saying she knew she was supposed to forgive – but ‘I'm not that strong of a person.’

Espinoza didn't move and didn't look at Shaw's parents as they spoke.

The judge noted that Espinoza had been released from jail shortly before the killing on an unrelated charge and had been counseled by an officer who warned him of the consequences of further criminal behaviour.

Rose urged the family to focus on raising their 13-year-old son, Thomas, who also attended the sentencing.

Mr Shaw said outside court he would do that but feels the gang situation has changed parenting.

He said: ‘You're not raising them anymore. You're trying to keep them alive.’
