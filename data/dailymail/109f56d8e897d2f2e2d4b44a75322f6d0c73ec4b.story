A man who was late to return to his parked car by one minute because doctors were telling him that his elderly father had terminal cancer was given a parking ticket.

Kevin Hodges, of  County Durham, attended an appointment at the University Hospital of North Durham for his father Edward, 77, who was suffering lung cancer.

Mr Hodges was expecting to attend a routine appointment on November 20 last year to receive news about his father, who was admitted to hospital five days beforehand.

Kevin Hodges was fined him for overstaying in a car park by just one minute after learning about his father's terminal condition

But at the end of the appointment, a consultant asked to see Kevin especially and gave him the bad news that his father was terminally ill.

Beforehand, HGV driver Mr Hodges believed he had ample time to get back to his car and his parking ticket which was due to expire at 7.11pm.

But as the consultant called him back he faced a wait and was left unable to get back in time.

As he came to terms with the devastating news about his dad, Mr Hodges ran back to the car to put more money in the machine for a new parking ticket, realising it was on the verge of expiring.

He had put £1 in the machine at 6.11pm for an hour's parking at Southfield Way car park in Durham operated by LDK Security Group, which is situated next to the hospital.

But as Mr Hodges returned to his car, he was shocked to find a parking fine slapped on their car for £60 after he arrived - just six minutes after the expiry time.

Mr Hodges says despite pleading wit the operator about the fine, they said he had breached the rules and would not drop it

There is a five minute period of grace on parking times - meaning Mr Hodges was parked illegally for just one minute.

Despite pleas about his circumstances to LDK, Mr Hodges was told the fine still applied.

Mr Hodges, 52, has since been fighting the fine and appealed twice against the charge to no avail.

Mr Hodges claims he received a further blow when he first tried to appeal and LDK claimed he had parked illegally, blocking the main entrance for other vehicles and increased the fine to £90.

However, this offence was dated December 3 2012, almost two weeks after Mr Hodges' parking fine.

It is understood LDK accepted that Mr Hodges was not responsible for the offence on December 3 but refused to rescind the original parking fine, which was then increased to £120 for non-payment with 14 days of the fine being issued.

Mr Hodges said: 'I think it's absolutely disgusting. They should consider showing compassion in light of why I was late back to the car.

'I didn't think I would be late, I thought I'd left ample time, but it was because the consultant called me back to give me the bad news that this happened.

'Then they accused me of parking illegally, which was not true, our car never blocked the main gate but they claimed they had CCTV which proved it.

'The date of that offence was December 3, so it definitely wasn't me.

'I refused to pay, it was the principle, but then I got a letter from a debt collection agency saying I had to pay within seven days, so I had no choice.'

Mr Hodges' father, who was married to Frances, 77, died on November 29 after the couple took him home where he would be more comfortable in his final days.

The former miner, who worked at both Metal Bridge and Whitworth mines, battled cancer after being diagnosed with leukaemia four years ago.

Scott Brunning, the North East area manager for LDK said the fine would not be scrapped.

Mr Brunning said: 'While I fully sympathise with Mr Hodges' circumstances, as I've lost family members through cancer myself, we cannot overturn the ticket because it was in breach of terms and conditions.

'If this was a hospital-controlled car park it would be different, but we have to act on the land owner's behalf, who we operate the car park on behalf of.

'It is not owned by the hospital. It is run by the rules and regulations of the land owner.

'There is a five minute period of grace after a ticket expired, but this had expired.

'I want to point out it is not a personal decision, it is based on the rules.'

Mr Hodges appealed against the ticket through an ombudsman, but last week received a letter saying he had to pay £90 within a week from a debt collection agency.

The car park is not operated or owned by the NHS, but is situated near to the hospital.

He said: 'I've paid it now, but I'm sickened and disgusted.

'There's meant to be a five minute period of grace, I know that, I was just one minute over that and I'd had really bad news.

'My dad died just days later.

'I think it's a complete disgrace and I can't believe this company is allowed to operate near to a hospital.

'They don't take into account people's personal circumstances, it's completely callous.

'I just want other people to be aware of this company and what they do.'
