While most of the notoriously violent weddings featured in Game of Thrones end in bloodshed, for one couple's fantasy-themed big day, there was a happy outcome instead.

Heather and Robert Balise have long been obsessed with all things magical, among them the HBO drama and Tolkien's Lord of the Rings novels, and their wedding was no exception.

Held in a crumbling medieval-style castle, the nuptials saw guests arrive dressed as fantasy characters and dance the night away to music played by a DJ dressed as Lord of the Rings wizard Gandalf.

Romantic: The couple chose medieval ensembles for their big day at Dunafon Castile, which was built in 1941

Mr Balise, 29, wore a suit of armour in dragon green for the wedding, which took place at Dunafon Castle in Colorado, while Mrs Balise, 37, was romantic in a cream dress with hanging sleeves.

'From the moment we got engaged we knew we wanted our wedding to reflect our personalities and our passions,' said an overjoyed Mrs Balise.

'We
 joked about flying everyone to the UK so we could get married in a 
castle before we learned there was a castle here in Colorado.'

During the event, friends and family dressed as characters from their own favourite fantasy films, among them Harry Potter, Dr Who and Battlestar Galactica, watched as the couple left the castle to the sounds of the Hobbit's theme tune and cut a cake featuring a dragon.

Unlike the weddings seen in Game of Thrones, no one was poisoned or murdered in any other way, and according to Mrs Balise, all enjoyed the day.

'It was all a bit of a happy blur to me but there was a lot of laughter, merriment, feasting and dancing,' she continues.

'We're both huge fans of the fantasy genre and are glued to the television for every episode of Game of Thrones.

'A lot of our friends are also into fantasy so they naturally enjoyed the theme as much as we did.'

Detail: Props included the 'Crown of Aragon' while the cake featured a coiled dragon

Tasty: The wedding also included a spectacular medieval style buffet served on groaning trestle tables

Happy ending: Unlike in Game of Thrones' notoriously violent weddings, no one died and all enjoyed the day
