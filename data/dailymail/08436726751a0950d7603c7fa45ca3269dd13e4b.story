Shocking footage has emerged of a group of drunken teenage girls kicking and stomping on the heads of two female victims while another friend tried in vain to stop the assault.

Police in Dunedin, New Zealand, are searching for six to seven girls - believed to be aged 15 and 16 - who are seen in the video drinking premixed alcoholic drinks out of cans as they assault the victims aged 18 and 19.

Annalise Cooper and Makayla Spiers were at their friend Tae Flavell's house to have a drink on Saturday night when they heard the group of girls walking down the street kicking over wheelie bins about 10.20pm.

The three women challenged the teenagers about the mess they were making.

The girls then proceeded to drag Miss Cooper by her hair onto the road and kick her in the head so many times she suffered a concussion, the Otago Daily Times reported

She was left with a large bruise after one attacker stomped on her forehead.

Miss Flavell was hit in her glasses, grabbed by the hair, punched and pushed to the ground with such force she broke her ankle.

'I was screaming and this girl ran up and punched me in the face ... As I curled up on the ground she kicked me in the ribs,' Miss Flavell said.

Miss Spiers was not attacked but suffered minor injuries as she tried to protect her friends.

'It was just continuous kicking and punching to the body, head ribs, just everywhere. I would pull one girl off and another would start ... I was just useless,' she said.

The assault lasted 10 minutes and is believed to have been filmed by a young male who was accompanying the 15 and 16-year-old girls.

Miss Cooper and Miss Flavell were taken to hospital to be treated.

Police are investigating information that the group of assailants were involved in an earlier incident at a party.
