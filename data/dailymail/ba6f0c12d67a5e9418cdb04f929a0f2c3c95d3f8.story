A high-profile Philadelphia attorney was 'devastated and frantic' when he learned that his 26-year-old girlfriend had been found dead in his home, friends revealed.

A. Charles Peruto Jr. was on the Jersey shore in Avalon, New Jersey, on Saturday when a maintenance man found Julia Papazian Law naked, face-down in the bathtub at Peruto's upscale three-story brick home.

Peruto has described being heartbroken by his young girlfriend's sudden death and released a bizarre tribute to the woman on his Facebook page, calling her his 'soulmate hippy.'

Peruto's friend, Richard L. DeSipio, told the Philadelphia Inquirer that he Peruto called him as he raced back to Philadelphia after learning of Miss Law's death.

'He was just devastated. He was just in hysterics. I was afraid he was going to get into an accident,' DeSipio said.

Miss Law had been working as Peruto's paralegal for about two years, according to reports.

Today, Peruto posted an odd tribute to the Miss Law on his Facebook page, according to NBC Philadelphia.

He wrote: 'It's very hard to find someone who really matches you on all eight cylinders. I found my soulmate hippy, and can never replace her. We worked and played, and never got enough life.

'I'm grateful we made every minute count, without a single dispute about anything ever. I'm especially sad for her 10-year-old brother, who was her life, along with her loving and close sisters, mother and step-father. Earth lost the best one ever. Happy birthday baby.'

Police sources identified the dead 26-year-old as Julia Law, who reportedly was dating 'super lawyer' A Charles Peruto Jr., who owns the home where the body was found

At the time of her death, Miss Law was three days away from her 27th birthday.

One colleague, who wanted to remain 
anonymous, told the Inquirer that Miss Law had recently talked to 
friends about enduring 'emotional turmoil.'

Philadelphia's Fox affiliate
 reports that authorities do not currently consider the death to be 
suspicious, although, the cause of death currently is unknown.

The
 woman's body was discovered at about 10:30am by a maintenance worker 
who stopped by the home, located in Philadelphia's Center City 
neighborhood.

Speaking
 to NBC Philadelphia in Spanish, the worker said: 'The first thing I did
 was call 9-1-1 and police showed up. I then went to homicide to give my
 accounts of what happened.'

The station also reported that no drugs were found in the home.

Peruto told police he had been at the
 Jersey Shore, in Avalon, when the body was found. He was questioned by 
detectives and has not been arrested.

He would not speak to reporters seeking comment outside of his home.

He has handled numerous high-profile cases in the Philadelphia area, including alleged mobsters and killers.

According to his website, Peruto has been dubbed a 'super lawyer' - an honor for Philadelphia's top attorneys - by his peers nine years in a row, and has achieved 'Not Guilty verdict in over 200 jury trials and 2,500 non-jury trials.'

'He has been hired by other attorneys for the sole purpose of cross examining one or two witnesses in their cases,' the website boasts.

It goes on to say that 'as can be seen on this website under "Past Cases,"  he has been called a "ferocious cross examiner," "gives a supreme closing argument to a Jury," and "very entertaining on an otherwise boring case.'"

In 2012, Peruto 'successfully' represented Philadelphia weatherman John Bolaris in a situation the media dubbed ' the real life Hangover.'

Bolaris claimed he was drugged and scammed out of $43,712 by Russian 'bar girls' in Miami. He subsequently lost his job with Philadelphia's Fox affiliate.

Police continue to investigate the circumstances of the death.
