Intelligence: The machine, cutting-edge at the time, used a series of rotor blades to scramble Morse Code messages so they were impossible to read.

A rare German encoding machine used by the Nazis to send secret messages in the dying days of the Second World War will go on sale this month.

The machine, built in 1944, was part of the German intelligence operation famously thwarted by British intelligence officers working out of Bletchley Park.

A specialist from London auctioneers Bonhams said the 'untouched and unrestored' device is especially valuable because it still has many of its original parts, and was not modified after the war.

Engima machines were used through the war by the German military, but this was a later model which sent out even more heavily-encrypted signals than earlier versions, and had billions of possible combinations.

The device would had three sets of rotors, which scrambled messages typed into the keypad, which were then printed and sent out via Morse code. Other Enigma machines with the rotors configured in the same pattern would be able to read the messages.

This version also comes with an original ebonite 'plugboard', which when added to the Engima would swap pairs of letters so that, for example, pressing the F key would send a letter B to be scrambled at the rotors, and would require a matching device at the other end to make sense of the message.

The machine up for auction at Bonhams was built in 1944, by Heimsoeth & Rinke, Serial No. 19088. The
Enigma comes complete with its original I, III and V rotors with 
Bakelite thumbwheels and matching serial numbers, its makers plate 
stamped A 19088/jla/44, and its standard QWERTZ keyboard with keys made 
up of white lettering on black background.

Its
battery switch, vacant battery box, complete set of bulbs, ebonite plug
board, set of three plug board cables, and set of instructions applied 
to the lid interior together with a spare bulb rack are also original.

The
machine rests in an oak carrying case with a hinged lid and a fall 
front with a locking mechanism; when closed, the case measures 6 inches 
by 11inches by 13 inches.

Endless battle: The Germans renewed the encryption on the Enigma machines every day, which the British would have to crack again

Jon 
Baddeley, a specialist at Bonhams, said: 'It’s difficult to tell exactly how many
Enigma machines were made.

'During the war, many were destroyed for fear
of them falling into enemy hands, and documents about their manufacture
were often burned or simply lost. What we do know is that there were at
least five mainstream versions employed by the German military.

'The
first machines to be used in a military capacity only had a fixed set 
of three wheels. Later, a set of five wheels were used so that they 
could be interchanged to dramatically increase the number of variants 
available.

'Each machine could use the interchangeable wheels from any 
enigma, so to find a matching set of wheels with the same serial number 
as the Enigma is rare.'

Invention: Turing's Bombe machine thwarted the Engima code. They were all destroyed after the war, but one was rebuilt in 2008, and is seen here with veterans Ruth Bourne, left, and Jean Valentine, right, who served at Bletchley Park.

'Enigma machines rarely come up at auction, and this 
particular example is especially unique.

'It’s
unusual because it has Bakelite thumb wheels instead of the more widely
used metal ones: this was due to the diminishing availability of metal 
and other resources for the Wehrmacht [German military] towards the end of the war.

'It’s
also special because it’s untouched and un-restored. Many machines were
picked up by the allies as souvenirs during the final stages of World 
War II, and as such, their parts were mixed and matched.

'All of the 
elements of this one bear the same serial number, making it complete and
original throughout'.

However, despite the sophisticated features of the encoding machines, German efforts at keeping their communications secret were continually defeated by teams working at the top-secret Bletchley Park intelligence centre in Buckinghamshire.

They were able to crack the Engima code in part thanks to the efforts of mathematical genius Alan Turing, who developed a mechanical device called the Bombe, a forerunner of modern computers, which was able to greatly speed up the process of cracking German codes, which changed every day.

The intelligence gleaned from sources including Engima transmissions was known as 'Ultra', and was decisive in the Allied victory.

After winning the war, Winston Churchill reportedly told King George VI: 'It was thanks to Ultra that we won the war.'

Sir Harry Hinsley, the official historian of British Intelligence in World War II, also held Ultra in high esteem and said that thanks to the information the war was shortened: 'by not less than two years and probably by four years.'

The intelligence war waging in a quiet corner of Buckinghamshire was to be decisive in the Allied effort to win the Second World War.

Station X - known now as Bletchley Park - was the hub of Britain's code-backing effort, where hugely talented mathematicians and inventors worked tirelessly to give the armed forces a crucial helping-hand.

As Winston Churchill himself made clear, the accurate information which flowed from Bletchley Park every day, at a rate which sometimes reached 6,000 messages a day, saved lives and gave Britain a crucial edge in battle.

Alan Turing, the Cambridge-educated mathematical genius, and Post Office Engineer Tommy Flowers, are the two most celebrated figures whose innovations greatly improved the Allied ability to decipher German messages.

The Enigma machine, which was on sale commercially in the 1920s, was modified by the Germans to make it more secure. They trusted completely that its codes were unbreakable, and used it for all manner of important communications.

Technology: The Colossus computer, shown here being rebuilt by Tony Sale, cracked the German Lorenz Cipher, unlocking even more secret intelligence.

However, it was thwarted in part thanks to Alan Turing's 'Bombe' device, which was able to speed up the code-breaking process immeasurably.

Turing based his invention on a Polish device, the 'Bomba', which was handed over to Britain just weeks before Poland was invaded in 1939.

It was not able to decipher German codes automatically, but once analysts had manually deciphered a few letters by picking out common words, such as the names of German generals or short words such as 'to' and 'they', the device could rapidly test hundreds of other possibilities to put together a code.

Over 100 of the machines were built to aid the code-breaking effort, but they were all destroyed when the war ended. A replica was built in 2008, and can be seen at Bletchley Park, which is now a museum.

The quest to beat the German intelligence services also resulted in the construction of the world's first proper computer - called Colossus.

Developed by Tommy Flowers from a network of thousands of electronic valves, the device was able to crack the Lorenz Cipher, which the Nazi high command used for messages deemed too sensitive for Engima transmission.

The Colossus Mark II, which was five times faster than the original, was finished less than a week before the Normandy landings, and gave the Allies another crucial edge in the last phase of the war.
