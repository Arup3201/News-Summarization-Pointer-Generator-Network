PC Saheena Tegally, 35, is accused of swapping numbers and sending a Porsche 911 driver flirty texts after pulling him over on the road

A policewoman is accused of telling colleagues to let an uninsured Porsche driver off the hook after sending him a flirtatious message reading: ‘It’s really hot – I’m in my bikini.’

Saheena Tegally, 26, was on patrol with two other officers when she stopped Richard Myerson in his 911 turbo and asked for his insurance papers, a court heard yesterday.

She then allegedly swapped numbers with him and later began sending  ‘inappropriate’ texts and emails.

Tegally is then said to have told a colleague to ‘rip up’ his notes on the incident after the driver asked her out on a date. The officer was seen ‘laughing and flirting’ with Mr Myerson before giving him her mobile number and asking him to return to the police station at 11am the next day to present his insurance documents, London’s Wood Green Crown Court heard.

The following day, she allegedly told colleagues that he was in fact insured.

She is said to have shown them  part of an email chain to support  this – but left out the bit explaining  that his insurance had expired two months earlier.

David Markham, prosecuting, said Tegally ‘seemed to be flirting’ during her first encounter with the driver in Highgate, North London, in July last year. ‘PC Tegally offered her personal mobile phone number to Mr Myerson,’ he added. Soon, the pair began messaging each other, the court heard.

Tegally was asked in an email by Mr Myerson: ‘Is it hot in London?’ She responded: ‘It’s really hot. I’m in my bikini catching the sun.’ PC Glenn Smith, who was with her when they first pulled over the driver, told the court: ‘She was laughing and joking, over- friendly for someone we had just met and were investigating.’

Another colleague, PC Mike Cole,  said he noticed she was receiving  ‘quite a few’ texts while on duty the next day. He added: ‘I asked who they were from. She replied “Richard the Porsche man. He asked me out on a date.” I asked if she was going and  she replied “no”.’

Tegally later showed her colleagues documents that appeared to indicate Myerson was insured, the court heard.

'Just rip it up': Tegally allegedly tried to get the driver off the hook for being uninsured

PC Saheena Tegally appeared at Wood Green Crown Court accused of perverting the course of justice in relation to insurance documents of a Porsche driver

When
 PC Smith wanted details of  his insurance to file a report, Tegally 
allegedly told him: ‘Why are you doing the book? He’s insured, just rip 
it up.’

PC Smith said he 
reported the conversation to his managers, adding: ‘I had my suspicions.
 The text messages, the behaviour on the evening that the Porsche was 
stopped. I didn’t want to believe he wasn’t insured.’

Myerson
 was later convicted of driving without insurance. Tegally, who wore a 
black blazer and a blue blouse in the dock, denies perverting the course
 of justice. The officer, of London Colney in Hertfordshire, has been 
suspended.

The trial continues.
