A romantic Swiss student who had his smartphone stolen has promised the young woman who ended up with the device that she can keep it, if she agrees to meet up with him.

Niklaus Knecht, 24, realised his phone had ended up in the hands of a pretty girl living in Morocco after she started using it as a camera, unaware that the phone's picture upload function was still switched on.

The smartphone was stolen in April of this year when he was on a train heading to Zurich in Switzerland and had dozed off, waking up to find that someone had sliced open his jacket pocket.

The unknown girl pictured relaxing in a park, Mr Knecht wants to meet up with her, and says she can keep the phone

He bought a new one and forgot about his old handset, expecting to never see it again until suddenly pictures of the young girl and snaps taken by her started turning up in his dropbox.

Some of the pictures are relatively mundane, such as snaps from her student study plan, but others show what could be family members in traditional Moroccan dress.

But the photographs that caught Mr Knecht's attention show the girl herself, sometimes lying on a bed, other times showing off new clothes such as a new dress or posing by romantic backdrops such as a waterfall or in a park.

The girl is shown relaxing around her home, and cuddling up to a teddy bear with the words 'I love you' on it

In another picture she has a cuddly teddy with the words 'I love you', and others are simply snaps from everyday life smoking a cigarette on the beach or cooking some of her favourite dishes.

He said: 'She obviously doesn't realise that all the pictures she is taking are ending up in my dropbox and it's a pretty good general view of an everyday life in Morocco.'

He added: 'I am really keen to find out who she is and more about her. I'd like to meet her and am prepared to travel to Morocco to see her.

'I think it would be interesting to find out how she ended up getting the phone, although I'm sure she had nothing to do with the original theft.

Close encounter: The girl has taken many photographs, including close-ups such as this one. But will she get close to the phone's original owner?

'I guess she simply bought it from whoever did steal it.'

Mr Knecht and his friend Alex Moshovelis have now set up a Facebook site in the hope that the girl will get in touch and they have uploaded some of her snaps.

He said: 'I can see that some 13,000 people in Morocco have looked at the Facebook page so I'm fairly confident that somebody will be able to identify her or one of the people from the hundreds of snaps she's uploaded on the phone.Â 

'It would be great to meet her and of course she's welcome to keep the phone.

'I
 am just keen to find out a little bit more about how she got the phone 
and I think it would be an interesting project as part of my 
schoolwork.'
