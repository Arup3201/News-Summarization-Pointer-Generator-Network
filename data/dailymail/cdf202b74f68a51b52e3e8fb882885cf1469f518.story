Larry Sanders is currently out of the NBA after a tumultuous tenure with the Milwaukee Bucks, but the former first-round pick is happy with the new path he has chosen. In an exclusive interview with ThePlayersTribune.com, Sanders revealed that he needed to take a step back from the NBA in order to explore other avenues. 'I love basketball, and if I get to a point where I feel I'm capable of playing basketball again, I will,' Sanders wrote. 'I've had to make the difficult decision to follow my intuition, and allow myself the space and time to explore my true purpose in life.' After five seasons with the Bucks, the 6'11' centre was recently waived. Sanders played in only 27 games during the 2014-15 season, as he missed some time while dealing with personal issues and then checked himself into a hospital to treat anxiety issues during his hiatus.

Good Week 

It started with goosebumps and ended with a triumphant result. Nearly eight years after Minnesota traded Kevin Garnett to the Boston Celtics, the team reintroduced him to the Land of 10,000 Lakes to a deafening roar from the Target Center crowd. Garnett set the tone early with an emphatic rejection and that laid the foundation for a 97-77 Minnesota Timberwolves victory over the Washington Wizards. Garnett finished with five points, eight rebounds, two assists, two blocks and a steal, but his contributions spanned well beyond the box score. Although he's lost a few steps at 38 years old, Garnett still ranks near the top of the NBA when it comes to defending post-ups.

Bad Week

Miami Heat star Chris Bosh will miss the rest of the 2014-15 season after blood clots were discovered on his lung. Bosh has been receiving care under the guidance of Miami Heat team physicians at a local hospital and his prognosis is good. Bosh has been one of the most consistent stars in the NBA over the past decade. He's earned 10 straight All-Star Game appearances and won two championships. Dwyane Wade says he believes Bosh will be back eventually, tweeting: 'This is not a career-ending thing.'

By blending two great athletes, Nike has come up with a new trainer design. Cleveland Cavaliers superstar LeBron James and golf legend Arnold Palmer may not seem like a logical pairing, but Nike has found a way to make it work with the new 'LeBronold Palmer' shoes. The colour scheme will certainly catch your eye. However, also check out the logo on the back, which represents the popular Arnold Palmer drink - half lemonade, half ice tea.
