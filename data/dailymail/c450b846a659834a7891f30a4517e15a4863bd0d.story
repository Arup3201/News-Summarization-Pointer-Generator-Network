Relisha Rudd who has been reported missing

The mother of a missing eight-year-old girl is pleading for the safe return of her daughter who is believed to have been kidnapped by a janitor who worked at the homeless shelter where the family were staying. 

Khalil Tatum, 51, has already been charged with murdering his wife Andrea Tatum after her body was found in Red Roof Inn, in Oxon Hill, Washington, last Thursday - a day after Relisha Rudd was reported missing. 

Police have not yet revealed how Mrs Tatum died but it has been reported that her body showed signs of trauma.

Relisha's family allowed the child to be looked after by Tatum who the family got to know over an 18-month period when they were staying at the shelter. 

According to police, Relisha's mother asked Tatum to look after her daughter on February 26.

Miss Young, 27, was living at the homeless shelter at the former D.C. General Hospital with four of her children and their stepfather. 

Relisha is about 4ft tall and weighs between 70 and 80 pounds.

According to police, officers obtained a search warrant on Thursday and went to the Red Roof Inn where they found Mrs Tatum's body in a room.

Tatum's white truck was in the Inn's parking lot.

Police said Miss Young initially didn't report Relisha missing and told officers she had spoken to her by phone on Wednesday. 

However, it has since been revealed that Miss Young met with Tatum and asked him to return Relisha which he has not done.

Jamila Larson, executive director of the Homeless Childrenâ€™s Playtime Project which runs programs at five D.C. shelters, including the one at D.C. General, told the Washington Post: 'Relisha is a sweet, quiet girl.'

On Saturday a candlelit vigil was held in South East Washington where dozens gathered to pray for Relisha's safe return.

I miss my daughter,' Miss Young, told The Washington Post at the vigil. 'I cry every night for her.'

Her stepfather, Antonio Wheeler, added: 'I just want my baby back.'
