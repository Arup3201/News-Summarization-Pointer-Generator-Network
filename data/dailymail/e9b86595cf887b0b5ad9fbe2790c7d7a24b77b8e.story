Earlier this week Taylor Swift removed her entire back catalog from music streaming service Spotify, and now the singer has explained why.

The decision came at the same time she was promoting new album 1989, which sold 1.287 copies in its first week, just shy of Britney Spears' record for the biggest-ever album weekly sales by a female artist (1.319million).

'If I had streamed the new album, it’s impossible to try to speculate what would have happened,' Taylor told Yahoo of leaving Spotify.

Explanation: Taylor Swift, pictured on Tuesday in Tokyo, has revealed that she removed all of her music from Spotify because she doesn't want to contribute her 'life's work to an experiment'

'But all I can say is that music is changing so quickly, and the landscape of the music industry itself is changing so quickly, that everything new, like Spotify, all feels to me a bit like a grand experiment. And I’m not willing to contribute my life’s work to an experiment that I don’t feel fairly compensates the writers, producers, artists, and creators of this music.' 

The 24-year-old added: 'And I just don’t agree with perpetuating the perception that music has no value and should be free.'

Taylor referenced the piece she wrote for the Wall Street Journal in July in which she expressed that she does not believe music should be free, and in her interview with Yahoo went on: 'I try to stay really open-minded about things, because I do think it’s important to be a part of progress.

'But I think it’s really still up for debate whether this is actual progress, or whether this is taking the word “music” out of the music industry.'

Taylor's current single Shake It Off was among the songs she removed, and had been the most streamed track on the service in the U.S., the U.K. and globally.

And she explained she was keen on giving the service a try, but that it just didn't work out. Taylor told Yahoo: 'A lot of people were suggesting to me that I try putting new music on Spotify with Shake It Off, and so I was open-minded about it.

'I thought, "I will try this; I’ll see how it feels." It didn’t feel right to me. I felt like I was saying to my fans, "If you create music someday, if you create a painting someday, someone can just walk into a museum, take it off the wall, rip off a corner off it, and it’s theirs now and they don’t have to pay for it." 

Taylor added: 'I didn’t like the perception that it was putting forth. And so I decided to change the way I was doing things.'

In a statement posted on Spotify’s website after her music was removed, the company said it was trying to get the hit-maker to change her mind.

‘We love Taylor Swift, and our more than 40 million users love her even more – nearly 16 million of them have played her songs in the last 30 days, and she’s on over 19 million playlists.

‘We hope she’ll change her mind and join us in building a new music economy that works for everyone. 

'We believe fans should be able to listen to music wherever and whenever they want, and that artists have an absolute right to be paid for their work and protected from piracy. That’s why we pay nearly 70 percent of our revenue back to the music community.'   

Smash hit success: The decision came at the same time she was promoting new album 1989, which sold 1.287 copies in its first week, just shy of Britney Spears' record for the biggest-ever album weekly sales by a female artist (1.319million) 

It has been suggested the decision may have been instigated by Taylor's record label, reports Billboard. Big Machine Label Group is up for sale and a source said the decision to leave Spotify was aimed at driving up the sales price. 

'Big Machine is in the process of selling itself, and that can't be forgotten here. [They're looking to] increase the multiple for the sale of that company. [Owner] Scott Borchetta is a very old-school thinker. He's wrong,' said the source.

It isn't unusual for major artists to wait a while before releasing new material to the streaming service - Coldplay, The Black Keys and Beyoncé have all withheld their latest albums in a bid to encourage greater first week physical sales.

Taylor's last album, Red, didn't make it onto Spotify until eight months after it was first launched.

More unusual is the singer's decision to remove her back catalog from the service, while her older albums currently remain available on rival Beats Music, which is owned by Apple.

In the past Spotify has drawn criticism from some artists who claim it doesn't pay them enough in royalties. 

Radiohead frontman Thom Yorke withdrew his project Atoms for Peace from Spotify in 2013 and launched an angry Twitter tirade over its royalty rates.

'Make no mistake new artists you discover on #Spotify will no get paid,' he posted. 'Meanwhile shareholders will shortly being rolling in it. Simples.'

According to the latest Spotify figures, the service has 10 million paying customers and 30 million free users.

The Seven-time GRAMMY winner recently announced The 1989 World Tour on Good Morning America, which will kick off on 20 May, 2015 in Louisiana, USA.

The 1989 World Tour will encompass eight countries and span four continents including North America, Europe, Australia and Asia. 

Please come back: Spotify announced on Monday that Swift had pulled her entire back catalog from the service and posted a playlist of songs as a plea to the singer to return
