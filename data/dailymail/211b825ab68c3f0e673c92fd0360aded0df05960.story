The front row was dotted with celebrities dressed in their best, while behind them, some of fashion's top bloggers applauded enthusiastically as the models made their way down the runway.

But this wasn't a show put on by Chanel or Burberry. Instead, the glamorous ensembles parading down the catwalk were by high street favourite, M&S.

Focusing on pieces from the British brand's A/W14 range, coats dominated with a chic camel wool coat raising approving eyebrows and a practical navy number looking likely to be a top-seller.

Other highlights included fitted shift dresses from the Autograph range as well as a modish cream blanket that looked good enough to give Burberry's enormously popular version a run for its money.

But will it be enough to give M&S' flagging womenswear sales a boost? Style director Belinda Earl is positive that it will.

'We've had a great 
reaction to our coats this season,' said a jubilant Earl following the show. 'From classic styles through to fun 
faux furs, colour and texture have been key.

'With the unseasonably warm
 weather, dresses and separates are also proving very popular.

'The 
catwalk show has given us a great opportunity to show, not only 
our key outfits for the season, but also our fabulous footwear and 
accessories.'

Despite the success of last autumn's 
pink duster coat, which will be reissued this year in a rainbow of hues,
 M&S has struggled to compete with cheap and cheerful brands such as
 Primark and New Look.

Damp squib collections for Per Una haven't
 helped and have allowed Next, which specialises in stylish, 
middle-of-the-road pieces, to pull ahead.

Even the much vaunted 
'Leading Ladies' campaign starring Helen Mirren, Tracey Emin and Grace 
Coddington failed to make much of an impact.

But the colourful new collection and catwalk show, which saw Oliver Cheshire, Rosie Fortescue and Lilah Parsons take seats on the front row during Vodafone London Fashion Weekend, could yet transform its fortunes.

Along with coats and key pieces from the Autograph and Per Una ranges, the show also featured tailoring and dresses from the well received Best of British collection.

Drawing on heritage pieces from the M&S archive, the range includes a flattering cotton blouse in a chic red and white print, and a pure wool pale grey duffle coat.

Traditional fabrics such as herringbone 
and jacquard made by British artisans also featured, with the latter turned into wearable cocktail 
dresses that would do sterling service on chilly autumn nights.

'Since 
2013 Marks & Spencer has been the lead partner of the British 
Fashion Councilâ€™s Positive Fashion initiative, a bid to support and 
encourage positive change within the fashion industry,' commented a 
spokesman for the brand.

'The Best of British Collection is a commitment to this initiative, championing Great British style, design and manufacturing.'

One potential shopper who is already won over by the UK made collection is Earl herself. 'A personal highlight was the of the Best of British Winter collection,' she added.

'It launches in stores and online in October and the show-stopping dresses and outfits for the party season.'
