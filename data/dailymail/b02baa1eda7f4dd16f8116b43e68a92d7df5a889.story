Like any youngster, this tiny pup can think of no better way to spend a sunny day than playing in the golden sands at the beach.

But there's no slathering on the factor 50 and mother has certainly got her flippers full - with 80 young sea lions to take care of.

As these stunning pictures taken on the wildlife paradise of Galapagos show, sea lions have their own natural way of avoiding getting too much sun - covering themselves in sand.

Fresh out of the water, the tiny creature rolls around on the shore covering himself from the glaring burn of the sun.

And if he's missed a spot with the sand, mother is on hand to shield her son and stop him getting burnt.

Galapagos has its own unique species of sea lion which was discovered by E Sivertsen in 1953.

They are known to grow up to two and a half metres long and are classed as a vulnerable species by wildlife experts.

Group mentality: This sea lion was one of 80 enjoying a day at the beach on the Galapagos islands

They can grow to weigh more than 60 stone at their heaviest with the male of the species tending to grow larger than females.

Males are coloured brown, females tend to be a lighter tan and juveniles are coloured chestnut brown.

The mammals spend much of their time 
swimming in the ocean but when on land prefer flat areas with plenty of 
shade or laying on the beach like the group pictured.

No fear: A sea lion seems completely unfazed as a tourist kisses it on the nose while swimming in the sea

Pups normally weigh just under a 
stone when they're born and are tended to continuously by their mother 
for the first week of their life.

They head into the water and begin swimming after one or two weeks.

The marine mammals mainly feed upon fish, squid, crustaceans and octopus.
