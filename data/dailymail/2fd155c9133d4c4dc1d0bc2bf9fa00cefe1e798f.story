The attorney for a Michigan woman whose newborn baby boy was found dead in a suburban Detroit recycling center said she 'did as well as she could' in caring for the child.

Angela Alexie, 24, of Eastpointe, allegedly delivered the baby on her own in the unattached garage of a friend's house where she was living.  

Steven Kaplan, Alexie's attorney, said she has a 'severe lack of parenting skills, limited intelligence and lack of family support' in court yesterday.

Workers found the child naked and bundled in a black shirt as his body came down the conveyor at the Recommunity Recycling center in Roseville on January 14

Workers found the child naked and bundled in a black shirt as his body came down the conveyor at the Recommunity Recycling center in Roseville on January 14, according to the Detroit Free Press.  

It is believed that the child was born on or around December 22 and died Christmas Eve night, but the Macomb County Medical Examiner's Office is still working to confirm the timeline. 

The boy, unofficially named Henry Alexander Macomb by morgue workers, 'must have suffered greatly' while left in the garage with low temperatures in the 30s, Roseville Police Chief James Berlin said.

Police said Alexie went to and from the garage while living in the house to check on the baby and to feed him. 

They believe that the boy's body was put in a recycling bin that was picked up from the home on January 13.

Alexie claims someone else - though she does not know who - put the baby in the recycling bin, according to the police. They believe she acted alone, but she did not give reasons for her actions.

Alexie, who has three other young children in foster care, is charged with felony murder and child abuse in the death of her son. 

Kaplan will not seek a competency exam because it appeared to him that 'she has sufficient cognizance to assist her attorney in the hearing'.

He plans to request a forensic evaluation regarding the issue of criminal responsibility or culpability, which he believes could lead to an insanity defense. 

Kaplan added that the defense will state on the record today that all of Alexie's rights regarding the burial of the baby will be released. 

The Macomb community has rallied together to provide a funeral and burial for the baby.

Eastpointe Judge Carl Gerds set bond at $1million.
