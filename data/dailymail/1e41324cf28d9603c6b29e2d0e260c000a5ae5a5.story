 A foreign businessman who bombarded Britons with 500,000 spam text messages a day has been convicted after being exposed by a Mail on Sunday undercover investigation.

But Jayesh Shah, 43, has escaped with just a £4,000 fine – and investigators say he may still be plaguing mobile phone users with unsolicited texts and nuisance calls.

Shah, who runs a call centre business based in India, was revealed to be behind thousands of spam messages inviting people to claim compensation for mis-sold payment protection insurance (PPI) in December 2012.

He was prosecuted for breaching the Data Protection Act at a trial in May. Judgment was reserved to a hearing last week at Willesden Magistrates’ Court in North-West London, when Shah was found guilty and fined. He did not attend the hearing.

Shah had tried to argue at the trial in May that British law did not apply to him because he operated out of India. But a district judge ruled that Shah did have to obey UK laws because he came here touting for business.

However, the Information Commissioner’s Office (ICO) admits it does not know whether Shah is still sending spam texts and nuisance calls – although the ruling means they can continue to investigate him.

The ICO’s David Clancy said: ‘Shah cannot just sit in India and say, “I am going to generate all these calls to the UK and nothing is going to happen.”

‘Shah made it quite clear he came to the UK to speak to clients. As far as we are aware, he’s still operating.

‘It’s difficult to say whether he’s still doing it because he does not identify who he is when he’s making calls or who the [text message] sender is.

‘The options for us are to review whatever evidence we have in relation to his business operations based in the UK.’

Shah is chief executive of his IT company Vinayak Infotech & Telecommunications Solutions (Vintels), based in the Indian city of Pune, 90 miles east of Mumbai.

Vintels closed down its website last week but Shah is still registered with UK authorities as someone who handles the personal data of Britons.

It was on one of his trips to the UK in December 2012 that Shah boasted to an undercover Mail on Sunday reporter how his firm had sent huge numbers of messages telling people they were entitled to free refunds on the PPI policies they had taken out.

Anyone who responded to the texts was seen as a ‘lead’, and their mobile number was sold to a claims management company for up to £7.50.

Shah told our reporter he had made millions of pounds out of his business, and claimed he was immune from prosecution as it operated from outside the UK.

But he tangled himself up with red tape. Anyone selling debt leads in the UK has to have a consumer credit licence and Shah obeyed that rule. He also registered as a ‘data controller’ with the ICO.

But he failed to declare the true nature of his business on the register – that of ‘lead generating’ or selling and using people’s phone numbers for marketing – and it was on that breach he was found guilty.

The judge decided he could not argue that UK laws did not apply to him because his operation was abroad as he had a UK consumer credit licence.

District Judge Mark Jabbitt said: ‘I’m dealing with a failure to keep his entry up to date. I’m not dealing with his company’s sending millions of unsolicited text messages to people in this country.’

Shah provided no explanation why he was not present or represented, and in his absence was fined £4,000 for the breach, ordered to pay £2,703 costs and a £400 victim surcharge within 28 days or a warrant can be issued for his arrest.

The British authorities have found it almost impossible to get to the bottom of Shah’s operations because he does not have a base here – he used to sleep on his sister’s sofa in North-West London when he came to the UK touting for business.

After the case, one of Shah’s victims, wholesale firm boss Ian Lithgow, 51, from Whitstable in Kent, said: ‘It’s a victory but it does not stop it. I think Shah has got off lightly. He should have got a bigger fine.’
