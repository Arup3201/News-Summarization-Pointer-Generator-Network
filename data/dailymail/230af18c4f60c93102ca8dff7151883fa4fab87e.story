Accused murderer Gable Tostee has declared his innocence from behind bars, posting a message on Facebook from custody, where he is being held over the balcony death of New Zealander Warriena Wright.

Tostee, who has been in police custody for the past month, thanked his friends and family on social media for their support.

The 28 year old is accused of murdering 26 year old tourist Ms Wright, who plummeted 14 floors from his apartment on the Gold Coast, Queensland. They reportedly met on dating app Tinder.

Gable Tostee was last month charged with the murder of Warriena Wright after she fell from the balcony of his apartment in Gold Coast, Queensland, on August 8. Tostee has denied the charge

Gable Tostee posted this message today on Facebook, despite remaining in police custody

Tostee said today in the Facebook post: 'To my friends and those who have been supporting me, I want to thank you and say that I miss you all.'

'I have been in custody for almost a month now for a crime I did not commit and have lost contact with almost everyone.'

'I maintain my absolute innocence and hope that this nightmare will be over soon.'

An alleged account of Ms Wright's final hours by police claims Tostee held Ms Wright in a 78-second long stranglehold and may have made her drink 'vodka' brewed from a homemade still inside his Surfers Paradise apartment before her death.

A transcript of an audio recording found on Tostee's phone has been submitted by Queensland Police in documents to Brisbane Supreme Court in opposition to a bail application by Tostee.

The recording spans an eight hour period of time from when Tostee met Ms Wright up until the early hours of the morning as he was sat with his father in a parked car awaiting legal assistance

The documents claim Ms Wright used her online name Cletus to set up a date with Tostee on the mobile dating app in Surfers Paradise on August 7.

It is alleged the pair were captured on CCTV at 8.45pm meeting outside a surf shop before going to a shop to buy beer. They then allegedly go to Tostee's apartment where they socialise and drink. 

Gable Tostee was an active Tinder dater in the months leading up to his meeting Warriena Wright on August 7

It is alleged the pair were captured on CCTV at 8.45pm meeting outside a surf shop before going to a shop to buy beer. They then allegedly go to Tostee's apartment where they socialise and drink 

Documents submitted to the court claim the recording found on Tostee's phone started just before 1am, and 20 seconds into the recording a male voice says 'F*** me', the Brisbane Times has reported.

Sounds of groaning can be heard, then the male tells the woman she is being too rough during sex, and says 'I don't like being beaten up'.  

According to documents submitted by police to the court, the sounds of a struggle begin at about 2.10am after the sound of drinks being poured had been heard a few minutes earlier.

Over the next few minutes the argument gets worse and at 2.13am the sounds of a struggle are interspersed with his swearing and her saying 'OK, it is all good' while she sounds out of breath.

During the 10 minutes leading up to 2.21am he calls her a 'god damn psycho' twice and there are further sounds of the struggle. 

The transcript of the three hour and 19-minute recording, which covers an eight hour period, allegedly documents Ms Wright's tryst with Tostee, heavy drinking, a violent argument and her fatal fall

'There are sounds of slapping and [Tostee] saying "let go, let go". The sounds of restricted breathing coninue for 78 seconds and only stops when there is the sounds of something dropping and then [Tostee] complains about her trying to hit him.

'At this stage the deceased's airway is no longer restricted and she starts yelling out "no" repeatedly.

'This escalates in crescendo and anxiety and there are sounds of the balcony door being opened, and scuffling consistent with [Tostee] dragging the deceased towards the balcony.'

The Crown continues: 'This part of the struggle' takes just under one minute, commencing 'at 2.19.48am and continues until 2.20.46am, at which point the door can be heard slamming shut leaving the deceased on the balcony and [Tostee] inside the unit.

'The last thing said before the deceased is outside the balcony is her screams intensifying as she screams "just let me go home".

'[Tostee] says in a very aggressive tone, "I would but you have been a bad girl".

'Her voice becomes more muffled and it is apparent she is on the other side of the door.

'At 2.21.12am, one hour, 24 minutes and 25 seconds into the recording, a scream can be heard that fades, consistent with the deceased falling.' 

A judge on Monday described the charge of murder against Tostee as 'difficult' because the 28-year-old was not on the balcony at the time Ms Wright fell to her death.

Police have claimed Tostee taunted Ms Wright in his flat when she threatened to call the police after discovering her iPhone was missing

Police have opposed the bail application for Tostee, saying he contacted more than 250 girls on Tinder in the months before he allegedly murdered Ms Wright

It is alleged the pair were captured on CCTV at 8.45pm meeting outside a surf shop before going to a shop to buy beer. They then allegedly go to Tostee's apartment where they socialise and drink

Tostee had an application for bail with the Supreme Court denied by police, who were concerned he had contacted more than 250 girls on Tinder in the months before he allegedly murdered Ms Wright. 

A document filed in the bail application says: 'Police hold a strong belief that if Tostee is granted bail, he will recommence his using social media.'

'Police believe Tostee's blatant disregard for human life and his propensity of violence displayed in this instance would place the safety of the community at an unacceptable risk.'
