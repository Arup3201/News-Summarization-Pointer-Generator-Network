Writer Sally Wainwright yesterday claimed TV viewers are too sensitive to violence against women but never offended by assaults on men.

Referring to an episode of her hit drama Happy Valley in which a policewoman was brutally attacked in a cellar, Miss Wainwright said she wanted to make the scene even more graphic but was stopped by the BBC.

The show attracted criticism from viewers for showing 'gratuitous' violence against women.

Sally Wainwright,  the screenwriter for Happy Valley, defended the latest episode where a policewoman  (Sarah Lancashire) was brutally attacked in a cellar

Episode four of the first series attracted 15 complaints after it showed police sergeant Catherine Cawood, played by Sarah Lancashire, savagely beaten.

As the show ended, she collapsed in the road, her face covered in blood, leaving viewers guessing whether or not she had died. 

Defending the scenes, the 51-year-old writer, who revealed the BBC also restricts swear words in her scripts, said: 'I actually wanted it to be a lot more violent, but the controller of BBC1 [Charlotte Moore] wanted me to pull the violence in.

'And thank God she did … I thought the fuss that was made was ridiculous … violence is horrible, we shouldn't pretend it isn't. It was part of the story – it explains who this man [the attacker] is. He's a psychopath … and it should be awful when we see a woman treated like that. But I don't think it was gratuitous.'

She added: 'I find it odd that we often see violence against men and that isn't made an issue of at all.'

An average of 7.2 million viewers tuned in to Happy Valley last year and the bleak drama set in West Yorkshire is to return for a second series.
