The editor of The New Yorker magazine has predicted that Hillary Clinton will be running for President in 2016, making him one of the boldest names to do so.

With sky-high approval numbers and an empty schedule as soon as she steps down from her position as Secretary of State, the guessing game about Clinton's next move is anything but new.

New Yorker editor David Remnick wrote a piece for the magazine's website explaining that he became certain of her future run after attending a conference about the constantly-evolving political landscape of Israel.

Pushing for president: Hillary Clinton appeared at a political conference about Israel where they featured an elaborate- and extremely positive- introductory video of her

Though many have circulated the theory that Clinton will make her second run for the presidency in 2016, Remnick is one of the most-respected pundits to officially stake the claim.

He explains that the tipping point was when organizers of the Saban Forum used an extremely positive video to introduce the Secretary before she spoke at the conference last week.

'The film was like an international endorsement four years in advance of the Iowa caucus and the New Hampshire primary,' Remnick wrote.

The six-minute film featured an all-star line up of current and former politicians from both sides of the aisle and Atlantic.

Internationally, former prime minister Tony Blair sang her praises as did the foreign defense minister of Jordan Nasser Judeh.

Given that the conference was focused on Israel, it comes as little surprise that sitting president Shimon Peres and prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu spoke, as did defense minister Ehud Barak and former opposition party leader Tzipi Livni.

Positive message: The six-minute video featured praise from a host of international and domestic leaders

Domestically, she was touted by Republican Senator John McCain and former secretary of state Madeline Albright, who served under Bill Clinton during his presidency.

As if to drive the point home for any viewers who missed the point of all of this praise, the video concluded with two very clear allusions to a Clinton run.

'As someone who knows a thing or two about political comebacks, I can tell you I don't think we've heard the last of Hillary Clinton,' Netanyahu said, smiling at the camera.

'I just have an instinct that the best is yet to come,' Tony Blair says as a concluding remark for the video.

Deflection: Clinton joked that she could watch the video again to simply 'count the hairstyles'

As the screen darkened, a conference organizer told the clapping audience to hold on as there was another video tribute to come.

President Barack Obama then appeared on screen to praise his 'partner' and 'friend' for all of her hard work. And he continued to do so for two long minutes.

Clinton graciously laughed the video off, saying that she needed to sit down before beginning her talk because she was so overwhelmed.

'I prepared some remarks for tonight, but then I thought maybe we could just watch that video a few more times. And then the next time, I could count the hairstyles, which is one of my favorite pastimes,' she said, recycling a joke she has used before a number of times.

Send off: The video was followed by a second one made of President Obama praising his 'friend' Hillary

The rest of the conference continued as scheduled, the video showed that many in the international community will volunteer to stump for- if not quite make the Clinton 2016 buttons- Hillary if she chooses to run again.

Pundits on MSNBC said that the video could cause problems for the presumptive candidate, however, as she may feel that she is entitled to the nomination and cast her net too late in the game.

Looking back on the 2008 race, a similar fault occurred when the household Clinton name was trumped by a newcomer named Barack Obama.

In a New York Times article today, it was also revealed that Mayor Michael Bloomberg secretly pitched the idea that Clinton turn her attention from the grand scale to the hyper-local: he suggested that she run for his job after he leaves office next year.

The mayor, not minding that she resides in none of the five boroughs, 'told her it was a great job and one the one-time presidential contender should seriously consider,' according to the NY Post. He is not fond of anyone currently running, they add.

For now, none of those options seem entirely appealing to Mrs Clinton right now.

'I have ruled (a presidential race in 2016) out,' she told The Wall Street Journal recently.

'It's important for me to step off this incredibly high wire I've been on, to take stock of the rest of my life.'
