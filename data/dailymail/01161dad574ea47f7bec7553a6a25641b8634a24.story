Jordan Henderson and Amir Khan met up for an interview this week - in which the Liverpool vice-captain told the champion boxer that he wants his own rumble with Diego Costa.

Henderson clashed with the Chelsea striker  during a Capital One Cup semi-final last month as the two players stared each other down at Anfield.

And the 24-year-old told Khan in an interview which ranged from dietary habits to favourite stadiums, that Costa was the man who he would most like to beat in a 50/50 tackle.

When asked the question by Bolton-born fighter Khan in the MaxiNutrition feature, Henderson laughed and replied:  'At the minute Diego Costa, we had a little tiff the other day so it would probably be him.'

The England international also revealed that Reds captain Steven Gerrard was his idol as he came through the youth ranks at Sunderland before his £16m switch to Anfield back in 2011.

‘It’s hard to say who my sporting hero is because I play with him every week, but obviously Gerrard was one of my idols.’ added Henderson. ‘[Playing with him] was a bit strange at first, and going to meet him in training for the first time, but he’s just a normal guy.’

During the interview, Henderson was also captured practicing free-kicks with Khan.

And it's fair to say the boxer should focus his energy on earning a fight with Floyd Mayweather Jr.
