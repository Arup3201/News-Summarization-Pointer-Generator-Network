UN weapons inspectors will put Syrian president Bashar al-Assad in the frame for the gas attack that killed 1,400 civilians, but will only be able to provide circumstantial evidence, insiders have said.

A senior Western official said the team had collected a 'wealth' of evidence that nerve agents had been used last month's atrocity in Damascus.

A highly anticipated report on the findings, expected to be presented to UN Secretary General Ban Ki-Moon on Monday, will not directly accuse Assad, according to three U.N.-based diplomats familiar with the investigation.

But it will present a strong circumstantial case that the regime was responsible based on analysis of rocket shells, ammunition and tests on soil, blood and urine from the al Ghouta suburb of the capital.

The Western official, who has knowledge of the investigation, told Foreign Policy Magazine: 'I know they have gotten very rich samples - biomedical and environmental - and they have interviewed victims, doctors and nurses.

'It seems they are very happy with the wealth of evidence they got. You can conclude from the type of evidence the [identity of the] author.'

The official, who declined to be named, did not reveal the specific agents found by the team.

Both Syria and their Russian allies have previously claimed that the rebels were responsible for the attacks and that they have evidence to prove it.

It is believed the report could easily become a bargaining chip in talks between Moscow and Western powers on conditions for Syria to give up its chemical weapons and the terms of a United Nations Security Council resolution on the matter.

Two Western diplomats said they strongly expected chief U.N. investigator Ake Sellstrom's report would confirm the U.S. view that sarin gas was used in the attack on suburbs of Damascus that killed hundreds.

'We expect it (the report) will have a narrative of evidence,' said one U.N. official.

Russian President Vladimir Putin, in an opinion piece in the New York Times, confirmed Moscow's view that there was 'every reason to believe' the poison gas was used by rebels.

The United Nations has repeatedly declined to comment on the expected contents of the report. Syria's U.N. Ambassador Bashar Ja'afari did not respond immediately to a request for comment.

The news comes as it emerged that vital weapons shipments from the United States have begun to arrive in rebel fighting units that oppose President Assad, according to sources on both ends of the transactions.

The light arms, ammunition and other small, trackable armaments – likely grenades, mortars and shells – are coming via clandestine CIA operations in a significant escalation of U.S. involvement in the 30-month-long civil war.

The White House promised in June that it would arm anti-Assad forces who were not aligned with Islamist radical groups, authorizing the CIA to do the heavy lifting and manage the pipeline.

But the long-awaited weapons delivery comes at an awkward moment, a day after President Obama pledged to pursue diplomacy instead of military action.
