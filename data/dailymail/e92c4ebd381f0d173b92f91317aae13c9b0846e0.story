An Englishman’s home has long supposedly been his castle.

But a council has ruled he cannot make it look like a wooden fort – even if he claims it is a vital defence necessary to make his children feel safe.

That is what happened at this terrace house in North London, where owner Andy Martin (who is in fact Australian) installed a 6ft 5in fence around his front garden, without planning permission. 

Fenced off: Neighbours complained that the wooden barricade around the front garden made the house look like a sinister fortress

Mr Martin is an architect who has worked for rock star Noel Gallagher and a number of fashionable restaurants.

But his wooden stockade for his own home did not win acclaim from neighbours, who claimed it made the house look like a sinister and ‘aggressive’ fortress, was out of character with the street, and could actually be a magnet for burglars – who could hide behind it.

After Mr Martin was told to apply for retrospective planning permission, his barricade was rejected. He will now have to take it down, yet is mystified at the opposition.

Mr Martin, an Australian architect, has been told to remove the fence 

Mr Martin, who bought the property for £620,000 in 2012, talked about his home in The London Magazine last year, describing it as ‘the ugly house’. 

But he claims that the palisade he erected around it early this year was actually a thing of beauty, and that the area would be improved if more homeowners followed his lead.

Asked why he had built the barricade, Mr Martin said it was created to protect his family. ‘We had some problems with someone being chased into our house late at night, and it’s put my young children in a situation where they are quite nervous now,’ he said.

‘It’s really helped for them. It gives us a lot more security. 

'It gives us two lines of defence before entering the house. I’m not sure why it has been so radically opposed.’

Mr Martin claimed there were ‘four or five others’ in the area, adding that having a street full of such front fences would be ‘very beautiful’.

He added: ‘In my opinion that street is a little bit of a disaster.

'It feels like a car park – people pour concrete in their front yards. It’s not a great example of streetscape.’ 

Mr Martin put the fence up around his house to make his children feel more safe after someone was 'chased into the house' late one night 

'Modest': Mr Martin said the fence was an improvement on the street in North London where he lives 

But neighbour Paula Garcia, 43, said: ‘It’s like a little prison, not a house.

‘To change the look of the road is not nice. When the milkman or builders come over they always ask, “Why are these people doing this?” ’

IT worker Dilip Hirani, 52, described the fortress house as ‘an eyesore’ and said: ‘I don’t know what they are protecting. 

'They must be running around naked or something.’

Writer Shyama Perera, another neighbour, said: ‘It ruins the look of the street and I’m worried others will follow suit. 

'It’s not appropriate.’

In Mr Martin’s belated planning application, he described his fence as ‘a modest’ construction.

His application concluded that ‘the fence improves the front forecourt area and is a neat design response to what was just a concrete driveway with minimal landscaping’.

But the planning application was rejected last week by Brent Council, which said it had ‘a significantly unacceptable visual impact’.

A spokesman for the council said that planning permission was required for a fence or wall to the front of a property which would be more than one metre, or 3ft 3in, high.
