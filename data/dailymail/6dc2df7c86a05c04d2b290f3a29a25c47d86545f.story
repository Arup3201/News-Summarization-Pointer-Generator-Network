Millions of British holidaymakers will enjoy cheaper European breaks this summer with the euro forecast to plunge to a 13-year low against the pound.

Families will get far more ‘bang for their buck’ over the next few months after it was announced that around £850billion will be pumped into the eurozone’s struggling economy.

The injection of cash by the European Central Bank will lower the value of the euro. This means everything from restaurant meals and sightseeing tours to hotel stays and property will be cheaper for Britons.

The ECB’s money-printing programme – known as quantitative easing – will not begin until March, but the euro has fallen against the pound in anticipation, meaning Britons are already benefiting.

Today, £1 will buy 1.34 euros – the highest figure for seven years – compared with only 1.17 euros last year and 1.06 euros in 2009.

And experts believe the euro will continue to fall. They predict that by July £1 could buy up to 1.55 euros, a 13-year high. 

That means that buying 500 euros in the summer could cost £322, compared with £400 at the same time last year.

The news is likely to lead to a rush on European breaks rather than ‘staycations’ or trips to the US. 

Daily Mail research found that at this exchange rate a family of four could save £245 on a seven-night city break in Paris this July compared with July last year.

Economist Harry Adams, at foreign exchange specialists Argentex, said: ‘The euro has already considerably weakened against the pound and will continue to do so over the next six months. 

'We estimate that by July, we could be seeing the euro at about 1.55 against the pound – the cheapest the euro has been since 2002.’

Economist Ben Brettell, of financial advisers Hargreaves Lansdown, said: ‘Quantitative easing will increase the supply of euros into the European financial system, reducing the price of it.’ 

Although the weaker euro will help holidaymakers, it is bad for businesses that export to Europe, because it means their goods are more expensive to buy for customers on the Continent. 

As a result they may sell less in the eurozone.

Quantitative easing will continue until at least September next year. It is a last-ditch bid to kick-start growth and step up the fight against deflation.

The European Central Bank will inject around £45billion a month into the eurozone’s financial system by buying up government and corporate bonds across the 19 countries of the single currency bloc. 

But it will be printing only 20 per cent of the cash, leaving decisions on the rest to national banks throughout the zone.

Greece, in particular, has struggled through a deep recession and a quarter of its workforce is unemployed.

Its economic situation is so dire that it has been locked out of the latest quantitative easing for now because of limits on how much debt its central bank can buy.

The Left-wing party Syriza is expected to win Greece’s general election tomorrow. Its leader, Alexis Tsipras, wants to end austerity measures and is calling for most of Greece’s debt to be written off.

This would be unpopular with other EU leaders and some experts believe that if a compromise cannot be reached then Greece could default on its debt and even leave the euro.
