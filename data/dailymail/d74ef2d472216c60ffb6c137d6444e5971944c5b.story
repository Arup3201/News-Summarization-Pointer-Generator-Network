Children across the UK are increasingly being targeted by mobile phone thieves, new figures have revealed.

London is the worst affected area, where 10,000 phones are stolen every month, with two thirds of victims aged between 13 and 16.

The rise in popularity of high value smartphones, which thieves can easily resell for cash, is a major contributory factor in these shocking figures.

The rise of young children using smartphones such as the iPhone, has led to a rise in mobile phone thefts as robbers can resell the expensive devices easily

More than 170 iPhones are stolen every day in London, but as the figures, obtained from the Freedom of Information Act by The Times, show it is a problem affecting the whole country.

In Nottinghamshire more than 40 per cent of mobile phone thefts were from people under 21, and in Cheshire the figure is 35 per cent.

In Hertfordshire 32 per cent of the victims of mobile phone theft were under 20, and the figure for the same age group in Cumbria is 28 per cent.

The figures also show that children as young as six have been victims of this crime.

Hertfordshire
 Police reported one case where a three-year-old was the victim, the old
 mobile phone had been given to the child as a toy.

One area of advice to parents wanting their children to have a mobile phone is to give your child a model that is slightly older or less desirable to thieves

Police have been stationed outside some 
schools to help reduce the number of thefts, with other schools even 
taking the precaution of providing self-defence classes to keep their 
pupils safe in the event of a robbery.

In Humberside mobile phone theft affecting 10 to 15-year-olds increased 40 per cent last year and in Kent thefts from 16 to 20-year-olds have risen by 30 per cent in the last three years.

Keith Hayward, Professor of Criminology at the University of Kent told the Times: 'No one below the age of 10 carried phones around 10 years ago. Now it's a common occurrence.

'Parents give their children a mobile phone because they feel it will make them safe, but ironically it can lead to increasingly victimisation.

'Criminals only steal items that are desirable and that they can sell, and kids are easy targets. perhaps it would be best to give them a phone that is not the top of the range.'

The police are struggling to get to grips with the problem because of the sheer number of cases they are faced with.

In many instances the crime isn't even reported to the police by victims.

Between 2009 and 2011, Hertfordshire Police had 11,027 cases of mobile phone theft.

In only five cases were charges brought, and figures also revealed only 77 offenders were cautioned for the offence in that period.

In the same time period Thames Valley Police had 34,439 cases of mobile phone theft reported to them. Again, only five per cent of cases saw a charges being brought.
