Most will be familiar with the advances in technology, industry and trade made during the Georgian period but few realise that the era ushered in a revolution of a different kind - in fashion, media and shopping.

Among the men responsible was Thomas Chippendale, a furniture maker whose work, detailed in his groundbreaking 1774 tome, The Gentleman and Cabinet Maker's Directory, went on to become a byword for good taste.

His catalogue, which is filled with examples of his work, was the first of its type and forms part of a new exhibition at The British Library entitled: Georgians Revealed: Life, Style and the Making of Modern Britain.

But it's not all catalogues and chairs: the exhibition also includes some of the first ever British fashion magazines, enormous interior design portfolios by the Adam brothers and the UK’s first celebrity scandal, which was published in some of the country's first tabloids.

Other unusual pieces on show include a dashing pair of red leather men's shoes, a stunning silken carnival mask and illustrations detailing the newly popular pastimes of shopping and balls.

The most notorious woman to appear in the exhibition is Fanny Murray, the mistress of John Montagu, 4th Earl of Sandwich, and the star of an early tabloid sensation.

Her wanton antics inspired a pornographic poem entitled An Essay on Women, a parody of Alexander Pope's An Essay on Man, which was written by John Wilkes, an early press pioneer.

When the ditty was discovered, more than a decade after being written, it caused a scandal. Wilkes, who was already in trouble with Parliament after writing a disobliging article about the monarch, was forced to flee abroad to escape further obscenity charges.

While the scandalous antics of Wilkes and Murray form one of the most eye-catching parts of the display, the exhibition also focuses on other, more innocent pastimes popularised by the Georgians.

Among them were following fashion, shopping, gardening and sports, as well as less wholesome pursuits such as theatre, dance and celebrity gossip.

Speaking about the exhibition, Dr Moira Goff, lead curator, said: 'We’re thrilled to be telling these fascinating stories from the Georgian period, a somewhat overlooked era.

'We’re showing off the Library’s unbeatable 18th and 19th century printed collections, from everyday throw away adverts, tickets and receipts, to gargantuan and exquisitely illustrated books that King George III himself would have treasured.

'We hope visitors will enjoy the exhibition’s playful atmosphere and make the connections between then and now that really bring the period to life.’Accompanying the Library’s collections will be historic objects from the period, including Van Aken’s ‘An English Family at Tea’ from Tate Britain, elegant furniture and crockery from the V&A and a masquerade mask and picnic hamper from the Museum of London.

Georgians Revealed: Life, Style and the Making of Modern Britain runs until the 11th March at the British Library. Tickets cost £9 for adults and concessions are available.
