A man who murdered two government officials for refusing to register the birth of his fourth child has been sentenced to death.

He Shenguo, 33, was denied citizenship papers for the newborn because he had not paid a Â£26,500 fine for violating China's one-child policy.

In a fit of rage, he unleashed a machete at the family planning office in Guangxi, south China, leaving two dead and four seriously injured.

Death sentence: He Shenguo, 33, killed two government officials for refusing to register the birth of his fourth child. He has now been found guilty of intentional homicide and sentenced to death

Goodbye: Here, He is kissed goodbye by his wife, the mother of his three daughters and one son

One lost a hand in the attack in July last year.

Without the documents the baby would be denied schooling, social benefits, and the chance to 
eventually work or sign any sort of formal contract.

The penalty, introduced in China thirty years ago, is used to prevent urban families from having more than one child.

Rural families can have two if the first is a girl.

Crazed: He attacked all in his path, leaving two dead and four seriously injured, with one missing a hand

Approach: This CCTV footage shows Shenguo advancing on the office with his weapon to exact his revenge

Today, Shenguo, who has three daughters and one son, was sentenced to death.

Shenguo, who is certified mentally disabled, will not appeal the ruling, which found him guilty of two counts of murder.

The court heard he burst into the Dongxing City Population and Family Planning Bureau attacking anyone in his path.

Footage of police trying to subdue the man while he brandished a machete last July was widely shared on social media.

Many comments at the time voiced sympathy for him and opposition to China's family planning limits.

Aftermath: The clinic was left covered in blood after Shenguo's rampage. He said he will not appeal his sentence
