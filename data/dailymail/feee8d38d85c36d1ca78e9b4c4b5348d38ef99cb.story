A mother has been accused of caring more about alcohol than the son she allegedly starved to death after she turned up to court so drunk yesterday that her manslaughter trial could not go ahead.

Amanda Hutton, 43, is accused of manslaughter of her son Hamzah Khan after his mummified remains were found in his cot next to a teddy bear.

Jurors heard how Hutton turned up to court so drunk on Monday morning that she was in no fit state to hear evidence and her trial had to be postponed.

Police had to escort her to Bradford Crown Court, but despite being given a morning to sober up in cells, she was still too drunk to take to the dock in the afternoon.

In the witness box today, Hutton admitted she hit the bottle on Sunday night after a phone call with her ex Aftab Khan, and admitted she could not remember how much she drank.

She said: 'It really rocked me. I had been coping quite well and was being strong through this trial. I did have something to drink, but I don't know how much.'

Her barrister Stephen Meadowcroft QC asked her: 'Were you fit to come to court?' Hutton replied: 'In hindsight, no.'

Prosecutor Paul Greaney QC accused Hutton of thinking more about alcohol than Hamzah.

Mr Greaney said to her: 'For a substantial period before Hamzah died, drinking was more important to you than his welfare.' Hutton replied: 'No, that's not true.'

The prosecutor said: 'You cared more about alcohol than you did about that child.' The defendant said: 'Not at all.'

Earlier in the hearing today, Hutton sobbed in the witness stand as she recalled how she discovered Hamzah Khan and kept his mummified remains in a cot for two years.

The prosecution revealed today how Hutton went on with 
her life while her son's tiny body decomposed in her bedroom because she 'cared more about alcohol than her child'.

Hamzah died in December 2009 but was not found by police until September 2011, who were called after complaints from neighbours.

In the dock: Amanda Hutton today described how her son Hamzah Khan died and was kept in her room for two years

Bradford Crown Court has heard that within hours of his death she 
ordered a pizza and continued to claim child benefit in his name to help pay for her alcohol.

Describing when he died, the 43-year-old today said she was at Morrisons supermarket when she got a 
call from her grown-up son Tariq to say Hamzah's eyes were rolling back 
into his head.

Hutton, 43, said: 'I rushed upstairs to my bedroom and found Hamzah had passed away.

'I picked him up and checked all his pulse points and there was nothing.

'I tried to give him mouth-to-mouth but that wasn't working.'

Tragedy: Amanda Hutton's four-year-old son Hamzah Khan was found dead at her home in Bradford

She said: 'I picked him up from my bed and put him over my shoulder and brown vomit came out of him, from his mouth.'

Hutton said wanted to call the police but Tariq stopped her.

Asked why, she said: 'I'm not sure.'

Hutton was asked what she did after Hamzah died.

'I stayed in my bedroom all night with him,' she said.

'I held him for hours.'

Terrible discovery: Police were called to Hutton's Bradford home and discovered her son, who had been dead for two years

Hutton,
who denies manslaughter, gave her evidence in a quiet voice, facing the
jury in a black skirt, black top and black cardigan.

Hutton said she began drinking heavily after Hamzah's death. She said she slept on the sofa.

Hutton said: 'I just didn't know what to do.'

She agreed that she had continued to claim child benefit for Hamzah after his death.

But Hutton told the jury this was because she thought questions would be asked if she stopped claiming.

Paul
Greaney QC, prosecuting, asked her: 'You had a four-and-a-half-year-old
child that fitted into a baby-gro for a six to nine-month-old baby, 
that hadn't been eating and you didn't seek medical attention for him.'

The prosecutor showed the defendant a photograph of the baby-gro Hamzah's body was found in, as he asked the question.

She replied: 'No I didn't.'

Mr Greaney asked her whether she thought this was a breach of the responsibility she had for her child.

Hutton said she believed Hamzah would grow out of his eating problems, just like his elder brother, Qaiser, who is now an adult.

Hutton
denied drinking heavily before Hamzah's death. Mr Greaney said to her: 
'For a substantial period before Hamzah died drinking was more important
to you than his welfare.'

Hutton replied: 'No, that's not true.'

The prosecutor said: 'You cared more about alcohol than you did about that child.'

Hutton said: 'Not at all.'

She denied locking Hamzah in a room in the dark as a punishment.

Mr Greaney said: 'Not only did you neglect him, you abused him.'

She replied: 'No, never.'

Hutton also denied referring to Hamzah as a 'silly bastard'.

Mr Greaney asked the defendant: 'Do you accept he died because he was malnourished?'

She shook her head and said: 'Without sounding flippant, I'm not an expert. I don't know the cause.'

Hutton added: 'I don't think he did. I'm not sure.'

The trial continues.
