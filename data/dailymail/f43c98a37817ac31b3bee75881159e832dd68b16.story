Fuming: Mother-of-four Janet Mee suffered chipped bones in her spine after being knocked down by driver John Kershaw

A mother has described how her life has been 'ruined' after she was knocked down by a hit-and-run driver - but the man responsible has walked free from court with little more than a slap on the wrist.

Janet Mee, 49, was left temporarily paralysed after chipping bones in her spine following the accident in Burnley, Lancashire.

John Kershaw, 65, 'squashed' her between two cars as he drove past in his Vauxhall Insignia.

Mrs Mee said she had just picked up her two children Danel, five, and Anneliese, three, from nursery when she was hurt.

She still struggles to walk following the accident on December 13 last year and is not even able to play with her children.

Police had to issue two please for information before Kershaw was tracked down, but he was fined just £100 as well being given a two-year conditional discharge and six penalty points by magistrates.

Mrs Gee reacted to the sentence saying: 'Six points on a driving licence is a massive insult given that he drove away after hitting me in the street.

'I'm just grateful he didn't hit the children - they could have been killed after what he did.'

Mrs Mee said her children were left in tears following the accident.

Despite knowing he had hit Mrs Mee, Kershaw drove off with his wheels spinning. His defence lawyer told the court he thought he had seen Mrs Mee get back up and didn't feel he needed to stop.

Speaking about the accident, Mrs Gee said: 'Everything
from that moment changed and I went from being buoyant and happy to 
everything crumbling. The stark reality was that everything changed, I 
am now a person who needs bathing and washing.

'The
bones in my back have been left chipped and I have been told that I 
will never walk properly again. I can't do anything, I can't drive.

'I 
even have trouble taking my socks and boots off and any garments below 
the waist. It is very frustrating. I can't do day to day things the pain
is so severe.

'I want to 
play with the kids but I can't, I have cried so many tears. Daniel 
understands and now he brings his toys to me, he's always wanting to do 
things for me and wants to make me a cup of tea.

'Once upon a time I 
would be sat on the floor playing with them. This man has ruined my life.'

Let off: John Kershaw, left, was given just six points on his licence and £100 fine after he knocked down mother Janet Mee, right, outside a nursery

Mrs
Mee, a mature student, was initially left paralysed from the waist down
and treated in hospital for chipped bones in her spine following the 
incident.

Kershaw pleaded guilty to driving without due 
care and attention and failing to report a road accident.

In court Miss Parveen Akhtar, prosecuting
said Kershaw stopped for two or three seconds about two car lengths 
away after the impact but drove off quickly, with the wheels spinning.

Kershaw's
defence lawyer David Leach told the court his client knew he had caught
Mrs Mee with his wing mirror but said he didn't see her fall to the 
ground.

Mr Leach said 
Kershaw saw Mrs Mee on her feet after hitting her and felt he had no 
reason to get out of his car and make any inquiries.

The
lawyer added: 'He is not a boy racer. He is a senior citizen. He is 
horrified to find she has been in hospital. He is genuinely remorseful 
for the injuries this lady has suffered.'
