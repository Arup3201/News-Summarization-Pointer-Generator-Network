President Barack Obama is the 'weakest' U.S. president since Franklin Delano Roosevelt, according to former Vice President Dick Cheney.

Speaking Wednesday night on Fox News, the 73-year-old Republican said the rest of the world – especially in the Middle East – has lost respect for the United States under Obama's leadership.

'I think the perception around the world is increasingly negative, Sean' he told host Sean Hannity, 'but I think the main focus is on our president.'

'He's a very, very weak president, maybe the weakest – certainly in my lifetime.'

Dick Cheney slammed the Obama administration for its handling of the Middle East: 'We've got a problem with weakness. It's centered right in the White House.'

Foreign policy: Obama said Wednesday that the U.S. will move toward a complete withdrawal from Afghanistan and rely more on NATO and the UN to help practice 'American leadership'

Foreign powers 'all are absolutely convinced that the American capacity to lead and influence in that part of the world has been dramatically reduced by this president,' he claimed.

'We've got a problem with weakness. It's centered right in the White House.'

During a commencement speech Wednesday at the U.S. Military Academy at West Point, Obama confirmed his plans to pull most of the remaining U.S. troops out of Afghanistan.

He also emphasized American reliance on international coalitions like NATO and the UN as 'American strength, American leadership.'

'He's prepared to pull out, at this 
point, all of our capability in Afghanistan and not negotiate a 
stay-behind agreement,' Cheney responded.

'That’s stupid, unwise and will in 
fact just reinforce the notion that we're weak and that we have a 
president that doesn't understand his obligations.'

The former vice president, who served under President George W. Bush for two terms, said Obama is 'totally ignoring' why the U.S. invaded Afghanistan.

'It’s as though he wasn't even around when 9/11 happened,' he said.

Not up to snuff: Former VP Dick Cheney said Obama is the weakest U.S. president since FDR

The former VP told Fox News host Sean Hannity that Obama's planned Afghanistan withdrawal is 'stupid' and 'unwise'

Hannity noted that the president has 'given three speeches in three days about the military,' and checked off a list of foreign affairs and military scandals that he said the president hasn't adequately addressed.

'We've outed a CIA operative in Afghanistan, we have a VA scandal that is breathtaking in terms of how inappropriate it is for our vets,' he said.

The VA scandal is an 'outrage,' Cheney said, mocking the White House and senior congressional Democrats for blaming the agency's health care crisis on him and Bush.

It has been 'six years out since we left office,' he fumed, 'and we are still blamed by Nancy Pelosi and Barack Obama for their current troubles.'

The White House did not respond to a request for comment.
