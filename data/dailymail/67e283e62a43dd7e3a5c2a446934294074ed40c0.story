This is the heart-wrenching moment that a mother was forced to throw her two children out of a fourth floor window as fire ravaged their home.

Mila Aksakova, 36, was caught on camera hurtling the children towards the street in a drastic bid to save them from the blaze.

Neighbours in the village of Energetic, in the Russian Republic of Baskkortostan, looked on as Vanya, four, and Natalya, 13, were launched from the window, after the apartment's exit became cut off by flames.

Mila Aksakova, 36, from Energetic, Russia, was forced to throw her two children out of their fourth floor apartment window to escape a fire

The mother-of-two hurled the two children to the ground below, where neighbours were waiting with taut bedsheets to catch them

The recording, taken from across the road from the block of flats, shows the children tumbling towards the street, where other residents waited to catch them with taut bedsheets.

Luckily, the rescue was successful and both children survived.

The desperate mother, who was worried the sheets would not hold her weight, did not jump from the open window.

She waited inside the flat, hoping the firefighters would reach her in time but was overcome by fumes.

However, she was rescued by firefighters when they arrived on the scene.

She was pulled from the burning building and treated for smoke inhalation.

More than 140 other people had to be evacuated from the burning building.

Dozens of neighbours watched on in the small village, as the children jumped to their safety

Fire brigade spokesman Damian Bulgakov, 43, said: 'The fire started in the ground floor flat where a disabled woman had been living.

'We are not sure exactly what caused it yet and are still investigating that.

'The problem for the family was that by the time they noticed the fire, it had cut off their opportunity to escape through the front door and that meant they had to use the windows.

'With smoke filling the flat, the mother made a decision to at least get her kids out before it was too late.'

The mother decided not to jump, incase the bedsheets did not hold her weight. She was rescued by firefighters and treated for smoke inhalation
