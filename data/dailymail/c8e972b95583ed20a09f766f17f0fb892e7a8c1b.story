He made history as the first Indian chef to receive a Michelin star for his first London restaurant Tamarind in 2001 - and  he did the same again in 2007 for his second venture, Benares.

Atul Kochhar, who is widely regarded as one of the best chefs in the country, grew up in a foodie family in Jamshedpur, India, alongside his six siblings.

Now, the 44-year-old has written his fourth cookbook, Benares, named after his Mayfair restaurant, which aims to share his unique approach to fine dining.

The restaurant serves modern-Indian British-inspired dishes such as chicken tikka pie with wild berry chutney, Punjabi style seabass and chips served with cumin tempered peas and spiced tomato sauce, and scrambled duck egg served with Cornish mackerel.

The chef and restaurateur spoke to FEMAIL about growing up in India, his philosophy of cuisine, and his tips for cooking Indian food at home.

In India, you grew up in a foodie family. Did you automatically want to become a chef?

No, I wanted to be a cricketer but that didn't happen unfortunately. Growing up in a household where there were six of us - five sisters and a younger brother - food was always around us. 

India produces around 2,000 varieties of mangoes, and going through different mangoes through the seasons was a heck of a thing. 

My family was very into it; my dad was very passionate about mangoes. He would make us taste them and that was a great learning.

What did you want to achieve when you moved to Britain?

When I arrived, I saw Indian food really in the dark ages. The way it was seen here, it was just curry. But I landed in the right place at the right time. 

The UK was about to become the melting pot of cuisines. 

There were chefs like Marco Pierre White, Gordon Ramsey,  Nico Ladenis and many more who were  changing the cuisine in this country and I kind of became part of the movement.

As Benares is the subject of your new cookbook, what contributions do you feel the restaurant has made to the British food scene?

We have adapted and adopted - the culture, the cuisine, the ingredients - and brought two diverse cultures closer. 

We see ourselves as a British Indian restaurant and we're very proud of it.

We've seen an influx of food trends in Britain in the past decade. Has that affected they way you cook now?

To me, it's inspirational. There are ingredients that are not from my cuisine, but I'm motivated to bring that into my food. Something like chia seeds, which is a hotly debated topic at the moment. 

It's a super food and we use chia seed in making a drink in India. But I created a dessert out of it. So, you come back into main play again and you're on trend.

What are your tips for cooking Indian style cuisine?

The simpler, the better. And get to know spices and start cooking with them. 

Always use spices as if you're using salt and pepper. If you go beyond that, perhaps you'll shock your system and you won't go back.

Mangsho Kukni (lamb rump and chick peas)

This is a very traditional recipe of meat curry but instead of using diced meat, I have used lamb rump. This only changes the appearance of the preparation, not the flavour profile.

Serves four

Preparation time: 20 minutes

Cooking time: 30 minutes

Ingredients for the chickpeas:  150g chickpeas, soaked in water overnight; one bay leaf; one black cardamom; one clove; one teaspoon salt

For the lamb rump: 100ml vegetable or mustard oil; six cloves; two bay leaves; three black cardamom; 200g onions, sliced; 15g ginger-garlic paste; one teaspoon coriander powder; one teaspoon red chilli powder; one teaspoon cumin powder; one teaspoon salt; 200 grams tomatoes, chopped; four lamb leg steaks(100 grams X 4); two tablespoons coriander leaves, chopped; half a teaspoon Bengali garam masala. 

To finish: Two tablespoons mixed spices (coriander seeds, cumin seeds, sesame seeds, black pepper); one tablespoon Dijon mustard; mixed cress for garnish.   

Method

1. Soak chickpeas in water and salt overnight. Drain the water and start with fresh water and spices and boil the chickpeas until cooked. Set aside until required.

2. In a separate pan heat oil and saute cloves, bay leaf and black cardamom. Add sliced onions and saute until translucent, add ginger-garlic paste and cook well. Add dried powdered spices, tomatoes and lamb steaks and add enough water to cover the mixture, cook until lamb is tender.

3. Add chickpeas and simmer until lamb is three-quarters cooked. Separate the rump from the chickpeas. Brush the rump with Dijon mustard paste and roll it over crackled-pounded spices. Roast in medium hot oven for five to six minutes and remove. Place chickpeas and sit rump on top garnished with mixed cress. Serve hot with some rice or bread.
