A teenager has not eaten a meal for almost five years because she has a rare condition which paralyses her stomach.

Ayllah-Beau Foley, 19, from Cheltenham, Gloucestershire, has been in agony for years since she developed gastroparesis - a rare condition which paralyses the stomach muscles.

The teenager is now only able to eat the tiniest amounts of food and is fed through a feeding tube directly to her bloodstream.

Ayllah-Beau said: ‘Having this condition has really changed my life.

‘I can’t sit down for meals with my family anymore, I can’t eat out with my friends - I can’t even tuck into a Sunday lunch.

‘I have a twin brother, Jordan, but we can’t eat cake together on our birthday - if I tried, I’d just be sick.

‘It is really hard but I try and stay positive, and I just hope I can beat this horrible illness one day.’

Ayllah-Beau’s condition first developed when she returned from a volunteering project in India.

She said: ‘I was so excited to go to India with school and I couldn’t wait to get out there and get stuck in.

‘But when I came back I just felt awful and started to get really ill.

‘I assumed it was just food poisoning I’d picked up out there, but it just got worse and worse.’

Gastroparesis is a chronic condition in which the stomach is unable to empty in the normal way.

Symptoms including feeling sick and vomiting when eating, bloating, loss of appetite and weight loss.

The problem is thought to be caused by a problem with the nerves or muscles controlling the emptying of the stomach.

In many cases, the cause of this nerve damage is unknown but it can also be caused by poorly controlled diabetes.

Other possible causes include Parkinson's disease, multiple sclerosis and some medications.

The condition cannot be cured but it can usually be controlled.

Some people are able to manage the condition by changing their diet, for example by eating six small meals a day or by sticking to soft, easily digestible foods.

In some cases, symptoms can be improved with medication but other people require injections of Botox into the valve between their stomach and small intestine.

If all of these options fail, a patient can have a new procedure which involves fitting a pacemaker device to encourage the stomach to process food.

If none of these options succeed in making the stomach process food, the patient will have to be fed through a tube.

It soon became clear that Ayllah-Beau needed medical attention, and her parents took her to the doctors.

Her
 mother and full-time carer, Christine, 46, said: ‘At first we assumed 
that Beau just had Delhi belly - something that she’d picked up when she
 was out there, but she wasn’t getting any better.

‘Eventually we took her to the doctors but they seemed stumped too.

‘At first they thought it was something to do with her appendix, but they did an operation and couldn’t find anything.

‘Then they thought it might be gynaecological but again that wasn’t the answer.

‘Medics even began to suggest that Beau’s condition could be psychological.

‘We were quite annoyed that there was a suggestion that this was all in her head, when that quite clearly wasn’t the case.’

After further tests and examinations Ayllah-Beau was finally diagnosed with gastroparesis.

Her mother said: ‘We were shocked to hear that her stomach muscles were paralysed - we had no idea that something like that was even possible, but it was a relief to get a diagnosis too.

‘Beau had lost about three stone in weight, so it was great to think that something was finally going to be done and she could get better.

‘But it soon became apparent that this wasn’t the kind of diagnosis we had wanted.’

Ayllah-Beau has tried various treatments since her diagnosis, including a feeding tube directly into her bowel, and a gastric pacemaker, but none have cured her condition.

The gastric pacemaker sent electrical pulses to her stomach to try and stimulate the muscles, but it failed to help her.

She now relies on a feeding tube that sends nutrients straight into her bloodstream through a drip in a vein.

This means the nutrition bypasses her normal digestive system altogether.

Doctors were initially baffled by Ayllah-Beau's illness and even suggested it could be psychological

Her mother said: ‘The tube she has now feeds nutrients into her jugular vein and transports them to her heart and the rest of the bloodstream.

‘She is fed for 14 hours overnight to keep her alive.

‘At the moment that is the best treatment that she can have, and we just have to hope that there is something better around the corner.’

But despite being fed essential nutrients, Ayllah-Beau still wishes she could eat like everybody else.

She said: ‘I still get cravings for things like chocolate, sweets and burgers.

‘I might have a teeny tiny bite every now and then, just to satisfy the craving, but it’s not the same.

‘It’s horrible because I used to love different foods so much, and now I can’t have any of them.

‘I’m exhausted all the time, so I have to see what my friends get up to from Facebook.

‘My twin brother, Jordan, is a soldier and sometimes it can be difficult seeing him so active when I’m cooped up in bed all the time - but of course I’m so proud of him.

‘I’ve come to accept my condition now and I take each day as it comes.

‘I hope that one day, I’ll be back to my normal self, but for now I try to stay as positive as I can.’

Dr Simon Gabe, a Consultant 
Gastroenterologist at St Mark’s Hospital, in Harrow, who treats 
Ayllah-Beau said: ‘Gastroparesis is rare. It is a condition describing 
weakness of the muscles of the stomach, meaning that the food in the 
stomach does not empty well.

‘This results in a feeling of fullness that continues for longer than normal, nausea and vomiting. Patients will lose weight as a result.

‘It is estimated that it affects one in 50,000 of the population and is more common in women than men.

‘The commonest cause is diabetes, occurring in diabetics who have had poor diabetic control over many years.

Ayllah-Beau desperately hopes she will eventually be able to eat normally again

Ayllah-Beau's illness means she is exhausted all the time and she says it is hard not to be able to go out with her friends. Image shows tubes entering her stomach before she started being fed through a vein in her neck

‘However, there is an increasing group of patients that have gastroparesis as part of a problem affecting the whole of the gut - when the nerves or muscles in the gut do not work in a coordinated way. This causes abdominal pain, vomiting and weight loss.

‘This is a dysmotility of the gut and while there are a number of possible causes, generally we do not know the cause and this is called Chronic Idiopathic Intestinal Pseudoobstruction (CIIP).

‘This is a young group of patients and the symptoms of gastroparesis are often missed. Poor appetite, vomiting and weight loss in young women may be considered to be an eating disorder, but for some of these patients gastroparesis may play a part.’
