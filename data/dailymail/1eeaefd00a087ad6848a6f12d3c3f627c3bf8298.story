A school has disciplined 11 pupils after it deemed their shiny black leather Kickers against its uniform policy.

Within minutes of arriving at Outwood Academy in Acklam, Middlesborough, on Friday, several pupils had been sent back home for wearing 'incorrect' footwear. 

The secondary school, which has 860 pupils, states that only plain black shoes are allowed and trainers, boots, pumps or canvas shoes are banned. 

Almost a dozen pupils were sent home from Outwood Academy in Acklam, Middlesborough, for wearing 'incorrect' footwear to school after a crackdown on uniform policy

Parents have blasted the school after most of the students were wearing plain black laced Kicker shoes

It decided to revisit its policy as part of a drive to improve standards at the previously failing school and a letter was sent out reminding parents what it considered to be 'correct' footwear, last week.

But parents have blasted the academy, saying their children's shoes were plain black and from the range marketed for school wear. 

The letter, issued on Wednesday, read: 'Students should be wearing black shoes that can be polished. Any other colours of shoes, trainers or boots of any description are not permitted.' 

Maddie Hayes, 14, was among a number of students excluded on Friday, despite having worn the same brand of plain black shoe for the last three years.

Her mother, Jackie Hayes, 37, who also has a nine-year-old daughter, said: 'I received a call from Maddie's school to say she was being excluded for the day for not wearing the right shoes.

'I couldn't believe what I was hearing because she has only ever worn plain black Kickers shoes which are sold as a popular school shoe.

Miss Hayes, a travel agent from Coulby Newham, said her daughter was one of more than 20 pupils either sent home or put in isolation for wearing the wrong school attire.

'When I got to the school Maddie said she was at first given a detention and was given a pair of shoes by the school to put on. But when she refused she was told she was excluded.

'Attendance at the school is already a major issue yet they are sending kids home. Fair enough if the shoes were brightly coloured or had high heels, but Maddie's are plain, basic, black shoes.'

But executive principal, Rob Tarn, said some of the shoes were boots, which is against the school's rules. 

He said: 'Nothing has changed here, we have always been clear regarding our requirements with uniform and our Acklam academy has high expectations of student behaviour.

'This includes our clear guidance on footwear which has been shared with parents on a number of occasions.

'Students whose footwear does not meet the requirements are asked if they wish to borrow a pair of shoes bought by the academy until they can purchase a more appropriate pair for themselves, a request which we deem to be reasonable.

'Part of the reason that examination results are rising so rapidly is that staff can focus on conversations about learning rather than have repeated conversations about compliance with uniform which is tremendously distracting. 

'I would ask that parents give us their full support in our attempts to deliver an outstanding education for their children.'  

A spokesperson for Outwood Grange Academies Trust which oversees the school, said: 'The trust has established a clear uniform policy which has been shared extensively with students and their families at the academy. 

'The trust purchased uniform for all students when it opened in 2013 and has an ongoing commitment to purchase uniform for all students joining in Year 7. 

The secondary school's rules states that only plain black shoes are allowed and trainers, boots, pumps or canvas shoes are banned

Several pupils were sent home after refusing to wear another pair of shoes provided for them by the school and other were put in isolation or given a detention

'The trust provides all items of uniform including sports kit and socks, the only item of uniform not provided by the trust is shoes.

'The current issue has arisen as a result of only 11 students who are refusing to wear footwear in line with the academy's uniform policy. 

'The uniform policy clearly states that students must wear shoes that are plain black (this means students cannot wear boots or shoes with logos). 

'The academy has offered to provide alternative footwear for the small number of students concerned and this offer has been declined.

'The trust can confirm that it does not exclude students for wearing incorrect uniform, however, if a student refuses to follow a reasonable request to change their footwear, then this would lead to a fixed term exclusion.' 

Olivia Adams said a teacher cut off the tags to her Kickers shoes while she was still wearing them

Kickers shoes have been at the centre of a uniform row in the past. In November 2013 a teacher at North School in Ashford, Kent, allegedly cut labels off a schoolgirl's shoes.

Olivia Adams, 13, was told the green and red tags broke an 'all-black' uniform rule and her teacher apparently cut them off while she they were still on her feet.

Her mother Claire Pamment immediately complained to head teacher Lesley Ellis - who apologised and offered her £55 to buy a new pair.

But Ms Pammett took the row to police, insisting the staff member committed criminal damage and assault.

The school failed to comment at the time, but police said it was investigating a complaint of criminal damage.

In another bizarre incident, teachers at BBG Academy in Birkenshaw, West Yorkshire, became so fed up with students wearing 'inappropriate footwear' that it took them on a forced shopping trip to a shoe store. 

Pupils were taken to a branch of Wynsors World of Shoes on separate occasions over two weeks in December last year after being deemed to be wearing inappropriate shoes.

Teachers paid £18 for each pair, which about 40 parents were then expected to pay at a later stage. 

Meanwhile, dozens of children were kept in a school hall and missed their lessons for their first day back at a city comprehensive - because they turned up wearing the 'wrong' shoes.

Courtenay Cummings, 13, was among 30 pupils to be kept out of lessons for the day after she turned up to school in her usual black canvas footwear in September last year.

Cantonian High School in Fairwater, Cardiff, insists that letters were sent out in July explaining trainers and 'daps' - rubber-soled canvas shoes - were not acceptable.

In November last year, Hanson Academy in Bradford, West Yorkshire, sent home 152 pupils in one day after they failed to meet new strict uniform policy.

Nearly 10 per cent of pupils failed to meet standards on the first day the rules were introduced and the next day 63 pupils were sent home - taking the total number to 215 in two days.

Several students reported being turned away at the gates for minor infringements such as wearing a winter coat and not displaying their school ID on a lanyard.

A majority of student were sent home for wearing the wrong footwear, Hanson Academy business manager Sarah Roberts said.

Mason Beaumont, 14, was turned away for wearing black leather Magnum made footwear because staff branded them trainers.

Headteacher Elizabeth Churton, who has been at the school for two years, said the rules were not new and staff were simply 'reinforcing the rules that are in place.' 

The Coseley School in Bilston, West Midlands, also sent home around 100 students after arriving at school for the first day of term because their footwear was not 'black leather'. 

Emma Guthrie, who bought a £20 pair of black formal shoes for her son Lewis, 12, said: 'We had a text about the shoes the day before. But that's no good.

'I think it's disgraceful. What have [shoes] got to do with him looking at a blackboard, reading and writing?

'I'm not going out and buying any more, I'm putting my foot down and he's wearing them.' 

In 2011 Cardinal Newham Catholic School in Keresley, Coventry, banned 17 pupils from an important mathematics GCSE exam for wearing the wrong shoes.

Students, aged between 15 and 16, were given their marching orders 20 minutes before they were due to start the test after refusing to change their footwear or take the exam in their socks.

Patrick Doherty, 15, was due to sit the exam again after he failed it last summer having taken it a year early.

He refused to take his shoes off because of fears his feet would smell and now faces a year at home before he can re-sit the exam again.
