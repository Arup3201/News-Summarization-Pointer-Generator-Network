A thigh injury has put paid to Shara Proctor's hopes of long jump glory at the Commonwealth Games.

The British record holder was amongst the favourites for gold at Hampden Park, but was unable to top the podium like England team-mate Greg Rutherford managed in the men's event.

Proctor pulled up during her first sprint down the run way, grabbing her left thigh in clear pain - an injury which forced the 25-year-old to withdraw and puts her place at the upcoming European Championships in doubt. 

Tears: British long jump record-holder Shara Proctor pulled out of the Commonwealth final in tears

Despair: England's Proctor did not even register a jump before she pulled out with a suspected thigh injury

Pain: Proctor was visibly hurting and was also clearly upset as she pulled out at Hampden Park in Glasgow

'Shara Proctor sustained a quadricep muscle injury,' Team England said in a statement.

'She will be further assessed by Team England medical staff.'
