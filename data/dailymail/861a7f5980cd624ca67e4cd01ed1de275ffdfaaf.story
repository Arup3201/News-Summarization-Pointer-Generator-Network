A British holidaymaker has died in Ibiza - the second casualty of partying on the Balearic Islands in less than a week.

Christopher Briggs, 25, was found dead by a friend after an alcohol-fuelled night out in the notorious party resort of San Antonio.

He is believed to have fallen and hit his head after returning to his hotel room alone.

Mr Briggs was staying with a group of friends in two rooms at the two-star Apolo Hotel.

Police were called to the hotel on Sunday morning when one of his roommates returned from a night out and found him lying on the floor next to his bed.

A post-mortem was due to take place this morning.

One friend told local Civil Guard officers that he became separated from Mr Briggs while partying - he admitted they were drinking heavily but insisted they did not take drugs.

A source close to the investigation said: 'There were no signs of violence on his body apart from a head injury which it is thought he suffered during a fall.

'The post-mortem will obviously determine the cause of death but everything at this stage is pointing to it being the result of a tragic accident.'

Last Thursday aspiring model and musician Thomas Ousby, 19, plunged to his death from the ninth-floor of a hotel in Magaluf on the neighbouring island of Majorca.

Mr Ousby, from Uxbridge in West London, had jetted out to the resort in early June and was selling tickets for bar crawls and boat parties.

His last tweet on the day he died read: 'Magas all good. Coming home sometime this week though, me thinks.'

He is said to have ignored a maintenance man who spotted him climbing an external fire escape and told him to get down.

Last month father-of-three Craig Knapp, 31, from Dundee, killed himself by jumping to his death from a 10th balcony in Magaluf after leaving a suicide note on Facebook.

A day earlier Janine Mallett, 31, from Stockton-on-Tees near Middlesborough was found floating dead in the sea off San Antonio after becoming separated from a friend during a night out.
