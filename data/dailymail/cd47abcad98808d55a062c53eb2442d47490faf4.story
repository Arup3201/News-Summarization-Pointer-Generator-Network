Englishman Chris Wood shot the lowest round of the week at the
Open so far with a seven under par score of 65.

Wood finished with a score of five under overall
having started the day at two over after a mixed tournament.

Good day's work: Wood (right) shakes hands with his caddie after the finishing the best round of the week

Looking good: It was a superb display from the 26-year-old who made at least par on every hole

He birdied each of the last four holes, as well as the fourth, eighth and tenth, and didn't drop a single shot in a flawless final round.

Wood has a good record at the Open, having finished fifth in 2008 when he was an amateur, and then tieing for third the next year.

The 6ft 5in Englishman was never in contention this year, however, after shooting a three over par 75 on day one. He recovered with a second round 70, but a 73 on Saturday halted his charge.

Getting into the swing: The Bristolian had a disappointing first three days at a competition he loves

He can nonetheless take pride in an excellent round which lifted him up the leaderboard into the top 30.
