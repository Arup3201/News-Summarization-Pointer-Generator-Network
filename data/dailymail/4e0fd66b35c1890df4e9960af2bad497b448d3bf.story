Brazilian club Gremio says it has indefinitely suspended one of its fan groups after some members taunted an opposition player with racial insults.

The club says the 'Geral do Gremio' fan group is banned from its stadium and prohibited from using any of the team logos.

The decision comes less than a week after fans called Santos goalkeeper Aranha a 'monkey' in a Brazilian Cup match at Arena Gremio. Some also imitated monkey noises toward the goalie.

Punishment: Gremio has indefinitely suspended one of its fan groups after tehe incident

Gremio is facing a harsh suspension and even exclusion from the Brazilian Cup because of the fans' actions. A sports tribunal is expected to rule on the case this week.

The club had already banned five fans caught on cameras insulting Aranha. Some of them will be interrogated by police.
