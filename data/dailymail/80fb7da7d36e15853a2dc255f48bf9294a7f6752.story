Marco Reus turned down a lucrative move to Manchester United this summer, according to Atletico Madrid president Enrique Cerezo.

The La Liga champions have been linked with a move for the Borussia Dortmund forward but Cerezo claims that the 25-year-old was never an option - while revealing United's own failure to land the highly-rated German.

‘I don’t know where the Marco Reus rumour came from. It’s a player who, at this time, is impossible to us,’ he said.

Snubbed: Marco Reus turned down a big money move to Old Trafford, according to Atletico Madrid chief

Most wanted: The Borussia Dortmund forward has been linked with numerous European clubs

‘Look, he had an offer for a lot of money from Manchester United and he has not gone… we will not sign him with a lesser offer.’

Louis van Gaal has endured a frustrating summer in the transfer market with Ander Herrera and Luke Shaw the only significant arrivals as the former Premier League champions attempt to rebuild their squad.

United have agreed a £16million fee with Sporting Lisbon for defender Marcos Rojo, while they remain interested in the likes of Daley Blind and Real Madrid winger Angel Di Maria - but it seems they have missed the chance to sign Reus.

The Germany international, who missed the World Cup through a last minute injury, has been attracting interest from several of Europe's elite clubs after it was revealed his contract carried a £19.8 million release clause that comes in to effect next summer.

No deal! Louis van Gaal has been frustrated in the transfer market since arriving at United

Reus rejoined Dortmund in 2012 from Borussia Monchengladbach after his hometown club released him as a 17-year-old and scored 21 goals in 39 matches last season.

One club he won't be joining is Bundesliga rivals Bayern Munich - who have signed Mario Gotze and Robert Lewandowski from Dortmund in the last two years - after coach Pep Guardiola admitted he was not interested.

'We already have eight strikers. I do not need new players. I am pleased with this squad,' said Guardiola.
