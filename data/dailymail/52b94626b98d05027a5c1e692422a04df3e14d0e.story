Two brothers have become fathers within 82 minutes of each other - at the same hospital.

Nick Pereira sent his brother David a text to let him know that his wife Beth was in labour at a New York Hospital on Wednesday - only to discover that his brother was already there.

Despite due dates more than a week apart, both their wives had gone into labour at the same time.

One big family: Nick Pereria is holding his son Nathaniel who was delivered 82 minutes before his brother David's firstborn Gwyneth

Cousins Nathaniel and Gwyneth were delivered less than an hour-and-a-half apart at Winthrop University Hospital on Long Island on Wednesday.

Despite being just one day old, the cousins have already met and the two young families are just two doors from each other at the hospital.

Both babies were born early, Nick's son Nathaniel was nine days early and David's firstborn Gwyneth came one day before her due date.

Although the brothers say they always knew their children would have a special bond, they had not expected it to be quite this special.

‘We talked about how amazing this is,
that it actually happened on the same day and the whole procedure of 
the wives’ giving birth,’ Nick Pereira told ABC News.

Amazed: Nick could not believe the brother he shares everything with became a father on the same day as his second child was born

Tight-knit: The Pereria brothers and their wives hope their children will share more than just a birthday and become as close as siblings

‘I hope there will be a special bond, the way our families are, we are always together.

'Growing up and being together and sharing a birthday will help them have a closer bond than a sibling that’s three or four years apart,’ he added.

The Pereria brothers say they do everything together and that this has brought their families closed than ever.

‘It’s almost the bond with twins, you can feel it without having to say it. How we do everything together, we are so close, we are very fortunate and that’s what I think the cousins will have too,’ Pereira said.
