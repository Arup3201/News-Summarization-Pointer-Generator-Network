Tony Blair speaking at Bloomberg in London yesterday: The former PM's role in the delay of the Chilcot Inquiry into the Iraq War has been questioned

A long-delayed report on the Iraq war is unlikely to see the light of day until after the next general  election, according to well-placed sources.

Despite growing anger over the wait for publication of Sir John Chilcot’s investigation into the 2003 conflict, it is now not expected to be ready until early next year.

Whitehall sources suggest that with an election due in May 2015, it will be deemed too politically difficult to publish it until after voters have gone to the polls.

Labour strategists are said to be alarmed at the prospect of voters being reminded of the Iraq war in the months before the election, since the conflict was blamed for driving many of its voters to the Liberal Democrats in 2005 and 2010.

Lord Morris, a former Labour Attorney General, yesterday called for ‘clarification’ on whether Tony Blair, Gordon Brown or the Cabinet Office were involved in the delay.

He insisted Mr Blair must not be allowed to stymie the release of the report – a charge the former prime minister firmly denied.

Sir John, who was asked to investigate the Iraq war by Mr Brown in 2009, last took evidence from a witness three years ago.

He warned David Cameron in November that it was ‘regrettable’ that a deal could not be agreed on the disclosure of communications between Mr Blair and George W Bush, the US President at the time of the Iraq war. The Prime Minister said he hoped the issues would be ‘concluded as soon as possible’.

But there is speculation in Whitehall that the process of declassifying documents, including Mr Blair’s correspondence with President Bush before the war, remains stalled.

It is thought that no one involved has so far received a letter from the inquiry as part of the so-called  ‘Maxwellisation’ process – the legal requirement to notify individuals who are criticised in a government-commissioned report.

One source said: ‘It’s certainly not going to be ready before the end of the year and it would be a highly political act to publish in the months before an election. The can is going to be kicked further down the road.’

Lord Morris asked: ‘Who is responsible for the delay? Not Chilcot and his colleagues, who must be anxious to publish. Two past prime ministers – Gordon Brown and Tony Blair?

‘A Cabinet Office fighting to maintain a precedent that Cabinet minutes and discussions between the two previous prime ministers should be permanently kept private?

‘Parliament deserves a clear statement from Mr Cameron as to the reasons for the delays. What urgently needs clarification now is where the main hold-up is.’

Mr Blair has insisted that ‘going back over Chilcot’ is not going to get Britain and its allies out of difficult decisions over intervening in other troubled Middle East states.

Labour MP Paul Flynn, who rebelled over Iraq, claimed Mr Blair ‘dreads the publication of Chilcot’.

‘The vote on the Iraq war was the foulest episode of the Blair government,’ he said. ‘The 139 Labour MPs who voted on a severe three-line whip against British involvement were not enough. There were 80 other Labour MPs who had indicated their worries by their support for amendments and early day motions.

‘They were bribed, bullied and bamboozled into voting for war, or abstaining. I wonder if Tony and the whips ever dwell on the thought that 179 British lives would not have been lost if they had told the truth and desisted from bellicose bullying.’
