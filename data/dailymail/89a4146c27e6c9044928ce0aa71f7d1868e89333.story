Days after violent anti-capitalist protests in Brussels and London, the first demonstrations against next week's G20 summit in Brisbane took on a more relaxed atmosphere.

About 100 anti-poverty activists turned out dressed as accountants and reclined on beach chairs alongside Brisbane River on Saturday.

It comes as security is ramped up in preparation for the summit, with nearly 7000 police and soldiers being flown to the city, and large areas being declared a secure zone.

On Thursday, an anti-establishment protest in Brussels turned violent with cars being set ablaze and police  using tear gas to quell the 100,000 strong crowd.

About 50 people were hurt and 30 were detained at the initially peaceful demonstration.

In London, a separate anti-capitalist protest labelled the 'million man march' took place outside Parliament Square on Wednesday.

Violence erupted as thousands of masked protesters blocked off roads and attacked police. Officers were forced to draw their batons as missiles and road signs were launched into the sky, while protesters attacked cars and members of the public with yellow flexible tubes.

At one point, there were reports of protesters surrounding a man driving a new Mercedes car and spraying the back of the vehicle with an aerosol can, threatening him with their tubes as he opened his windows.

Though it was organised with similar motives, the Brisbane demonstration on Saturday was much more placid, with police confirming there were no arrests.

The protesters, part of the anti-poverty group Micah Challenge, set up a mock tropical 'tax haven' in the central city to highlight the issue of multinational tax dodging, which they claim robs $160 billion annually from developing countries.

Spokeswoman Angela Owen said the demonstration was peaceful and well received. 'A lot of people said they supported our message and others said it was a really creative demonstration,' she said.

Extreme security measures have been implemented across Brisbane in light of previous G20 protests leading to riots, as well as threats of violent action from local anarchist groups.

The Australian Defence Force have been conducting a series of counter-terrorism exercises in Brisbane in preparation for the event.

More than 900 soldiers will be based in Brisbane, with a further 1000 on call, as well as an immense police presence

There is now believed to be about 6000 police, including 1500 from interstate and New Zealand, who will patrol the area until  November 17.

These officers have been permitted to carry firearms, while international forces have yet to granted permission.

Meanwhile, a large swathe of central Brisbane was declared a security zone on Saturday, forming a security buffer around areas like hotels where delegates will stay, as well as the convention centre where the summit will take place.

Under the G20 (Safety and Security) Act, police will have the power to search people within the declared zone if they suspect them of having prohibited items, which include include obvious things like firearms, knives and explosives, however, they also include eggs, kites and glass jars, which are prohibited without a lawful excuse for possessing them.

Deputy Commissioner Ross Barnett has vowed that residents will only be punished if they break the rules.

'There's got to be a connection between the item and some intent to possibly disrupt the event or hurt some person,' he said.

'The item itself is not strictly the issue. It's the time, date and place that it's used and the intent of the person who has it.'

International leaders are also taking immense precautions with the G20 event, with news that Barrack Obama is planning on flying in at the ultra-secure Amberley air-base instead of Brisbane airport.

One man, 57, has been banned from the summit after taking photos without permission on the steps of the Brisbane convention centre. He is the fourth person to be banned from the event. 

At about 11:35, the man was arrested after refusing to give his details, before arguing and struggling with officers. 

Police also found homemade bombs and bomb-making equipment on Saturday at a residence in Rochedale South, 20 km from Brisbane, reports Courier Mail.

Officers arrived at the property at to find a number of explosives at 4pm, however they claim the bombs were not terrorism or G20 related.

The G20 is often been met with radical protests from anti-establishment groups.The 2010 Toronto summit protests saw $750,000 worth of damage wreaked on the streets, including scores of vehicles being set ablaze and mass looting of stores.
