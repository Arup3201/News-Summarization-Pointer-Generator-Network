Surfer extraordinaire Brandy the Pug has created quite a ripple both in and out of the ocean at Del Mar beach in San Diego with his admirable ability to ride big waves.

Brandy's unique surfing demonstration was recently orchestrated to promote a local fundraiser entitled  'Best Dog Surfing Competition in the World' fundraiser.

And a camera placed on the board caught the pooch in action as he crashed through the waves with his owner.  

In the video Brandy sits upright on the centre of the board and he seems unperturbed by the challenge of surfing.

Wearing a fur-tight neon buoyancy aid which matches the colour of his bright surfboard while one of the Pug's friends is on hand to guide him in the right direction.

Del Mar beach, which is affectionately called 'Dog Beach' by dog owners, boasts over one and a half miles of golden sand and an abundance of turquoise water. 

The canine is helping to raise awareness and funding for orphan pets at Helen Woodward Animal Centre by promoting a range of local events.

The resort is one of the most popular locations for surfing in San Diego and Brandy is a frequent visitor. 

In the video, which is set to a classic Beach Boys tune, the pug can be seen being set up to ride a wave by a human helper.

Then as he is left to surf the wave into shore, the mutt can be seen crouching low, close to the board, like a pro, as other surfers look on.

The dog seems unperturbed by the unusual hobby, even when the water comes crashing over the board.

And as he finishes his final ride, he is greeted as a hero by his doggy pals.
