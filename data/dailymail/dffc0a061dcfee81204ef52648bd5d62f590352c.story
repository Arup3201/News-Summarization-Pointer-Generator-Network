Alan Hutton slammed in what looked to be a strike derived of frustration as his goal put a stop to Aston Villa's pre-season blip as they beat League One Walsall.

Paul Lambert's side - watched by Ron Vlaar, who was there but not in the squad for the penultimate friendly ahead of the Premier League campaign - looked at ease throughout. 

In truth, Villa will face a much sterner test when they host Parma at the weekend, while Hutton is hoping for redemption after a nightmare two years.

Walsall: O'Donnell, Taylor, Downing, Bradshaw, Sawyers, Benning, J.Chambers,Clifford, Flanagan, Kinsella, Grimes. 

Subs: Holden, A.Chambers, Baxendale, Webber, Morris, Heath, Bakayoko, Henry, Rowley, Mantom, MacGillivray.

Aston Villa: Guzan, Hutton (Lowton 46), Okore (Stevens 46), Baker (Herd 66), Clark (Senderos 46), Richardson (N'Zogbia 46), El Ahmadi, Westwood, Delph, Weimann (Grealish 66), Agbonlahor. 

Subs: Given Bennett, Gardner, Bacuna.

Goal: Hutton 28 

The former Rangers man put the visitors in front after indifferent defending - Walsall allowing a routine ball to bobble across the box and the right wing-back to lash home with minimal fuss.

In a fixture that rather meandered along, the top flight outfit - operating in a 3-5-2 - always looked the brighter and created the better chances at the Banks's Stadium.

Ciaran Clark went close with an early header while Karim El Ahmadi curled wide soon after. 

Philippe Senderos nodded wide after the break when he ought to have done better while Fabian Delph sent two rasping drives over the top of Richard O'Donnell's bar.

This result comes as a timely boost for the boss, who has seen Villa lose heavily against Groningen and Chesterfield recently.
