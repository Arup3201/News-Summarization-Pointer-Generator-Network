Rio Ferdinand has only just joined QPR but he is already at the centre of a lively dressing room.

Harry Redknapp's side are out in Germany for their pre-season tour, and Ferdinand revealed on Twitter that he was rooming with former Old Trafford team-mate Danny Simpson.

The former Manchester United star posted on Twitter: 'Double training today for moi....rooming with @dannysimpson ! does a nice tea does our Danny! #RsInGermany'.

Never one to stay quiet, charismatic midfielder Joey Barton floated the idea that Simpson had been following his new team-mate around the camp in awe on Twitter.

Best pals: Rio Ferdinand and Danny Simpson together on QPR's pre-season tour of Germany

Banter: Barton continues to give Simpson plenty of stick on Twitter for following Ferdinand around

This culminated in him posting a picture of the two together with the message: 'Getting ridiculous @dannysimpson let him have his dinner. Yes, he can remember you from United... @rioferdy5.'

The banter between the trio continued to flow with Simpson striking back responding to Barton: 'Someone's got their Alice band on. Only reason you can see your phone lad lol.

This kind of banter within the R's squad will please the fans especially, after a troublesome couple of years before promotion last term.

Fight back: The QPR defender gave as good as he got during the banter on Twitter

Team spirit was a huge problem within the squad when they were relegated from the Premier League two years ago, but thankfully those days look a far cry away now.

QPR kick off their tour schedule with a friendly against third-tier side Rot Weiss Erfut on Tuesday night.

One player not on the tour is Adel Taarabt, who spent the second half of last season on loan at AC Milan.

Despite impressing in Italy it looks increasingly likely Taarabt will have to either look for a move elsewhere or be forced to stay put, with Milan choosing not to make a bid for him this summer.

Loic Remy was also not been named in Redknapp's squad for the pre-season tour as he edges ever closer to a move to Liverpool.

Former West Ham midfielder Jack Collison did make the cut though after impressing the former Tottenham manager in training.
