Burglar Christopher Harrison was jailed for six years after targeting the homes of the elderly. He has more than 160 burglaries on his record

Britain's most prolific house burglar who targeted vulnerable elderly people by un-pegging their washing before he sneaked into their homes has been jailed for six years.

One man crime-wave Christopher Harrison, 30, has a record of 160 burglaries and 70 attempted burglaries over a 17-year career.

After early release from a four-and-a half-year prison sentence for 143 burglaries, Wilson toured East Yorkshire from Mappleton to Howden from January 13 to April 3 this year looking for pensioner's homes.

Harrison burgled ten homes in East Yorkshire and ten in Hull. He has targeted 200 homes in his career- and dozens of cars. He was stealing to feed his heroin habit and has been breaking into people homes since he was 13.

Harrison's favourite distraction method was to un-peg washing. When women went out to pin it back on the line, Harrison would sneak-in and grab their hand bags.

Edna Pollock, 87, lives alone in a semi-detached pensioner's bungalow in Clarondale, Hull. On February 1 this year she found her washing laid out on the grass in her back garden.

While she went out to pin it back up Harrison went in her bedroom and stole her bank card. She had so little faith in the police she did not even report it.

In a victim impact statement, she said: 'I feel very frail and I cannot sleep. I have been unwell and this incident has made me worse.

'At night, I'm kept awake by any noise and am terrified someone is in my home. I live alone and since this burglary it has made me a lot less confident.

'The fact an intruder has been in my house disgusts me. I do not feel safe and I should not feel this way in my own home.'

Morris Nicholson, 78, from Hull, was burgled by Harrison as he pruned his roses in the garden. Harrison was seen to crouch down in a neighbour's bush waiting for Mr Nicholson to turn his back.

Harrison ran in the house and stole a door key. A neighbour called the police and Harrison was caught nearby.

Mr Nicholson said: 'Due to what happened I now feel more vulnerable and nervous in my own home. I feel he will come back.'

Jailing Harrison yesterday, Judge Mark 
Bury said: 'You have a horrid record for house burglary. Between 1996 
and 2011 you appeared before the courts for 16 house burglaries, but 
have a schedule of 144 further offences to be taken into consideration.

'You seem to target elderly people, judging by the names of your victims. There are not many young people called Marjorie, Dorothy and Joan.

'You have now admitted two further burglaries and admitted 33 further burglaries on a schedule and seven offences of theft. There comes a point under Operation Clean Slate when you must be sentenced for what you have done. You are a career house burglar.'

'You have a horrid record for house burglary.'

Judge Mark 
Bury

Crown barrister Jane Bryan told Hull Crown Court Harrison's crime spree included Mona Nightingale's home in Full Sutton on January 29 where he sneaked in and stole a handbag one of 10 burglaries in the East Riding. There were four schedules of offences including shop thefts.

Harrison, of Hull, appeared at Hull Crown Court for sentence after pleading guilty to two burglaries and asking for 33 burglaries and seven thefts to be taken into consideration.

The court heard he was jailed for four and a half years in 2011 for a house burglary asking for 144 offences to be taken into consideration - 127 of which were burglaries and 70 attempted burglaries.

In 2011 he took advantage of Humberside Police's Operation Clean Slate - to boost their clear up figures for crime and gain a one third reduction on sentence.

He broke into cars as well as homes. Harrison made use of Operation Clean Slate and the early guilty plea scheme in April this year for a further discount to escape more jail time.

Defence barrister Richard Thompson said: 'He took advantage of Operation Clean Slate last time. He has not mended his ways. Some of these offences go back to 2004. He has a drug habit.

'He has shown remorse. Unfortunately at the time of these offences, he was not able to prioritise his victim's interests above his own.'

Judge Bury said he was obliged to give him a one third discount, but added if he had fought a trial he would have jailed him for nine years. Harrison was jailed for six years.
