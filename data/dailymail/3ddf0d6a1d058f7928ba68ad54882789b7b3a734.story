Another Samsung teaser not only hints at the imminent arrival of the Galaxy S5 smartphone, it suggests the phone's interface may also be getting an overhaul.

The teaser was unveiled on the Korean tech giant's official blog and shows nine rounded app icons - current icons are a mixture of shapes.

These icons are also 'flatter' in design, similar to those seen on Apple's iOS 7 software, having previously been designed with shadowing to give them a 3D appearance.

Samsung unveiled the teaser invitation, pictured, on its official blog. It features rounded icons for Samsung apps, and hints towards a new-look version of its Touchwiz interface. Touch Wiz is a skinned version of Google's Android operating system. The icons also have the 'flatter' design seen in Apple's iOS 7

The handset is expected to be announced on February 24, and go on sale worldwide in April.

Rumours suggest it will have a 5.25inch QHD (2,560×1,440) Super AMOLED display.

It is expected to run the Exynos 6/Snapdragon 805 processor and feature a 16MP camera - up from 13MP on the Galaxy S4.

Any new Touchwiz interface will be laid on top of the latest version of Android 4.4, also known as KitKat.

The casing of the Galaxy S5 may also come in plastic, following suit from previous models of the phone, as well as metal to rival the iPhone 5S.

Samsung sent journalists invitations to a
 'Samsung Unpacked' event at the Mobile World Congress show in 
Barcelona, last month.

This latest invitation features details of the 
event's webcast.

The apps listed are Speed, Curiosity, Fun, Outdoor, Social, Style, Privacy, Fitness and Life.

These icons also appear to be colour coded, with apps relating to features of the phone -  Privacy, Speed, and Curiosity - shown in blue.

Outdoor, Style and Fitness are shown in green, while the Social icon is yellow, Fun is purple and Life is red.

This new look suggests the Touchwiz interface used across Samsung's devices will be redesigned for the S5 - or whichever device the firm announces.

Touchwiz is a skinned version of Google Android, designed specifically for Samsung gadgets.

It makes it stand out from the traditional Android used on Nexus devices, for example.

The icons on the teaser also hint at what Samsung wants to promote as the phone's main features, namely speed and privacy. Meanwhile, Curiosity could hint towards a new search feature.

Samsung sent journalists invititations to a 'Samsung Unpacked' event, pictured, at the Mobile World Congress show in Barcelona, last month. This latest invititation features details of the event's webcast. The Korean firm is expected to use the event to reveal its Galaxy S5 alongside a new, curved version of its Galaxy Gear watch

It's not surprising Samsung may be looking to improve its Touchwiz interface.

Last November, vice chairman Kwon Oh-hyun admitted that the software is poor, and that the firm is better at designing hardware than developing software.

The Korean firm is expected to use the event to reveal its Galaxy S5 alongside a new, curved version of its Galaxy Gear watch.

The numerous references to the number five throughout the latest teaser add weight to these claims.

It has already been claimed the handset could have a new 'smart' home screen that changes depending on the user's location, or what they are doing.

Leaks of Samsung's new menu system show a series of 'smart cards' showing information to users than can change depending on where they are or what they are doing. This is similar to how Google Now works

An image obtained by website @evleaks,
 shows a home screen displaying a series of cards, similar to how Google
 Now works; showing nearby locations as well as information gleaned from
 apps about what the user is doing.

For
 example, it shows details of the user's latest run, a flight they plan to 
catch and text messages from friends. This could be a major overhaul for Samsung's flagship handset, if it is legitimate.

The specs for Samsung's new Galaxy S5 
have also already leaked online, amid claims the handset will come in both 
metal and plastic versions.

The
 handset is expected to have a 5.25-inch screen - up from the S4's 5-inch display - use iris 
scanning to recognise users without a password, and will run a 
superfast Snapdragon processor.

There is also expected to be a mini version of the S5, and a camera version called the Zoom, according to the Sammobile web site.

The metal version is expected to cost around 800 Euros (£657) and the
 plastic model is rumoured to cost around 650 Euros (£535).

By comparison, the metal Phone 5S starts at £549.

If true, Samsung's move is identical to Apple's decision to launch a plastic iPhone 5C alongside its flagship 5S model last year.
