Leicester City winger Anthony Knockaert is discussing a potential Bosman move to Standard Liege.

The Frenchman, who is out of contract at the end of the season, is free to talk to overseas clubs and has been to Liege to check out the facilities and discuss personal terms.

Knockaert, 23, has made only five starts for Leicester this season and has not featured since the FA Cup win at Tottenham Hotspur in January, when he was an unused substitute.

Knockaert is one of ten first team players out of contract at Leicester as well as Esteban Cambiasso, Matt Upson, Paul Konchesky, Gary Taylor-Fletcher, Dean Hammond, Marcin Wasilewski, Conrad Logan, Paul Gallagher and Zoumana Bakayogo.

Meanwhile, the Foxes have rejected approaches for striker Tom Lawrence from an astonishing nine clubs.

The former Manchester United forward has barely played for Leicester since arriving from Old Trafford in the summer but manager Nigel Pearson wants to have all options available as he battles against the odds to keep Leicester in the Premier League.
