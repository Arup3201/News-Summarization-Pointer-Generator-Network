Not satisfied with simply beating up a 16-year-old for his cell phone Tuesday, a group of robbers then used the stolen device to text 'I'm gay' to the victim's mother.

Seattle police said the unidentified victim was waiting for his bus on Southwest Barton Street at about 4 p.m. when he was suddenly assaulted.

KATU reports that the teen dropped his phone and backpack trying to defend himself.

The group of attackers left with those items when someone yelled at them to stop the fight.

The battered victim returned home to his mother who had gotten a text from his missing phone reading: 'I'm gay you know that.'

The victim told authorities one attacker was a former classmate, but he was unable to identify the rest of the gang.

Besides a cut on his face and a hurt tooth, he was uninjured.  

It could have been worse. In one case in September a stolen cell phone was used to rack up more than $500,000 in charges on one Australian man's account.

Yahoo Finance reports that the cellphone carrier waived those charges after some argument from the victim. 

Cell phone theft has become so prevalent and potentially hurtful that The New York Daily News reported that New York State Attorney General Eric Scheiderman met with reps from Apple, Google, Motorola, Samsung, and Microsoft in 2013 to ask them to make it easier for victims to make their phones inoperable if stolen.

Earlier this month, Apple unveiled an iCloud tool to check and see if your phone was stolen.
