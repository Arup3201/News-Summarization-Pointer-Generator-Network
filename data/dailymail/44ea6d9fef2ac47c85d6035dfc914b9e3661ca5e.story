You approach your front door and the lock slides open at a prompt from your phone.

Once inside your kitchen the coffee maker springs into action and the oven is flashing up a recipe for the evening meal.

It knows what food you have because it has just been talking – by wifi – to the equally ‘smart’ fridge.

Tech firms, including giants like Samsung and LG, are pushing revolutionary smart appliances that can be controlled via a wi-fi radio link to a home technology hub and the internet

Samsung is hoping to speed the take up of IoT and the smart home by investing more than $100million this year in devising how these devices will make life easier

This vision of the future may seem far off but, according to Samsung, it is only two years away.

The electronics giant says that, by then, nine out of ten household appliances it makes will be internet- enabled and controlled by mobiles, tablets and voice commands.

The entire industry will fall into line with this ‘Internet of Things’ within five years, according to Boo-Keun Yoon, the South Korean company’s president.

He told the Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas yesterday that tech firms had to explain how their devices would free people from chores – allowing them to spend more time with family, pursue more hobbies and, in his case, spend ‘time on the putting green’.

The South Korean tech giant used CES to announce its next-generation flexible phone, called G Flex 2.

It has a Qualcomm Snapdragon 810 64-bit octa-core processor, with 2GB of RAM.

The 5.5-inch full HD curved display has a 1080 x 1920 pixel resolution and a 403 Pixel Per Inch density.

It runs Android Lollipop and the whole device is said to be 30 per cent more durable than the original model.   

It’s these great benefits that we need to explain,’ he added. ‘We can’t just talk about the Internet of Things because it’s so impersonal, like a bedtime story for robots. We have to show what’s in it for people.

‘It’s not science fiction. It’s science fact. Internet of Things has the potential to transform our economy, society, and how we live our lives.’

Samsung is hoping to speed the take-up of Internet of Things and the smart home with the investment of more than £66million this year.

It has bought SmartThings, the makers of a hub device that connects up appliances and allows them to be controlled remotely. Crucially, the hub will work with products made by other manufacturers.

Samsung’s rivals have also been announcing the roll-out of smart devices that can be controlled via a home hub and the web.

LG has unveiled smart washing machines, fridges and ovens that can be operated remotely.

Sony is developing Life Space UX – lights, speakers and projectors that are controlled by a smartphone. And Google has brought out its own home hub, called Nest.

Samsung is not alone in pushing IoT, for both LG and Sony have also been announcing the roll-out of smart devices that can be controlled via a home hub and the web

LG showcased its latest 'Door-In-Door' fridge. Shelves are built into the first set of doors, which then open around a second set of doors, and the main fridge compartment. LG claims it stops up to 47 per cent of cold air escaping each time the fridge is opened, which saves energy and keeps food fresher for longer
