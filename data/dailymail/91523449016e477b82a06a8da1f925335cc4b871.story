Later this year, SpaceX plans to perform the first test flight of its heavy-lift rocket, known as the Falcon Heavy, with a view to one day taking astronauts to the moon or Mars.

And exactly how the rocket will take flight and return to Earth has been detailed in a new promotional video.

It shows the huge rocket, which will be the most powerful currently in operation, lifting into orbit before its various boosters autonomously land back at the launch pad.

SpaceX have revealed how their Falcon Heavy rocket will work. A video shows it lifting off (shown) from a launch pad in Florida. Its side boosters and core then land themselves back at the pad. SpaceX say reusability is key to keeping launch costs down. The Falcon Heavy will be used to take astronauts to the moon and Mars

The video shows how the Falcon Heavy rocket will take off with four million pounds (1.8 million kg) of thrust from Launch Complex 39A at Nasa’s Kennedy Space Centre in Florida.

‘Thrust at liftoff is equal to approximately eighteen 747 aircraft operating simultaneously,’ according to SpaceX.

The goal of the rocket is to provide a means of lifting large amounts of cargo into space at a relatively low cost.

It is estimated that each flight of the rocket will eventually cost about £56 million ($85 million).

Height: 224.4ft (68.4 metres)

Weight: 3.23 million lbs (1.46 million kg)

Total width: 38ft (11.6 metres)

Thrust at liftoff: 4 million lbs (1.8 million kg)

Engines: 27 Merlin 1D engines

Lifting capability to low Earth orbit: 117,000lbs (53,000kg)

Lifting capability to geostationary orbit: 47,000lbs (21,200kg)

Lifting capability to Mars: 29,000lbs (13,200kg)

Expected first launch: Mid-2015 

For comparison, Nasa's comparable Space Launch System, which admittedly is more powerful, will cost about £330 million ($500 million) per launch. 

To do this, SpaceX plans to return most of the rocket back to the launchpad, enabling its boosters to be used on multiple flights. 

The rocket is designed with a central core booster that is derived from the smaller Falcon 9 rocket - which has already completed many successful flights.

Strapped to either side are two additional  Falcon 9 rocket cores. 

Once they have exhausted most of their fuel, the two side boosters are released.

The video shows how they will then spin around in Earth’s atmosphere and descend in a controlled manner back to Earth.

As they descend, landing legs are deployed - and the two boosters land back at the launch pad from where they took off.

There’s a bit of artistic licence in the video, though, as it’s unlikely the boosters would land at the same time - instead touching down probably around 30 seconds apart.

Nasa’s Space Launch System (Block II)

Lifting capability: 290,000lbs (130,000kg)

Falcon Heavy

117,000lbs (53,000kg)

Space Shuttle

53,790lbs (24,000kg)

Delta IV Heavy

49,740lbs (22,560kg)

Ariane 5

44,090lbs (20,000kg)

Atlas V

40,810lbs (18,510kg)

The video does highlight, though, how SpaceX will attempt to return their rockets to land - rather than a floating barge, as they recently attempted.

Later in the video, the central core of the rocket is then also brought back to Earth, landing near to the other two boosters.

Again, there’s some artistic licence - CEO Elon Musk has previously stated it will be difficult to land the core back on the ground, and instead it will most likely land on a barge in the ocean. 

To get humans to the moon or Mars, a huge rocket is needed to lift a large enough space containing the crew, spacecraft and cargo.

In the days of Apollo this was the Saturn V - but now SpaceX are working on this new breed of rocket that they say can do comparable missions much more cheaply.

It is being developed alongside Nasa’s Space Launch System,  which will be more powerful - but also much more expensive to fly.

SpaceX say their Falcon Heavy rocket will be able to carry twice the cargo of the world’s most powerful rocket currently in operation, the Delta IV Heavy.

It will be able to take more than 117,000lbs (53,000kg) to orbit - equivalent to a 737 jet loaded with passengers, crew, luggage and fuel.

For comparison, the Falcon 9 can take about 28,700lbs (13,000kg) to orbit - which is roughly the same payload that the Falcon Heavy will be capable of taking to Mars.  

In the video the two boosters land back at the launch pad (shown) after detaching from the main rocket. SpaceX ultimately wants to make almost all of their rockets reusable in order to bring the costs of launching down. It is estimated each launch of the Falcon Heavy will cost about £56 million ($85 million)

The Falcon Heavy is being developed alongside Nasa's Space Launch System (SLS) rocket, illustration shown, which is expected to complete its first unmanned flight in 2019. It will be considerably more powerful than the Falcon Heavy - but is also much more expensive to fly

This image from an environmental study by SpaceX shows where they intend to land the various components of their Falcon Heavy rocket at Launch Pad 39A in Florida. The contingency pads are for the side boosters, while the main landing pad would be for the central core - as seen in the video

Later this year, Elon Musk is set to reveal the details of SpaceX's secretive Mars Colonial Transporter - the vehicle that could take humans to Mars.

It's likely that their mission to the red planet will require multiple launches of the Falcon Heavy.

While the power of the rocket is impressive in itself, it is the reusability aspect which will prove to be one of its most desirable features.

Earlier this month, SpaceX attempted to land part of one of its smaller Falcon 9 rockets on a floating drone ship.

While the attempt dramatically failed, with the rocket exploding as it descended too quickly, SpaceX had always said the first attempt would be risky.

Through failure, they will be able to further refine the process - and ultimately begin bringing rockets safely back to the ground after launching.

And many will be watching in anticipation when the Falcon Heavy makes its first flight towards the middle of this year
