The U.S. Marine who pulled down a giant statue of Saddam Hussein in one of the most iconic moments of the Iraq war has spoken of his doubts about the controversial conflict.

Edward Chin's face was seen around the world after he climbed up onto the dictator's image in Baghdad and brought it crashing to the ground.

But now he asks what the U.S. was doing in the Middle East in the first place - and blames the West for abandoning the country to 'radicals and insurgents' in the aftermath of the invasion.

Destruction: The noose was attached to a tank which dragged the 40ft statue to the ground

Mr Chin, 34, signed up to the Marines in 1999 hoping to earn money for college.

The U.S. declared war on Saddam's dictatorial regime in March 2003 - 10 years ago last week - and quickly overwhelmed his under-powered troops.

On April 9, 2003, Mr Chin was part of a troop of Marines who arrived in Baghdad's Firdos Square, which was dominated by a 40ft statue of the long-serving leader.

He climbed up onto the statue and tied a noose around its neck which was then attached to a powerful M88 tank, which brought the icon down to cheers from the Iraqi bystanders, who then hit the statues with their shoes as a sign of disrespect.

However, 10 years later Mr Chin is not sure that there was any reason for him to be in Iraq at all, asking: 'What did we go there for?'

He told the Daily News: 'As Marines, we just do our jobs. We go where we are told. We hope that our leaders make the right decisions.'

The Marine from Brooklyn in New York says it was no surprise when Saddam's much-heralded weapons of mass destruction turned out not to exist.

'We weren't really looking for them,' he claimed - even though WMDs were supposed to be the justification for the war, which claimed the lives of nearly 4,500 U.S. troops and 179 British fighters.

Mr Chin spreads the blame for the apparent failure of the West's mission in Iraq evenly between the U.S. leadership and the Iraqi people themselves.

'I feel they really don't know what they want,' he told the Daily News. 'They didn't want Saddam in power. But they don't seem to want democracy either.'

The former Marine criticised the West for presiding over a brutal civil war stoked up by Iran, saying: 'We let it fall back into the hands of the radicals and insurgents.'

In the decade since the invasion, the country has been plagued by a conflict between the majority Shi'ites - backed by Iran's theocratic government - and the Sunnis who dominated Iraq during Saddam's time despite being in the minority.

Since leaving the military, Mr Chin has worked hard to rebuild his life - despite becoming embroiled in a divorce, he found love again and is now engaged.

He is working as an architect - and one commission in particular reminded him of his old life, and of how lucky he was to leave Iraq unhurt.

Poignantly, Mr Chin was part of a team which designed a new home for Brendan Marrocco, a soldier from New York who lost his arms and legs while serving in the country.
