The Archbishop of Canterbury has turned down an invitation to be a patron of the RSPCA.

The Most Rev Justin Welby declined the invitation from the animal charity as he has 'reluctantly decided to restrict his patronage', a spokesman for Lambeth Palace said.

Dr Welby's predecessors Rowan Williams, George Carey, Robert Runcle and Donald Coggan all accepted honorary positions within the charity which was founded in 1824 by an Anglican Priest.

Though he has 'great admiration' for the RSPCA, the Archbishop has 'reluctantly decided to restrict his patronage' a spokesman said

Lambeth Palace said: 'Since taking office in March this year, the Archbishop has received many kind invitations to patron a large variety of charities and good causes.

'Each invitation has been an honour, and in an ideal world he would like to accept them all.

'However, in light of the sheer volume of
 the requests the Archbishop receives, and the many pressures on his 
time and resources, he has reluctantly decided to restrict his patronage
 to a manageable number of organisations based on where he feels his 
support could be most beneficial.'

Breaking with tradition: Dr Welby's predecessors, including Rowan Williams (left) and George Carey (right), accepted the position at the top of the charity.

She added: 'The Archbishop has enormous admiration for the RSPCA and hopes to see its work thrive long into the future.'

Last year the animal charity came under scrutiny after spending £326,000 on legal action against a fox hunt.

Critics claimed the 'staggering' expense of bringing prosecution against the Heythrop Hunt in the Cotswolds was a waste of money donated by members of the public.

The Archbishop's refusal of the position is his most recent break with tradition, with four of his predecessors having assumed the role in the past. 

Since taking office in March this year, the he has made bureaucratic changes at Lambeth Palace and spoken out against the Church of England's association with money making organisations such as the payday loan company, Wonga.
