Tottenham Hotspur and Liverpool have been told to forget signing Saido Berahino this January.

West Bromwich Albion chairman Jeremy Peace has issued a statement insisting the striker will remain at the club until at least next summer and contract talks with Berahino's representatives have begun, with the focus on improving a deal which currently runs to 2017.

It is believed the 21-year-old will be offered double his current £12,000 per week salary, which was only signed last December. Before that he earned £850 per week.

It would mean that in the space of a year Berahino's wages will have increased by 2,723 per cent.

Spurs and Liverpool are monitoring Berahino, who is the top scoring Englishman in the Premier League with seven goals.

He is expected to win his first senior England cap during the upcoming internationals having been called up by Roy Hodgson.

Peace issued a hands-off warning to would-be suitors. ‘I wish to assure our supporters that Saido Berahino will not be going anywhere in January or, I hope, next summer,’ he said. 

‘It is not in our minds at all to trade a footballer the club has worked so diligently to develop.

Berahino's current deal is £12,000-a-week at The Hawthorns, and we was recently called up for England

'He is contracted to play for West Bromwich Albion until at least the summer of 2017 and we are happy to sit down with him and discuss extending that commitment on terms which recognise his continuing improvement as a footballer and his growing importance to our own plans.

'We have begun that process by opening preliminary talks with Saido's representatives.

'We are delighted that this development has now taken him all the way to the senior England squad. This reflects proudly on our club and the efforts of all the staff who have played such a key role in Saido's progress since he arrived here as an 11-year-old.

'However, it seems to have also generated unwarranted and excitable speculation about his future - which I wish to stress remains very firmly aligned to this football club.'

Berahino has scored seven Premier League goals this season and 10 goals in 13 games for England U21s
