Britons are to get first sight of tens of thousands of job vacancies after ministers demanded an end to adverts being placed across the EU.

Brussels rules used to mean that any jobs advertised on the government’s Universal Jobmatch had to be broadcast on an EU-wide website used by migrants looking for work.

But a deal struck between member states means that the jobs will now only be seen outside the UK if employers request it.

A deal struck by employment minister Esther McVey with other member states means that the jobs will now only be seen outside the UK if employers request it

The Universal Jobmatch website replaced the old system of jobcentres advertising vacancies on cards in their windows 

Universal Jobsearch was launched in November 2012, and more than 7million people have registered to use it.

More than 4million searches are carried out every day, with half a million vacancies on the site.

It replaced the old system of jobcentres advertising vacancies on cards in their windows.

However, EU rules meant that any of the adverts uploaded by 500,000 employers were replicated on an EU-wide jobs portal called ‘EURES’.

The British government called for changes to be made to ensure people already in the UK saw the vacancies first.

It comes as part of a crackdown on the ‘pull factors’ which attract EU migrants to Britain.

The deal was struck by Employment Minister Esther McVey during a meeting with her European counterparts in Brussels.

She told MailOnline: ‘We are giving businesses the choice of advertising their jobs only to British residents – it’s only right that they get that choice.

‘Under this Government, British nationals have accounted for two-thirds of the rise in employment. With new vacancies being created every single day, we want to make sure people here get the first chance to secure those jobs too.

‘The new rules will significantly reduce the number of jobs advertised in Europe and put British residents first – and we will continue work with countries across Europe to ensure the system remains fair to jobseekers and to businesses.’

Since the start of 2010, the number of British people in work has risen by 961,635, compared to a rise of 542,811 among EU nationals and an extra 456,503 people from the rest of the world

New figures released yesterday show that a record 30.8million people are in work in the UK.

Since the start of 2010, the number of British people in work has risen by 961,635, compared to a rise of 542,811 among EU nationals and an extra 456,503 people from the rest of the world.

Miss McVey added: ‘Behind these figures are individual stories of hard work and determination – stories of people turning their lives around, of families who are now feeling more secure over the Christmas period with a regular wage.

‘If we can tip the scale more in their direction it’s got to be a good thing.’

Miss McVey has held talks with Danish, Dutch, and Estonian employment ministers to secure further agreement on changes to the jobs market.

At the start of this year the government toughened the rules on foreign workers accessing jobs in the UK.

EU migrants are banned from claiming benefits for their first three months in the UK, and can only then receive Jobseeker’s Allowance for a maximum of three months.
