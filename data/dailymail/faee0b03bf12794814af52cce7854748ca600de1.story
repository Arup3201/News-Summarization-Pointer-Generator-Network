Nature photographer Don Johnston captured the fascinating play fight while visiting a grizzly bear sanctuary in the US state of Montana.

The 40st bears squared up to one another for a wrestling match in the snow, putting on a show for tourists.

Don, a retired biology teacher, was about 30ft away from the not-so cuddly bears as they bared their teeth and used judo-like moves to knock each other to the floor.

He was stood behind protective fencing while snapping the photos at the Montana Grizzly Encounter in the city of Bozeman.

The 62-year-old, from Lively, Ontario in Canada, said: ‘The power and strength of these animals was amazing to see, the ground shook when they rolled over.'

‘It was amazing to watch.’

Don, a self-taught photographer, has travelled the world to photograph wildlife – from giant polar bears and baby foxes to African elephants and raccoons.

On this occasion he visited bears at a sanctuary that rescues bears that were born in ‘inhumane captive situations’ and cannot be released into the wild.

On its website, the bear refuge says: ‘We give the bears the best possible life here at the sanctuary. We give people an opportunity to see and understand this awesome creature safely, up close, with no bars or cages to obstruct the view.’
