The tradition of the long soak is dwindling as people prefer speedy cleaning to relaxation

It used to be one of the most popular ways to unwind after a busy day.

But for millions the idea of slipping into a warm soothing bath is a thing of the past.

Now a quarter of Britons admit they have never had a bath, according to a survey.

Instead they are opting for a quick shower, often lasting just 30 seconds rather than a long soak in the tub, because of time constraints.

A survey of 1,000 people across Britain found on average 26 per cent of the population never run a bath.

In London and the south east, almost a third of people said that they do not splash around in a hot bath.

People in the west Midlands are more likely to spend time in the bath, with 80 per cent taking regular baths.

The figures appear to show that time for personal hygiene is at a premium, due to the modern pace of life.

Seventeen per cent of the population spend less than 30 seconds in the shower every morning.

Sharon Barclay from Homebase said: ‘An entire generation is missing out on a spectacular sensation which our grandparents took for granted. 

‘Even the Romans refused to forego the extraordinary pleasure of having a bath when they came to Britain in 55 BC. 

‘However, such is the pace of modern life, that a ritual which has lasted for centuries is in risk of falling out of favour in just two decades.

‘Being able to have a shower when you’re in a rush each morning is a tremendous advantage.

‘However, nothing beats being able to relax in a hot, foaming bath at the end of a long hard day.’

Young people aged between 18 and 24, were the generation most reluctant to have a bath.

The trend away from having a bath was spread evenly between men and women.

An average bath uses 80 litres of water but some power showers can use up to 136 litres in an eight-minute wash.

In sixteenth century Britain, many towns had public baths connected to the local bakery, using the heat from ovens to warm the water.

The shower is many Briton's preferred way to clean, with more than 70 per cent of people in the south east choosing it over the bath

East Anglia: 25.84 per cent

East Midlands: 28.57 per cent

London: 30.16 per cent

North East: 21.05 per cent

North West: 23.62 per cent

Northern Ireland : 34.48 per cent

Scotland: 24.72 per cent

South East : 33.56 per cent

South West: 25.56 per cent

Wales: 20 per cent

West Midlands: 19.98 per cent

Yorkshire and Humber: 24.69 per cent
