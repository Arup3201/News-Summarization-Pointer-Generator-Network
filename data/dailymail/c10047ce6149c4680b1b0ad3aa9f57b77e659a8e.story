A cellphone video shot by a bystander on August 8 shows Martin body-slamming, punching, dragging and throwing the puppy into the street, KTLA reported. 

The video shows Martin hurling racial slurs at the man recording the incident, 46-year-old Lindsey Cooks. It was turned over to the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department, which led to Martin's arrest.

At a preliminary court hearing last month, Cooks testified that he began recording Martin after he witnessed him cursing at the puppy while punching and kicking the puppy in the head, the Antelope Valley Times reported. 

Daisy was taken to the Los Angeles County Department of Animal Care and Control. The puppy was dragging one of its legs and walking with a limp, according to testimony at the hearing.  and appeared to have no injuries. 

The pit bull was later placed in foster care to recover and was later adopted by a person in San Juan Capistrano, the Valley Times said. 

'She is so sweet, she is now running, jumping playing, eating, drinking,' the unidentified new owner said. 'She doesn't cry in her sleep anymore and finally plays with her toys.'
