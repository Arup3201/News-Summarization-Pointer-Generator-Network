Manchester City are still waiting to complete the £32million signing of Porto defender Eliaquim Mangala despite footage leaking out of the player discussing his move.

It is understood that the video vault on City’s website was hacked, leading to the interview briefly appearing on the internet before being taken down.

However, it was filmed 12 days ago when Mangala travelled to Manchester for his medical and a tour of the club’s Carrington training facility before going on holiday.

Wait for it: Eliaquim Mangala's (L) £32million move to Manchester City has not been finalised

In the footage, the 23-year-old Frenchman is seen posing for pictures and giving an interview in which he says: ‘I am here to help the team to win titles – the league, the cup and the Champions League.’

City were waiting to post it on their website once the transfer is completed.

Although negotiations are said to be progressing well on what sources have described as a ‘complicated’ deal, it has not been finalised yet.

Mangala joined Porto in 2011 from Belgium club Standard Liege and has made 92 appearances in total.

He made his international debut last month in France's 1-0 friendly defeat to Uruguay and was part of Didier Deschamps' squad for the World Cup in Brazil although he did not feature.
