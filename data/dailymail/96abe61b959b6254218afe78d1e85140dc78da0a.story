Sepp Blatter will have the decisive say when FIFA’s executive committee vote on Friday on whether to publish the full Michael Garcia report into World Cup bid corruption.

Only six of the 25-strong committee can be guaranteed to vote yes — British vice-president Jim Boyce, Jordan’s Prince Ali, UEFA president Michel Platini, CONCACAF president Jeffrey Webb, Sunil Gulati of the USA and Germany’s Theo Zwanziger, who has put forward the motion calling for publication.

But such is FIFA president Blatter’s influence that his support for the motion would be enough to create a majority in favour.

Sepp Blatter said only older (pre 2010) members should be allowed to vote on the publication of the report

Garcia's (left) report was only published as a summary by FIFA, something Garcia himself quickly denounced 

Norther Ireland's Jim Boyce said FIFA's reputation is completely at stake ahead of vote

Northern Ireland’s Boyce said: ‘FIFA’s reputation is completely at stake here and the only way this is going to be enhanced is by hopefully the ExCo deciding that as much of the report as legally possible can be published.’

If they do so — following the bombshell resignation of Garcia, in which he effectively accused FIFA of mounting a cover-up of his findings — then some order can be restored to FIFA’s damaged house.

Failure to do so will lead to yet another outcry about a whitewash.
