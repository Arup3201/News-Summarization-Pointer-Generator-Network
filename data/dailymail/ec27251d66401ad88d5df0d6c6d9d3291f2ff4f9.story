They've already been shown to ease arthritic joints and be beneficial to the developing brains of children. 

Now research has shown that fish oils can also help smokers kick the habit. Fish oils contain omega-3 fatty acids. 

Current medical advice is to eat two portions of fish a week, including one portion of oily fish such as tuna or mackerel. Omega-3s are also found in leafy vegetables, wholewheat bread and walnuts. So what can they do for you – and is a supplement sometimes better? EVE McGOWAN spoke to the experts to find out…

A boost for brain power

THE CLAIM

Omega-3 supplements for children – the modern-day alternative to cod liver oil – help their developing brains.

THE PROOF

Numerous trials have shown that they can improve the behaviour and learning of children with ADHD and learning disabilities. More recently, Dr Alex Richardson, at Oxford’s Centre for Evidence-Based Intervention, studied underperforming children aged seven to nine. After taking daily supplements for 16 weeks, their behaviour and reading improved.

SUPPLEMENT OR DIET?

Dr Richardson says: ‘Almost all the children failed to eat enough fish so supplements are a reasonable option.’

Preventing a heart attack

THE CLAIM

Fish oils can do everything from lowering cholesterol to improving blood pressure and are an essential for heart health among at-risk groups.

THE PROOF

Omega-3s are known to reduce the inflammation of the arteries which can lead to heart attacks, as well as being an anticoagulant that can improve blood flow. ‘There is also evidence that they can help in normalising irregular heart rhythms,’ says Tom Sanders, professor of nutrition and dietetics at King’s College, London.

SUPPLEMENT OR DIET?

Supplements are prescribed on the NHS to prevent heart-attack survivors from having a second attack, as recommended by the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence.

A study published in the journal Neurology earlier this year found that a diet rich in omega-3s can increase volume of the part of the brain responsible for memory and protect against dementia

Improving your memory

THE CLAIM

Omega-3s have been hailed as a cure-all for brain health, and there are a variety of supplements on the market, from pills to drinks, all promising to improve cognitive function.

THE PROOF

A study published in the journal Neurology earlier this year found that a diet rich in omega-3s can increase volume of the part of the brain responsible for memory and protect against dementia. Omega-3s are also believed to reduce the formation of plaque in the brain, which has been linked to Alzheimer’s.

SUPPLEMENT OR DIET?

It is likely that omega-3s from diet alone may be enough to deliver benefits.

Why the eyes must have it

THE CLAIM

The miraculous properties of fish oil can even extend to saving your eyesight in old age – hence the plethora of eye supplements aimed at those aged over 60.

THE PROOF

Experiments carried out at Harvard University demonstrated that mice fed a diet high in omega-3s were less likely to suffer from retinal bleeding – the trigger for many cases of age-related macular degeneration, the leading cause of blindness in the elderly. It may help protect against dry eye syndrome too.

SUPPLEMENT OR DIET?

‘If you eat the recommended amount of fish you should derive enough omega-3s from your diet,’ says Dr Richardson.

Aid stiff joints - with salmon

Pregnant women are advised to limit – but not stop entirely – their consumption of oily fish because of the concern over certain toxins

THE CLAIM

Fish oils help improve the aches and pains suffered by countless rheumatoid arthritis sufferers.

THE PROOF

The anti-inflammatory properties of omega-3s have been shown to benefit those with rheumatoid arthritis, which causes pain and swelling in the joints. High doses over several months are usually needed. Milder joint inflammation is much more common, and this can be reduced by ensuring a good intake of fish and seafood.

SUPPLEMENT OR DIET?

A Swedish study involving 32,000 women found that eating salmon once a week can cut the risk of developing rheumatoid arthritis by half.

Reducing the risk of miscarriage 

THE CLAIM

The dietary advice for pregnant women is constantly changing, but a range of supplements containing fish oils consistently promise to improve the health and wellbeing of expectant mothers and improve the brain development of their unborn child.

THE PROOF

Research has found that fish oils taken in pregnancy can reduce depressive symptoms in the mother, while other studies have shown that levels of fish and seafood consumed by pregnant women even have an effect on the child’s IQ. Meanwhile, a recent Australian study of pregnant rats also showed that a diet rich in omega-3s may reduce the risk of miscarriage by reducing inflammation of the placenta.

SUPPLEMENT OR DIET?

‘Pregnant women are advised to limit – but not stop entirely – their consumption of oily fish because of the concern over certain toxins. Some may feel a daily supplement is a safer way of achieving a beneficial dose,’ says dietician Lucy Jones, of the British Dietetic Association.
