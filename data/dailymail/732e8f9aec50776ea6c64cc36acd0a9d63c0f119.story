Chris Robshaw vowed England can still topple the All Blacks if the two sides clash in next year's World Cup, despite Saturday's loss at Twickenham.

The England captain shrugged off the bitter 'frustration' of a fifth successive defeat to the world champions inside a year. 

Robshaw and his players were left devastated having again pushed New Zealand all the way, only to walk off the rain-soaked Twickenham pitch on the wrong end.

They had so badly wanted to make their own statement of intent just 10 months before England 2015 kicks off at that very ground.

But the Harlequins flanker, whose side led 14-11 at halftime before going down by three points, claimed: 'We could still beat them, especially at home. The crowd were fantastic today and will be right behind us in the World Cup. We had them on the ropes in that first half and we must remember that.

'We had the best team in the world on the ropes and we just need to be able to finish them off and put in a similar second half performance.

'It's extremely frustrating to come so close to beating them but just not getting across the line. We wanted the win but didn't get it.

'We wanted to be the pace-setters and impose ourselves on them because they were coming to our place and we needed to put them on the back foot.

'We did just that with Jonny May scoring an incredible try from 50 metres or so which really got the crowd going.

'But then we were a little ill-disciplined and allowed them to kick some goals and we lost the momentum. 

'Unfortunately, the second half is where we need to take a look at ourselves.'

Robshaw defended his decision to go for a scrum and a try rather than kicking a quick drop goal and saving some time when there were just 90 seconds left on the clock. He insisted: 'I still think it was the right choice. We wanted to win today so I would make the same decision again.'

Robshaw is confident his team will bounce back and go on to enjoy success in the remaining autumn clashes, with South Africa up next on Saturday followed by matches against Samoa and Australia.

He said: 'We'd much rather have started with a win but this will set us up nicely for South Africa. That's going to be another massive physical test for the guys but we will be ready for them. It's important to get this result out of our system quickly and get back on the training ground to prepare for the Springboks.'
