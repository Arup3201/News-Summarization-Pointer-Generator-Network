She may be the most reviled mother in America.

But twisted wellwishers have been helping Casey Anthony toast her final days behind bars by sending her money to buy sweets including KitKats, Skittles and Reese's peanut butter cups.

According to Anthony's jail money account records seen by MailOnline, fans of the 25-year-old – who was this week shockingly acquitted of the murder of her two-year-old daughter – are continuing to send bizarre donations to the inmate from across the country.

Sweet tooth: Casey Anthony has stocked up on Almond Joy bars and packets of Reeses cups, KitKats and Skittles thanks to the bizarre donations

Funds in her Orange County jail account reached $301.18 yesterday and the money is still coming in. Anthony can spend the cash on snacks and beauty products from the jail's commissary.

Strangers from Iowa, Pennsylvania and even Canada have been sending $10 and $20 money orders.

Records reveal that sweet-toothed Anthony has been buying lots of candy as she gets ready for her release in nine days' time on Sunday 17 July.

In the last two weeks, Anthony has bought Almond Joy bars as well as packets of Skittles, KitKats and Reese's peanut butter cups.

Other items purchased include nachos with cheese and a jalapeno dip, flour tortillas and peanut butter.

Anthony was yesterday returned to her 
small cell in Orange County jail where she is locked up 23 hours a day 
in protective custody.

Allen Moore of Orange County Corrections Department said that even though Anthony has been cleared of murder, she is still being kept in the maximum security level one 'dormitory L'.

'Nothing has changed,' he told MailOnline.

There she will spend her final days in 
custody under close surveillance in the cell which has a clear door and 
contains just a bed, toilet and sink.

She is allowed one hour a day for a shower or to go to the library or recreation area. Prisoners are allowed a 45-minute videophone call per day.

There is no interaction with other inmates and lights in the cells are never turned off. Lights are dimmed at 10pm or 11pm and switched back on at 4am.

Meanwhile, Anthony and her parents George and Cindy and her brother Lee were today offered $1 million to appear on The Jerry Springer Show.

According
to reports, the offer for a family showdown was made to Anthony's legal
team on Friday morning and is under consideration.

As the young Florida woman prepares for freedom after what will have been 1,043 days in prison, concerns are continuing to build for her safety.

In a statement Orange County Corrections Department last night said:  'Due to the high profile nature of this case and intense, emotional interest by the public, appropriate measures will be taken to release the individual into the community in such a manner so as to preserve the safety of the individual and the public.'

Judge Belvin Perry yesterday refused to lift a ban identifying the twelve jurors who voted to find Anthony not guilty because of similar worries.

Protests: Security fears have been raised for Anthony and the jurors who acquitted her after the verdict outraged America

'Our landscape in this country has 
changed. People have no reservation… about walking up to an individual, 
pulling a gun or knife… and because they disagree with them, hurt them 
or kill them,' he told a hearing.

'You realise there are folks out there 
that want to do crazy things… like fillet someone open, pour salt on 
them and feed their legs to a piranha?'

Mr Perry said that one juror has expressed 'serious security' concerns as people had started contacted their relatives and children, staking out their house and following them around.

The owner of one restaurant in Clearwater has banned the jurors from his eating at his establishment.

John McClure has put a handwritten message on the door of his restaurant Skyline Chili, which reads: 'Pinella County jurors NOT welcome!'

It is not clear where Anthony will go on her release or what she will do.
