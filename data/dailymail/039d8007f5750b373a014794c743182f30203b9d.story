Corrupt court clerk David Kelly, 47, has been jailed for six years for helping more than 70 motorists to falsify their driving records and escape bans

A corrupt court official who helped more than 70 motorists to falsify their driving records and escape bans has been jailed for six years.

David Kelly, 47, committed a 'gross breach of trust' in a betrayal of the criminal justice system, his colleagues and the general public, said a judge.

Debt-ridden Kelly operated the scam from his workplace in the admin department at Liverpool Magistrates’ Court.

He assisted 71 drivers in removing details of their convictions, disqualifications and penalty points on 110 occasions between 2004 and 2010.

Preston Crown Court heard that drivers would pass on cash to 'middle men' who had contacts within the Liverpool underworld and their details would be handed to Kelly.

The defendant then sent forms from the court to the DVLA to request the alterations.

Sentencing him, Judge Graham Knowles QC said: 'Liverpool City Magistrates’ (Court) ran like every other magistrates’ court.

'The magistrates, the clerks and the office staff dealt with penalty points, so did the staff of the Central Ticketing Office. Civil servants in Swansea (at the DVLA) kept the drivers’ records.

'But unknown to all of these decent people, you, Kelly, were running a corrupt business at the court, bypassing justice after everyone thought it had been done.'

It is understood that most of the corrupt payments from members of the public were made in pubs across Liverpool with £100 thought to be the going rate for erasing one penalty point.

DVLA officers in Swansea first became suspicious of Kelly in September 2008 when he faxed a number of bogus forms, said the Crown.

But Kelly, of Southern Crescent, Toxteth, was cleared to continue working after an internal investigation and was finally caught in April 2010 when court staff discovered bogus forms and driver details in a confidential waste sack.

Yesterday, a jury found him guilty of conspiracy to pervert the court of justice.

Three of his 'customers' who were in the dock with him - Shaun Robinson, Samantha Evans and Mark Camello - were convicted of perverting the course of justice.

Camello, 33, of Nightingale Road, Toxteth, was jailed for 14 months, while Evans, 25, of Meldon Close, West Derby, and Robinson, 24, of Britannia Crescent, Toxteth, were each jailed for 12 months.

Kelly had worked at the court for 20 years before he turned to corruption.

Judge Knowles told him: 'You perverted justice systematically and cunningly. You acted in gross breach of trust.

'You betrayed justice, the public, the magistrates and your decent, hard-working colleagues who like court staff everywhere are proud to play their part in justice.'

He said Kelly continued the scam despite suspicion falling on him in September 2008, as he took on extra precautions such as changing his handwriting.

Kelly also attempted to 'cast wholly unfounded suspicion' on former colleagues as his trial approached, the judge added.

Addressing the other three defendants, Judge Knowles said: 'However much or little thought you gave to it that there had been a corrupt official to tamper with your records, there had to be make the scheme work.

'You knew that the corrupt official had an agent in the field - meeting you and many others in pubs and wherever else.

'You took your details and cash to hand them to the man you now know as David Kelly.

'Whether you were approached or you approached them, it is clear you were joining yourself to an ongoing and widespread crime and lining the pockets of a corrupt court official and a middle man.

'You thought what you was doing was easy and cheap at the price. That must be seen as wrong.

'It is my duty to deter other people from joining in this type of scheme and this type of offending.

'You thought you could buy off justice with corruption. That strikes at the heart of the system and makes a mockery of justice.'

All four defendants had denied the charges.

The court heard Camello had a previous conviction for conspiracy to commit grievous bodily harm.

He had wanted to avoid a second driving ban after a previous disqualification for drink driving.

Robinson had only learned the day before yesterday’s conviction that he had earned his Bachelor of Science degree. This had now been 'sabotaged by his conviction', said the judge.

A number of motorists involved in the scam have already been jailed for committing the same offence and Judge Knowles said he could not make an exception for Robinson.

'They include people with established families, careers, businesses, and people without those things,' he said.

'People of all ages, people in various states of health. Many will not have the opportunity you will have in time to start afresh.'

Preston Crown Court, pictured, heard that drivers would pass on cash to 'middle men' who had contacts within the Liverpool underworld and their details would be handed to Kelly.

Following sentencing, detective chief inspector Andy O’Connor said: 'The public quite rightly have high expectations of those who work within the criminal justice system.

'Public corruption is an extremely serious offence that undermines public faith in the integrity of those who work in the criminal justice system.

'Public servants are required to act with integrity, honesty, objectivity and impartiality but Kelly’s actions could not have been further from each of these.

'His actions have undermined the criminal justice system and the very laws which he was employed to uphold.

'We are quite clear, no one is above the law, Kelly abused his position and also let down his colleagues who day in, day out provide a professional and quality service to the people of Liverpool.

'The investigation into this matter took more than three years and I would like to thank all of those involved for their hard work in bringing this man to justice.'

Fingerprint evidence and a handwriting expert proved that Kelly wrote and submitted numerous documents to the DVLA to request that points be removed from the licences

Dana Gledhill, senior crown prosecutor for CPS North West, said: 'Fingerprint evidence and a handwriting expert proved that Mr Kelly wrote and submitted numerous documents to the DVLA to request that points be removed from the licences.

'Computer evidence showed that he then checked the progress of these requests on the computer system which was linked with the DVLA.

'He was first caught out when points were removed from licences on cases which had not even been sentenced at Liverpool Magistrates’ Court; cases which he had no authority to deal with.

'He abused his position within the court system to commit these offences and his actions and subsequent conviction jeopardise the public’s faith and trust in the criminal justice system.

'The Crown Prosecution Service and the police will seek to bring before the courts all those who commit such offences.'
