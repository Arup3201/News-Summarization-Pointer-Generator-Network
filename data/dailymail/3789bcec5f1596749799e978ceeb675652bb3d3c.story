Fierce: Police have been forced to pay out compensation to four students bitten by riot dogs in a crackdown on a student party in Leeds. (File picture)

A former university student bitten in the testicles by a police dog is one of four paid more than £75,000 compensation after authorities cracked down on a noisy student party.

West Yorkshire Police made an out-of-court settlement averaging almost £19,000 each to the four former students bitten by the dogs as heavily armed riot police moved in.

One of the organisers of the party said it was proof the police reaction was heavy-handed.

But the force, despite admitting the compensation claims were 'unlikely to be successfully defended', nevertheless continued to defend its officers' actions.

Riot police were called to the house party in the Hyde Park area of Leeds, West Yorkshire, attended by hundreds of people, in May 2007 after reports that it was out of control.

It is claimed that orders to the partygoers to disperse were ignored and missiles thrown at officers, prompting them to unleash the dogs to clear the crowds.

Now the force has paid out a total of £75,725 and issued formal apologies to the victims.

Will Hillier, now 27, was studying at Leeds Metropolitan University at the time and helped to organise the party. He admitted that the party had become too big but said the police reaction 'antagonised' the situation.

'The first thing a lot of people knew about what was going on was when they were being attacked,' he said.

'We heard that one guy had been bitten on his testicles. Another guy claimed he was attacked while trying to protect his girlfriend.

'The way it was handled by police exacerbated the problem.'

Three arrests were made at the time 
over alleged public order offences, but they are not thought to have 
resulted in court prosecutions.

Several formal complaints about the incident were investigated by police and found to be unsubstantiated.

The force said settlements were made out of court because the compensation claims were 'unlikely to be successfully defended'.

Mr Hillier added: 'I’m glad the police had paid out. It proves they were heavy-handed.'

But Chief Superintendant Dave Oldroyd, commander of north-west Leeds division, defended his officers' actions. He said officers spent 90 minutes ordering the crowd to disperse, but were ignored.

He said 'public order tactics' were used to clear the area after missiles were thrown at police.

'Out of a crowd of hundreds, four people were later paid compensation over police dog bite injuries,' he said.

'We have rightly apologised to those individuals but we make no apology for our overall response to a situation which, if allowed to run out of control, presented a genuine threat to public safety.'
