Apple CEO Tim Cook recently said, 'China, the sky's the limit there,' at an earnings conference.

The Apple Store in Beijing is among the company's highest earners.

But a court in China has ruled that a local tech company, Proview, which registered the name 'iPad' in China in 2001, still owns the trademark - and Apple doesn't.

The official Chinese news agency Xinhua reported that Proview Shenzhen will seek to claim 10 billion yuan (£1 billion)
 in compensation from Apple for copyright infringement.

Apple iPad 2: A court in Southern China ruled that a local company, Proview, owns the trademark 'iPad', having registered it in 2001

The court, in southern China, claim by Apple Inc. that a Hong Kong-headquartered tech company has violated its iPad trademark, in the latest development in a case that could affect the U.S. company’s financial prospects in the country.

Apple’s Beijing-based spokeswoman Carolyn Wu declined to comment Thursday on the decision by the Municipal Intermediate People’s Court in the southern city of Shenzhen.

The court said on its website that it dismissed a lawsuit Monday by Apple against Shenzhen Proview Technology over the ownership of the iPad trademark.

The company is a subsidiary of LCD screen maker Proview International Holdings Ltd., headquartered in Hong Kong.

Apple and its resellers in China are fighting in court against a US$1.5 billion (1.12 billion euro) claim by monitor manufacturer Proview International that it holds the rights to the name in mainland China

The court ruled that the Shenzhen company is not bound by a 2009 agreement that its Taiwanese affiliate, Proview Taipei, made with Apple to transfer the trademarks to the Cupertino, California-based company for 35,000 pounds ($54,700).

Proview in Taiwan had registered the trademark in various countries as early as 2000, while Proview in Shenzhen registered the trademark in China in 2001.

According to the Shenzhen court decision, Apple says its trademark transfer agreement with Proview’s Taiwanese company should also apply to the Shenzhen company, but the court rejected that, saying that the Shenzhen company was not involved in those negotiations.

The U.S. company has the right to appeal the verdict.
