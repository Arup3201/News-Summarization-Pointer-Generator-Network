Cattle across Switzerland are being deafened by their own cow bells - which make more noise than a chainsaw on full-throttle, scientists have claimed.

Farmers have been warned not to adorn their livestock with the traditional 12lb-bells in a move that could signal the death of one of the country's most iconic symbols.

The large bells -  primarily used by farmers to locate cattle grazing on alpine pastures - can reach volumes of up to 113 decibels, which is louder than a chainsaw or a pneumatic drill.

Worse still, researchers found that cows who wear the iron gongs eat less than their bell-free companions, although they aren't sure if that is down to their noise or weight.

The findings were revealed in a paper  by agricultural scientist Julia Johns and her team of researchers at the  Swiss Federal Institute of Technology in Zurich (ETHZ).

They spent months testing more than 100 cows in 25 farms, monitoring their activity, head movements, reactions to sound and feeding behaviour.

The paper suggests that thousands of cows – whose hearing is more sensitive than a human's – may already be irreversibly deaf.

Anger: One farmer pointed out that the 12lb-bells used in the study were in fact size 31 and only used for one day a year on ceremonial occasions, like this in Grimetz, in the Swiss Alps

Lolita Morena of the Swiss animal protection group told daily Le Matin: 'We didn't need long university research to tell us that the bells are not beneficial to cows.

'Farmers will just have to spend a bit more time finding their cows in bad weather, like shepherds do. It's difficult work... but they chose it.'

Johns suggested technology could be the answer, saying: 'In this IT age we could replace the bell with a microchip and the farmer could then locate his cattle using a smartphone.'

But farmers have reacted angrily to her suggestion, claiming GPS signal would be patchy at best in the remote and hilly terrain of the Swiss mountains.  

'They can't be serious,' responded Jacques Bourgeois, director of the Swiss Countryside Union, in Le Matin. 'These researchers have completely missed the point. I wonder if they've even stepped out of their lab and been to the mountains.'

He pointed out that the 12lb-bells used in the study were in fact size 31 and only used for one day a year on ceremonial occasions. 

Swiss Tourism spokesperson Véronique Kanel was also displeased with the findings, saying: 'It would be the end of a myth, of an image of Switzerland.'

The row continues.
