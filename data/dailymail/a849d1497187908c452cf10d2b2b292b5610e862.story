Richard III's remains were discovered underneath a car park in Leicester last year

King Richard III will be laid to rest in a £1million raised tomb.

Leicester Cathedral, which will raise the money itself, said the design will be ready in September.

Once the Cathedrals Fabric Commission for England approves it, the last Yorkist king will be  re-interred next May.

However, the Plantagenet Alliance, a 
group of Richard’s relatives, has applied to the High Court for a 
judicial review into the plans for the site.

University of Leicester archaeologists found the remains after a dig in a city car park.

If all goes to plan the cathedral is hoping Richard’s remains can be re-interred in a ceremony full of pomp.

However, those plans also rely on the
outcome of a legal challenge from the Plantagenet Alliance.

The group, made up of Richard’s relatives, have applied to the High Court for
a judicial review into the decision to grant the city cathedral licence
as the final resting place for the king’s bones.

The cathedral must also raise £1 
million to pay for alterations to the building, a new floor, lighting, 
stained glass windows and the ceremony itself.

Richard’s remains were discovered by 
archaeologists from the University of Leicester after a dig in a city 
car park, following a campaign by the Richard III Society and with the 
permission of Leicester City Council, which owned the plot of ground.

Architects Van Heyningen and Haward have now released an artist impression of the newly raised tomb and surrounding area.

Richard III was discovered squashed into a very small and badly prepared 'lozenge'-shaped pit as gravediggers rushed to bury him

Richard III was identified by analysing his his curved spine - he was reputed to have a hunched back - and the injuries he was reported to have sustained. During the latest dig, archaeologists will make a large trench measuring 25m by 17m around the area where his skeleton was found

It was one woman's hunch led to the discovery of the skeleton which has now been proven to be that of Richard III.Screenwriter Philippa Langley said she felt a chill on a hot summer's day in 2009 as she walked through the area where it was thought he was buried.

Miss Langley initially funded the excavation of what is now a Leicester City Council car park because she was '99 per cent certain' that the remains were those of Richard.

Dr Phil Stone, chairman of the 
Richard III Society, was delighted with the architects’ work and said: 
'I think that the design is absolutely fantastic.'

The Dean of Leicester, The Very Rev 
David Monteith, said: 'We have listened carefully to the different views
that were expressed.

'We want to create a really wonderful
space in the cathedral for him and the many thousands of people we know
will want to come to visit and pay their respects.'

Professor Sir Bob Burgess, University
of Leicester vice chancellor, said he was 'confident' the re-interment 
plans would properly honour Richard - the last English king to die in 
battle.

King Richard III was killed at the 
Battle of Bosworth in 1485 bringing to a close the tumultuous period of 
English history known as the Wars of the Roses.
