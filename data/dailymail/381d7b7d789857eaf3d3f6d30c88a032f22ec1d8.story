Alan Shearer has posed on Twitter wearing one of Rio Ferdinand's '5 Unity' caps. The former Manchester United defender must be incredibly persuasive.

The duo are currently sharing a sofa as part of BBC's World Cup coverage, but with the quarter-final game between Brazil and Colombia being shown on rival broadcaster ITV, there was clearly time for the team (and Robbie Savage, spotted in the background) to unwind in Rio on Saturday night.

Ferdinand tweeted: 'oi oi go on Big Al in the #5Unity!'

The cap was released by Ferdinand as part of his fashion range, with his trademark '5' logo featuring a montage of every nation's flag featured in this summer's World Cup.

And Shearer's not the first to be snapped wearing the cap, with the likes of Robin van Persie and Thierry Henry also among those to have donned it.

For the former England striker, however, it seems a little more like a mixture of the Brazilian weather and a Saturday night on Copacabana beach had a bit of a part to play.

But let's face it, we've all been in holiday pictures that we'll live to regret in time to come.
