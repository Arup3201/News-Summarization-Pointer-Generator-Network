Comedian Russell Brand’s father was facing bankruptcy in court today after racking up £13,000 in unpaid rent on a Camden flat.

Businessman Ron, 67, was granted a reprieve at court today after missing months of payments on the north London apartment he left last year.

Brand told Guildford County Court today that he had now paid back £7,000 of the money he owes and would get the rest together within two weeks.

Not close: Russell Brand's father Ron, left, has refused to put pressure on his millionaire son by asking for financial help

‘I’ll pay the rest back in 14 days,’ he cheerfully told the judge. ‘I’ve got half of it in my jacket pocket.’

An ‘order of sale’ has been applied for 
on his new home in Farnham, Surrey, which would force him to sell up to 
pay the debt - but it is thought there is not enough equity in the flat 
to cover the full amount.

Deputy District Judge David Phillips, agreed not to proceed with the bankruptcy but warned him if the money was not paid by the two-week deadline he would have him back in court.

‘It’s really time this was sorted out,’ added Judge Phillips.

Brand appeared without a lawyer to represent him. The claimants, Lownie Investments, were represented by Ms Sarah Clarke.

Ms Clarke said she was satisfied with the offer made and the case was adjourned for two weeks.

Brand has refused to put pressure on his millionaire son by asking for help.

The pair have had a strained relationship in the past, but currently appear to be on good terms.

Relationship ups and downs: Russell Brand, 37, is now dating Isabella Brewster following his divorce from singer Katy Perry last month

Ron walked out on his six-month-old son and wife Barbara at their modest home in ­Brentwood, Essex after six years of marriage.

He  later blamed the failure of his marriage on the stress of working long hours as he tried to make a success of his photography studio business.

Over the years, he was to try his hand at everything from selling water filters to market trading.

After Barbara, he married twice more, each time to a woman more than 14 years his junior.

He stayed in touch with Russell, taking him to his first West Ham game, and hiring him a prostitute in Thailand when he was 16 in a misguided attempt to introduce him to adulthood.

‘He is a very different character to me,’ Russell, 37, has said. ‘Supporting West Ham was one of the ways we bonded.

‘He is a typical working-class bloke, so football and women were the only things we had in common.’

Russell now lives in Los Angeles and is dating Isabella Brewster, sister of Fast and Furious star Jordana - his first serious ­relationship since his divorce from Katy Perry last month.
