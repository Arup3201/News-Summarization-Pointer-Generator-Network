Kymberlie Shepherd had always dreamed of becoming a mother.

It was set to become a reality when the 26-year-old went into labour last Thursday at a Perth hospital with her fiancée Wayde Kelly by her side.

But minutes away from giving birth to Kyden Thomas Bede Kelly, things took a tragic turn. 

Ms Shepherd passed away  after suffering an amniotic fluid embolism - a rare complication that occurs 6.1 times in every 100,000 deliveries.

Wayde Kelly and Kymberlie Shepherd were expecting their first child when the 26-year-old went in labour in Perth last Thursday. But minutes away from giving birth, things took a tragic turn

The 26-year-old dance teacher passed away after suffering a rare complication as she was giving birth to their son, Kyden Thomas Bede Kelly

'Everything was going well. Kymmy had been given the gas to help relieve the pain, but she still did her make up again so she was looking how she wanted for the photos after the birth,' Mr Kelly told Daily Mail Australia.

'She was pushing hard and they said the baby was close. I looked up to change her iPod as she told me she was light-headed. 

'As they got the oxygen on her, she just lost consciousness, let go of my hand and had a fit. 

'It's something I will never forget.' 

Mr Kelly said he experienced 'mixed emotions' meeting his son Kyden for the very first time

He was told Kyden was born at 10.36am but couldn't bring himself to see him for an hour because he was worried about his partner

Mr Kelly said the couple had never heard of an amniotic fluid embolism and never predicted something like this could happen.

'I was told Kyden was born at 10.36am, but Kym was in a serious condition. I couldn't even go and see him for an hour as I just wanted to know about Kym,' he said. 

'They worked on her for two hours before they stopped and just said she was fighting and while she was they would too.  

'We were told at about 12.15pm that she had passed away and I just sat in tears and shock at the table.'

He said he was glad there were so many people out there who would be able to tell their son what type of person his mother was

Mr Kelly said he experienced 'mixed emotions' meeting his son for the first time.

'It was Kymmy's dream to hold him. I didn't think I could enjoy it without her. But I wanted to see if I could find a positive in anything and I did,' he said. 

The couple, who got engaged last December after four years together, had spoken often about having a baby and decided now was the perfect time after she was made a permanent dance teacher at Safety Bay Senior High School.

'She would have made the best mum. Having a baby was the one thing she had always wanted to do,' he said. 

'We were so excited. Kymmy had the baby's room and absolutely everything sorted. 

'She was just the most selfless, kind, caring and giving person.'

Mr Kelly said it was Kym's dream to hold their son and she would have made the best mother

He was unsure if would enjoy being a father without Kym, but said he wanted to find a positive out of losing her

Mr Kelly proposed to Ms Shepherd last December at Mount Warning in Queensland after four years together.

The couple, who had lived together in London for two years and travelled extensively, recently moved to Perth to start their life together.

'My favourite thing about her was her bubbly personality and infectious smile,' Mr Kelly said. 

'Everyone she met knew who she was and I have never heard a bad word said about her.'

He said he was glad there were so many people out there who would be able to tell their son what type of person his mother was. 

'I will tell him she had such an amazing impact on everyone she came in contact with,' he said. 

'She had such a love of life and I'll tell him that she would want him to do what he loved.'

Following Ms Shepherd's tragic death, Mr Kelly now wants to raise awareness about amniotic fluid embolism.

'It is the number one cause for maternal death in developed nations, but no one I know or had spoken to had any real knowledge about it,' he said. 

'I didn't even know if could happen before the birth.

'I just hope that somewhere down the track, someone, somewhere can come up with an epipen-like solution that could be available in all birthing suites.' 

Mr Kelly plans to move back to the Gold Coast where both their families are to raise Kyden.
