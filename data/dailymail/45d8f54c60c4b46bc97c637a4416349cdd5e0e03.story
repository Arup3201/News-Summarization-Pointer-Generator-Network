Advert: Russian tennis player Anna Kournikova advertised the Shock Absorber sports bra range

Three of Britain's biggest department stores have been accused of colluding in a three year scheme to rip off thousands of consumers by fixing the price of sports bras.

John Lewis, Debenhams and House of Fraser could face fines totalling more than £1billion if found guilty by the UK's competition authority.

The Office of Fair Trading (OFT) alleges the high street giants teamed up with DB Apparel to set the price of its Shock Absorber sports bra range on nine separate occasions between 2008 and 2011.

DB Apparel, which also owns other brassiere brands including Wonderbra and Playex, allegedly told the retailers how much to sell its bras for - and even when to raise prices by as little as 50p.

Shock Absorber was one of the most popular brands in the market, accounting for one of every six sports bras sold in the UK at the time.

'The OFT takes allegations of price-fixing seriously,' said Ann Pope, a senior director at the OFT.

'Resale price maintenance limits competition between retailers and can lead to consumers paying higher prices.'

The recommended retail price for Shock Absorber's bras ranges from £25 to £38.

But the manufacturer cannot dictate to retailers how much to charge for their wares. As a result most stores and websites sell the products at a much lower rate to try and undercut competitors.

The four available bras on John Lewis website yesterday cost between £18 and £31.

What the OFT is alleging is that, rather than suggesting the price to John Lewis, Debenhams and House of Fraser, DB Apparel told the three exactly what prices to charge, and even when to bring in increases.

All three agreed with DB Apparel to these charges for the group's Spring and Summer ranges between 2008 and 2011, it is alleged.

It is not known whether each of the retailers knew whether their rivals were in collusion with the clothing supplier.

The news yesterday follows a 17 month-long investigation by the OFT into the alleged affair.

Each
of the groups - John Lewis, Debenhams, House of Fraser and DB Apparel -
could face a fine of up to 10per cent of their global turnover if found
guilty.

For John Lewis, the largest group, this could land it with a hefty charge of £950million.

Debenhams,
which last year reported annual sales of £2.2billion, could face a 
charge of £220million, while House of Fraser could end up with a 
£120million fine.

DB Apparel UK limited, the smallest of the group, only reported sales of £39million last year, so would face the smallest charge.

But the group's parent company, which is registered in Paris, does not report results in the UK.

None of the retailers would last night say how many bras they had sold in the period, or how much money they had made from the sales.

'We reject any allegations by the OFT that we have entered into any agreement or understanding with retailers as to their retail prices of our products,' said a spokesman for DB Apparel.

'We have been transparent with UK authorities since the beginning of this process and will continue to defend ourselves vigorously in this investigation.'

A John Lewis spokesman said: 'John Lewis always strives to operate within the law and comply with regulations. We are fully cooperating with the OFT and will respond in due course.'

A spokesman for Debenhams said: 'Debenhams disputes these provisional findings of the OFT but is not in a position to comment further at this stage. The matter is being dealt with by its external lawyers.'

A House of Fraser spokesman said: 'We are co-operating fully with the Office of Fair Trading and the ongoing investigation and will respond accordingly.

'We are confident that we have been operating within all laws and regulations and are very supportive of any initiative which ensures pricing policies are fair for our customers.'
