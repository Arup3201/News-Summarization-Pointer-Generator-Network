Wasps will unlock the doors to the Ricoh Arena this week boosted by the news that Christian Wade is in contention to make his comeback in the Coventry curtain-raiser against London Irish.

Sportsmail understands the England winger resumed full training on Monday and hopes to feature on Sunday for the first time since suffering an ankle injury in last month’s Aviva Premiership defeat by Exeter.

It has been a frustrating six months for the 23-year-old, who was ruled out of the club’s last ever game at Adams Park and also missed both the autumn series and summer tour of New Zealand. 

But he hopes to return for Sunday’s landmark fixture, which could bring logistical teething problems for the newly Midlands-based side, who will stay in a Coventry hotel on Saturday night.

‘I don’t think there will be a lot of disruption,’ said captain James Haskell. ‘Being in a hotel on site will get a lot of the boys out of their comfort zone, which I don’t think is a bad thing.

‘You can get spoiled with a bit of luxury. I learned not to be precious and spoiled pretty early on and that teaches you to get on with it and focus on what makes you tick.

‘We’re going to “Waspify” the changing room. We have been very respectful to Coventry, but we’ll put banners up and make it very Wasps. We’re not changing the seating or anything like that so I hope the off-field team at Wasps have flags and things prepared for the crowd to lay a marker down.’ 

Attendance figures are expected to reach a season’s high in Sunday’s fixture, with ticket sales already surpassing the previous record of 22,700.

The club are laying on transport for supporters from High Wycombe, where they struggled to attract decent-sized crowds in recent years.

Haskell is the club’s longest- serving player, having made his senior debut back in 2002.

He has been involved with the ex-London side for most of their 12-year association with Adams Park, but is not fazed by the relocation.

‘If you asked any other member of the squad they will probably tell you it will be weird,’ said Haskell. ‘For me, it doesn’t matter. The most important thing is the performance and making sure we are there emotionally. That’s going to be the biggest test.

‘If I’m being frank, for 99 per cent of the guys Sunday was another day at the office. They don’t all share that emotion with Adams Park and this team is completely different from when I came in. The only things the same are the name, the kit man and me.’

Meanwhile, Exeter flanker Tom Johnson will make his comeback in an A League game next week having missed the season so far with a neck injury.
