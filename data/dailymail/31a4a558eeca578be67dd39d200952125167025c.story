A movie fan got the shock of her life when her boyfriend proposed to her by means of a message projected onto the cinema screen in front of a packed - and rather surprised - audience.

Colin Brownjohn, 34, from Kimberley, Nottingham, surprised girlfriend Rachel Langford, 38, as they celebrated their one-year anniversary last week.

First, the hopeless romantic took his unsuspecting partner to Turtle Bay restaurant in Nottingham, where the couple enjoyed their first date together.

After dinner they then went to their local Showcase Cinema to watch an early evening screening of 'Guardians of the Galaxy'.

But as they got comfortable in their seats and waited for the Marvel Comics superhero film to start, romantic music began to play.

Suddenly messages popped up on the screen from Colin, which read: 'My life will never be the same without you in it.'

'I love you Rachel. Would you do me the honour of becoming my wife?'

The drug and alcohol support worker then got down on one knee and asked his girlfriend to marry him in front of stunned film-goers.

Human resources adviser Rachel explained: 'I was just so shocked and happy.

'He had to prompt me, asking me "are you saying yes?" but there was no hesitation.

'I am still getting loads of messages about it and it just feels really exciting.

'My friends think he's a legend for doing this for me.'

Celebration time: The loved up pair are now planning to tie the knot next year, on their second anniversary 

After Colin's proposal and Rachel's joyful acceptance, the couple settled back down to enjoy the rest of the film. However, Rachel said she found it difficult to concentrate as she kept looking at her dazzling new ring.

The surprise proposal took two weeks to plan, with Colin making phone calls and sending emails to bosses at the Showcase Cinema behind Rachel's back.

He added: 'I wanted to do something a little bit different.

'I just thought, we'd be sitting there, it would come up on screen and be a total surprise for her.

'Everyone thought it was lovely, something original. I think Rachel's friends were quite jealous.'

Rachel's mother Allison Gurling, 57, who was in on the act, says: 'It was very romantic - it was such a lovely thing to do.

'Most people don't get proposals like that. I am so happy that he did that for my daughter.'
