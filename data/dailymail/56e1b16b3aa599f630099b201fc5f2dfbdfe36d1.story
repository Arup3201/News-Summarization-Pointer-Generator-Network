A British investigator and his American wife have been jailed in China today after being convicted of  illegally trading the personal details of Chinese businessmen and officials.

Peter Humphrey, 58, was fined £19,000 and sentenced to two years and six months in a Chinese prison for 'illegally obtaining private information', after which he will be deported. 

His wife, Yingzeng Yu, 61, must serve two years and pay a fine of £14,500. It is unclear whether or not she will also be deported on completion of her jail term.

Jailed: British corporate investigator Peter Humphrey leaves the the Shanghai No.1 Intermediate People's Court inside a police vehicle in Shanghai after receiving sentence of two years and six months

The pair worked for companies in the Far East - including Pharmaceutical giant GlaxoSmithKline - and helped firms screen potential business partners or employees.

Speaking before their verdict was given, Humphrey and his wife offered a closing statement to the court, in which they expressed deep regret for their actions, the South China Morning Post reports. 

Humphrey spoke about his childhood love and fascination of China and claimed he longed to be part of its development. He also said that he had always supported anti-corruption in the country.

He stated: 'My wife and I still love and respect China passionately.'

As part of the prosecution's case, Shanghai police claimed that several dozen reports prepared by Humphrey and Yu for corporate clients contained information that 'seriously violated the legitimate rights of citizens'.

This morning, Humphrey said he purchased information from three Chinese investigators who obtained it from law firms and other sources, according to a trial transcript released by the court in Shanghai.

'We would ask other consulting companies to help us and they could help us obtain the personal information of Chinese citizens,' Humphrey said.

According to the transcript, Yu said she did know that the consultants her and her husband's firm hired to get the data had done so illegally.

'In other countries, we were able to conduct similar checks, including personal information and private transactions, legally through courts,' said Yu. 'If we had known that it was illegal, my husband and I would have destroyed all traces of this information.'

Humphrey and Yu worked under contract for British pharmaceutical giant GlaxoSmithKline, which is accused in a separate case of bribing Chinese doctors and hospitals to use its products.

Their arrest last August coincided with an investigation of Glaxo, but authorities have not indicated whether the two cases are linked. 

The probe came as Beijing tightened controls over information and prompted warnings that investigation of legitimate matters might be curtailed.

A conviction appeared almost certain after Chinese state television showed Humphrey last year apparently saying he used 'illegal means' to obtain information.  

Humphrey told the court this morning that he bought information from Chinese investigators, according a transcript from the trial

Earlier, the couple's teenage son, Harvey, expressed his anguish at the prospect of them not being home for the start of his university career.

The 19-year-old, who has been allowed to watch the trial of his parents from the public gallery, told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: 'They've been in prison for about 13 months now, almost 14 months. I think it's likely you are going to have a lenient sentence.

'The justice system in China usually works better for the defendant if he or she pleads guilty.

'So I'm cautiously optimistic about that and - touch wood - hopefully they'll be free to join me in the UK when I start university.'

The information said to have been gathered by the couple could have been used to reveal links between people and companies. This can be vital to foreign firms in a Chinese business world dominated by behind-the-scenes personal connections.

Humphrey and Yu's firm, ChinaWhys Ltd, said on its website it specialised in 'discreet risk mitigation solutions' and investigations 'walking multinationals through the labyrinth of opportunity, risk and unfamiliar cultural environment'. 

According the court transcript, Humphrey said he got information for companies from Chinese investigators

At the time of their August 16 arrest last year, Shanghai police said they were investigating 126 people on suspicion of improperly gathering personal information and had detained 35. Few details of the other cases have been released.

On Friday, Humphrey complained that Chinese authorities had translated his use of the word 'monitoring' in a report as spying. He said most of his firm's information came from the Internet or talking to employees of clients' companies.

'We never engaged in such behavior as stalking or spying. If our clients wanted us to, I would tell them, better not,' he said. 

Beijing began tightening control over corporate information in early 2012 after Chinese companies were hit by disclosures about possible financial misconduct.

Possibly in response to that, regulations issued in February 2012 prohibit government agencies from disclosing financial or commercial information about a company without its permission.

That made it harder for companies to investigate potential Chinese partners or acquisition targets to find liabilities or conflicts of interest. Known as 'due diligence,' it is a common practice in other countries.

Other companies that supply information also are under pressure.

In January 2013 four Chinese employees of a unit of Dun & Bradstreet Corp, which provides credit and other company information, were sentenced to prison on charges of improperly buying personal data of Chinese citizens. The company was fined one million yuan (£95,000).

Also in 2012, communist leaders were embarrassed by news reports that disclosed details of the family wealth of Xi Jinping, the new ruling party leader, and Wen Jiabao, who was prime minister at that time.

Humphrey has worked as an investigator for the past 14 years in Asia, focusing on white-collar crime prevention and fraud investigation, according to his company's website.

It said Yu has worked for or advised companies in the United States, Hong Kong and China in technology, medical products and other industries over a 25-year business career.
