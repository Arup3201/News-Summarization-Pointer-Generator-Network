A soldier attacked over the weekend at a bar by a gang of six Russians may never move again, his family said today.

Specialist Korry McClanahan, 25, was set upon and beaten outside Steel Creek American Whiskey Co. in Tacoma, Washington, where he had been playing pool with a friend on Friday night.

The father-of-one's family are now holding a bedside vigil at Madigan Army Medical Center, where doctors were forced to remove a piece of Spec. McClanahan's skull to relieve swelling to his brain.

'He doesn't look like my son right now,' his mother, Lisa Senecal, told KiroTV through tears. 'No mother, no father, no family should have to go through what our family is going through. They don't know what the long term affect is going to be.'

The attack happened after Spec. McClanahan and his friend, also a soldier, stepped outside the bar to smoke and they were approached by a group of men, speaking in Russian, spoiling for a fight.

Spec. McClanahan, who had only moved to nearby Joint Base Lewis-McChord from Fort Hood, Texas, a few weeks ago, tried to walk away from the confrontation but the group 'bum rushed' him, according to his friend.

He was punched so hard in the face that he was knocked instantly unconscious, hitting his head on the sidewalk as he fell.

The soldier says the men then piled into a black Infiniti G35, model year 2005 or 2006, and sped off into the night.

Police are now hunting the men and ask for anyone with information that may lead to their arrest to call the Tacoma Police Department.

'If someone is going to put his career to an end, they should also have their career ended and receive justice. I think they should be brought to justice plain and simple,' cousin Bradin McClanahan told Komo News.

Ms Senecal added: 'They have to be caught.'

Meanwhile, Spec. McClanahan's parents say doctors plan to take him off of the ventilator 
soon to see if he can breathe on his own, but he will still face an 
extensive recovery.

When the sedation wears off, they'll know better the effects of his injuries.

Spec. McClanahan is originally from Corona, California, where he has a 4-year-old son.
