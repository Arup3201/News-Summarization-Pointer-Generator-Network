SeaWorld Orlando has ended public dolphin feedings at its park and will now charge visitors to spend short amounts of time with the sea creatures.

Guests at the Florida location will still be able to pet the dolphins, but they will no longer be able to buy $7 trays of fish to lure the mammals over to the side of their enclosure.

They will be able to pay $15 to spend 10 minutes with the clever animals in ten-person groups and get their pictures next to the dolphins with the help of a trainer.

SeaWorld said that the program resembles those at its San Diego and San Antonio parks, according to the Orlando Sentinel. 

The change will likely help the stomachs of dolphins who eat unnatural material dropped in their tanks by visitors, said Mark Palmer, associate director for the International Marine Mammal Project.

More distance between children and the animals will also help prevent bitings, such as the attack on Jillian Thomas, who was holding a tray of food, in 2012.

The then-eight-year-old Georgia girl suffered from three puncture wounds and her father, who captured the incident on video, said that she could have been pulled into the water.

Some animal rights activists have urged against humans having any ability to touch the dolphins, saying that it is also dangerous for the cetaceans.

A nine-year-old's hand was bitten in 2014 at the park's location in Texas. after the Blackfish documentary look at aggressive behavior in one of the chain's orcas who was involved in three deaths.

The park has had a run of bad publicity ever since Blackfish, a documentary that looked at aggressive behavior in one of the chain's orcas who was involved in three deaths.

CEO Jim Atchinson resigned at the end of last year amid slumping profits.

Nanuq, a 32-year-old Beluga whale who was on loan from Canada, died in Orlando last week from a fractured jaw.

He reportedly had an 'interaction' with two other whales at the park and got an infection from his injury.

Most of the creatures at the Florida attraction's Dolphin Cove are friendly, and come up to play with visitors while making small splashes. 

Some guests said they were more interested in petting the dolphins than giving them their supper. 

The San Antonio and San Diego parks charge $50 and $60 per person respectively for small group dolphin feeding experiences. 

The Orlando park's dolphin area is not currently open and will resume operations on March 2, according to News13. 

While dolphins are known for their playful behavior and permanently painted smiles, they are also known for their sheer physical power and sharp teeth which have led to attacks on humans.

Human feeding is linked behind many reported attacks though other incidents have been seen during moments of sexual aggression.

Federal officials say dolphins are of little threat to people in captive swim programs - in 1994 less than 1 out of 10,000 people injured - but those animals in the wild are far more spontaneous and unpredictable in their behavior.

In Louisiana a single wild dolphin was reported terrorizing residents in a waterside community in Slidell where it bit three people in June 2012.

In one incident a boater's hand was sliced open by the dolphin's teeth while he stuck his hand in the water to clean it. In another case a girl was dragged into the water by her ankle.

Other reports described the dolphin as head butting and chasing acquaintances.

Like many other incidents, officials in Louisiana said there were related reports of people feeding the dolphin and attempting to lure it out with food potentially leading to its association of all humans having food.
