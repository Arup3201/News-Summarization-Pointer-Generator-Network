A 68-year-old disabled veteran inserted sewing needles into packaged meat at an Illinois grocery store for more than a year 'just for the hell of it', the FBI said.

Ronald Avers faces up to 70 years in prison for allegedly tampering with everything from ground beef to steaks at Shop 'n Save in Belleville at least seven times from May last year.

Security footage allegedly showed the divorcee, who is hooked up to an oxygen tank, riding into the store on a motorized scooter and touching a range of meat products that he ultimately didn't buy.

Scene: Ronald Avers faces up to 70 years in prison for allegedly tampering with everything from ground beef to steaks at Shop 'n Save in Belleville, Illinois (pictured) at least seven times from May last year.

FBI special agents and Belleville police arrested Avers on Tuesday after grocery store employees recognized him from CCTV video.

Police found an open package of sewing needles in Avers' pickup truck, according to an affidavit filed by FBI Special Agent Daniel Cook with the criminal complaint.

Avers told cops he kept the needles on 
hand to mend pants he tore while camping.

He eventually admitted to inserting needles in the meat products, telling FBI investigators he concealed the needle in the holder of his portable oxygen tank.

''Every
 now and then I would stick one in a hamburger',' Cook quoted Avers as 
saying before the man expounded, "'Mostly hamburger, a couple of times I
 did it with a roast, maybe a pork chop every now and then'.'

Avers insisted he had no justification for such tampering, calling it a 'stupid idea', Cook wrote.

'Avers
 said during the interview two times he inserted sewing needles into 
packaged meat products, 'just for the hell of it',' the FBI agent wrote,
 adding that Avers continued: 'It was stupidity. I didn't want to hurt 
nobody.'

Six customers complained to Shop 'n Save 
that they found sewing needles in packaged meat from Mat last year, according to BND.com.

The latest incident occurred on July 12 when a needle was found in a package of pork steaks. One time, an employee found sewing needles
 in a package of pork chops.

SuperValu Inc., the Minnesota-based 
corporate parent of the Shop 'n Save chain, stressed that none of the 
cases resulted in serious injury, and that the alleged tampering was 
isolated to only the meat section of one store.

'With every customer that brought it to 
our attention, none reported needing medical attention as a result of 
the tampering,' Jeff Swanson, a SuperValu spokesman said.  'We have no 
reason to believe any tampering occurred outside of that one store.'

Online court records show that Avers has a history of traffic offenses but no previous criminal background.

Swanson said customers who bought fresh meat from the store before July 12 can get a refund or exchange.

Avers made a brief court appearance on Thursday on the seven tampering 
counts each punishable by up to 10 years in prison and $250,000 fine.

He was ordered jailed pending a scheduled detention hearing on Monday.

A message left Thursday with Avers' federal public defender was not immediately returned.
