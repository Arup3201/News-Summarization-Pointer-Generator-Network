'This definitely brightened my day': Sidelined skier Lindsey Vonn brought home a rescue dog after announcing she can't compete in next month's Sochi Olympics

Lindsey Vonn cheered herself up on Wednesday after announcing she'll be missing the Sochi Olympics by picking up a new four-legged friend.

The injury-plagued downhill ski champ and her high-profile lover Tiger Woods chose Leo, a 9-month-old boxer mix, because he has injuries just like hers.

'He has a bad knee, just like me,' a limping Vonn told reporters as she led the pup from a Jupiter, Florida shelter.

Vonn first saw the injured dog the day before Christmas Eve, according to WPBF.

At the time, her boyfriend Woods wanted a different dog.

But workers at Furry Friends in Jupiter said she came back annmouncing 'I won!' before adopting Leo.

Down in the dumps Vonn posted a photo of herself with the dog on Twitter Wednesday evening.

'Leo brightened my day,' she wrote. 'Has a bum knee bc a car hit him #bumkneebuddies #puppylove.'

Vonn is widely regarded as the most successful female skier of all time, but a February 2013 knee injury while skiing in Austria has since seriously sidetracked her career.

Until Tuesday, Vonn had remained upbeat nonetheless.

Less than two weeks after 
reconstructive right knee surgery in February 2013, Lindsey Vonn already
 was sounding a positive note, saying she was 'really looking forward to
 Sochi' and defending her Olympic downhill gold medal.

Along
 the way to the next Winter Games, though, Vonn began facing more 
setbacks. As she'd move past one, another would surface. In the end, it 
was too much, even for Vonn, the most accomplished U.S. ski racer in 
history. Expected to be one of the biggest stars at the upcoming Games, 
Vonn announced Tuesday — exactly one month before the opening ceremony —
 she won't be able to race in Russia.

In a Facebook posting, Vonn said she is 'devastated' to miss the Olympics, 'but the reality has sunk in that my knee is just too unstable to compete at this level.'

Like many in her risk-filled sport, Vonn has dealt with injuries often, particularly at major events. She withdrew midway through the 2011 world championships because of a concussion. She raced with a severely bruised shin at the last Olympics. She skipped a race at the 2009 worlds after slicing her thumb open on a champagne bottle. She hurt her knee in training and missed a pair of races at the 2007 worlds. She took a scary fall during training at the 2006 Olympics, then left the hospital to compete.

'She's come back. She'll be back,' Vonn's father, Alan Kildow, said in a telephone interview. 'You'll see a lot of Lindsey Vonn in the future.'

Vonn left the 2010 Vancouver Games with two medals: the first Olympic downhill gold for an American woman, and a bronze in the super-G. She is also a four-time overall World Cup champion, by far the most recognized name in Alpine skiing at the moment — and, as it happens, the girlfriend of Tiger Woods.

Add it all up, and she would have been the focus of plenty of media coverage in Sochi, certainly a main character in NBC's coverage for a U.S. audience.

'Lindsey gives you great promotional value, and she's an amazing athlete and an amazing story,' said Gary Zenkel, president of NBC Olympics. 'But there are amazing athletes that are going to be in Sochi, many of which we know, some of which we haven't identified yet.'

To those in the world of skiing, there's no doubt about the sport's most important athlete of late.

'Without Lindsey Vonn, the races are 
just not the same,' Canadian women's Alpine coach Hugues Ansermoz said 
last month. 'She just attracts so much interest. When Lindsey Vonn is 
here, there are more people coming to watch the race, there is more 
interest on TV, more journalists are interested. And her relationship 
with Tiger Woods makes even more people interested.'

But
 Vonn has rarely been present on the elite skiing circuit the past 12 
months. She tore two ligaments in her right knee and broke a bone in 
that leg during a high-speed crash at the world championships last 
February.

As Vonn 
neared a return, she re-tore her surgically repaired ACL in a crash 
during training in November. After finishing 40th, 11th and fifth in a 
trio of World Cup races at Lake Louise, Alberta, in early December, Vonn
 sprained her MCL during a downhill at Val d'Isere, France, two weeks 
later.

'I did everything I possibly could to somehow get strong enough to overcome having no ACL,' Vonn said Tuesday via Facebook.
