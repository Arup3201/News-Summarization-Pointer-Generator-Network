Condensation mists up the windows, and neon lights bounce off the mildewy walls, but these small discos are still a magnet for young people living in the rural villages of Lithuania.

The tiny, rundown and often near-empty nightclubs have been documented by Seattle photographer Andrew Miksys, who has traveled through the former Soviet Union country in search of rural nightlife for the past ten years.

'It seemed like a perfect backdrop to make a series of photographs about young people in Lithuania, a crumbling past and the uncertain future of a new generation together in one room,' he said.

Miksys said that he found a young generation ready to ignore the hardships of a struggling economy, and 'just get drunk, make out, dance and sometimes fight'.

Gaining access to the tightly knit communities where the village discos are held was often tricky and dangerous for a stranger.

'My anxiety was often quite intense when I got in my car and left the familiar lights of Vilnius searching for discos on mostly empty back roads,' Miksys told Landscape Stories. 

'But the prospect of discovering a disco somewhere in the dark with colored lights pouring out the windows and pulsating music pushed me forward.'

The photographer often found remnants of Lithuania's Communist past, with broken paintings of Lenin, gas masks and posters for Soviet films dumped in the back of the halls.

'I was quite fascinated by all this debris of a dead empire,' Miksys said. He was voted one of the top 30 emerging photos to watch by Photo District News in 2002.

Lithuania was under Communist rule from 1944 until the fall of the Soviet Union in 1990. During this period its people clung to their culture and Pagan roots to maintain a sense of identity.

The reach of Communist influence during the Soviet years would have had an impact on the clubs.

Several bands were banned for being ideologically harmful, including the Village People, who were considered 'violent', Tina Turner and Donna Summer were seen as being too erotic, and Julio Iglesias, who was barred from playlists for being 'neo-fascist', according to the Scotsman.

Miksys said however, that the spark of life in the young people gathering to drink and meet reminded him of the country's pagan past, according to Flavorwire.

The photographer, who splits his time between Seattle and Vilnius in Lithuania, said that for solstice the country's pagans would run naked through the forests, dancing and jumping over fires, and having sex in the bushes. 

Although many young Lithuanians move to cities, or try to find work abroad, the summer solstice is still a festival that brings them back together.

During the Pagan celebration, celebrated on June 21 this year, the near-deserted villages become overflowing with revelers.

'While it’s assumed that discos are a 
product of urban culture, it seems to me that these pagan traditions 
from the forest could have been the first discos,' he said.

The American-Lithuanian's heritage 
helped him gain access to the rural communities, who were often wary as 
to why he wanted to photograph them.

'My broken, heavily accented 
Lithuanian certainly gave me away. In truth, it was probably my outsider
 status that made me less threatening and kept me safe,' he said.

Miksys experiences of Lithuanian nightclubs form a book, Disko, which is due be published in September.
