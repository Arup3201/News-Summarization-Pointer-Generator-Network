A teenager who was regularly taunted by strangers on the street about her size has dropped five dress sizes and as many stone in just one year.

Laura Frankham, 19, suffered from self-esteem issues and found herself comfort eating, leaving her at a size 20 and weighing 16 stone at her heaviest.

The nursery worker's binge eating did not go unnoticed as Laura would often receive abuse from both friends and strangers because of her weight.

Laura Frankham dropped five stone in one year after years of being taunted about her size

Laura, from Burnley, said that it got to the stage where she became so miserable with her weight that she hid herself away.

'I was really self conscious and had little confidence. I started to become a recluse - I'd get invited to parties but I wouldn't go because I was so unhappy with my weight,' she said.

As Laura became more uncomfortable in her own body her emotional eating only worsened. 

Laura decided to take on the cabbage soup diet seeing her lose half a stone in her first week of trying it

'I lived on a diet of crisps, chocolate and other sugary snacks. 

'Sometimes I ate two dinners a night - I would eat at my friend's house and then go home and eat another dinner which my mum had made.

'I used to eat huge portions of food packed with carbs and cheese - I loved to eat the fat off meat as well - that was a big thing for me.'

'It got really out of control.' 

Laura, said that it was when she couldn't walk down the street without being taunted that she realised she needed to trim down.

'People at school would call me fatty, fat b****, fat f***. When strangers in the streets would join in, that's when I realised I needed to lose weight.' 

Laura kickstarted her weight loss in autumn of 2012 by braving the cabbage soup diet - an eating regime which requires followers to eat nothing but cabbage soup for a week.

The diet, which is designed to help shed fat fast, saw Laura lose half a stone in her first week of battling the bulge. 

She steadily lost up to 4lbs a week, helped by regular sessions on her Wii Fit system.

'I stopped eating chocolate, crisps and potatoes for quite a while and started to eat veg and healthy light meat,' said the 19-year-old.

By September 2013 Laura had dropped a five stone. 

She currently weighs 10st 8lb - she and no longer plagued by her low self-esteem.

'I feel so much happier now that I've lost the weight - I'm a lot more confident and I enjoy a much healthier social life.

'I plan to lose a little bit more weight - but not too much.'
