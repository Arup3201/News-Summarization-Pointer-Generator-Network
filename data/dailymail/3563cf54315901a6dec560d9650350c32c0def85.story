The Government moved a small step closer to returning Lloyds Banking Group to private ownership today as it sold 1 per cent of shares, raising £500million.

Chancellor George Osborne said he was 'delighted' at further progress being made to claw back taxpayers' money pumped into the bank at the height of the financial crisis. 

The announcement comes ahead of a crucial week for the group, which is expected to announce in its results on Friday that it will resume payments of dividends to shareholders for the first time since falling foul of the financial crisis in 2007. 

Going private? The government has reduced its stake in Lloyds Banking Group to 23.9 per cent today

This morning, shares in Lloyds are up by 0.68p or 0.87 per cent to 78.66p. Today's share sale by the government reduces its stake from 24.9 per cent to 23.9 per cent.

During the financial crisis, UK taxpayers pumped £20billion into the bank, giving the government a 41 per cent shareholding. The Coalition Government wants to aim to reduce its stake in the bank before May's election as a prelude to returning it full privatisation.

By selling the 1 per cent stake in the group - which includes Halifax and Bank of Scotland as well as other financial brands such as Scottish Widows - the government said it raised £500million. 

The shares were sold as UK Financial Investments, which manages the government's stakes in bailed out banks, hired Morgan Stanley In December to sell Lloyds' shares on the stock market through a 'pre-arranged trading plan'.

The sales since made by Morgan Stanley, all at a price above the 73.6p average price that the government paid,  take the total amount raised by the government so far from selling down its stake in Lloyds to just under £8 billion. 

Chancellor George Osborne said: 'I am delighted to announce today that the trading plan I launched in December has raised a further £500 million for the taxpayer so far. 

'This is further progress in returning Lloyds Banking Group to private ownership, reducing our national debt and getting taxpayers' money back'.

Chancellor George Osborne said he was 'delighted' at further progress being made to claw back taxpayers' money pumped into the bank at the height of the financial crisis

A pre-election sale of shares in Lloyds to ordinary members of the public was ruled out last year by Chancellor George Osborne.

The Government has chosen to sell the stock over time 'in an orderly and measured way' rather than through large tranches as has been done previously.

It said in December that it hoped to sell off a stake of up to 5 per cent in Lloyds over the following six months of 2015 in order to raise about £3billion.

In its latest set of results on Friday, Lloyds is expected to announce that it will start to pay a dividend to shareholders for the first time since its collapse into state-ownership. 

The bank is expected to report annual pre-tax profits of around £2billion, up from £415million a year earlier, after putting aside another £600million to compensate customers mis-sold payment protection insurance.

In the money: Lloyds boss Antonio Horta-Osorio is set to receive a £7million windfall for hitting targets set in 2012

But, the bank's results run the risk of being overshadowed by a £7million payment to chief executive Antonio Horta-Osorio for hitting targets set out in March 2012. 

The shares bonus – almost 50 times David Cameron's £142,500 salary – stems from a performance-related award given to Mr Horta-Osorio shortly after he took the helm in 2011, which was signed off by the Treasury.

It comes on top of a pay package worth up to £4million, putting the 51-year-old Portuguese chief on course to rake in £11million. 

Investec Securities analyst Ian Gordon said in a note: 'In December 2014, when UKFI announced its plan to 'dribble' shares into the market through H1 2015, it was subject to considerable criticism, with many commentators arguing that Lloyds shares were now effectively 'dead money'.

'Today UKFI announces that it has already sold a further c.1 per cent stake for c.£500m over the past 7 weeks, reducing its residual holding to 23.9%. During this period Lloyds has been the 2nd best performing FTSE100 bank (behind Barclays (Buy)), offering UKFI a strong sense of vindication? BUY.'

Looking ahead to Lloyds full year 2014 results on Friday, Mr Gordon said he expected the 'restoration of a 'token' 1p dividend, with scope for very material growth in the pay-out through 2015-17'.

While Lloyds is set to report a boost to profits on Friday, HSBC has reported a 17 per cent drop in annual pre-tax profits to £12.1billion this morning. Shares in HSBC are down 31.75p or 5.25 per cent to 573.45p this morning.
