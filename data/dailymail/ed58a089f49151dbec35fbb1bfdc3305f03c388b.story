An eagle-eyed fan has snapped a selfie with Michelle and Sasha Obama as they attended a Beyonce and Jay-Z concert in Chicago last night.

Yesenia Herrera was standing in front of the first family at Soldier Field when she whipped out her cell phone and took a selfie - capturing Mrs Obama and her youngest daughter in the background.

Michelle, who was in the city to hold a Democrat fundraiser, and 13-year-old Sasha were also at the concert with Sasha's big sister, Malia, 16.

Herrera, a model from Chicago, then shared the image to Instagram - no doubt to the chagrin of Michelle Obama, who has previously complained about images of her daughters being shared.

The first lady had called a photo agency earlier this month after it shared pictures of Malia walking into a restaurant, arguing that her girls can only be photographed if they're with the president.

Mrs Obama had arrived in Chicago earlier on Thursday to help rake in money for Democrats at a fundraiser at the Waldorf Astoria, CBS2 reported. It was the first time she had visited her home town in a year.

She spoke before more than 100 people at the hotel and urged attendees to help support the mid-term elections.

'We need you to write the biggest, fattest check that you can possibly write,' she said in a 20-minute address, according to a transcript of her remarks provided by the White House.

Donations ranged from $500 to $20,000 each, according to CBS2.

'She had a message of hope,'Â 
supporter Linda Havlin told ABC7. 'That with the right sense of investment 
and opportunity, children can thrive - and should thrive and deserve to 
thrive.'

After the fundraiser, Mrs Obama went to New Asian cuisine restaurant Sunda in River North where she posed for a snap with the owner, Billy Dec.

Afterwards she headed to the concert with her girls and returned to their home in Kenwood around midnight. They were due to fly back to Washington, D.C. around noon on Friday, CBS2 reported.

Despite mingling around the crowd, the Obamas are good friends with Beyonce and her husband.

In an interview with People magazine in December, Michelle Obama revealed that her daughters are big fans of her music.

'They love Jay Z. They love Beyonce. Sasha is still a One Direction fan, although I think Malia has become a little less into boy bands,' Mrs Obama said in a joint interview for People Magazine.

'They've gotten to know Beyonce, and she has always been very sweet to them,' Mr Obama added

In January, Beyonce performed for Michelle Obama's 50th birthday party at the White House. She performed hits, including Single Ladies, and was joined by Stevie Wonder in front of 300 guests.
