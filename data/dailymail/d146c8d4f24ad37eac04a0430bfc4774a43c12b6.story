A 45-year-old Florida woman faces prison time for allegedly making a string of bogus 911 calls regarding her husband's misbehavior.

Sheri Lynn Hunt from Fort Walton Beach is accused of calling emergency services in the early hours of November 18 to report that her husband had locked himself in a bedroom.

However, when police responded to the incident at 3.22am, Hunt reportedly changed her story and said she needed help finding a check.

Officers instructed her not to call 911 for non-emergencies.

According to the arrest report obtained by MailOnline, Hunt started arguing and stated that it was an emergency.

In the end she backed down and said  would not repeat the offense.

Police warned her she would be arrested if he did it again and made sure she had a non-emergency contact for the local police department.

But more than an hour later at 4.55am, Hunt called again to report that her husband had stolen $85 from her, according to the report.

When troopers arrived, Hunt's husband said he hadn't taken money from her and that he'd told her not to call 911 again.  

She was arrested and charged with misuse of 911. Fort Walton Beach Police officers note that Hunt is known for habitually calling in with false reports and has been charged for the same crime previously.

Her next court date is scheduled for December 9.

The offense is punishable by up to a year in jail or a $1,000 fine.
