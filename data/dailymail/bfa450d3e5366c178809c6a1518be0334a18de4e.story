Zenit St Petersburg are launching a bid to prise unsettled Thomas Vermaelen away from Arsenal.

Arsene Wenger can ill afford to let anyone go just now with a mounting injury crisis but the 28-year-old Vermaelen is eager to play more games with a place in Belgium's World Cup squad at stake.

His experience should be enough to ensure selection by Marc Wilmots but Vermaelen is also conscious of being sharp enough to perform at his best for his country in Brazil where Belgium are among the dark horses for a semi final place.

He is settled in London but 11 games in all competitions this season is not enough.

There are plenty of clubs who have been keen to take him, such as Napoli, but have so far failed with Wenger stressing his importance to the cause and Vermaelen wary of making the wrong move.

Ambitious Zenit have Belgian internationals Nicolas Lombaerts and Axel Witsel already in their line-up, they have the cash too to make a deal attractive to all parties but the timing may not be right for Arsenal.

Pellegrini happy to wait for Mangala and Fernando as Moyes looks elsewhereManchester City may have a clearer run than they anticipated in their pursuit of Porto defender Eliaquim Mangala this summer.

Manchester
 United manager David Moyes has long been linked with the 22-year-old 
but it is understood has now cooled his interest.

Moyes has watched the Frenchman 
personally and is still looking around in the hope he or his scouts spot
 something better to replace Rio Ferdiand and Nemanja Vidic. City's main
 competition may now come from Paris St Germain and Monaco.

Moyes
 also had the opportunity to sign Porto midfielder Fernando, who again 
is expected to move to City on a free in the summer, but declined.

Pardew hoping wanted man Cisse stays put

Newcastle manager Alan Pardew will be hoping the club resists offers for Papiss Cisse on Monday.

The Senegal striker is the subject of offers from Besiktas and Trabzonspor with the Turkish window due to close at 5pm.

Time is against them but an £8million
 offer will make life even more difficult for Pardew as he tries to lift
 his club following Yohan Cabaye's sale and Saturday's derby defeat.

Even
 surviving today may not put an end to the interest as Russian clubs are
 also keen on Cisse. They have until the end of this month before their 
window closes.

Spurs eye wing wizards Thauvin and Konoplyanka

The windows of opportunity remain open in Eastern Europe and Scandinavia. Here's the closing times:

Brazil - 11pm, March 31; Bulgaria - Midnight, February 28; China - February 28; Norway - March 31; Poland - February 28; Russia - February 27; Serbia - February 14; Sweden - March 31; Switzerland - Feb 17; Ukraine - March 1; USA - April 15.

Tottenham showed some late interest in Marseille's attacking midfielder Florian Thauvin last week.

A return to France for Etienne Capoue was mooted as part of the deal but Tottenham chairman Daniel Levy is keen to see how Capoue develops hence his resistance to Napoli's efforts to sign him - plus the obvious factor that he did not want to sell for a loss so soon after purchasing.

Ongoing Chelsea and Newcastle target Thauvin has not been too consistent of late and his performance against Monaco recently drew criticism from Frank Lebouef as reported by Sportsmail.

Tottenham are considering various 
summer targets and plan to resume talks over Ukraine winger Yevhen 
Konoplyanka later this month. Dnipro pulled the plug on his proposed 
£15m move to Liverpool and Tottenham hope to capitalise.

Talking
 of Liverpool's efforts to sign Konoplyanka, Dnipro chief executive 
Andriy Rusol said: 'The president could not keep the midfielder because 
his contract spelled out the specific amount of compensation.

'In fact, the British did not have time to complete the transaction. Our club could not sign the documents until our account received the money. And they did not receive anything before the deadline.

'Yevhen is a very strong person he knows his move to a big club is only a matter of time.'

Blades youngster De Girolamo under the microscope

Chelsea,Tottenham and Arsenal will have scouts posted at tomorrow night's FA Cup replay between Fulham and Sheffield United.

They are hoping to see if Diego de Girolamo gets on from the bench for Sheffield United.

The 18-year-old is continuing to build up game time following ten months out with ligament damage and hopes to get a chance to test himself against Premier League defenders and play a part in a potential cup shock for Nigel Clough's men.

Birmingham youngster Brown attracts City and Liverpool

Manchester City and Liverpool are continuing to keep abreast of developments with Birmingham starlet Reece Brown.

The 17-year-old signed professional forms at St Andrews last month and is progressing nicely having broken into the first team this season.

Liverpool and City are not alone in the big clubs to have taken an interest but their financial clout may persuade cash-strapped Birmingham to sell should they follow up with an offer. City have a good rapport with Birmingham having loaned some of their fringe squad players to St Andrews.

Championship duo consider Wednesday striker Lavery

Watford and Reading were among the clubs represented at Hillsborough on Saturday for Sheffield Wednesday's 1-0 win over Barnsley.

Although Chris Maguire scored the winning goal, they went along to see Wednesday striker Caolan Lavery come on for the last 20 minutes. The 21-year-old Northern Ireland international has been on loan at Plymouth where he grabbed three goals in four starts and came back to score twice in Wednesday's 6-0 demolition of Leeds.

Celtic have also shown an interest in Canadian-born Lavery and they will be heartened as his current contract runs out in the summer.

Pitroipa explains failed Stoke move

Rennes winger Jonathan Pitroipa has blamed the collapse of his deadline-day loan move to Stoke City on middle men who got involved on behalf of the French club.

The Burkina Faso international was at the Britannia Stadium on Friday only to see the deal beaten by the clock.

He told L'Equipe: 'Contrary to what has been said, it was not due to my agent that I didn't join Stoke, but due to intermediaries appointed by Rennes on that case.'

Cellino eyes Serie A talent for Leeds

Leeds' prospective owner Massimo Cellino was busy putting out feelers for potential signings at the end of last week. Cellino is eager to bring in four new players if he gets the all-clear to buy the Elland Road club.

Cagliari's Brazilian left-back Danilo Avelar, 24, plus playmaker Andrea Tabanelli, 24, who is on loan at Cagliari from Cesena, striker Daniele Cacia, 30, at Verona and 6ft 5ins striker Ferdinando Sforzini, 29, at Pescara were among names on list of potential recruits.

Foxes consider Schmeichel replacement

Leicester City watched Marco Bizot at the weekend. The 6ft 5ins former Holland U21 goalkeeper was unable to prevent Groningen going down 2-0 away to Alkmaar but continues to improve a growing reputation.

Holland are considering taking him to the World Cup and Leicester, who were joined by scouts from Bayer Leverkusen, Hertha Berlin and Borussia Monchengladbach, have an eye on taking him before his price gets too high.

Safe hands: Leicester are keen on a deal for Holland U21 keeper Marco Bizot

They will offer Kasper Schmeichel a new contract but are aware of interest from AC Milan which may prove difficult to resist for the Dane and need a replacement.Neill on verge of Rovers deal

Lucas Neill may get his wish of a return to Blackburn Rovers this week.

The 35-year-old Australian has been training at the Championship club and hopes the departure of Scott Dann to Crystal Palace on deadline day will help clear the club to give him a short term deal.

Neill has had nine clubs in a varied career and spent six years at Blackburn previously between 2001 and 2007.

Meanwhile, Malmo FF are expected to snap up free agent Markus Rosenberg after he was released from West Bromwich Albion.
