Bullied: Amanda Cummings was picked on at school, according to her family

Claims that the Staten Island teenage girl who jumped in front of a bus to kill herself did so due to bullying are now being rebuffed by police.

Amanda Cummings, 15, died over the holidays, and while some friends and family were certain that she was bullied, official investigators have ruled that out as the main factor in her suicide.

Instead it is now thought that her tendancy to fall hard for boys, her history of depression, and an increase on her drinking and smoking, all converged to a tragic tipping point.

'No one had any previous signs of her being bullied,' a source close to the case told The New York Post.

Though bullying may not have been a contributing factor to her suicidal mental state, it certainly reared its' ugly head after her death, as commentators made scathing jokes on a Facebook memorial page.

One of the harshest messages, from Stephen Ephrem Green, played on her last name, saying: 'Bus was cummin’ Bitch was watchin’ Oh hurry Amanda Your bus cummin.'

On December 27 at about 7:30pm, witnesses saw Amanda jump in front of an oncoming city bus. Hours before, she had posted to Facebook: '... Nd ill die tomight crying over you..'

While the national problem of bullying- and the cruel Facebook postings post-mortum- may have had investigators initially looking into the tormentings of teenagers, other evidence points to personal problems as the biggest cause.

She had been hospitalized in 2009 for cutting herself, but the doctor's notes make no mention of bullying ever being an issue.

Her death came weeks after revealing posts appeared on her public Facebook page, in which she talked about 'feeling depressed' and asks 'what did I do to deserve this?'

In one disturbing post on December 1 she said: 'I'll go kill myself'.

On December 6, in what appears to be a cry for help, Amanda posted on her Facebook: 'When i say im ok i want that one person t look me in the eye, hug me & say no ur not'

Three days earlier, the natural blonde who recently dyed her hair black, said: 'Worst sat nite ever i cnt believe this is happening what did i do to deserve this.'

She later talks about; 'mad people are turning against me :'( im spending this sat nite alone in my room crying'.

Amanda herself did not even cite bullying in her extensive four-page suicide note. Instead, she sounded like a sad and love-lorn girl who had just broken up with a one-time flame.

In the note, she confessed to being the reason behind her most recent romantic failing, saying that she was sorry for coming between her crush, Devon Rodriguez, and his suspected love interest Rebecca Natali.

She finished the letter with the haunting words: 'I don't deserve to live!'
