It is not only on the football pitch where Manchester United have slipped. The annual Football Money League by Deloitte, published on Thursday, sees Bayern Munich overtake the Premier League champions in earning power too.

United actually made more money in 2012/13 than in the previous season but dropped from third to fourth because of the remarkable gains made by the German treble-winners. United fell out of the top three for the first time in the publication’s 17-year history.

They are expected to rise next year, despite their struggles on the pitch, because of the new Premier League broadcast rights.

Drop: Man United slipped out of the top three of the Football Money League for the first time in the publication's 17-year history

Celebrations: Bayern Munich, Champions League winners in 2013, jumped to third in the football rich list

Rich list: The annual Football Money League by Deloitte sees Real Madrid top the overall standings

The money table has been compiled by Deloitte since 1997, and for the first eight years United were the biggest-earning club in the world only to be overtaken by first Real Madrid, then Barcelona and now Bayern.

United's fall will concern the club's shareholders the most, especially since shares on the New York stock exchange are down just above the 15-dollar mark from an annual high of more than 19 dollars.

Real Madrid stretched their lead at the top, turning over £444.7million (€518.9m) last season, compared to second-place Barcelona’s £413.6m (€482.6m). Bayern made £369.6m (€431.2m), just ahead of United’s £363.2m (€423.8m).

Manchester City marked their emergence onto the global scene by beating domestic rivals Chelsea and Arsenal for the first time, largely thanks to a growth in commercial revenues. 

City came sixth overall with £271m (€316.2m), Chelsea seventh with £260m (€303.4m) and Arsenal £243.6m (€284.3m).

City’s revenues rose by just under £40m and it appears as though they will scrape through UEFA’s Financial Fair Play test. Official financial figures for 2012/13 are yet to be released, but that increase should be enough to meet the requirements and avoid the threat of a Champions League ban.

Flying high: Arsenal currently top the Premier League table but are eighth in Deloitte's Money League

  4. Manchester United £363.2m

  6. Manchester City £271m

  7. Chelsea £260m

  8. Arsenal £243.6m

12. Liverpool £206m

14. Tottenham £147.4m

25. Newcastle United £91.5m

29. West Ham United £85.7m

Questions over matchday income were aired after figures showed it has doubled in one year – from around £20m to £39.6m. 

Ed Thompson, the FFP commentator and analyst, said: ‘It could be that they have taken out a mortgage against one year’s advance match day income. It is certainly a baffling figure.’

The Deloitte report said: ‘The overall revenue increase is driven largely by a growth in commercial revenue as the club expand into new markets and seek to develop its brand internationally. The agreement with Etihad Airways is the centre piece of the club’s commercial success.’

Meanwhile, the Money League also illustrates how 
clubs which are taken over by super-rich owners can swiftly see huge 
increases in revenue. In 2009, Manchester City and PSG were 20th and 
21st in the table but have seen significant growth, notably in terms of 
commercial income.

Paris Saint-Germain rocketed into the top five after a huge 81 per cent increase on turnover to £341.8m (€398.8), partly down to the arrival of David Beckham.

The
 report said: ‘Since Qatar Sports Investments acquired a controlling 
stake in the club in June 2011, PSG’s revenue has almost quadrupled. The
 club has rapidly expanded its commercial portfolio over the last two 
seasons, whilst the high-profile signing of David Beckham in the second 
half of the 2012/13 season only served to enhance the club’s worldwide 
profile.’

Like Man City, the French champions also benefited from a major sponsorship deal related to the club's owners.

PSG's Qatar Tourism Authority sponsorhsip, which will net the French club £160m annually until 2016, has eclipsed City's £400m-plus Etihad deal which is over 10 years.

All such related sponsorship deals will be studied by UEFA as part of the European governing body's financial fair play rules to ensure they are of 'fair market value'.

Liverpool have dropped out of the top 10 for the first time since 1999 - the Reds are in 12th spot with revenue of £206m (€240.6m)  behind Juventus, AC Milan and Borussia Dortmund, while Tottenham are in 14th place with earnings of £147.4m (€172m).
