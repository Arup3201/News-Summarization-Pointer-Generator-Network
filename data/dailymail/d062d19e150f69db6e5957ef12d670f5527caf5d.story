An Ohio woman who had her children help her shoplift from a Wal-Mart has been ordered to write them a letter explaining what she did and why it was wrong.

Police in Logan in southeastern Ohio say Hallie Thomas and her two daughters took merchandise from a Wal-Mart last February and March.

The Logan Daily News reports the 36-year-old Thomas pleaded guilty on Tuesday to one count of petty theft and one count of child endangering.

Hocking County Municipal Court Judge Fred Moses ordered Thomas to write the letter explaining why what she did was wrong and said he hoped she learned from her experience.

The judge also sentenced her to 10 days in jail, fined her and ordered her to stay away from Wal-Mart.

Defense attorney Don Kline said Thomas accepted responsibility and was remorseful.

Thomas and her daughters were caught shoplifting on video on February 17.

Surveillance revealed that Thomas’ daughters entered Walmart with their mother wearing dark-colored coats, and left wearing pink coats and had hidden stolen items under their coats, reports The Logan Daily.

Hocking County Municipal Court Judge Fred Moses was most troubled by the fact that Logan included her daughters in the crime.

'I hope you learn from this,' stated Moses.

'You really need help. While in the community corrections program, make sure you learn from this and that you cannot involve your children.'
