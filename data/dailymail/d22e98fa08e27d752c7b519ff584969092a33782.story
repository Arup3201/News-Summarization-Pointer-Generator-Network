Into the wild... Dustin Self, 19, who is believed missing on Steens Mountain in the remote and rugged country of south-eastern Oregon

An Oklahoma teenager who was inspired to live off the land by the movie 'Into the Wild' is the target of a search effort in remote, rugged country in southeastern Oregon.

Dustin Self, 19, left suburban Oklahoma City a month ago after becoming interested in churches practicing a South 
American religion that uses a hallucinogenic tea as a sacrament.

The Harney County sheriff’s office says a search began on Tuesday for Dustin on the north end of Steens Mountain after a rancher found his truck had slid off a backcountry road. 

Searchers on ATVs saw no tracks, but 
checked out remote cabins and worked their way up the mountain, with no 
sign of him before heavy snow and high winds curtailed their efforts, 
said Deputy Missy Ousley.

Authorities hoped for a break in the weather so they could send up a plane to look for him.

'We did everything we could to try to talk him out of it,' said his mother, Tammy Self.

'He was leaving, no matter what.'

The
teen was well-prepared with gear he bought just before leaving, but had
little experience of life in the wild beyond family camping trips, his 
parents said.

'He is not a survivalist,' said his father, Victor Self, a manager at a box plant in Oklahoma City. 'He is a very urban child.'

His parents last heard from him March
15, when he called from the parking lot of a motel in northern Nevada 
where he was spending the night in the cab of his pickup. 

The
next day, Dustin called his girlfriend in Austin, Texas, to say he was 
lost after his GPS had sent him onto a road along the east side of 
Steens Mountain in the high desert of southeastern Oregon.

Ousley
said a storekeeper in Fields recalled him asking for directions to 
Lakeview, which would have taken him a different direction than where 
his truck was found.

A
religious young man raised in a non-denominational Protestant church, 
Dustin had been searching for meaning in his life, his mother said.

He
read books like Human Race: Get Off Your Knees, by David Icke, a 
former British sports reporter whose books about what he believes is 
really controlling life on earth are admired by conspiracy theorists.

Inspiration: Dustin Self, 19, was inspired by 
the 2007 biographical film Into the Wild, starring Emile Hirsch, pictured, about the travels of
the late Christopher McCandless in the Alaskan wilderness

The last movie Dustin watched was 
Into The Wild about a young man who gives up his worldly goods to live 
in the Alaskan wilderness.

A clean-cut bodybuilder in high school, he had lately grown his hair long and wore a bandanna around his head.

'I think he got a lot off the Internet,' his mother said.

Tammy Self said her son is a vegetarian, with no desire to kill animals to eat.

'He thought he was going to eat berries,' she said.  'We tried to tell him, berries don't grow in wintertime.'

His father called the Harney County 
Sheriff's Office on March 17, but a search along the route from Fields 
to Lakeview turned up nothing.

He also filed a missing person report with his local police.

Then on Monday, Dustin's truck was found.

His backpack and camping gear were gone, but the keys, his computer, his GPS and some of his supply of protein bars and other food had been left behind.

'We're worried sick,' said his father. 'I just hope he's alive.'
