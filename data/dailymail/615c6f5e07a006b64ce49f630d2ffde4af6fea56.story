Barcelona fans travelling to the match on the tram were given helpful information in Spanish — voiced by none other than City’s Argentinian full back Pablo Zabaleta.

Zabaleta used to play for the Spanish city’s second team Espanyol, where he befriended and socialised with the young Lionel Messi.

Luis's Ground Zero  

Ideally, Luis Suarez would have chosen a stadium other than the Etihad at which to make his return to playing in England. 

The Uruguayan appeared twice for Liverpool at City’s ground last season, failed to score in either game and picked up a booking. He certainly put that right.

Friends reunited 

Few sets of players know each other better than these two. Five played together for Argentina in the World Cup final — Martin Demichelis, Sergio Aguero, Pablo Zabaleta, Lionel Messi and Javier Mascherano. 

Neymar, Fernandinho and Dani Alves are Brazil team-mates, as are David Silva, Jesus Navas, Sergio Busquets, Xavi and Andres Iniesta with Spain.

James hits the big time 

Manchester City will hope the inclusion of James Milner in the starting XI will be a sweetener for the England player, who is out of contract in the summer. 

Milner is worried about not playing enough big games this season but here he was for the biggest so far, ahead of Fernandinho and new £28million striker Wilfried Bony, with Yaya Toure suspended.
