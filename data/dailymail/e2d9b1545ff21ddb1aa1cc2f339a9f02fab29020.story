Former Liverpool goalkeeper Jerzy Dudek has revealed he did not realise he had become a Champions League winner after saving Andriy Shevchenko's penalty.

Liverpool won their fifth European title in 2005 by defeating AC Milan on penalties after pulling back a three-goal deficit.

However Dudek, who saved Shevchenko's after Vladimir Smicer scored what turned out to be the winning penalty, admitted he was oblivious to the importance of saving the Ukrainian striker's effort.

Speaking to Liverpool's official website, Dudek said: 'When Vladi scored I didn't realise if Shevchenko didn't score we had won. I just had my focus and desire to try and stop every penalty.

'I saw him walking up and saw the fear in his eyes. I managed to save it and I then saw Jamie and the other players running towards me and I realised it was finished... it was a beautiful moment.

'Everyone came to me, the kit men, the physios and it was fantastic. There was no one single hero, we were all heroes to come back from 3-0 down and to win on penalties was something special.'
