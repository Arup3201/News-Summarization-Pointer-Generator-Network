A devoted animal lover hopes to raise £3,000 for an operation to help her dog  who suffered horrific abuse by his previous owners.

Tracey Toft and her partner Jonathan Smith, from Whitwood, West Yorkshire, rescued Harvey the Jack Russell and Patterdale cross breed last year.

The two year-old dog had been  tied up and burned by his former owners, leaving him with severe scalds to his face and a broken leg. He also has a serious ear infection which urgently requires a £3,000 operation to remove his ear canal.

Harvey had been abused and neglected by his former owners, leaving him with severe scalds to his face, a broken leg and a serious ear infection

Tracey, 29, said: 'Jonathan agreed to having a dog if I found one that was free. I saw Harvey advertised as free to a good home.

'His previous owners said he suffered burns on a radiator but when we took him to the vets they said it was clear he'd been abused.'

The couple's campaign has already raised £600 towards the surgery and they are planning on holding a dog show on Saturday to help with the drive.

Now with new owners Tracey Toft and her partner Jonathan Smith, the two year-old Jack Russell and Patterdale cross breed is doing well and is on the road to recovery

Harvey has even qualified for the final of Scruffs Family Crossbreed Dog of the Year at the Crufts contest in March

'It's so heartwarming that everybody is coming together for a dog they have never even met," added Tracey. 'I think it's because people are passionate about animals and Harvey had no defence to the abuse he suffered.

'The operation is not a life-saving one but his ear causes him a lot of trouble and he cries if you touch it.'

Harvey has also qualified for the final of Scruffs Family Crossbreed Dog of the Year at the Crufts contest in March.
