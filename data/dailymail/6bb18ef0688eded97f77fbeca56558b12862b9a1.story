Shocking footage has revealed the moment care home staff were secretly filmed calling an 84-year-old great-grandmother with dementia a 'witch'.

Her daughter Maddy Jobson, 50, turned sleuth and hid the camera in a clock at the Keldgate Manor Residential Home, in Beverley, East Yorkshire, after she spotted her mother had bedsores.

Footage of the incident shows Alzheimer's sufferer Freda Jobson being degraded by the staff, who ask her if she is a witch, whether she has ever practiced black magic and mimic her groaning noises caused by dementia.

As Mrs Jobson lies in bed, care home workers (pictured) were heard to ask her if she was a 'witch' and also mimicked the groaning sounds she was making, which were caused by her dementia

They can also be heard swearing in front of her and are alleged to have removed a bandage used to cover a bedsore on her elbow and wrap it around her head while laughing.

Ms Jobson said: 'I am disgusted and sickened. I haven't slept a wink since I saw the footage.

'What if their actions had caused her heart to stop? Would we have just thought mother died peacefully in her sleep? It does not even bear thinking about.

'There's a sign on the door of the home that states, "Dignity, Respect and Care". But where was the dignity, respect and care for my 84-year-old mother?

'Our family put its trust in those who are supposed to be professional carers. All we wanted was end-of-life dignity and care for my mother.'

Humberside Police, the Care Quality Commission and the East Riding of Yorkshire Safeguarding Adults are carrying out a joint investigation.

In the footage, three female staff members are seen leaning over Mrs Jobson's bed and mimicking the noise she makes and laughing.

One of the women is heard to say, 'Don't she look like a gypsy witch?' She then adds: 'I bet you are into black magic. Are you a witch? Are you a witch?'

Mrs Jobson, whose late husband George was a Freeman of Beverley, worked nightshifts at care homes in the town, including Figham House and Molescroft.

Her care is funded by East Riding Council.

Shortly after arriving at the home in 2010, Mrs Jobson began suffering from bedsores, which are caused by prolonged pressure to the skin.

Her daughter, who works at Educare, a nursery in Mill Lane, Beverley, had watched a programme about spy cameras used in homes.

She said: 'I thought: Why haven't I done that? I wanted to know my mother was being properly looked after. I thought it would put my mind at rest.'

'We watched the footage on Tuesday on my laptop,' she said. 'I was livid when I saw it and I went straight round to the home and demanded to see a senior member of staff.'

Ms Jobson says she confronted Paul Raper, director of the home, and his wife Jane. His mother, Cecilia Raper, owns the facility.

'I exploded,' said Ms Jobson. 'How long has this been going on for?'

Management at the home declined to comment.

Lynsey Howes, of Hamer's Solicitors, which is acting on behalf of Keldgate Manor, said: 'The home is co-operating with external agencies investigating the allegations.'

Keldgate Manor (pictured), in East Yorkshire, is now being investigated by Humberside Police, the Care Quality Commission and the East Riding of Yorkshire Safeguarding Adults

David Fryer, regional engagement manager for the Care Quality Commission, which inspects homes across Britain, said: 'We are aware of the video footage taken by the family of a resident at Keldgate Manor and the significant concerns this has raised.

'We are in close liaison with the local authority safeguarding team, the police, and the provider to ensure these issues are investigated thoroughly and appropriate action is taken as required.

'Our priority will always be to ensure that people are safe and that their needs are being met and where we identify any risk to people living at the home we have a range of enforcement powers we can use.'

A Humberside Police spokesman said: 'We will be undertaking a joint investigation with East Riding of Yorkshire Safeguarding Adults to establish whether there are any incidents of abuse at Keldgate Manor Care Home.'
