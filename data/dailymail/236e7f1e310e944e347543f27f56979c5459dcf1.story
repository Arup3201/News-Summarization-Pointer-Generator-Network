We should cut funding for opera and give more money to brass bands, the former head of the Arts Council said yesterday.

Liz Forgan – who was in charge of the Government’s arts spending until last year – admitted organisations such as the Royal Opera House should be forced to raise more private money rather than rely on public funds.

Perhaps surprisingly for a woman who presided over the nation’s cultural elite for four years, she even claimed to prefer the brass bands of working-class northern towns to the music of Verdi and Wagner.

Money matters: The former head of the Arts Council Liz Forgan said funding for opera should be cut, and more money given to brass bands

She told the Commons culture, media and sport committee: ‘Brass bands can be as excellent as opera, no question. Indeed if you ask me, I’d rather listen to a brass band mostly.

‘The funding for opera is historic and extraordinary and it is an exception to all rules... It is completely bizarre and extraordinary.’

Earlier this month, Tory MP Philip Davies – whose constituency is in Shipley, west Yorkshire - revealed brass bands only received £1.8million in Arts Council funding over the past five years, compared with £347million for opera.

He asked Dame Liz why brass bands were considered to be an inferior art form, and whether opera should be forced to raise more money on its own.

She agreed that although the Royal Opera House, in London’s Covent Garden, was a ‘beacon of excellence’, it could survive with less money.

She said: If I was left to myself I would fund early and late opera, I wouldn’t fund the middle at all. I have 19th century opera. So I would fund Handel and Britten. That would be much cheaper.

Tradition: Dame Liz said she preferred the brass bands of working-class northern towns, such as the one depicted in 1996 film Brassed Off, to the music of Verdi and Wagner

‘It is capable of raising a very great deal of private money and the more pressure that is put on the Royal Opera House in particular to raise that money privately is good policy.’

She said it would be impossible to spend the opera budget all on brass bands, but added: ‘You probably could put the squeeze on Covent Garden a bit more.’

Dame Liz was appointed chairman of the Arts Council in 2009 but was asked to step down by former Culture Secretary Jeremy Hunt.

She was criticised last year for spending £8,130 of public money on her leaving party at the British Museum.

The Arts Council reclassified the event as a lecture in an already approved part of its budget.
