A Victorian prison, which is home to some of the state's most notorious underworld figures, bikies and violent offenders, is in lockdown after a small explosion, believed to have been triggered by a parcel bomb, occurred shortly after 1pm today.

The explosion occurred in an unoccupied cell at Barwon Prison near Geelong and a second bomb is believed to have been discovered before it detonated.

The jail was locked down an hour earlier than usual for the day, while emergency authorities were on site.
