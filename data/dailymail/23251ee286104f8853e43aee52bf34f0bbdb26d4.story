Two fathers had to be physically separated when they became embroiled in an angry row over parking outside their children's primary school.

The heated exchange, which was caught on camera, came just days after another father was punched in the face outside the school in an argument over dangerous parking.

Police have now been called in to patrol the streets around St Margaret's Primary in Whalley Range, Manchester, in the mornings and afternoons as the headmistress called for an end to 'violent behaviour', and expressed her fears that one of her pupils could be killed.

Intervention: Another parent had to separate the two men, who hurled abuse at ane another, before one banged on the other's car

Danger: The incident came just a week after an eight-year-old boy was struck by a car driven by a parent, while on his way into school

The incidents come just a week after an eight-year-old boy was struck by a car driven by a parent, while on his way into school.

He spent three days in hospital with abdominal injuries.

In a letter to parents sent out earlier 
this week, headteacher Alison White said she was 'at a loss for words 
that parents or carers are still behaving in a manner that is putting 
children's lives at risk'.

Warning: Headteacher Alison White called for calm in a letter to parents at the school, and warned that a child could be killed if the violence did not stop

The letter continues: 'It further saddens me 
that members of my staff and myself are being put in situations where 
parents/carers cannot control their tempers and are resulting [sic] to 
violent behaviour or verbal abuse towards one another.

'If we do not 
change our behaviours a child is going to be killed. It could be your 
child.'

In the earlier incident a father, aged in his 30s, was assaulted on Tuesday after challenging another parent over dangerous parking.

He had been crossing the road outside the school with his son when he spotted another parent parked illegally on zigzag yellow lines at the entrance.

After getting into an argument the driver, also a parent, got out of the car and punched the pedestrian in the face.

Ms White said: 'The parking outside of school has been and continues
to be a serious problem and the school has taken steps to alleviate the
problem and is working with councillors and the police.

'We are 
extremely pleased that the school is going to be part of the new 
Smartcar patrol which will identify those parents who are not changing 
their behaviour.

'Ultimately I feel it's the responsibility of the whole 
school community to ensure all our children are safe and this will only 
happen when all adults take responsibility for their actions.'

Fellow parents have also expressed their concerns about the arguments.

Mother-of-one Lindsey Gibbons, 26, whose daughter attends the nursery at St Margaret's, said: 'Parents arguing with each other is a daily occurrence.

'PTA members who try to help get abuse too.'

Worry: Ms White has urged parents to change their behaviour in order to keep children at the school safe

Warning: Parents have been told to change their behaviour, with police regularly patrolling the streets around the school in case of any trouble
