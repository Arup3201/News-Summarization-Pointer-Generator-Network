England will storm the barricades of the All Blacks’ most forbidding fortress on Saturday, as an invading force stripped of half its firepower, but armed with a defiant mantra: ‘the greater the challenge, the greater the opportunity’.

That is the tourists’ optimistic official line and on such a basis, this is the greatest opportunity England have had during Stuart Lancaster’s tenure.

Eden Park is the venue where visiting teams’ ambitions go to die.

Toughest test: Stuart Lancaster's England side face an almighty challenge in Saturday's match

New Zealand are unbeaten there since 1994 and England must try to shatter that home rule without more than a dozen key players.

What awaits the men left standing in the path of the Kiwi juggernaut has the look of an ordeal, rather than an opportunity, but Lancaster has set a bullish tone ahead of this series opener. The loss of first-choice scrum-half Danny Care maintains the routine of every best-laid plan being systematically undermined by a combination of injuries and a calamitous fixture clash.

This should have been the occasion for England to catch the hosts cold, before they settle back into their rhythm after seven months apart. Instead, the All Blacks have the luxury of finding their feet against chronically weakened opposition.

Lancaster will send out a capable team, but how he would wish to have Luther Burrell, Owen Farrell, Dylan Hartley, Courtney Lawes, Billy  Twelvetrees, Billy Vunipola and Tom Wood now, rather than belatedly in Dunedin and Hamilton.

Steve Hansen can unleash a New Zealand side with a dangerous look about it, even without his playmaker Dan Carter or world player of the year Kieran Read.

The All Blacks have 968 caps to England’s 367, along with the momentum from a perfect return of 14 straight victories in 2013.

They have power, unparalleled skills, home advantage and the scent of blood in their nostrils.Lancaster’s men have hope, without the expectation. The match-day script is seemingly set for an emphatic defeat — but they refuse to accept that the outcome is a foregone conclusion.

Freddie Burns typifies England’s predicament here. The fly half who has left Gloucester to join Leicester after a season scarred by collapsing form will be asked to wield the conductor’s baton in the No 10 shirt, and he is adamant that he can cope with the task.

‘I’m just excited,’ said the 24-year-old. ‘I don’t see it as a task you can get too nervous about. It’s a massive opportunity.

‘To play the All Blacks at Eden Park is something that you can’t be daunted by. We’ve been in camp for two weeks so we are chomping at the bit. The support the coaches have given me in being able to stay in camp and stay up to scratch with how the team want to  play has helped. It’s a case of me looking forward and seizing the opportunity.’

Lancaster justified Burns’ selection ahead of Danny Cipriani by suggesting that he had begun to climb out of his slump towards the end of the season.

Burns 
agreed, adding: ‘I feel confident now. In the last few games for 
Gloucester I was getting back to myself. In this environment, where 
everyone knows their roles, I feel back to my confident self.

‘A big weight is off my shoulders. Last season has been put to bed.

‘I see myself as a player who thrives in the big games and big atmospheres. If I miss the first kick — which I won’t — I’ll have to move on and deal with it. I am more mentally strong now.’

He will also have to be physically strong, especially when the All Blacks’ monster centre, Ma’a Nonu, is rampaging around the midfield. Burns expects plenty of traffic coming his way and added: ‘I am sure to be targeted, but that is a gauntlet I have to relish.’

After a gaffe earlier in the week from New Zealand lock Brodie Retallick, who couldn’t name a single England player and referred to Courtney Lawes as ‘Michael’, the All Blacks were at pains to avoid dishing up more motivation to their rivals yesterday.

One by one, the home players made diplomatic noises about their depleted opponents.

‘England are one of the best teams in the world,’ said full back Israel Dagg. ‘I’m sure whoever is playing will do a good job. It’s not going to be easy.’

Wing Ben Smith was similarly wary, adding: ‘England have shown they’ve got a lot of depth. A lot of the guys playing for them this weekend have played in the last 12 months and they will have a lot of motivation.’

Lock Sam Whitelock suggested that the big visiting pack could cause problems. ‘If we don’t front up, we will be embarrassed,’ he said. And scrum-half Aaron Smith insisted the stereotyping of England in these parts as one-dimensional no longer applies.

‘They play a good brand of rugby now,’ he said. ‘England scored a lot of good tries during the Six Nations. They are a big animal and we have to show them respect.’

Sadly, English hopes of an upset have been shattered. Lancaster’s squad have sufficient fortitude to make a game of it but, ultimately, the gulf in experience and quality will be too great. If they can take the All Blacks to the edge then next week — when reinforcements are ready — the ordeal could become an opportunity after all.

Tony Woodcock v David Wilson 

The All Blacks loosehead is a Test veteran with 107 caps. The 33-year-old started all seven matches when New Zealand won the World Cup in 2011, scoring the crucial try in the final. He is a potent scrummager; a wily prop as well as a sturdy one. Wilson must resist Woodcock’s attempts to undermine England’s set-piece at the end of a season of considerable personal success. The giant Bath tighthead has responded well when deputising for the injured Dan Cole, but he was under the cosh in a scrum contest with Alex Corbisiero during his club’s recent defeat to Northampton in the Amlin Challenge Cup Final.

Richie McCaw v Chris Robshaw

This is the clash of the captains, who lead their respective sides as opposing openside flankers. McCaw is the master of his craft – a legend of the modern era who has been named World Player of the Year a record three times. He is a renowned breakdown menace who attracts grudging admiration for his ability to keep referees onside while bending the laws to his will. Robshaw has become widely admired as England skipper and is an energetic, influential and increasingly dynamic figure, but he is not known as a poacher of turn-overs. He must resist the black tide in the rucks, but will count on assistance from the likes of James Haskell and Joe Launchbury.

Ma’a Nonu v Manu Tuilagi

These wrecking-ball centres are not in direct opposition, as Nonu will wear 12 for the All Blacks and Tuilagi is at 13 for England, but they have similar roles. Both will be charged with generating space and front-foot attacking possession by blasting holes in the opposition defensive line. Nonu is a fearsome runner who has added layers of guile and artistry to his game. Tuilagi will serve as England’s attacking fulcrum and primary weapon. He is still developing the distribution range and awareness of his rival, but the strapping Tiger is an explosive force of nature in midfield, as New Zealand discovered to their cost at Twickenham in 2012.
