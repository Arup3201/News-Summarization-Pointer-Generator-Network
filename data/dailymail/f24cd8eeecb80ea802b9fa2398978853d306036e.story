Nokia has launched its fightback against iTunes in the UK with MixRadio - a music service which offers 26 million songs available to stream for free.

This is the equivalent of 200 years worth of music and uses can rate individual tracks using the 'thumbs up' and 'thumbs down' buttons.

MixRadio then creates personalised mixes including songs a user likes, as well as tracks from similar artists or genres, all of which can be listened without adverts or subscriptions.

Nokia has launched its MixRadio music service offering 26 million songs to stream for free. As users listen to music they can rate individual tracks using the 'thumbs up' and 'thumbs down' buttons. MixRadio then creates personalised mixes that include songs a user likes, as well as tracks from similar artists or genres

The MixRadio mobile app is available to Nokia Windows Phone owners in 31 countries.

As users listen to music they can rate individual tracks using the 'thumbs up' and 'thumbs down' buttons.

MixRadio then creates personalised 
mixes including songs a user likes, as well as tracks from similar 
artists or genres, all of which can be listened to without adverts.

The service doesn't automatically store 
songs and data on the handset, although if people do want to listen to 
music without an internet connection, they can save the mixes for when 
they're offline.

The app comes in a free and premium (paid-for) option.

The free version lets users download up to 
four playlists to listen to offline, or a total of eight hours of music.

Under the free option, users can also skip up to six songs an hour.

The paid-for option costs $3.99 (£2.50) a month and comes with unlimited offline playlists and skips.

If a user doesn't like a song, they can skip it and free users can skip up to six songs an hour.

Alternatively, users can choose from a list of  150 playlists created by Nokia’s 'mixologists'.

And unlike iTunes, the service doesn't automatically store songs and data on the handset.

However, if people do want to listen to music without an internet connection, they can save the mixes for when they're offline.

The service is a rebranding of the 
Finnish firm's Nokia Music service that launched in 2011.

The new version of the app has also added the option to share mixes with friends.

Head of Nokia Entertainment Jyrki Rosenberg said: 'We have made our mission clear, to provide the most simple, personal radio streaming service available.

'Nokia MixRadio marries simplicity with an incredible level of personalization, for a mobile first approach that will help everybody, not just the avid music fan, enjoy and discover new music for free.

'It's as easy as turning on the radio, but you're in control - just one touch of a button provides people with their own personal radio station, free of adverts, sign ups and sign-ins.

MixRadio doesn't automatically store songs on a Nokia handset, although if people do want to listen to music without an internet connection, they can save the mixes for when they're offline. Free users can save up to four offline playlists or for $3.99 (£2.50) a month they can save an unlimited amount

If a user doesn't like a song, they can skip it and free users can skip up to six songs an hour

'You can even skip songs you don't like,
 as well as build your station around your likes and dislikes with the 
unique thumbs up and down feature.'

The service is now available to Nokia Windows Phone owners.

The free version lets users download up to 
four playlists to listen to offline, or a total of eight hours of music, or they can pay $3.99 (£2.50) a month for unlimited offline lists.

Music producer Nile Rogers has created a series of exclusive mixes for the service which users can download for free.

The 'Get Lucky' producer said: 'Radio has always been the way most people discover new music, but the format hasn't really changed since the 50's.

'I love this because it's radio for the digital generation, simple, immediate and unique, and the MixSharing feature means people can create and transmit their own radio station.

'More people discovering great music is always a good thing.'
