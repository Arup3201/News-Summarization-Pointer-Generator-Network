Painful: Jeff Luptak accidentally shot a 3 inch long nail deep into his head from a nail gun when he was installing flooring

Shooting a three inch nail into your skull, sounds like a painful experience, but when construction worker Jeff Luptak accidentally did exactly this, he surprisingly reported that he 'didn't feel any pain.'

Infact his first concern was saving the new baseball cap that was pinned to his head.

'The doctors told me they were going to have to cut my hat off,' said Jeff, who got it as a freebie for spending lots of cash at a sporting goods store.

'I jokingly told them: You can't do that. I had to spend $300 to get that hat,' he added.   

The potentially fatal accident 
accident happened on February 1 when Jeff, 45, was working on a new 
house in Bismarck, North Dakota, where he lives with his 38-year-old 
wife Kim and their three daughters.

Mr Luptak was in the basement, installing flooring, when he asked another worker standing above him to hand him a nail gun.   

'When
I reached up to get it I pulled it down and I heard it go off. I 
immediately felt this pressure in my skull so I knew I'd just got shot 
in the head,' he said.  

'I didn't feel any pain. All I felt was some pressure, like somebody was pushing their thumb down on my head.'   

Skull damage: After the accident Mr Luptak, still conscious, was rushed to a 
hospital in Bismarck. Doctors took X-rays that showed the nail had 
penetrated almost 3 inches into his skull

Scar reminder: Jeff was flown 500 miles to another hospital in St. Paul, Minnesota, where a team of brain surgeons successfully removed the nail

Mr Luptak made his way to a ladder to climb out of the basement when he suddenly felt his legs shaking.

'I
thought: I'm going into shock. I'm going to die right here. I thought 
of my wife and kids. I thought: Oh God, I'm never going to see them 
again,' he said.

Mr Luptak,
still conscious, was rushed to a hospital in Bismarck.

Doctors took 
X-rays that showed the nail had penetrated almost 3 inches into his 
skull.

'The doctor said the nail was either in a main artery or right beside it. He said he didn't want to attempt to pull it out because he was afraid I'd bleed to death,' he said.

Mr Luptak was flown 500 miles to another hospital in St. Paul, Minnesota, where a team of brain surgeons successfully removed the nail.

They removed a golf ball size piece of his skull, extracted the nail, put a titanium plate over the opening and then used 26 staples to put back the piece of skull they'd taken out. 

'After the surgery, a nurse told me: You're the luckiest unlucky guy I've ever seen,' he said

Mr Luptak spent a week in hospital and is expected to make a full recovery.

As for the precious hat, Mr Luptak said: 'They were able to save it. They just cut a small hole in the top of it. I can still wear and it serves as a reminder that I've been given a second chance on life.'
