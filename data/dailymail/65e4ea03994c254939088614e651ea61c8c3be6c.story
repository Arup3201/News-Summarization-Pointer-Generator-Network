Sergio Ramos has tried to diffuse a brewing club vs country battle between Chelsea and Spain by insisting he was not referring to Diego Costa and Cesc Fabregas when he questioned certain players' commitment to La Roja.

Speaking to Radio Marcos on Wednesday, Ramos said: 'It depends on the player's make-up but I would have cleared up the matter so there were no repercussions and no room for any doubts.

‘Often with injuries there can be a world of difference between what we have and what is said in public.

‘It’s difficult because this is not a club team but the national team where you do not come every day. Laying out rules is difficult. But above all I would have liked the players to show the same commitment to the national team as they do to their club.

‘You must show this commitment and spirit to all the new players. There are times I have played despite having some niggles. It all depends on the DNA of the player. ‘I wish players had same the level of commitment with the national team as with their clubs.'

Ramos' comments were interpreted as a direct response to Diego Costa pulling out of the Spain squad before playing, and scoring, against Liverpool, and Fabregas returning to London after arriving in Madrid with a hamstring complaint.

But Ramos has done his best to calm the waters saying: 'When I spoke about commitment I did not want to say that those two did not have it.

The row between Chelsea and Spain has been simmering all season with Vicente del Bosque ignoring Jose Mourinho's desire for Costa not to play two games in a week during the last international break.

The striker returned with a hamstring injury and missed the next two games with his club.

Adding fuel to the flames is the shared history of Mourinho, Ramos and Spain captain Iker Casillas.

Mourinho fell out with the goalkeeper when he was his manager at Real Madrid because Casillas felt that Mourinho's cranking up of tension between Barcelona and Real Madrid was affecting the national side.

Much to Mourinho's disgust he even called Barcelona's Xavi to make peace between the two camps.
