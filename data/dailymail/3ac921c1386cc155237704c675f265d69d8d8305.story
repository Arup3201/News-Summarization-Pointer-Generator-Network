Armed: Boston gangster James 'Whitey' Bulger made frequent trips to Boston while on the run for 16 years

Notorious gangster James 'Whitey' Bulger boasted to agents that he returned to Boston in disguise and 'armed to the teeth' several times during his 16 years on the run.

He also told them that he flew to Las Vegas 'to play on the slots' as well as travelling to San Diego and even crossing the border to Mexico to buy medication.

The revelations about Bulger's description of life in hiding were included in a memo filed on Monday by federal prosecutors who are objecting to Bulger's request for a taxpayer-funded attorney.

After he was arrested, agents found 
$822,198 in cash in his apartment, much of it in packages containing 
$100 bills that were hidden inside a wall, prosecutors said, money which
is now frozen.

Bulger fled Massachusetts in 1995 with his moll Catherine Greig and was finally captured last week after 16 years on the run.

The 81-year-old, former leader of the infamous Winter Hill Gang who is charged in connection with 19 murders, was arrested in Santa Monica, California, after spending years on the FBI's Ten Most Wanted list.

Bulger, who was also a top-echelon FBI informant, fled Boston after he was tipped by his former FBI handler that he was about to be indicted.

He made the shocking disclosures while being brought back to Boston by federal agents, when he 'admitted that he had been a frequent traveller as a fugitive', Assistant U.S. Attorneys Brian Kelly and Fred Wyshak Jr. said in their memo.

They said Bulger admitted travelling to Boston several times 'armed to the teeth' because he 'had to take care of some unfinished business'.

Kelly and Wyshak wrote: 'Bulger refused to elaborate on whom he visited, when exactly he visited, and who was with him on these trips to Boston.'

Bulger waived his Miranda rights on the flight and boasted to the agents about the many trips he took while on the run, saying he also visited Las Vegas - a city blanketed with security cameras - to play the slots on numerous occasions and 'claimed he won more than he lost'.

He also claimed to have travelled to San Diego, then crossed the Mexican border into Tijuana to buy medications, according to the memo.

Bulgerâ€™s reference to San Diego is of 
particular interest since he was possibly sighted there by a DEA agent 
in November of 2006 leaving a showing of the Scorcese movie The Departed, in which 
the villain is loosely based on him.

The prosecutors also said Bulger told the U.S. Pretrial Services office in Los Angeles that his brother, former Massachusetts Senate President William Bulger, may be willing to help post bail for Catherine Greig, Bulger's long-time girlfriend who was arrested with him after the couple was found in California.

Greig, 60, is charged with harbouring a fugitive.

Kelly and Wyshak said the court should require an affidavit from William Bulger and another Bulger brother, John, before deciding whether Whitey Bulger is entitled to a public defender.

Peter Krupp, an attorney who represented Whitey Bulger at his initial appearance in court last week, said no one in Bulger's family has offered to help him pay for his defence.

In their memo, prosecutors say that during his 16 years on the run, Bulger 'financed a relatively comfortable lifestyle' for himself and Greig.

After he was arrested, agents found $822,198 in cash in his apartment, much of it in packages containing $100 bills that were hidden inside a wall, prosecutors said, money which is now frozen.

Prosecutor Brian Kelly suggested Bulger has additional hidden assets.

The mobster also had two cell phones and
'other items' still being analysed to determine the 'whereabouts of 
additional assets', court documents say.

'He has every incentive to lie and stick the taxpayers with the bill for his defence,' prosecutors said in the filing.

Kelly said in court last week that prosecutors plan to seek forfeiture of the money. Money that is earned illegally is subject to forfeiture to the government.

U.S. District Court Judge Mark Wolf will hold a hearing Tuesday on Bulger's request for a public defender.

Greig is due back in U.S. District Court in Boston on Thursday for a detention hearing.
