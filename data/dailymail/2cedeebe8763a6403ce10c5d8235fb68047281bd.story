Amazon has launched its first mobile phone in a bid to take on Apple and Google.

The Fire handset was unveiled by Jeff Bezos at a special event in Seattle.

'It's time to whip the crown from Apple,' said Mr Bezos before showing off the new handset for the first time.

Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos holds up the new Amazon Fire Phone. The handset has a 4.7-inch display with 720p HD resolution, a quad-core Qualcomm Snapdragon processor, 2GB of RAM, and six individual camera modules to make the 3D effect work.

The device has a front facing camera in each corner of the screen.

These extra cameras are used to track the position of the user’s face and eyes in relation to the phone’s display.

The handset chooses the two best views, and can even work at night using infrared.

This allows Amazon’s software to make constant adjustments to the positioning of on-screen elements, altering the perspective of visuals on the screen and making them appear to be in 3D - without the need for glasses.

The Fire will use head-tracking technology to make images on the smartphone's display appear to be 3D with a feature called 'dynamic perspective'.

'There is always more to see by changing your perspective,' Bezos said.

'What if there were a thousand artists standing by to redraw the picture every time you moved your head?'

Apps using the new feature includes a Maps app that lets users see around buildings.

Users can also tilt the phone to 'look around' an on screen map.

The handset has a 4.7-inch display with 720p HD resolution, a quad-core Qualcomm Snapdragon processor, 2GB of RAM, and six individual camera modules to make the 3D effect work.

It will run a highly customized version of Google’s Android operating system similar to the one seen on Amazon’s Kindle Fire tablets, and come with special tangle-free headphones.

Apps available at launch include Netflix, HBO Go, Hulu Plus and ESPN.

It also boasts a Gorilla Glass 3 screen with a rubber frame, and aluminum buttons.

Users will also have unlimited photo storage via the Amazon Cloud, and syncing with the company's recently launched Fire TV set-top box so you can send media to your TV.

The phone has its own menu system, and users can even navigate by tilting the handset. They can also see different app catergies through a special 'tray' that appears when they swip (right)

'Fire Phone puts everything you love about Amazon in the palm of your hand—instant access to Amazon’s vast content ecosystem and exclusive features like the Mayday button, ASAP, Second Screen, X-Ray, free unlimited photo storage, and more,' said Bezos.

'The Firefly button lets you identify printed web and email addresses, phone numbers, QR and bar codes, artwork, and over 100 million items, including songs, movies, TV shows, and products—and take action in seconds.'

The MayDay 24-hour video help feature will also be available on Fire Phone, Amazon confirmed.

Bezos said the most important thing the firm has done was to 'earn trust with customers'.

The handset will initially be offered in the US only by AT&T in a deal that echoes the launch of the original iPhone.

The deal has already riled AT&T's competitors,

Seattle based T-Mobile’s chief executive, John Legere, tweeted, 'Really, @Amazon? What happened to home-town pride?'

Amazon also announced that the Fire Phone will come with a new app called Firefly.

This uses the camera and visual recognition to identify objects ranging from books to CDs as well as listen to music before looking for it on Amazon.

The feature will also recognise phone numbers and web addresses, as well as TV shows.

Amazon claims it can recognise 100 million items in less than one second.

Once an item is recognised, it can automatically take users to the corresponding Amazon page so they can buy it.

The app is triggered by holding the same button that serves as a shortcut to the Fire Phone's camera.

Peter Woodd, CEO at phone accessory maker IDT Systems said 'The effect this will have on the Smartphone industry are substantial.

'Consumers are constantly looking for the newest and most innovative device and if Amazon’s Smartphone offers the suggested 3D viewing capabilities, the usual players may find their hold decreasing.'

It is the first time the retailer has created a phone, and follows on from the success of the Kindle eReader and Kindle Fire tablet, with sales of eBooks overtaking those of physical copies in the UK in 2012.

Although Amazon did not confirm a release date for the UK, experts predict it will be on sale this year outside the US.

Amazon had designed its own software for the phone. There, the app grid is showing - and users can even tilt the handset to navigate through it

The handset has been under development since 2009 at Lab126, Amazon’s secretive Silicon Valley hardware division.

More than 1,600 people claim Lab126 as their employer on the professional networking site LinkedIn, according to Business Week.

Web site BGR said the design looked like an iPhone.

'In fact, it appears to take design cues from several existing smartphones including Apple’s iPhone, Samsung’s Galaxy S lineup and even the HTC One, which has a polished, chamfered bezel much like the one seen on Amazon’s phone.'

Ernest Doku, mobiles expert at uSwitch.com said: 'Amazon already has two very effective power-ups in its armoury: brand power and reams of content that smartphone users can soup up their mobiles with. Add those to a quality handset and the mobile market may well have a Trojan Horse on its hands.'

Duncan Bell, operations editor at UK-based gadget magazine T3 said: 'The Amazon phone's solid hardware and verging-on-pointless software features are irrelevant here. Amazon sees this as a platform to flog its content, just as it did with ebooks on Kindles. Problem is, all its video and audio content is or will be available on every other device known to humanity, leaving no compelling reason to buy its own phone.'

Ramzi Yakob, industry expert and strategist at digital agency TH-NK said: 'Alarm bells started ringing when I realised that Jeff Bezos had spent more than twice the amount of time explaining how Dynamic Perspective was developed than actually showing us what it can do to improve the user experience. It clearly isn't a game changer.'

Ernest Doku, mobiles expert at uSwitch.com, said: 'Arriving so late to the over-crowded smartphone party requires tactical consideration, and Amazon has covered all bases with a handset which is both big on spectacle and packed with features.

'Amazon already has two very effective power-ups in its armoury: brand power and reams of content that smartphone users can soup up their mobiles with.

'Add those to a quality handset and the mobile market may well have an Trojan Horse on its hands.

'Amazon’s killer blow lies in its deep connection to the Prime subscription service. The Fire Phone is rather a gateway into its millions of books, movies and music on-demand, making the device key to a very appealing package.

The handset has as 13MP camera - and Bezos claims it can take better pictures that the iPhone 5s and Galaxy S5

Previously images of the handset have leaked online.

'Finally, we have obtained exclusive photos of a prototype of the unreleased device, giving the world its first look at Amazon’s hotly anticipated phone, web site has previously BGR said.

'As can be seen in the images, the device is covered by a protective shell intended to prevent people without authorization from seeing the physical design of the phone.'

The handset has been runoured for weeks-  which Bezos acknowledged with this slide

The Amazon handset has a beveled edge similar to apple's iPhone 5

Apple's patented system is slightly different to the 3D display Amazon is rumoured to be working on. The first pictures of Amazon's 3D handset were revealed last week, pictured, and appeared to feature four cameras and retina-tracking technology that are used to create a 'floating screen' effect

It comes just weeks after the firm launched Fire TV, a set top box that doubles as a games console.

The box allows users to download films and TV shows, along with apps.

To play games, users can use a remote, or buy a separate game controller for $40.

Amazon's much rumoured holophone is set to be announced on June 18. The retailer released a teaser video on Wednesday, showing people's reaction to the device. Previously images of the handset have leaked online. The latest images (pictured) reveal a relatively thin handset - that looks a lot like Apple's iPhone

Mike Frazzini from Amazon Games said each game will be priced like a phone app, costing on average $2.

Games available at launch will include Minecraft, driving game Asphalt 8 and first person shooter Sev Zero, created by the games studio double Helix Microsoft bought recently.

Peter Larsen from Amazon said the firm wanted to 'invent and simplify' with the box.

'It's incredibly powerful, and it's unbelievably simple,' he said.

The move would pit Amazon in a battle with Google and Apple, which is expected to unveil its latest iPhone in September

'Tiny box, huge specs, tons of content, incredible price—people are going to love Fire TV,” said Jeff Bezos, Amazon.com Founder and CEO.

The service uses Amazon's existing Prime TV and film on demand service, along with Hulu Plus.

The gadget, costing $99, is aimed squarely at Amazon and Roku's products along with google's Chromecast.

Following Amazon's foray into the tablet market with the Kindle Fire and Kindle Fire HD - being shown off here by CEO Jeff Bezo - the company is said to now be working on a smartphone with a 3D screen

The firm said it plans to add more services in the future.

Amazon already offers on-demand TV shows and movies free to customers who are members of Amazon's premium shipping service Prime, in both the UK and US.

Speculation about Amazon smartphones began in 2011.
