New York should change resisting arrest to a felony charge so criminals who do so face harsher penalties, NYPD Commissioner Bill Bratton said today.

Increasing the punishment for the crime that can lead to 'potential injuries to the officer', was one of several recommendations Mr Bratton made to a joint hearing of four State Senate Committees. 

Resisting arrest is currently a misdemeanor carrying a maximum punishment of one year.

Mr Bratton argued that wasn't a significant enough penalty to deter the 2,000 criminals that resist arrest each year.

'I think a felony would be very helpful in terms of raising the bar significantly in the penalty for the resistance of arrest,' Mr Bratton told the Observer.

He said when criminals resisted arrest it could lead to both police and civilians getting injured.  

'We need to get around this idea that you can resist arrest. You can't. You just can't do it. It results in potential injuries to the officer, to the suspect. And we need to change that, and the way to change that is to start penalties for it.'

In pushing for the change, Mr Bratton acknowledged that the charge was sometimes misused, saying 'the vast majority might end up being dismissed'. Advocates say the charge is often the only one someone is facing, regardless of whether they actually resisted arrest, because other charges have been dismissed or dropped.

But the commissioner said part of the push was also to get district attorneys to treat the charge 'more seriously'. He said the charge would be better tracked to see how often it was being dropped.

About 2,000 criminals a year resist arrest which Mr Bratton said led to both officers and civilians being injured

Mr Bratton also called for harsher penalties for fatally assaulting an officer, school safety agent or auxiliary officer. 

Improved safety measures called for by the commissioner included bulletproof glass for police cars, stiffer penalties for publicizing an officer's personal details and tighter controls around motorists tinting their windows.
