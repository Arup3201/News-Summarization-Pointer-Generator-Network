A Seattle homeless man known only as 'Moleman' has dug up a massive series of underground tunnels in a local park, drawing the ire of local residents and befuddling parks officials who can't pinpoint where the digger has gone.

The results of his labor are obvious: the trails and holes he's dug up zig-zag through Cheasty Greenspace, complete with ditches, steps and even an elaborate irrigation system.

'They call him the Moleman,' neighbor Ed Newbold told KIRO-TV. 'He has a fear of what he calls noxious weeds, and he's dug up about half-acre of the area.'

But nobody in the neighborhood of Beacon Hill can find the man, who local residents say may be called 'James.'

Seattle Parks officials often find signs that he's been around, from mattresses to trash cans left behind in Cheasty Greenspace, a 43-acre woodland habitat in south Seattle.

Yet they're still trying to hand the man a no-trespassing order, after he's ignored all their notices to remove his belongings from the park.

Just on Wednesday, they combed through the park once again â€” but Moleman was nowhere to be found, KIRO-TV reported.

Local environmentalists say Moleman's work has destroyed some of the city's wetlands, aside from being plain unsightly

Neighbors say that they've complained for some four years.

'They are ignoring their own responsibility,' Newbold told the station. 'As stewards of this land, they should be doing something about it.'

Local environmentalists say Moleman has destroyed sensitive parts of the park, including protected wetlands.

Along with ditches, Moleman has created a series of stairs and even an irrigation system going through the Seattle park

Taxpayers will have to pick up the tab, to the tune of tens of thousands of dollars, KIRO-TV reported.

'It's not only unsightly,' Newbold told the station. 'It's doing real damage to the area.'

City officials say that Moleman is homeless and they're trying refer him to social services in hopes of finding him a new place to live.

They've tried asked him to leave before, but he always comes back to dig some more.
