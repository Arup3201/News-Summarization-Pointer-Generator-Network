Police called on the public today to help find several people who attacked officers during a May Day protest in downtown Los Angeles.

Chief Charlie Beck shared video images at a news conference of two attacks on officers that occurred after a splinter group broke from the main march on Broadway and briefly skirmished with police.

In one video, a man is seen hitting a female officer from behind, smashing what appears to be a metallic-coloured drum into her helmeted head.

The incident occurred at about 4:15pm at the intersection of Fourth and Hill streets, where Occupy protesters and activist groups had rallied for May Day.

'This is a serious crime against a Los Angeles police officer who was just doing her job,' Beck said.

The attacker appears to be a dark-haired young man with a mop top hairdo.

Scene: The incident occurred at about 4:15pm at 
the intersection of Fourth and Hill streets, where  activist groups had gathered on Tuesday

Violence: The officer had to be treated for a minor concussion and was resting at home, police said

Investigation: Police have urged anyone who has information about the protesters involved in the attack to come forward

The officer had to be treated for a minor concussion and was resting at home, Beck said.

In another video, a group of protesters is seen smashing into a skirmish line of officers with a wooden pallet, again from behind.

Beck called the attacks cowardly and noted that the majority of protesters demonstrated peacefully on Tuesday.

No arrests have been made in the attacks, and police are seeking at least three suspects.

At another May Day demonstration at Los Angeles International Airport, 10 union demonstrators were arrested for blocking an intersection.

Beck urged anyone who has information about the protesters involved in the attacks to contact police.

'Don’t let the actions of very few individuals detract from what was a very successful May Day,' Beck said.
