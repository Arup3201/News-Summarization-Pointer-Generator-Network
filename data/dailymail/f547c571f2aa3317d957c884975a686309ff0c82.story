It's another three months till Christmas but if you want to deck the halls in truly ostentatious style, you better start saving now.

For only those with the very deepest of pockets will be able to afford a very bling Christmas tree that was unveiled in Japan today.

The Takashimaya department store in Tokyo displayed a £1 billion yen (£6m) festive tree.

How expensive are your branches: The tree is covered in ornaments made from the precious metal

Valuable: A security guard stands next to the gold tree

It has gold branches which have been adorned with cups, pots and candle stands, also made from the precious metal, and topped with a gold star.

To add some festive colour, it was also decorated with red baubles, bows and flowers.

The Christmas tree is on display as part of the gold products exhibition in Tokyo that is taking place this week.

Midas touch: These lions and dragon statues are made from gold

Worth their weight in gold: The lion is 40kg and the dragon 1.8kg

A security guard stood watch beside the exhibit to ensure nobody tried to help themselves to an early Christmas present by taking one of the expensive decorations.

But the Christmas tree wasn't the only exhibit on show worth millions.

A pair of gold Chinese lions  weighing 80kg were on show that are also worth £6m.

Meanwhile, there was also a 1.8kg pure gold dragon that costs 27.5 million yen (£171,000).
