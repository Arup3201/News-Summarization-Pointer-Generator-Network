It must be one of the most bizarre acts of ‘charity’ ever performed.

The tour manager of boyband One Direction has visited two British drugs smugglers in a Peru jail – to give them Easter eggs and a KFC.

Paul Higgins went to see cocaine mules Melissa Reid and Michaella McCollum Connolly – nicknamed the Peru Two – when One Direction went to Lima for a concert.

As well as giving chocolate eggs and takeaway meals to the 20-year-olds, Higgins handed out free tickets for the concert to the children of families visiting the prison.

The Irishman also talked to the women about dealing with the pressures of ‘fame’.

Last night a source close to the band said: ‘Paul does a lot of work for charity that you just don’t hear about.

‘He was in Peru with One Direction and during his downtime he decided that the Christian thing to do would be to visit an Irish person [McCollum Connolly is from Belfast] who was in prison.

The crew also made a trip to Machu Picchu, Peru, where they were filmed taking in the world-famous sights

'He felt that seeing a friendly face would give her a lift.

'He does not know her [Michaella] or the family and he did not tell any of One Direction that he was going.

‘He was just trying to do a good deed as he felt that there wouldn’t be many visitors coming from Ireland to see them.

'He is not there to judge them for what they did nor does he condone anything they have done.’

They are on a tour of Latin America. Here, some of the members are pictured in Santiago, Chile

Billy Reid, father of Melissa, who is from Lenzie, near Glasgow, said last night: ‘It’s great of him to do that and take time out of his busy schedule to visit them. I’m sure Melissa and Michaella would have been thrilled.

‘I think it will have helped the girls to hear about how One Direction cope with fame because since everything has happened they’ve been pushed into the spotlight… but obviously for different reasons.’

The women were each jailed for six years and eight months in December after trying to smuggle £1.5 million worth of cocaine out of Peru in their suitcases.
