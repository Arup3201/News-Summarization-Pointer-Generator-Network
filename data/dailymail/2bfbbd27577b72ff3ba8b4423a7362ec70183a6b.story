I’m currently planning the next move for Tony Bellew after he got his revenge over Nathan Cleverly. We all expected fireworks and unfortunately the main event just didn’t live up to it. 

But Tony did what he had to do and now has a great future in front of him – I’m in talks with both Marco Huck and Yoan Hernandez about cruiserweight world-title fights with Tony.

The rest of the division know that he sells. The numbers from the weekend were very good and that makes him commercially attractive to all of them.

At the moment, it looks like his next fight will be for a world title in the spring. We are already in discussions with Huck, the WBO champion from Germany, and I can reveal we are also talking to Hernandez, the Cuban who has the IBF belt.

We have seen the city of Liverpool get behind Tony and I am in talks about putting on a fight for him at Goodison Park. The question is whether we could get one of the world champions to fight over here.

From that point of view, Hernandez seems more willing to travel, so we’ll wait and see how it pans out in the next few weeks.
