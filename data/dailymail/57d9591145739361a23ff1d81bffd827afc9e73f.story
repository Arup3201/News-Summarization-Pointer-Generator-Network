There was an outpouring of emotion from the family of a Michigan state trooper shot dead during a routine traffic stop after a 20-year-old man was convicted of his murder on Tuesday.

Eric Knysz was found guilty in the September shooting death of 43-year-old Trooper Paul Butterfield II. Prosecutors said Knysz had stolen guns with him when Butterfield pulled over his pickup truck in Mason County, in west-central Michigan.

Sentencing is set for April 18, though first-degree murder carries a mandatory penalty of life in prison without the possibility of parole in Michigan.

In his closing arguments, defense attorney David Glancy noted that the only witness who could place Knysz in the pickup that day was his wife, Sarah, who testified against him. Glancy said she benefited from a plea deal with prosecutors that brought her a sentence of two to five years in prison as an accessory after the fact.

But jurors sided with prosecutors after deliberating for about two hours.

"Justice was served," Col. Kriste Kibbey Etue, state police commander, told the Ludington Daily News.

Butterfield's fiancee, Jen Sielski, said the verdict doesn't bring back Butterfield but protects the public.

"At least the killer won't hurt anyone else," Sielski said.

At the December 2013 sentencing of 
Sarah Knysz for being an accessory, Mr Butterfield Sr handed her a 
family photo and told her: 'I have seen your tears. I believe your tears
 are not a result of sorrow for our son’s death, but because you got 
caught.'

After telling the 
court the happiest day of his life was when his son was born, he turned 
to Knysz, who is nine months pregnant, and said: 'I hope for the sake of
 [your] child that he or she is removed totally from your family and 
adopted [by a loving, stable family].'

Knysz,
 who was in the car at the time of the shooting had told the court it 
was out of fear for her life and that of her unborn child that she 
protected her husband after the shooting, M Live reported.

'There wasn’t anything that I thought I could have done that day,' she said.

'He
 had a gun and he shot the trooper, and if he did that, what was he 
going to do to a witness that was going to tell on him and was going to 
turn him in? I just wanted to keep me and my baby safe. I was just 
thinking about my baby.'

She added: 'I didn’t mean for any of this to happen, and I didn’t have control over it happening.'

After the shooting, Sarah Knysz removed her cell phone battery and erased its memory and helped her husband move belongings from the pick up truck to a car he had stolen.

Despite being seen in two stores afterwards she did nothing to raise the alarm, the court was told.

The victim's fiancee, Jennifer Sielski, told the court, Butterfield made her feel 'like the luckiest woman in the world ... He protected me when I needed to feel safe. He was my friend, my inspiration, my hero, my soulmate.'
