When a young Chinese father was photographed on holiday with his one-year-old daughter he had no idea he'd begun an enduring family tradition.

Hua Yunqing,  62, was photographed with his daughter Huahua while on a day trip to a local beauty spot and liked the picture so much that he has since returned to the same location every year to repeat the photo.

Over the following 35 years Hua and his daughter Huahua, 36, would take the same shot every year beside the same lake in Zhenjiang, a city in eastern China's Jiangsu province, showing the little girl growing up, her father slowly ageing and  the scenery around them changing as time passed.

This photo of Hua and Huahua taken in 1980 when she was just one-year-old was the very first in Hua's long collection 

In fact during their 35 years of taking the pictures they have only missed one year, in 1998 when Huahua missed the trip to the family's favourite lake. 

As he and his daughter have grown, their changing lives are documented in the photographs and not purely because the pair are ageing.

The photos capture the changing fashions and capture Huahua's journey into adulthood and then motherhood, as her own children started to be snapped in the annual shot.  

Hua who posted the photos taken at Taying Lake online, said recreating the image each year has since become one of the family's customs.

'I didn't have any thought of doing the same thing again but when I got the photo back, I liked it so much that when we went back the next year I repeated it.

'After that it became sort of the family tradition and we did it every year with only one break in 1998 when my daughter did not join us for the family holiday and was abroad.' 

Hua added that the photos have documented his daughter's growth from a small baby to a child, into an awkward teen, a pretty young woman and now as she becomes a parent herself.

'When I started I never guessed that I'd still be doing this when I was in my 60s and my daughter is now no longer alone, she is a mother-of-two.'

He said he was not expecting his family to continue the tradition forever but after posting images online he was delighted with the positive reaction.

Hua liked the picture so much that he insisted on returning to the spot each year to reenact the picture. Huahua smiles at the age of two (left) and mimics her father's pose at three (right)

Each year the father and daughter visit the same lake in Zhenjiang, a city in eastern China's Jiangsu province

Each photo sees the pair adopt a slightly different pose. Huahua looks a little shy in 1985 (left) and the father-daughter duo don their swimsuits for this lively snap in 1986 (right)

As well as showing the pair getting older, the pictures document the changing fashions of the decade. Huahua wears a girly white dress at the age of eight (left) and just a year later has grown her hair out and opted for funkier clothes (right)

The pair wear matching sandals on this hot day at the lake in 1989 as Hua shows off a more relaxed attitude to fashion

At the turn of the decade Huahua beams at the camera at the age of 11, wearing shorts, T-shirt and her hair brushed into a side parting

The father and daughter opt for matching poses in 1991 (left) and in 1992 (right) adopt more serious expressions

As she gets into her teens Huahua's style starts to change and the pictures see her go from girly (left) to sporty (right)

In 1995, Huahua, now aged 16, has started wearing braces and glasses while her father remains seemingly ageless

At 17 (left) Huahua has barely changed but just a year later she takes on a shorter hairstyle while as her father appears almost identical

In 1998 Huahua did not join the family on holiday but in 1999 she's clearly developing her own style at the age of 20

At the start of the Millennium Huahua adopts classic styles of the time including crimped hair and ankle bracelets 

Just one year on (left) Huahua has transformed her hair with a heavy fringe and in 2002 (right) Hua appears more casual in jeans and cap

At 24 Huahua looks elegant and ladylike (left) and carries a designer  handbag, a style she carries through to the following year

But by the following year Huahua is back to her hipster preppy style, as she and her father pose beam by the lake

Hua seems eager for some photography of his own in 2006 (left) and the proud father is accompanied by his sophisticated daughter a year on

2008 sees the arrival of Huahua's first daughter (left), adding an extra family member to the  annual photo in 2009 as well

2010 sees Hua's first grandchild growing up fast as the trio laugh for their annual photo

By 2011 (left) Huahua's daughter is walking and in 2012 (right) they are  joined by her new baby sibling

Two years ago saw a very sunny portrait for the family (left) and in their latest snap Huahua and her daughters opted for matching outfits
