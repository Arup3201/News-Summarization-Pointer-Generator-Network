A historic mansion perched on a picturesque bluff overlooking the Massachusetts North Shore is on the verge of being swept away by its new owner, the co-creator the Roomba robotic vacuum cleaner.

The Loring House, built in 1881 by a civil war general, was purchased two years ago for $3.75millon by Helen Greiner, of Roomba fame, who is now preparing to tear it down after failing to reach a compromise with preservationists.

The Historic District Commission in the City of Beverly has spent two years trying to convince Ms Greiner, the co-founder of iRobot Corp that manufactures Roomba hoovers, to update the rundown mansion without drastically altering its look.

Landmark: The Loring House was built in 1881 by General Charles G. Loring Jr on a bluff overlooking the Massachussets North Shore in the City of Beverly 

Worse for wear: The house has been vacant for several years and has fallen into disrepair 

Secluded spot: The 130-year-old mansion is hidden from public view and surrounded by trees and shrubbery

Owners: The mansion's first owner, General Loring (left), built the dwelling on land purchased by his father; the current owner of the residence, co-founder of iRobot Helen Greiner (right), is planning to raze it

But Greiner said that the organization has rejected every renovation plan put forward by her design team to make the rambling 130-year-old home more liveable on the grounds that the historical landmark would lose too much of its character.

Pointing a finger of blame at the town’s activists, Ms Geiner, who now holds the position of CEO at CyPhy Works, which develops flying robots, stated to the Boston Globe that she would be moving into Loring House this year if it were not for the staunch opposition from the historic commission. 

But William Finch, the chairman of the historic commission, has claimed that under Greiner's renovation plan, the stately manor overlooking Plum Cove would be completely gutted and fitted with a porch, thus compromising the aesthetic and architectural integrity of the landmark. 

Smart sweeper: iRobot Corp's biggest claim to fame is the robotic vacuum cleaner Roomba 

The Loring House was erected by Charles G Loring Jr, a Civil War general and the first director of the Boston Museum of Fine Arts, on a plot of land in Essex County purchased by his lawyer father in 1844.

The mansion featuring rich wood paneling, winding staircases and impressive fireplaces, was designed by William Ralph Emerson, the cousin of famed poet Ralph Waldo Emerson, and it is considered the finest surviving example of Shingle style architecture.

But the palatial oceanfront nestled in a secluded garden dotted with sculptures on Hale Street has stood vacant for the past several years and has become blighted. 

Helen Greiner, who bought the house in 2012 from members of the Loring clan, had planned to give the dilapidated house a thorough makeover in order to make it habitable again - but town officials feared that the renovation would change the historic mansion too much.

When Greiner came back last year with a plan to demolish Loring House, the Beverly Historic Commission imposed a one-year delay, which expired in April 2014, clearing the way for the iRobt co-founder to raze the landmark to the ground.

‘It’s a tremendous loss to architectural history, and not just to people on the North Shore but to people across the country and all over the world,’ preservationist Bill Cross, of Manchester-by-the-Se, told The Salem News last month. 

A group of private citizens called The Friends of the General Charles G. Loring House tried to raise funds to buy the house from Greiner and donate it to Historic New England, but to no avail.

Tug of war: Ms Greiner had planned to renovate the rambling mansion to make it more livable, but Beverly's preservationists objected to the makeover claiming it would change the character of Loring House  

Period piece: The sprawling 130-year-old private home boasts several imposing fireplaces 

One of a kind: The mansion featuring rich wood paneling and finishes was designed by William Ralph Emerson, and is considered the finest surviving example of Shingle style architecture

Interior design: Activists working to save the mansion have accused Greiner of planning to gut Loring House

Taste for the finer things: Judging by the impressive finishes and decor of Loring House, it is not surprising that General Loring went on to become the first director of the Boston Museum of Fine Arts 

Failed rescue: A group of activists had hoped to raise money to buy Loring House from Greiner and donate it to the town, but to no avail  

Clock is ticking: A one-year demolition delay imposed by the Beverly Historic District Commission expired in April, clearing the way for Greiner to raze the house to the ground 

Peter Loring, whose great-great-grandfather was Charles Loring’s brother, said of his ancestral home that he is going to miss it tremendously.

Mr Loring was among a group of family members who pooled money together and bought the property back from previous owner for $4million in 2009, but they were forced to resell it at a loss to Greiner during the housing crisis.

Ms Greiner said that as far as she is concerned, she had made a good-faith effort to find a middle ground with town officials, but when talks broke down with the preservationist community, she was left with only one option: to tear down the decaying mansion.

‘I’m the only person who actually spent money to save it,’ Greiner said
