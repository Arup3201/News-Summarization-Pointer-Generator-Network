I want it all.

Somewhere hot, but not too hot. Somewhere I can explore, with a room I never have to leave. Somewhere with delicious local cuisine and international delicacies. I want a menu of activities, and a menu for the spa. Somewhere brimming with culture, but only sometimes. And I don’t like children. Well, I do like children. But not on my holiday.

In the past, my holiday experiences have included an array of sulking, strops and – very occasionally – compromise. This is the one time of year when I wish to do whatever I want, whenever I want.

Feeling blue: The Sensatori Crete resort occupies a prime position on the north coast of the island

So can Thomson’s Sensatori resorts save all my problems?

These are places designed for those who cannot make up their mind – or for mixed groups with varying requirements (it is not a prerequisite that guests must have a split-personality disorder and be utterly selfish. That’s just me).

I have ventured to the original Sensatori resort, in Crete.

Upon arrival, the champagne is free-flowing – although possibly only to distract guests from the snaking check-in queue. Ah bubbles, they make annoying things more pleasant.

Come in and splash: The resort has six pools, meaning guests can take a dip at any moment they please

I am inhaled into this alluring atmosphere in quite a different manner from that in which Heraklion airport spat me out. Smooth, calm and – that check-in queue aside – organised.

The lobby hall oozes opulence – marble pillars always do. There is, perhaps unsurprisingly, a Grecian theme to the complex. There is an old-fashioned glamour about the place too. The staircases swoop and spiral, looping inwards down to the lower floors.

The friendly receptionist hands over several bits and bobs, leaflets, key cards and the like. My favourite of these is the VIP card to the private lounge, complete with wifi, waiter service for drinks and a distinct sense of dignity.

Check-in complete, I am led by one of the uniformed team, back out of the main entrance and to a building on the left. In front of me is a pool – one of six, lit up and glowing turquoise in the cool evening air. I wonder if children are allowed in that one.

And here's me, today: Lucy enjoys a moment by the sea (left); the pretty harbour at nearby Heraklion (right)

And if they are not, will I get told off for bombing in?

As I walk to the end of the corridor, I am growing nervous. So far, I have been taken in by the haze of pleasure. It is like my rational self has been clouded with the idea of warm bread rolls and genuine politeness.

No-one is ever this relaxed before reaching their room on holiday. I’m being silly. The sheets are going to be stained, and I’ll be forced to fight each night with the TV remote, which will certainly have a mind of its own. And the shower will blast hot then cold, and never reach a plausible temperature.

Disappointment is nigh.

The key card works! This is usually my first problem. Every hotel. Without fail.

A sense of space: Rooms are generously proportioned, with sparkling sea views

Wait. There’s something over in the corner, distracting me from the actual room. A foreign body? It can’t be. It is! My luggage! It has arrived before me!

I focus on the room. It is beautiful. The modern, slick living space has a chaise-longue, a flat-screen TV and an arrival platter of fruits and wine. It opens onto a balcony that looks over another pool, and the sea. There is a slight covering just in case a little shade is required. Oh, and my favourite part – there is a small private pool up a few discreet steps.

The bedroom is dreamy – as I’m sure my sleep will be. There is another balcony off this ocean-front room. Tomorrow I will wrap up in my fluffy robe and sit right here to watch the sunset. The beach is so quiet and the waters are waving. We’ll see you soon, they say.

I decide to go to the (very) detailed meeting for guests, which help them learn how to ‘Sensatori’.

We are told the term is a concoction of two words. ‘Sense’ refers to the way in which the hotel has (apparently) been designed with the idea of enticing all five senses – smell, taste, hearing touch, sight – in mind.

‘Satori’ is a Japanese word that can loosely translate as having a ‘sudden enlightenment’.

Room for self-improvement: The resort appeals to all five of guests' senses

Perhaps Thomson have set their hopes a little high.

They want me reach enlightenment while smelling aromas, tasting fabulous flavours, hearing sweet sounds, touching, erm, soft things, and seeing beauty.

This seems a lot to ask of a simple holiday. But, (wo)manfully, I get to work.

I follow my nose (let us call this ‘Sense One’) to the first of seven restaurants – the main dining room – for breakfast. I ogle the fresh fruit, pancake station and continental counter, but settle on a naughty pile of bacon and egg on toast. Yum. Taste buds engaged (Sense Two). Stomach largely engorged.

Still deliberating on whether enlightenment will be more imminent if I sit by the beach in my kaftan or in the pool on a lilo, I notice the personal trainer talking to some of the hotel guests.

I peruse the activity timetable. I could wake up for yoga every morning. Well, I could try. It’s certainly nice to have the option, isn’t it? A spot of Downward Dog could be the best way to reach enlightenment. I always have good ideas when upside down.

As evening slides in, I decide to dally with elegance by having dinner at the a la carte restaurant. The food is fine-dining, with live music to set the mood. Resident performers are on hand to sing and keep my ears happy (Sense Three) – in case I become bored of hearing the ocean waves (unlikely).

In the lap of the (Greek) gods: Lucy managed to rouse herself from her sun-lounger on occasion

I find myself drawn to the spa. I do not fight this. My muscles are melted with marjoram and oils by a lovely lady whose fingers are made of magic. The massage soothes my skin (Sense Four), and holds me somewhere between sleep and limbo…

I think I fall asleep. Oh well, at least I’m rested for the night. I am donning my most goddess-like outfit and heading to a local taverna for some grub.

And while I enjoy a gorgeous tomato omelette, tzatziki, meats, fried potato and cheese, I reflect on what Sensatori means. Thomson do not just want to offer a nice hotel. They want it to be a perfect hotel, in a perfect setting, with perfection at every turn. Perfect.

The walk back to the hotel is filled with beautiful sights (let us not forget about Sense Five) – but my favourite thing to look at is the other guests. I don’t think I see one tantrum all week. Not even from the babies. Just pure contentment.

Apparently, there is a new Sensatori resort in Jamaica. My sixth sense is telling me to start saving now.
