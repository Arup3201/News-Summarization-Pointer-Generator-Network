Covered with his 
favourite cuddly toys, the tiny coffin of 17-month-old Gabriel Leblonk -
the youngest victim of  the grenade and gun massacre in Belgium - is 
wheeled out following a moving funeral ceremony.

Tragic Gabriel was shot while in his mother Olivia's arms by crazed gunman 
Nordine Amrani who launched the appalling attack on Christmas shopping crowds in 
Liege's busy Place Saint Lambert.

The 32-year-old convicted criminal, 
who was due to marry his long-term girlfriend, used grenades and a 
semi-automatic rifle to cause carnage in the Belgian city before turning
a revolver on himself.

Tragic: Baby Gabriel died at just 17 months after being shot in the back of the head while in his mother's arms

Distraught Olivia
described the terrible moment when she first realised her son had been 
shot and how he was finally baptised after doctors had battled for 10 
hours to save his life.

She had gone shopping to the Christmas market on Tuesday morning with husband Romuald and their son.

She said: 'Romuald
handed me the baby when I got off the bus. So I had him in my arms when
I heard a sound of gunfire followed by flash of light like lightning.

'I looked at my child and his eyes returned my look. I screamed. He had been wounded in the back of the head.

She then said: 'My child's eyes were rolled back.'

The bullet, from a military style-assault rifle was lodged in her baby’s head near the neck.

'They
could not remove it, it was too risky. They told me he had an hour 
left. I warned the family. Everyone came to say goodbye,' she said.

Quiet dignity: A silent march took place in Liege to pay tribute to the victims of the attack. Four people were killed and more than 120 were injured in the rampage

Yesterday as Belgium continued its struggle to come to terms
with the killings, thousands took to the streets to join a silent march 
and memorial service.

Defence
lawyer Jean-Francois Dister said Amrani, a Belgian from a Moroccan 
background, was on parole and was due to answer a summons about 
allegedly ‘sexually molesting’  a young woman.

He is thought to have attacked the unnamed victim after driving alongside her in his van. Its number plate was captured by CCTV.

‘What worried him most was to be 
jailed again. According to my client it was a set-up by people who 
wanted to harm him. Mr Amrani had a grudge against the law.

'He thought he had been wrongfully convicted.’

After
Tuesday’s attack, the bag Amrani used to carry his haul of weapons was 
found to still contain several loaded magazines, as well as a number of 
live grenades.

An 
enquiry has been launched into why he had not been under closer 
supervision while on bail after early release from a sentence of nearly 
five years. 

Devastated: The attack brought horror to Belgium's fifth largest city, with crowds of shoppers, many of them children, screaming and running in panic as grenades exploded and shots rang out

United: Crowds took to the streets to show their grief for the victims of the attack

One of Amrani’s numerous previous convictions was for rape, for which he had been given a two-year suspended sentence in 2003.

If convicted again for a sex crime, he would have had to serve it.

This would have also meant his girlfriend, a nurse called Perrin Balon, finding out about the sex allegations against him.

‘He feared being returned to prison,’said Mr Dister. ‘He called me twice on Monday afternoon and on Tuesday morning about it.

His weapons were confiscated because 
of his other criminal offences, yet he managed to obtain a FAL Belgian 
assault rifle, grenades and other weapons soon after his release in 
October 2010.

Belgian’s 
notoriously liberal criminal justice system is already facing questions 
as to why, in October 2010, the killer had been released from prison 
three years early after being convicted of firearms and drug offences.

In
2008 he had been found guilty of keeping 10 complete firearms, and an 
astonishing 9,500 gun parts in his flat, along with 2,800 cannabis 
plants nearby.

On 
Tuesday morning, Amrani is thought to have tried to rape the woman 
cleaner in his flat, where police had found an arsenal of weapons 
including a rocket launcher, AK47 and Kalashnikov.

Police said he killed her 'with a 
bullet to her head' and then dumped her body in a lock-up shed where he 
was growing cannabis plants.

Killer: Amrani's lawyer said he carried out the attack because he feared being sent to back to prison for a sex crime.

He then left money for Ms Balon, with a note that said: 'Good luck! I love you.'

A
police source said: 'The cleaner had been working in a neighbour's 
home. It appears that Amrani had invited her into his own flat to 
discuss the possibility of cleaning his flat.

'There were signs of a struggle, and it may be that Amrani had tried to rape her.

'Whatever happened, she was undoubtedly his first murder victim on Tuesday morning.'

Cedric Visart Bocarme, the Belgian 
Attorney General, confirmed that the woman 'would have been murdered by 
the killer just before he went to Place Saint-Lambert'.

The attack brought horror to Belgium's
fifth largest city, with crowds of shoppers, many of them children, 
screaming and running in panic as grenades exploded and shots rang out.

Abdelhadi Amrani, another lawyer who worked for the killer but is not related, said he had grown up in foster homes after being orphaned as a child.

‘I remember a man deeply marked by the loss of his parents,’ said Ms Amrani. ‘He lost his father and mother very early. He was marked by fate.

‘I would add he was a very smart boy, gifted. 'Nordine often spoke of his desire to start a family. He was to be married to a nurse in Liege.’

Commenting on Amrani’s background, Ms Amrani said: ‘He did not feel at all Moroccan. He did not speak a word of Arabic, and was not Muslim. What he said is that he felt like a Belgian.

Stopped in his tracks: A body, thought to be gunman Nordine Amrani, lies on the pavement close to a gun and full clips of ammunition.

‘He was crazy about weapons, but as a collector.

'He felt he had not had much luck in life and felt unfairly treated by the courts.

'This was the fed-up cry of a tormented soul – he was estranged from justice, and against society.’

A 17-month-old baby boy called Gabriel became the fourth victim after dying in hospital late on Tuesday night despite undergoing hours of emergency treatment.

Gabriel was in the arms of his mother when he was hit by a bullet in the back of the head. The child and his parents were at the bus stop just below the walkway from where Amrani opened fire.

Amrani had been due to attend a police interview in the late morning but never showed up.

Instead he left his apartment armed with a Belgian-made FN- FAL automatic rifle, a handgun and up to a dozen grenades carried in a backpack.

He drove the five-minute journey from his 1930s apartment building the Residence Belvedere and parked his white van in Place St Lambert.

He walked on to a raised walkway above a bus stop where lunchtime shoppers were thronging for the opening of a Christmas market.

From his 15ft high vantage point he lobbed three hand grenades towards a busy bus shelter before opening fire on the crowd. A 15-year-old boy died instantly while the baby of 17 months and a 17-year-old boy succumbed to their injuries in hospital.
