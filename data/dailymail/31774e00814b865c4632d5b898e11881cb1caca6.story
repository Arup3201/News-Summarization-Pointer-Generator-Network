He's making his comeback as a boxer at age 62 against a man less than half his age.

But luckily Mickey Rourke is still in fighting shape, as demonstrated by an open training session on Wednesday in Moscow, Russia.

The celebrated actor was looking lean and mean as he hit the pads in nothing but tiny white briefs with the help of boxing coach Marvin Somodio, who is legendary trainer Freddie Roach's assistant.

Back in the day: Rourke was a professional boxer before he took up a career in acting. He began at the age of 12 and made a brief comeback to the ring in 1991 before hanging up his boxing gloves in 1994

The actor was an amateur boxer before his Hollywood career took off and he became a sex symbol star in films such as '9 1/2 Weeks.'

He returned to boxing as a professional for eight matches in the 1990s, causing damage to his face that necessitated surgery and changed his appearance.

In 2008 he starred in The Wrestler about a washed-up fighter making a comeback, winning a Golden Globe for best actor.
