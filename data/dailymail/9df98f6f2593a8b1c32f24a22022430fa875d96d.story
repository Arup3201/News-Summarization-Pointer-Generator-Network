A team-mate of a footballer jailed for raping a drunken teenager  provoked outrage last night by branding the victim a ‘money-grabbing  little tramp’.

As Welsh international Ched Evans began a five-year sentence, fellow Sheffield United player Connor Brown posted an extraordinary rant on Twitter.

After branding the law ‘a load of ****ing ***t’, the 19-year-old wrote: ‘I’m with you geez’ and made his extraordinary attack on the victim.

International star: Sheffield United and Wales player Evans in action against Chesterfield last month. He has been jailed for five years

Shortly afterwards he added: ‘If ur a 
slag ur a slag don’t try get money from being a slag [sic]... Stupid 
girls... I feel sick.’

The offensive posts were later removed
from the profile, which features a photograph of Brown signing a 
Sheffield United shirt for a fan.

Evans, 23, was his club’s top scorer 
with 29 League goals this season, and was named League One Player of the
Month in March. He was yesterday convicted of raping the 19-year-old 
woman at a hotel after a night out in Rhyl, North Wales, last May.

The victim had told police she had no memory of the incident and believed her drink may have been spiked.

Outburst: Connor Brown made the comments on Twitter

Evans’s friend, the Port Vale defender Clayton McDonald, was found not guilty of the same charge.

Their trial heard Evans had told 
police the footballers could have had ‘any girl we wanted’ at the 
nightclub where they had spent the evening.

‘We are footballers, that’s how it is,’ he told them. ‘Footballers are rich, they have got money, that’s what the girls like.’ 

Evans and McDonald had been out 
partying the night before the Bank Holiday last May and had booked a 
room at the resort’s Premier Inn, the trial at Caernarfon Crown Court 
heard.

The girl, who they had earlier seen 
falling over in a kebab shop after drinking wine, double vodkas with 
lemonade and a sambuca shot, approached McDonald, and the pair took a 
taxi to his hotel.

When Evans arrived in the room, he 
found the pair having sex, and claimed McDonald asked if he wanted to 
have sex with her too. Evans said the girl was ‘in control’ and he 
admitted having sex with her as a friend and Evans’s brother tried to 
film them through a window.

The girl awoke the next morning, naked
and alone in the hotel bedroom. She told police the last thing she 
could remember was being in a takeaway shop.

Jailing Evans, of Penistone, South 
Yorkshire, for five years, Judge Merfyn Hughes QC told him he must have 
realised the girl was ‘intoxicated’ and in no condition to agree to sex.
He said Evans had thrown away his ‘successful career’.

Afterwards, Evans’s lawyers said: 
‘Ched Evans is shocked and extremely disappointed with the decision 
reached today. Mr Evans firmly maintains his innocence in this matter 
and is being advised regarding an appeal of the decision.’

Sheffield United said the club recognised ‘the seriousness of these events’. It refused to comment on Brown’s Twitter posts.
