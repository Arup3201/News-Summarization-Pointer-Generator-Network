Facebook doesn't 'like' when its users create fake profiles, even if those users happen to be Drug Enforcement Administration agents investigating a crime.

That is the message that the ubiquitous social media site sent to the federal agency this week.

Facebook's chief security officer, Joe Sullivan, wrote in a letter Friday to DEA Administrator Michele Leonhart that law enforcement agencies need to follow the same rules about being truthful on Facebook as civilian users.

Unfriend: Facebook sent a letter to the Drug Enforcement Administration demanding that its agents stop creating fake profile pages, which is on violation of the site's code of conduct 

Those rules include a ban on lying about who you are on Facebook.

Sullivan's letter was in response to an upstate New York woman's federal lawsuit claiming that a DEA agent created a fake online persona using her name and photographs stored on her cellphone.

In court filings, Sondra Arquiett said her pictures were retrieved from her cellphone after she was arrested in July 2010 on drug charges and her device seized.

Arquiett said the fake profile page was being used by DEA agent Timothy Sinnigen to interact with ‘dangerous individuals he was investigating’ for at least three months. 

Arquiett is asking for $250,000 in damages for using her photos, including 'revealing' images and snapshots of her children. 

‘Facebook has long made clear that law enforcement authorities are subject to these policies,’ Sullivan wrote. ‘We regard DEA's conduct to be a knowing and serious breach of Facebook's terms and policies.’

Facebook also wants the DEA to provide them with assurances that it has stopped using any other fake profile pages it may have created.

‘The department has launched a review into the incident at issue in this case,’ Justice Department spokesman Brian Fallon said in response to a request for comment. ‘That review is ongoing, but to our knowledge, this is not a widespread practice among our federal law enforcement agencies.’

The Justice Department initially defended the practice, arguing in an August court filing that while Arquiett didn't directly authorize Sinnigen to create the fake account, she ‘implicitly consented by granting access to the information stored in her cellphone and by consenting to the use of that information to aid in ... ongoing criminal investigations.’

Last week, the agency announced it would review whether the Facebook ruse went too far.

The case was scheduled to go to trial this week, but court records show it has been sent to mediation.
