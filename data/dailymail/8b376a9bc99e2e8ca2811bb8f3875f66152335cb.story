Offerring a shy smile from behind mum’s cheek, Florence Rose Endellion Cameron is the star of Number 10’s official Christmas card, ready to be sent to world leaders and dignitaries.

Captured by award-winning photographer Tom Stoddart, the picture shows the Camerons’ youngest child gripping her father’s neck while she snuggles against her mother.

It is striking that the three-year-old features so prominently because David Cameron has closely guarded his children’s privacy since moving to Number 10 and usually requests that all photographs of them are pixelated.

Greeting: Prime Minister David Cameron and his wife Samantha photographed with daughter Florence at 10 Downing Street for their 2013 Christmas card

It is the second time Florence has taken centre stage on the PM’s card, after appearing in 2010 just months after her birth.

More than 2,000 cards have been printed for the Prime Minister to send in the coming weeks.

However, he will not sign them all personally and many will be pre-printed with his signature.

Mr Cameron has opted for a photograph of himself and wife Samantha each year since taking power in 2010, when they chose the photograph of the couple holding baby Florence on the steps of Number 10.

Baby Florence Rose Endellion Cameron also appeared on the Prime Minister's card in 2010

In 2011 it was a photograph taken during a street party to mark the Royal Wedding, and last year they were seen welcoming the Olympic flame to Downing Street on the eve of the London Games.

This year’s card rounds off a year when young Florence has often made the news.

Mr Cameron has spoken of his desire to take her to nursery in Westmister as often as possible and is often pictured leaving Number 10 carrying scooters, dolls and buggies.

In July Florence was rushed to hospital after getting a sticker trapped up her nose.

Doctors at St Thomas’ in London removed the sticker after her concerned parents’ unsuccessful attempts to do so at their Downing Street flat.

This week Alex Salmond revealed his official Christmas card, an imposing artwork of the fourth wise man who 
turned up too late to see Jesus.

Festive? This painting of the fourth wise man Artaban by Peter Howson will grace the front of the First Minister Alex Salmond's 2013 charity Christmas card

The Scottish First Minister has opted for the bleak, sinewy painting of Artaban by Scottish artist Peter Howson.

The
artwork will be sold to raise money for charity, but some questioned 
whether its choice for a Christmas card was not very festive.

Since 2007 Mr Salmond 
has raised £148,000 for charities in Scotland through sales of the 
original artwork and limited edition prints of his official card.

Today
he unveiled the Howson painting, which will be sold at auction in the 
New Year with the proceeds shared between the Children's Hospice 
Association Scotland (Chas), CLIC Sargent, Scottish Catholic 
International Aid Fund (Sciaf) and Combat Stress, the charity chosen by 
the artist.

He insisted the image of Artaban is a ‘hugely appropriate’ work for his card.

Mr Salmond said: ‘The legend of 
Artaban, or the fourth wise man, is based on a novel by Henry van Dyke. 
It tells the tale of a Persian scholar who, delayed by helping the 
vulnerable, follows the star to Bethlehem but arrives just too late to 
herald the birth of the Christ child.

‘Thirty years on in Jerusalem, at Passover, Artaban is still searching.

‘Now
an old man, he parts with the last of his three gifts to Jesus, a 
sapphire, a ruby and a pearl, to save a young girl from slavery. 
However, in a dying vision, Artaban is comforted that his devotion to 
the distressed has secured him entrance to the kingdom of heaven.

‘The story reminds us that hope, faith and self-sacrifice are at the centre of the order of things.
