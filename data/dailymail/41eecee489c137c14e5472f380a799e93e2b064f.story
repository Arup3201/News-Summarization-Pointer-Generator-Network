Manchester City midfielder Jack Rodwell is at Sunderland's training ground ahead of his permanent switch to the Stadium of Light.

Despite City’s lack of homegrown talent, Rodwell can leave the Etihad Stadium this summer after failing to make an impact on Manuel Pellegrini.

Sunderland are in advanced talks with City over a move for the 23-year-old midfielder, who is set to pen a five-year deal.

City value Rodwell, who signed from Everton in the summer of 2012, at £10million.

And Rodwell is due in the north-east later on Monday to thrash out personal terms to join Gus Poyet’s side.

Despite developing a reputation as one of England’s most promising midfielders, Rodwell’s career has stagnated at City.

He played just 10 games for City last season as he found first-team football hard to come by at the Etihad.

As well as this Rodwell has only started seven Premier League games for the champions since his move two years ago.

But Poyet believes he can put Rodwell’s career back on track next season.
