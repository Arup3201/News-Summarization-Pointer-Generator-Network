The manhunt for the suspect and his female accomplice, pictured, first began after an armed carjacking was  reported on Lookout Mountain, west of Golden, Colorado

The deputy radioed that the male suspect was armed with a rifle and a handgun, which was confirmed by the sheriff's office.

ABC 7 Denver's chopper arrived on the scene and spotted the man dressed in dark jeans, a black tank top, and a baseball cap walking through the woods.

A blonde-haired woman also wearing black and carrying a black backpack could be seen walking behind the man.

The woman became separated from the man and was arrested around 4.15pm

The man continued on and tried to steal two dump trucks but was unsuccessful

She became separated from the male suspect and was was arrested by police without incident at 4:15 p.m. along U.S. Highway 40 near Mount Vernon Road, ABC reports.

However, the male suspect continued on his crime spree.

First, he walked into a highway maintenance facility and entered the cabs of two dump trucks, attempting to steal them, before walking away without success.

After failing to start the dump trucks, at 4:17 p.m., he is seen entering a nearby home and then smashing a stolen car out of a closed garage door.

He then entered this nearby home, stole and SUV and crashed it through the garage door

The suspect drove the SUV for a short time but ended up at a dead end and continued on foot

The suspect drove a short distance down a dirt road to the end of a dead-end next to Interstate 70.

That's when he tried to stop vehicles on the interstate by waving his rifle at drivers.

At least one vehicle slowed and then sped off before potentially being carjacked.

At that point, Jefferson County Sheriff's Office veteran officer Deputy Fred Haggett engaged him.

The cop pulls a gun on the carjacker as he runs towards a car

He then attempted again to highjack a car after pointing his rifle at motorists

Haggett 
can be seen on the video speeding down the highway pointing his service 
revolver at the gunman who continued to try and stop passing cars.

The suspect then laid down his rifle but refused to surrender, again attempting to evade police by running down the interstate.

He
 was finally grabbed and captured by the motorcycle deputy and thrown to
 the pavement where a brave motorist helped pin him down until backup 
arrived.

He finally appears to surrender then again runs away from police before he is taken down by the hero cop

He then grabs a hold of his shirt to stop him running off
