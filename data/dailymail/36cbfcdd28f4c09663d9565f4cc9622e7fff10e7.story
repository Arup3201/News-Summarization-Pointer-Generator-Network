'The tendency now is to consider drugs or operations as a quick fix if you are overweight', said Dr Ellie Cannon on the Lorraine show this morning.

And a quick fix is exactly what Emrah Mevsimler was desperate for when he begged his mother Sharon for a gastric band operation at the age of just 13.

'I had tried to kill myself,' he told presenter Helen Fospero. 'I begged her to have the operation to change my life.'

Emrah Mevsimler calls on obese teenagers to opt for exercise and healthy eating

Emrah, from Chelmsford, Essex, is now 18 and says he wants the procedure reversed.

'Over the years it stopped working and now it's causing me so much 
trouble.

'I get in extreme unbearable pain which stops me from standing up.

It's like really bad cramp that won't go away.'

He now wants to warn other teenagers not to go down the same route as he did.

'Exercise should be the way - and schools should help. Fitness should be a priority.'

Emrah became the youngest person in the UK to have a gastric band fitted in 2008.

His family decided to take the drastic action after constant bullying about his weight led to a suicide attempt.

His mother had spent most of her life struggling with her weight too and at one point had been dubbed Britain's most obese woman.

Emrah said: 'The bullying was really bad, I couldn't 
stand it,' he said. 'A gastric band was the only way at the time, what 
they said was ruining my life.'

'I turned to food for comfort. After I
 finished school, if I had money, I'd go and buy loads of sweets, go 
home, eat them then cry.'

At his heaviest, Emrah tipped the scales at 16 stone 8lbs at just 13 years old

'Before I had my gastric band it was a
 very difficult time for me at age 13. I tried to commit suicide, I 
begged mum to have the operation to change my life.'

'She definitely realised she wanted to see me happy and not have to go through what she went through.

'At the time it was fantastic. I lost
 weight, was so happy, regained my confidence, started socialising and 
made loads of new friends.'

Emrah's story first hit the headlines in 2010 after the death of his mother Sharon.

Now aged 18, Emrah wishes he could turn 
back the clock and is desperate to have the band removed to end the pain
 he experiences daily.

Emrah, a careworker for disabled children, has lived in almost constant agony for the past few years since he earned the dubious accolade of being the youngest person in the UK to be fitted with a gastric band.

The controversial operation, which made national headlines, was performed in 2007 when he was only 13 and weighed 16st 8lb.

Despite losing 4 stone in weight, the teenager is now calling for a worldwide ban on children having drastic anti‑obesity procedures.

‘I just wish it was out of me,’ he says. ‘I’ve been through hell because of it. I think every doctor should refuse to do them on anyone under 18. A gastric band is not the answer to curing an overweight child.’

Last year it was revealed that up to 20 children as young as 15 had invasive weight-loss surgery on the NHS in Britain. Added to this is the undocumented number of British children whose parents pay for the procedure privately, at a cost of between £5,000 and £8,000.

Many more children travel abroad with their parents to seek out cheap deals. Like Emrah, who had his operation in Belgium, many of these children haven’t even completed puberty when they go under the knife.

The World Health Organisation has expressed concern over the use of bands in young people.

Last year, a WHO report warned there had been little research into the use of these techniques on children, with their unique metabolic needs, concluding: ‘Surgical complications in this age group remain a concern.’

Gastric band surgery involves fitting a band near the top of the stomach, restricting the amount of food that can enter, thus making the patient feel full. Follow-up operations can adjust how much food is allowed to pass through.

On Lorraine this morning, Dr Ellie Cannon, who joined Emrah on the sofa, said: 'A gastric band
 is very much a last resort. Emrah is a very unusual case to have had 
the operation at his age.'

'There is very strict criteria in the UK. Though the tendency now is to consider drugs or operations a 'quick fix' if you're overweight,
 actually Emrah's story shows although it worked for him if we can teach
 children and parents about lifestyle and exercise - although it's a 
longer process - they'll be better off in the long term.'

When Helen Fospero asked about Emrah's prospects if he has the band removed, whether he would be able to retain his figure, Dr Cannon said: 'Hopefully the behavioural change will stay and he should be able to carry that on.'
