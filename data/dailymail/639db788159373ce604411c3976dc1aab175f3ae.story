Defence chiefs spent £28 million of taxpayers' cash last year on an army of private lawyers to fight legal claims against the military.

The rise of human rights legislation and the number of cases being brought means cash which should pay for weapons and equipment is going to lawyers.

Defence Minister Anna Soubry revealed the amount spent on external lawyers in the Treasury Solicitors Department, barristers and private legal work.

But the MoD admits real spending on lawyers is likely to be much higher because the figures does not include the cost of legal work commissioned separately by the Army, Royal Navy and RAF, the Service Prosecuting Authority or for legal advice in foreign countries.

Troops have suffered a pay freeze, recruiting has been cut and thousands of personnel have been sacked as commanders try to fill a £28billion budget black hole.

Defence sources there is a growing number of compensation claims submitted by injured troops and foreign nationals claiming they are victims of abuse and torture.

As well as using private lawyers, the MoD employs 190 lawyers, more than at any time in its history.

One senior officer last night said: ‘Spending on lawyers is the only growth area in the Armed Forces.’

Last year the military was inundated with more than 5,827 legal suits. Since 2005, more than 36,500 compensations claims were brought by members of the Armed Forces and their families. Many have been for compensation for battle wounds sustained in Iraq and Afghanistan.

An MoD spokesman said: ‘We are having to spend taxpayers’ money defending the department and our military personnel.'

There has been a rise in cases put down partly to human rights legislation

Costs could be far higher because they do not count individual services
