Paramedics drafted in from around the country to cover staff shortages at a scandal-hit ambulance trust are camping in tents because their poor pay means they can't afford to stay in hotels. 

Many of the agency staff working at East of England Ambulance Service Trust, which has previously come under fire for its poor record at saving lives, live in other parts of the country.

But they are given just £35 extra a day on top of their £10.50-an-hour wage to cover the living expenses of working away from home.

This has forced many of the medics temporarily working for the trust to camp as they cannot afford the cost of hotels or BnBs.

Temporary home: Agency paramedics drafted in to help with staff shortages at the East of England Ambulance Service Trust have been staying at a £15-a-night campsite in Brampton, Cambridgeshire, because their £35 daily living allowance means they can't afford a hotel

Four paramedics - two men and two women - are currently staying in three tents at the Willows campsite in Brampton, Cambridgeshire.

The two women are sharing one tent and the two men are in individual tents with each pitch costing £15 per night.

They have been recruited on behalf of the ambulance trust by health service contractor ERS Medical.

The company said its £35 allowance was 'above the industry norm' and described the camp site as 'great' for their emergency workers.

But union leaders said the allowance - to cover food and board while working away - was not enough.

Staff are understood to have been using the campsite for the past six weeks, alongside holidaying families who were stunned to see front-line NHS staff living 'rough'.

The East of England Ambulance Service Trust service has come under fire for its poor record at saving lives

Holidaymaker Eve Firmin said: 'We were very shocked to see that it was ambulance people that were staying in the tents here.

'We had no idea until we saw one of them come back quite late, make a cup of tea, then head straight to bed.'

Health minister Dr Dan Poulter, whose constituency is served by the ambulance trust, said it was no way to look after workers meant to save lives.

He said: 'It's something I find very difficult to accept as being good conditions in which to house staff who have patients' lives in their hands.

'This is clearly something the ambulance trust will want to look at immediately as they are responsible for assigning contracts - and they need to do so.'

Cambridge Lib-Dem MP Julian Huppert, whose constituency covers the campsite, described the situation as 'astonishing'.

He said: 'The contractors charge a 
fair whack, I suspect, for the staff, so I would expect they would be 
able to make sure they were able to afford to stay somewhere comfortable
while they're working.

Criticism: The agency responsible for recruiting the paramedics has come under fire for forcing 'front-line staff who have patients' lives on their hands' to live in campsites

'Camping can be fun, but it's not great if you have a very late night and want to unwind.

'I think the agency should look very carefully at how much support it's giving its own staff.'

A spokesman who represents ambulance workers in the GMB Union said that contractors like ERS have a responsibility to house staff properly.

Regional organiser Tony Hughes said: 'ERS have to make sure they have the right resources to do the job.

'The £35 a night figure clearly isn't enough and they need to change the figure.

'It could affect your work if you don't sleep properly, and there's also the hygiene aspect - how well can they shower and keep clean if they go home to a camp site?'

But ERS say they have received good feedback on the camp site.

An ERS spokesman said: 'We always provide suitable financial support to ensure that all crews have sufficient rest between shifts.

Positive feedback: ERS, a health service contractor who recruited the paramedics on behalf of the trust, said the Willows Caravan Park near Brampton in Cambridgeshire was 'great' for their staff

'We have specifically questioned our 
crews as to the suitability of the campsite and have received 
unequivocal responses that say it's a great site with appropriate 
facilities and that they enjoy good sleep and comfort. They are not at 
risk.'

The East of England Ambulance Service Trust said: 'The quality of our service delivery is of utmost importance so before working in partnership with us, private ambulance organisations must undergo a thorough trust-accredited process and meet stringent criteria.

'Those who are employed by the private ambulance services are qualified to recognised NHS standard.'

Paramedics working for the contractor are paid £10.50 an hour - roughly equivalent to a £21,000-a-year salary.

A Premier Inn near the camp site has a starting rate of £57, while the camp site costs just £15 per tent pitch.

Campsite manager Ray Jackson said: 'The ambulance workers are no different to the other contractors here - we've had electricians, joiners and demolition men who all prefer camping to a B&B.

'It's up to then how they use their allowance.'
