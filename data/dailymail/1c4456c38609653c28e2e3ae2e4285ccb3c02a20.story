A wife has defied odds of a million-to-one after discovering she is a perfect kidney match for her husband.

Polly Ernest, 47, is giving husband Roger Fuller the ‘biggest gift ever’ by donating her organ to save him from a lifetime of dialysis.

She made a promise to Roger nearly 20 years ago when he was first diagnosed with polycystic kidneys - a hereditary disease - that she would donate a kidney to him if he needed it.

But it was not until 2009 when Roger’s health started to deteriorate that he even considered the idea.

Father-of-five Roger, 65, from Hereford, said: 'I never ever thought I would actually take Polly up on her offer. I never even contemplated needing it but reality has a way of coming round.

'It is the biggest gift she could ever give me. There are not many other parts of the human body one can spare.

'It is pretty unusual for strangers to be a match so it’s even rarer for a husband and wife to be compatible. It is a remarkable thing to even contemplate.'

However Polly, who works with her husband as book sellers, played down her generosity candidly declaring ‘I only need one kidney’.

'I have got two kidneys and you only need one - it was as simple as that,' she said.

'If you have got something and by giving something you can help someone else why would I not do it? I had no idea about how unusual it is for a husband and wife to be a match.'

Company director Roger continued: 'Since going for dialysis over the last year I really seriously considered what was going on and that’s when the promise came back up.

'There is a risk for Polly, nobody is denying that. The children are old enough to know what is going on and they don’t like it really because it takes mum out of the house and they are aware of the fact that these sort of things can go terribly wrong.

'But they see the benefit that we can be much more spontaneous in our lives. It is a gift to me and it is also a gift for the family. We are a family and we support each other.'

Polly had to consider keeping her kidney in case one of her children needed it when they are older as it is likely some will have the condition.

She added: 'I had to think about my children or Roger. But by the time they would need it the organ will be old and hopefully a transplant won’t be necessary by then because it should be a curable condition.'

The couple, who have three sons and two daughters, lived near Montpellier in France for four-and-a-half years before they moved back to Herefordshire last year.

Roger has been having dialysis three times a week, with each session lasting four hours, since September 2009. Roger said they had put their lives on hold since then.

The operation has been cancelled four times so couple are eager for it to go ahead. It is scheduled to take place at the Queen Elizabeth Hospital in Birmingham during the first week of April.

'The first six months will be harder, it will be tougher because he will more incapacitated than he currently is but after that he should be able to go on holiday, which will be really nice,' Polly said.

'It will be really nice to be able to be spontaneous again.'

Professor Neil Turner, Chairman of Kidney Research UK, said: 'For kidney patients in need of a transplant, there’s a strong chance that their parents, siblings or children will be a perfect match, because they are directly related.

'However, the chances of receiving a good match from a non-related living donor, such as a friend or spouse, are around one in a million.

'With 7,000 people in the UK currently awaiting a kidney transplant, we desperately need more people to join the organ donor register.

'We also need more research aimed at improving the lifespan of transplanted kidneys, which currently only last around 10 to 15 years before needing to be replaced.'
