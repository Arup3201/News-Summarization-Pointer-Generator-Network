Not everyone is a naturally gifted musician - but a new invention means you no longer need to be to play a note-perfect solo on the violin.

Technology lecturer Dylan Menzies has created the O-Bow, which translates data from an optical sensor and keyboard into violin music.

The optical flow sensor monitors the speed and angle of a bow when it is moved across indented grooves on the top of it - much like drawing a bow across an actual violin.

Hitting the right notes: The O-Bow has an optical flow sensor which is 'played' with a real violin bow while a keyboard is used to choose the notes

Pitch perfect: O-Bow inventor Dylan Menzies believes that experienced keyboard players could learn how to use his system within a few minutes

A keyboard connected to the sensor is used to play the notes and choose the pitch of the music.

Combined, this means the user can create music that sounds just like a violin is being played - without the need for years of practice.

Multi-talented: Dylan Menzies is a technology lecturer at De Montford University but also a passionate keyboard and sax player

Mr Menzies, who is a lecturer at De Montfort University, told Wired.co.uk: 'I at one time had an obsession with Sibelius' Violin Concerto, and realised I was never going to be able to play something like that on a real violin - I'm a keyboard/sax player.

'That got me thinking about why a violin is hard, and could it be easier but still expressive? I was aware of various commercial and research devices, but nothing seemed to address the problem of electronic bowing as an instrument in its own right, rather than an effect or add-on.'

The software can be used to create a 
variety of sounds including ringing - the term given to describe the 
sound made when a bow is removed part way through playing.

It can also produce vibrato, which is a pulsating technique created by shaking the wrist.

The lecturer believes a good keyboard player can learn how to use his system in just a few minutes.

He
added: 'A week of practicing, you can sound pretty good. I don't think I
have mastered it yet; there is a lot of potential, even for expression 
that is impossible on a real stringed instrument.'

Mr Menzies has produced five prototypes and may eventually bring the instrument to market.

Mr Menzies has built other laterntive instruments - including the CyberWhistle, a penny whistle modified with a windcontroller to emulate wind instruments.
