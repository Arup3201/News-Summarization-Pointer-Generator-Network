French president Francois Hollande has been dumped by his glamorous mistress Julie Gayet

French president Francois Hollande has been dumped by his glamorous mistress Julie Gayet, it has been claimed.

The actress has allegedly told friends she was unable to cope with the media pressure of being the president’s girlfriend.

Hollande, 59, split with former First Lady and partner of ten years Valerie Trierweiler after he was caught making late night visits to actress Ms Gayet in January.

Revelations of the president’s cheating in glossy Closer magazine sent 49-year-old Ms Trierweiler into hospital for a week suffering from shock.

But his love affair with Ms Gayet, 41, has now ‘unravelled’, France’s Gala magazine reported.

It said that according a friend of Ms Gayet: 'As an actress she may be used to public attention, but with Mr Hollande it became too much for her.'

The magazine also blamed the return to the cabinet of Segolene Royal - Hollande’s partner of 30 years and mother of his four children - for the break up.

The former 2007 presidential candidate was appointed environment minister earlier this months after five years in the political wilderness.

Meanwhile, a new book released last week has claimed Mr Hollande is ‘missing’ Ms Trierweiler and becoming attached to the former journalist once again.

The book called ‘The President who Wanted to Live his Lives’, by journalist Elise Karlin, claims that the president remains ‘tender and considerate’ towards his ex-partner.

It says Mr Hollande even bought Ms Trierweiler flowers when they met for a meal at one of their favourite restaurants in Paris last month.

The book claims the president ‘hates solitude’ and has given the impression his feelings for her are ‘far from extinguished’.

Friends have also been quoted as saying he is almost ‘harassing’ her with tender text messages.

However, the book also alleges that Ms Trierweiler expects a public act of contrition on his part before any reconciliation.

But it also hints the president may have the ulterior motive of trying to stop Ms Trierweiler from writing her own tell-all book about their break-up.
