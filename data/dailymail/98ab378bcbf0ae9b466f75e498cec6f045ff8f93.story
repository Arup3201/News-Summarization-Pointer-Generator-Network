John Anthony Lane was arrested in Malia after being chased down by a mob on the beach

A British man was detained by Greek police after furious locals accused him of taking photographs of children on a beach.

Holidaymaker John Anthony Lane was chased by an angry mob before being held to the ground near a beach in Malia, Crete.

The drama unfolded moments after the 51-year-old was challenged by a suspicious parent of a ten-year-old, according to eyewitnesses.

When police arrived, they looked at his camera and made the arrest, holding him in jail for five days before he appeared in court charged with taking indecent pictures of children.

After the hearing yesterday, at which he was told to pay £3,208 in bail money before being released, Mr Lane told The Mirror: ‘I’m innocent.

'I’ve been in prison for five days. I’m frightened and I just want to go home.’

He was seen visiting a string of cash machines with his lawyer on the holiday island to withdraw the money to pay bail, it is believed.

The newspaper reports that the money will be given back to him if he goes back for trial at the island’s capital Heraklion.

But under Greek law he does not have to return in which case the cash will be forfeited and the case will be closed.

The 51-year-old was bailed after paying more than £3,000 which will be returned if he agrees to face trial on the holiday island at a later date

Eyewitnesses
 told the paper that a mother suspected he was taking pictures of her 
young daughter before the woman asked to examine his camera.

In the moments that followed, locals gave chase and took the camera off him.

The
 Mirror reports that police raided Mr Lane’s hotel room on Malia’s main 
strip and have made contact with Interpol to have his Birmingham home 
investigated.
