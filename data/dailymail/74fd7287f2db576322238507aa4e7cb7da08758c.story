Parents in a Danish town have agreed to spend more time in the bedroom in a bid to have more children so they can save the area's closure threatened schools.

The institutions in the town of Thy in northwestern Jutland have dwindling pupil numbers due to low birth rates.

Locals were eager to keep their local facilities such as community daycare centres and schools after being warned they would have to be closed or merged with others in the area.

So as part of a deal, local authority Thisted Council has agreed to keep the institutions open for the next four years if parents promise to create new children to fill their places.

It came after parents pleaded with the authority to keep the schools open.

Council spokeswoman Ulla Vestergaard told broadcaster DR: 'When it comes to partnership deals, it’s all about cooperating with many local actors to build up a synergy.

'It’s a cooperation, and not just with the parents. We need to get the falling birth rates turned around.'

She added that politicians would actively try to stop people from moving away from the area if the parents kept up their end of the deal.

Estate agents and banks in the area also promised to convince people to stay in the town. 

The deal comes after it was revealed that birth rates across Denmark are continuing to drop as women put off having children until they are older.

This has prompted the Danish Family Planning Association to teach youngsters the importance of not leaving it too late to have children as part of sex education in schools.

The average age of a first time parent in Denmark is 29, which is five years older than it was in 1970.
