Threats: The escalation of strike action comes as the rift with Education Secretary Michael Gove deepens

Militant teachers yesterday announced a major escalation of strike action which is set to close thousands of schools this term.  

Members of the National Union of Teachers will walk out on July 10 as a bitter rift with Education Secretary Michael Gove deepens.  

They will be joined by union members who work in education and local government as Unison, GMB and Unite plan to co-ordinate industrial action.

The strike misses the GCSE and A-level exam season.

In March, a national strike by the NUT forced the closure of 3,000 schools and pushed thousands more on to reduced timetables.

NUT general secretary, Christine Blower, last night accused the Government of failing to make progress in their dispute over teachers’ pay, pensions and workload.

She claimed Mr Gove’s education reforms are damaging the teacher profession and making it a ‘totally unattractive career choice’ which will ‘most certainly lead to teacher shortages’.

But in an angry exchange of words, the Department for Education insisted there was ‘no justification’ for further strikes as NUT talks with Ministers remain ongoing.

It also challenged her portrayal of teaching as being an unappealing profession.

A DfE spokesman said: ‘In fact, teaching has never been more attractive, more popular or more rewarding.

‘A record number of top graduates are now applying to become teachers and there have never been more teachers in England’s classrooms, with a rise of 9,000 in the last year.’

He added: ‘Further strike action will only disrupt parents’ lives, hold back children’s education and damage the reputation of the profession.’

The NUT’s campaign is aimed at challenging performance-related pay, changes to pension rules and tackling ‘excessive’ amounts of work.

The new system of performance-related pay has brought automatic pay rises to an end, with schools given the flexibility to offer higher salaries to the best teachers.

Head teachers can deny pay rises to staff who fail to improve exam results, demonstrate pupil progress, maintain discipline or opt out of extra-curricular activities.  

The NUT claims the new system is ‘unfair’ and will lead to pay cuts for many because of budget constraints. Changes to pensions would make them less generous and mean teachers retiring later.

Ms Blower said: ‘This (strike) action is the responsibility of a Government and Education Secretary who are refusing point blank to accept the damage their reforms are doing to the teaching profession.

‘Strike action is a last resort for teachers and we deeply regret the disruption it causes parents and pupils. This date has been chosen to cause minimum disruption to examinations.

‘Teaching is one of the best jobs in the world but is being made one of the worst under Michael Gove and the Coalition.’

The NASUWT joined the NUT in regional strike action across the country last year but did not take part in the March walkout due to Mr Gove agreeing to talks.  

Last year, Mr Gove told teachers they have never had it so good and accused union leaders of peddling the damaging falsehood that teaching is a ‘depressing and demotivating activity’.

Referring to the NUT and NASUWT, he said: ‘The picture these union leaders paint is of a profession which no one rational would want to join – a profession which is unattractive, unrewarding and unfulfilling.

‘The truth, however, is very different. Teaching, as a profession, has never been more attractive, more popular or more rewarding.’

In March, about one in eight schools in England were forced to close fully due the NUT walkout, according to Government estimates, but it is thought that many more were partially shut.

Norwich, Waveney in Suffolk, Great Yarmouth and Burnley were yesterday named and shamed by the Department for Education as being among the worst places in England for GCSE results.

Secondary schools in 17 areas fail to ensure the majority of their pupils get five A* to C grades including the core subjects of English and maths.

Department for Education statistics show that the worst area in England for GCSE results is Norwich, where only 45 per cent of pupils leave school with a set of decent qualifications.
