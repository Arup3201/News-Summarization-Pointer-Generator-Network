A Mexican national who fatally beat a former Baylor University history professor in 1997 was executed Wednesday night in Texas.

Ramiro Hernandez-Llanas, 44, was lethally injected in the state's death chamber in Huntsville.

In October 1997, while he was in the U.S. illegally, Hernandez-Llanas led 49-year-old Glen Lich from his house by telling him 
that there was a problem with a generator, then repeatedly clubbed him 
with a piece of steel rebar. Armed with a knife, he then attacked Lich's
 wife. She survived and testified against Hernandez-Llanas, who also had
 been linked to a rape and a stabbing.

Just 10 days before the murder, Lich had given Hernandez-Llanas a job helping with 
renovations at his ranch near Kerrville, about 65 miles northwest of San
 Antonio, in exchange for living quarters.

Strapped to a gurney inside the death chamber, Hernandez-Llanas asked for forgiveness.

'I'm happy... I am sorry for what I have done,' he said, speaking in Spanish during a nearly five-minute final statement. 'I'm looking at the angel of God.'

He blew kisses to family members and also thanked prison officers and the warden.

'I say this with a lot of love and happiness: I have no pain and no guilt. All I have is love,' he said.

As the lethal concoction took effect, he snored loudly twice, then appeared to go to sleep. He was pronounced dead 11 minutes later, at 6:28 p.m.

Hernandez-Llanas was the second Texas inmate to receive a lethal injection of a new supply of pentobarbital. Texas Department of Criminal Justice officials have refused to identify the source of the powerful sedative, contending secrecy is needed to protect the drug's provider from threats of violence from capital punishment opponents. 

Texas and other states that have the death penalty have been scrambling for substitute drugs or new sources for drugs for lethal injections after major drugmakers — many based in Europe with longtime opposition to the death penalty — stopped selling to prisons and corrections departments.Hernandez-Llanas' appeals were exhausted, and the Texas parole board on Tuesday refused to delay his death sentence or commute it to life in prison.

On Wednesday, the Mexican government's Ministry of Foreign Affairs released a statement condemning the execution.

'This is the fourth case of a Mexican being executed in clear violation of the judgment of the International Court of Justice,' the ministry said. 'The Government of Mexico expresses its most vigorous protest at the failure to comply.'

Hernandez-Llanas was in Texas after escaping from a Mexican prison, where he was serving a 25-year sentence for a 1989 bludgeoning murder in Nuevo Laredo. He was linked to the rape of a 15-year-old girl and a stabbing in Kerrville. While awaiting trial, evidence showed he slashed another inmate's face with a razor blade. In prison, he was found with homemade weapons.

'This is exactly why we have the death penalty,' Lucy Wilke, an assistant Kerr County district attorney who helped prosecute Hernandez-Llanas, said ahead of the execution. 'Nobody, even prison guards, is safe from him.'

Hernandez-Llanas was the sixth prisoner executed this year in Texas, the nation's busiest death penalty state.
