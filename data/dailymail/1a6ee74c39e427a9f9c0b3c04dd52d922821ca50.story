Louis van Gaal may not want to rake over his difficult relationship with Ronald Koeman ahead of Manchester United’s game at Southampton on Monday night, but he’s only too happy to lavish praise on his former player Graziano Pelle and compare him to Robin van Persie.

Van Gaal signed Pelle – who has taken the Premier League by storm with 10 goals already this season - as a raw 21-year-old for AZ Alkmaar in 2007.

Two years later, the 6ft4ins Italian striker was part of the LVG’s team that shocked traditional superpowers Ajax, Feyenoord and PSV to win the Dutch title.

Pelle joined Southampton for £9million in the summer and that already looks like a major bargain. Van Gaal knows if in-form United are to win their fifth game in a row, they’ll need to stop him.

‘I am not surprised by Pelle because I knew when I bought him at AZ, he was an attacking (focal) point for the team,’ said van Gaal.

‘I’ve said about Robin van Persie that I like strikers who are an attacking point, not only a striker who scores goals. Pelle also scores goals but Van Persie also scores goals. Attacking point is very important.

‘He is also very creative. He is always seeing the third man. Van Persie is also always seeing the third man. Those kind of strikers are the ones I like. It may be a surprise that he scored 10 goals – that is a lot – but he can do it. I knew that.

‘I bought him after he played for the (Italy) under-21s in the European Championships that were in the Netherlands. I visited the matches and saw him, and he came to AZ.

‘We had Shota Arveladze, one of the best strikers I have trained in my career, and he had to compete with him. I have trained a lot of strikers but he was one of the best and he had to compete with him which was not easy. But later on he came in the squad and showed his capacity.

‘Then Koeman bought him – because he was also manager of AZ – he took him with him to Feyenoord and he explodes. It is fantastic for him.’

Van Gaal will face off against Southampton boss Ronald Koeman on Monday night at St Mary's

Koeman was assistant coach to Van Gaal during his time as coach of Barcelona 

It is the only time van Gaal voluntarily mentions Koeman. The pair have a notoriously frosty relationship dating back to their time at Ajax a decade ago when Koeman was manager and van Gaal technical director.

Van Gaal insists he will shake Koeman’s hand before and after the game without any problem, but won’t have time to engage in social niceties after the match as he will be too busy, pointing out he didn’t have a chance to chat with Mark Hughes after Tuesday night’s win against Stoke City.

Apart from that, any attempt to elicit words about his relationship with Koeman failed. ‘You don’t listen, it is private,’ glared the United boss.

Van Gaal will be keen to keep United’s recent momentum going. Wayne Rooney will be back after a minor knee injury to skipper the side and van Persie is likely to be his partner with James Wilson and Falcao on the bench.

The Colombian, whose loan period at Old Trafford has been dogged by injuries, can expect to be asked by van Gaal to play with the under-21 side at some stage to build his match sharpness.

A top-four place remains United’s over-riding ambition this season. ‘We are going the right way,’ said van Gaal, who stopped short of guaranteeing fans Champions League football next season.
