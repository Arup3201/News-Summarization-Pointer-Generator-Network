One of Mexico's most notorious drug lords is in custody after he apparently inundated Twitter and Instagram with photos showing his penchant for ill-gotten sports cars, yachts and guns.

Jose Rodrigo Arechiga Gamboa, otherwise known as 'El Chino Antrax,' was arrested at Amsterdam's Airport Schiphol after he arrived on a flight from South America under a false name last Tuesday.

He is a suspected top enforcer for the powerful Sinaloa Cartel and is wanted on drug charges in Southern California, a U.S. federal law enforcement official revealed.

According to local media, Arechiga is one of the two leaders of a group of hit men who call themselves the 'Anthrax,' like the deadly disease.

According to local media, Arechiga is one of the two leaders of a group of hit men who call themselves the 'Anthrax,' like the deadly disease

The group is blamed for a series of murders, including the killings of three men who were hung off a bridge in 2011, that were seen as revenge after one of their leaders was murdered. The Anthrax also helped the Sinaloa organization as it engaged in a bloody war with the Beltran Leyva cartel, when the latter decided to splinter in 2008.

Several folk songs, known as narcocorridos, mention 'El Chino Antrax' as an elegant and fit man with a taste for sports cars, yachts and Champagne.

And it appears he couldn't help but boast about his extravagant lifestyle on social media, something which may have helped U.S. investigators build their case against him.

Less-than-discreet Twitter and Instagram accounts reportedly belonging to Arechiga show a man with his face blurred out in luxury cars, wielding automatic weapons and posing with scantily clad women. Other flashy shots show boats, helicopters and expensive jewelry and one picture even shows the man with Paris Hilton. According to a report, he photobombed the socialite while she was giving an interview to an Asian TV network.

However, one image, posted Tuesday morning cast doubt on whether the feed in fact belonged to the alleged drug boss.

In almost every other picture he is seen with a prominant ring, and in the most recent photo, posted when Arechiga is in custody, shows a hand wearing the ring perusing newspaper articles of his arrest.

It's not clear the exact role social media played in Arechiga's arrest but the International Business Times reported the information garnered provided important clues about his movements and contacts.

Arechiga is a right-hand man of Sinaloa bosses Ismael Zambada and Joaquin 'El Chapo' Guzman. His identity was initially kept secret by Dutch police, who simply said they'd arrested a 33-year-old Mexican man on behalf of U.S. authorities.

His name was later leaked to the Associated Press by the law enforcement official, who spoke on condition of anonymity because the person wasn't authorized to discuss the case.

He is being held in a Dutch jail, pending his extradition to the U.S.

The Mexican Embassy in The Netherlands said it was aware of the detention of a Mexican citizen and that it was willing to offer consular assistance if he requested help.

The U.S. attorney's office in San Diego didn't immediately respond to messages seeking comment on his arrest and possible prosecution. But the federal official said the charges stem from a federal court in San Diego.
