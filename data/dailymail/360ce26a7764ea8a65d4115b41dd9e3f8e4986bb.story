A former mayor and her grown-up daughter kept dozens of animals in squalid conditions at their home which 'stank of urine and faeces', a court has heard.

Pamela Ann Crisp-Beard, 63, and her daughter Maria, 24, kept a menagerie at their cramped terraced home in Horncastle, Lincolnshire.

The pets included 15 rabbits, a golden pheasant, two guinea pigs, five mice, two rats, a cat, two dogs, four domestic ducks, a goose and 22 chickens, a parrot and two ferrets.

Neighbours contacted the RSCPA over concerns about the animals and officers discovered they were living in filthy conditions and the pair were arrested.

The mother and daughter denied six animal welfare charges and are on trial at Skegness Magistrates Court.

Pamela Ann Crisp-Beard was Mayor of Horncastle between May 1997 and May 1998, and a Horncastle town councillor between 2003 and 2011, the court heard.

She and her daughter kept some of the animals indoors, including in a bedroom, at their home, while others were left in the back garden.

RSPCA inspector Deborah Scotcher told the court that when she visited the house on January 13 this year her feet squelched on the hall carpets because they were sodden with urine.

The court heard that some of the cages were stacked floor to ceiling at the pairs terraced home

RSPCA inspector Deborah Scotcher alleged that the majority of the animals did not have food or clean drinking water

She gave the pair three days to improve the situation but when she returned there was no improvement.

Ms Scotcher came back a third time with two police officers and a vet on January 29, and took the animals away.

She told the court: 'The entire place stank of urine and faeces and several rooms, including the kitchen, were cold, dank and dark, and full of rubbish and other debris.

'Some of the animals were kept in cages stacked from floor to ceiling in the front room and there was a gaping hole in the ceiling.

'Some of the dirty straw inside the cages was inches thick with excrement.

'I struggled to identify the golden pheasant, kept in the back garden of the property, because it was so badly caked in mud and faeces.

'On my first visit I found some of the animals were kept in cages with filthy, sodden straw.

'The cages were not suitable for the animals housed in them and some food bowls were empty, while others contained stagnant dirty water.

'Conditions outside were squalid, the garden was full of mud, faeces and urine, and my feet squelched in the mud and faeces.'

Ms Scotcher claimed the majority of the animals did not have food or clean drinking water.

The house was first visited on January 13 after an anonymous call to the RSPCA's national hotline.

During the first RSPCA visit both Pamela and Maria Crisp-Beard were present but while Ms Scotcher had grave concerns, she decided not to take any official action.

She told the pair that she would return and expected to see a significant improvement in conditions, claiming she wanted to give them a 'second chance'.

But upon returning three days later, the conditions had not improved and the house still smelled horrible.

Among the problems was the fact that the rabbits, housed in two shed-like buildings, lacked suitable light and ventilation, and some animals outside had no proper shelter at all.

Ms Scotcher then returned to the house a third time, now with two police officers and a vet, 16 days after her first visit.

The vet inspected the animals and decided that the best course of action was to remove them from the property.

Upon examination, one of the dogs appeared to be underweight and the rabbits had excrement matted in their fur.

The court heard that while Pamela Crisp-Beard admitted to owning the animals, her daughter Maria also 'had a duty of care' because she often looked after them too.

The Crisp-Beards are appealing the decision to seize the animals which have been kept in a private boarding sanctuary since January.

The trial was adjourned until December 12.
