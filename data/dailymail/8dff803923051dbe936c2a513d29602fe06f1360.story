Two former Chris Christie appointees have met with federal prosecutors about the 'Bridgegate' fiasco, adding new fuel to the fire just weeks after a report commissioned by the New Jersey governor appeared to clear his name.

Former Port Authority official David Wildstein and former Christie chief counsel Charlie McKenna have both begun the process of disentangling themselves from scandal swirling around the Republican governor, according to liberal bloggers at Esquire magazine and the online legal publication Main Justice.

U.S. Attorney Paul Fishman, the New Jersey prosecutor who succeeded Christie in that office, has begun presenting evidence to a grand jury. Longtime Christie press secretary Michael Drewniak has been in and out of those proceedings.

Wildstein put himself at the center of a plot to snarl traffic in a New Jersey town last September by giving the order to choke off traffic lanes leading to the George Washington Bridge – in apparent retaliation for a Democratic mayor's failure to endorse Christie's re-election bid.

David Wildstein (C), former Port Authority of New York and New Jersey Director of Interstate Capital Projects and an ally of New Jersey Governor Chris Christie, is apparently baring his 'Bridgegate' soul to a federal prosecutor

Chris Christie, already parlaying his NJ governorship into a presidential trial balloon, is betting that a recent report clearing his name will withstand the scrutiny of Paul Fishman -- a tough US Attorney who got his old job when he moved to the state capitol

Michael Drewniak (C), the Christie press secretary who has worked with him since his days as a prosecutor, has reportedly talked to a federal grand jury about the Bridgegate scandal

He would later claim the closure of several bridge on-ramp lanes during back-to-school week was part of a traffic study, intended  to determine if the rest of the bridge would move faster once lanes dedicated to the town of Fort Lee were repurposed,

Wildstein has claimed he told Christie about the lane closures – while they were in place – when the two spoke at a 9/11 memorial service in Manhattan. Christie has insisted he knew nothing until later when media outlets began asking questions.

But the Port Authority bigwig – a former Christie schoolmate assigned to a position created just for him – met last week with prosecutors to tell his side of the story.

McKenna was the governor's chief legal adviser while the plot was taking shape, and likely has inside information about any role of the governor's office had in coordinating the stories of officials connected to the scandal.

Wildstein and fired Christie deputy chief of staff Bridget Kelly, for instance, participated in the infamous email exchange that launched the investigation.

'Time for some traffic problems in Fort Lee,' Kelly wrote him.

'Got it,' he replied.

Wildstein refused to testify before an investigative committee controlled by Democrats in the New Jersey legislature.

So has Kelly. Christie fired her publicly in January.

But Bill Baroni, another Port Authority higher-up, did testify in the fall, weeks before surrendering his job.

Baroni stuck to he 'traffic study' story in a performance that Wildstein later said McKenna praised.

Scene of the crime? The rightmost lanes into this George Washington Bridge entry plaza, normally reserved for traffic entering from the town of Fort Lee, N.J., were repurposed for general traffic during a week in September, bringing traffic in that town to a screeching halt

Alleged ringleader: Former Christie deputy chief of staff Bridget Kelly has refused to testify without a grant of immunity

As Christie prepares for what observers expect to be a tumultuous presidential run in 2016, his former underlings may be positioning themselves to cut deals with the government.

Kelly and Wildstein have both said through their attorneys that they would share what they know if they were promised immunity from prosecution. There has been no sign that their wishes have been granted, but Wildstein's cooperation may point in that direction.

His attorney Alan Zegas did not respond to a phone message seeking comment.

Fishman, by all accounts a methodical and skilled federal prosecutor, reportedly holds no special place in his heart for the New Jersey governor who had the job before him.

According to multiple witnesses at Christie's going-away party in the U.S. Attorney's office, Fishman – angry at Christie for taking so many skilled lawyers with him to the governor's office – threw a copy of a New Jersey directory of lawyers at his feet, saying he should consult it before embarking on his next recruiting binge.

The Esquire writer whose scoop re-energized the Bridgegate story late on Monday is another anti-Christie partisan.

Scott Raab wrote on Esquire.com that the March report clearing Christie 'is a steaming pile of crap, a classic Christie smear job, designed to reach the only result that might spare his political life.'

'Now that David Wildstein’s talking, his days as governor are numbered -- in weeks and months, not years,' a gleeful Raab predicted.
