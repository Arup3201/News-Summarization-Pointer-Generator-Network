The teenager accused of sexually assaulting and killing a six-year-old girl who was his next door neighbor in Washington state, was charged as an adult Friday with aggravated murder and aggravated rape.

Gabriel Gaeta, 17, would face life in prison without the possibility of parole if convicted of the murder charge in Kitsap County Superior Court.

He will not face the death penalty — the maximum penalty for aggravated murder in Washington state — because he is under 18.

Prosecutor Russ Hauge said he's still waiting for the results of an evaluation of Gaeta's competency to stand trial.

Violent streak: Gabriel Gaeta reportedly wrote online about killing people and enjoying seeing chilldren cry

Loss: Jenise was last seen on August 2 and her body was found in a muddy boy by the FBI on August 7

Ominous: Gaeta wrote this post on Ask.fm a year before Jenise's killing

Ruthless: This reply stood out among Gaeta's other posts about school and his obsession with wrestling

Gaeta has been held in the Kitsap County Juvenile Detention Center on $1 million bail since his arrest August 9th.

Two
 days earlier, Jenise Wright's body was found after an intensive search 
involving hundreds of law enforcement officers and others.

An
 FBI team with search dogs discovered the girl's body covered by a wood 
pallet and submerged in a muddy bog in woods near her Bremerton home.

Authorities
 say they linked evidence found near the girl's body to the DNA of 
Gaeta, a high school student with no criminal history.

Clues: Police found evidence near Jenise's body that linked her to the DNA of Gaeta, her neighbor 

Authorities
 said they linked evidence found near the girl's body to the DNA of 
Gaeta, a wrestling champion with no criminal history.

A search of his 
bedroom turned up a blood- and mud-covered shirt and a bloody towel.

Court records showed Jenise Wright suffered brunt-force trauma to the head and was strangled and sexually assaulted.

She suffered blunt-force 
trauma to the head and was strangled and sexually assaulted, and that 
her body appeared to have been moved between a half-hour and three hours
 after she died.

Her underwear and shorts were found 15-20 feet away 
from her remains

She was last seen by her parents when she went to bed August 2 at her family's home in a mobile-home park.

Officials have said there were no signs of forced entry at the residence and no indication Jenise taken from her home.

Staying strong: James Wright, pictured with his wife Denise, said he has forgiven the 17-year-old neighbor accused of sexually assaulting and killing their six-year-old daughter Jenise last month

In court: Gaeta seen being led into Kitsap County Superior Court for a hearing last month with a jacket concealing his face from news cameras

Gaeta
 has been described by James Wright, Jenise's father, as a close friend 
of the family.

His residence was two homes away from the access point to
 a wooded trail that led to where the body was found, according to court
 documents.

Gaeta was a star member of Olympic High School's wrestling team.

But
 the strapping teen depicted smiling in Facebook photographs reportedly 
had a violent streak that manifested itself off the wrestling mat.

In
 response to the question 'Wanna fight?' posted on the site Ask.fm, 
Gaeta wrote: 'No. I don't fight. I just kill people until the point 
where they're dead.'

Replying
 to another question, 'What's the latest thing that made you smile?' the
 high school student portentously wrote: 'A child crying.'

James and Denise Wright reported 
Jenise missing on August 3. As authorities began investigating her 
disappearance, three children - aged eight, 12 and 16 - were removed 
from their care.

After she 
went missing, it emerged that James wright was arrested in 2000 on 
felony charges of child molestation in the first degree after an 
8-year-old girl said he inappropriately touched them after a night of 
drinking.

More than a 
year later, in June 2001, the charges were amended to include 
third-degree child molestation after a 15-year-old girl who was 
babysitting the girl during New Year's Eve 2000 said that Wright touched
 her breasts and put his hands down her pants.

Jenise's body was found on August 7 after an intensive search involving hundreds of law enforcement officers and others.

An
 FBI team with search dogs discovered the girl's body covered by a small wood 
pallet and submerged in a muddy bog in woods near her Bremerton home.
