Fast-food giant McDonald's has taken ownership of France's signature bread and decided to start dishing up burgers in baguettes.

McDo, as the French call it, is trying to appeal to more upscale diners by mixing their famous beef burgers with French-made Emmental cheese and mustard.

Starting in April, the 1,228 McDonald's restaurants across
 France will feature the limited edition McBaguette.

McDonald's is trying to appeal to national culinary tastes and have come up with around 20 locally tailored menu items in 14 European countries including:

Finland: offers the Rye McFeast, a burger served on a rye bun

Spain: sells the tomato-based soup Gazpacho

Italy: McDonald's worked with Gualtiero Marchesi, the country's only three-star chef, to create three new recipes: two sandwiches called Adagio and Vivace.

The fast-food chain said it has similar plans to work in partnership in Germany and Austria.

In France, McCafés already are serving slices of baguette for breakfast, as well as macarons, sweet meringue-based confections that are riding a popularity wave of their own during the day.

It will replace the fast-food chain's 
current special menu in the country, which is three limited-edition burgers featuring 
locally produced cheeses, reports the Wall Street Journal.

The introduction of the McBaguette, is in line with the US company's plan to ensure its restaurants appeal to a broader customer base.

In
 France, bread is served with many meals and a recent study showed that 
65 per cent of the two billion sandwiches sold each year in France are 
baguette-based.

Yves 
Marin, a senior manager at consulting firm Kurt Salmon, said to the Wall
 Street Journal 'McDonald's is trying to diversify and is aiming at more
 traditional or older customers.

'The company is willing to attract those who won't eat the Big Mac.'

The McBaguette debut, could also give the company more pricing power.

It
 will be sold for 4.50 euros ($6, £3.80) - more than a euro above the 
average price of a sandwich in France, reports the Wall Street Journal.

The company has come up with around 20 menu items which could appeal locally in 14 European countries.

In Finland, the fast-food chain offers the 
Rye McFeast, a burger served on a rye bun, and in Spain, it offers the 
tomato-based soup Gazpacho.

In France, McCafés, which have been well received, already serve 
slices of baguette for breakfast.

The reaction from France remains to be seen, but one Parisian who was shown a picture of the
 sandwich as she left a bakery, told the Wall Street Journal:

'It doesn't quite look like a baguette; a baguette isn't square. But I
 would give it a try,'

'It looks good, and much healthier than 
McDo's regular burger,' another added.

McDonald's said it could introduce the baguette burger again if the initial six-week run is a success.
