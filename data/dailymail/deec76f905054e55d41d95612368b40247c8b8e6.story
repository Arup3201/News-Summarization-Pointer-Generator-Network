Manchester City's senior stars have defiantly claimed the Premier League title race isn't over despite Chelsea's last-minute winner against Everton on Wednesday night keeping Jose Mourinho's men seven points clear at the top.

Captain Vincent Kompany and experienced defender Pablo Zabaleta both pointed to City's previous Premier League triumphs to show why Manuel Pellegrini's men still believe they can claw back the deficit.

City won the title in 2012 despite trailing Manchester United by eight points with six games to go and last season Liverpool held the title destiny in their hands until the end of April.

With City winning their first league game since New Year's Day by a convincing 4-1 margin at Stoke City this week, Zabaleta said: 'We are Manchester City and we never give up, simple as that.

'We have had that situation before, when we won the league in 2012. We were eight points beind United.

'Mourinho said the other day that seven points is different in this league because every game is like a final. We have 13 games to go to the end. We have belief in the team and if we play like we did at Stoke, we will have a great chance to catch them. We cannot afford to drop points though.'

Kompany hailed the result at the Britannia Stadium – in which Sergio Aguero scored twice and gave his best performance since returning from a knee injury – as a potential turning point.

He said: 'I guess we had to find our form and all of a sudden something has freed up. We started looking more like the team we are.

'It is a good feeling. It is a massive win, a good result and it gives us a lot of confidence now with 10 days break.'

City are already eliminated from the FA Cup so don't play again until they face Newcastle United at The Etihad the following weekend.

Pellegrini will also have £28million January signing Wilfried Bony and Yaya Toure available as they return after helping Ivory Coast win the African Cup of Nations.

City seemed set to cut the gap at the top of the table to five points but Willian scored a late winner to help Chelsea beat Everton 1-0 at Stamford Bridge.
