American workers are less scared of being fired and are growing more confident in their level of job security according to an influential poll.

The findings by Gallup suggest that job security among workers in the Unites States is at a record high and people are generally happier with their wages, jobs and benefits.

According to the survey, 58 per cent of full-or part-time workers are confident completely satisfied with their job security.

Satisfaction: Gallup's results show a marked increase in the number of American workers who are satisfied with their job security

This represents an increase from the levels recorded during the aftermath of the recession -- from 2009 to 2013 -- when roughly 50 per cent of Americans said they were completely satisfied.

Over the past five years, workers’ key concerns were the weak economy and soft job market, despite the unemployment rate falling in 2010.

Meanwhile, worker satisfaction with different aspects of their jobs vary widely.

One
 in four workers, or 27 per cent, are completely satisfied with their 
amount of on-the-job stress, while three in four (74 per cent) are 
satisfied with physical safety conditions in the workplace.

However, the unemployment rate is currently down to nearly 6 per cent which appears to have given the American workforce a well-needed boost.

This is helping many workers feel less fearful of getting the dreaded pink slip.

Worry: These findings show that worries over wages, hours and layoffs vary widely

Gallup: The poll examined everything from safety in the workplace to chances of promotion among workers

However, according to Forbes, the ‘real' unemployment rate is around 12.6 per cent.

This number reflects the government’s ‘U-6’ report, which accounts for the full unemployment picture including those ‘marginally attached to the labor force.’

It also includes those ‘employed part time for economic reasons.’

It paints a picture of people doing jobs that they are overqualified for until they find something suitable in their field.

Yet while many are having to adjust their work habits, Gallup suggests that among those with a job, overall job satisfaction has increased over the past year.

Last year, 54 per cent of workers were completely satisfied with the amount of vacation time they receive. This increased by five percentage points to 59 per cent in 2014.

Recovery: President Barack Obama claimed during a Democratic Party fundraising dinner that the United States is 'stronger' since he took office in 2009

In 2013, 56 per cent were satisfied with their boss or immediate supervisor. In 2014, 60 per cent are satisfied -- a four-point increase.

The findings match those released by the US Commerce Department.

It releases data each month on the number of layoffs as a percentage of total employment of the layoff rate.

It was at a record high during the recession, but has fallen consistently since and is now back to pre-recession levels.

But while the findings are welcome news it does not point to a full recovery.

A recent Gallup poll found that only 31 percent of workers were satisfied with their earnings, a two point improvement over 2013, but low nonetheless.

Earlier this month, President Barack Obama claimed during a Democratic Party fundraising dinner that the United States is 'stronger' since he took office.

Yet, the federal government's debts have ballooned by $7 trillion since he became Commander-in Chief.

The U.S. economy has been under immense strain over the past five years.

And the percentage of working-age Americans who are part of the U.S. workforce has reached the lowest level since 1978.

Millions more remain unemployed.
