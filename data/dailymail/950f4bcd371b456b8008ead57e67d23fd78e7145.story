A married TV weatherman has been fired after an inappropriate conversation he had on Facebook with another woman was published on the internet.

Geoff Fox was told to leave Fox Connecticut when his bosses became aware of the dialogue, which was of an explicit and sexual nature.

The transcripts of his chat with a photographer named Zoel Kennedy were published on a blog and went viral before somebody at the TV studio noticed.

Shamed meteorologist Geoff Fox has lost his job after bosses found out about sexually explicit webchats he had been having

Fox had engaged in explicit Facebook exchanges with photographer Zoel Kennedy, right

The conversation appeared under the headline: ‘Married Fox News Weatherman Caught Sexting With a Photographer.’

Fox Connecticut, which has the motto: ‘Trusted, experienced, accurate’ said that Fox’s conduct was ‘inappropriate’ and that he had been asked to leave 18 months into the job.

But in a post on his blog ‘My Permanent Record’, Fox wrote to his former bosses imploring them to take him back.

He wrote that he was ‘on my knees begging you to reconsider your decision’ and that he would make up for it.

He wrote: ‘I had no idea this private conversation would be made public, but what I did was still wrong even if it had remained private.

‘This is a very difficult time for my family. I betrayed a trust with my wife and daughter which won’t be mended quickly. I have made promises to them I intend to keep.

‘Losing my job is also very difficult.

‘You probably noticed I wrote about my work there with a smile on my face. I was proud to work there and proud of what we offered the public.

‘It was the best job I ever held.’

The post before on the blog was about a visit Fox made to his neurosurgeon in which he talks about a successful operation.

The doctor’s advice to him from now on was to take it easy and ‘don’t be an idiot’.

The firing was the second time in 18 months Fox had been given his marching orders.

Weatherman Geoff Fox has been working for Fox Connecticut for 18 months before he was fired

He had previously worked at Connecticut TV channel WTNH for 26 years but in January last year, despite being a hit with viewers, he was summarily dismissed upon his return from holiday.

At the time Fox wrote on his blog: ‘A few weeks ago when I learned there would be no new contract for me I was told I’d return on-air at WTNH following my vacation.

‘That will not happen’.

Viewers responded by calling Fox an ‘icon’ and calling for a boycott of WTNH in support of him whilst a Facebook page in support got 9,273 likes.

A spokesman for Fox Connecticut said: ‘As this is a personnel matter, FOX CT will offer no further comment or details surrounding Mr Fox’s dismissal’.
