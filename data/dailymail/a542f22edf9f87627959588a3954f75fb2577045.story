Rangers caretaker manager Kenny McDowall has told David Templeton he should not be scared of giving the ball away.

The former Hearts winger was back in the Ibrox side's line up on Saturday for the first time since the middle of November.

The 3-1 win over Dumbarton was just his seventh start of the campaign - a poor return for a player who cost the Glasgow giants £700,000 when he moved from Tynecastle in 2012.

David Templeton made his first start for Rangers in almost two months against Dumbarton on Saturday

McDowall - who picked up his first win as Gers boss since replacing Ally McCoist - admits the 25-year-old has suffered a crisis of confidence after being reduced to the role of an impact sub for most of the season.

But after seeing him impress against the Sons, McDowall says Templeton must be given the licence to take on defender - and reassured him he will not be criticised if he gives away possession.

He said: 'David did well on Saturday. He's short on a bit of confidence but I told him to just go and express himself.

'He's a flair player. He can't be afraid to go and lose possession. He's the type of boy who has to be allowed to do that.

'As much as you would like him to keep it, that's what they do - they entertain and try to take people on. He gets a wee bit more scope to do that than other people.'

Meanwhile, Jon Daly hopes his Ibrox equaliser will be enough for him to keep hold of his own starting slot.

McDowall made three changes to the team humiliated by last week's 4-0 thrashing from Hibernian.

Ian Black - who had to be replaced after just half an hour in the capital as he flirted with a red card - was dropped to the bench along side Fraser Aird and Nicky Clark.

Kyle Hutton, Templeton and Daly were the men brought in to spice up Rangers faltering season and the Irish frontman made the most of his chance after two games on the bench as he cancelled out Andy Graham's shock opener for Dumbarton.

Lee Wallace and Dean Shiels ensured Rangers got the win which trims Hearts' Scottish Championship lead back to 13 points and now Daly hopes his part in a winning display will have been picked up by the interim manager.

He said: 'You need games as a striker. I'm sure the other front lads at the club will tell you they need a run of games just to find your match sharpness firstly, then to try and get your eye in with the goals.

'It's been frustrating for me personally. It wasn't ideal starting the season with an operation.

Striker Jon Daly, who scored in the win over Dumbarton, hopes his goal will lead to more time on the pitch

'There are a lot of quality strikers at the club and I knew I had to be patient. But hopefully I did enough on Saturday to give myself the opportunity to play the next game.

'I'm sure the manager will go with the team that he thinks has the best chance of beating Alloa next week, so that is why it's important at a club like Rangers to take your chances when they come along.'
