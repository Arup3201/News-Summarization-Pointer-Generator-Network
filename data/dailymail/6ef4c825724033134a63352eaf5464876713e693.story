Manny Pacquiao has been training hard recently, so it’s hardly surprising he replaces the many thousands of calories he burns with a big feast.

The Filipino star looked relaxed as he took his mind off his upcoming $300million (£200m) mega-fight against Floyd Mayweather Jnr with a family meal.

It’s a little over six weeks before the duo go head-to-head in Las Vegas and the 36-year-old has again stepped up his training in recent days, this time sparring for the first time with partners Edis Tatli and Kenneth Sims Jnr.

Tatil, a Finnish lightweight, has lost just once in 25 fights while Sims has fought just five times but his style has been likened to Mayweather's.

'After 13 days of strength and conditioning and boxing drills at Wild Card plus weeks more of working out in the Philippines in February, it was great to finally put on the headgear and spar,' Pacquiao said.

Outside of the ring, Sky Sports are expected to be declared the winners of the bidding war for the television rights to the mega-fight.

Sky has been in fierce competition from Frank Warren’s BoxNation channel, but are believed to be on the brink of securing the richest fight in ring history.
