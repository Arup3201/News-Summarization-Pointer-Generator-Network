It looks like something out of the X-Men, but the ground-breaking technology behind Eye Play the Piano has allowed this physically disabled schoolboy to make music - simply by moving his eyes.

The crowd-funded project has been developed in conjunction with the University of Tsukuba’s Special Needs Education School for the Physically Challenged and headset manufacture FOVE in Japan, and uses virtual technology to track the eye movements of the wearer.

In this video,  high school student Kota Numajiri can be seen 'virtually' playing the piano to accompany his classmates during a Christmas carol concert at the school.

The specially-designed headset uses virtual technology to track the eye movements of the wearer which is then relayed to a connected piano, which in turn plays the music

Mesmerised family and friends in the audience look on in astonishment as Kota blinks his way through the music using specially-designed panels, which is then conveyed to the connected piano triggering the sound.

By tilting his head down, Kota mimics the piano pedal which in turn lengthens the selected note.

'The idea of expression coming only from the actions of the human eyes does not only apply to playing the piano but we also believe that this technology can open up many new possibilities to all humans,' said Fove chief executive Yuka Kojima on the JustGiving page. 

Fove is now trying to raise ¥1.5m (just over £8,450) to distribute the hardware to 135 schools for physically disabled children around Japan.
