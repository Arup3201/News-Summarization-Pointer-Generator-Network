A slender mother-of-four devoured a 72oz steak in 2 minutes 44 seconds, earning her a place in the world record books - and a spot of indigestion, no doubt.

Molly Schuyler, 34, of Nebraska, uploaded a video to YouTube showing her tackling the hefty lump of beef at Sayler's Old Country Kitchen in Portland on January 3.

Instead of using a knife and fork she is seen eating with her hands.

When she is a third of the way through the meat feast, a spectator exclaims: 'This is where most men stop . . . after an hour', but Ms Schuyler perseveres.

Large appetite: Molly Schuyler wolfed down a 72oz steak in 2 minutes 44 seconds, earning her a place in the world record books - and a spot of indigestion, no doubt

She manages to obliterate the previous 72oz steak-eating world record - which stood at 6 minutes and 48 seconds and was held by a 'body building huge man' - by cleaning her plate in less than half the time.

Despite the colossal size of her dish, Mrs Schuyler's appetite continues to roll, and she is seen reaching for handfuls of fries after taking a gulp of water.

Challenge in Portland.

She completed the incredible feat in 54 minutes and was the only woman to finish.

A $650 cash prize was awarded to her for finishing the food.

When asked what the toughest part was Mrs Schuyler, who works as a restaurant server, said the meat because she doesn't like salami or pepperoni.

Talking about her speed-eating abilities, she added: ‘It's an unexplained phenomenon.

‘I was just born that way. I started doing this about a year ago, and I guess it's like a stupid human trick.'

Her husband, Sean, also says she is 'amazing when it comes to eating.'

In 2013 Mrs Schuyler competed in more than 20 different food eating contests across the country.

New-found skill: Mrs Schuyler, a full-time server, only started eating competitively last August

Victories included eating 9lbs of fried mushrooms in 8 minutes and eight beef patties in 1 minute and 46 seconds.

She also beat ‘Man vs Food’s Adam Richman at Jethro's BBQ Diner challenge in Iowa by polishing off a 5lb meat sandwich made of pork, chicken, bacon, brisket and deep fried cheese in less than eight minutes.

All Pro Eating, the world's only independent competitive eating organization, lists her as the world's number one female.
