Flights were temporarily halted at London Stansted Airport after a suspicious person under the flight path sparked a firearm scare.

Essex Police officers raced to Molehill Green, just east of the airport, after a passer-by reported a man holding what appeared to be a firearm on Sunday afternoon.

The man was standing under the flight path and police eventually located him and determined that he did not pose a threat to aircraft or nearby residents.

It turns out the man was not armed with a gun – he was a plane spotter who was carrying a camera and photography equipment.

In a statement, a spokesperson for Essex Police said: 'Police were called to Molehill Green, near Stansted Airport, shortly before 2pm on Sunday, November 30 following reports of a man standing under the flight path and holding what appeared to be a firearm.

‘A search was carried out and the man was found at about 2.40pm.

'He was carrying photographic equipment.’

Stansted Airport flights were suspended for about 30 minutes, causing 'minimal delays'

A spokesman for the airport said flights in and out of Stansted were suspended for about 30 minutes while police investigated.

Operations returned to normal once police located the man and were satisfied no one was in any danger.

The spokesman told MailOnline Travel: 'This suspension caused minimal delays to flights.'
