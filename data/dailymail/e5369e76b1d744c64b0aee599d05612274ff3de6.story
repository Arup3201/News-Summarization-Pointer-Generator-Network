A defiant Nick Clegg this morning rejected a shock poll suggesting he is on course to lose his seat in Parliament.

The Deputy Prime Minister said the survey, which has him trailing Labour by 10 points, was 'utter bilge'.

According to the Survation poll more than half of Mr Clegg's 2010 supporters are planning to desert him in May - with just 23 per cent of Sheffield Hallam voters now set to back him.

Labour has surged to 33 per cent in Sheffield Hallam – up 17 per cent on 2010, according to the survey of 1,011 residents in Mr Clegg's Sheffield Hallam constituency

Labour meanwhile has surged to 33 per cent  – up 17 points on 2010, according to the survey of 1,011 residents in Mr Clegg's South Yorkshire constituency.

The Tories are just one point behind Mr Clegg on 22 per cent, with the Greens and Ukip both enjoying a surge in support.

The shock poll comes just 24 hours after leaked surveys of crucial seats in Scotland suggested Treasury Secretary Danny Alexander was also on course to lose his seat.

But the Deputy Prime Minister shrugged off the polling this morning. Mr Clegg told LBC radio: 'This poll is such utter, utter bilge.' 

Overall, the SNP are on course to sweep across Scotland, wiping out both the Lib Dems and Labour.

Mr Alexander and Labour's election chief Douglas Alexander among those who face losing their seats to the Scottish nationalists, according to the polling by Tory peer Lord Ashcroft.

Lord Ashcroft's poll of 16 key seats found Nicola Sturgeon's nationalist party ahead in 15 of the 16 seats, putting the SNP on course to hold the balance of power after May's election.

Labour has been rocked by the extraordinary surge in support for the SNP in the wake of the independence referendum in September, despite voters rejecting their plan for separation.

According to the Survation poll Mr Clegg is on course to lose more than half his vote in May, dropping 30 points to just 23 per cent

First Minister Alex Salmond quit as SNP leader to be replaced by Miss Sturgeon, but now plans to stand for election to Westminster.

Polls have repeatedly suggested the SNP will make huge gains, with Labour facing heavy losses and the Lib Dems and Tories wiped out altogether.

Former Prime Minister Gordon Brown has been called back to the frontline to support new Scottish Labour leader Jim Murphy in an attempt to stem the losses.

Lord Ashcroft's research focused mainly on Labour seats in areas which had voted in favour of independence, or only narrowly voted against.

Of the 16 seats, it found only Glasgow North East is likely to back Ed Miliband's party.

The swing from Labour to the SNP varies from 21 to 27 per cent. If a swing of 21 per cent was repeated across Scotland, Labour would lose 35 of its 41 seats in Scotland.

Mr Clegg will launch the Lib Dems' fight back today announcing plans for 'at least' £8 billion in tax rises if the Liberal Democrats remain in government after the election.

The Deputy PM will throw down the gauntlet to David Cameron and Ed Miliband by ruling out an increase in the headline rates of VAT, income tax or National Insurance – the three biggest money-spinners for the Treasury.

The move comes less than 24 hours after the independent Institute for Fiscal Studies warned that families face a major tax bombshell regardless of who wins the election.

The Lib Dems have so far announced just less than £2.5 billion of tax rises, including the £1.7 billion Mansion Tax on homes worth more than £2 million. It also plans to scrap the Married Couples Tax Allowance introduced by David Cameron, and increase the charges on wealthy foreign non-doms who live in the UK.

Sources said the party was also working up proposals on the tax deductibility of interest by businesses and on increasing the annual banking levy, which the party believes could raise at least £1.5 billion.

A source close to Mr Clegg said details of a further £4 billion in taxes would be set out ahead of the election, although it is unclear whether details of how the Mansion Tax will work will be ready in time.

In a speech in London today, the Lib Dem leader will say his party would target those who are 'not always paying their fair share' as it seeks to balance the books after the general election in May.

Like the Conservatives, the Lib Dems are committed to a further £30 billion of austerity in the new parliament in order to clear the deficit in the public finances by 2017/18.

But, while the Conservatives want to focus exclusively on cuts to benefits and public spending, the Lib Dems insist tax rises must also play a part.

Mr Clegg will say: 'We will finish the job of balancing the books but we will finish the job fairly.

'It is incomprehensible to most people that you would try and balance the books without asking for a contribution from the wealthiest people in our country.

'Liberal Democrat plans are for a bigger tax contribution from those who can afford to pay - the wealthiest individuals and big businesses which are not always paying their fair share.

'If public services and the most vulnerable in society are to be protected, then the wealthiest and big business will have to pay their fair share.'

In addition, the Lib Dems say they will raise £16 billion through cutting spending - including £4 billion of welfare savings - and £6 billion through reducing tax avoidance.

Welfare cuts include ending free TV licences and the winter fuel allowance for better-off pensioners and capping increases in benefit payments to one per cent for the first two years of the new parliament.
