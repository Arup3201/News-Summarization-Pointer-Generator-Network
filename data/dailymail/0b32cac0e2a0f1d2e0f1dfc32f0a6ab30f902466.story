A man wearing an Afghan army uniform today killed two French NATO service members after turning his weapon against them.

The members of the French Foreign Legion were killed in eastern Afghanistan. It is not yet known whether the attacker escaped.

French President Nicolas Sarkozy said he learned of the deaths 'with great sadness' and offered his condolences to their loved ones.

The shooting appeared to be the latest in a series of attacks by members of the Afghan security forces against their coalition partners.

Such attacks have raised fears of increased Taliban infiltration of the Afghan police and army as NATO speeds up the training of the security forces.

The killing comes on the same day as a roadside bombing killed 10 police officers and wounded one other in southwestern Helmand province.

A spokesman for the provincial governor, Daud Ahmadi, and police chief Haji Abdul Marjan said today's explosion destroyed a police pick-up truck as it drove through Zarghun Kalay village in Helmand's Nad Ali district.

Both officials said the officers had left a training centre and were headed home when their vehicle struck the bomb.

Marjan said they drove along the same road every day, with eight of those killed being new recruits.

Nad Ali, which had been run by British troops, was one of the districts in Helmand that last month transitioned, under much fanfare, from NATO to Afghan security control.

In 2010, a rogue Afghan soldier believed to be a 'trusted comrade' who regularly acted as a go-between to settle disagreements among British and Afghan forces betrayed British troops when he turned on them.

Talib Hussein, 23, killed three members of the 1st Battalion The Royal Gurkha Rifles when he launched a brutal attack at Patrol Base Three, a dusty fortress near Bababi in central Helmand, with a machinegun and a rocket-propelled grenade under cover of darkness.

He shot dead Major James Bowman's in his tent as he slept.

He then killed Lt Neal Turkington and senior Nepalese Gurkha soldier Corporal Arjun Purja Pun by firing a rocket-propelled grenade at the shipping container used as the base's operations room.

The handover was the second step in a transition that President Hamid Karzai hopes will leave Afghan forces in control of the entire country by the end of 2014, when the U.S.-led coalition's combat mission is scheduled to end.

The shooting follows an incident last week when an Afghan soldier opened fire on coalition troops inside an outpost in western Herat province, wounding a number of alliance troops. The attacker was killed.

NATO's training mission hopes have about 350,000 troops trained and ready by the end of 2014.

Eastern Afghanistan has become the focus of coalition efforts against insurgents, who infiltrate into Afghanistan across the rugged frontier from safe havens in neighbouring Pakistan.

The U.S. and its allies have asked Pakistan to crack down on the safe haves in that country's lawless tribal areas, but relations between the two militaries have reached rock bottom following a NATO cross-border attack that killed 24 Pakistani soldiers last month.

The two NATO deaths bring December's toll of foreign troops killed in Afghanistan to 25, for a total of 541 so far this year.

This year has been the most deadly for French forces in Afghanistan since an international operation began there in 2001.

The deaths bring to 78 the number of troops France has lost in the conflict.
