The Football Association today admitted it must do more to tackle racism in football as it prepares to interrogate John Terry over allegedly abusing rival player Anton Ferdinand.

A report by a powerful committee of MPs today warned problems still exist with racism in the game, with Twitter acting as a new platform for abuse.

Next week Terry will face an independent panel after he was charged by the FA of using racially abusive language towards Ferdinand last October. He denies the charge.

He was found not guilty by Westminster Magistrates Court in a criminal trial, but faces another fight to clear his name next week after being charged by FA chiefs.

Tory MP John Whittingdale, chairman of the culture, media and sport committee, said: ‘Recent incidents of racist abuse in the UK, both on and off the pitch, have highlighted the fact that there remain significant problems.’

He said social media has become a ‘tool for the spread of racist and abusive content, but it is also a potential means of combating the ignorance and prejudice that lie behind such behaviour’.

Football authorities should use online forum to spread ‘positive messages’ about equality and diversity, he added.

‘More needs to be done to increase the diversity of the pool of candidates for coaches and referees, to embed the values of equality and diversity at all levels of the game.’

In response to the committee’s report, the FA said much progress had been made to tackle racism in the game but there remained room for improvement.

In a statement the FA said: ‘We agree with the Committee that whilst substantial progress has been made to promote equality and tackle discrimination in the game, challenges remain for all of the football authorities.

‘We remain committed, along with all of our stakeholders, to promoting equality and diversity within the game and to the eradication of all forms of discrimination in football.

‘We will continue to work across the entire breadth of the sport to deliver our inclusion and anti-discrimination agenda. In doing so, we will consider in detail how the Committee’s recommendations can support and influence this work.’

The report also called for more candidates from ethnic minorities to be trained as coaches and referees, with more transparent recruitment of managers and directors to encourage greater ethnic diversity.

But it stopped short of recommending the Rooney Rule be adopted - the system used in American football in the NFL where shortlists for any head coach or senior management vacancy have to have at least one ethnic minority candidate.

Piara Powar, executive director of European anti-discrimination network FARE, said the MPs had missed an opportunity to set out clear ways of achieving more black managers and coaches.

Powar said: ‘There have been headline issues that English football has experienced over the last year, the Luis Suarez and John Terry cases, and those are very big issues that we need to deal with.

‘But the report had no clear direction on diversity hiring practices.

“We now have less racism in football because people respect the achievements of black players but where is their role in the game as coaches and managers. Football needs to be given the lead.

‘We have a significant Asian population in Britain but where are the Asian players?'
