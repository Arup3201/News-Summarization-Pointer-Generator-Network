An American Airlines plane carrying about 200 people suffered four blown tyres when it landed safely at one of South America’s busiest airports this week.

The Boeing 767-300 had just touched down at Rio de Janeiro/Galeao-Antonio Carlos Jobim International Airport when the tyres burst.

Instead of coming to a stop so it could be towed, the aircraft taxied to the terminal, leaving a trail of light smoke and surface damage as the tyres disintegrated.

Helicopter pilot Jose Nonato Coutinho captured video of the incident and posted it on YouTube, where the clip has had more than 30,000 hits.

He said the twin-engine plane arrived at the terminal moments after he landed his helicopter on Tuesday.

Flight AA251 had just completed a 10-hour journey from American Airlines’ base at Dallas/Fort Worth International Airport in Texas.

 As it taxied to the terminal the blown tyres left a trail of smoke and surface damage as they disintegrated

All four tyres on the right main landing gear were destroyed and its rims were exposed, leaving scratch marks on the tarmac.

The Aviation Herald said an onward flight to John F Kennedy International Airport was cancelled and the plane was still on the ground in Rio de Janeiro the following day.

MailOnline Travel has contacted American Airlines for comment.
