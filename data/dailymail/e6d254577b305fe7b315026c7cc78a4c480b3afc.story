If you’re bored of hard-boiled eggs having a yellow centre and a white exterior, then you’ll want to pay attention to this wacky recipe for inside out eggs.

A Japanese chef revealed a method to reverse the colour of your eggs in a YouTube video.

Using a few bits of equipment found around your home - including a pair of tights and a torch - you too can enjoy the novelty of a boiled egg that has its white albumen on the inside, and its yellow yolk on the outside.

We're not yolking: A Japanese chef has revealed how to turn an egg inside out (image of final egg shown). In a bizarre video he shows how spinning it can reverse the colour. First, you need to tape up the egg, and then spin it in a pair of tights. Then, by boiling the egg, the yolk should appear on the outside

In the video Yama Chaahan explains how to perform this piece of cooking trickery by spinning the egg and then boiling it.

What you'll need: An egg, clear tape, a torch, a pair of tights and ice cubes.

1. Check the colour of your egg with a torch

2. Put tape around the whole shell of the egg

3. Wrap it in the middle a pair of tights

4. Spin it round for a few minutes by holding either end of the tights

5. Check on the colour again. It should be darker than in step one

6. Take the egg out of the tights and place it in boiling water with the tape still on

7. Once boiled, remove the egg and place it in a bowl of ice for a minute

8. Now peel the shell, and you should now have an inside out egg. If the whole thing is yellow, try it again but spin it for longer.

The science behind it is that the yolk of the egg is more dense than the albumen.

When you spin the egg rapidly, the runny yolk is drawn towards the edge of the egg via the centrifugal force, while the albumen is pushed to the centre.

If you spin the egg for long enough, the yolk and albumen separate, so that when boiled the egg appears inside out.

If you don’t spin it for long enough, the two mix so that you get an instant scrambled egg.

To get started, you’ll need a pair of tights, some clear tape, a torch, ice cubes and, of course, an egg.

First, hold the torch up to the egg to check on its colour. The egg should glow. This will be important for later.

Now, get your tape and completely encapsulate the egg, ensuring that the shell will remain strong and in one piece for the next few steps.

Next, lay out your pair of tights, and wrap your egg in the middle of them. Twist it up at either end so it is secure; you may want to use small ties or bits of string to keep it in place.

The reason the egg appears inside out is that the yolk is denser, so the centrifugal force moves it to the outside of the albumen when the egg is spun. This can make a change from regular eggs with their white albumen on the outside and yolk on the inside (stock image shown)

Once done you’ll want to hold either end of the tights and spin the egg around for a few minutes.

Using your torch, you need to check on the colour of the egg - when it looks much darker than it did at the start, you’re ready to get cooking.

Remove the egg from the tights but keep it wrapped in tape, and place it in boiling water.

Leave it in there for a few minutes until it is boiled, then take the egg out and put it in a bowl of ice for a few minutes.

Now, peel back the tape and the shell, and you should find that the first thing you’ll see is a yellow egg, rather than a white one.

Cutting open the egg should then reveal the white albumen at the middle, surrounded by the yolk on the outside.

If you find that the whole egg is yellow, rather than just the outer layer, this is because it hasn’t been spun long enough.

If you try it again, keep spinning the egg for a few minutes when it is wrapped in the tights.

You should now have a method to amaze dinner guests with a culinary delight - or play a practical joke on others.
