It is one of the most popular winter sun spots for Britons in the world and has seen unprecedented development in the last decade.

As one of Dubai's most iconic hotels turns 10, it has compiled some unusual facts for travellers, from its driverless metro system to the largest man-made island in the world.

In just a decade, the population of Dubai has doubled, which is the equivalent of 300 new people arriving in the emirate to live each day, according to the five-star Madinat Jumeirah hotel.

And the city is transporting more people too - from its increased airport capacity to its driverless metro system, which has transported over 443 million commuters since it launched in 2009.

That's more than the entire population of the Middle East.

The Burj Khalifa tower is the tallest building in the world, standing, at 2,716 feet, and towers so high that visitors at the top will be a whole 15 degrees cooler than those on the ground.

The Palm Jumeirah, which is a hotel that's part of the Madinat Jumeirah development, also sits on the world's largest man-made island - equal to more than 784 soccer fields. 

With 75 million people flocking through its airport each year, and the same number hitting the emirate's famous malls, as well as its annual art fair, which attracts 500 artists from all over the world, Dubai looks set to remain a holiday hotspot in the near future. 

To celebrate the 10th anniversary of the Madinat Jumeirah, the hotel has released this unique infographic

As such, the capacity of Dubai International Airport has also increased to accommodate visitors

Currently, the airport sees more passengers pass through than the entire population of both the UK and Greece

The traditional wooden boats used to transport guests at the hotel property have likewise grown in popularity

Over 3.3 million guests have been transported using these boats - that is 1.5x the population of Dubai

Madinat Jumeirah's Burj Al Arab was the first hotel in the world to surpass 1000ft in height when it opened

The hotel's atrium is so large that the Statue of Liberty could fit into it - twice!

At the top of the Burj Khalifa, the temperature is nearly 15 degrees cooler than at the base

Another of the resort's properties - the Palm Jumeirah - sits on the world's largest man-made island

In fact, the Palm's private island could fit 784 soccer fields on its 5.6 square km of area

The Madinat Jumeirah also hosts the region's largest contemporary art fair each year 

The art fair boasts over 500 artists, which is more than the number of painters on display at The Louvre

Madinat Jumeirah's turtle sanctuary has so far helped 700 turtles back into the ocean

That's impressive, considering that 700 turtles account for 10% of all nesting Hawksbill turtles worldwide
