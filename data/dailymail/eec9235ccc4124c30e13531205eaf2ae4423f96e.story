Liverpool's glamour clash with Real Madrid did not turn into the nightmare some had envisaged after news of Brendan Rodgers’ dramatic team selection emerged.

An intriguing 90 minutes ended, with Karim Benzema having netted the goal which separated the sides, and the game produced a number of talking points, most notably the performances of the players who Rodgers chose to go with in the Bernabeu Stadium. 

Here Sportsmail analyses five issues that arose during the Group B contest and looks at whether the night has the potential to be a turning point in a campaign that has stuttered and spluttered during the opening months.

Brendan Rodgers made seven changes to the team that started on the weekend against Newcastle United

1) Kolo Toure cannot lose his place against Chelsea

If there were fears beforehand that Toure’s presence in Liverpool’s defence would be the catalyst for a Madrid goal spree, they were soon dispelled. The Ivorian has been derided during his time on Merseyside for his tendency to make spectacular mistakes but, here, he didn’t put a foot wrong.

Another big test looms against Chelsea but if Rodgers was to bring Dejan Lovren back, it would be grossly unfair. The manager may see Lovren as a future leader of his defence but the start to his Liverpool career has been underwhelming. There is reason to feel he was dropped not rested.

Toure, by contrast, has not done badly when he has been called upon - apart from one aberration when conceding a penalty in the Capital One Cup defeat of Middlesbrough - and he dealt with Cristiano Ronaldo et al confidently. He deserves the chance now to shackle Diego Costa.

2) Simon Mignolet could have turned the corner

Pressure has been building on Mignolet and if Liverpool had struck an agreement with Victor Valdes, who they had been tracking since the summer, he would have faced a major fight to preserve his status as No 1.

Mignolet’s performances have been erratic, anxious even, and his failure to command the penalty area, to exude authority, have caused jitters to spread. The intensity of the Bernabeu could have tipped him over the edge but the Belgium international responded impressively.

Two fine stops in the first 10 minutes from James Rodriguez and Ronaldo set him up and, for once, he looked ready to go to war with his defenders, barking his displeasure if their concentration dipped. The scrutiny will not go away but this display may bolster his fragile confidence.

3) Alberto Moreno is the pick of Liverpool’s summer spending spree

There has been scrutiny on how better off Liverpool are for their heavy transfer expenditure - rightly so - but, with each game, Moreno is making his £12million acquisition look smart business. The toing and froing with Sevilla to broker a deal appears worthwhile.

Back in familiar surrounds, the Spain Under-21 international was accomplished from first whistle to last, covering miles up and down the left flank. He showed discipline to stick to his task defensively but also added weight to Liverpool’s attack, delivering some fine crosses.

He has been culpable for some of the goals conceded so far - think Newcastle United on Saturday and Manchester City on his debut spring to mind - but once Liverpool polish his rough edges, Moreno will be a gem. Real Madrid versus Liverpool was an occasion in which he was at home.

4) Criticism of Rodgers must be given perspective

The radio phone-ins on Saturday evening made for illuminating listening. Vexed by the manner of the loss at Newcastle, a flurry of callers to 606 unleashed their fury on Rodgers and suggested his time at Anfield was up. This, of course, is the way of the modern world.

Rodgers again found himself under fire for making eight changes in the Bernabeu - this observer’s view is that it was far too many and could have backfired spectacularly. He must appreciate why there was such uproar, given the fixture. It created the perception this was a distraction.

High up in the stands, though, Liverpool’s travelling supporters gave frequent and noisy backing to their manager, reminding him of their affection. Rodgers must prove himself this season and show what happened in the last campaign was no fluke but Anfield’s masses have faith in his project.

5) Steven Gerrard’s status as one of world football’s top stars is undiminished

Rodgers had his reasons for using Gerrard from the bench but the game was poorer without his presence from the first whistle. That said, the moment he was summoned to the action produced a marvellous reaction from the home supporters.

Gerrard, who had spoken warmly about Real Madrid before the first Group B game, was given a standing ovation when he entered the fray, a sign from Bernabeu regulars that they have recognised and appreciated all he has achieved through his career.

Liverpool plan to open formal contract talks with him soon and Rodgers does not want to lose his captain. If, though, for some reason they carelessly allowed him to leave, plenty of top clubs would be ready to take him. Madrid’s fans showed how well he would be received in Spain.
