A Turkish Airlines flight has been forced into an emergency landing after a note with the word 'bomb' was reportedly found in the toilet.

The flight from Istanbul scheduled for Sao Paulo, Brazil touched down in Casablanca, Morocco after declaring an emergency over North Africa.

The airline confirmed the Boeing 777 with the flight number TK15 was carrying 256 people and made a diversion due to a 'bomb threat'.

The action on board was reported by Istanbul-based journalist Erdem Arda Güneş

Istanbul-based journalist Erdem Arda Güneş claimed on Twitter that the diversion was due to a bomb scare after a note was discovered in the plane's toilet.

The airline has not yet confirmed the bomb threat was made using a note in the toilet.

However, Turkish Airlines said it is standard procedure to make an emergency landing if a threat is issued.

MailOnline Travel has contacted Turkish Airlines for further comment and is awaiting a response.

No further information was immediately available. 

It is the second incident in two days where a Turkish Airlines flight out of Istanbul has been the subject of a bomb threat.

Yesterday flight TK-52 from Istanbul to Tokyo was forced to land at Ataturk Airport after the words 'C4-Cargo' were discovered written in the toilet.

The words relate to the plastic explosive C-4.

BGN News reported that the words were discovered by the cabin crew. They alerted the pilot who sent out a signal to make an emergency landing.

After the passengers were evacuated after landing, a full sweep took place involving mobile technology, but no threat was discovered.
