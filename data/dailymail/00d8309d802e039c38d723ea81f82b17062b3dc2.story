For dozens of years, cinema-fans have been charmed by the notion of tapping your heels together three times to go home.

Now artist Dominic Wilcox has combined cinema nostalgia with high-tech wizardry by combining shoes with a GPS circuit-board and blinking LED lights to point you in the right direction.

And, true to form, tapping your heels together will always guide you home.

There's no place like home: Dominic Wilcox, inspired by the Wizard of Oz, has designed shoes with GPS built-in, to always guide you home

Walk this way: The shoes contain LEDs which point you in the right direction and give you a progress bar gauge

Magic shoes: The 1939 classic gets some 2012 technology

Sunderland-born artist Dominic Wilcox, who has gained an MA at the Royal College of Art, is currently displaying his creation at KK Outlet in Shoreditch, London.

Dominic said: 'I decided to make a pair of shoes that can navigate you 
home where ever you are. I thought about the Wizard of Oz and how 
Dorothy could click her shoes together to go home.'

He
was commissioned by Global Footprint, a visual arts and living heritage
group based in Northamptonshire - which itself has a long heritage in 
footwear, including the headquarters of Dr Martens and Barkers.

The shoes come with PC software and a USB
cable, so that, once you have got home and tried your shoes on, you can
then simply upload your home address, and from then on your shoes will 
tell you which way to walk.

The GPS antenna is embedded in the heal of the left shoe, which also contains a ring of LEDs, which form a compass.

The shoe meanwhile communicates wirelessly with the right shoe, which contains a progress bar, showing you how much further you need to stroll.

These are not the only shoes coming out with GPS.

Another pair aims to help Alzheimer's victims - a £200 pair with GPS which allows its wearer’s location to be accurately pinpointed.

The GPS system, which is implanted in the heel of what appears to be a normal walking shoe, allows family members or carers to constantly monitor the wearer.
