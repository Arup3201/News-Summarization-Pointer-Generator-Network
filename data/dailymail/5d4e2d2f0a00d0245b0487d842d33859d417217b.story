Gwyneth Paltrow, who once studied Kabbalah with her former best friend, Madonna, has taken a trip down memory lane in her latest beauty campaign - and the results are amazing.

The 41-year-old, has recreated some of the most influential beauty looks of the past, from Audrey Hepburn and Brigitte Bardot to Farrah Fawcett and none other than Madonna, who she had a falling out with in 2009.

Max Factor, the beauty giant that Gwynnie is the face of, gave the A-lister a fifties, sixties, seventies and eighties makeover with the help of creative design director and make-up artist to the stars, Pat McGrath, to celebrate its 100 Years of Glamour campaign.

'For me, Farrah Fawcett from the seventies appeals to me most. It was a decade of change in make-up; the birth of the beautiful sun-kissed tanned skin. I adore the soft colourful metallic hues that were used in abundance on lips, eyes and cheeks.

'Foundation was light and it really felt that radiance and energy was pumped into hair and make-up, giving the 70’s that feel of a new relaxed femininity and experimentation.'

Gwyneth, who 'consciously uncoupled' from Coldplay frontman Chris Martin recently, has been keeping busy since the split and was most recently spotted enjoying dinner with close friend and fellow A-lister, Cameron Diaz.
