When George Clooney suggested the Elgin Marbles be returned to Greece earlier this year, many chalked his interest  down to promoting his new film.

But the actor may have in fact taken inspiration from his human rights lawyer wife, who is aiding the Greek government with its bid to take back the artefacts from the British Museum. 

Amal Alamuddin Clooney will fly to  Athens to aid discussions as to how best to secure the Marbles' return next week at the request of the Greek prime minister.

The actor suggested the artefacts 'found their way back' to Greece while promoting his film The Monuments Men earlier this year. His human rights lawyer wife (left) is reportedly due to fly to Greece to aid talks  

The 36-year-old will be joined by her colleague, Geoffrey Robertson QC, who secured the return of the remains of Tasmanian Aborigines  from the Natural History Museum in 2006.

It comes after her Hollywood husband spoke in favour of the Greeks' plea for the Marbles to be returned to Athens from Britain while promoting The Monuments Men in February. 

The film is based on a group of allied men and women who saved historic European art from the destructive force of the Nazis during the Second World War. 

At a press conference in Greece, Mr Clooney, 53, was asked whether he sided with his hosts or with Britain when it came to the Elgin Marbles, sold to the British government by Lord Elgin in 1816.

The artefacts have remained at the British Museum since, but are considered by some to be the property of the Greeks who have tirelessly fought for their return.

'I think you have a very good case to make about your artefacts.  I don't think it would be a bad thing if they were returned,' Mr Clooney told a journalist. 

Later, at a press conference at London's National Gallery, he said while he was not an expert in the matter, he felt the Marbles ought to 'find their way back'. 

Clooney made the comments while promoting his film The Monuments Men in which he and Matt Damon (pictured) are among a group of men and women who protect European art from the destructive Nazis during the Second World War

'Even in England the polling is in favour of returning the Marbles of the Pantheon (sic). 

'It's one of those. There are certain pieces that you look at and you think, that actually, probably would be the right thing to do.'

The Elgin Marbles refers to a collection of stone objects acquired by Lord Elgin while he was ambassador to the Ottoman court of the Sultan in Istanbul. 

After an explosion in the ancient building, built as a shrine to the goddess Athena, many of the sculptures could not have been reattached to the walls they were originally part of. 

With the permission of the Ottoman, Lord Elgin removed around half of the pieces for his own collection. 

Among them was a series of inscriptions which he sold to the British Parliament in 1816.   

It was presented to the British Museum, and has remained there since. 

Parts of the Marbles are also displayed at the Louvre and the Vatican, as well as in museums in Copenhagen, Vienna, Wurzburg and Munich. 

Since the early Eighties, the Greek government has appealed to the British Museum to return its part of the Marbles. 

Almost half of the surviving sculptures are shown at the Acropolis Museum in Athens.  

His comments sparked outrage among British politicians who suggested he did not understand the complexity of the situation. 

John Whittingdale, the chairman of the culture, media and sport committee said at the time: 'I'm a great admirer of George Clooney, but I suspect that he probably doesn't know the history of the Elgin Marbles and the legal entitlement that Britain has to them.' 

Today, a spokesman for Doughty Street Chambers, where Mrs Alamuddin Clooney works, confirmed she had been asked to advise the Greek government on the matter. 

'Doughty Street barristers Geoffrey Robertson QC and Amal Alamuddin Clooney will be conducting a visit to Athens on 13-16 October 2014 at the invitation of the Greek government in connection with the Parthenon sculptures that are presently on display in the British Museum.

'In 2006 Mr Robertson led the legal initiative which required the Natural History Museum to return the remains of Tasmanian Aborigines.

'Mr Robertson and Mrs Clooney were first asked to provide legal advice to the Greek government on this matter in 2011. 

'They will be holding a series of meetings with government officials during their stay, including the Prime Minister, Mr Antonis Samaras, and the Minister of Culture, Mr Konstantinos Tasoulas,' a statement said. 

The British Museum this morning said it had no knowledge of any new efforts to have the artefact removed. 

'We're not aware of any new developments and we've certainly not been contacted. 

'As far as we are aware there is no change in the situation,' a spokesman said.
