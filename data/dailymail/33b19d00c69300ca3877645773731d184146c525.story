Fans of one of Brazil's biggest football teams will be able to show their allegiance for all eternity after the club confirmed plans to open a dedicated cemetery for their supporters.

Sao Paulo-based club Corinthians say up to 70,000 plots will be made available for fans in the 'Corinthians Forever' graveyard which is due to open in 2015.

The vast complex will also become the final resting place of legendary players as the club announced  the remains of up to 100 recognised figures from Corinthians history will be moved there. 

For whom the final whistle tolls: Fanatical Corinthians fans can now choose to be buried alongside club legends at the team's official graveyard

Plots will cost between $1,870 (£1,169) and $3,240 (£2,027) depending on the area of the complex selected and proximity to club idols who will also be laid to rest at the site. 

Corinthians, or Sport Club Corinthians Paulista, are one of the most famous names in Brazilian football, winning five national titles in their 104-year history, one Copa Libertadores and two FIFA Club World Cups. 

Taking their name from the famous amateur side Corinthian, they were founded in 1910 after the English side blitzed all before them on a tour of Brazil.

Idols: Late club legends Teleco, left, and Socrates, right. It is not known whether they will be among the 100 figures from Corinthians history to be moved to the new graveyard

The club, which is historically left-wing due to its founding by immigrant labourers, has had its fair share of legends plying their trade at the 40,000 Pacaembu Stadium. Most notable was Socrates.

The Brazilian captain from the magical national side of 1982 was in his pomp for Corinthians between 1978 and 1984. He passed away in 2011.

The Doctor was inspirational on and off the pitch, where he would often wear a shirt printed with 'Democracia' in protest at the military government running the country at the time.

Before him there was Roberto Rivelino, famed for taking trickery to a new level and having a powerful left foot.

The attacking midfielder was christened 'King of the Park' by fans after coming through the youth ranks in 1965 and featuring for the next nine years.

He infamously played in the shock state final defeat to Palmeiras in 1974 in what turned out to be last game.

The fans made him a scapegoat and never forgave him, accusing him of bringing bad luck in an era where the club went without a state trophy between 1954 and 1977. 

The cemetery will also include function rooms, landscaped gardens, a restaurant and a lake and nature reserve, said Ricardo Polito, chief executive of the company in charge of the construction.
