Apocalyptic snowfall over upstate New York that has killed 13 people is set to bring even further misery as the area is hit by warmer temperatures and rain over the weekend.

More buildings could collapse and flooding devastate the area as chilling downpours soak into the feet-thick blanket of snow already coating most of the buildings in the area around Buffalo. Officials have predicted waters six feet deep will hit parts of the area.

The town has already experienced almost a year's worth of snow in just a few days - in the worst-hit areas 7 feet of powder has fallen, close to the yearly average of 8 feet.

Thirteen people have died in the bout of lake-effect snow around Buffalo and Erie county, either from exposure to the chilling weather or through heart attacks caused by trying to shovel the snow away.

More than 30 roof collapses, most involving farm and flat-roof buildings, were reported overnight, officials said Friday. Due to the high snow risk, buildings in Buffalo are required to be able to support 50 pounds per square foot on their roofs - but according to experts this limit has almost been breached.

Widespread travel bans are in effect in darkness hours around the area, and the intense snowfall has forced the Buffalo Bills NFL team to cancel a home game Sunday and move it to Detroit for Monday instead. 

Little or no extra snow is due, but forecasts predicting rising temperatures of up to 60 degrees could bring further danger for the area, along with forecast rain for Saturday and Monday.

At a news conference Friday, Erie County Executive Marc Poloncarz warned that floods are likely to hit in a few days' time and could cause even worst damage.

New York Governor Andrew Cuomo said the weather was of national significance and has caught the attention of President Obama. He said: 'The President himself sends us his best wishes - he was concerned with the situation... He's thinking abvout us and he cares about us.'

He also said that officials will likely seek funding from the Federal Emergency Management Agency (Fema) to pay for some of the damage, expected to reach the tens of millions.

According to officials, 5,000 people, some 200 snowplows and thousands of trucks were working to clear the snow from the worst-hit areas.

Homeowners and store employees around the region climbed onto roofs Thursday to shovel off the snow and reduce the danger.

'It's getting heavier,' said Cheektowaga resident Thomas Mudd Jr., who with his wife spent several hours shoveling 4 to 5 feet off their roof. 'It's supposed to warm up and we're supposed to get rain on the weekend, which will make it even heavier. So I didn't want my roof collapsing.'

Bellevue Fire Department Lt. Timothy Roma said more than a dozen buildings and carports collapsed, as did a metal warehouse operated by a Christmas decorations company, where damage was estimated in the millions.

Some 180 residents of a Cheektowaga assisted living facility were evacuated after staff members noticed the ceiling bulging under the weight of the snow.

With roads impassable, driving bans in effect and the Buffalo Bills' stadium buried in snow, the NFL decided to move the Bills' Sunday home game against the New York Jets to Monday night in Detroit.

National Guardsmen drove nurses to their hospital shifts. State troopers helped elderly residents trapped in their homes. State officials assembled 463 plows, 129 loaders and 40 dump trucks from across the state for a massive cleanup effort.

Some Buffalo-area schools were closed for the fourth day, burning through snow days with winter still a month away.
