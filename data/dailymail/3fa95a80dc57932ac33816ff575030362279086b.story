New imagery released by NASA this week further reinforced the destructive power of the storms that struck the town of Pilger, Nebraska, literally carving paths into the ground that are visible from space. 

In a comparison of images taken from The Advanced Spaceborne Thermal Emission and Reflection Radiometer (otherwise known as ASTER) instrument aboard NASA's Terra satellite, the paths that the two tornadoes that touched down in the area took can be seen.

The first image, taken July 4, shows the area one week before the July 16 tornadoes took place. The next image was taken on July 21, and show marks on the ground similar to scratch marks on a surface. The scars on the ground are colored gray on the map, while the town of Pilger is colored white.

According to NASA, the tornadoes were both rated EF-4 on the Enhanced Fujita scale, entailing that the storms carried violent winds ranging from 166 to 200 miles per hour.

One of the tornadoes passed through the small town of Pilger, which has a population of 355. The storm leveled the town, killing a five-year-old girl as well as an elderly man.

According to experts, the storms that ransacked Pilger are exceedingly rare, in that incidences of a twin tornado as strong as the one in Pilger do not often occur.

'I've been here at the University Corporation for Atmospheric Research [a weather consortium based in Boulder, Colorado] for 16 years,' atmospheric scientist Jeff Weber told NBC News. 'I've seen all 
sorts of weather, but I've never seen the data for two tornadoes at the 
same time like this.'

According to Weber, the twin tornado phenomena like experienced in Pilger occurs 'every 10 to 20 years.'

A video released on Thursday also captured the carnage from space, this time thanks to a satellite belonging to NOAA.

The NOAA-GOES East satellite took images of the cloud formations over Nebraska and the eastern portion of the United States, showing how massive the storm systems became before breaking up into different pieces. The video covered from June 16 until June 23, starting with the Pilger tornadoes and ending with storm systems that caused flooding in areas located off of the Mississippi River.

The June 16 storms laid waste a majority of the town,  heavily damaging or destroying up to 75 per cent of the buildings in 
Pilger. The tornado crushed much of 
the small downtown, leaving piles of bricks that had been storefronts in
 the street.

The grain bins that decorated the center of the town were demolished, crushed like soda cans by the storm's power.

Between 45 and 50 homes in Pilger were demolished, about a dozen others were damaged beyond repair in Dixon County.
