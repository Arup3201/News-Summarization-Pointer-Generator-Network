Serial rapist: Christopher Hubbart, 63, will be moving in next to Sharon Duvernay after being released from a psychiatric 

A woman who was snatched from her garden and raped by her neighbour when she was just three years old has been left 'terrified' by news a sex offender will be moving in next door.

Nearly 60 years after the terrifying attack, retired school teacher Sharon Duvernay, now 62, will be living in the same neighbourhood as the 'Pillowcase Rapist,' - a vile criminal responsible for at least 40 attacks in the 1970s and 1980s.

Christopher Hubbart, 63, will be released from a psychiatric facility in California before moving to a home in the rural, isolated community of Lake Los Angeles, according to Fox News.

He will live in a small, one-story house and will be the closest resident to Mrs Duvernay, who lives on five acres of land. 

Fearing she could become the victim of another traumatic attack, she said she is going to buy guard dogs and upgrade her security system.

Her other neighbours are also considering putting up barbed-wire fences and better lights. 

While the local police department have pledged to do all they can to ensure safety, residents are daunted by the rapist's imminent.

Hubbart earned his grim nickname for the vile method of his crimes.

He would bind victims' hands before pulling pillowcases over their heads to silence their screams.

The move has brought back memories to Mrs Duvernay of when she was raped in 1955 outside her New Orleans family home.

She said: 'The pain never goes away. I don't think about it everyday but certainly with him coming I do...I'm terrified.

'It's just so ironic. His patterns are exactly like the guy who attacked me. We tried to do everything within the law to keep him from moving here.

'We collected more than 12,000 letters to the judge.'

Mrs Duvernay also believes her daily routine will become more difficult, as she will need to be on high alert while carrying out chores, such as taking out the trash.

Hubbart has been in a mental health facility since 1996. 

Los Angeles County District Attorney Jackie Lacey petitioned the state Supreme Court in July 2013 to block his release, but the court denied her request, prompting widespread protests from residents.

New neighbourhood: He will be moving into this area in Lake Los Angeles, 17 miles east of Palmdale, California
