Gareth Bale has set a new record after being voted Welsh footballer of the year for the fourth time.

Both Mark Hughes and John Hartson individually received the Football Association of Wales award on three occasions but no man has previously been named Welsh player of the year four times.

The Real Madrid star retained the trophy at the FAW awards dinner at Cardiff's St David's Hotel and has now won it four times during the past five years.

Bale's incredible year saw him win the Champions League, the UEFA Super Cup and the Copa del Rey for Real, while his performances for Wales have also caught the eye.

The 25-year-old scored both goals in Wales' opening Euro 2016 qualifier last month, a 2-1 win in Andorra, and has now scored 10 times in his last 11 internationals.

Bale also picked up the Vauxhall fans' player of the year trophy for the fourth year in succession, while three more of the main awards were retained by last year's winners.

Swans skipper Ashley Williams was again rewarded for his sterling performances at the Liberty Stadium by winning the club player of the year award for the fourth year on the trot.

Wales captain Jess Fishlock also retained her crown as women's player of the year for the fourth time in succession.

Angharad James was named young player of the year and Cardiff City's Michelle Green, who made her Wales debut in 2001 and has won 95 caps, was recognised as the club player of the year.

Scott Ruscoe was named Welsh Premier clubman of the year after making over 250 appearances for The New Saints since joining them 14 years ago.

Two FAW long service awards were made with former Wales skipper Kevin Ratcliffe taking the accolade for the men's game and Swansea City Ladies secretary Julie Lowe for the women's game.

A special award was also made to Jamo Matikainen, who recently finished managing the Wales women's team after four years to return to Finland.
