It's well known that at times you may have to suffer for your art. But for diver Tony Neal there’s one inspiring picture that has well and truly got under his skin.

The underwater photographer so liked an image taken of him swimming over a wreck that he endured more than 30 hours of extreme agony to have the image recreated in stunning detail on his back.

The picture, taken by fellow underwater photographer Alex Mustard, shows Mr Neal hovering above the sunken Royal Navy submarine  HMS E49 during a trip to the Shetlands in 2011. The E49 sank after hitting a mine in March 1917.

There were no survivors.

Underwater photographer Tony Neal was photographed by Alex Mustard above the wreck of the submarine E49 during a trip to the Shetlands in 2011. Tony has spent two years having the image recreated as a tattoo by artist Kirsty Peake, spending around 30 hours under the needle as the ink was added

Diver: Tony Neal (pictured) wanted the tattoo as a reminder of the dive and as a tribute to his father, John

Mr Neal, from Northampton, had the scene recreated in amazing detail by tattoo artist Kirsty Peake and ‘framed’ in an outline of an  oxygen tank.

It took Kirsty several sessions spread over two years to complete the amazing blue and green tattoo.

Mr Neal wanted it both to remember the dive and as a memorial to his dying father John, a former police officer.

He said: ‘My dad had just found out he had cancer when I was about to go diving in the Shetlands, but he insisted I continue. When he saw Alex’s beautiful photograph of me in a diving magazine, his whole face lit up. Sadly he died last Christmas, aged 63, but the tattoo will always remind me of him.’

Mr Neal admitted the process had been ‘excruciatingly painful’.

The blue ink was inserted into his skin with a ‘magnum’  tattoo needle – 49 points bunched together.

He added: ‘I am glad to have done it, but I have no plans to have another one.’
