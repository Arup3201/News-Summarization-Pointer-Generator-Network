A group of patients who criticised their local GP surgery on Facebook   have been told to consider finding a new doctor in an attempt to stifle negative feedback online.

Staff at the Trent Meadows Medical Practice near Burton, Staffordshire, had been monitoring social media comments and culprits have since been sent 'threatening' letters.

Sylvia Blackshaw, 35, had written   that on three occasions she waited for 90 minutes for an appointment for her newborn baby.

But she was later accused of abusive behaviour by the surgery who branded it 'inappropriate patient behaviour' and warned her that she should consider finding an 'alternative practice'.

Spark: Surgery staff were obviously monitoring comments on Facebook and sent a letter on the back of this one

Mrs Blackshaw had said 'OMG. Demand a recount!' in a comment on a glowing report for the surgery from health watchdog the Care Quality Commission on her local paper's Facebook page. 

A fortnight later a  letter sent to her home from the surgery said: 'We have a zero tolerance for inappropriate patient behaviour which is either face to face, over the telephone or on social media networks and do not accept this from our patients.'

A copy of her Facebook criticism was also attached. 

Warning: This letter from GP partner Judith Crosse has also been sent to other critics

Several other patients  also received a letter.

Mrs Blackshaw said: 'On three occasions I have been left sat in the waiting room for an hour and a half with a screaming newborn baby.

'When I saw that the surgery had been praised I was shocked. I don't rate them.

'We're mothers of young children living in the village. It's the only surgery. I think they should take the criticism and use it to make the surgery better.

'People might receive that threatening letter and think they are being chucked out.'

Another patient, Jenny Wheeldon, 34, was left upset by her letter, which came after she described months of poor service at the surgery in an online comment.

She said: 'I have had mistake after mistake. I didn't think what I put was bad. It's our opinion - that's what social media is for.'

Several more people say they have received the letter, signed by GP partner Dr Judith Cross, which argues that complaints should go through the proper channels.

The letter says: 'The partners at the practice are aware of your comments and how you feel. We have zero tolerance for inappropriate patient behaviour which is either face to face, over the telephone or on social media networks and do not accept this from our patients.'

The letter invites recipients to speak to the patient liaison manager and one of the GP partners, but adds 'in the absence of such a meeting, it is felt you might give consideration to finding an alternative practice to receive your general medical services'.

Response: The surgery's management says that it has a 'zero tolerance' on abuse and says patients should complain through them 

A spokesman for Trent Meadows surgery said he was unable to comment on individual cases but said that the letter was proportionate.

He said: 'While people do have a right to air their opinions on social media, practice staff feel we have a duty to protect the reputation of the practice from unfair criticism for the sake of our other patients and staff.

'Trent Meadows Medical Practice takes all patient comments seriously. If any patient has a concern or complaint, we offer the opportunity to contact the surgery through its complaints procedure.'

Trent Meadows was one of the first GP practices in the country to be inspected and awarded a rating of 'good' by the inspectors.
