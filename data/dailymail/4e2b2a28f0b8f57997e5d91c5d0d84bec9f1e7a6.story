The trademark white suit of Col Sanders has been sold to the head of KFC in Japan for $21,510.

After buying the suit and black string tie at Heritage Auctions in Dallas, Texas, Masao "Charlie" Watanabe tried it on for size.

The Japanese chief executive also bought other items of Sanders memorabilia, including the founder of the fried chicken chain's driver's Kentucky driver's license, which cost him $1,912.

The collector, who had been in Texas on business when he heard about the auction, was one of hundreds of bidders vying for memorabilia which also included a gun belt owned by Jesse James and the leg irons used to restrain the abolitionist John Brown.

'Every child in Japan knows Colonel Sanders' face and his uniform,' Mr Watanabe said.

Col Sanders is a popular figure in Japan, 
and most KFC restaurants in the country have statues of him, Mr Watanabe said.

He plans to display the suit, which comes with a clip on tie that did not belong to Col Sanders, at a restaurant in Tokyo.

Harland Sanders first started serving his famous chicken from a service station in Corbin, Kentucky, in 1930.Â 

As his fame grew, he was made an honorary colonel by the state's governor in 1935.

After perfecting his secret blend of herbs and spices he started a franchise which, in ten years, had grown to 600 restaurants.

Until his death at the age of 90, Col Sanders traveled the world visiting KFC restaurants.

According to Heritage Auctions, the suit was given to a teenager whose family had sold a house to Col Sanders in 1975. While the house sale was being completed, the Col shared their house.

On Hallowe'en, Mike Morris says Col Sanders gave him the trademark suit so he could go to a party dressed as the KFC founder.

Other items of American history were sold at the Texas auction on Saturday.

The leg irons clamped on Brown after his failed 1859 raid on a federal arsenal in Virginia was sold to an anonymous bidder for $13,145.

Many scholars believe Brown and his raid hastened the start of the Civil War as he tried to end slavery.

The Connecticut native and some followers seized the arsenal in an attempt to provide 100,000 weapons to slaves who never joined them. Brown was hanged for treason, murder and inciting a rebellion.

The auction house also sold one of the two gun belts owned by Jesse James at the time of his death. It went for $16,730.
