David Cameron was accused of trying to stage-manage Prime Minister’s Questions last night, after leaked emails revealed Tory MPs are routinely pressured to ask him easy questions.

The weekly 30-minute session is supposed to be a test of Mr Cameron’s wits, with MPs able to ask him about almost any topic.

But a leaked series of memos reveal that his aides routinely try to take the pressure off him by encouraging Conservative MPs to ask friendly questions.

The PM pronounces during Prime Minister's 
Questions: Leaked emails allege that David Cameron's aides have been trying to stage manage the weekly session by pressurising Tory 
colleagues into asking easy questions

The memos show that Mr Cameron’s 
parliamentary aide sends out a weekly email to all Tory MPs suggesting 
‘free hits’ for them to read out during PMQs.

Gavin Williamson says that any mentions of the suggested questions would be greatly appreciated by Number 10.

The most recent email, which was sent out last week, said: ‘Please find below some questions, should you want to take the opportunity of a free hit today.

‘Good news on the economy features heavily – any mentions would be greatly appreciated.’

Other questions include whether Mr Cameron agrees that a ‘growing economy means more economic security for our country and a more financially secure future for hardworking people’.

Mr Williamson also suggests asking the Prime Minister whether he agrees that the Government’s economic plans were ‘delivering a sustainable recovery’.

‘Please find below some questions, should you want to take the opportunity of a free hit today.

'Good news on the economy features heavily - any mentions would be greatly appreciated.’

Similar emails from the past two months suggest Mr Williamson’s pleas have gone largely unrewarded – perhaps indicating the strained relationship between Tory high command and many backbench MPs.

But a question asked on December 11 by Tory MP Stephen Metcalfe bears a striking resemblance to one sent out by Mr Williamson an hour earlier.

Mr Williamson’s suggestions included 
the question: ‘Does the Prime Minister agree with me that the only way 
to raise my constituents’ living standards is to stick to the 
Government’s long-term plan to fix our economy, rather than abandoning 
the plan through more borrowing and more taxes as the party opposite 
propose?’

Mr Metcalfe went 
on to ask the Prime Minister: ‘Does my right honourable friend agree 
that the best way to raise the living standards of my constituents is 
for the Government to stick to their long-term plan to rebuild this 
economy and not abandon it in favour of more borrowing and more taxes, 
as proposed by the Labour party?’

Mr
 Cameron responded by saying Mr Metcalfe was ‘entirely right’, going on 
to explain the importance of reducing the deficit and continuing with 
the Government’s ‘difficult spending decisions’.

Sir Alistair Graham, the former chairman of the Committee on Standards in Public Life, described Mr Williamson’s emails as ‘depressing’.

He said: ‘If it continues like that it just helps people’s disengagement from politics because they don’t think it’s a serious engagement, it’s a manufactured bear garden.’

Party whips have long pressured MPs on all sides to ask friendly questions. Commons Speaker John Bercow has warned that soundbites and planted questions have helped damage the reputation of Parliament.
