A rare and ancient trove of coins and jewellery has been found buried near Temple Mount in Jerusalem dating back to the 7th Century.

The haul includes a total of 36 gold 
coins etched with images of Byzantine emperors and a 10cm medallion etched with a Menorah, Shofar made from a ram's horn, and a Torah scroll. 

Among the unprecedented find, made by Dr Eilat Mazar of Jerusalem's Hebrew University, was also a 3,000-year-old earthenware jug inscribed with what is believed to be the earliest example of written text ever discovered in the region.

A 10cm medallion etched with a Menorah, Shofar made from a ram's horn and a Torah scroll, (pictured) was found at the same site as the earthenware jug inscribed with the wine label. However, the medallion dates from the 7th Century, unlike the older wine container

A total of 36 gold coins etched with images of Byzantine emperors, pictured, were also found in the Ophel region between the City of David and Temple Mount. Many of the coins featured emperors ranging across a 250-year period including Constantine II to Mauricius

Dr Mazar told the Times of Israel: 'I have never found so much gold in my 
life! I was frozen. It was unexpected.'

The discovery was made in the ruins of a Byzantine public structure located in the Ophel region - between the city of David and around 50 metres from the southern wall of the First Temple.

Temple Mount is considered one of the most religious sites in Jerusalem and is where two biblical Jewish temples once stood.

It is also a site of Muslim interest site known as the Haram as-Sharif, or Noble Sanctuary.

This area is thought to be part of an ancient city wall in Jerusalem dating back to the 10th century BC, possibly built by King Solomon.

The trove was found in a section of this wall that is 70 yards long and six yards high.

Ophel is an area of Jerusalem between the City of David and the southern wall of the First Temple.

Dr Eilat Mazar uncovered part of an ancient city wall around 50 metres from the temple, and dating back to the 10th century BC in 2010.

The section is 70 yards long and six yards high.

Uncovered in the city wall complex was an inner gatehouse for access into the royal quarter of the city, a royal structure adjacent to the gatehouse, and a corner tower that overlooks a substantial section of the adjacent Kidron valley.

Mazar uncovered the section in 2010.

She found an inner gatehouse for access into the royal quarter of the city, a royal structure adjacent to the gatehouse, and a corner tower that overlooks a substantial section of the adjacent Kidron valley.

Many of the coins found featured emperors ranging across a 250-year including Constantine II to Mauricius.

As well as the Byzantine gold, pottery discovered at the site is believed to date back to the 10th Century, around the time of King David.

There were six ceramic jugs found in total and one had an ancient inscription engraved onto the side believed to be the earliest written text ever found in Jerusalem - predating the existing earliest engraving by around 250 years.

The inscription is written in an ancient language called Canaanite - originally spoken by a group of Biblical people before they were conquered by the Israelites in 1000BC.

The language was later revived among certain groups living in the region.

It consists of a letters that appear to translate to m, q, p, h, and n.

Although the meaning and full translation has not been carried out yet, Mazar believes the inscription could be the name of the jar's owner.

Mazar told the Times of Israel she believed the artefacts formed part of a 'communal treasure meant to help the sparse Jewish community survive hard times or rebuild what the Jews hoped would be a free community under Persian rule.'
