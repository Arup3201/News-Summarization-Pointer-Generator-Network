An Australian man wearing nothing but a sun hat risked his life to win a bet by paddling across a crocodile-infested river on a log.

Egged on by his friends, the man stripped off, grabbed a stick to use as an oar and paddled across the Northern Territory's dangerous Daly River.

Despite being watched by the river's scaly razor-toothed inhabitants, the naked daredevil finally clambered back on board a boat with all limbs attached - and claimed his prize of two cases of bourbon.

The Darwin man, who works as a tiler, remained on the log for about three minutes after taking on the bet, fuelled by alcohol.

'I'd enjoyed a few beers and it seemed a good idea at the time,' the man, who did not want to be identified, said.

'We weren't catching any fish because the river was flowing too fast, so I thought: "Why not?"' he told the Northern Territory News.

'But when I woke up the next morning, it didn't seem so clever.'   

Onlooker Billy Innes said his friend thought nothing of the dangers of drowning or being attacked and eaten by one of the river's cunning saltwater crocodiles, who disguise themselves as logs as they move in on their prey.

'It was hilarious,' said Mr Innes.

'We were camping beside the river when my mate accepted the bet.

'Huge trees were hammering down the river. It was quite a sight. Someone dared him to get on to one of the logs and row across the river.

'We went out in a boat and he jumped overboard onto a tree.

'He managed to stay on for quite a while before getting back into the boat.

'He got two cases of Jack Daniels for it - and thought that made it all worth while.'

Four years ago 20-year-old Keith Parry was killed by a crocodile when he tried to swim across the Daly River - one of the Northern Territory's most notorious crocodile-infested waterways - to collect more beer.

One local writing to the Northern Territory News said of the 'log rider': 'Typical boozo - what an utter idiot. So your life is worth a few drinks????'
