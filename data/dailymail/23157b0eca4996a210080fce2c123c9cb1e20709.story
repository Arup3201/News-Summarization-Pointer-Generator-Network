Kabir Ahmed spoke of how life under ISIS was 'fun' in an interview aired on BBC Radio 1's Newsbeat 

Radio 1 has fallen under scrutiny for airing an interview with an ISIS suicide bomber who boasted that fighting jihad in the Middle East was more fun than video games. 

The station broadcast an interview with Kabir Ahmed on June 13, three days before the organisation became a proscribed terrorist group in the UK. 

Ahmed, who used the name Abu Sumayyah in Syria, is thought to have killed himself and 11 police officers after detonating a bomb in Baaji, northern Iraq, on Friday. 

In the interview, the jihadi tells journalists he walked around carrying a Kalashnikob automatic weapon and a rocket propelled grenade launcher. 

'It's actually quite fun, better than, how you would say what's that game called, Call of Duty? It's like that, but you know, 3d, you know. 

'You can see everything's happening in front of you, you know, it's real, you know what I mean?' he said, adding he enjoyed 'freedom' and 'the good life'.  

Broadcasting regulator Ofcom and the BBC Trust have ruled that the interview, believed to have been recorded near Ahmed's training camp in northern Syria, fell foul of regulations as his positive descriptions of ISIS were unchallenged.

A spokesman for the watchdog said: 'Ofcom’s rules require broadcasters to protect audiences, and in particular children, from harmful and offensive content.

'After a thorough investigation, Ofcom found the BBC breached rules by failing to challenge the positive descriptions an Isis fighter provided of his experiences in an interview.' 

The BBC Trust said its failure to challenge views that were aired and to include sufficient context amounted to a breach of impartiality rules. 

'Newsbeat accepts the findings of the Ofcom report - appropriate measures have already been introduced to prevent similar breaches in the future,' a spokesman said. 

Ahmed, pictured with Iraqi children, fled the UK after being released from prison. The 30-year-old spent time in Syria before travelling to Iraq where he is thought to have killed himself 

Ahmed is thought to have killed himself and 11 policemen by driving a truckload of explosives into a group of Shi'ite Muslims. 

His family this weekend spoke of their horror, adding they felt he should not have been allowed through airport security to travel to Syria as he was allegedly known to authorities. 

‘He just left us and everybody knows we don’t have contact with him and we haven’t tried to contact him,’ a woman at his house said of the jihadi. 

Former care worker and father-of-three Kabir Ahmed, 30, said he was prepared to sacrifice his own children 'a hundred times for Allah' in his last known interview before driving an explosives-laden truck into an Iraqi police convoy.

The fundamentalist, who was jailed in 2012 after handing out homophobic propaganda calling for gay people to face the death penalty in Britain, had fled his family home and country to join jihadis in Syria. 

After serving his sentence, Ahmed abandoned his wife Nashira Arif, 28, and their three children 16 months ago to join Islamic group Jund al-Sham in Syria before switching his allegiance to IS.

It was also well known before he left the country that Ahmed had links to Anjem Choudary and the banned British terrorist organisation al-Muhajiroun.

In one interview available online, the jihadi said he was ‘craving martyrdom’.

He is thought to have killed himself and 11 policeman in Beiji, a city north of Baghdad, on Friday.
