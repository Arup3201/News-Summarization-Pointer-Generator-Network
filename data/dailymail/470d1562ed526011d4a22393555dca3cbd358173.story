A Jealous Russian soldier who kicked his ex-girlfriend in the head after shooting her new lover was arrested after his grandmother turned up - and told him to go home.

Dementi Fomin had been drinking with his girlfriend Marianne Sokolova in Kazan, in south-western Russia's Republic of Tatarstan, when Iskander Maslov walked in and launched his attack. 

CCTV footage shows the couple hugging before 30-year-old Maslov appears in the doorway and pulls out a pistol.

Barmaid Snjezana Blinova, 45, said: 'I have worked here for a long time and have seen stabbings, knife fights, all kinds of things.

'When people get drunk they get dangerous. But I have never seen anything like this.

'The man's grandmother told him off and said he should know better and then told him to go home, which he did.'

After police arrived they took unconscious Fomin and his bleeding girlfriend to hospital where they are now both recovering.

A police spokesman said: 'The three people are all locals and were all drunk.

'It seems the former soldier had previously been in a relationship with the woman and was upset about her having found someone new. 

'Fortunately his grandmother was on hand to stop the situation escalating.'

The man is now facing trial for carrying an illegal firearm, attempted murder and assault.
