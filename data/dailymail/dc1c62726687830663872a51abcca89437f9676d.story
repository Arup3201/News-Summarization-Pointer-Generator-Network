Mustafa Bazbaz, 28, has been convicted of picking up a 15-year-old Ohio girl and taking her to a hotel in West Virginia, where they had sex

A 
commercial airline pilot living in Pennsylvania has been convicted of 
traveling across state lines to have sex with a 15-year-old girl, 
federal prosecutors say.

Republic
 Airways pilot Mustafa M. Bazbaz, 28, faces 30 years in federal prison 
and $250,000 in fines after he picked up the young girl in Ohio, took 
her to a hotel in West Virginia some 25 miles away and had intercourse 
with her.

Having sex with minors is usually a crime dealt with at the local level, but Bazbaz was charged in federal court because he took the girl across state lines.

Federal prosecutors say that Bazbaz and a 15-year-old Ohio girl began talking in December 2013 via the social networking site 
MeetMe.

He told the girl he was a 17-year-old boy named 'Mike B.'

'Age is just a number,' he told her.

The conversations quickly turned sexual. They exchanged nude pictures and talked in detail about what acts they would perform on each other, court records show.

Then the day after, Bazbas drove by her home in Irondale, Ohio, and took her to a Holiday Inn Express in Newell, West Virginia.

There he rented a room and the two had sex. He drove the girl back a few hours later.

The girl's mother became suspicious when her daughter came home reeking of cologne and confronted her about it.

When questioned by police, Bazbaz at first claimed he didn't know the girl's age at the time.

Authorities busted him after discovering he saved the girl's number on his cell phone as 'Ohio 15,' clearly showing he knew how young she was.

He pleaded guilty to the charges on Tuesday.

Republic Airways did not immediately reply to a call seeking comment on Thursday.

He posed as a teenager named 'Mike B' to pick up the teenager on meetme.com

Bazbaz was a pilot with Republic Airways at the time of his arrest
