Supermarket giant Tesco has doubled the price of some items in its budget food range, just as shoppers turn to no-frills basics to save money after splurging over Christmas.

The price of a tin of Everyday Value mushy peas went up to 25p in December - more than triple its previous 8p price tag - while other staples such as dried spaghetti and frozen chicken breasts have also gone up.

The price hikes were highlighted as Tesco reported its biggest sales boost over the Christmas period in three years.

Price rises: Tesco has bumped up the prices of many products in its budget Everyday Value range

Shoppers hoping to snap up bargains from Tesco's own brand range will find themselves paying more for a host of items, with low-fat cottage cheese up from 59p to 75p, Rich Tea biscuits up from 23p to 35p, and a pack of dried mixed fruit up from 64p to 98p.

Everyday Value sausages, previously priced at £1, are now £1.50, while the price of tomato ketchup has almost doubled from 16p to 30p.

James Foord, from mysupermarket.com, said: 'Prices change constantly, which is why we show the price history of every product on our site to allow customers to decide if they are getting a good price on a product.

'Recently we introduced Savvy Buys, which are products that are currently at least 30 per cent below the average price across the retailers, so customers can see instantly if they are getting a good deal.'

Campaigner Sarah Willingham, from 
LetsSaveSomeMoney.com, told Mail Online: 'Supermarkets can be very 
clever. Tesco owns nearly 30 per cent of the market and they know that a
 penny rise here and a penny rise there makes a huge difference to their
 bottom line, but consumers might not notice it.

'The Everyday Value range has been a 
great thing for them - and I will say, for the consumer as well - but 
more people are in food poverty now than ever.

'Times are tough and now is not the time to penalise people who can't afford it.

'My message to consumers would be: shop around and don't be misled by loyalty - you won't be rewarded for it.'

Hike: The rises have seen the price of a tin of mushy peas go up from 8p to 25p

No-frills: Tesco's own-brand tomato ketchup has also gone up in price, from 16p to 30p

The retailer has said it was forced to introduce the hikes as a result of rising commodity costs and food inflation, but insisted its Everyday Value range was still priced extremely competitively when compared to similar ranges at rival supermarkets.

But the fact that the retailer put up most of the prices over November and December has led to suggestions Tesco did so to cash in on last-minute shoppers in the run up to Christmas, as well as those turning to own brand items in a bid to save money at the start of the new year.

Guy Anker, from moneysavingexpert.com, said: 'Those who are most hard-up are likely to choose this range of goods, so any price rise to the value range is very disappointing.'

Mr Anker urged consumers to 'do their research' before doing their grocery shopping, to ensure they were getting the best possible price.

A Tesco spokeswoman said: 'At Tesco we're committed to offering our customers great quality products at great prices through our Everyday Value range, and in these difficult times for our customers we are working hard to keep the cost of food shopping down.

'While factors such as rising commodity costs and food inflation mean that some products have increased in price slightly over the past year, most of our Everyday Value products have stayed at the same low prices or are now even cheaper,' the spokeswoman added.

Today Tesco revealed its best UK sales figures for three years as it posted a 1.8 per cent rise in like-for-like sales for the six weeks up to January 5.

The figure, which does not include petrol sales, came in the wake of the group's first fall in profits for 18 years, after Tesco recorded an 11.6 per cent drop to £1.66billion for the six months to September last year.
