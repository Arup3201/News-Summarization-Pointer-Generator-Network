A bus driver has been sacked after 17 years behind the wheel because he wanted to be at the birth of his first son.

Shaun Hooley, 38, from Barnsley, South Yorkshire, had already been at work for four hours when he got a call to say his partner Rebecca Asquith had gone in labour.

He immediately called his employers at Tates Travel and asked for a cover driver to be organised so he could finish work early to get to the Barnsley Hospital.

Shaun Hooley was sacked from his job as a bus driver for Tates Travel because he left work to see the birth of his first son, Jacob

Shaun, who had been a bus driver since the age of 21 and had worked for Tates Travel for 10 weeks, drove his bus back to the depot and was told he was sacked.

‘Obviously I wanted to be there for the birth of my first son, what father wouldn't want that?

‘I made several phone calls to the office trying to come up with a solution to the problem. I didn't say I had to leave straight away. I didn't stop the bus and just rush off.

‘I did what I thought was the responsible thing. I called the office and asked if they could arrange for a cover driver to take over my route. I said I would call back later to see what arrangements had been made and in the meantime I carried on driving the bus.

‘I made more calls but I was getting nowhere so I drove my bus back to the depot. I waited until I had dropped off all my passengers and the bus was empty before I went back.

Graham Mallinson of Tates Travel said cover was arranged for Shaun Hooley but he left work in breach of his contract

He added: ‘I have been in touch with
ACAS but I was told it had always been a gentleman's agreement that a 
man could always leave to go see the birth of their child

‘Because of that no law has ever been implemented.'

‘I was told by the boss of the company I had sacked myself because of my action. I was just looking for a little understanding, it was an emergency and I wanted to be with Rebecca.

‘I have been hard working and never let them down. I thought they would be compassionate.

‘I'm angry and upset, you would assume that every employer these days would recognise that fathers want to be there for the birth of their children.

Shaun Hooley left work to see the birth of his first son, Jacob Thomas, at Barnsley General Hospital

‘I've lost my job but I did get to the hospital in time and I was there for the birth of my son Jacob Thomas.’

Graham Mallinson, managing director of Tates Travel said: ‘He was 14 miles from the depot when he phoned to say he wanted time off to attend his baby's birth.

‘That was about four hours after he started his shift. We told him we would try to get a relief driver and at 9.40 we had organised one.

‘We phoned him but he didn't reply. He came back to the depot a little after 10am with an empty bus and he was told he was in breach of his contract and he was dismissed.

‘He was on a three month trial and if he had given us reasonable notice that his partner was expecting a baby and he wanted to be at the birth he could have taken time off.’
