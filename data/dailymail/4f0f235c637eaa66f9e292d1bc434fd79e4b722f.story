In Monday’s Sportsmail, Ed Hawkins revealed two approaches made by a former Test star to Brendon McCullum in 2008 to fix matches – one before the inaugural IPL, and one during New Zealand’s tour of England.

McCullum turned them down, and later provided testimony to the ICC’s Anti-Corruption and Security Unit – testimony which Hawkins got hold of.

The immediate reaction of New Zealand Cricket was to point out that McCullum was not being investigated (Hawkins never said he was) and to express ‘dismay’ that his testimony had been leaked.

Pointing out an approach: Brendon McCullum gave a testimony to the ICC after being asked to fix matches

In a perfect world, NZC would have a 
point. It’s a world in which every player who has been asked to do 
something illegal reports the approach to the authorities, immediately. 
It’s a world in which those authorities can be trusted to bring the 
guilty to account. And it’s a world in which no-one within cricket’s 
internecine corridors of power has an axe to grind.

It’s also a world that doesn’t exist. And it’s why some journalists will continue to treat these stories like forbidden fruit.

Leaks happen for a reason. Those who run the game should spend less time outraging about the morality of leakage, and more time fretting about the fact that others feel the need to leak in the first place.

The story of cricket’s so-called fight against corruption has been an underwhelming one, in which the main blows have been struck by the Indian police or the media. The ACSU have precious little to shout about: Kenya’s Maurice Odumbe, Marlon Samuels of West Indies, and – thanks to the work of its English branch – Mervyn Westfield and Danish Kaneria of Essex.

Yet to judge not only by vast swathes of anecdotal evidence over the years, but also by the recent revelations about the number of people being monitored by the ACSU, you wonder what else we don’t know about.

It’s true that the ACSU’s legal powers are limited. But it’s equally true that they are yet to convince the cricket community that they have the manpower, the expertise or even the will to deal with the problem.

The game’s attempts to handle corruption took a bizarre twist recently when it was claimed that the ACSU would be reformed, reporting no longer to the ICC’s chief executive Dave Richardson, but to the ICC’s new chairman.

As things stand, this chairman will be N Srinivasan, who has been temporarily incapacitated as president of the BCCI by India’s Supreme Court because of an investigation into – that’s right – corruption at the Indian Premier League.

This, then, is the man who may soon be heading up cricket’s battle against corruption.

So you’ll forgive the media – and the public – if their faith in cricket’s capacity to police itself is on the shaky side of sceptical. It’s in these circumstances that leaks occur. And, in the long run, these leaks will help paint a clearer picture, which is the least the public deserve.

Throwing matches: Lou Vincent has admitted being involved in plans to fix games

But the public deserve more than that. They deserve to know that the game they’re paying to watch contains players who actually care about its legitimacy.

I’m not talking here about the match-fixers themselves; they’re beyond the point of caring. No, it’s a question of persuading those who have been approached by the Lou Vincents of the game that they owe cricket a duty of care by exposing them straightaway.

For that reason, we can’t heap all the blame on the administrators, who are hamstrung by a variety of factors ranging from legal impotence to downright incompetence. It is the players who must take ownership.

Last week I met Mal Loye, who spoke at length about Vincent’s attempts to corrupt him before a Twenty20 game for Lancashire in 2008. Loye is one of cricket’s good guys, who found himself suddenly thrown in at the deep end and gasping for breath.

One of the ggod guys: Mal Loye was appraoached by Vincent when they were team-mates at Lancashire

Six years ago, it had not been drummed into players that non-disclosure of an illegal approach was in itself an offence. Loye regrets keeping the approach to himself, and hopes others won’t make the mistake he made.

Neither would they have any excuse for doing so: where the ACSU can claim some credit is in educating players about the modus operandi of the bookies. In 2014, everyone knows the score.

In the meantime, the administrators might be advised to focus on ridding the game of corruption, not bemoaning the work of journalists who have lost faith in their capacity to do so.

It’s fashionable right now to bash everything the ECB do, and in some instances they deserve it. But it was interesting to note the selection of Michael Carberry in England’s one-day squad for the five-match series starting on Thursday against Sri Lanka.

Carberry was dropped from the 50-over side after averaging 21, with a strike-rate of 62, during five ODIs last September. In March, he told the Guardian that ‘I seem to have been left out for some unknown reason. I don’t think it’s a cricket reason because my one-day stats speak for themselves over the last few seasons’.

Asked whether he had heard from the selectors since returning from the Ashes in Australia, he replied: ‘No. Nothing – which is disappointing. But it’s the way they tend to do things.’

Now he’s been picked again. Maybe he feels he owes England a better return than he managed first time round.

The ability of teams in the IPL to chase down almost any total has done little to quell the fears of those who believe boundaries have been brought too far in-field. To quote one concerned party: ‘As we looked down on the ground for the press box, the playing area seemed very small. It would be interesting to know when this habit of making off much of the ground with a circle first was accepted […] It seems wrong to me…’

Those words were written by Jack Fingleton, in his 1949 book Brightly Fades the Don. He was talking about the Lord’s Ashes Test of the previous summer. We like to imagine that cricketing gripes are new – and all the more outrageous for being so. In fact, the same grumbles have been around for years. It’s just that no one ever does anything about them.

Mushtaq Ahmed, until recently the ECB’s spin-bowling coach, has taken up a similar role with the Pakistan team, and immediately told www.PakPassion.net that his aim was to ‘find and develop mystery spinners’.

We wish him luck – and wonder why English cricket didn’t seem such fertile ground for him to do the same thing during his five-and-a-bit years in this country.

With Matt Prior fighting off an achilles injury and the first Test against Sri Lanka at Lord’s fast approaching, the gloves are off for the fight to, er, put the gloves back on. The field is wide open, and Steve Davies looked in good nick while helping to shepherd Surrey to their first Championship win of the season against Gloucestershire at The Oval last week.

So it’s a shame that Davies has asked to be relieved of his wicket-keeping duties while he rediscovers his form with the bat. There may never be a better chance to grab those Test gloves.
