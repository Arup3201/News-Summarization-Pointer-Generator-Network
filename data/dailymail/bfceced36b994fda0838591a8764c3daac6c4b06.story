London's relegation from the Super League was confirmed at the Halliwell Jones stadium as the winless Broncos suffered their 20th straight defeat of the season at the hands of the in-form Warrington Wolves.

Salford's victory over Hull this weekend coupled with this heavy defeat for the Broncos sees London's run in the top flight come to an end and the game's flagship competition without a presence in the capital in 2015.

The rampant Wolves made it 10 wins in succession as they had far too much power and pace for Super League's basement dwellers, running in 13 tries.

Relegated: London Broncos were sent down from the Super League after a 72-12 defeat at in-form Warrington, their 20th straight loss of the season

Winger Joel Monaghan claimed four tries with second row forward Ben Currie and prop Chris Hill both scoring hat-tricks, with the other tries coming from Ben Harrison, Paul Wood and Gene Ormsby while Chris Bridge landed 10 goals.

London's points came from tries by Joe Keyes and Scott Moore, with Josh Drinkwater kicking both conversions.

Warrington gave a debut to teenager Toby King in the centre while Paul Wood made his comeback from a torn bicep injury on the substitutes' bench.

London knocked on straight from the kick-off and that set the tone for the opening exchanges as winger Gene Ormsby and prop Chris Hill were denied tries by some last gasp Broncos defence in the opening minutes.

But it did not take long for the Wolves to open their account when in the seventh minute some crisp handling finished with Bridge sending Monaghan over for the opening try.

And the Australian winger was on the mark again five minutes later when he took Ben Westwood's pass to score and give the Wolves an early 8-0 advantage.

But on their first foray into Warrington territory the Broncos posted points as they kept the ball alive superbly and stand-off Keyes crossed for the try which Drinkwater converted.

A scuffle between Bridge and Atelea Vea sparked a punch up which raised the temperature a little but the Wolves soon got back to business with four tries in a blistering nine-minute spell.

Firstly Monaghan's kick on the last tackle bounced nicely for Hill to scoop up the loose ball and touch down and fine inter-passing between Ben Currie and Rhys Evans ended with Currie touching down four minutes later.

Straight from the restart a superb break by Gareth O'Brien allowed the supporting Currie to claim a quick-fire double and then Monaghan completed his hat-trick when he benefited from quick hands from Higham and Bridge straight from a scrum.

Bridge kicked four first-half goals to give the Wolves a commanding 32-6 half time lead.

It took the Wolves just five minutes after the restart to add to their tally as Currie claimed his hat trick as he touched down Matty Russell's kick and Bridge converted.

London claimed their second try of the game on 51 minutes when Moore crashed over from close range and Drinkwater's conversion went over off the upright.

But normal service was soon resumed as Wood on his return to action took O'Brien's pass to score and stretch their lead to 42-12.

In the final 20 minutes the Wolves added a further five tries as the Broncos tired with Monaghan scoring his fourth, Hill claiming two more to complete his hat trick and Gene Ormsby and Ben Harrison also touching down.
