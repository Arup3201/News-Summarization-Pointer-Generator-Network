David Cameron sparked an ageism row today after referring to a veteran Labour MP as 'a dinosaur'.

Left-wing Dennis Skinner, dubbed 'the Beast of Bolsover' because of the Derbyshire constituency he represents, asked the final question during Mr Cameron's weekly 30-minute Commons grilling at Prime Minister's Questions.

Mr Skinner, who turns 80 next month, asked Mr Cameron when he would appear before Lord Justice Leveson's inquiry into press standards.

The PM said he would be 'delighted' to appear at the Royal Courts of Justice when required, then added: 'It's good to see the honourable gentleman on such good form.

'I often say to my children ''No need to go to the Natural History Museum to see a dinosaur, come to the House of Commons at about 12.30pm''.'

Bolshy Mr Skinner (right) has been known as the Beast of Bolsover for decades for his outspoken comments and habit of infuriating successive Labour leaders.

The 79-year-old loose cannon claims to come from 'good working-class mining stock' and has been hot water many a time for his unruly outbursts.

A fiercely left-wing, old school Labourite, Mr Skinner has been thrown out of the Commons at least nine times - including being ejected in 1992 for calling then agriculture minister John Gummer a 'little squirt' and a 'wart'.

In 1981 he was even 'named' - the next stage up in the Speakers' disciplinary weaponry - and banned from the chamber for five days.

When complaining in 2005 about the state of the 1980s economy under Tory governments, Mr Skinner said of George Osborne, then shadow chancellor: 'The only thing that was growing then were the lines of coke in front of boy George and the rest of the Tories.'

The barb later sparked a point of order from Labour MP Paul Flynn (Newport West), who asked if it was appropriate for MPs to be criticised on the basis of their age.

Raising his point of order, Mr Flynn said: 'One of the areas of Parliamentary life that has improved in recent years is it is now completely unacceptable for one Member to criticise another Member on the basis of gender, on the basis of race, ethnicity or disability.

'The most under-represented group in this Parliament are the septuagenarians. Today we heard what I believe many of us (believed) was a gratuitous and entirely offensive insult to a greatly respected honourable Member made entirely because of his age.

'Is it right that ageist discriminatory remarks should be outlawed the same as the other discriminatory remarks are?'

Labour MP Brian Donohoe (Central Ayrshire) added: 'Is it not also the case Erskine May makes it very clear that no Member of Parliament should criticise another one and call them a name that relates to an animal? In these circumstances is it not only right that the Prime Minister should come back to this place and apologise to Dennis Skinner?'

And Labour's David Winnick (Walsall North) then raised a further point of order: 'Those of us of a certain age group should not be seen as the new persecuted minority.'

But on the same point of order, Tory Mark Pritchard (The Wrekin) said: 'I wonder whether this House of Commons would be better with more or less humour?'

Replying to the four points of order, Speaker John Bercow said: 'I'm always in favour of humour but just as beauty is in the eye of the beholder, humour is a matter of subjective judgment.

'Sometimes people are funny. Sometimes they think they are funny. Sometimes they think they are funny deliberately when they are not. Sometimes they don't realise they are funny when they are.

'There are all sorts of different permutations. I think it would be unwise for me to offer a view as to the category of which the matter of current discussion happens to fall.

'Coming back to the point of Mr Winnick, I agree septuagenarians should not become a persecuted minority. You are sometimes in a principled minority on a range of matters and has been throughout your parliamentary career. All I would say is I don't think you are persecuted, certainly not by me, and I think anyone trying to persecute you should frankly give up the unequal struggle.

'As to the point of order from Mr Donohoe, I think I am right in saying that Erskine May no longer contains the prohibition to which you refer. At one time or another there has been a prohibition on or presumption against reference to an existing animal.'

'As far as Mr Flynn is concerned, I think I would say it is very difficult for me to interpret the mindset of another Member, be that a newly arrived Member, or a very senior Member or the most senior Member of the Government.

'Sometimes I think an observation might be made with reference to a past attitude, style or conduct and I don't think I want to get into the issue of what was said today - though I might want to reflect on it.

'All I would say is I share your absolute disapproval of sexism, ageism, racism and other forms of discrimination.'
