Six British Army rugby players have been accused of beating up an off-duty New York policeman during a 4am bar brawl.

A court in Manhattan heard that the soldiers from the 1st Battalion of the Royal Regiment of Scotland allegedly punched the officer to the floor then carried on hitting him as his friend tried to stop them.

As the brawl carried on down the street, it left blood splattered along half a block until the officer pulled out a knife and slashed one of his attackers.

The men, who are all from Fiji but are
 based in Edinburgh, are part of an Army rugby team on a tour of the US 
East Coast.

They claimed that they lashed out when the policeman called 
one of them a ‘black b******’.

Assault charge: 34-year-old Private Felite Vunisarat is one of the soldiers who allegedly attacker the off-duty officer

The
 court was told that when he identified himself as a policeman and 
ordered them to back off during the confrontation last Friday, they 
responded: ‘We don’t care. F*** the police.’

The
 soldiers – Private Iliakini Raderua, 30, Corporal Thomas Shute, 34, 
Private Felite Vunisarati, 34, Private Mosese Kuruala, 27, and Private 
Joeli Raduva, 34 – are accused of third degree assault.

Lance
 Corporal Iosefo Yavala,  33, is also accused of second degree robbery, a
 more serious offence, after he was allegedly found carrying the 
officer’s mobile phone which was taken during the brawl.

The soldiers, 
whose regimental motto is No One Provokes Me With Impunity, were due to 
play against a team from the New York Police Department on Wednesday, 
but they are now being held in the notorious Rikers Island prison after 
failing to post bail of $25,000 (just over £16,000)

In court they stood next to each other dressed in white T-shirts and shorts or trousers.

Prosecutor
 Emily Logue said that the row began at the Mercury Bar in Manhattan 
when Yavala ‘bumped into the victim and began yelling at him’. 

The
 group then allegedly ‘surrounded’ the officer and Kuruala ‘punched him
 in the face, causing him to fall down’ and the others rained down blows
 as his friend tried to help him up.

When
 the rookie policeman then tried to call the emergency number 911 on his
 mobile phone, one of the group punched him in the head and Yavala 
allegedly took the phone.

The officer then pulled out a knife and Yavala
 was cut.

Robert Fisher, defending Kuruala, said that the policeman ‘escalated’ the situation.

Seema
 Iyer, defending five of the soldiers, asked that they be released as 
they are ‘upstanding members of the armed services in their country’ 
with no criminal records.

It
 was revealed that Yavala has been in the Army for 11 years, Shute is a 
12-year veteran and Raduva has served 13 years and is a decorated war 
hero who was Mentioned in Dispatches in 2011.

All six men will appear before the court again next week.

The captain of the rugby team, Captain Matt Stevens, said after the hearing that the rest of their tour was continuing.

A
 Ministry of Defence spokesman said: ‘All those who are found to fall 
short of the Army’s high standards will face disciplinary action, up to 
and including discharge.’
