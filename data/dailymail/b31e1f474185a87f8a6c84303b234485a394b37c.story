Former 100metres world record-holder Asafa Powell returned to the track in Lucerne, Switzerland on Tuesday after his 18-month ban for taking a banned stimulant was reduced to six months on appeal.

The Jamaican claimed he felt 'like a virgin' before his year away from the sport ended with him finishing third in 10.30secs. Sadly, however, the purity and thrill of watching a man run as fast as is humanly possible disappeared a long time ago.

The Commonwealth Games start in Glasgow a week on Wednesday and, although Powell's time will not force Jamaican selectors into making a difficult decision, the 31-year-old could still feasibly have been picked to represent his country once again.

Powell missed the national championships with 'stomach flu' and the Jamaican team has already been named, but changes can be made on medical grounds up until July 25.

His inclusion, however, would have been a further slight on those who have paid up to £90 to sit inside Hampden Park and trust what they are seeing is the result of real human endeavour and natural talent. Increasingly, it is only the clever work of highly-paid lawyers, hired to take their client's cases to the Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS) and get them back on track as soon as possible.

Already this year, Jamaican 400m runner Dominique Blake has successfully appealed for her six-year ban for taking a banned stimulant to be cut by 18 months. Three-time Olympic champion Veronica Campbell-Brown, who will compete in Glasgow, also saw a two-year suspension dismissed as CAS berated the 'deplorable' mistakes in collecting her positive sample.

Powell and fellow Jamaican sprinter Sherone Simpson employed American attorney Paul Greene to fight their 18-month bans, arguing three months was more appropriate for their 'minor' offences because the banned substance, oxilofrine, had been found in a contaminated food supplement, Epiphany D1.

Their appeal was partially upheld and the Jamaican Anti-Doping Commission (JADCO) has been forced to pay 'historic costs' in lawyer and appeal costs, believed to be 'one of the biggest rewards in the history of CAS.' Sport's highest authority will reveal the full reasons for its findings in due course.

In Australia, meanwhile, an amateur surfboat rower, Brendan Ellis, who paid £20 for an over-the-counter supplement at a health food store, is saddled with a two-year ban for testing positive for the same stimulant, oxilofrine. An Australian Football League (AFL) midfielder, Ahmed Saad, is serving an 18-month suspension for a banned stimulant he inadvertently took in a sports drink on match day.

UK Anti-Doping operates a 'no excuses' policy and has forced all home nation athletes competing at the Commonwealth Games, as well as more than 200 coaches, to complete a mandatory education programme. Its goal is to avoid a single positive test during Glasgow 2014, but there is no uniformity across the globe or in different sports, and it is ultimately the clean athletes and the fans expected to fill stadiums who suffer.

The IAAF, athletics' world governing body, is committed 'to doing everything in its power to eradicate cheating' and will return to four-year bans for 'serious doping offences' from January 2015. The list of athletes currently serving drugs bans stretches to 26 pages and the IAAF has been testing blood, as well as urine, since 2001.

When athletes are banned for taking drugs, the default position is still to desperately cling on to the positives and talk about the strong message of zero tolerance those suspensions send out. But the messages at the moment are so mixed it's difficult to take any positives at all.

Yes, we're catching them, but then we're letting them back into the sport. Relatively little is still known about the long-term effects of doping on performance, while the short-term impact in terms of trust and reputation is acutely damaging.

Sprinting, in particular, has become a merry-go-round of former drug cheats. Half of the men who featured in the 100m final at the London 2012 Olympics are now tainted and 40 sub-10-second performances have had to be scratched from the archives.

And yet organisers of the Lucerne meeting still clamoured to sign Powell and blow most of their modest £500,000 budget on staging his comeback.

They then trumpeted his return at a press conference on Monday, during which he was sitting next to Valerie Adams: New Zealand's Olympic shot put champion who was denied her moment on top of the podium in London by a drugs cheat.

Nadzeya Ostapchuk of Belarus cried her 'crocodile tears' while a gold medal was placed around her neck, only to then twice test positive for methenolone, an anabolic steroid. She claimed her coach had intentionally spiked her coffee, but was given a four-year ban and stripped of the Olympic title.

'I was pissed off,' said Adams last year. 'I was really angry at her. I think one thing is that I will never forgive her. She has tainted the sport.'

Ostapchuk did, and so too do the hundreds of others who cheat, serve their time and then return to track and field crying their crocodile tears. We need to believe what we are seeing is real.
