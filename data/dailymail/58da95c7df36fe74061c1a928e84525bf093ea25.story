These babies rescued from human traffickers have been put up for adoption after being neglected by their parents. 

The 11 children, including six boys and five girls, were part of a group of 21 saved from traffickers by officials in Kaiyuan in south-western China's Yunnan Province. 

Only 10 of the group of 21 were re-united with their original parents. 

Now, four months later, local officials have decided to offer them to foster parents in the hope of giving them a normal life.

Child trafficking is a deep-rooted problem in China with critics blaming the one-child policy as creating a thriving underground market for buying children, and also women

The babies' families were allegedly paid up to 10,000 yuan (£1,033), and the infants were in turn sold for at least 10 times that sum, up to 140,000 yuan (£14,505)

Child trafficking has been a long-standing problem in China, which critics say is created by the country's sinister one-child policy. 

The strict laws limit many families to one child, and with boys being favoured as heirs to the family name, many female babies are sold, aborted or abandoned. 

Poverty fuels the trade, while illicit profits tempts traffickers, resulting in a thriving market for babies and toddlers. 

In this particular case, police arrested 32 people accused of involvement in the trafficking. 

They said their suspicions were first aroused in August last year when officers spotted a middle-aged couple with non-local accents preparing to board a train at Kunming, the largest city in the Yunnan Province, with an infant who appeared to be only a few weeks old.  

After questioning, the couple admitted to buying the baby from traffickers.

Police later uncovered a network buying babies from remote villages and transporting them to willing buyers.

The babies' families were allegedly paid up to 10,000 yuan (£1,033), and the infants were in turn sold for at least 10 times that sum, up to 140,000 yuan (£14,505).

It is unlikely the babies will struggle to find an adopted home given the huge demand for babies in the country. 

So far, 100 families have applied for a child - which is almost 10 couples for every baby.

There is an underground criminal network in China which deals in kidnapped or bought baby boys, as well as baby girls destined to be brides attracting rich dowries in sparsely populated regions

Despite the criticism levelled at it, China has said it has intensified the crackdown on kidnapping of children

Despite this, China has trumpeted the success of an intensified crackdown on the kidnapping and sale of children recently. 

In 2011, police said they had rescued more than 13,000 abducted children and 23,000 women over the past two years or so.

A year later, Chinese authorities made one of their biggest sweeps and broke up two major child trafficking gangs, arresting more than 800 suspects across the country and freeing 181 children.
