Italian police are seeking a ballerina they believe may shed light on the Costa Concordia disaster.

Domnica Cemortan was seen cavorting with Captain Francesco Schettino in the minutes before his cruise liner foundered on rocks.

Italian authorities believe 52-year-old Schettino – dubbed Captain Coward – may have been distracted from his command by trying to impress the dancer.

Schettino was seen 'drinking' at dinner in the company of Ms Cemortan at about 8.35pm on Friday evening. The picture of her on the right was taken on the bridge of the Concordia

Detained: Captain Francesco Schettino was spotted dining with the blonde woman just 30 minutes before the cruise liner hit rocks

They consider the 25-year-old Moldovan blonde to be a ‘key witness’.

Eleven people are dead and 30 missing after the £400million ship came to grief on a rocky outcrop off the Tuscan isle of Giglio.

It was carrying 4,200 passengers.

Miss Cemortan, who has a two-year-old daughter, had worked as a translator for the Concordia but was on holiday on the ship at the time of Friday night’s disaster.

A grainy photograph was taken of her on the bridge.

It is thought she might be able to shed light on Schettino’s decision to sail close to Giglio to perform a ‘salute’ for a former crew member and for the ship’s head waiter.

Miss Cemortan and Schettino were seen wining and dining together 30 minutes before the disaster.

One passenger, Angelo Fabri, said: ‘The captain was in a dark jacket and he was sat in front of the woman – she was quite young and at first I thought it might have been his daughter.

‘She was slim, had blonde hair to her shoulders and was wearing a black dress with her arms uncovered. They were laughing and in high spirits.’

He said the captain was drinking wine – a claim that contradicts Schettino’s assertion that he stayed off alcohol.

A source for operator Costa Cruises 
said: ‘The woman who appears to have dined with Schettino was a Costa 
employee who had been hired to assist Russian passengers.

Investigators are probing whether the fear of paying a £25million compensation bill was to blame for the hour delay in telling the Costa Concordia's 3,000 passengers to abandon ship.

Every one of the vessel's passengers is in line to receive £8,300 - or €10,000 - payout once an order is made to abandon ship.

With so many passengers on board the operators Costa Cruises would have faced a mammoth payout.

Officials probing the disaster are believed to be probing whether the fear of compensation was to blame for the delay, The Times reported.

11 passengers have been confirmed dead and 21 people are injured.

‘She was due to disembark from the Costa Concordia before it began its seven-day cruise of the Mediterranean but she bought a ticket and stayed onboard.

‘We cannot confirm or deny that she was on the bridge. To be honest, nobody quite knows what Schettino was up to.’

In an interview with Moldovan newspaper Adevarul, Miss Cemortan admitted being on the bridge on Friday evening and added that ‘he (Schettino) was there’.

Italian newspapers yesterday claimed 
Schettino has admitted being with Miss Cemortan at the time and that she
was not on the official passenger manifest.

Her mother Vera, who lives with her in the Moldovan capital Chisinau, said the seven-day cruise was a birthday present.

Yesterday Miss Cemortan defended 
Schettino: ‘I know that some of my colleagues should be upset because 
they are out of work now and they have debts and have kids waiting for 
them but we are all in agreement that the captain did something 
exceptional and saved 3,000 lives.’

Wearing protective gear, Ms Cermortan gets to grips with fire extinguishers during her safety course. She confirmed that she did have dinner with the captain, and that she went to the bridge at 11.50pm after the impact - but only to give instructions to Russian-speaking passengers

Initial reports suggested Ms Cemortan (left) may have been on board the ship without proper authorisation. Costa Cruises later confirmed she was an authorised passenger

Prosecutors believe Domnica Cemortan might have crucial evidence on what happened in the moments after the fatal 'sail by' which was apparently carried out by Schettino as a 'salute' to a former captain

Race against time: A technician aims a laser scanner at the cruise liner. There are fears impending bad weather could cause the ship to fall off the ledge on which it is resting

Damning transcripts of a phone call 
between Schettino and a coastguard have since emerged – revealing his 
refusal to return to the listing ship to help co-ordinate the rescue of 
hundreds of stranded passengers.

Schettino says he deserted the vessel only because he ‘tripped’ and fell into a lifeboat.

A transcript released yesterday shows
that – even 45 minutes after striking rocks – Schettino was  telling 
coastguards the only help he needed was a tug.

He is under house arrest on suspicion of multiple manslaughter, abandoning ship and causing shipwreck. If convicted, he faces 15 years in jail.

He is barred from leaving the £175,000 apartment he shares with his wife Fabiola and 15-year-old daughter Rossella in the coastal enclave of Meta di Sorrento, near Naples.

Yesterday, in a show of local support, a banner was put up outside his home saying:  ‘Captain, don’t give up’.

Costa said it had suspended Schettino and launched civil action for ‘significant misbehaviour’.

It said he was not receiving any support or legal aid from the company.

Divers resumed their search of the Concordia yesterday following a delay caused by the ship shifting position.

Susy Albertini, whose five-year-old daughter Dayana is missing, begged them to carry on.

‘Bring her home to me as soon as you can,’ she said.

Dayana was on holiday with her father, William Arlotti, 36, who is also missing.

Preparations are under way to remove the 2,200 tons of heavy duty diesel in the ship’s tanks – an operation expected to take a month.

Experts say sealife would be devastated were the oil to leak.
