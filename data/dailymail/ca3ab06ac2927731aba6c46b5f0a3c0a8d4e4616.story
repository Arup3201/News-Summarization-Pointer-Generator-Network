A mysterious balloon floating 800 feet over Manhattan today sparked an NYPD investigation.

The large white-and-blue object was spotted flying above the lower part of the borough this morning.

It appeared to be equipped with a drone-style camera,  suspended beneath the balloon by a rope.

Flight: The large object is pictured flying past One World Trade Center in the lower part of the borough today

The NYPD launched an investigation into the balloon after members of the public noticed it flying past One World Trade Center, Brookfield Place and other skyscrapers.

Officers quickly discovered it was tethered to a truck parked near the South Street Seaport. 

However, they later deemed the balloon to not be a threat. It remains unclear what its purpose was.

It is not the first time a mysterious object has been pictured floating over Manhattan.

In 2010, a series of unidentified shiny objects were spotted flying around 5,000 feet above the borough's West Side.

Police and the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) were flooded with calls from members of the public, with speculation that a UFO was soaring over the city.

Law enforcement sources said they believed the object was likely some sort of balloon, but could not confirm exactly what it is.

According to FAA guidelines, amateurs can fly unmanned aviation systems - the agency's term for drones and other remote-controlled devices - over certain areas of New York. 

However, the aircraft must remain under 400 feet,away from airports, in sight at all times and within designated flight areas, which do not include Manhattan.
