The bad-tempered Commons debate over Barclays was branded the ‘worst I have ever seen’ by the Deputy Speaker yesterday.

Nigel Evans accused MPs of ‘damaging the reputation of Parliament’ after shouting himself hoarse to bring the chamber to order as Chancellor George Osborne and Ed Balls exchanged insults on Thursday.

MPs approved government plans for Parliament to investigate the banking scandal instead of a judge-led public inquiry called for by Labour.

Chancellor George Osborne and his opposite number Ed Balls were involved in angry exchanges as MPs debated proposals for an inquiry into the banking scandal. MPs have voted for a Parliamentary probe into rate-fixing

Mr Evans, a Tory, said MPs were guilty of ‘bawling’ that made it impossible for MPs to hear what was being said.

Mr Osborne labelled shadow chancellor
Mr Balls, who was previously City minister, as ‘the man who smeared his
way through 13 years of Labour government’, adding ‘half the people who
ever served with him think he was a disgrace in his post.’

Mr Balls condemned the ‘cheap and 
partisan and desperate way in which you and your aides have conducted 
yourselves in recent days does you no good (and) it demeans the office 
you hold’.

The shouting from MPs was so loud 
that Mr Evans, standing in for Speaker John Bercow, had to yell ‘Order’ 
to be heard. He told the Mail: ‘It was by far the worst debate I have 
ever seen. It appeared to me that there was a lot more heat than light.

‘To have a proper debate you have to 
actually listen to what is said. I’m the last person to stop the cut and
thrust of debate and the odd interjection from a sedentary position but
when it descends into just shouting it does nothing for the debate.

‘It was very bad and my throat is still recovering.

‘People do tune in and listen to 
these debates and when it goes over the mark like that it doesn’t do the
reputation of the Parliament any good.

‘The noise was so bad that some MPs remarked they couldn’t actually hear the debate. It was frankly just a lot of bawling.’

Fire: Mr Balls insisted Labour would continue to press for a broader judicial probe as Parliament agreed to hold an inquiry led by politicians

The political war of words started 
when Mr Osborne accused his shadow of being involved in the fixing of 
the Libor rate, the price at which banks lend to each other, in The 
Spectator magazine.

He 
wrote: 'As for the role of the Labour government and the people around 
Gordon Brown – well, I think there are questions to be asked of them.

‘They
were clearly involved and we just haven’t heard the full facts, I don’t
think, of who knew what when. My opposite number was the City minister 
for part of this period and Gordon Brown’s right-hand man for all of it.
That’s Ed Balls, by the way.’

On Thursday Ed Miliband reluctantly agreed for Parliament to investigate the banking crisis though he insisted it would be ‘inadequate'.

Mr Balls said Labour would continue 
to press for a broader judicial probe to follow - warning the Government
that if future banking scandals emerged it would be blamed.

In the house Mr Osborne challenged Mr Balls to say
who were the ‘Labour ministers’ who raised concerns with the Bank of 
England about the high rates being declared by Barclays on how much it 
was paying to borrow at the height of the financial crisis.

‘Do
you know who those ministers are?’ the Chancellor demanded.

‘Let
him explain what Labour’s role was. Who were the ministers, who had the
conversation, who were the senior figures?’ Mr Osborne asked, saying Mr
Balls had to ‘answer for his time in office’ as Labour’s City minister.

The Chancellor mentioned a report 
called ‘Reducing Libor’ drafted by bankers at UBS and circulated in 
Whitehall by Baroness Vadera, then a Cabinet Office minister, in 2008.

The
peer, who was one of Gordon Brown’s closest economic advisers, has 
admitted commenting on the report but denied having any conversation 
with the Bank of England about getting the rate down.

Mr Balls denied any involvement and responded: 'The cheap and partisan and desperate way in which you and your aides have conducted yourselves .. demeans the office you hold.'

He complained that the Chancellor had ‘impugned my integrity’ and demanded an apology.

‘If he has any evidence, he should produce it. He should either push up or shut up,’ Mr Balls said.

The
Chancellor retorted: ‘The idea that I am going to take lessons in 
integrity from the man who smeared his way through 13 years of Labour 
government, who half the people who ever served with him think he was a 
disgrace in his post is another thing.’

Tory
MP Nadhim Zahawi asked Mr Balls: ‘Can you confirm that in your time in 
office, no other minister either in Number Ten or the Treasury spoke to 
the Bank of England on Libor that you know about?’

The Shadow Chancellor did not answer 
directly, telling him: ‘The reason why we advocate an open, public 
inquiry, judge-led, is to get precisely to the bottom of all these 
things.’
