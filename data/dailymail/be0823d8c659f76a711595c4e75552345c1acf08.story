A Chinese farmer who lit up a cigarette on board a flight to Bangkok claimed he had no idea that smoking on a plane was illegal.

Xu Miaoqing, 61, from mainland China, told a court he was illiterate and was unable to read the no smoking signs.

Mr Miaoqing had been caught smoking in the toilet on the Cathay Pacific flight on Christmas Day by flight attendants.

He had been given the ‘free trip’ as a present.

However, he has since been hit with a HK$2,000 (£170) fine after pleading guilty in Tsuen Wan Court in Hong Kong to a charge of smoking in an aircraft.

In addition to the fine, the court heard that the case had cost Xu dear.

He had to give up his travel documents during the investigation and the period he had spent in Hong Kong had cost the man a quarter of his income for the year. 

His holiday was meant to be free - a gift from his niece.

The court heard that a steward on flight CX708 went to the toilet cubicle after an alarm sounded.

Xu was inside and there was a strong smell of smoke. A cigarette butt was found in the toilet.

On arrival, he admitted to police that he had been smoking.

Xu's case is the latest in a series of incidents involving misbehaviour by mainland air passengers.

Last month, a Nanjing-bound flight turned back to Bangkok after a flight a passenger scalded a flight attendant with hot water from instant noodles.

Another threatened to bomb the plane in a row over seating. They were later banned from travelling by provincial authorities.

Days later, a passenger on a Xiamen Air flight from Hangzhou to Chengdu yanked open a door shortly before take-off to ‘get some fresh air’.

There was another brawl on a Hong Kong-bound flight from Chongqing over a crying baby.
