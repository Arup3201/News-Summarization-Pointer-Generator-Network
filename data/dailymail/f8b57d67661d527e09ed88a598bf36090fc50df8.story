Disgruntled: Atlon Nolen was allegedly angry about not getting a raise at work before he attacked

The Muslim convert accused of beheading a colleague in Oklahoma has reportedly told cops he felt oppressed at work - particularly over not getting a raise.

Alton Nolen, a 30-year-old production line employee for Vaughan Foods in Moore, was fired on Thursday after getting in trouble for his performance and for trying to convert colleagues to Islam, officials told CNN.

On Monday, law enforcement officials were preparing to file a murder charge against Nolen for walking back into Vaughan Foods after being fired and allegedly beheading 54-year-old grandmother Colleen Hufford.

He then allegedly began attacking 43-year-old Traci Johnson before being shot by Mark Vaughan, the company's chiefoperating officer who is also a sheriff's deputy.

Johnson is expected to recover, while Nolen  underwent surgery and is also expected to survive. 

Authorities waited until he was coherent and could
understand the charges before placing him under arrest on Friday
afternoon, they said.

He is also expected to face a charge of assault and battery with a deadly weapon for the stabbing of Johnson. 

The FBI is also looking into
Nolen's background for any  religious ties to the
attack after  colleagues said he had attempted to convert
them to Islam. Police said Nolen had recently become a Muslim.

The FBI investigation comes as Islamist militants fighting
in Iraq and Syria have released videos that purported to show
the beheadings of two Americans and a British aid worker.

On Nolen's Facebook page, listed under the name Jah'Keem Yisrael, he posted photos of Osama bin Laden and Taliban fighters, along with posts condemning a variety of aspects of American life.

Posts ranged from religious iconography to stock photography to even photos of supposed UFO activity. It also included a graphic photo of a beheading.

On Sunday, a woman who said she was Nolen's mother took to social media
to apologize to the victims of the attack.

'My heart is just so heavy right now,' Joyce Nolen said in a
Facebook post. 'My son was raised up
believing in God. I want to apologize to both families, because this is not
Alton.'

Convert: 30-year-old Nolen, who shared photos of Osama bin Laden and Taliban fighters to Facebook, is believed to have converted to Islam in prison before being released earlier this year

Megan Nolen, the suspect's sister, said in the same video
that Alton was not a violent person.

Nolen's family members have said also that they were surprised to learn of his conversion and never spoke about Islam explicitly with them.

'I spoke to him once he was released, and when we spoke, there was nothing of the sort,' said Nolen's cousin, James Fulsom, from Fort Worth, Texas. 'I don't believe he was converted (to Islam) in prison.'

As recently as February, Fulsom said that when he talked to Nolen there was no mention of his conversion.

'He was just talking about what he was going to start doing, how he was going to get his life on track, and was ready to be focused on his future,' Fulsom told the Associated Press.

Nolen had a non-violent criminal record, including drug-related arrests, a jail escape and resisting police,authorities said.

But it emerged that Nolen  served less than two years of a six-year prison sentence for possession of cocaine with intent to distribute, reports News OK. 

Heroic: He was only stopped when CEO and sheriff's reserve Mark Vaughan, pictured, shot him

He went to prison March 10, 2011 to start a two-year sentence for marijuana possession and another two-year sentence for assaulting a highway patrol trooper, the website reported.

He began his six-year sentence for cocaine possession April 26, 2011, records show - but due to plea agreements with prosecutors, he was allowed to serve the three prison sentences at the same time. He was released on March 22, 2013, records show. 

'Our intent was to incarcerate him much longer than a year and 11 months,' Oklahoma County District Attorney David Prater said Friday. 'This case perfectly illustrates the problem with the Department of Corrections.'

Hufford, who had been married for 25 years, had lost her family home in the Moore tornado.

Her neighbors described her as 'quick to smile' and said her husband picked her up from the food processing plant every night and he was outside when he found out she had been killed.
