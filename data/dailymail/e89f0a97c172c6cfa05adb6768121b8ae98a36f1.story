Speaker's wife Sally Bercow has for the first time revealed a tattoo dedicated to her three children.

The heart-shaped tribute to Oliver, nine, Freddie, eight, and Jemima, five, is on her left shoulder and was unveiled on a television programme where she was quizzed about being a celebrity mother.

While Mrs Bercow appeared to enjoy the limelight of being on TV, her youngest child struggled and was reduced to tears during the filming of ITV’s Big Star’s Little Star.

After getting stage-fright five-year-old 
Jemima was taken off three times during the hit show, which 
she took part in alongside her mother.

On show: Sally Bercow's tattoo was revealed to the nation on ITV last night, and it is a tribute to her three young children

Permanent: It is in the shape of a heart formed by the names of Oliver, nine, Freddie, eight, and Jemima, five

Stage fright: Five-year-old Jemima, pictured with host Stephen Mulhern and her mother, was taken off the stage three times during the hit show

The 43-year-old is rarely out of the spotlight and revealed earlier this year that she has her first tattoo, but refused to say where it was.

She was photographed outside a Chester parlour with Celebrity Big Brother friend Paddy Doherty, and both had one done at the same time.

Mrs Bercow has left Twitter after she libelled Tory peer Lord McAlpine, after she sent a tweet to her 56,000 followers falsely implying he was a paedophile.

But at the time of her new tattoo she wrote: 'Been dithering for years. Really pleased with this one, though - will never regret having tatt of my kids.

'Friends warned me but compared to childbirth (with gas & air!), it was a doddle!'

Good cause: On the show children of celebrities answering questions about their famous mother or father, who have to guess their response to win up to £15,000 for their choice of charity

Cast: Mrs Bercow was on the show with actress Suzanne Shaw and gardener Diarmuid Gavin in the battle for charity money

Success: Sally Bercow and her daughter Jemima raised £1,000 for the National Autistic Society, an organisation she supports because her son Oliver has autism

It was revealed on Big Star’s Little Star, hosted by Stephen Mulhern, which sees the children of celebrities answering questions about their famous mother or father, who have to guess their response to win up to £15,000 for their choice of charity.

ITV said Jemima was the only child out of 20 in the series to break down and find the whole experience too much.

A spokesman said the young girl appeared to get ‘stage fright’ after seeing all the people in the audience.

ITV said Jemima had been fine at a pre-recording at her family home but when on stage she broke down.

After she first broke down Mr Mulhern asked: ‘Has mummy tried to get out of you what you told us?’

As Jemima paused, Mrs Bercow, 43 – married to Commons Speaker John Bercow – prompted her to say no but the youngster replied: ‘Yes you have’.

The girl then started crying and was taken to one side before returning back on stage.

Joint effort: Sally had the tattoo done alongside Celebrity Big Brother friend Paddy Doherty and said she'd 'never regret having tatt of my kids'

The show, aired last night, and focused on questions about Mrs Bercow and not Mr Bercow, 50.

The spokesman told the Mail: ‘Jemima was the only contestant across the series to have stage fright, despite this, she still really wanted to take part in the show with her mum, who was with her throughout, and once she had spoken to Stephen backstage, she was happy to continue.’

One audience member said Jemima had been so upset it made for uncomfortable viewing. They told the Sun: ‘Jemima was very unhappy. We were told before she came on that she was very nervous.

Mrs Bercow is not the only contestant of the political persuasion to appear in the series, after Edwina Currie won £1,000 for Blythe House Hospice, alongside her granddaughter Zoe, seven.

Mrs Bercow is no stranger to reality television shows – having appeared on Celebrity Big Brother in 2011. Mr Bercow was less than happy, his wife admitted, when she signed up for the show – and even less so when she bragged about how she had taken him away for a dirty weekend to try and ease away his worries.
