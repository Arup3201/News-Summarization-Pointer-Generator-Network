Devastated: Dennis Dunstan, 70, had prepared three mince pies and shandy for Christmas but thieves stole them

A pensioner says his Christmas is ruined after burglars raided his home, stole his car, and ate his entire batch of homemade mince pies.

Dennis Dunstan, 70, woke to find thieves had taken thousands of pounds worth of valuables after forcing their way through his kitchen window.

They stole £150 from his wallet, a laptop, a digital camera and made off in his £5,000 Smart car.

Before they fled the scene, the gang took the shandy and three mince pies Mr Dunstan had prepared for Christmas Day.

Devastated, the retired builder from Nottingham said the attack has left him terrified to be in his own home.

He said: 'I woke up at 9am the next day and realised what had happened.

'I am a pensioner
 and to think they were in my flat while I was asleep is scary, they 
could have done anything to me.

'I checked my wallet, which I left on the table but it was above a cabinet, and it had £150 stolen from it.

'I started checking everything and noticed what they had taken and then when I randomly looked in the fridge, I don't know why I did, but I saw they had raided that too.

'I had three mince pies in there on a plate and they ate them and I had a can of shandy which they drank as well.

'For them to take my belongings, my car and laptop is one thing but it is just a complete cheek to steal my food too.

'It has ruined Christmas for me - I've been left with nothing and I can't even enjoy a mince pie.

'Mince pies are my favourite thing about Christmas Day, it is a tradition of mine and I can't even do that now.'

Nottinghamshire Police are now investigating the break-in which happened on December 13.

Officers
 found Dennis' car had been abandoned nearby but the rest of his 
belongings are still missing and no arrests have been made.

Upset: Mr Dunstan has urged police to catch the thieves who drove off in his car and ruined his Christmas

Dennis added: 'They need to be caught.

'It isn't nice to not feel safe in your own home and the fact all this happened just before Christmas makes it worse.

'You feel helpless though, if they would have woken me I wouldn't have been able to do anything.

'I told my friends about what happened and they were shocked, I am just glad I wasn't physically hurt, this could have been so much worse than what it was.'

A spokesman for Nottingham City Homes, which runs Mr Dunstan's housing development, said: 'We were very sorry to hear about the burglary.

'As a result of the comments about security we will be sending out members of staff to see if anything else can be done to make the scheme more secure.'

Anyone with information about the burglary is asked to call police on 101 or Crimestoppers on 0800 555111.
