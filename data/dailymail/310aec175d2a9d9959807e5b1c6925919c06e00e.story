19 Kids and Counting stars Jessa and Jill Duggar are reported to be in the midst of a bitter fight, after it was revealed that mother-to-be Jill, 23, had unfollowed her younger sister - and her new husband Ben Seewald - on Twitter.

According to The Inquisitr, Jill, who is expecting her first child, a son, with husband Derick Dillard in March, is linked with all of her other Twitter-using family members, however Jessa and Ben's accounts are noticeably absent from her 16-strong follow list, which also includes Walmart and Fox News.

It seems the resentment might not be mutual however; newly-wed Jessa follows both Jill and Derick, who is also listed as one of her followers.

Squabbling sisters? Rumors have surfaced of a rift between the Duggar siblings after Jill (R) unfollowed Jessa (L) on Twitter

The reports will no doubt come as a shock to fans of the Duggar's hit reality series, who are used to seeing the siblings getting on incredibly well - particularly while helping each other to prepare for their respective wedding ceremonies, which both took place this year.

While the reason behind the feud is not known, it is thought that the feud could have something to do with the girls' respective engagements and wedding ceremonies being so close together - and it has been speculated that Jessa felt her courtship with Ben was slightly overshadowed by the announcement of Jill's pregnancy.

And it is not the first time that rumors of tension between Jessa and her siblings have surfaced.

Earlier this year, eldest Duggar daughter Jana, 24, revealed in the family's tell-all biography Growing Up Duggar: It’s All About Relationships that she and Jessa regularly fought throughout much of their childhood. 

According to Jana, her parents Jim Bob and Michelle tried to end the sisters' constant fighting by making them share a bunk bed, which only resulted in Jessa continuing to torment her sibling by kicking her bunk every night and then laughing when she became upset.

But while Jessa and and Jana seem to have repaired their relationship, it remains to be seen whether the same will be said of Jessa and Jill and their husbands, both of whom were welcomed into the family fold by patriarch Jim Bob earlier this year.

In June, Jill married 25-year-old accountant Derick, sharing her first kiss with her new husband in front of 1,000 of their closest friends and family members during the ceremony, which was later broadcast in a special episode of 19 Kids and Counting.

'It was so cute - I thought Jill almost dove right into the moment,' the Duggar matriarch Michelle later said of the couple's first kiss. 'I was really surprised, but on the other hand, I'm not. I just think Jill is quite the enthusiastic person.' 

Interestingly, Jessa, who wed 19-year-old Ben on November 1, chose to wait until after the ceremony before enjoying her first kiss with her new husband so the couple could share the moment in private. 

'They wanted their very first kiss ever to be in private,' Pastor Mike Schadt told People. 'It was important to the both of them.'

When it came to preparing for their special days, mother Michelle revealed on her blog that both sisters received huge amounts of support from their siblings. 

'Jill had so much help from her siblings to make the transition, helping her pack up her stuff at our house, moving and unpacking at her new home,' she wrote. 'They have their schedule already - they get up and off to work or Jill works on her studies.'

In an earlier post, the mother-of-19 also discussed the difficulties involved in saying farewell to two of her children within such a short space of time.   

'Change can be difficult for all of us, but it is such a good reason to have change. It's a joyful time,' she explained. '[Jim Bob] is so excited, too, for Derick and Jill, and for Ben and Jessa. 

'When he talks about the girls getting married, he gets a little teary-eyed; it's a big deal for a dad to let go of his girls. He's handing them over, but he's handing them over to some really great guys.'
