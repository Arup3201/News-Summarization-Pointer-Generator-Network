Prosecutors said Monday they will not file criminal charges against a Northern California sheriff's deputy who shot and killed a 13-year-old boy carrying a pellet gun he mistook for an assault rifle.

The parents of Andy Lopez decried the decision, saying 'it is impossible' to accept and they felt as though their son 'had been killed again.'

The teen's death last year heightened racial tensions in a mostly Latino neighborhood of Santa Rosa, a city of about 170,000 residents around 50 miles north of San Francisco. The shooting parked protests and criticism that the officer acted too quickly.

Mistake: Deputy Gelhaus told investigators that he believed the eighth-grader was carrying an assault rifle, and only later found out that it was a toy BB gun

Deputy Erick Gelhaus, 48, fired multiple rounds in response to what he believed was an imminent threat of death, Sonoma County District Attorney Jill Ravitch announced at a news conference.

'While in the lawful performance of his duty, Deputy Gelhaus was faced with a highly unpredictable and rapidly evolving situation,' Ravitch said. 'He believed honestly and reasonably that he was faced with a do-or-die dilemma.'

'While this was an absolute tragedy it was not a criminal act,' Ravitch said.

Ravitch displayed photographs of the pellet gun found next to Lopez and a real assault rifle to highlight similarities in appearance.

Gelhaus shot Lopez on October 22 as the teen walked near his home with the pellet gun. The deputy told investigators he believed the gun was real and opened fire out of fear for his life.

At least one witness said he heard the deputy order Lopez to drop the pellet gun before shooting, Ravitch said.

Gelhaus fired eight times, striking the eighth-grader seven times with his department-issued 9 mm handgun. The district attorney said Gelhaus had 18 rounds in his gun and stopped shooting when he felt the threat had ended. Lopez was declared dead at the scene.

'This disheartening decision leaves the family feeling as though Andy had been killed again today,' Lopez parents said in a prepared statement released by their lawyer, Arnoldo Casillas.

Casillas represents the family in a wrongful death lawsuit filed in federal court in San Francisco against the county and Gelhaus, which has been on hold pending the outcome of the district attorney's investigation. Casillas said he will petition the court to restart the litigation.

Scorn: Human rights attorney Jonathan Melrod spoke after the decision, saying 'the militarization of the police is evolving into "us versus them"'

Casillas said 'it is impossible' to accept Ravitch's conclusions and that he and the family are asking federal officials to investigate.

Human rights attorney Jonathan Melrod spoke, saying Lopez was shot 't because he was a kid carrying a toy gun where kids play. The militarization of the police is evolving into "us versus them."'

The FBI said it is looking into the shooting to determine if any civil rights violations occurred. The district attorney forwarded her report to federal investigators.

FBI agent Brian Weber said investigators have 'collected and reviewed documents and other evidence produced in connection with this matter and is working with the United States Attorney's Office and the Department of Justice in Washington, D.C.' Weber declined further comment.

Dangerous place: Part of what factored into Deputy Gelhaus's decision to open fire was that Lopez's neighborhood has been plagued with gun violence. Above, a scene of the neighborhood after Lopez was shot

Those who have protested the shooting said the deputy did not give ample warning before opening fire. Investigators have said 10 seconds elapsed between the time Gelhaus and a trainee reported a 'suspicious person' and then reported shots fired to dispatchers. The trainee did not open fire.

Ravitch said her office's findings will not alleviate the pain felt by Lopez's family or the community.

Sonoma County Sheriff Steve Freitas said an internal investigation also concluded Gelhaus and his partner acted appropriately and that the department would now evaluate the incident to determine if 'there are things we can do differently going forward, or to improve performance in general.'

Freitas called for passage of a state Senate bill introduced in January that would require pellet guns to look clearly different from those that fire bullets.

After a long delay, District Attorney Jill Ravitch announced today that she will not be filing criminal charges against Erick Gelhaus, the Sonoma County Sheriff’s Deputy who shot and killed 13-year-old Andy Lopez.

This disheartening decision leaves the family feeling as though Andy had been killed again today. It is impossible to accept Ravitch’s conclusion that Gelhaus shot and killed Andy in response to what he 'honestly and reasonably believed was an imminent threat of death to himself or others.' No reasonable officer in such circumstances could believe he was encountering anything but a teenager with a toy gun on a sunny afternoon in a residential area.Erick Gelhaus’ exaggerated and careless response deserves a truly transparent and impartial evaluation. Ms. Ravitch’s conclusion is a mockery of justice and confirms that her office cannot meaningfully sit in judgment of local law enforcement. This cowardly political decision sends the tacit message that law enforcement officials who use excessive force in Sonoma County will not suffer meaningful consequences and, instead, will enjoy immunity from local prosecution.The family, through their attorney, will petition the U.S. District court for the immediate lifting of the stay of the proceedings as to Erick Gelhaus and thereby allow the civil case to move forward as to him and Sonoma County.The family will also urge the Civil Rights Division of the U.S. Attorney’s office to conduct an impartial investigation as to the shooting and killing of Andy Lopez.Lastly, for those who share their anguish over this decision, the family asks that the Sonoma County community to continue to observe peace.
