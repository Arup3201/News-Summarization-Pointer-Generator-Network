Two bodyguards have been convicted of attempted murder for shooting at two photographers trying to get shots of supermodel Gisele Bundchen's wedding in 2009.

Miguel Solis and Alexander Rivas were each sentenced to five years behind bars and ordered to pay each victim $10,000 in restitution on Friday.

A third bodyguard, Manuel Valverde, was cleared of all charges.

Love birds: Power couple Tom Brady and Gisele Bundchen got married in 2009 in Costa Rica

When Brazilian model married American football star Tom Brady four years ago, paparazzi swarmed  her seaside house in Costa Rica.

Two photographers trying to shoot the wedding from a nearby property claimed two bodyguards approached them, demanding they hand over their cameras' memory cards.

It is not clear if they refused.

However, as they attempted to drive away, the bodyguards opened fire.

Photographer Rolando Aviles said a 
bullet shot through his Suzuki's front and back windows, narrowly 
missing him and his colleague, AFP Central America bureau chief Uri 
Cortez.

Central America bureau chief for AFP, Uri Cortez, told police Bundchen's security team fired a bullet at him as he sat in his car, smashing the rear window and bouncing off the front windscreen (pictured), missing his head by inches

'The bullet went between us, missing our heads. If the bullet been a little more to the left or right, it would have killed one of us,' Aviles said.

'I said, "They're going to kill us," and that's when I hunched down to cover myself.

'When the glass broke, that's when my friend started driving really fast.

'I could have lost my life for the sale of some pictures that Gisele didn't want published. Are they insane?'

The snappers were not injured. 

At the time, NFL player Tom Brady insisted the claims were untrue.

'It's absolute b.s. We found two guys on our property, and we told them to get out. Our security didn't even have guns. There were no shots fired (sic),' he said.

Bundchen claimed she didn't know about the shooting.

The power couple have two children, Benjamin, three, and Vivian, eight months.
