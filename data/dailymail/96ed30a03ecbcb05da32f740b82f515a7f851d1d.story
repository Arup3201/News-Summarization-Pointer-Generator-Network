Margaret Thatcher's spectacular ceremonial funeral cost the taxpayer just £1.2million, just a fraction of the sum claimed by left-wing opponents.

The final bill for the ceremony at St Paul's Cathedral was revealed by ministers today in a rebuff to critics who suggested the costs would top £10million.

Officials said that detailed work on the price of security, policing, staff over-time and hiring the Cathedral meant the total was much lower than early estimates suggested.

National tribute: Prime Minister David Cameron gave a reading during the funeral service of Baroness Thatcher on April 17

Venue: The bill for St Paul's Cathedral came to £67,908, the government revealed

In April the Cabinet Office published an early estimate of the funeral costs, which came to £3.6million.

It included around £2million for policing by 4,000 officers who would have been on duty anyway.

The new figure published today covers ‘marginal costs’ spent specifically on the funeral for Britain's first female Prime Minister, as opposed to spending on salaries and buildings which would have been incurred any way.

On the morning of the funeral, Labour frontbencher Diane Abbott complained about the bill.

'There is just no precedent, it’s a breach of protocol and it’s going to cost £10million,' she claimed, in what now appears to be a vast overestimate.

Tory MP Conor Burns, a close friend of Baroness Thatcher, said: 'Lady T would have been delighted that, even in death, she has proved the Left wrong.'

The confirmed costs for organising the funeral were £261,976, including staff overtime, down from £500,000 estimated in April.

It included £31,978 by the Cabinet Office, £7,000 by the City of London Corporation, £78,244 by the Foreign Office, £8,311 by the Greater London Authority and  £20,445 by the London Ambulance Service.

Lady Thatcher had requested a strong military element to her funeral, in recognition of her victory in the Falklands War.

The Ministry of Defence spent £39,057 while the Houses of Parliament spent £1,700, Transport for London £1,000 and £6,333 by Westminster City Council.

The breakdown of figures show St Paul’s Cathedral cost £67,908.

The direct policing and security costs for the funeral came to £943,833, down from an estimate of £1.1million in April

The bulk of the bill came from £845,600 from the Met, while the British Transport Police spent £25,233 and City of London Police £73,000.

Cabinet Office minister Lord Wallace said: ‘No public money was spent on the reception at the Guildhall, which was paid for by the City of London Corporation and not out of public funds.

Friends of the Iron Lady said the ceremony was a fitting tribute to Britain's first female Prime Minister

‘Further costs were met by Baroness Thatcher’s estate,’ he added in a statement to Parliament.

More than 2,300 mourners joined Lady Thatcher's daughter Carol and son Mark at the ceremony.

The Queen and Prince Philip broke with tradition to attend the funeral of a former Prime Minister for the first time since Winston Churchill.

Baroness Thatcher was honoured with a sombre but spectacular funeral ceremony that paid tribute to the ‘courage and perseverance’ of Britain's greatest peacetime prime minister.

Under the great dome of St Paul's Cathedral, the Queen joined dignitaries from 170 countries worldwide, friends, political foes and Lady Thatcher's closest family members to celebrate the life of the UK's first and only female premier.

London's streets were also packed with mourners who broke into spontaneous applause and gave cheers and whistles of support as the coffin passed by.

The emotional crowds threw white roses in the path of the gun carriage that carried Lady Thatcher through the capital, while many of the 2,300 inside St Paul's openly sobbed with Chancellor George Osborne 'overwhelmed'.

Outside on the streets, the predicted protests and disorder failed to materialise, with the few boos drowned out by supporters' applause.

As Big Ben once again started to chime after the 11am service, the procession started its final journey.

Lady Thatcher's twins Sir Mark and Carol looked moved throughout and her grandchildren Michael and Amanda were waiting at the cathedral door holding cushions bearing the insignia of the Order of the Garter and the Order of Merit, which they then placed on the Dome Altar as the coffin arrived.

Margaret Thatcher's only granddaughter Amanda also paid a heartfelt tribute to the former Prime Minister with a perfectly-delivered reading.
