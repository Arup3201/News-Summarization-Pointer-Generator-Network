Many drivers, tired of long journeys and tedious traffic jams, are looking forward to when self-driving cars will be an affordable option.

And while Google and car makers are working on the next generation of vehicles, a $10,000 (£5,900) gadget could beat the big firms to controlling your car remotely, as soon as next year.

The Cruise RP-1 claims to be the world’s first ‘highway autopilot’ and can take control of car on a motorway, keeping it safely in lane and a suitable distance from the car in front.

The Cruise RP-1 claims to be the world’s first ‘highway autopilot’ and can take control of car on a motorway, keeping it safely in lane and a suitable distance from the car in front.

It comprises a rooftop sensor unit, computer in the boot and control panel next to the driver.

The 'sensor pod' relays what it detects back to the ‘Cruise computer’ to make real-time decisions on where to position itself on the road.

It uses computer vision and obstacle detection algorithms to work out where to place the car.

If a car pulls in front suddenly, the system can brake and adjust the speed quickly.

At launch, the RP-1 will only be available for Audi A4 and S4 models built after 2012 - but more cars systems are in development.

It can only currently be used in California and is not intended as a replacement for a driver.

The gadget can be pre-ordered for $10,000 and is expected to be ready next year.

The gadget, designed by Kyle Vogt,comprises a rooftop sensor unit, computer in the boot and control panel next to the driver.

It can be pre-ordered and is expected to be ready next year.

By comparison, Google has said that its automated cars will arrive between 2017 and 2020.

Vogt said: ‘Seven years ago I worked on an autonomous vehicle project but I was frustrated that the computational and sensing systems used were too expensive and too bulky to use…in a regular vehicle.’

So he designed the Cruise RP-1, which sees the road and cars around a vehicle by using a sensor pod mounted on a car’s roof.

Through a combination of sensors, 
cameras, radar, and other measurement systems, the ‘sensor pod’ relays 
what it detects back to the ‘Cruise computer’ to make real-time 
decisions on where to position the car on the road.

The technology is reasonably cheap because it uses sensors already harnessed in other vehicles.

‘Using advance computer vision and obstacle detection, the RP-1 keeps you in your lane and a safe distance from vehicles in front of you,’ the company said.

‘It’s always watching the road even if you are distracted - and frees you from the pain of commuting, stop-and-go traffic and long trips. Just sit back and enjoy the ride.’

If the car sees danger or that a car has just cut in front, it can brake or change speed

‘The radar allows us to determine the velocity and direction of any car around you to ensure there is enough distance for your car to come to a complete stop if there is ever a problem,’ the company explained.

If the RP-1 is ‘in doubt’ about what it sees – such as sketchy lane markings – it alerts the driver using visual and sound alerts to ask them to take over driving completely.

The system can be installed into any Audi A4 or S4 built after 2012, although the company plans to roll out versions for other cars next year.

The autopilot can be turned on and off with a button integrated beside the driver, whereas the ‘brains’ of the system is stowed in the boot of a car and takes up less than two feet of space.

Currently, the system can only be used on major highways in California - specifically in the San Francisco Bay Area, which has been mapped by the company, Recode reported. There are no plans to release it in the UK.

The company stresses that its system is not a replacement for a driver, who must sit in the driver’s seat and be prepared to take full control of the car at any time.

‘All state and federal driving laws still apply while the RP-1 is in operation,’ it warned.
