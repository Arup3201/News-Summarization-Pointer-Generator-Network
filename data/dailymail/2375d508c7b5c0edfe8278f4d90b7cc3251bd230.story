BBC plans to force freelance presenters back on to the employment books to end suspicions of tax avoidance have descended into chaos, it emerged last night,

Stars are being made to sign short-term contracts because the BBC has been unable to thrash out an acceptable way of paying them on a full time basis.

The corporation decided to act following concerns from MPs about the corporation’s use of so-called personal service companies as a way of channelling stars’ earnings.

In November, the BBC said it had identified 131 employees - either paid through service companies or on freelance deals - who would be asked to become staff members.

But the corporation is struggling to come up with a way of enforcing its new rules.

It is understood that the diverse and complicated ways many performers earn their money has made it incredibly difficult to come up with a single system that is fair.

As a result, the corporation has ‘extended’ and ‘continued’ contracts, or in some cases issued new deals with clauses which admit it may have to be ‘torn up’ .

But even once the BBC has come up with a plan it then faces a battle with high profile stars who are likely to resist attempts to make them members of staff.

Last year after weeks of controversy the BBC admitted that the personal service company deals gave individuals a ‘greater opportunity’ to reduce their tax liability.

Speaking of the current problems in deciding who should go back on the BBC payroll, one influential agent described it as a ‘complete debacle’.

They claimed the BBC was still trying to ‘thrash out’ by what criteria people should be put back on staff.

In November the BBC said a new ‘employment test’, which determines whether a staff contract was appropriate, would be in place by April 2013.

Stars such as Fiona Bruce and Jeremy Paxman, who said they were told to set up personal service companies by the BBC to get their salaries, could be among those asked to become employees.

Today programme presenter John Humphrys, who is not paid through a service company but is a freelancer, has signed a nine-month extension to his contract. The short-length of the extension to his contract is thought to be linked to the deadlock over how the BBC pays its presenters.

In future, BBC contracts will also contain clauses requiring employees to demonstrate that they are paying the appropriate level of tax.

Last year’s review found that at least 124 top names earn £150,000 or more via the companies. A further 54 freelance stars got a similar amount.

A BBC spokesman said: ‘Following a review last year, the BBC is changing the way it contracts with a small number of presenting and on air talent. While these changes are being finalised we need to extend some contracts that are due to be renewed for a short period of time.’
