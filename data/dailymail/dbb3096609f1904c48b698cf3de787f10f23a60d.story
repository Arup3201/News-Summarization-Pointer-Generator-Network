Mix-up? Mother-of-three- Melisah Havens, 34, was arrested Friday night after critically shooting her husband, but she says she mistook him from a stranger

An Arizona mother of three was arrested on Friday night for shooting her husband, but says she mistook him for an intruder trying to break into her car.

Melisah Havens, 34, called police at 8:30 pm and when they arrived on the scene, they could hear her yelling 'help me, help me' before finding her hovering over his body.

Havens' 35-year-old husband was shot once in the chest and once in the right hand. He was immediately air lifted to a Phoenix trauma hospital for treatment where he was also reported in critical but stable condition.Â 

'Melisah told detectives she shot her husband because she thought he was going to burglarize her vehicle,' Pinal County Sheriff Paul Babeu told AZfamily.com.

'She also said that he had taken her keys and was going to get milk. Melisah declined to provide any additional information after making these statements.'

Sheriff Babeu says deputies have responded to domestic violence calls at the same address before.

Inside the house, deputies found havens' three children, ages 12, 10 and 2, sitting on the couch.

They also found a pump shotgun in the master bedroom closet.

Detectives are waiting until Haven's husband is able to speak again to interview him on his side of the story.

Meanwhile, Haves was booked at the Pinal County Jail on one count of domestic violence/aggravated assault with a deadly weapon.

Their three children were put in the custody of Child Protective Services.
