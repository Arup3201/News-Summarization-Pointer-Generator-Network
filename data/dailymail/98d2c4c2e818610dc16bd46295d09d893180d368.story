Manchester City’s Manuel Pellegrini has admitted he allowed himself a smile when Robin van Persie scored a late goal for Manchester United on Sunday.

In derby week, that is something you do not hear very often. For City boss Pellegrini, however, the Van Persie goal that turned three Chelsea points into one at Old Trafford was perhaps the best moment of a week that underlined City’s uncertain form once again.

Having let a two-goal lead slip to draw in the Champions League at CSKA Moscow last Tuesday, Pellegrini’s team subsequently lost at West Ham in the Barclays Premier League. Ahead of Wednesday’s Capital One Cup tie at home to Newcastle, City still search for consistency.

Asked if he cheered when Van Persie scored, Pellegrini said with a laugh: ‘I don’t remember. At that moment I thought the game was finished and I went to drink a glass of water. When they told me after how the game finished I smiled.’

That is as close as Pellegrini is likely to come to a show of emotion, in public anyway.

Nevertheless the Chilean knows that, with United to come at the Etihad on Sunday, his team are fortunate to be only six points behind Chelsea.

‘This year maybe we are playing in irregular form,’ he said. ‘Maybe some parts of the game are well, and others not so well.

‘We are always clear that we need to improve and we are thinking about the best way to do it.

‘It’s very difficult to analyse the whole of last season and compare with just some games of this season. Last year we had one point less than we do this year. We didn’t start so well as I wanted last year either.

‘I think it’s important to have some clean sheets. As a team you play easily or you play with more trust when you don’t concede any easy goals at the beginning.

‘But we must improve in general, not just the defending. We must create more chances, we must score more goals. We are working on that and I am sure we will return to be the same team we were in the most important part of last season.’

As often with the City manager, there was some contradiction in his message on Tuesday. What he was clear about, however, was his team’s need to win on Wednesday, on Sunday and then at home to CSKA in the Champions League next week.

He said: ‘I think we must win the three games. They are three important competitions.’

City welcome back forward Samir Nasri into their squad for the Newcastle match after a month and a half out with a groin problem.

Meanwhile, Pellegrini has paid little heed to news that United striker Wayne Rooney had been limping this week ahead of Sunday’s game.

‘We really don’t change our way to play for one player,’ he said. ‘If it’s not Wayne Rooney it will be Angel di Maria, Juan Mata or Robin van Persie. They have so many creative players. We cannot prepare for a game talking about one player.’
