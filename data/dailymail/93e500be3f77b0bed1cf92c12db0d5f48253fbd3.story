A controversial planning shake-up means councils are being forced by government inspectors to allow more house-building  than they want to, it emerged last night.

Almost a half of authorities who have submitted their local planning proposals have had to increase their housing targets as a prerequisite to getting them signed off, a survey has found.

Campaigners said the diktats meant that more homes will have to be built in the countryside.

The pressure on rural Britain follows the introduction late last month of the government’s new planning regime, which critics say make it more difficult to oppose plans to build homes and offices on greenfield sites.

Under the new regime, all councils have to come up with local plans, which include a target for the number of homes to be built over the next few years.

However, before they can become operative they have to be signed off by an inspector by the Planning Inspectorate.

The system replaced the ‘regional special strategies’, plans which covered a wider area and which were introduced by Labour.

Planning consultancy Nathaniel Lichfield & Partners has looked at all 55 local plans examined or submitted for examination in the year since the National Planning Policy Framework was introduced.

Shockingly, 44 per cent of the plans that passed examination by the Planning Inspectorate had to raise their submitted housing targets in order to be found sound, reported Planning magazine.

Last night Douglas Carswell, Conservative MP for Clacton, said: ‘If the council decides it wants more homes, I’m not against them. But it should be entirely up to them, not central government.

‘I do not understand why the Government feels it has to ride roughshod over local councils and impose new targets on them. This is the sort of thing I would have expected John Prescott to have done.’

Fiona Howie, head of planning at the Campaign to Protect Rural England, said: ‘This seems to clearly contradict the commitment in the Coalition Agreement, and oft repeated at that, to abolish top-down  decision-making and return  powers on housing and planning to local councils.’
