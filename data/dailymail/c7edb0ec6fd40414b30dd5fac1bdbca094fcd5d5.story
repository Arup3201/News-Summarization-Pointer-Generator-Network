Horrendous: Shawn Custis, 43, has been indicted on seven counts after being caught on camera beating a woman in her home last year

A home invader whose vicious attack on a mother in front of her child was captured on the family's 'nanny cam' last year has been indicted on seven counts, including attempted murder.

Shawn Custis, 43, was caught on camera repeatedly kicking and punching a Millburn woman before throwing her down the stairs as her terrified three-year-old daughter cowered on the sofa on June 21.

The woman was left with a concussion, chipped teeth, an injured lip, facial swelling and leg injuries.

The convicted robber was today indicted by a grand jury of attempted murder, first-degree robbery, second-degree burglary, third-degree endangering the welfare of a child, third-degree criminal restraint, third-degree theft, and second-degree aggravated assault, according to nj.com. 

The horrific attack sparked outrage when police released the footage in a bid to track down the perpetrator.

Custis was arrested a week after the attack when police released his photo and name.

The disturbing video shows the moment Curstis broke into the woman's home about 10am as she and her child watched television.

The woman's 18-month-old son was sleeping in an upstairs room.

Curtis began to attack the helpless mother who later told NBC4 she was afraid to cry out in case it made her daughter scream and anger her attacker.

Arrested: A week after the June 21, 2013, attack, Shawn Custis was arrested when police released his name and picture

'I
 knew that if I started screaming, my daughter would, too, and I was 
afraid she would get hurt. I took it. I didn’t cry the entire time,' she said.

After punching and kicking the woman at least 16 times, video shows the attacker turn and speak to the woman's daughter.

At one point, the invader seems to make physical contact with the child, but she was not injured.

The woman's husband was at work in New York City when the invasion took place.

The robber made off with an undetermined amount of jewelry, according to NBC News.

Police
 believe the suspect thought he would be alone when he entered the home 
as the blinds were drawn and there was no car in the driveway.

Deeply shaken: The young mother was tossed around ruthlessly, and beaten and kicked over and over as her infant son slept upstairs and cartoons played on the television

Merciless: The woman was kicked and punched even as she lay helplessly on the ground and the thief appears to pocket items from her person or the table beside her

Custis is being held on $750,000 bail and is scheduled to be arraigned on February 28 before Superior Court Judge Peter J. Vazquez, nj.com reported.

Olubukola 'Buki' Adetula, a pool attorney representing Custis, said his client would enter a not guilty plea at next month's arraignment. Custis pleaded not guilty to the charges in July.

'It is our intent to defend this case as aggressively as possible in a court of law,' Adetula said.

Custis is reportedly no stranger to the criminal justice system.

Nj.com last year reported the man has been in and out of jail for robbery, assault, resisting arrest, eluding police, theft and forgery convictions.

Lasting: The attack occurred Friday morning while the woman's husband was at work in New York City. She was treated for a concussion and extensive bruising

Blind sided: The attack occurred on this tree-lined, Essex County, New Jersey street. The victim's blinds were closed and no car was in the driveway. Police believe the invader thought no one was home

Scarring: The little girl, 3, is seen here blurred at left. She watched her mother being attacked and at one point the invader appears to speak to her and possibly make contact with her. She was unharmed

Loose: The thief shoved the woman down the basement stairs and made off with an unknown amount of jewelry. He remains at large and police think he's done this before
