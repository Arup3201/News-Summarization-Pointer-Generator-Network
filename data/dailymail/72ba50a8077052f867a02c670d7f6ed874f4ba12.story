President Barack Obama and his family enjoyed a leisurely bike ride on Friday while vacationing on the island of Martha's Vineyard.

The president, First Lady Michelle Obama and their daughter Malia were seen cycling together down the Manuel F. Correllus State Forest bike path outside West Tisbury, Massachusetts, this afternoon.

It was not immediately clear where Sasha Obama, the younger Obama daughter, was during the family outing.

It wasn't immediately clear where Sasha, the Obama's other daughter, was during the outing. She has not been seen with her family since before they began their summer vacation last Saturday

The president rode bikes with his family for a little less than an hour before breaking off to go play golf

Sasha did not accompany her family to 
Martha's Vineyard when they left Washington, D.C. last Saturday.

The 
White House has said she'll be joining her family for part of their 
two-week summer vacation, but she has yet to be seen.

Reporters traveling with first family on vacation said the president spent just under half an hour biking with his wife and daughter before breaking away to hit the links.

Obama is playing his fifth game of golf today since arriving on the island. He was joined today by 32 Advisors Founder and CEO Robert Wolf.

Wolf is a hedge fund and money manager who served on Obama's now-defunct Jobs Council.

Today was the first time that the Obamas, sans Sasha, have been seen hanging out together since the start of their 15 day vacation

Today is the first time the Obama family,
 sans Sasha, have been seen hanging out together since the start of their
 15 day vacation.

The president's two-week holiday has been half work, half play, as crises domestically and abroad demanded his attention.

Obama
 refused to cancel his summer vacation as a the fighting in Iraq raged 
on, but took time to make an on-camera statement on the situation from 
the lawn of his vacation home on Monday.

He
 again briefed Americans on Thursday afternoon, speaking both on Iraq 
and on the civil unrest in Ferguson, Missouri, after a white police 
officer shot and killed an unarmed 18-year-old, African-American 
resident of the town.

President Obama has played golf five times in the last seven days

Today he is playing on Farm Neck Golf Club course in Oak Bluffs, Massachusetts

Today Obama played golf with Robert Wolf, a hedge fund manager who served on his now-defunct Jobs Council

When Obama hasn't been working on the trip, he's been on the golf course with a rotating group of friends, including Cyrus Walker, the cousin of White House senior adviser Valerie Jarrett, and former U.S. Trade Representative Ron Kirk.

The president has played golf every day of his trip except Monday and Wednesday.

On Monday the White House says the Obamas went to the beach. No photos of that family outing have emerged, however.

The president and first lady were spotted, however, out at dinner on Tuesday night at the Sweet Life Cafe in Oak Bluffs, Massachusetts, with Obama administration officials Susan Rice and Eric Holder and their spouses. Kirk and his spouse also went on the outing.

The following evening the White House says the Obamas danced the night away at the birthday party of a friend.

An attendee of the dinner, held at the Farm Neck Golf Club, posted a photo of the president cutting a rug on the dance floor at the celebration, but it has since been deleted.

The Obamas are scheduled to stay in Martha's Vineyard through Sunday, August 24, however the president will take a two-day trip back to Washington this Sunday.

It's unknown why Obama is heading back to the White House in the middle of his trip, as his spokesperson is staying on Martha's Vineyard and Vice President Biden is scheduled to be away until Tuesday - the day Obama plans to return to his vacation spot.

The White House has stated that the president has 'meetings' he needs to attend in Washington and has declined to go in detail on Obama's mid-vacation agenda.
