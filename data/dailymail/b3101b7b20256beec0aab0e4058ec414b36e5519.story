England’s Twenty20 opener Alex Hales has spoken of his frustration after being omitted from the one-day squad for the series against Sri Lanka.

Hales produced one of the innings of the tournament at the recent World Twenty20 in Bangladesh, smashing an unbeaten 116 off 64 against the Sri Lankans – England’s opponents at The Kia Oval on Tuesday in a one-off Twenty20 game.

But the Nottinghamshire batsman cannot find a way into England’s struggling 50-over side, despite being ranked No 3 in the world in the 20-over game.

Asked if he was in danger of being pigeon-holed, Hales replied: ‘A little bit, yes, and I think it’s a little bit harsh. Up until last year, when I had a shocker with the red ball, I’d averaged 40 opening at Trent Bridge, which is not a bad record at all.

‘I’m keen to learn from last year and move on. It’s too early to be pigeon-holed as a T20 player. I am working hard on other aspects of the game.’

Hales, who has already spent a short spell on loan with Worcestershire this summer in search of first-class runs, has his eye on the next year’s 50-over World Cup in Australia and New Zealand.

But he feels he could boost England’s one-day side this summer too. ‘I feel if they gave me a chance this summer I’d be ready for it,’ he said. ‘I’ve seen a lot of Sri Lanka and seen a bit of India.’

Tuesday’s match, which is followed by five one-day internationals and two Tests against the Sri Lankans, is England’s first home match under new coach Peter Moores.

Hales said: ‘The winter was disappointing in all aspects and the World Cup didn’t go to plan either. There’s been a change in management and, with this game being a one-off, everyone is really up for it to get the public back with us.’
