In a real life story akin to Kevin Bacon's quest in the 1984 film Footloose, illegal dancing in the street has broken out in a Utah town as residents fight for their right to boogie.

Citizens of St George, Utah, took to the streets in a 'dance protest' after clashing with authorities over laws that require a permit to allow dancing in public.

Dancing without a permit could result in arrests for inciting a riot using laws that critics say infringe on their constitutional rights.

The party-pooper law was highlighted last month when the town's annual Monster Mash party was raided by six police officers who informed organizers dancing was prohibited according to the fine print of the event's party permit.

Partygoers were instructed via loudspeaker there was to be no dancing.

As the other activities continued, officers stayed at the party to ensure no rebellious dancing broke out.

Now residents have taken to the streets in a protest - mirroring Kevin Bacon's character in the seminal 1980s film Footloose, in which he successfully overturns a small town's laws using the only power of dance.

Jared Keddington, the organizer of the Monster Mash event, said St George was becoming 'notorious' for its rules, ABC4 Utah reported.

'St George has been notorious for a long time not allowing dancing.

'They told me I had to be very careful how I handle it and when I go in and tell people, because if they dance or they get upset with the cops - I would get charged with a felony and thrown in jail for inciting a riot.

'Because it was being done on private property at Fiesta Fun, to our knowledge and experience, we did not need to have any kind of special event permit.'

This week residents addressed the St George City Council, before staging a demonstration on the steps of the city hall. Dozens of people danced to the title track of the Bacon movie, Kenny Loggins' Footloose, as well as the Beastie Boys' (You Gotta) Fight for Your Right (To Party) and Men Without Hats' The Safety Dance, theSt. George News reported.

Tiffany Barnes told the council their permit laws were 'not right'.

'We have a right to dance. Anyone with common sense can recognize this is a frivolous ordinance,' she said.

The law requires anyone hosting a special event must submit for a permit 30 days prior and specify whether or not there will be dancing.

Council bosses say this is to ensure organizers have adequate plans in place for things such as parking and traffic.
