Eco option: Carpenter Joost Taylor poses with his £200 tree made from Scandinavian redwood

It may not have quite the romantic appeal of a traditional Christmas tree, but carpenter Joost Taylor is convinced his wooden alternative is the answer in an eco-friendly age.

With millions of real Christmas trees discarded after the festivities, he has come up with the Timbatree - an invention he claims keeps both the conservationists and the family happy.

And in his first Christmas working from a shed in South Nutfield, Surrey, the 34-year-old former economics graduate appears to have tapped into a growing market.

Orders have come in from all over Europe, the Philippines and Australia as well as British homes and businesses who want a green rather than a white Christmas.

He says his trees are fun, free of pine needles and kinder to the forests, with the wood for his creations being sourced from protected redwood forests in Scandinavia.

'Of the eight million traditional Christmas trees in the UK only around two million ever get recycled. I thought that was a dreadful waste.

'With wooden trees its kinder to pets who tend to eat pine needles, its better for the environment and easier to put up the decorations.

'I hope they are how Christmas trees will look in the future,' he added.

His designs are not cheap with the most expensive costing more than £200 but he claims you get 'a tree for life.'

They range in size from three feet to six feet tall.

He said: 'Demand is growing all the time. I sent out 135 trees last week. More and more people obviously want a green Christmas.'

Alternative: Although it's not green in the traditional sense, the carpenter says his product is a 'tree for life'
