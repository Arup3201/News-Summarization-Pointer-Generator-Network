An ex-fiancée has enthusiastically backed the heartbroken groom-to-be she jilted over Christmas after he chose to sell the chance for a new woman to join him on their honeymoon next month.

John Whitbread, 32, from Donisthorpe, Leicestershire, is auctioning the spare ticket on his £1,950 dream break to the Dominican Republic - and already has offers over £1,100.

His ex-partner Amy Jackson has said she 'didn't feel ready to get married' to him on Valentine's Day this year, but added: 'Fair play to John. I’m pleased that he’s doing something positive'.

Mr Whitbread says he now is looking for a woman of any age with 'a good sense of humour' to join him on the two-week break at an all-inclusive four star resort in the Caribbean. 

He leaves for the Dominican Republic on February 16 and returns on March 3 and hopes he'll have a 'new friend' with him.

Broken hearted: John Whitbread will no longer be getting married  but is auctioning the chance for a new woman to join him on his honeymoon - which has been backed by his ex Amy, together right

Auction: Mr Whitbread has had two bidders so far with the highest offer now at £690 with nine days to go

Mr Whitbread wants a woman who must be an 'easy going down to earth' woman, a British citizen with a passport and 'good looking wouldn't go amiss', he says in his advert.

But he has warned any new companion they would be sharing a room and said: 'I've got no criminal record but should be locked up for my snoring'.

Explaining his decision to sell-off part of his honeymoon to the highest bidder he said: 'I was gutted when she said she didn't want to get married but I realised I couldn't mope forever and I didn't want what I'd already paid to the holiday to go to waste.

'Besides, I think it will be good for me to get away. I'm just looking for a new friend who fancies a holiday with someone fun.'

He claims his girlfriend of two years, Amy, told him she had pre-wedding nerves and could not go through with their wedding due to take place on Valentine's Day this year.

Two days later they were due to head off on their honeymoon.  

His ex-girlfriend Amy said: 'I just didn’t feel ready to get married and John wasn’t my soulmate. Obviously it’s difficult for John, I’m finding it hard too.

'It’s obviously not nice to finish with someone over Christmas but I thought it was better that he knew now, sooner rather than later.

'It was better that I called it off now than getting to the altar and not being able to go through with it.

'Fair play to John. I’m pleased that he’s doing something positive.'

Reaction: Mr Whitbread said he was sad about his break-up but wasn't willing to 'mope' and wanted to enjoy his holiday

Positive: His ex Amy says she is pleased that Mr Whitbread is trying to get on with his life after they split

But when he tried to cancel their holiday the Co-op said he would only be able to claim half the cost back so he decided to keep the holiday and advertise for a new companion to join him.

With the help of his best friend Craig Gibson, he set up an eBay auction to find someone to travel with him and the top bid now stands at £51.

John describes himself as a slim, 5'9, with dark hair who enjoys a good laugh.

His advert reads: 'I'm not boring, I'm adventurous otherwise I wouldn't be doing something as ridiculous as this'. 

Although the couple had been engaged for a year and due to marry in just five weeks' time on Valentine's Day, John says he harbours no bitterness to his ex-fiancee.

Plea: The jilted boyfriend said there is  nothing 'sinister' about his plan and is looking for a 'new friend' to join him on his trip of a lifetime

He said: 'I'm just really glad she told me before we went through with the vows on our big day - I suppose I've got to respect her honesty.

'But I'm certainly not going to let the money or the opportunity pass me by.

'When I found out at the travel agent I could only get half my money back I was looking at other deals and places I could go but I thought, 'No, I wanted to go on this holiday'.

'I called my best friend and he agreed so I headed straight to his house to make the ebay page.

'Everyone I know is taken and I'd rather go and enjoy it with someone new that I'd never otherwise get to meet.

'I'm not looking for a relationship - this could be an opportunity for someone who has never had the chance to take a holiday like this before.

'I'm not looking for anything apart from a fun holiday. If the girl is sporty and wants to do some scuba diving with me that would be great too.

'I really thought that I would only get about £100 on ebay - enough to pay the £50 name change fee and a bit of spending money.

'I can't believe how well it was going. So if you're up for a laugh and fancy a fantastic holiday - let me know!'

Prize: The winning bidder, as long as it is a woman, will get to spend two weeks with John here at the Blue Bay Villas Hotel in the Dominican Republic

After being overwhelmed with the response, John has pledged to donate any money over £1,050 to testicular cancer research.

He added: 'People have said I've got real balls to do this so I thought I might as well try and make some money for charity if I can to.' 

The flight leaves Manchester for Peurto Plata on Monday, February 16 at 9.45 and arrives back at 05.35 on March 3, 2015.

Accommodation is four 14 nights at the four star Blue Bay Villas in Playa Dorado and interested bidders can find the ebay auction HERE
