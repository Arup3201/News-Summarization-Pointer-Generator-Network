Dirty Dancing may have been released 20 years before he was born, but it seems to have inspired one boy to learn the moves that made Patrick Swayze a Hollywood heartthrob.

Charlie, an 8-year-old from Knoxville, Tennessee, saw the classic '80s film with his mother over the summer, and he soon became hooked.

And after 10 more viewings, he managed to learn those iconic dance moves.

Fancy Footwork: Charlie (above), an 8-year-old from Knoxville, Tennessee, has learned all of Patrick Swayze's dance moves from the movie Dirty Dancing

Big fan: The young boy (above) fell in love with the movie after seeing it over the summer

Practice makes perfect:  Charlie's mother, Lanine Kristina, posted a video of Charlie dancing to Facebook, and it has received 9 million views already

Now if only we could find him a female partner to make this already amazing video a little more awesome.

'It is one of my favorite movies and they were showing it at a historic theater in Knoxville this past August and my husband and I went to see it,' Charlie's mother, Lainie Kristina, told Buzzfeed.

'Since the movie had the name "dancing" in it Charlie insisted on watching it the next day at home.'

And watch it he did, learning the dance moves so well his mother decided to film Charlie doing his thing, and post it to Facebook. 

The video now has almost 9 million views, and has gotten so big that Charlie will be showing off his footwork tomorrow morning on Today.

Early start: Charlie began dancing when he was 3-years-old after watching some Michael Jackson videos, soon learning the dance to Thriller (above)

He's a natural: 'He hasn't stopped performing since then,' says Charlie's mother of her son's early start

Charlie's mom says his desire to dance came when he started watching Michael Jackson videos after the singer's death when he was 3, and quickly began imitating his moves.

The family first posted a video of Charlie dancing when he was 4, showing the youngster as he danced to Thriller in his Halloween costume.'

'He hasn't stopped performing since then,' says his mother.

Here's hoping he never does.
