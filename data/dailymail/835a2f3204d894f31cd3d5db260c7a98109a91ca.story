Vote: David Cameron, pictured with wife Samantha at the Cornbury music festival at the weekend, could hold a referendum on Britain's future in the EU
-

David Cameron could hold a referendum on Britain’s future in the EU on the same day as the next general election in 2015 under an explosive plan being hatched by senior Conservatives.

The Prime Minister yesterday opened the door to giving people their first say on Britain’s membership of Europe since 1975, although he insisted now was not the time for such a vote.

Mr Cameron said he agreed with the ‘vast majority of the British people’ who were not happy with the UK’s relationship with the EU.

Critics said his ‘definitely, maybe’ stance on a referendum was too vague to convince voters and appeared chiefly designed to appease Conservative MPs, who have been agitating for a referendum.

But Mr Cameron said ‘tactical and strategic patience’ was required, insisting an immediate ‘in/out’ vote while Europe was in a state of flux and uncertainty was not what most people wanted.

He intends to spell out this autumn a swathe of areas where he wants powers returned from Brussels to Westminster, including home affairs, employment law and social issues.

Some senior Tories suggest he could later announce a referendum in which voters would be asked to endorse a looser relationship with the EU to coincide with the next general election.

Although the Liberal Democrats would be likely to walk out of the Coalition, they suggest Mr Cameron could run a minority Conservative government for the last few months of the Parliament.

Such a dramatic move could energise Conservative support on election day, helping to deliver the party a Commons majority, in the same way as last year’s AV referendum, which was held on the same day as local elections.

Alternatively, the Prime Minister could include a pledge to hold a referendum in the next Tory election manifesto.

But his admission that it is not yet clear when such a referendum might be held, or precisely what it should decide, drew scorn from Labour and some in his own party.

The Prime Minister has received a letter signed by 100 Conservative MPs, who say the Government must legislate before 2015 to convince voters that it is serious about holding a referendum after the election.

Downing Street sources insisted his remarks were necessarily open-ended, since it is not clear what sort of EU will emerge from the debt crisis engulfing the Continent.

Breaking up is hard to do: The referendum would be the first time to question of Europe has been put to the public since 1975, when voters backed the Britain's continuing membership of the bloc

In a Sunday newspaper article, Mr Cameron acknowledged the need to ensure the UK’s position within an evolving EU has ‘the full-hearted support of the British people’.

He said: ‘There is more to come – further moves, probably further treaties – where we can take forward our interests, safeguard the single market and stay out of a federal Europe.

‘As we get closer to the end point we will need to consider how best to get the full-hearted support of the British people, whether it is in a general election or a referendum. For me the two words “Europe” and “referendum” can go together, particularly if we really are proposing a change in how our country is governed, but let us get the people a real choice first.’

The Prime Minister said there were significant areas where EU powers over Britain should be handed back.

‘Put simply, for those of us outside the eurozone, far from being too little Europe, there is too much of it,’ he said. ‘Too much cost, too much bureaucracy, too much meddling in issues that belong to nation states or civil society or, indeed, individuals.

‘Whole swathes of legislation covering social issues, working time and home affairs should, in my view, be scrapped.’

Foreign Secretary William Hague said there would be a ‘very, very powerful’ case for a referendum if Europe moved towards a more federal system, as expected in response to the eurozone crisis.

But he said on the BBC’s Andrew Marr Show that the Government wanted to see whether it could negotiate a better relationship between the UK and Brussels, with the return of powers, before putting the matter to the British people.

But Tory MP Mark Pritchard, a longstanding critic of Mr Cameron over Europe, said: ‘Once again, when it comes to Europe, it is always “jam tomorrow”. But tomorrow never comes. The PM should get an Olympic sailing gold for tacking.’

John Baron, another Conservative backbencher, said: ‘This does not go far enough, it falls short of what is required.

‘We have had too many vague commitments and promises in the past. There is a huge credibility gap – the public don’t trust politicians any more – and that is why we need a legally-binding commitment to hold a vote after the next election.’

Lib Dem sources made clear the party would not countenance a referendum while it was in power with the Conservatives – even though it was the only party to suggest an ‘in/out’ vote in its last election manifesto.

Business Secretary Vince Cable said talk of an EU referendum was ‘horribly irrelevant’ with the Continent in the grip of economic crisis.
