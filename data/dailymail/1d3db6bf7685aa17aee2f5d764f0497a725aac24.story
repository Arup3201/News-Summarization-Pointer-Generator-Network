A man who brutally raped and strangled a 16-year-old classmate 24 years ago has been released from prison amid protests from the girl's family.

Conrad Engweiler, who murdered cancer survivor Erin Tonna Reynolds in Beaverton, Oregon in February 1990, left the Oregon State Correctional Institution at 4.45am on Thursday.

Asked what he planned to do now, he said: 'Just do good. Do good. Give back to the community.'

But Erin's family said they believe the 40-year-old is still a danger to the community. He has returned to Deschutes County, near to where his father lives.

Free: Conrad Engweiler, pictured in May, has been released after serving 24 years behind bars for the brutal rape and strangulation of a classmate he had briefly dated in 1990. He said he wants to 'do good'

'He's still the exact same person he was at 15 years old when he murdered her,' Beth Greear, Erin's sister, told KPTV. 'He's a cold-blooded killer. It's not like he accidentally hit her with a car.'

Engweiler has served 24 years and eight months behind bars after being convicted of the aggravated murder, rape and sodomy of Erin when he was just 15.

He was sentenced to life but avoided the death penalty because he was a juvenile.

He was one of the 'Oregon Five' men convicted of aggravated murder as teenagers in the 1990s before a new measure established mandatory minimum sentences for major crimes, KATU reported.  

Victim: Erin Reynolds, 16, had gone on a few dates with Engweiler before ending their relationship

The Oregon parole board called his crimes 'heinous' but said it was forced to follow rules in effect at the time of the killing.

The  board ruled to free him following two hearings in May and August this year.

In May, he said that his prison time has taught him remorse, empathy and compassion. 

Before approving his release, the board had ordered three separate psychological evaluations.

For the next three years, he will be under the supervision of Deschutes County Adult Parole & Probation.

He is required to register as a sex offender and cannot have contact with Erin's family.

He is also banned from having contact with anyone under the age of 18 without prior written consent and cannot go near a school, childcare center, or place where people under 18s gather.  

Erin Reynolds was found murdered outside buried in a pile of trash outside Engweiler's father's home on February 22, 1990 - just days after she had learned she had beat cancer.

She had been reported missing by her parents the evening before when she missed her curfew.

The following morning, Engweiler's father called cops after he reported his son missing and said that strange car was parked outside his home. 

Denial: Engweiler, pictured in court as a teenager, long blamed the rape and murder on drugs he had taken

The car was identified as Erin's and while officers inspected the home, dogs began barking in the back yard. Drag marks to a ravine led investigators to the 16-year-old's body under debris.

Engweiler was later found hiding out at the home of his mother's attorney and was taken into custody.

The teenagers, who had met when they were both students at Sunset High School, had been on a few dates but Miss Reynolds had ended the relationship.

At the time of his conviction, Engweiler told the court that he had was under the influence of LSD and marijuana when he killed the girl.
