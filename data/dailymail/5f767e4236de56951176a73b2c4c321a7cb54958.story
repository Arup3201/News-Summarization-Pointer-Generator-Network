A Norwegian Air flight heading to Denmark to Norway has been forced to land in Sweden after a passenger claimed to have placed a bomb on board the plane

The Boeing 737 was on its way to Oslo from Copenhagen on Friday afternoon when it made an emergency landing in Gothenburg, south east Sweden.

It has now been confirmed that all passengers have been allowed to leave, but police have ordered a 1,000 metre (3,300ft) safety distance while they wait for a specialist bomb team to arrive.

The plane had taken off from Kastrup when a man told staff on the plane that he had hidden a bomb in the cargo hold, police told Aftonbladet.

After the threat  was made, the Norwegian Air flight made an emergency landing at Landvetter airport in Gothenburg around 3.30pm GMT.

At 4pm GMT, police confirmed that the man who has made the threat is 'secured' and had been removed from the plane in handcuffs.

Air traffic to and from Landvetter airport was temporarily suspended, but is now back to normal since the affected Boeing has been moved, airport management confirms.

‘It is a man who has said that he put a bomb in the cargo hold,’ Björ Blixter at Gothenburg Police said.

‘The plane has just landed and we are investigating.'

The
 Swedish Flight Safety Authority confirmed that a threat had been made 
on the plane and that the plane had landed this afternoon.

This follows the dramatic events in 
Bali earlier today when a Virgin plane was forced to make an emergency 
landing after an Australian man attempted to enter the cockpit.

Matt Christopher Lockley, 28, was arrested by Indonesian police when the plane touched down on Denpasar airport.

Lockley
 is accused of hammering on the cockpit door, forcing the pilot to send a
 mayday message that he feared the plane was being hijacked.
