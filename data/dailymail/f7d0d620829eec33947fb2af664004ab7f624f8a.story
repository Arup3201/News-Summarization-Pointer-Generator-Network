We've heard of people going to long lengths to hide the fact they're planning to propose but this takes the biscuit. 

Parisian born Peter Ntephe, 48, spent weeks tricking his unsuspecting girlfriend Marie Akendengue, 33, into thinking she had a big job interview coming up to hide the fact that he was planning on asking her to marry him.

Sneaky Peter set up the elaborate scheme convincing Marie that she was set to meet with a potential new business partner at The Gherkin, London.

She said yes! Peter and Marie look happy at The Gherkin in London after his surprise proposal was a success

He even encouraged her to spend weeks preparing for the bogus meeting, helping her rehearse her questions, all the while she was total unaware that it would turn out to be the biggest day of her life. 

When the day of the meeting came the interviewer, played by an actor, started off with questions about Marie’s company MAK Petroleum before moving on to some more personal questions.

Marie was quizzed about her taste in music, views on long distance relationships and how she feels about ‘talking to strange men on planes’ - which is how she met Peter.

Before she was left alone to watch a short presentation - unaware it was a slideshow put together by Peter of their journey together.

Marie was tricked into thinking she was having a job interview but Peter was secretly waiting ready to pop the question

As Marie was shown a power-point presentation that had been set up by Peter, she began to twig that something might be up with her 'business meeting'

With the help of The Proposers Peter manged to completely take Marie by surprise, even reducing her to tears with his romantiscism

The Proposers team waited nervously outside the door to see whether Marie would say yes to Peter's proposal

And hopeless romantic Peter was the next surprise as he burst into the room bearing flowers and a diamond engagement band before popping the all important question - and luckily, despite Peter's trickery, she said yes. 

Midway through the 'interview' Peter burst in clutching a bunch of flowers, poor Marie couldn't hide her emotion bursting into tears as he entered the room

Marie was in complete shock as Peter got down on one knee in the middle of the room after spending weeks planning his perfect proposal 

Marie said, 'The interviewer was so serious, I was trying to look for a smile on his face and I was thinking am I the only one who thinks the questions are weird?

'As soon as the guy asked me about long distance relationships I knew something was not quite right.

'Now I know that is why he had a smile on his face that morning when he went to work. He has put in so much preparation.'

Marie couldn't believe it. The bride to be couldn't stop looking at her new accessory - an engagement ring

Peter and Marie spend a lot of time apart due to travelling commitments for work - so Peter had some help with the romantic gesture from London based company The Proposers.
