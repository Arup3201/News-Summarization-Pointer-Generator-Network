A former Miss Great Britain contestant has appeared in court to plead not guilty to falsely claiming more than £22,000 in benefits.

Rachel Hatton, 28, who became the first single mother to take part in the contest, appeared at Northampton Crown Court yesterday where she denied two charges of fraud by making false representation.

She also denied two allegations of fraud by failing to disclose information in relation to £22,000 worth benefits, allegedly claimed between May 2009 and January 2011.

The glamorous divorcee stands accused of claiming housing benefits, council tax, income support and legal aid while claiming to be a single mother.

It is alleged she was living in a tenanted property with the landlord and co-defendant Nathaniel Simon as 'husband and wife'.

The mother-of-one will stand trial with Mr Simon, 36, who also pleaded not guilty to charges of providing a false tenancy agreement between the two individuals.

He also denied an allegation of failing to disclose that he was in a relationship with Ms Hatton.

The case was adjourned for trial at Northampton Crown Court at a date to be fixed. Both were granted bail.

The former beauty pageant contestant hit the headlines in 2010 after becoming the first divorcee in the contest’s 65-year history to be allowed to compete for the coveted title of Miss Great Britain.

She won the regional title of Miss Warwickshire before going on to compete in the national finals of the contest.

Miss Great Britain began in 1945 in Morecambe as entertainment for holidaymakers, under the title 'Bathing Beauty Queen' - with 18-year-old civil service typist Lydia Reid winning a swimsuit and seven guineas for first place.
