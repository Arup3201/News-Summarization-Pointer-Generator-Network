Heather Thomson has a rare and cruel amalgam of disabilities. She has a mind that is at once child-like and beset by the problems of old age.

Her short-term memory is waning; her ability for cogent thought is declining. She has both learning difficulties and dementia. Yet she is just 34. However, there is one subject on which her clarity of thought is undimmed.

Heather knows she loves her basset hound Bumblebee. And the little dog, in turn, adores her.

Best friend: Bumblebee, a basset hound with a bionic paw, has formed a close attachment with her owner Heather Thomson who suffers from dementia and learning difficulties

But there is something about the bond between Heather and her dog that transcends the normal ties between owner and pet: it does not seem fanciful to suggest Heather and Bumblebee have a special empathy because they are both disabled.

Heather was born with cerebral palsy, and a rare chromosomal abnormality precipitated her decline into senility ten years ago. Her mental deterioration is mirrored by a physical one. She finds it painfully hard to walk. Most of the time she uses a wheelchair.

Bumblebee also has difficulties with locomotion. She was born without a foot on her left front leg. The condition, called ectrodactyly, is particularly irksome for bassets, who have very deep chests and stumpy legs.

So when, in Christmas 2011, Heather wrote her annual letter to Santa, her thoughts were not for herself, but with her new, three-month-old puppy.

Intuitive: Owner Heather Thomson has developed an unshakeable bond with her pet dog, particularly after she rescued Bumblebee from being put down

‘I wrote, “Dear Santa, I would like a new leg and foot for Bumblebee.” I love her very much and I said, “I’d be sad if she has to go to heaven”,’ she remembers.

Santa’s reply? ‘He said he’d do his best, but that he could not promise,’ recalls Heather’s mum Vicky Thomson-Carr.

However, small miracles do occur. Ten months later, vet Noel Fitzpatrick carried out ground-breaking surgery on her at his Surrey animal hospital, making her the world’s first bionic dog, with a new shoulder and foot.

The surgery, charged at cost, came to £10,000, half of which was paid for with donations to the ‘Bumblebee fund’ that Vicky set up.

A fter eight weeks in intensive care, last January Heather and Bumblebee were reunited. It was  a day neither Vicky nor Noel will ever forget. 

‘Heather sat on the floor in one of 
the consulting rooms,’ remembers Vicky. ‘We could hear the bump, bump of
Bumblebee’s temporary new foot on the floor in the passage, then she 
bounded in. She went straight to Heather and licked her nose, and she 
was absolutely euphoric.’

Noel,
too, felt vindicated. He’d wrestled with the ethical dilemma of whether
it was right to put a dog through such major surgery.

When he saw Heather’s delight, he knew 
he’d made the correct decision: ‘When I brought Bumblebee in with her 
new foot, Heather laughed out loud.

‘She threw her arms round me, and those moments are what I live for. I got unbelievable happiness from seeing this dog running round, without pain, and Heather’s utter joy.’

Noel’s operation was pioneering and unique. Although joint replacements and prosthetic limbs are relatively commonplace in veterinary science, the surgery on Bumblebee broke new ground because she does not have a false leg strapped on to a stump.

Instead, her foot is attached to a permanent metal peg in the bone of her lower leg. ‘Dogs find it difficult to cope with prosthetics,’ explains Noel. ‘They tend to chew them. And bassets find it particularly hard to walk on them.’

Ground-breaking: Heather made sure that Bumblebee had the first operation of its kind in Britain so that Bumblebee could walk about properly

Bumblebee is far more than a pet to Heather. She is her constant companion and her best friend. She has changed her life, irrevocably, for the better.

Heather is the eldest of divorcee Vicky’s six children, the youngest of whom is 21. Vicky, 54, has raised Heather as a single mum for 23 years and lives with her in an adapted bungalow in Grundisburgh, near Woodbridge, Suffolk.

Once a clerical officer and manager of a dog-training centre, Vicky is now her daughter’s full-time carer. Heather needs help to wash, dress and feed herself. She was, says her mum, a happy young woman until the onset of dementia, when she was 24. ‘One day Heather started talking about events from her childhood, but couldn’t recall what she’d had for breakfast,’ says Vicky.

Special wish: Heather had sent a letter to Father Christmas wishing for Bumblebee to have a new foot and her dream came true

Specialists carried out a battery of tests. To compound her learning difficulties — Heather has the mental age of a seven-year-old — it emerged she also had a chromosomal abnormality leading to frontal lobe dementia.

The condition led to depression and a disturbing bout of self-harming.

‘Heather ripped out clumps of her hair; her scalp bled. She bruised herself by twisting her skin. She destroyed her fingernails,’ says Vicky. ‘It was heartbreaking to see my sweet-natured daughter sink into this state. She was not engaging with anyone.’

It was at this nadir that Vicky decided to breed a litter of pups from the family’s beloved basset Daisy. Two pups were born: the first, Florence, was robust and energetic and became pet to Vicky’s son Ben, 21. The other was Bumblebee — with her bad foot. ‘I asked our local vet if we should put her to sleep, but he said to take things one week at a time,’ says Vicky.

Difficult start: Bumblebee was born without a foot but a local vet made her a bionic one, half of which was paid for by charitable donations to the 'Bumblebee fund'

The puppy developed an intuitive bond with Heather. It was as if they sensed each other’s frailties. ‘Bumblebee is quiet and gentle. She knew she should be careful with Heather. They became inseparable,’ says Vicky. ‘She’d lie against Heather’s chest, follow her up to bed. Wherever Heather was, there was Bumblebee.’

Soon, Heather became smiley again. But as Bumblebee grew, the problem with her leg was magnified. Before Christmas 2011, the family went to see vet Noel, 45, owner of Fitzpatrick Referrals, a specialist centre in Eashing, near Godalming, Surrey. ‘He said we had three options: to put Bumblebee to sleep, to have her leg removed, or to see if an operation might be possible when she was more developed.’

Heather, meanwhile, had written to Santa, and Vicky was terrified of losing the pet who’d transformed her. ‘I explained Bumblebee might have to go to heaven if Noel couldn’t fix her. Heather understood, but I knew she’d be utterly distraught.’

Pioneering: The vet who operated on Bumblebee hopes that many more dogs can benefit from the cutting edge new bionic leg

Of course, Heather’s Christmas wish came true and now Noel believes the procedure will be commonplace in the next decade or so. And Heather and Bumblebee are happily getting on with their lives.

‘They have a special empathy,’ says Vicky. ‘When Bumblebee was tiny, Heather saw this helpless little creature and held her so gently.

‘Heather’s eyes used to be so frightened — a symptom of her dementia. Now she looks content. And tests have shown her condition is improving.’

She adds: ‘The changes to her have been quite miraculous. And it’s all thanks to one small dog.’
