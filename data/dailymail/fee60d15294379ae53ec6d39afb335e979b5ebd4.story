The average British holiday in 2015 will be a couple's sunshine break to Spain, taken out of season, in a hotel with a healthy spending budget to enjoy once we're there.

A survey of over 2,000 UK adults by Monarch Airlines revealed that over half of all breaks booked for 2015 are for trips to sunny Spain – more than three times as many as its closest rival destination, Greece which took second spot with 17 per cent.

An astounding two thirds of holidays in 2015 will be taken by couples, well ahead of the 21 per cent of bookings made groups of friends, and family holidays with the children, which account for 19 per cent of this year's planned breaks.

Spain is set to be the most popular 2015 holiday destination according to research carried out by Monarch

Ian Chambers, head of retail and online at Monarch Airlines said: 'This research into 2015's holiday plans show that our customers will be enjoying some seriously relaxing breaks this year.

'Spain's popularity amongst those looking for sun, sea and sangria is as strong as ever, and with Greece being the second most popular destination for 2015 it's no wonder that our new Greek routes are in high demand.

'It's also great to see savvy travellers making the most of the exceptional bargains that are to be had outside of the traditional peak season – June is a month that offers the excellent weather conditions of high summer without the crowds.

1) Spain – 58.3%

2) Greece – 17.2%

3) Portugal – 16.1%

4) Americas – 13.8%

5) Italy – 12.5%

6) Turkey – 12.2%

7) Cyprus – 11.7%

8) France – 9.1%

9) Egypt – 6.4%

10) Croatia – 5.3%

'However as our research shows, more people are seizing the opportunity and those looking to secure one this year need to act fast to make sure they're not left behind.'

The most popular months for travel are outside of the school summer holidays, with almost half of those surveyed (45 per cent) booking a break in September, followed closely by getaways in May (32 per cent) and June (31 per cent).

Only one in five of those polled were planning to travel in the traditional peak season of July or August.

The appeal of a real break complete with room service and housekeeping is just too strong for most Brits, with over two thirds of holidaymakers booking hotel accommodation over a villa or apartment.

The nation's holidaymakers are also keen to ensure they're able to make the most of their hard earned break – the most popular amount of spending money to take on holiday is a sizeable £400-£500 per person, with a lucky 12 per cent taking over £1,000 as holiday spends.

Many couples have decided Spain will be the choice for them on holiday in 2015
