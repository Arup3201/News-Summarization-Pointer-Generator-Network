A husband and wife paramedic team are mourning the loss of their unborn child after an attack by a patient caused the mother to miscarry.

Joanna and 
Timothy Hickerson, who work in Oklahoma City, had been looking forward to having their baby, and had shared pictures of their ultrasound scan image with friends and family on Facebook.

But a month later, a blow to the stomach by a man who they were treating in an ambulance resulted in a miscarriage - marking the fourth homicide in the city this year.

Victims: Joanna and Timothy Hickerson, a husband and wife paramedic 
team, are mourning the loss of their unborn child after an attack by
an out of control patient

Scene: The couple rushed to this Oklahoma City pharmacy after a call from Ronald Heatly, who was described in court reports as 'agitated'

The couple were called by the man - Ronald Heatly - to the Walgreens pharmacy in NW 23rd and May Avenue.

When they arrived, they asked him to leave the store and invited him into the ambulance, where they hooked him to an IV drip.

Court documents show he was 'acting very paranoid, was dehydrated 
and was HIV positive'.

Agitated: Ronald Heatly could face prosecution after his actions caused the miscarriage of a pregnant paramedic who was treating him

In the ambulance, he was described as 'agitated' and 
started 'swinging his legs and arms around' at the pregnant paramedic, 'striking 
her in the stomach'.

Police Master Sgt Gary Knight, of the Oklahoma City Police Department, told News9: 'They showed up and were trying to help 
somebody, and as a result, unfortunately ended up losing their child.'

The District Attorney's office is still deciding whether to press charges.

Heatly was initially booked into jail for misdemeanor assault charges, but has since been released.

His old apartment is now empty after he was evicted.

Neighbours to the property say they remember Heatly as 'weird'.

One apartment worker, who asked not to be named, said: 'There was a lot of stuff he would say, like he was best friends with Mariah 
Carey and worked for Ellen Degeneres.'

'He was really paranoid. He thought someone was after 
him.'
