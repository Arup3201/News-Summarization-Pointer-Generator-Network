A bartender has claimed she was fired after reporting to police that a regular patron had got into his car and driven away drunk.

Twyla DeVito, from Shelby, Ohio, was praised by police for the act which they said was the right thing to do.

But according to DeVito she lost her job at the American Legion Post bar for reporting the man, who is a board member of the American Legion.

Bartender Twyla DeVito claims she was fired over what local police in Ohio say was the right thing to do

She told ABC News: 'There was no cab, I couldn’t give him a ride home and I was working.'

Shelby Police Chief Charles Roub said officers found the patron driving with a blood alcohol level more than twice the legal limit.

He was issued a citation for operating a vehicle under the influence, according to a police report.

Two days later, DeVito received a call from her commander telling her she was fired.

'He called me and said that I was bad for business,' she said. '[He said], "This is nothing personal, this is all business, but I am going to have to fire you."

'My commander said I didn’t follow protocol, but there was no protocol,' she added.

ABC News tried to reach the American Legion Post in Shelby, Ohio, for comment by telephone was unsuccessful.

According to the Ohio Department of Public Safety, there is not a law that requires a bartender to report a drunk driver.

Roub said: 'I support what she did. We encourage people to report crimes, we encourage people to report drunk driving and, as a police officer, that helps me do my job.'

DeVito said she does not regret calling police.

'If he had gotten in a wreck that would have been on me, because I was on my shift,' said DeVito. 'It was in a lose-lose situation. I choose to possibly save a life.

'I just want people to understand [that] bartenders are in a catch 22,' DeVito said.

'I can cut you off but you are still getting in your car and you’re still drunk. The whole point is being missed. You are still in a car drunk and driving.'
