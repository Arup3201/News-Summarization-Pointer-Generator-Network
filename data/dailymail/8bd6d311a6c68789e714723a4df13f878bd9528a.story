The mesmerising time-lapse video shows 24 hours in the life of the Panama Canal, as traffic passes through the world's most famous waterway. 

The incredible footage was shot over a day at the Miraflores locks, at the Pacific entrance of the canal, where water is drained and filled before ships can go through.

Posted on YouTube by user ZipCam, the video shows vessels going in and out the steel gates of Miraflores locks, which were considered one of the world’s greatest engineering projects. 

The 48-mile Panama Canal, which joins the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans, opened for business 100 years ago and remains a technological marvel to today, having changed world trade forever. 

The footage shows the leaves of the gate, each which weigh 672 tonnes, swing open to let ships through. They are moved by a pair of 25-horsepower motors.

The footage starts in the early hours of the morning, when lights glisten across the surface of the water and the ships travel from the Pacific towards the Atlantic.

Ships travelling in both directions of the Panama Canal. The leaves of the gate, each which weigh 672 tonnes, swing open to let ships through

As the shadows lengthen, the ships travel in the opposite direction, heading from the Atlantic towards the Pacific. 

Containers, cargo and cruise ships all make the journey. 

The video also shows ships travelling in both directions at the same time, with water levels rising and falling on the left and right lanes of the canal. 

The video was taken over the course of a day and starts in the early hours of the morning
