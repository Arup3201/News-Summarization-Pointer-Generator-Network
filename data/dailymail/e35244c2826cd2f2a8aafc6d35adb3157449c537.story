A father is fighting for his life in a coma after he fell from the roof of a moving van during a dangerous ‘car surfing’ stunt.

Ben Dunbar, 26, from Lancing, East Sussex, suffered severe head injuries after being thrown from a Volkswagen Transporter as he tried to ride on top of it.

Witnesses described seeing Mr 
Dunbar standing on the roof of the vehicle before he fell near Bramley Road in Worthing, East Sussex, and was taken to 
hospital by helicopter on Sunday night.

Father Ben Dunbar, 26, is fighting for his life in hospital after being critically injured in a 'car surfing' stunt in Worthing, Sussex. A 27-year-old man has been arrested on suspicion of drink-driving following the incident

The van’s driver, a 27-year-old man from Goring, East Sussex, was arrested at the scene on suspicion of drink-driving, driving without due care and causing serious injury by dangerous driving.

He was later bailed until June 24 pending further inquiries.

The accident took place outside Mr Dunbar's aunt and uncle’s home. His uncle was said to have been one of the first people on the scene.

He realised it was his nephew when paramedics cut off his clothes to reveal Mr Dunbar’s distinctive tattoos of two pistols on his waist.

A neighbour said: ‘It appears he was hanging on the side of the van when it came round the corner and was flung off.

The dangerous craze - which started in the US - sees people attempting to ride on top of vehicles as they speed through the streets.

It has swept the UK after videos of car surfers went viral online, and has claimed at least three British lives in recent years.

The first recorded UK death was when Andrew Travers, aged 18 years, died after falling from a car in Chesterton, Warwickshire, in June 2007.

Seventeen-year-old Chris Findlay died while car surfing on the Isle of Stronsay in Orkney in May 2008.

The following year, Stuart Barnes, aged 21 years, and 20-year-old Swedish friend Jimmy Nylund were killed instantly after clinging to the luggage rail of a car as it crashed into a tree on the Swedish island of Munso.

‘The driver of the van was the first one to attend to him. He was on his phone.

‘He was lying in the driveway of one of my neighbours.

'The paramedics were working on him for ages - they were working really hard, trying desperately to save him.’

Paramedics spent more than half an hour with Mr Dunbar, before he was flown to Southampton General Hospital by air ambulance. 

Another neighbour in Bramley Road said: ‘It sounds like it might have just been a silly prank that has ended with a young man’s life hanging in the balance.’

Surfing on top of vehicles is a craze which first swept the U.S. before moving to the UK as car surfers posted videos online.

Sussex Police have previously warned against the car surfing craze.

In
 2011, a 17-year-old boy and 21-year-old man were banned from driving 
after being caught on CCTV car surfing in Midhurst, West Sussex.

In
 2009, a 19-year-old girl was seriously injured after car surfing at the
 sports park in Piddinghoe Avenue, Peacehaven, East Sussex.

A
 spokesman for Sussex Police said they were still trying to establish 
why Mr Dunbar was on the roof of the van - but could not rule out car 
surfing as the reason.

Sergeant
 Stewart Goodwin, of the Arundel road policing unit, said: ‘We would 
like to hear from anyone who saw what happened or who may have 
information about exactly where the casualty was prior to being 
injured.’

The 26-year-old was flown by air ambulance to Southampton General Hospital on Sunday night
