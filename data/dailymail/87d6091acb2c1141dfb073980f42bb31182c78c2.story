A tiny pub in Wales has been named as one of the world's best beach bars - beating hotspots in Australia, Florida and the Caribbean.

Ty Coch Inn - Welsh for Red House - looks out onto the Irish Sea and the sands at Porthdinllaen on the North Wales coast instead of tropical rivals across the world.

Regulars were amazed when it was named the third best beach bar on Earth and only pipped by bars in Jamaica and Germany.

Picturesque: The Ty Coch Inn pub in North Wales, has been named the third best beach bar in the world

Riding high: The pub on the Lleyn Peninsula was only beaten by bars in Berlin and Jamaica

Remote: Punters must walk a mile along the beach or sail to reach the Ty Coch Inn

The Ty Coch Inn was rated higher than spots in Ibiza, the Costa del Sol and the South of France.

Pelican Bar, in Negril, Jamaica, was named the world's best beach bar and Badeschiff, on the River Spree in Berlin, came second.

Landlady Briony MacMillan, 61, said: 'I was surprised and thrilled - it's a nice accolade to have.

'To put it on a par with somewhere like Jamaica, you can't go wrong really, but it should be number one.

'We are in a fantastic location, where you can only get to on foot or by boat, we are starting to get very well known worldwide.'

The pub started life as a vicarage in 1823 before being opened as an inn in 1842 to feed hungry and thirsty shipbuilders from the nearby harbour.

Ideal location: The pub sits directly on the sandy beach near Nefyn, North Wales

David and Samantha Cameron visited the Ty Coch for an Easter break where he had a pint of lager and a packet of peanuts

Secret gem: Locals say it is the best pub in the world but do not want others to know about it

Long history: Ty Coch Inn started as a vicarage but became a pub in 1842 to serve thirsty shipbuilders

The Ty Coch is a beachside pub in Porthdinllaen near Morfa Nefyn on the Lleyn Peninsula

Visitors must walk nearly a mile across the beach or cross a golf course on top of headland to reach it.

Pub bosses are expecting more visitors after the list of the world's best beach bars was published.

But the locals aren't looking forward to too many new faces.

One regular Fraser Bardsley, 57, said: 'We think it's the best in the world. We don't want people to know about it.'

The list was compiled by holiday company Cheapflights taking into account 'vibe, location and individuality'.

Spokesman Ben Rosier said: 'Who'd have thought that a beach drinking spot in Wales would take on glitzy sun-drenched rivals in Brazil, Ibiza, Florida and the South of France and win?'

The remote pub on the Lleyn peninsula sits in the shadow of the Snowdonia mountains on a site owned by the National Trust.

A spokesman for the organisation said: 'We're not surprised it's made a worldwide top 10 and we're sure that visitors from across the world will get a warm Welsh welcome there.'

It looks a little ramshackle, but Pelican Bar, in Negril, Jamaica, was named the world's best beach bar

With it's floating platforms on the River Spree, Badeschiff, in Berlin, came second on the list
