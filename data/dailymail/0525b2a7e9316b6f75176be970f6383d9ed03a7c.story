Children as young as nine have been treated in hospital for alcohol-related illnesses, it has been revealed.

And hospital emergency specialists have said they have seen a 'worrying' trend of an increase in young girls drinking.

Figures from Lancashire Teaching Hospitals revealed during 2012/13 a total of 60 teenagers aged between 13 and 15 attended the emergency department with alcohol-related conditions.

The information, obtained under the Freedom of Information Act, also reveals that during 2008/09, at least one child aged nine attended the emergency department and was admitted to a hospital ward due to alcohol related reasons.

And in the past 12 months, children as young as 11 and 12 have been treated in A&E or admitted to a hospital ward as a result of drinking too much.

Hospital staff have revealed that they tend to see more under-age drinking in young girls than in boys and expressed their concern at youngsters putting themselves in vulnerable situations.

Lynne Sime, acting matron of emergency medicine at Royal Preston Hospital, said: 'We have seen children as young as nine come into the emergency department as a result of alcohol and also a number of 11 and 12-year-olds.

'However, the majority of underage drinkers who end up in hospital tend to be 13 to 16-year-olds.

'With the young children, it is usually the case that they have a friend who is a bit older who has given them alcohol.

'Because they are younger, they do not metabolise alcohol as quickly as teenagers or adults, so it stays in their system and they become intoxicated and the affects of the alcohol are more pronounced.

'The worrying thing is that we are seeing a trend where there is more underage drinking in young girls. This is a concern as they are putting themselves in vulnerable positions because they do not know what is happening.'

The statistics for Lancashire Teaching Hospitals show that during 2012/13, 27 15-year-olds attended the emergency department with alcohol related conditions, 20 14-year-olds and eight 13-year-olds.

'We usually get more cases in the summer
months when children break up from school and meet up in the holidays 
with their friends in the park'

There was also at least one 12-year-old and one 11-year-old attending A&E with alcohol problems, but the trust refused to reveal exact numbers.

The affected young people were either treated and discharged from the emergency department or treated there and then admitted to a hospital bed.

Lancashire Teaching Hospitals Trust, which runs the Royal Preston and Chorley and South Ribble Hospitals, works in partnership with Young Addiction and Discover Drug and Alcohol Services. Clinics are held weekly in the emergency department for patients who have been referred.

The trust is also introducing a hospital alcohol liaison nurse at the end of this month who will be employed by the trust.

Ms Sime said: 'We do get the odd accidental case where a child has drunk alcohol by mistake, but the majority of underage alcohol cases that we see are young people experimenting with alcohol with their older friends as a result of peer pressure.

'We usually get more cases in the summer months when children break up from school and meet up in the holidays with their friends in the park.

'When they come into hospital, we assess them and if they are intoxicated, they get a dedicated nurse to look after them. We give them IV fluids to help their alcohol absorption.

'We do not judge them as our role is to look after them. At the end of the day, they are children and it is all a learning curve.

'We treat them with compassion and understanding. A lot of them are mortified and distraught at being in the situation.

'However, if we see the same child more than once because of alcohol related issues, we speak to social services.'

A spokesman for Lancashire County Council said: 'It is really important for everyone, especially young people, to remember that drinking above the recommended levels of alcohol can be hazardous to our health in a number of ways.

'Excessive drinking is associated with serious medical conditions such as cirrhosis of the liver and a wide range of digestive disorders. People often forget that heavy drinkers have an increased risk of developing cancer.

'There is also a strong association between alcohol abuse, injury and violent crime, and young people are more likely to put themselves in dangerous situations when they've been drinking to excess.'
