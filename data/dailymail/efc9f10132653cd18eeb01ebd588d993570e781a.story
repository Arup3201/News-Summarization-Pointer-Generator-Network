A single father serving in the Air Force surprised his daughter with a heartwarming early return home on Friday.

Air Force Sgt. Wil Alteus was raising daughter Lyrique in New Jersey when he was called to active duty in August 2013, People reports. Lyrique was sent to live with Alteus' sister Kinley in Florida.

Both Lyrique and Kinley did not know when Sgt. Alteus would return home -- and were shocked when Lyrique received an amazing surprise at school that was captured on video.

Sgt. 
Alteus found out he could return to the United States after serving nine
 months overseas at an undisclosed location in southwest Asia. He then contacted officials at Mount Dora Bible School where Lyrique is a second-grade student to plan the surprise, according to Daily Commercial.

Lyrique was chosen along with two students to play in a trivia game similar to Wheel of Fortune. When all of the letters were chosen, Lyrique read aloud the phrase 'Lyrique's dad is home.'

Overcome with joy, Lyrique is seen in the video running down an aisle to embrace her father standing at the back of the room in uniform.

Alteus' sister Kinley was also present at the big reveal. Sgt. Alteus specially asked the school to have her attend the special day as well.

Now that her father is home, Lyrique 'doesn't want to let him go,' Kinley Alteus told People.Â 

'My brother wanted to make this special for Lyrique because it was so hard leaving her for those months ... it was a huge surprise for both of us!' she also said.

This isn't the first time Sgt. Alteus and the school have worked together to make special memories for Lyrique. In November 2013, the Orlando Sentinel reported that Sgt. Alteus skyped with Lyrique and over 800 staff and students in the school auditorium on Veterans Day.
