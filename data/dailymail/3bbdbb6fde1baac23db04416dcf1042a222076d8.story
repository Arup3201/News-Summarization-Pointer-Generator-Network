Workers rights advocates have called for industrial relations commissioners to spend two weeks in their shoes, amid renewed calls for cuts to penalty rates.

United Voice, a union representing more than 120,000 Australian workers across hospitality, health, aged care and manufacturing industries, has said penalty rates are crucial to the workers it represents.

'When workers talk about penalty rates they talk about economic survival,' United Voice ACT secretary Lyndal Ryan told the Canberra Times.

Australian Hotels Association chief executive Stephen Ferguson said it would be 'ridiculous' if penalty rates were not considered in any workplace relations reform

Ms Ryan's comments come as the union made its submission to the upcoming Productivity Commission review.

The submission called for commissioners to spend two weekends working in industries such as aged care or hospitality, rule out considering income from tips in its findings and to study the economic benefits of penalty rates. 

However, industry representatives have said penalty rates have to be up for discussion if a major review of workplace relations is to take place. 

Australian Hotels Association chief executive Stephen Ferguson said omitting them from the conversation would be 'ridiculous'.

'The current structure of paying 275 per cent [of ordinary wage rates] on these public holidays - our research says this doesn't stack up,' Mr Ferguson said.

'We don't step away from the fact that a Sunday is different from a Monday, for example, all we're talking about is the quantum.'

Mr Ferguson said the AHA's submission to this year's Productivity Commission will be lodged on Monday, and will push for changes that would see unsociable work hours instead called 'additional rates' and make the wages mark-up less generous.

Hospitality worker and United Voice delegate Nicolette Marks said her hourly rate was about one- third higher during night hours but was well earned.

'Working in an industry that has alcohol, we have people at the bar talking to us to 4am, then you have the people who are rude and abuse you,' she said.

'It's kind of like collateral damage pay.'

Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry chief executive Kate Carnell and ACTU president Ged Kearney schedule to debate workplace relations at the National Press Club on Tuesday. 

Employment Minister Eric Abetz has previously said the government will not be interfering with the Fair Work Commission. Treasurer Joe Hockey's  terms of reference for the pending inquiry also did not mention penalty rates. 

Those comments contradicted Prime Minister Tony Abbott, who has said he could seek a mandate for changes to penalty rates at the 2016 election.
