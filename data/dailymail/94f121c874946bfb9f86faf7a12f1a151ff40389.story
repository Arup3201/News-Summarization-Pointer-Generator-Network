A Scottish farmer was faced with the extraordinary sight of his carrots standing upright above the ground after a nearby river burst its banks and washed away the soil around them.

Allan Fearn, 60, went out to check his fields at Redford Farm in Laurenkirk after the North Esk burst its banks, and was worried that his crops might have been badly damaged or washed away.

But he found the vegetables were upright after the soil around them was washed away – only days after the harvester had gone through the field making paths in preparation for the harvest.

Remarkable: Allan Fearn was 'amazed' when he saw that his carrots were standing upright after water from a burst river bank had washed away much of the soil

Once the river burst its banks it 
flowed through the fields on its way to the sea, but fortunately 
followed the path made by the harvester, saving nearly all the carrots.

The only carrots that were washed away were found further down the field, suspended in trees at the bottom of the site.

Mr Fearn said today: ‘We had about 
three inches of rain and the North Esk burst its banks about half a mile
from here. It came right down through the crop of carrots.

'The water just washed away all the 
soil and left the carrots standing. The carrots are about eight or nine 
inches, and only an inch was left in the ground so they just looked to 
be standing on their own.

‘We didn’t think we would be able to harvest them as they would just fall over, but we have.'

Saved: Once the river burst its banks it flowed through the fields on its way to the sea, but fortunately followed the path made by the harvester, saving nearly all the carrots

He added: ‘It’s lucky the river followed the 
paths - it would have been a very different story if it had washed 
through the field. We are very relieved.’

Allan Fearn, farmer

‘I suppose it’s quite a novel way to wash carrots in the field, though I wouldn’t want it to happen again.

‘A few of the carrots were washed away
into the trees at the bottom of the field, they were about five foot 
off the ground, just left dangling there. I have never seen anything 
like this before.’

Mr Fearn set up the farm in 1988 with 
his wife Ann. They now employ 50 people at the site and supply neeps and
carrots to markets across the UK and Europe.
