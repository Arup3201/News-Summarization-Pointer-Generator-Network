A Liberal Democrat MP who has questioned the existence of Israel was suspended from the party yesterday.

David Ward will have the whip withdrawn until Parliament returns in September after branding Israel an 'apartheid state'.

But the punishment - after Mr Ward repeatedly condemned Israel and 'the Jews' more widely - was condemned by Jewish groups as an 'empty gesture' that is 'too little, too late'.

The offensive Tweet was still available to read on David Ward's Twitter feed last night

Lib Dem chief whip Alistair 
Carmichael kicked Mr Ward out yesterday over a Tweet in which the 
Bradford East MP said: 'Am I wrong or are am I right? At long last the 
#Zionists are losing the battle - how long can the #apartheid State of 
#Israel last?'

That 
outburst came after four previous warnings from the party leadership 
that he use 'proportionate and precise' language when discussing Israel.

Mr
 Carmichael said Mr Ward's repeated outbursts had been framed in a way 
that has 'caused offence' and made it more difficult for the Lib Dems to
 make legitimate criticism of Israel's settlement building in 
Palestinian areas.

Mr
 Ward's difficulties with the party leadership began over a posting made
 on his website after signing a memorial book to mark Holocaust Memorial
 Day in January.

Carmichael said Mr Ward's repeated outbursts had been framed in a way 
that has 'caused offence'

He
 wrote that he was 'saddened that the Jews, who suffered unbelievable 
levels of persecution during the Holocaust, could within a few years of 
liberation from the death camps be inflicting atrocities on Palestinians
 in the new state of Israel and continue to do so on a daily basis'.

But despite repeated warnings to tone down his language, Mr Ward refused.

Following a meeting with Lib Dem leader Nick Clegg and his deputy Simon Hughes, Mr Carmichael yesterday wrote to Mr Ward saying: 'We put it to you that your most recent statement - which specifically questions the continuing existence of the State of Israel - is neither proportionate nor precise.

'We considered your explanation to be unconvincing. These interventions cause considerable offence rather than addressing questions of political substance about the plight of the Palestinian people and the right of Israel's citizens to live a life free of violence.

Jonathan Arkush, vice president of the Board of Deputies of British Jews said the suspension is not enough.

He said: 'We note that the Liberal Democrats have at last taken some action to address the completely inappropriate and offensive comments that he has made.

However, suspension of the whip for just two months when Parliament is not sitting is too little, too late. It is a token and frankly an empty gesture.'

Karen Pollock, chief executive of the Holocaust Educational Trust said: 'David Ward has never fully apologised for his comments, which deliberately abused the memory of the Holocaust and caused deep pain and offence.

'Although I welcome the withdrawal of the whip, the decision to do so comes months too late and allows Mr Ward to repeat his unacceptable views when Parliament returns in the autumn.'
