Buying a home in Wales would be cheaper than in England under Tory plans to axe stamp duty on properties worth up to £250,000.

Conservatives in Wales will today announce a policy to axe the 1 per cent levy, warning stamp duty pushes home ownership ‘dream further away’ for thousands of would-be first-time buyers.

The move will heap pressure on Chancellor George Osborne to promise to do the same in England, or risk making it more costly to buy a home on different sides of the border.

Under the plan drawn up by Tories i wales, the cost of buying a home in Wales would be higher than in England in an attempt to attract buyers to cross the border

Mr Osborne has used taxpayers money to guarantee billions of pounds in state-backed mortgages under the controversial Help to Buy scheme, to help people who only have a five per cent deposit to buy a home.

But Tories in Wales want to go further, and propose using new powers devolved to Cardiff to cut stamp duty levied on properties worth between £125,000 and £250,000.

Writing for MailOnline Andrew Davies, Welsh Conservative leader said: ‘For many without the Bank of Mum & Dad or who already pay expensive rents prohibiting saving, the costs of that initial leap onto the ladder remain unreachable.

‘Stamp duty pushes that dream further 
away. On average for a 10 per cent deposit, stamp duty is equivalent to 3
 per cent on top.’

The 
policy to scrap stamp duty in Wales would cost around £20million, but to
 be replicated across England would cost hundreds of millions of pounds.

The move would make it much cheaper for people trying to get their foot on the first run of the property ladder, at a time when values are soaring.

Mr Osborne warned this week that the house price boom would last for another decade, with demand outstripping supply.

House prices in Wales were up by 5.4 per cent in November, 11.6 per cent in London, 4.5 per cent in the South East and 4.4 per cent in the West Midlands

Chancellor George Osborne warned demand for homes would significantly outstrip supply for at least another 10 years

Prices in Wales are up more than 5 per cent, slightly lower than the average in England but well ahead of Scotland, Northern Ireland and the north West of England.

Mr Davies added: ‘We want to make Wales a nation of home owners and a place of low tax and this is just one of the ways we can get there.’

The Tories are the second largest party in the Welsh Assembly, and the policy will almost certainly lead to calls for Labour to follow suit.

When the Conservatives called for a stamp duty ‘holiday’ for first-time buyers before the 2010 election, then-Labour chancellor Alistair Darling quickly copied the policy.

Moves to devolve tax powers to Cardiff make it possible for the first time that stamp duty rates could differ between England and Wales.

The Wales Bill, which would hand control of stamp duty to Assembly members, is expected to pass into law this year.

Andrew Davies, Tory leader in Wales, claims the stamp duty cut could revitalise Wales

The
 property-owning democracy was one of Margaret Thatcher’s lasting 
legacies. In today’s Wales of lower than UK average salaries and 
expensive rental markets; this legacy is becoming less and less of a 
possibility for many.

Last 
year, there were 13,000 house sales in the stamp duty bracket - £125,000
 to £250,000. With house prices on the rise again, houses that fall in 
this bracket are no longer for the wealthy but for our aspirational and 
those wanting to get onto the property ladder.

This dream has become 
more of a reality with the increase in 5 per cent deposit mortgage offers and 
shared equity schemes, following the impressive lead of the UK 
Government. 

However, for many without the Bank of Mum & Dad or who 
already pay expensive rents prohibiting saving, the costs of that 
initial leap onto the ladder remain unreachable.

Stamp duty pushes that 
dream further away. On average for a 10 per cent deposit, stamp duty is 
equivalent to 3 per cent on top. 

Therefore,
 the Welsh Conservatives are today pledging to abolish stamp duty on all
 property in Wales up to a value of £250,000.

We want to make Wales a 
nation of home owners and a place of low tax and this is just one of the
 ways we can get there. We would like to do this today, but we need to 
wait until powers are devolved.

Within
 the next year, the Wales Bill – a UK Government bill which plans to 
devolve stamp duty to the Welsh Assembly – will be passed, enabling 
Wales to become a low tax destination.

Since Welsh devolution began in 
1999, GVA has fallen to 72 per cent of the UK average and average wages and 
house prices lag behind other parts of the UK. All this whilst Labour 
has been at the helm of the Welsh economy for nigh on 15 years.

In some 
areas of Wales, builders are now turning their backs on building here 
because of the cost of Welsh regulations and the lack of buoyancy in the
 market.

It is inevitable 
that some in Wales will query the need for such a move, but that’s part 
of the lack of imagination, not lack of possibility. 

In
 a report written in June last year, it was suggested that reducing 
stamp duty by just 1per cent can increase volumes by 20 per cent over a 
very short period of time.

At present levels, abolishing this band of 
stamp duty would cost the Welsh exchequer around £20 million. However, 
an increase in economic activity will increase tax takes.

The
 UK Government’s announcement to support 30 of the 31 recommendations of
 the Silk Commission on further devolution shows the Conservative 
commitment to Wales being a low tax country as a means to driving 
entrepreneurial spirit and growing a Welsh economy that for too long has
 been at the bottom of the UK’s competitiveness league tables.

Last
 week, a leading report showed significant evidence of ‘brain drain’ to 
London and the South East, with clear routes from all parts of the UK.

Nowhere was the route more trodden than between Wales and London. We all
 know that the UK faces huge challenges in counter-balancing the huge 
pull of London, yet in the case of Wales very few actually return.

This
 requires radical policy and I believe that by sounding the horn of low 
tax, Wales could begin to reverse this decline.

Becoming a place where 
people believe enterprise thrives and is actively supported. I believe 
the Welsh Conservatives are the only party to do that.

What
 an abolition of stamp duty would do is send a message to the strivers 
and the ambitious that they can be better off in Wales. It won’t solve 
all problems, but nor do I pretend it will. Sometimes in politics, small
 changes can make very big differences.
