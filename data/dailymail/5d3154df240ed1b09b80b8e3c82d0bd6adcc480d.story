Ten men have been charged as part of an investigation into child grooming and sexual exploitation in Rochdale against girls as young as 13.

The men are accused of a catalogue of serious sex offences, which include numerous charges of rape and sexual activity with a child, against seven victims between 2005 and 2013.

All 10 have been arrested under Operation Doublet, which aims to tackle child sexual exploitation by older men in Rochdale.

The operation was launched after the conviction of nine men last May for their roles in a child abuse ring which spanned Rochdale and parts of Greater Manchester.

Assistant Chief Constable Ian Wiggett, of Greater Manchester Police, said: 'The majority of the offences were committed between 2003 and 2013 and focus on reports that teenage girls were sexually exploited by older men.

'So far, 65 people have been arrested as part of Operation Doublet and the investigation continues.

'This is an extremely complex and challenging investigation which started in May 2012. The investigation will continue over the coming months and further arrests are anticipated.

'The welfare of the victims is paramount and we have a team of experienced officers supporting them through the process.'

The charges are; Shayfur Rahman, 31, of Prestwich, one count of rape; Kutab Miah, 34, of Rochdale, three counts of sexual activity and one count of rape; Rehan Ali, 26, of Manchester, one count of rape, three counts of sexual activity with a child when the offender was over 18 and three counts of sexual activity with a child when the offender was between 15 and 17.

Iklaq Choudhry Hussain, 37, of Rochdale, three counts of sexual activity with a child and two counts of rape; David Law, 45, of Ilkeston, Derbyshire, three counts of conspiracy to commit rape; Mahfus Rahman, 28, three counts of rape and three counts of sexual activity with a child.

Ashfaq Yousaf, 28, has been charged with one count of aiding and abetting rape against one victim. He has also been charged with one count of rape against a further victim.

Afraz Ahmed, 32, of Rochdale has been charged with two counts of conspiracy to commit rape and one count of rape against one victim. He also faces two counts of inciting a child to engage in sexual activity, relating to offences against to girls. He has also been charged with one count of rape against a further victim.

Ian Wiggett, assistant chief constable at Greater Manchester Police said 65 people have been arrested so far under Operation Doublet 

Mohammed Davood, 37, of Burnley has been charged with one count of assault occasioning actual bodily harm against one victim. He has also been charged with three counts of rape, one count of sexual activity with a child and one count of sexual assault against a further victim.

Mohammed Miah, 39, has been charged with three counts of sexual activity and one count of rape against one victim. He has also been charged with one count of rape against a further victim.

Rochdale MP Simon Danczuk welcomed news of the charges.

He said: 'I welcome today's news that more alleged perpetrators of child abuse are being brought to justice. I have spoken to the Director of Children's Services at Rochdale Council earlier today and have been fully briefed on the developments.'

He added: 'I have been critical of child protection agencies, and especially Greater Manchester Police, in the past regarding their handling of these cases. But credit where credit is due, these arrests demonstrate the progress that has been made.

'We have seen in recent months that Rochdale is far from the only town in the country to have experienced this type of abuse. The difference in Rochdale is that we now have much better systems in place for protecting children and all agencies are working together to catch the perpetrators.

'Finally, it should be recognised that these arrests could not have happened without the incredibly brave actions of survivors of abuse. I know from personal experience just how difficult it is for survivors to speak out about their abuse. So I want to pay tribute to the young women who have suffered this abuse and have worked with police.' 

The Crown Prosecution Service said the majority of alleged offences took place when the complainants were under 16.

Nazir Afzal, chief crown prosecutor, said: 'These defendants now stand charged with serious criminal offences and have the right to a fair trial.

'It is extremely important that there should be no reporting, commentary or sharing of information online which could in any way prejudice these proceedings.'

Two of the men, Ahmed and Law, were remanded in custody when they appeared at Bury Magistrates' Court on February 24.

Choudhry, Rahman, Davood, Ali and Miah will appear at the same court tomorrow and the remaining three defendants will face Tameside Magistrates' Court on Wednesday.
