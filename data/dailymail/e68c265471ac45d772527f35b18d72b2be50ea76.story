An elderly couple endured a seven year 'nightmare' when a council broke its own planning laws and filled a B&B next door to their house with homeless people.

Norman and Mavis Wisbey, from Cambridge, were kept awake by the sounds of shouting, swearing, loud music and fighting emanating from the Green End Guest House, and they said police were frequently called out to disturbances at the property.

The Wisbeys, who likened their ordeal to 'living in a war zone', say Cambridge City Council ignored their complaints for years before finally launching an investigation and apologising to the pensioners.

'Unacceptable': Norman and Mavis Wisbey, pictured with their friend Clare Blair, a former Cambridge City Councillor, described their seven year ordeal as like 'living next to a war zone'

The problem had escalated to the point where the Wisbeys were too scared to leave their home for fear of it being damaged or burgled, and missed out on spending Christmases with their children and grandchildren to stay in the house.

Moving would have meant selling their three-bedroom semi detached home in Cambridge for a fraction of the £300,000 it is worth.

In 2002 the council’s own planners and a planning inspector ruled that only four rooms could be let at the B&B.

Tormented: The couple grew too afraid to leave their house due to the 'barrage of inappropriate behaviour' at the B&B next door

But three years later the authority signed an agreement to place up to nine homeless people there, taking some from other councils' areas.

The Wisbeys are now seeking compensation from the authority after an independent investigation found they had suffered a 'wholly unacceptable level of hostility, aggression and disturbance'.

Police were called to the B&B on average three times a month said retired van driver Norman, 71, and his wife Mavis, a 69-year-old retired laboratory assistance.

They made hundreds of complaints but it was five years before the authority launched a full investigation.

Mrs Wisbey, who suffers from stress as a result of the case, said: 'We saved up for our own home but we were prevented from enjoying it.

'We couldn’t sit in our garden or we would be subjected to a barrage of swearing and inappropriate behaviour.

'It was like living in a war zone sometimes, and someone even committed suicide there in 2011.

'We were constantly on edge wondering who was going to move into the house next. There were nine strangers with various social problems - it was a recipe for trouble.

'It was horrible when mothers and children were in there and all you could hear was shouting.

'They chucked used tampons and condoms into our garden which we had to clean up ourselves.

'We could not sit and have our evening meal in peace - and all you could hear was loud rap music, death threats and every other word was a swear word.'

Mrs Wisbey added: 'The council were flouting their own rules.

'They used the property for their own purposes without consideration for what the neighbours had to put up with.

'No-one should have to put up with what we did these last seven years, you shouldn’t have to live like that.

'The council have a duty to the homeless but they should have thought it through properly.

'They never checked with the planning department that what they were doing followed the rules.'

Mr Wisbey said: 'We were always on edge, never knowing what’s going to happen. We couldn’t lead a normal life in our own home.'

'The owner has made a lot of money at our expense.'

His wife added: 'The council has said the problems started in 2007, but we were making repeated complaints to the police and council from 2005.

'We were never in it for the money, we just wanted a peaceful life. But now we think the council should pay for its cock ups.

'We want the compensation to cover the full time we had to endure this nightmare.

'No-one else should have to endure all that we did over the years.'

Apology: An investigation commissioned by Cambridge City Council indicated the authority had made mistakes including failing to share information across its departments

Mr and Mrs Wisbey say they started 
making complaints about anti-social behaviour at the Green End 
guesthouse back in 2005, but the council maintains it only has records 
from 2007.

Eventually 
in 2010 the council recommended the hostel employ a night manager, but 
the Wisbeys say they failed to keep the place under control.

The landlord applied for ‘lawful development’ in 2012 to use more than four rooms, but planners turned it down.

The
council took no action until Cambridge MP Julian Huppert and former 
city councillor Clare Blair pointed out that their own planning status 
restricted it to four tenants only.

Independent complaints investigator Corinne Hibbert said the Wisbeys had endured a 'wholly unacceptable level of hostility, aggression and disturbance'.

She added: 'I find it extraordinary that the council not only failed to uphold the decision of the planning inspectorate but encouraged use of the property in direct contravention of it.'

She has recommended the council pays the substantial compensation to the couple.

Simon Payne, the council’s environment director, said he had apologised to the couple.

He said: 'The investigation that we commissioned shows we made mistakes, including failing to share relevant information between our own departments.

'We recognise that was unacceptable.'

The B&B which stands next to the Wisbeys is now empty and a spokesman for the property owner claimed complaints had always been acted upon.
