A host of stars from past and present have had their famous faces carved into festive Jack O Lanterns for an annual Halloween festival.

The Rise of the Jack O Lanterns display showcases more than 5,000 elaborately-carved pumpkins, which are available to view at sites in Los Angeles and New York. And while the designs vary from the wicked to the wonderful, it is the celebrity faces which prove the most popular year on year.

Perhaps unsurprisingly, the Kardashian clan feature heavily in this year’s celebration, with Kim, Kourtney, Khloe, Kylie, Kendall, matriarch Kris and even brother Rob receiving the festive treatment ahead of Halloween on Friday.

Old Hollywood: Movie legends such as Marilyn Monroe were also part of the celebrity mix

Old Hollywood greats including Marilyn Monroe, Mickey Rooney and Shirley Temple also feature; as well as a number of musicians from Michael Jackson and Elvis to Shakira and Katy Perry.

The festival also pays tribute to the stars who have passed away in the last year. 

Beloved comedian Robin Williams, who died in August of a suspected suicide, actor Phillip Seymour Hoffman, who died of a drug overdose in February, and comedienne Joan Rivers, who died just last month, are all immortalized in the display.

The origins of Jack o'Lantern carving as a practice are uncertain, but it's a widely held belief that the tradition started in Ireland during the 19th Century.

In an age populated by devout Christians, and when superstitions ran rampant, carved pumpkins were sometimes set on windowsills around All Saints' Day to ward off evil spirits.

Nowadays, pumpkin carving is a tradition firmly woven into the American culture of Halloween, with the average American's spending $66 per person one the occasion, according to the National Retail Federation.
