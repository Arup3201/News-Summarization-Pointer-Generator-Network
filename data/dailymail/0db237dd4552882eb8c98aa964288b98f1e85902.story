Among the messages doing the rounds on social media after Southampton’s defeat at Liverpool on Sunday were a number suggesting that James Ward-Prowse had just earned himself a move to Anfield.

However tongue-in-cheek the comments, they might not have gone down particularly well with those Saints fans still smarting at the way their team has been pillaged by Liverpool boss Brendan Rodgers this summer. Rickie Lambert, Adam Lallana, Dejan Lovren have all departed St Mary’s for Merseyside while Luke Shaw moved to Manchester United for £27million.

There is still plenty of cause for optimism on the South Coast, however. The conveyor belt of young talent that has produced the likes of Gareth Bale, Theo Walcott and Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain in recent years has discovered another gem in Ward-Prowse.

The 19-year-old midfielder’s dead-ball technique and crossing ability has already brought comparisons with David Beckham. He scored his first goal for England Under-21s with a freekick against Lithuania last October and another stunning set-piece against Brazil was voted the best goal at this summer’s Toulon Tournament where Ward-Prowse was also named among the top three players.

At Anfield on Sunday, he enhanced his growing reputation with a succession of impressive dead-ball deliveries in Southampton’s 2-1 defeat to Liverpool. No surprise then that he is already being tipped to follow Lallana and his old friend Shaw into the big-time at both club and international level.

A young man who grew up admiring Beckham’s style was not even born when Ronald Koeman’s freekick for Holland broke England’s hearts and knocked Graham Taylor’ s team out of qualifying for the 1994 World Cup, but he could not be in better hands after the Dutchman replaced Mauricio Pochettino as Southampton boss this summer.

‘I searched things online when we were linked with him and I found some great goals on YouTube,’ said Ward-Prowse, who was used in his preferred central midfield role in Koeman’s first league game rather than wide on the right under Pochettino.

‘I’ve studied videos of Beckham as well and he’s someone I do look to compare myself to in terms of set-piece deliveries. He was a big role model for me, not only on the pitch but off the pitch – the way he applies himself.’

Ward-Prowse insists he has never touched a drop of alcohol and has no interest in the party scene frequented by so many young Premier League footballers.

He joined Saints at the age of eight after turning down their great rivals Portsmouth, his hometown team. James, his father John and older brother Ben were all big Pompey fans.

‘At one stage he was training with Southampton and Pompey five nights a week,’ says John, a barrister. ‘Then the inevitable happened – both clubs found out about the other. But it was always going to be Southampton because of the fantastic reputation of their academy and the quality of the coaching.

‘He flirted with cricket as something to do in the summer and he’s quite a competent tennis player but it’s always been about football for him. The first thing he did was kick. As soon as he could walk he had a ball at his feet and if we took that away from him he would kick his teddy bear!’

Ward-Prowse turned professional at the same time as Shaw and Calum Chambers – who joined Arsenal for £12m this summer – after making his first-team debut in October 2011. Although he made 19 appearances in all competitions following Southampton’s promotion to the Premier League and another 39 last season, many were as a substitute and he is determined to cement a first-team place under Koeman.

The challenge now is to show that he can fill the gap left by Lallana. ‘It’s a massive season, probably the biggest of my career so far,’ said Ward-Prowse. ‘Last season was a bit of a struggle in terms of starts and it would be good to maintain a place throughout the year.

‘They are big shoes to fill and Adam was a fantastic player for the club and a fans’ favourite. Hopefully that is the sort of role I’m looking to take on myself.’

If Ward-Prowse continues at this rate, Saints fans could be waving goodbye to another young star sooner than they had hoped.
