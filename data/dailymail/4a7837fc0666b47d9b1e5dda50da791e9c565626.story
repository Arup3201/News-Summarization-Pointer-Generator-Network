Two menus from the Titanic have sold for a combined £100,000 at auction.

One was for a meal for first-class passengers the day the ship made its maiden voyage on April 10,1912.

It was taken as a souvenir by two 
fishmonger brothers, Richard and Stanley May, who used the Titanic as a 
way to reach Queenstown, Ireland, and departed the next day.

Rare: Two menus for lavish lunches on the Titanic have sold for a staggering £100,000

It was passed down through the family 
and brought to auction on November 24, where it sold for a record 
breaking price of £64,000.

The second menu sold was for a grand 
lunch held to celebrate the launch of the Titanic, held at noon on May 
31, 1911 which went for £36,000 in the same sale.

Dignitaries indulged in Champagne, 
foie gras, sole, lamb and roast beef after watching the luxury liner 
slip into the water for the very first time.

The event was staged by shipbuilders Harland and Wolff at the Grand Central Hotel in Belfast.

Hardly any menus for the lunch survive today and this one was kept by one of the 69 guests who attended the event.

A small enamel steward’s badge that 
was recovered from the drowned body of a passenger on the Titanic was 
also sold and went for £36,000.

The badge was worn by all stewards who
worked on the liner and this one displays the number 74, believed to be
the individual number for victim Fredrick Wormald.

The 44-year-old, of Testwood Road, 
Millbrook, had been wearing his uniform on the night of the disaster and
was one of the 1,522 people who died when Titanic sank.

The badge was recovered from his body along with a rusty set of keys that sold for £44,000.

Andrew Aldridge, of auctioneers Henry 
Aldridge and Son of Devizes, Wilts, said: ‘The saleroom was packed and 
we had interest from all over the world.

‘There was a lot of interest in the 
menu from April 10 because it was from the ship itself, it went for a 
record price for a menu from that date.

‘People who would have eaten from it 
would have been the cream of the cream, first class aristocrats and the 
most A list passengers on the Titanic.

‘It would have been their first meal 
on board the ship just after it set sail, they would have gone to their 
rooms, dropped off their bags, and gone to the first class restaurant.

‘The menu came off with two surviving 
brothers who used the Titanic as a way to cross the Irish sea and 
departed the next day when it reached Queenstown.

‘It was placed into an album by the 
brothers and passed down through the family before it came to auction, 
and was bought by an overseas collector.

‘We are very pleased with the auction, it was superb and we had numerous international phone and internet bidders.

‘The keys were fought over by several 
bidders but eventually went to an overseas collector, and the launch 
menu was sold to a UK collector.’

For luncheon on board, guests 
could choose from consomme jardiniere, hodge podge, beef steak and 
kidney pie, and roast surrey capon.

They could select grilled mutton chops or mashed, fried, and baked jacket potatoes from the grill.

Rice pudding, apples manhattan, and pastry were also on offer.

There was a selection of fresh 
lobsters, potted shrimps, soused herrings, sardines, roast beef, round 
of spiced beef, virginia and cumberland ham, bologna sausage, brawn, 
corned ox tongue, lettuce, and tongue from the buffet.

Guests then had the opportunity to 
choose from a range of cheeses, which were Cheshire, Stilton, 
Gorgonzola, Edam, Camembert, Roquefort, and St Ivel.

The menu from the lunch which 
celebrated the launch of the Titanic in May 31, 1911 includes champagne,
foie gras, sole, lamb, and roast beef.
