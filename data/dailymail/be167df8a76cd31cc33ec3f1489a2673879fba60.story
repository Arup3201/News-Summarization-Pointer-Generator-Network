A man in Southwest Florida with a ‘painful’ lump in his breast the size of a golf ball has been denied a mammogram screening because he is a man.

Donald Mudd said he's had a painful lump in his right breast over the last several weeks, according to Fox4Now.

He went to see his physician who told him he had a mass in his breast and he needed to get a mammogram.

Breast cancer?: Donald Mudd from Southwest Florida said he's had a painful lump in his right breast over the last several weeks

Check-up: Mudd went to see his physician who told him he had a mass in his breast and he needed to get a mammogram

Mudd does not have insurance, so he tried to get a mammogram at Fawcett Memorial Hospital, which advertises mammogram specials for Breast Cancer Awareness Month. 

‘I got transferred a number of times with the same result... that males don't qualify for the mammogram cancer screening,’ Mudd said. 

Mudd tried six different organisations to see if he could get a screening, but got the same result.

Kathy Shepard, Breast Health 
Navigator, said it's harder for men to get help because there's a stigma
that breast cancer only affects women.

‘The
majority of the people who are screened and treated for breast cancer 
are women but there are more and more men who have breast cancer issues,
and the reality is, not too many people are aware of that,’ Shepard 
said.

No insurance: The Southwest Florida man said he got turned away from a hospital that is advertising mammogram specials for Breast Cancer Awareness month

Turned away: He said he called at least six different organisations but all denied him access because he was male

Mudd has finally 
found help from the Susan G. Komen of Southwest Florida organisation, 
which grants money to clinics to offer screenings for uninsured 
patients, regardless of gender.

He has an appointment tomorrow at 
Virginia B. Andes Volunteer Clinic in Port Charlotte, which gets grant 
money from Susan G. Komen.

About
2,240 new cases of invasive breast cancer are diagnosed a year, and 
about 410 men will die from breast cancer, according to the American 
Cancer Society.
