Mexican authorities say four human heads have been found in a town in Michoacan, a western state where rural vigilantes sprang up a year ago to try to drive out a cult-like drug cartel called the Knights Templar, which is run by a crystal meth-selling former school teacher similar to the Walter White character in the hit television series Breaking Bad.

A federal official says police investigators also found a threatening note along with the human remains in Zacan but wouldn't reveal its content. The official spoke on condition of anonymity because he is not allowed to talk to the press.

He said the remains found Thursday belong to four men between 22 and 55 years of age.

The official said federal agents also found a pit in the nearby town of Tinguindin that may contain bodies.

Mexico has sent thousands of federal forces to Michoacan following shootouts between vigilantes and the Knights Templar cartel.

The Knights Templar is one of the most powerful - and ruthless - drug cartels in Mexico and currently engaged in a bloody war with several vigilante groups that are trying to rid Michoacan of blood-thirsty cartel.

The cartel was started by Servando Gomez-Martinez in 2011. Gomez-Martinez, a former teacher, is better know throughout the state as 'La Tutu,' or 'the teacher.'

In recent interviews given from his hideout somewhere in Michocan, Gomez-Martinez has described the cartel as a sort of necessary evil, claiming that if the Knights Temple weren't around to protect citizens, another cartel would soon take over and things could potentially be worse.

In February of 2013, vigilante groups started rising up against the Knights Templar's 
reign of terror and extortion after police and troops failed to stop the
 abuses.

Last month, the Mexican government essentially legalized the vigilante movement in Michoacan by reaching an agreement with vigilante leaders to incorporate the armed 
civilian groups into old and largely forgotten quasi-military units 
called the Rural Defense Corps. Vigilante groups estimate their numbers 
at 20,000 men under arms.

'The self-defense forces will become institutionalized, 
when they are integrated into the Rural Defense Corps,' the Interior 
Department said in a statement. Police and soldiers already largely 
tolerate, and in some cases even work with, the vigilantes, many of whom
 are armed with assault rifles that civilians are not allowed to carry.

Vigilante
 leaders will have to submit a list of their members to the Defense 
Department, and the army will apparently oversee the groups, which the 
government said 'will be temporary.' They will be allowed to keep their 
weapons as long as they register them with the army.

The military
 will give the groups 'all the means necessary for communications, 
operations and movement,' according to the agreement.

Vigilantes: Vigilante groups are fighting the Knights Templar at every turn, hoping to run the cartel out of Michoacan

Misael Gonzalez, a leader of the self-defense force in
 the town of Coalcoman, said leaders had accepted the government 
proposal. But the nuts-and-bolts 'are still not well defined,' he added. 'We won't start working on the mechanisms until tomorrow.'

Vigilante
 leader Hipolito Mora said the agreement also allows those who qualify 
to join local police forces. 'The majority of us want to get into the 
police ... I never imagined myself dressed as a policeman, but the 
situation is driving me to put on a uniform.'

Latin America has 
been bruised by experiences with quasi-military forces, with such 
tolerated or legally recognized groups being blamed for rights abuses in
 Guatemala and Colombia in the past.

While the cartel may be on 
its way out, 'there shouldn't be abuses by those who come after, there 
shouldn't be what we would call a witch hunt; there should be 
reconciliation,' said the Rev. Javier Cortes, part of a team of priests 
in the Roman Catholic diocese of Apatzingan who have publicly denounced 
abuses by the Knights Templar.

Before dawn on Monday, soldiers 
and police arrested one of the cartel's top leaders, Dionicio Loya 
Plancarte, alias 'El Tio,' or The Uncle.

National Public Safety System 
secretary Monte Rubido said the feared drug lord was arrested without a 
shot being fired. He said federal forces found Loya Plancarte in 
Morelia, the capital of Michoacan, 'hiding in a closet' and accompanied 
only by 16-year-old boy.

The vigilante groups were recently given the blessing of the Mexican government. Here, they detain several alleged cartel members

The 58-year-old Loya Plancarte had a 
30-million peso ($2.25 million) reward on his head from the Mexican 
government for drug, organized crime and money-laundering charges. He 
was considered one of the country's three dozen most-wanted drug lords 
in the late 2000s.

The Knights Templar ruled many parts of 
Michoacan with an iron fist, demanding extortion payments from 
businesses, farmers and workers, but the self-defense groups have gained
 ground against the cartel in recent months. Federal police and army 
troops were dispatched to bring peace to the troubled region, but the 
vigilantes have demanded the arrest of the cartel's major leaders before
 they lay down their guns.

Ramon Contreras, an activist in the 
vigilante movement from the town of La Ruana, which was the first to 
rise up against the Knights Templar, said the arrest 'means a lot' to 
the vigilantes, but added that they won't rest until they see all the 
top bosses arrested.

Contreras voiced a common belief that the 
man who founded the cartel under the name La Familia Michoacana, Nazario
 Moreno, alias 'El Chayo,' is still alive, despite the government's 
statement in 2010 that he had been killed in a shootout with federal 
forces.

'He's still alive; there's proof he's still alive,' Contreras said.

Loya
 Plancarte got his nickname, 'The Uncle,' because he is believed to be 
the uncle of another top Knights Templar leader, Enrique Plancarte 
Solis.

Loya Plancarte joined Plancarte Solis and Servando Gomez 
in forming the Knights Templar after the purported death of Nazario 
Moreno.
