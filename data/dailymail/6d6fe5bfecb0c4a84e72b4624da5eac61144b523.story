Two people were arrested when a brawl involving almost 300 wedding guests broke out at a reception in central New Jersey.

Middletown Township police said the party had been going on for several hours when the fight started on Sunday night around 10.30pm. It apparently began inside the hall and spilled out on to the street.

Officers arriving on scene found several guests who were mostly shoving each other and shouting, so assistance was sought from several nearby police departments.

The wedding reception had been underway for several hours in Middletown Township, New Jersey on Saturday when a fight broke out and spilled into the street

Bystanders told News12 that guests were urinating outside the Jacques Reception Center in Middletown.

According
 to a police statement, Sergeant William Colangelo and Patrolman Frank 
Mazza were working the reception as an off-duty assignment when they 
were alerted to a fight taking place.

The reception hall provides security for all of its events as part of the service.

The officers attempted to break up the 
fight when the crowd, of which many people had been drinking, swelled to about 80 people. The officers radioed for back-up to disperse the crowd.

As officers tried to gain 
control of the situation approximately 300 people became involved in the
 altercation which consisted of fighting, yelling and screaming and 
people refusing to leave the area and return inside to the reception, police reported. 

The Middletown police department received help from departments in Keansburg,
 Holmdel and Hazlet at the rowdy scene.

Police chiefs decided that the wedding had to be shut down because of the chaos. Order was eventually restored, but authorities shut down the reception and told the guests to leave. It took about 45 minutes to clear out the facility.

It’s not clear what sparked the brawl, but an iunvestigation is ongoing.

No injuries were reported. Jonathan Accardi, 32, from Oceanside, New York, was arrested for obstruction and disorderly conduct. Emily George, 23, from 
Haledon, New Jersey was arrested for disorderly conduct.

Both have been released and are awaiting a court date.
