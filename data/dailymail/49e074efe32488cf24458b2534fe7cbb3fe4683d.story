Sheffield United fans chanted their support for convicted rapist Ched Evans on Saturday night, in the club’s first game since their former player was released from jail.

Almost half the travelling fans at Bradford City’s Valley Parade voiced their support for the 25-year-old, who left Wymott Prison on Friday morning, as co-Chairmen Kevin McCabe and Jim Phipps continue to suggest he might by re-employed by the club.

At Bradford’s Forster Square station, 20 fans chanted: ‘He does what he wants, he does what he wants, Chedwyn Evans, he does what he wants.’ Police took no action.

Sheffield United's co-chairmen have continued to suggest Ched Evans might be resigned by the club 

As United played out a 2-0 win supporters could be heard singing, ‘Super, super Ched, super Chedwyn Evans’.

The club’s fan base is divided by Evans, who served half of a five-year sentence for raping a 19-year-old waitress. A petition against his re-signing has more than 150,000 signatures, but the overwhelming attitude of United fans at Bradford was one of support.

Sheffield United patron and women’s rights campaigner Charlie Webster said she would cease her involvement with the club if he is re-signed. ‘I don’t believe it’s sending the right message to the next generation to employ a convicted rapist,’ she said.
