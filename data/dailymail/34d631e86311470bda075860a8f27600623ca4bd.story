Early evening on Monday night and the Arena Khimki could not have looked less inviting as Manchester City trained in solitude in the sleet of an early winter' s day. When they face CSKA for real later on Tuesday, there is no reason to suspect it will be any different.

Certainly it won't get any warmer. Temperatures are predicted to be as low as minus five by the time this crucial Group E game kicks off at 8pm local time on Tuesday.

Nor will this rather mundane stadium be any more atmospheric. A UEFA sanction means CSKA must face City behind closed doors.

Punishment designed to affect the home team, it was tempting to wonder last night if it will do Pellegrini and his players any favours either.

Players, after all, rely at least in part on some kind of atmosphere to quicken the blood and last night City's manager offered his own words of regret that this is the path the European governing body have chosen in the wake of violence and racist chanting that marred CSKA games last season.

Pellegrini said: 'It will be very strange with everybody being able to hear the players' voices during the game. But we have no option and we must play that way.

'Many may think the local team will suffer the most damage, but I think the biggest loser is the game of football.

'It's a pity that we can't play with fans. This show is for fans and it will be a strange game.'

It was easy to understand Pellegrini's standpoint. The stadium will certainly have a strange feel on Tuesday.

What he must hope is that his players rise to the occasion in their minds at least. Having taken just a point from two opening games, City must win in Moscow if their Champions League hopes are not to disappear down the river for another season.

City's Brazilian midfielder Fernandinho said: 'I have experienced it twice before and it is different. You have to keep your concentration on the pitch and try to win the game.

'I don't think it will be an advantage for us.

'It is always good when you play away because the home fans support their team and it gives you more motivation to play well.

'I don't think this [a closed stadium] is good for either team or for football.'

CSKA's players did their best to liven up things up a bit on Monday by suggesting their opponents from the Premier League have some weaknesses when they don't have the ball.

Maybe they were watching as Tottenham troubled City sporadically at the weekend.

Striker Ahmed said: 'As you can see, City are very weak this year. We are going to use that advantage against them.

'In a couple of games they haven't been that good. They are very weak in the defence, so we are going to do our best to work against that.

'I think we are going to have a great opportunity and Tuesday is going to be a very good game for us.

'We are going to do our best to win because this is the last opportunity that we have.'

Quite properly, Pellegrini did not respond when asked about this on Monday. The Chilean knows that if City play anywhere near to their capabilities they will win the game, just as they did here last year. 

The City coach was willing to talk about his own midfielder Yaya Toure, though, and rejected suggestions that the Ivorian's future may lie as a second striker after rather indifferent European displays at the base of his team's midfield at Bayern Munich and at home to Roma.

Anyone who has seen Toure play this season will recognise that he is becoming something of a liability alongside Fernandinho when not at his best. 

His midfield partner had to do so much work in Munich that he ended the night with cramp.

However, Pellegrini insisted last night that the 31-year-old will be back to his best before long and remains of the Premier League's most eminent players in his natural position. 

Asked if Toure's future lies further up the field, Pellegrini said: 'It can be an option because he has the quality to play behind the striker.

'But in our team he's a very important midfielder and he will continue to play in that role.

'When he plays well in his midfield position he is the best at that role in the Premier League.'

Despite the peculiar circumstances on Tuesday, they perhaps represents City's biggest game of the season. 

Ahead of the return next month, they are already offering two tickets for the price of one.

Lose tonight and even that may not be enough to drag them through the gates.
