Julia Roberts and Hugh Grant pictured together in the 1999 film Notting Hill

He prefers to remain tight-lipped about the women in his private life.

But when it comes to his on-screen leading ladies, Hugh Grant is not so discreet.

Describing the time he ‘got off’ with Julia Roberts when they starred together in 1999 film Notting Hill, he remarked: ‘It’s a big mouth. I was aware of a faint echo when I was kissing her.’

In the film, Grant plays bookshop owner William Thacker, who meets Hollywood superstar Anna Scott (Miss Roberts) when she comes in to buy a book. The film follows their rendezvous as they fall in love.

Renee Zellweger, Grant’s co-star in the Bridget Jones’s Diary films, fares better in his critique: Miss Zellweger, he says, is a ‘top snogger’.

The 54-year-old actor claimed he engaged in ‘competitive snogging’ to try to beat Colin Firth, who played his love rival in both films, adding: ‘You will have to ask Renee who she preferred. I think Colin tried too hard.’

In comments that could be seen to reflect the caddish attitude of his Bridget Jones character Daniel Cleaver, Grant added: ‘I can’t think of a leading lady that I have not fancied.

‘You have got to fancy them as otherwise it is no fun. What is the point of doing a film?’

Appearing on Alan Carr’s Chatty Man show last night as he promoted his latest film The Rewrite, Grant revealed: ‘I am very queeny about who I play opposite.

He added: ‘I am Barbra Streisand when it comes to film making. You never know with chemistry anyway. Sometimes you loathe each other. Sometimes hate comes over as love. I’ve had some amazing leading ladies.

‘The ones I really got on with are Sandra Bullock and Sarah Jessica Parker.’

Grant also discussed his decision to pull out of the third Bridget Jones film.

‘They are going to make [another film] but without me,’ he said. ‘I am quite huffy. I would have done it but I don’t think the script was there. It will probably be a huge mistake.’
