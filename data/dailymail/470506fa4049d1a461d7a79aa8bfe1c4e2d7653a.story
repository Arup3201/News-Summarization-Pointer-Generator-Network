A class of nursery school children in Russia has been photographed handling mock guns and grenades amid Western concerns over the country's alleged rising militarization as the crisis in Ukraine deepens.

The pictures - which have sparked fury as well as admiration on the Russian web - were taken at a kindergarten in Vladimir Putin's home city of St Petersburg.

The image was photographed on 23 February, a day traditionally marked in the Soviet Union as Red Army Day.

A class of nursery school children in Russia has been photographed handling mock guns and grenades amid Western concerns over the country's alleged rising militarization as the crisis in Ukraine deepens

The pictures - which have sparked fury as well as admiration on the Russian web - were taken at a kindergarten in Vladimir Putin's home city of St Petersburg

Now it is known as Defender of the Fatherland Day, a public holiday when Russians recall the extraordinary sacrifices made by soldiers in World War Two and other conflicts.

The event involving the children - aged five and six - was organised by a father who serves in the Russian army.

'One of the parents is a military man, he decided to show some guns and weapons to the children on Defender of the Fatherland Day,' said Alexei Golovkin, co-ordinator of patriotic movement 'Resistance' in St Petersburg.

He stepped in to support the father and the nursery after a wave of online protest.

'These dummies were shown to the children,' he said, denying web claims that the children had handled real weapons.

'The parents were not against this idea. They posted the pictures online.'

The children were shown and allowed to handle mock sniper rifles, Kalashnikov machine guns, and grenade-shooting guns as well as hand grenades

He stressed: 'I organise similar events in clubs for teenagers. When I was young we used sticks to play war games.

'If only I had a chance to hold such a toy when I was in the nursery, I think I would have wet my trousers from happiness.'

He claimed the children's introduction to the weapons of war had nothing to do with the Ukraine crisis, in which the West accuses the Russian army of operating inside its neighbour's borders.

'It is just demonstration of the guns,' he said.

The organiser of this event was not a 'defender' in Ukraine.

The children were shown and allowed to handle mock sniper rifles, Kalashnikov machine guns, and grenade-shooting guns as well as hand grenades.

The father behind the event was named as army major Vitaliy Statsenko, 31, but the kindergarten director was taken aback by hostile comments.

Margarita Ivanova said: 'We could not even imagine an ordinary class about the profession of a military man will end like this.

'We organised it in the senior group of children. We asked every parent's permission, but we were surprised to see the pictures posted online, and some of the comments.'

She was called to explain the event by the city's educational authorities but no punishment is being brought against her.

One furious blogger wrote: 'Instead of saying 'thank you' they carpeted her. Who are they bringing up in these nurseries? Maybe gays and lesbians, like in the West?'

'This should be done regularly,' said another, 'and we will return to the good old times when young men dreamed of serving in the army, and young girls despised those who did not serve.'

Another supporter said: 'Don't you see what kind of world we are living in now? Russia must be strong and these kids must be ready for all challenges.'

Hostile comments included 'judging by this photo, they are bringing up killers', 'we are growing terrorists from nursery age' and 'if you want to teach patriotism in the nursery, do it with singing or dancing'.
