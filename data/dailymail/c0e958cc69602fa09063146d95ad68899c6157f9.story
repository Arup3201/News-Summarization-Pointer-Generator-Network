Harry Redknapp admitted the price will have to be right if he is to sign Jermain Defoe.

The QPR manager tried desperately to sign the Toronto FC striker in the summer transfer window and wants to buy him in January.

But the 32-year-old will reportedly want upwards of £80,000-a-week and Toronto claim they want to keep a striker they signed on a four-year deal in February.

The numbers will make or break the deal, according to Redknapp, who gave Defoe his West Ham debut in 1999, signed him for Portsmouth in 2008, and bought him again for Spurs in 2009.

Redknapp said: ‘There is no deal close for Jermain yet. I am a big fan of Jermain, I have signed him enough.

‘We tried to sign him in the summer but it couldn’t be done so we will have to wait and see on that one.

‘He is a player we are interested in but the figures have to be right.

‘I haven’t spoken to the chairman about it but we will see, I know what we need. The figures would have to be right, and it's a player we would like.’

Redknapp, meanwhile, admitted he is surprised Rio Ferdinand has not appealed his three-game ban for his recent Twitter spat.

Redknapp said: ‘I spoke to Rio. I thought he was going to appeal. It was unjust. I thought it was a heavy punishment. Someone criticised him and he criticised back. If you criticise me, and I criticised back - that's life.

‘It is heavy but he just wants to move on.’
