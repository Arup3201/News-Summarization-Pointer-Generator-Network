Film fans are flocking to copy James Bond by taking a breathtaking leap off the dam featured in the iconic opening sequence of GoldenEye.

Thrill-seekers can pay up to £170 to bungee jump off the 720ft-high Contra Dam, also known as the Verzasca Dam, on the Verzasca River in Ticino, Switzerland.

In the action-packed opening sequence of the 1995 film, which marked Pierce Brosnan's debut as 007, Bond can be seen fearlessly throwing himself off the dam before turning his gun to the camera and pulling the trigger.

Thousands of film fans have flocked to Contra Dam in Switzerland to experience the thrill of falling 720ft - before bouncing back up on the bungee

GoldenEye marked Pierce Brosnan's debut as 007, though the jump seen in the film was performed by stuntman Wayne Michaels.

Operators of the breathtaking bungee claim that the dam is one of the most well-known and memorable film locations in Europe.

Built between 1961 and 1965, Contra Dam has featured in a number of films and TV shows.

Soon
 after GoldenEye was released, the dam owners started to lease the dam 
out to bungee operators. It is thought some 20,000 people have already 
made the daring jump off the dam.

A Swiss tourism spokesman told the Daily Mirror: 'The bungee jump is an unforgettable experience that gives you a chance to feel what it's like to be an international hero like James Bond.

'People absolutely love the thrill of it. You can't get this sort of excitement anywhere else.'

James Bond's bungee jump in this film was voted one as the best movie stunt of all time in a movie by Sky Movies poll in 2002.
