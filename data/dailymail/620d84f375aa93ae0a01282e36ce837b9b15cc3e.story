A distinguished politician's young wife, who allegedly featured in a sex tape with her drug-addicted lover, has caused her husband yet more embarrassment as further details of the affair emerge.

Nadia Lockyer, 40, has now been accused of posing as her ex-boyfriend's lawyer on three occasions to visit him in Santa Clara County jail, California, where he was locked up on drug-related charges.

The accusations marred her first appearance in her capacity as Alameda County Supervisor since the scandal emerged. Her loyal husband, 70-year-old state treasurer Bill Lockyer, was by her side.

The claims come a month after she started a substance-abuse program following a violent clash with her ex-boyfriend, Stephen Chikhani, in a Newark hotel. She suffered head and neck injuries.

'She did not misrepresent herself,' Mrs Lockyer's aide Rub√©n Briones told the San Fransisco Chronicle. 'She was providing pro bono legal advice as requested by Mr. Chikhani's father.'

But Chikhani's attorney, Adrienne Dell, said this was 'not true'.

'Mr. Chikhani's father has never spoken to Nadia Lockyer regarding representation of his son,' Dell told the Chronicle. 'I think this is an abuse of power.'

Lockyer, who has an eight-year-old son with her husband of ten years, avoided reporters as she nipped from meetings at the conference centre, saying: 'I just want to get some work done.'

But in a prepared statement, Lockyer wrote she was 'glad to be back on my feet'.

She said: 'I take full responsibility for the personal mistakes I have made and the personal amends I must make. And I deeply apologize to those I love and those who love me.'

Her aide would not confirm if doctors had cleared her to check out of rehab. It is her first appearance since she entered the addiction center in February for unspecified chemical dependency.

She had checked herself into rehab following the 3am incident with her ex-boyfriend, whom she described as a 'stalker', at the Homewood Suites in Newark, California. It left her hospitalised.

Chikhani claimed
he acted in self-defense after Mrs Lockyer invited him to the 
hotel. A fight allegedly erupted as Lockyer was reportedly jealous Chikhani may have been seeing other women.

He revealed he had been having a year-long affair with 
the politician's wife, whom he had met during an earlier rehab stint.

Chikhani, who has a long history of arrests for methamphetamine use, also checked himself into rehab after the incident. He was not arrested for his part in the alleged attack.

Ahead of the incident, Bill Lockyer had told the Alameda County district attorney's office he had been given a sex tape involving his wife and Chikhani.

Mr Lockyer added that his wife was being blackmailed to stay in the relationship for fear of having her private life exposed.

Mr Lockyer contacted
the DA's office to obtain a restraining order against 
the man, suggesting he might make the tape public.The DA's office refused to confirm this to MailOnline.

District Attorney Nancy O'Malley denied having any knowledge of the tape, the Chronicle reported. She turned over the assault investigation to the state attorney general.

Lockyer added in her statement: 'I'll have more to say after the attorney general's office completes their work.'

Mr Lockyer, one of California's longest-serving elected officials, has been married to Nadia since 2003. They met ten years ago when he had already been 
married twice.

She was four years younger than his only daughter from 
one a previous marriage. Two months after they wed in April 2003, their son was born. They live in Hayward in the bay area.

Mr Lockyer has been State treasurer of California since 2006 and also served as California's Attorney General.

His wife has been a public interest lawyer since 1997. She 
was elected to the Alameda County Board of Supervisors in November 
2010.

Mr Lockyer previously said his 
wife's ex-boyfriend 'seems to have a long history of involvement with 
the criminal justice 
system, but her [Nadia's] only fault is occasionally having one too many
drinks'.
