A Peruvian footballer who was struck by lightning during a match on Tuesday is thought to be in a stable condition in hospital.

Joao Contreras, 21, of Sport Aguila was struck down by the lightning bolt during the second leg of a Copa Peru semi final-match against Fuerza Miner.

The lightning bolt is not visible during footage captured of the incident, but a large puff of smoke emerges from Contreras following a loud crash as he instantly collapses.

It was initially reported that Contreras had died as a result of his injuries, and was even announced on the club's Twitter feed.

But Peruvian news agencies now say the player survived the incident and is recovering in hospital after suffering third-degree burns.

An assistant referee and another player also felt the effects of the bolt and several other players were treated for shock as the game was abandoned.

'It's a miracle from God that they are safe and saved,' Sport Aguila manager Raul Ortega told Pervuian newspaper El Comercio.

'The lightning struck very close to them. Happily they are talking and communicating with their families and there isn't a problem.'

Sport Aguila captain Amilcar Lobon told the newspaper Diario Correo his team-mate's condition was improving.

'Thank God he's okay, he's getting better, and now we're just thinking about his recovery,' Lobon said. 'It's difficult to imagine this situation that just doesn't happen in Huancayo.

'As I reiterate, the important thing is that our friend Joao is out of danger.'
