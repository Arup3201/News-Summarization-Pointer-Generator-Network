Adam Johnson could feature for new boss Dick Advocaat in Sunderland's fight for survival after the club confirmed it will 'review its position' regarding his suspension.

Sunderland banned Johnson, 27, pending the outcome of a police investigation after he was arrested on March 2 on suspicion of sexual activity with a 15-year-old girl. On Tuesday Johnson's bail was extended by five weeks until April 23.

The club said in a statement: 'Following the decision by the police, the club will be reviewing its position.'

Johnson  has been training with a fitness coach and if the club decide to lift his suspension the £10million winger could play his first match at home in the Tyne-Wear derby against Newcastle on Easter Sunday.

Johnson scored the only goal at St James' Park in the reverse fixture in December and it would prove a hostile environment in which to return.

Before that, Sunderland travel to West Ham on Saturday with Advocaat in charge for the first time.

Sportsmail understands that regardless of whether Advocaat keeps them in the Premier League, he will return to Holland in May. There is a feeling in his homeland that his wife, Dieuwke, has allowed the 67-year-old to fulfil his ambition of managing in England before he retires.

Sunderland owner Ellis Short said: 'Dick has an incredible c.v. and vast experience of managing at the very highest level. We have one aim only now — to climb the table.'

Advocaat said: 'Sunderland is a big club and I am very much looking forward to the challenge. I can't wait to get started.'

But Sunderland do not see the former Rangers and Holland chief as a long-term option. It is understood sporting director Lee Congerton will speak to Real Madrid assistant Paul Clement — with whom he worked at Chelsea — about a summer appointment.

At 42 and with a reputation as one of Europe's finest coaches, Clement is the sort of head coach the club want to bring stability and long-term vision. Peter Lovenkrands, who was signed by Advocaat during his time at Ibrox, told Sportsmail he is among the best managers he has worked under.

'He was excellent at what he did,' said the Dane, who went on to play for Newcastle.

'When I first signed I had a lot of problems with injuries and I remember my hamstring going for about the fourth time. I was sat on the bench nearly in tears. He came across, put his arm around me and told me everything would be OK. It was a nice touch and he had that in him.

'A lot of people thought he was a dictator, and he could be quite intimidating, but deep down I thought he was a decent and nice man.

'He had a good sense of humour and the lads loved him. He used to swear all the time in training but we didn't have a clue and it was only the Dutch players who told us — we soon picked up the translation!'
