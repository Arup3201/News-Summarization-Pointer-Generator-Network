Tour operator Thomas Cook has been ordered to pay more than £17,000 in compensation to a holidaymaker who became violently ill during his dream holiday in the Caribbean.

Paul Hughes, from Redditch, Worcestershire, faces ongoing gastric symptoms following his ‘nightmare’ getaway at a resort in Cayo Guillermo, Cuba, his solicitors said.

The 52-year-old booked the trip to the four-star Iberostar Daiquiri Hotel through Thomas Cook and he took legal action over ‘appalling’ hygiene conditions that he claims led to his illness.

Mr Hughes alleges undercooked food was served to guests, public areas in the hotel were dirty and he witnessed a chef leaving the toilet without washing his hands.

He said: ‘Upon falling ill I suffered severe sickness and diarrhoea and extremely painful stomach cramps, it was horrendous.

‘Three months after we came home, my symptoms still hadn’t gone so I saw my GP who provided me with advice as to how to deal with my symptoms.

'My bowel habits still haven’t returned to normal and it feels like I’ve been left with a permanent reminder of the awful trip. It has been very hard to get used to this.’

Thomas Cook admitted liability for Mr Hughes’ illness, but his solicitors from the law firm Irwin Mitchell had to proceed to trial after the tour operator refused to agree a settlement which reflected the severity of his condition, the law firm said.

At the end of a trial at the County Court in Birmingham, a judge agreed Thomas Cook must pay Mr Hughes compensation of more than £17,000. 

Thomas Cook said in a statement that it is disappointed by the outcome of the court ruling, but it accepts the judge’s verdict and is satisfied that the matter has been resolved.

The tour operator said: ‘We feel it is important to note that our own findings with regards to the exact nature of the illness differed greatly from those of Mr Hughes’ representatives.’

Thomas Cook said it closely evaluates the health, safety and hygiene standards of properties, and the Iberostar Daiquiri Hotel scores high in customer satisfaction surveys.

‘Our records show that sickness levels among customers staying at the resort since 2011 have been minimal,’ the company said.

‘Accordingly, we believe Mr Hughes’ illness to be a rare occurrence and are confident that those due to stay at the Iberostar Daiquiri Hotel will enjoy the quality holiday experience they would come to expect from Thomas Cook.’

Mr Hughes said he is still scared to eat in restaurants after falling ill during the two-week trip with his wife in January 2011.

He said: ‘I used to eat out a lot with my family but tend not to anymore as I’m too worried about suffering anything similar to what I had to go through in Cuba.

‘Nothing can turn back the clock but I am relieved the legal battle is now over. I just hope that my case acts as a reminder to those in the travel industry about the importance of following good hygiene practices so no one else has to go through a similar ordeal.’

Clare Comiskey, an international travel law expert at Irwin Mitchell’s Birmingham office, said: 'Tour operators have a responsibility to ensure that the hotels they send their customers to are safe and comply with health and safety regulations, which are in place to protect guests.

‘It is disappointing that we had to issue court proceedings and then take Paul’s case all the way to trial in order to secure justice for him.

‘This is particularly unfortunate given the ordeal he has already been through, but we hope that the settlement draws a line under this chapter of his life and allows him to begin to move forward.’
