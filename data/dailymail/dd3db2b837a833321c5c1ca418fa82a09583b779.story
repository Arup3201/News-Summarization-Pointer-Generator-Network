Grant Shapps (pictured) likened the Business Secretary to a 'rude uncle' who 'ruins Christmas'

A senior Tory yesterday branded Vince Cable a ‘rude old uncle’ who ruins Christmas.

Grant Shapps spoke out after the Lib Dem Business Secretary accused David Cameron of spreading panic on immigration like Enoch Powell.

Other Conservatives demanded that the Prime Minister sack Mr Cable for his incendiary remarks on Sunday.

The Business Secretary said the Tories’ ‘populist policies’ on immigration were damaging Britain and compared them to Mr Powell’s notorious 1968 Rivers of Blood speech.

His comments came ahead of an expected influx of migrants from Romania and Bulgaria when restrictions are lifted on January 1.

Yesterday Conservative chairman Mr Shapps said: ‘Vince Cable’s a bit like an old uncle at Christmas.

‘Slightly rude, does not always make sense, but he is part of the extended family so you have to live with it.’

Conservative MPs demanded a fight back by Downing Street, which has declined to fuel the row by denouncing Mr Cable. Many fear that if the claim is allowed to stand it could cost the Tories key votes, especially among ethnic minorities.

Backbencher Peter Bone said Mr Cameron should defend his policies, which include ensuring that migrants cannot claim benefits for their first three months in the UK.

‘He’s got to come out and say we’re not the nasty party,’ he said. ‘We’re not racists, we’re not targeting foreigners. That’s completely and utterly ridiculous.

'Someone should be out there saying that.

‘If Vince Cable was a Conservative minister he would have been fired already. The idea that David Cameron is behaving like Enoch Powell is completely absurd.’

Fellow Tory Philip Davies said: 
‘Cable is appalled by his Government but he is very happy to keep taking
 his fat Cabinet salary. I have nothing but contempt for him and his 
duplicity.’

And
 Nigel Mills, a Tory MP who wants greater restrictions on Romanians and 
Bulgarians, said: ‘Just to leave radio silence isn’t really helping.'

'Some people might think we’re too scared to talk about this issue.’

The Liberal Democrat has been criticised by Conservatives for allegedly spreading panic on immigration

Mr Cable’s remarks are the latest in a long line of complaints about Tory policies – none of which have yet prompted him to resign.

At the Lib Dem conference this year he made it known that he would not vote to back a motion calling for the maintenance of current Coalition deficit reduction plans, but he eventually caved in after pressure from Nick Clegg.

Mr Cable also believes George Osborne has cut too deeply into public services and he has repeatedly denounced the Chancellor’s Help to Buy scheme aimed at help people get on the housing ladder.

On Sunday he told the BBC’s Andrew Marr Show that Home Secretary Theresa May’s desire to cap EU migrants at 75,000 a year was ‘illegal and impossible to implement’ and claimed Tory interventions are doing ‘a great deal of damage’ to Britain.

‘We periodically get these 
immigration panics,’ he said. ‘I remember going back to Enoch Powell and
 Rivers of Blood and all that, and if you go back a century there were 
panics over Jewish immigrants.’

A
 No 10 source said that Mr Cameron would not rise to Mr Cable’s abuse 
because his attack has ‘so little credibility it isn’t worth it’.

Britain’s
 economy will pay a big price if the Conservatives meet their target of 
getting annual net immigration below 100,000, a think-tank has warned.

The
 National Institute for Economic and Social Research said keeping 
immigration numbers in five figures would slash 11 per cent off gross 
domestic product by 2060.

This is the equivalent of £165billion at today’s prices, or about £2,600 for every person in the country.

Britain is accused of breaching almost 50 EU rules over items ranging from tractors to toys – and even garlic.

In what will be seen as more meddling from Brussels, the Government is being pursued for failing to follow dozens of European Commission directives and other legal agreements.

If ministers fail to address the allegations, lawsuits could end up in crippling fines at the European Court of Justice.

One claim, concerning import duties on fresh garlic from China, was sent to the court in September.

Eurocrats also want to take action over the delayed implementation of a directive about emissions from narrow track tractors, introduced by the Commission in February.

Other complaints, about which few details have been disclosed, concern toy safety, the cleanliness of beaches, the energy performance of buildings and vehicles nearing their ‘end of life’.

Details of the 47 legal actions, obtained under freedom of information laws from the Cabinet Office, will fuel the fierce debate about Britain’s role in Europe.

Although David Cameron wants to renegotiate membership and has promised an ‘in or out’ referendum in 2017 if he remains in power, he faces pressure from his own party as well as eurosceptics in the UK Independence Party.

London’s Tory mayor Boris Johnson wrote yesterday that no ‘positive case’ was being made for staying in the EU, which he said had become known for ‘agreeing standards for widgets’.

And UKIP leader Nigel Farage said: ‘You only have to look at the list of proceedings to understand that the EU now regulates and controls every single, little aspect of our lives.’

A legal expert who advises ministers about infringement told the Daily Telegraph that such cases can drag on for years.

Often the Commission has simply misunderstood the situation, he added.

A Foreign Office spokesman said Britain has fewer so-called open infringements than other countries and supported the ‘timely and consistent’ application of EU law across the union.
