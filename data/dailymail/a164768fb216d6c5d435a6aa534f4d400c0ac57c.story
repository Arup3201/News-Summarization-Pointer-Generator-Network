An Atlanta man shattered the record for fastest drive from New York City to Los Angeles last Saturday by making the transcontinental trip in 28 hours 50 minutes.

Ed Bolian spent years outfitting a 2004 Mercedes with expensive gadgetry, spare gas tanks, and, of course, bedpans and finally realized his dream October 20. That smashes the record set in 2006 by an unbelievable two hours.

But his attempt is sure to gather controversy as it involved traveling at an average of 98mph, well in excess of many speed limits. He also used a series of gadgets to avoid getting caught for speeding.

Vaunted vessel: Bolian and company made their historic dash across the continent in this CL Class Mercedes and some help from a few extra gizmos and additions

Mind blowing: Atlanta Lamborghini dealership manager Ed Bolian has broken the record for fastest transcontinental drive from New York to Los Angeles by two hours. He did it in 28 hours 50 minutes

The Lamborghini dealership sales director is hesitant to show off the proof, but according to Jalopnik, the 27-year-old has GPS data tracking every inch of the journey he took with a co-pilot and passenger starting October 19.

‘I've wanted to break the record since I was 18 years old,’ Bolian said, explaining away the trip’s huge costs and many risks.

He began putting all the pieces together years ago, first by buying a used CL-Class blue Mercedes from a man in Palm Beach, Florida.

‘I thought about a Ferrari 612,’ said Ed. ‘But gas mileage would've been bad. A Bentley would've been perfect, but you'd want the V8 for gas mileage, and those are still way too expensive.’

Souped up: Bolian planned the trip for years and pumped untold sums into the car for GPS, laser jammers, CB radio, and other gizmos that helped ferry him safely and very quickly through a dozen states

Large tanks: In order to cut down on fuel stops, Bolian installed two 22-gallon addition gas tanks that let him drive 800 miles straight--with the help of bedpans

Famous race: A zany 1981 comedy starring Burt Reynolds, Farrah Fawcett, and Dom Deluise immortalized the Cannonball Run, which took place in real life for much of the 1970s

The origins of the Cannonball Run aren't entirely clear, but the death defying and hugely illegal race from New York City to Los Angeles is named after Edwin 'Cannonball' Baker.

Baker made history in 1933 when, apparently just to say he did it, he raced from coast to coast in 53 hours 30 minutes in a car called the Blue Streak.

Fast forward to the 1970s, when cars could go far faster than Baker's Graham Paige, and Car and Driver editor Brock Yates created the Cannonball Baker Sea-To-Shining Sea Memorial Trophy Dash.

For years, daring drivers vied for the title of what became known as the Cannonball Run.

A 1981 comedy starring Burt Reynolds and Farrah Fawcett immortalized the name.

The run was last completed by Dave Heinz and Dave Yarborough in 32 hours 51 minutes behind the wheel of a Jaguar.

Their record was next bested in the US Express race, which replaced the illicit Cannonball Run, by Doug Turner and David Diem.

Their time of 32 hours and 7 minutes wasn't beaten until Alex Roy did it in 31 hours 4 minutes in a BMW in 2006.

Now, they're all Cannonball also-rans and Bolian's feat won't be easily topped.

He chose the Mercedes for its fuel economizing V8 engine and active suspension he needed in order to pack in as much fuel as possible.

Bolian’s whip boasts two additional 22-gallon gas tanks, which add hundreds of pounds of fuel but allow the car to travel 800 miles between stops.

But breaking the record was going to take more than just a souped up Mercedes. To ensure a clear run, free from traffic jams and, perhaps more importantly, traffic cops Bolian, also invested in a police scanner, two GPS units that relay traffic information and iPhone apps such as Trapster.

The car was also fitted with two laser jammers and had a truck mounted antenna.

Friends were enlisted to travel along the route, about 150 miles ahead of the Mercedes, and check for any potential obstacles.

Bolian decided to take the classic route pioneered by the illegal street racers of the 1970s’ Cannonball Baker Sea-To-Shining Sea Memorial Trophy Dash of the 1970s AKA Cannonball Run: Red Ball Garage in Midtown Manhattan to the Portofino Hotel in Redondo Beach, California.

'I've wanted to break the record since I was 18 years old': Bolian has now lived his dream and didn't get a single ticket on the way

'I don't even remember Indiana': Bolian says it was tough getting out of Manhattan, but once they did it was smooth sailing all the way to LA

Almost here: They got to California as the sun rose on October 20. They could have played it safe and gone the speed limit as the rising western sun blinded them Instead, they pushed it in order to make their feat all the more impressive

And they're off: The classic starting line and the place where Bolian's historic run began, the Red Ball Garage, sits between Lexington and Third Avenues in Manhattan

Cool finish: The Cannonball Run ends here, at Redondo Beach, California's Portofino Hotel, 2,813.7 from where it begins in New York City

‘Every year, Alex hears about five to seven attempts to break the record,’ said E. ‘None of the challengers come close.’

But by far the most difficult part of Bolian’s endeavor, he said, was finding people to make the trip with him.

With only two weeks until he was scheduled to go, nobody had agreed to take on the challenge with him.

Then, after trawling deep within his Facebook friends, he found Dan Huang.

‘I got a Facebook message from Ed,’ Huang told Jalopnik, ‘He didn't even have my cell phone number.’

Along with a friend of Bolian’s, David Black, as co-pilot, the three of them piled into the Mercedes on October 19.

Proof: Bolian used technology to track and eventually prove his feat, hiring a GPS company to follow him every inch of the way and even gauge his speed

Things did not go well initially.

‘It took us 15 minutes to get out of Manhattan,’ Ed said.

But then things quickly picked up. They had friends drive ahead and check for cops and obstacles. New Jersey passed, then Pennsylvania, then Ohio.

They kept a breakneck pace. ‘I don't even remember Indiana,’ Ed said.

By the time they got to Texas, they were making such good time that they could have gone the speed limit the rest of the way and still tied Roy’s time.

Instead, they pushed it. And on October 20, they reached Redondo Beach, California’s Portofino Hotel.

They’d beat the record by an astonishing two hours and gone down in history with the fastest Cannonball run drive in history.

Astonishing: With Bolian at the wheel, Black as co-pilot, and Huang on a spare tire in back, the trio drove 2,813.7 in 28 hours 50 minutes
