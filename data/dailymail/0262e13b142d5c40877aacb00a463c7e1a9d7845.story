No footballer wants to be out injured but how strange it can be when your stock rises during an enforced absence, as if you become a better player, at least among those who don’t know what they’ve got until it has gone.

Michael Carrick sat on the bench at The Hawthorns, watching Manchester United chasing around in the chaos of a thrilling 2-2 draw, unable to strike the balance between adventure and caution.

Louis van Gaal insists he will never curb his desire to entertain but his team requires a keystone, a steadying influence to conduct its fabulous attackers, while offering a little help to those responsible for protecting the goal behind David de Gea.

Michael Carrick returned to the Manchester United squad for the draw with West Brom on Monday 

Thoughts turned to Carrick, even though he remained among the substitutes. He might be the one. Van Gaal needed to find goals against West Bromwich Albion, having trailed for much of the game, but in the long-term he needs control.

In the Sky Sports studio, Gary Neville implored the manager to bring back the 33-year-old midfielder, who has been out since ankle surgery in the summer, in time to face Chelsea on Sunday and Manchester City, a week later.

In May, Carrick was omitted from England’s World Cup squad after a campaign when he could be found toiling away at the heart of United’s disarray as they slipped out of the Champions League and David Moyes lost his job.

Carrick has been a key player for United over the past few seasons and won his England place back

Roy Hodgson – advised by coaching assistants Ray Lewington and Neville – decided there was no place for Carrick in Brazil, preferring Frank Lampard and Steven Gerrard as his experienced central midfielders.

Carrick, despite a general consensus that he has got better with age, has not won an England cap since starting in the final World Cup qualifier against Poland, a 2-0 win at Wembley just over a year ago.

However, Lampard and Gerrard have retired from international football and Hodgson has reshaped his team to deploy a midfielder diamond, which has offered encouragement as it accommodates two strikers and a creator like Raheem Sterling.

Carrick thrives in his role as a holding midfielder for United 

What he is missing is a natural holding midfielder. Not necessarily a ball-winner but a deep play-maker who can pass long or short with both feet and dictate the tempo; someone with positional sense and the ability to read the rhythms of a game, preferably with physical presence and a little defensive instinct.

Jack Wilshere has coped well, but it is a role perfect for Carrick. After a 13-year international career of 31 caps, one retirement and one come-back, England are playing with a system suited to his strengths, while Gerrard and Lampard have quit.

Carrick could work perfectly in Roy Hodgson's new system  

Whether Hodgson will - or even should -return to Carrick is debateable. England are building a team for the future. His return would only deny Wilshere more experience in a role he is learning but if Hodgson is unsure about Wilshere the anchorman – as Arsene Wenger is – then he can recall the Manchester United midfielder as he develops an alternative.

At United, there is no debate. Van Gaal will restore Carrick to the starting line-up, as soon as his fitness levels allow, either to anchor the midfield on his own in a diamond, releasing Daley Blind to fulfil other duties, perhaps at left-back, or alongside Blind in a 4-2-3-1 formation for these two tough fixtures against Chelsea and City.
