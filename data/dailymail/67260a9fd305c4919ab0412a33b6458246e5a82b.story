Theodore John Kaczynski killed three people and injured 23 others in a bombing spree that spanned almost two decades

A Sacramento judge has approved the payment of $232,000 (£142,000) to the victims and survivors of the so-called Unabomber, having raised the money through auctioning off his possessions.

Theodore 'Ted' Kaczynski killed three people and injured 23 others in a bombing spree around Illinois and California that spanned almost two decades.

The Chicago-born 69-year-old Harvard graduate, who was sentenced to life imprisonment without parole in May 1998 and is currently housed in Colorado, pleaded guilty to the bombings, which began in 1978.

In August 2010 District Judge Garland Burrell Jr. ordered that personal 
items seized when Kaczynski, a Berkeley mathematics professor, was arrested in 1996 should be sold at a 'reasonably advertised Internet auction' and the money recouped be distributed to the victims and their families.

Most of the items were taken from the Montana cabin - located in the wilderness of the Rocky Mountains - the Unabomber (university and airline 
bomber) had built and been living in for the best part of 25 years.

Auction items included the typewriter Kaczynski
used to compose the manifesto he sent to the New York Times and the 
Washington Post.

That manuscript fetched $22,003, while there were various items of clothing that had been worn by Kaczynski during his time in the countryside and while he organised and detonated the bombings.

Also on sale was the infamous hooded 
sweatshirt and sunglasses depicted in an FBI sketch of the Unabomber 
suspect, which sold together for $20,025.

Kaczynski's
personal journals sold 
for the highest amount: $40,676.

However, bomb-making materials, such as writings that contain diagrams and 'recipes' for bombs, were excluded from the sale.

The auctioneer 
paid the cost and will reportedly keep up to 10 per cent of the sale price.

In total, neo-Luddite Kaczynski, who said that technology was the reason he went on his killing spree, was ordered to pay $15 million in damages and interest to his victims, of which - even after this auction - only a very small amount has been paid.

And last week Judge Burrell last week
ordered the funds dispersed among two widows of men killed by 
Kaczynski, the wife of a man severely injured and an injured computer 
store worker.

The sums handed to the victims of the Unabomber, who mailed his homemade 
explosives to targets including airlines and universities, were as follows:

The U.S. Marshals Service and the 
General Services Administration conducted the online auction of 
Kaczynski's typewriter, sweat shirt and other belongings, which began on May 18.

'The U.S. Marshals Service has been given a unique opportunity to help the victims of Theodore Kaczynski's horrific crimes,' said U.S. Marshal Albert Najera of the Eastern District of California.

'We will use the technology that Kaczynski railed against in his various manifestos to sell artefacts of his life.

'The proceeds will go to his victims and, in a very small way, offset some of the hardships they have suffered.'
