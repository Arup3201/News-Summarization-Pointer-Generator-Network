One of the world’s most elusive big cats has been caught on camera in rare footage of it in the wild.

The Siberian tiger has never been filmed in the 50-year history of the BBC Natural History Unit.

But after six weeks of camping out in the world’s most hostile places, a team of scientists has filmed the carnivore for a new two-part series, Operation Snow Tiger, to be shown tonight.

The Siberian tiger is the largest cat in the world. It preys on deer, wild boar and grizzly bears.

It is the only tiger that survives most of the year in the snow. Despite its light orange coat and 
black stripes, it is difficult to spot, even against
a white backdrop.

However, the breed is under threat from poachers and there are now less than 350 left in the wild.

A Siberian tiger can fetch as much as £30,000 on the black market. The bones are sold for Chinese medicine and the skin is hung in homes as a status symbol.

The Siberian tiger once roamed across 
northern Asian. However, they now survive in a relatively small 
area in the far east of Russian Siberia, north of Vladivostok.

Tiger expert Liz Bonnin and a team of scientists travelled in -32C temperatures to gain new insight into the wilderness landscapes that are home to the carnivore for the series.

They filmed the tigers by fitting 30 small cameras to trees which activated when the animals passed. They also tracked them through deep snow and sub-zero temperatures by following giant paw prints.

She said: 'The Russian Far East is a 
spectacularly beautiful and extremely challenging environment to work 
in. It was a real privilege to work with scientists who rightly believe 
that losing the tiger from this landscape is simply unacceptable, and 
who work tirelessly to prevent its extinction against seemingly 
insurmountable odds.

'Every day brought thrilling discoveries and 
harrowing moments, and the tigers certainly kept us on our toes at every
turn. This was an adventure that will stay with me forever.'
