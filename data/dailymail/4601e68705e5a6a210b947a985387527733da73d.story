With World Cup fever due to grip the nation in a couple of weeks time, 
it seems that British men will make some serious sacrifices to watch their team in action.

The boys, including Joe Hart, Steven Gerrard and Wayne Rooney, may struggle to get past the group stage but devoted football fans don't seem to care - 63 per cent are planning to watch one or more games anyway, found a new survey.

Perhaps unsurprisingly, men (77 per cent) are more likely to 
watch a match than their female counterparts (44 per cent).

Big audience: A new survey has found that 63% of Brits are planning to watch England including, from left, Steven Gerrard, Glen Johnson, Joe Hart and Jack Wilshere, play in the World Cup

So keen are they to cheer their country to victory that over 20 per cent of British men would miss a funeral, wedding or even the birth of their child to watch the World Cup.

The research also found that 28 per cent would miss an important work commitment and 28 per cent would skip a holiday.

One male respondent, who took part in the research, said: 'If I had an England ticket to the 
World Cup final, I would miss my own wedding, let alone a friend’s.'

Highlighting the importance of the beautiful game, England midfielder Adam 
Lallana went as far as to wed his fiancee, formerly 25-year-old Emily 
Jubb, six months early to avoid his wedding clashing with the World Cup.

That's devoted! So keen are they to cheer their country to victory that over 20 per cent of Brits would miss a funeral, wedding or even the birth of a child to watch the World Cup

The
Southampton captain, who fathers their one-year-old son Arthur, was 
meant to walk down the aisle today but married his girlfriend of seven 
years in a £500 ceremony at Poole Register Office in Dorset on Christmas
Eve.

A spokesperson for DatingPriceGuide, who commissioned the research, said: “It seems the World Cup is as 
popular as ever, especially if people are willing to risk the wrath of a
 family member after missing a wedding or partner for missing the birth 
of their child”

'Let's hope for everyone’s sake, England prove their doubters right!'
