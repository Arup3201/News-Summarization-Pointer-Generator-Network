It's an irrefutable truth. Nothing goes better with eggs than bacon.

But the perfect pairing? Finding Hollywood actor Kevin Bacon serving up some eggs in your kitchen. 

The American Egg Board seem to have cracked it by running a series of online and print advertisements featuring the affable A-Lister.

Kevin Bacon stars in the American Egg Board's newest online and print advertising campaign

The video features scenes of a housewife leaning in to sniff Kevin Bacon as he lies on her kitchen counter 

The Hollywood actor shunned the silver screen for his latest role, opting instead to pick this straight-to-web offering.   

The short video, filled with bacon puns, shows that the actor doesn't take himself too seriously.  

The highly entertaining tongue-in-cheek advertisement opens with a woman making scrambled eggs for breakfast when Kevin Bacon appears in her kitchen, lying suggestively across the counter.

The hilarity kicks off as he then spouts a string of mirth-inducing puns.

And the memes have started...

Come here for your Bacon: The tongue-in-cheek advert last for two minutes and is filled with puns 

'Nobody knows eggs better than Bacon,' he says, smouldering suggestively.

He then goes on to wax lyrical on the goodness of eggs as the woman listens wide-eyed and breathless.

'You know I love the smell of bacon in the morning,' he says as he takes the plate of eggs away from her.

'And I like the smell of Bacon,' she states, as she leans in to sniff the Footloose actor, just as her husband walks in. 

The meta advert – at one point the actress says 'you sound like a commercial' – has been wildly praised for its tongue-in-cheek approach to eggs.

The American Egg Board said it's the first time the group is using a Hollywood celebrity in a major marketing push.

But which bacon are they talking about here? The ad is full of funny moments like this 

 The online campaign is supported by print advertisements which also reference the star's last name 

The campaign comes at an opportune moment; eggs which were long shunned and viewed as high-cholesterol are now back in vogue in the fickle world of food fashion due to their high protein content.

Bob Krouse, CEO of Midwest Poultry Services, an egg producer in Mentone, Indiana, said  that he's glad the egg board is taking a slightly edgier approach in its marketing.

Mr Krouse said: 'I always felt like egg farmers were too conservative.'

The 'Wake Up To Eggs With Bacon' push by the ad agency Grey is an update on the 'Wake Up To Eggs' campaign that launched in 2012.

'With a last name like Bacon, I'm the obvious choice, and I'm excited to be a part of the new Incredible Edible Egg campaign,' the actor said. 

'I like the creativity behind the idea, and I've always been a big fan of eggs.' 

The egg and Bacon pairing has been received with delight byTwittersphere. 

The Project TV made a joke of its own: 'There is now officially only one degree of separation between Kevin Bacon and eggs.'  

User @diannenice said: 'Is there nothing @KevinBacon can't do?

Radio station K-Rock tweeted: 'Can anyone tell us why this took until 2015 to happen?'
