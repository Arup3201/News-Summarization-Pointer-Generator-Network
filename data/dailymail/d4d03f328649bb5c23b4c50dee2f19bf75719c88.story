It is a dark day for the World Wide Web.

The popular YouTube clip that for years has tricked people into watching a Rick Astley music video is no more - the video titled 'RockRoll'd' has been removed from YouTube.

It's unclear why the video was removed.

The concept of 'Rickrolling' is basically sending a person a link to something that appears interesting or relevant. But it is actually just a disguise - when the person clicks on the link, it takes them to Astley's uber-cheesey music video for his 1987 song 'Never Gonna Give You Up.'

SCROLL DOWN FOR A CONGRESSIONAL RICKROLL

The trick was called 'Rickrolling,' and it became in incredibly popular Internet phenomenon.

The clip amassed nearly 71 million views and YouTube, and managed to find its way into pop culture, with celebrities and even politicians 'Rickrolling' people.Â 

In 2009, then-speaker of the House of Representatives Nancy Pelosi released a video on Congress' YouTube hub, which was in its infancy at the time, titled 'Speaker Pelosi Presents Capitol Cat Cam,' which was billed as 'a behind the scenes view of the Speaker's Office in the U.S. Capitol.'

The video showed several cats roaming around Pelosi's office. About halfway through the video, viewers get Rickroll'd with Astley's video.

In 2008, Astley participated in the first live Rickroll at the Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade.

During the live Rickroll, Foster's Home for Imaginary Friends characters were singing 'Best 
Friend,' the theme from the 1970s TV series The Courtship of Eddie's 
Father.

In the middle of the song, Astley emerged from inside the float to Rickroll the audience with a lip-synched performace of 'Never Gonna Give You Up.'

According to Billboard.com, it is unlikely that Astley is the reason the video was removed - since 'he did not write the hit song, he likely would not have played a role in
 its removal,' the website says.
