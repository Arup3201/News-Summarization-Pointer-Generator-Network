On screen they are usually portrayed as mortal enemies, but a cat that was dying after eating rat poison was saved thanks to a blood transfusion - from a dog.

The rare operation was carried out by New Zealand vet Kate Heller, who realised that Rory the cat would not survive unless he was given an immediate blood transfusion.

Unfortunately his blood type was not known and to have performed the delicate operation with the wrong type of blood - which for cats falls into categories A, B or AB - could have proved fatal.

But decisive action was imperative because without it Rory was in equal danger of using up the last of his nine lives.

Rory's owner Kim Edwards rushed him to Tauranga Vets after she heard him howling in pain and unable to move.

When she got there she found the blood laboratory was closed and it was not possible to determine Rory's 
blood type.

After consulting colleagues, Miss Heller decided to take a chance and perform the operation on the sick feline using dog's blood.

She said: 'If
 we didn't do it, he would have died, so we had nothing to lose by 
giving it a go. It was a do or die, but it's very 
uncommon.'

Studies have shown that cats might 
not have such an adverse reaction to it no matter what the type, than 
they might to the wrong type of cat blood.

Miss Heller, of Tauranga, told the Bay of Plenty Times: 'Inter-species blood transfusions are not common, nor are they recommended.'

Miss Edwards called a friend from her book club who owns a pet Labrador called Macy.

She agreed to letting her dog be used for the transfusion.

According to Miss Heller, Rory had been 'really flat and 
gasping and howling' before the operation.

But the transfusion worked so well that an 
hour after the transfusion he was purring and tucking into a bowl of 
biscuits.

Miss Edwards said: 'The vets just went above and beyond. It's 
incredible that it worked.

'Rory is back to normal - and just for the record we don't have a cat that barks or fetch the paper!'
