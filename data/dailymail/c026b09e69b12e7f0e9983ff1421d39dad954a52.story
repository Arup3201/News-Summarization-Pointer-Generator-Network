This pooch may be small in stature but proves size is no barrier to wreaking havoc on a party.

As two men are getting an outdoor entertaining area in Limassol in Cyprus ready for a celebration, the puppy decided to get the games going early.

The black dog sank its teeth into the most colourful decoration it could find - a long line of bunting - and led the two men on a not-so merry chase.

The puppy darted under tables and chairs that had been laid out for the party to keep away from his masters.

The men appear keen to avoid hurting the puppy and further damaging the bunting as they chase the dog from side to side.

After a little over a minute the puppy's game was over, and unfortunately for the men so was the bunting.

Can't catch me: The puppy weaved in and out of tables and chairs in the outdoor area 

Too elusive: Two men chased the puppy but only catch up with her when she's done with the game

The little pooch is too elusive for the man and a friend to catch

The men, in Limassol, got the bunting back but not in brilliant condition
