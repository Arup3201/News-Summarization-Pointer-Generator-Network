The selfie stick was so 2014; this year will be all about the much more bizarre Belfie Stick.

That's what one company will be hoping anyway, with their new device for smartphones.

If you're confused by the name, don't be; the 'b' is for behind and, yes, this is a stick that helps you take a picture of your rear end.

US company On.com has revealed a selfie stick for your backside. Called the Belfie Stick (shown) it has an extendable arm and a hinge. This allows you to get the optimum angle to snap an image of your behind. A Bluetooth button at the end of the stick lets you easily take photos

The Belfie Stick, from US company On.com, lets people more easily take a picture of their behind using a bendable design.

Evolutionary scientists claim the male attraction to a large female bottom is due to an ingrained preference for women with a small 'waist to hip ratio.'

The waist-hip ratio is calculated by dividing the waist measurement by the hip size. The smaller the waist in relation to the hip, the more attractive a woman appears to a man.

The study found that fat around curvy hips and thighs holds higher levels of omega-3 fatty acids, which are essential for the growth of the brain during pregnancy.

Reporting in the journal Evolution and Human Behaviour, the researchers found that the children of curvy mothers are more likely to do well in cognitive tests than others. 

The extendable and adjustable arm, with a hinge in the middle, helps amateur photographers get the perfect angle without needing to use a mirror.

At the tip of the stick is a Bluetooth button, which can be synced with your device to activate the shutter on your camera.

And almost all smartphone users will be able to bask in the joy of the Belfie, as it supports Android, Windows and Apple devices.

'With our bendable stick, you can position your back side without the need of a mirror and shoot the exact angle you are looking for,' the company explains on their website.

'Bend in ways you never thought possible with our patent-pending design!'

The product will be available later this year and is expected to retail for £53 ($79.99).

And who knows - perhaps, before long, this will be the latest inexplicable craze sweeping the world.

The Belfie Stick is reminiscent of the currently popular selfie sticks, but it has a hinge in the middle to help you get a better angle on your behind. The product will go on sale later this year for £53 ($79.99) and supports Android, Windows and Apple devices

Perhaps the most famous 'belfie' of all time is this picture of  Queen of Curves Kim Kardashian

No one's looking at her hair! Kim's husband Kanye's ex Amber Rose is one of few who can match Mrs Kardashian-West at her belfie game

Another fan of suspicious belfies is former reality TV star Lauren Goodger who posted this on her Instagram

On.com's chief technology officer Kevin Deegan said the reason for the product's creation came from a belfie trend being noticed in their online photo galleries.

'Our users are our biggest indicator of selfie trends being that it's the type of photo they post most often,' he said.

'We've noticed a huge spike in users taking butt selfies in recent months so the natural next step was for us to develop a device to assist our users in taking one.' 

The selfie stick, shown here, is becoming a regular fixture among normal social activities like BBQs, holidays, sports events and parties, sometime to the annoyance of others - but is it about to lose its status as the most frustrating recent invention to the Belfie stick?
