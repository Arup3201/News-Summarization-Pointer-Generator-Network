Two gipsies who beat a farmer to death with a crowbar after they found little worth stealing at his home have been jailed for life.

Frankie Parker, 26, and his uncle, Gary Smith, 21, struck pensioner Llywelyn Thomas over the head and stamped on him during a raid at his £500,000 home in Chittering, Cambridgeshire.

The pair, who were staying at a nearby travellers’ site, fled with ornamental eggs, a wallet, watches and a Rover 75, part of  Mr Thomas’s classic car collection.

Police search: The camp in Chesterton, where the gipsy burglars were living

But they dumped the car four miles away after realising it could not go faster than 20mph.

Yesterday Smith laughed and smirked throughout proceedings as he and Parker were jailed for life at Cambridge Crown Court.

Widower: Llywelyn Thomas, 76, was found dead in his home in Cambridgeshire the next day

During the 17-day trial the court 
heard that the men – described by police as career criminals – could not
resist boasting to other members of the travelling community about what
they had done.

Witnesses said Parker bragged about ‘smashing an old man’s face right in’ and leaving it ‘twisted’.

The pair had forced their way in to 
the converted chapel as widower Mr Thomas watched Strictly Come Dancing 
on December 17, 2011.

They restrained him and searched his 
home for valuables.

Afterwards they ‘set about a savage beating’, said 
Karim Khalil, prosecuting.

‘He did not stand a chance.’

The attack was so ferocious he would 
have died within minutes.

The court heard that Parker had been annoyed 
at getting ‘a pretty poor return’ on the burglary and launched the 
horrific attack.

Bernard Tetlow QC, defending Smith, said Parker was trying to feed a £70-a-day amphetamines habit that made him aggressive.

Parker will serve at least 24 years 
after being found guilty of murder.

Smith was given a minimum of 22 
years for the same offence.

Viciously attacked: Mr Thomas died within minutes after being so savagely beaten

Passing sentence, Mr Justice Singh said Parker and Smith had ‘shared an intention to kill’ and had shown Mr Thomas no mercy.

During the trial it emerged that 
Smith had been jailed for five years for a similar attack on a 
73-year-old woman during a burglary at her home in Kilham, East 
Yorkshire, in February last year.

He had battered the pensioner with her own walking stick before stealing her car.
