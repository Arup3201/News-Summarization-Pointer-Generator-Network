A federal prosecutor is under investigation after allegedly posting 'racist' comments about Trayvon Martin on a private Facebook page.

Assistant U.S. attorney John Craft reportedly made culturally snide remarks about the 17-year-old shooting victim in an online discussion about 'Stand Your Ground' laws.

Anonymous screenshots sent to The Beaumont Enterprise reportedly show the veteran prosecutor referencing watermelon, 'purple 
drank' and Robitussin - all of which refer to derogatory anti-black stereotypes.

'How are you fixed for Skittles and 
Arizona watermelon fruitcocktail (and maybe a bottle of Robitussin, too)
 in your neighborhood?' Craft reportedly wrote.

'I am fresh out of ‘purple drank.’ So, I may come 
by for a visit. In a rainstorm. In the middle of the night. In a hoodie.
 Don't get upset or anything if you see me looking in your 
window...kay?' 

MailOnline has not seen the screenshots.

Martin wore a hooded sweater and carried Skittles and an Arizona-brand drink, when he was fatally shot by neighborhood watchman George Zimmerman on February 12, 2012, in Florida.

The Texas prosecutor also allegedly wrote that 'low information voters carried the day for the Dalibama in the last election.'

He also allegedly posted a graphic titled 'Obama: Why Stupid People Shouldn't Vote.'

The graphic and description have not been made available to the media, but were reportedly seen by The Beaumont Enterprise.

Craft said his remarks 'were not related to the U.S. Attorney's office', and refused to comment further.

However U.S. Attorney for the Eastern District of Texas, John Malcolm Bales, said he will 'look into' the derogatory comments, which he found 'reprehensible'.

'It speaks ill of our office in connection,' Bales said. 'We don't think like that. We don't act like that.'

He said his office did not have a social media policy and the almost 5,000 U.S. attorneys were entitled to their opinions of public issues.

Craft rose to prominence as the U.S. attorney who prosecuted bank robber John Steve Stark, the so-called 'Handsome Bandit', last year.
