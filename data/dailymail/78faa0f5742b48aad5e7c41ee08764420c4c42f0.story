Luke Donald or Lee Westwood? The man who has never lost a foursomes match on European soil or the rock of so many Ryder Cup victories? The man with a brilliant singles record and the only player to have competed in four Ryder Cups and never been on a losing side; or the golfer who is an inspirational figure both on the course and in the team room?

That, I believe, should be the incredibly difficult choice facing Europe’s captain Paul McGinley on Tuesday on what promises to be an intriguing wildcard occasion on both sides of the Atlantic. For McGinley, it’s a High Noon in every sense with his three-card trick being broadcast to the nation at midday, while his opposite number Tom Watson’s choices follow on around midnight (UK time).

Let us start with McGinley, and the four players in the frame for the three precious spots: Ian Poulter, Stephen Gallacher, Donald and Westwood. On paper, you would go for the three Englishmen every time, and never mind that the match is being played 34 miles from Gallacher’s home at Gleneagles. The trio have got the Ryder Cup medals to prove it, and few captains ever bestow a pick on debutants.

Tough to split: Paul McGinley may have to choose between Lee Westwood and Luke Donald for the Ryder Cup

Tough choice: Donald is among four Brits in the running to make captain McGinley's Europe team

Out of form: Veteran and Cup inspiration Westwood isn't in good touch coming into the clash with the USA

But the problem McGinley faces is the palpable fact that all three Englishmen are hopelessly out of form. Poulter has garnered fewer world ranking points this year than any other player in the top 40 except the injured Tiger Woods. Westwood did not even make the top 100 who were eligible for the second FedEx Cup event that finished in America on Monday night, while Donald has not had a single high finish all summer.

Going into a Ryder Cup with a quarter of your team misfiring to this extent in regular tournaments would surely be placing far too much value on experience over form and constitute a gamble veering towards the reckless.

Gallacher, meanwhile, has gathered more world ranking points than Donald and Poulter combined. The match is being played on European soil and in his last four European starts he has finished tied fourth, tied 15th at The Open, tied seventh, and third at the Italian Open on Sunday. He finished so close to making it by right - just 1.16 points behind ninth-placed Graeme McDowell -it’s no wonder there is such a clamour for McGinley to make an exception in this instance and bestow a wildcard on a rookie.

Rookie: Scotland's Stephen Gallacher has more world ranking points than Donald and Poulter combined

WILDCARD CONTENDERS 

Age: 38. 

Ryder Cups: 4.

This season: Disappointing doesn’t begin to cover it, with injuries playing a big part.

Why he should be picked: Seriously? After what happened at Medinah?

Why he shouldn’t: Inconceivable that Captain McGinley wouldn’t pick ‘Mr Ryder Cup’.

Age: 41. 

Ryder Cups: 8.

This season: Top-15 finishes at two majors and a win in Malaysia.

Why he should be picked: Never let Europe down in all those eight matches.

Why he shouldn’t: Can he still hole the big putts when vital points are on the line?

Age: 36. 

Ryder Cups: 4.

This season: Runner-up in PGA Tour event  and tied third in Europe’s flagship event.

Why he should be picked: Europe’s best putter and wonderful Ryder Cup record.

Why he shouldn’t: Coming off the most disappointing summer of his career.

Age: 39. 

Ryder Cups: 0.

This season: Wonderfully consistent, and beat McIlroy to win in Dubai.

Why he should be picked: Fabulous ball striker, and hometown hero.

Why he shouldn’t: Lacks experience. Can he handle the unique atmosphere?

There is one other factor that ought to be considered as well, for you do not have to be a rabid advocate for Scottish independence to wonder what effect it would have on the atmosphere if McGinley went for three out-of-form Englishmen over the hometown hero.

Alongside Gallacher, the case for Poulter is unanswerable. How could you possibly leave out the man who has won his last seven Ryder Cup matches and turned the last contest at Medinah in Europe’s favour almost single-handedly? Just to complete the picture, Poulter was playing average golf going into previous Ryder Cups and still delivered.

So that leaves Donald or Westwood. Waiting for Donald is the perfect foursomes partner in his great friend, the revitalised Sergio Garcia. Waiting for Westwood would be 11 team-mates who all look up to him and recognise his contribution to Ryder Cup lore.

Helping Westwood’s case is the fact one of McGinley’s assistant captains is Sam Torrance. He is one of Westwood’s closest golfing buddies and already on record as saying he believes he should be in the team.

In the hot seat: McGinley will make his call on the final three wildcards for Europe on Tuesday

EUROPE

Already qualified: Rory McIlroy, Henrik Stenson, Victor Dubuisson, Jamie Donaldson, Sergio Garcia, Justin Rose, Martin Kaymer, Thomas Bjorn, Graeme McDowell. Three wildcards to be added.

USA 

Certainty: Keegan Bradley. Probable: Hunter Mahan. Possibles: Webb Simpson, Chris Kirk, Brandt Snedeker, Russell Henley. Already qualified: Bubba Watson, Rickie Fowler, Jim Furyk, Jimmy Walker, Phil Mickelson, Matt Kuchar, Jordan Speith, Patrick Reed, Zach Johnson.

But the thing that might prove pivotal in this marginal decision is the fact Westwood has shown glimpses of his true form this summer. There was a special round of 63 to close out the Bridgestone Invitational at Firestone and three rounds in the 60s - including one of 65 in the first round - at the US PGA Championship. From Donald, alas, the magic has been missing.

Still, leaving out the match play specialist, and perhaps the best putter in European golf? One thing is for certain: whoever gets the call will be under immense pressure to justify his selection.

As for the Americans, Watson has had a good three weeks following his embarrassing uncertainty regarding Tiger Woods, when even a fool could see Tiger was not in any fit state to play. Since then, Keegan Bradley has stepped up to the plate and will resume his formidable partnership with Phil Mickelson, as has Hunter Mahan, who will be burning to make amends for his fatal mistake against Graeme McDowell in their singles match at Celtic Manor in 2010.

Regarding the third spot, that could well be determined by events at the Deutsche Bank Championship in Boston late last night, where a clutch of young Americans had the ideal opportunity to impress against Rory McIlroy.

It should be some Wildcard Tuesday.

QUOTE OF THE WEEK

‘I don’t think he needs a swing coach. If I were advising him, I’d tell him: “You’re the greatest player that ever lived, just go to the range and hit shots”.’

Butch Harmon, the best coach Tiger Woods ever had, offers some sound advice in the wake of Tiger’s not-so-shocking split from his most recent guru, Sean Foley.

Second chances in life are rarely so profitable or joyous as Colin Montgomerie’s on the senior circuit. 

An overwhelming 10-shot triumph at Woburn on Sunday in the Travis Perkins Masters was his third victory of a season that has also seen him claim two senior majors and has taken the 51-year-old Scot’s earnings to loose change short of $2million. 

By my calculations, that places him just above the amount mustered by Justin Rose for seventh place in the Race to Dubai.
