Photojournalist Michel du Cille, a three-time Pulitzer Prize winner who recently captured compelling images of Ebola patients and their caretakers, died in Liberia while on assignment for The Washington Post. He was 58.

Executive Editor Martin Baron sent a statement to the newspaper staff informing them of du Cille's death. Baron called du Cille 'a beloved colleague and one of the world's most accomplished photographers.'

Du Cille found himself at the center of controversy when in October Syracuse University pulled an invitation for du Cille to attend a fall workshop for its communications school after a student raised concerns that he'd recently been in West Africa covering the Ebola crisis.

Du Cille insisted he had been symptom-free for the three weeks since his return and said he was 'embarrassed and completely weirded out' by the university's decision.

'The most disappointing thing is that the students at Syracuse have missed that moment to learn about the Ebola crisis, using someone who has been on the ground and seen it up close,' he said.

'But they chose to pander to hysteria.'

The Post reported du Cille collapsed Thursday while returning on foot from a Liberian village where he'd been working on an assignment.

He was taken over dirt roads to a hospital two hours away and was declared dead of an apparent heart attack.

Du Cille won two Pulitzer Prizes as a photographer with the Miami Herald in the 1980s and shared a third in 2008 as a reporter with the Post — an investigative public service series on the treatment of veterans at Walter Reed Army Medical Center who were returning from Afghanistan and Iraq. 

He won his first Pulitzer for their coverage of a volcano eruption in Colombia in 1985.

His second Pulitzer was won for work documenting life inside a crack house in Miami, which revealed the devastating effect it had on the local community.

'He was a courageous witness and a powerful storyteller,' said Kenny Irby, with the Poynter Institute in Florida to The Washington Post.

He also spent several years as The Post's director of photography and an assistant managing editor.

The experienced photographer frequently featured those suffering deprivation as the subjects of his work.

He traveled to Sudan and Afghanistan for assignments and came under fire while working in the war torn countries.

Du Cille also covered the civil wars that raged in Liberia and Sierra Leone that broke out in the 1990s and then finally, the Ebola outbreak in Africa.

'It is profoundly difficult not to be a feeling human being while covering the Ebola crisis,' Mr. du Cille wrote in The Post in October. 'Sometimes, the harshness of a gruesome scene simply cannot be sanitized. . . . But I believe that the world must see the horrible and dehumanizing effects of Ebola.

'The story must be told; so one moves around with tender care, gingerly, without extreme intrusion.'

He returned to West Africa this year to cover the Ebola outbreak, sometimes wearing heavy rubber gloves as he took the pictures of the patients. 

Loss; Michel du Cille with his second wife, Nikki Kahn, who also is a photographer at the Washington Post

Born in 1956 in Kingston, Jamaica, du Cille moved with his family to the state of Georgia in the 1970s, where he began his career as a photographer at the Gainesville Times. 

He graduated from Indiana University in 1981 and received a master's degree in journalism from Ohio University in 1994.

He is survived by his wife, Post photographer Nikki Kahn, and two children from a previous marriage. 

Arrangements were being made to bring his body to Monrovia, Liberia's capital, Information Minister Lewis Brown told The Associated Press on Friday.
