A supermarket Christmas pudding has beaten the best that Harrods and Fortnum & Mason have to offer in blind taste tests.

The £3.99 ‘M Signature Jewelled Fruit Christmas Pudding’ from Morrisons was the cheapest of 11 premium puddings tested by experts for the consumer group Which?

However, it was scored 85 per cent by a panel of judges including the 2013 winner of the Great British Bake Off, Francis Quinn, and food critic Charles Campion.

The £3.99 ‘M Signature Jewelled Fruit Christmas Pudding’ from Morrisons was the cheapest of 11 premium puddings tested by experts for the consumer group Which? but it also scored the most highly

The panel eulogised about its having a ‘great depth of flavour’ and being ‘simply majestic’.

By contrast, the experts described the £10 St James Christmas Pudding from Fortnum & Mason as having an 'artificial flavour' and compared the taste to a citrus bathroom cleaner.

The Extra Special Mulled Port and Orange pudding from Asda, costing £5, scored lowest – at 48 per cent - and was criticised for its unpleasant, chemical flavour.

Each pudding was given a mark out of 10 for appearance, aroma, taste and texture

Which? asked supermarkets and upmarket retailers to nominate a premium pudding for the taste test by experts, who also included the award winning artisan baker, Patrick Moore, and Oliver Whitford-Knight, owner of The Pudding Bar.

Each pudding was given a mark out of 10 for appearance, aroma, taste and texture, which was converted to a percentage and then given a ranking.

Which? also tested both champagne and sparkling wine and found quality does not necessarily come at a high cost.

Sainsbury’s Blanc de Blanc Brut Champagne at £22.50 a bottle came joint top of the champagnes, scoring 80 per cent, sharing the accolade with Piper Heidsieck Brut Champagne at £33.

The best Prosecco on offer came from a Co-op own label at £9.99 with the judges praising its balance of bitterness and fruitiness.

Which? editor, Richard Headland, said: ‘Christmas can be an expensive time of the year so it’s satisfying to see our festive taste tests revealed some of the cheapest were also some of the best. 

'Time and again, we find supermarket own labels giving the big brands and high-end retailers a real run for their money.’
