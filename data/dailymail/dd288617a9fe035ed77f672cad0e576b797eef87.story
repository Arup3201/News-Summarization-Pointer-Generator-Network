Sportswear firm Nike suspended its contract with the athlete yesterday

Visitors to the home of Oscar Pistorius were left in no doubt of his need to feel safe.

This picture shows the silver 9mm pistol he kept on the bedside table next to his car keys, designer watch and remote controls.

It emerged yesterday as the case against Pistorius descended into farce. The detective leading the inquiry was replaced after it was revealed that he has been accused of attempted murder.

The gun was pictured in 2010 during a magazine photoshoot at the Blade Runner’s Pretoria home, where last week he allegedly murdered girlfriend Reeva Steenkamp.

It is not known if it is the gun Pistorius used to kill the 29-year-old model, whom he says he mistook for an intruder.

Firearms expert David W Dyson said yesterday that it looked like a semi-automatic 9mm Taurus parabellum, the type recovered from the scene.

In his affidavit presented to his bail hearing Pistorius, 26, said: ‘I’ve received death threats. I sleep with my 9mm under my bed.’

The athlete applied for firearms licenses for six more weapons weeks before the shooting.

Pistorius, who is accused of premeditated murder, will learn today whether he has won his fight for bail as he awaits trial.

Yesterday South Africa’s top detective was put in charge of the case after Detective Hilton Botha, who had led the investigation, was removed. It emerged that Botha and two other officers are accused of opening fire on a minibus full of passengers.

Police said charges of attempted murder against Botha had initially been dismissed but were reinstated before he was called to Pistorius’s flat after Miss Steenkamp was shot in the early hours of Valentine’s Day.

Botha, who has been accused of bungling the case, will be replaced by Lieutenant General Vinesh Moonoo.

National Police Commissioner Riah Phiyega said the Pistorius investigation would now be handled at a national level.

Police Brigadier Neville Malila, of the South African Police Service, said he learnt only on Wednesday that the charges against Botha, dating from 2011, were active again.

Accusations: The prosecution claim it was a premeditated murder, but his defence advocate has argued there is no evidence to suggest the athlete's account of events is untrue

He said they were reinstated before Miss Steenkamp’s death and could not explain why Botha, who has not been suspended, had been given the lead role in South Africa’s most high-profile murder inquiry.

Botha, a police veteran of 24 years, had been embarrassed and ridiculed in the witness box in the packed Pretoria courtroom on Wednesday as he gave confusing and conflicting evidence.

He was accused of contaminating the crime scene in Pistorius’s house and had to backtrack on details such as how far away witnesses were when they heard screaming, shouting and gunshots.

His discomfort continued yesterday as he denied he had been drunk when he opened fire on the minibus and said the incident happened when he and fellow officers had been chasing suspects.

Questioned by defence lawyer Barry Roux, Botha conceded that Pistorius’s version of events – that he fired into the toilet door in a panic thinking an intruder was lurking behind it – was plausible.

He admitted that telephone records from the night of the shooting, including those of Miss Steenkamp, had still not been obtained.

It led to magistrate Desmond Nair observing there appeared ‘a lack of urgency’ in the police case.

Mr Roux stressed: ‘The poor quality of evidence presented by the chief investigating officer exposed disastrous shortcomings in the state’s case.’

Mr Nair had earlier asked: ‘Do you think there will be some level of shock if the accused is released?’ Mr Roux responded: ‘I think there will be a level of shock in this country if he is not released.’

Last night the Pistorius family appeared optimistic. The athlete’s uncle, Arnold Pistorius, said the Paralympian, who has spent long periods of the bail hearing sobbing with his head in his hands, was eating again after six days and had spent much of his time in custody reading the Bible.

In a clear sign of a change of mood, Pistorius was composed in the dock, with none of the tears of previous days.
