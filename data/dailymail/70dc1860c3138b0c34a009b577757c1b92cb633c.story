Last Friday, News Corp reported that security documents on Nauru revealed it was 'probable' that Save the Children staff working on Nauru were encouraging asylum seekers to self-harm.

Ms Young has alleged the information from the report was provided by Morrison staff to to the News Corp journalist.

The article alleged the recent claims of sexual abuse from Nauru guards were 'fabricated', and that the instances of self-harm on the island were being encouraged by Save the Children Aid workers.

It comes after reports of unrest and self harm on Nauru detention centre, with multiple detainees stitching their lips together and large scale protests being staged on the compound.

Last week, there were further reports that woman and children on Nauru had been sexually assaulted by guards.

The guards had allegedly threatened refugees with rape after they left the compound, offered illicit substances in exchange for sex, and made them expose themselves in order to have longer showers.

Ms Hanson-Young has accused Scott Morrison of leaking information when reports of unrest and abuse from Nauru are rife

'Information seems to be leaking from the office of the minister and his department at suspiciously convenient times,' Ms Hanson-Young has told Fairfax.

 'Disclosing privileged information is a serious breach of the Crimes Act and I've asked the AFP to get to the bottom of what's going on.

'If the minister's office has been involved in a breach of the Crimes Act, I expect the full force of the law to be applied.'

An AFP spokesperson told Daily Mail: 'The Australian Federal Police (AFP) received a referral on 7 October 2014 from Senator Sarah Hanson-Young in relation to this matter. 

'The AFP will evaluate this referral as per usual process.'

'While this process is ongoing it would not be appropriate to comment further.'
