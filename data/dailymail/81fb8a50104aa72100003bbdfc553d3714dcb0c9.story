Horrific death: Medical employee Pelagia Zingatan, 65, died after being hit by a New York taxi and dragged along the street

A woman has died after she was hit and then dragged along the street by a New York cab, according to police.

Pelagia Zingatan, 65, who worked at a medical center on the Upper East Side of Manhattan was crossing the street with a friend when a taxi minivan plowed into her on Monday afternoon. 

Ms Zingatan was dragged along the street under the back tire, bystanders said, before the vehicle came to a halt. 

Her friend had managed to jump out the way of the vehicle.

Those standing on the street, a group of around 15 people, lifted the vehicle off the woman and pulled her from under it. 

One
witness began giving her first aid as the driver of the cab looked on.

He had no passengers in his minivan at the time and although no criminality was originally suspected, there were now suggestions that the driver may have been speeding.

Ms Zingatan was taken to New York Cornell Hospital where she died, authorities said.

The Philippines native, who lived in Queens, worked at 
Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center and was crossing 69th Street at First 
Avenue when the fatal accident happened around 1pm.

Andreas Andreou, a local restaurant manager who was at the scene, told the New York Post: 'They pulled her out, and somebody started giving her compressions.

Good Samaritans: Those who witnessed the accident at East 69th Street and 1st Avenue rushed to lift the vehicle off the woman's body

A cousin of the deceased Feliz Araneta, 72, told DNAInfo that Ms Zingatan was a 'loving and kind person' and that her ashes would be returned to her native Philippines to the family's church.

The 65-year-old is also believed to be survived by eight siblings in her home country.
