You'd be forgiven for thinking that the images in Michael Fennell's collection are photographs, yet not only are the realistic pieces of art in fact paintings, they are created using smoke.

These smoke paintings are produced using large
 canvases suspended above Fennell’s head and as he holds the candle close 
to the canvas, the charcoal particles in the smoke hit the surface and 
form marks.

His canvases feature musicians, novelists and sport stars, among others, and sell for between £3,000 and £5,000 each.

Artist Michael Fennell uses candles and smoke to create paintings in his Lake District studio that so realistic they are mistaken for photographs. The 43-year-old suspends metre-tall canvases overhead and uses flames like brushes to 'paint' using carbon particles in smoke. His canvases feature musicians, such as conductor Sir Robert Norrington, pictured, novellists and sport stars, among others, and sell for £3,000 to £5,000 each

Fennell was introduced to Sir Norrington, pictured, through a friend in a string quartet. He said: 'Roger liked the idea of the originality of my work and said 'Let's just go for it'

Fennell became interested in smoke as a medium around 15 years ago after seeing a monochrome image that had been created by a plume of smoke.

Having previously worked with oil, he told MailOnline he was also inspired by the marks left by charcoal and ink on his studio floor.

‘I saw the mark the flame had made [on the floor] and I was struck by how freeform it was. The mark almost resembled water, even though they’re very different materials. It couldn’t be created by anything else; a splash or scratch couldn’t create it and it was this unique nature that interested me.’

As well as moving the candle, Fennell said he uses different objects, such as card or his hand, to move the smoke and achieve different textures.

Although he admitted there was, and still is, a lot of trial and error when working with the airborne medium.

Yet Fennell believes this just adds to the overall effect, and makes the style unusual: ‘Everyone who sees them always asks how they’re done,’ explained Fennell, ‘which suggests to me that it’s unique.

'When paintings are labelled with just the word 'smoke', it hides a lot from the process' and he thinks this further adds to the mystery.

Fennell is keen to keep a number of his processes a secret, yet told MailOnline that one thing he has learnt from using smoke is that the paintings must be ‘fixed.’

‘Initially the canvases were framed behind glass, but the glass was suspended in front of the surface. The
 painted smoke is fragile and even the lightest of touches can affect 
it.

'When the paintings are kept in the studio, there have been times 
when the lights have attracted moths who have hit the canvas and 
disrputed the work. That shows how delicate it is.’

The
 science of trying to fix it with different aerosols, moisture and so on
 has added to the development of the pieces, added Fennell, and this gives the images ‘a sense of mystery.’

Rather than paint subjects in real-time, Fennell said he works mainly from his memory, using aides to guide him. Fennel said: ‘It’s the nature of the work that the paintings evolve and the likeness can come and go as each project progresses. I do use photographs, but I’m not a slave to them. He added: ‘I like the other arts, I love music and literature. There’s a portrait of William Boyd, pictured left, and I read most of his books before I met him.' Boyd, pictured right, is an award-winning British novelist

Many of the portraits are painted onto canvases a metre tall. Fennell explained that because of the movement and nature of smoke, paintings need to be big in order to manage the medium. Fennell's Amelia Earhart painting, left, appears to ‘glow because it’s got a very dark background and it’s such a contrast,' said the artist. This means it translates particularly well into a photo.’ Amelia Earhart, pictured right, is shown in her iconic jumpsuit with Fred Noonan in Los Angeles, May 1937

‘It’s the nature of the work that the paintings evolve and the likeness can come and go as each project progresses. I do use photographs, but I’m not a slave to them’ adding that the health and safety elements of working with flames and smoke make life drawing difficult.

Fennell added that many of his designs are inspired by his other interests: ‘I like the other arts, I love music and literature. For example, there’s a portrait of William Boyd and I read most of his novels before I met him.I produce adverts for jeweller Theo Fennell and he was friends with Boyd. Boyd had seen my work behind the scenes and I got to know him.

Fennell said he is fascinated by the movement and fragility of the smoke on a canvas, as seen in this painting of ex-rugby player Matt Dawson

'He was pleased with the finished portrait and to flatter me, he said he admired my draftmanship.’

Similarly, Michael Fennell was introduced to conductor Sir Roger Norrington through a friend in a string quartet.

‘Roger liked the idea of the originality of my work and said ‘Let’s just go for it’. We then worked through some sketches so I was pleased with the movement of the piece.

‘I use sketches because I like to visualise the end results’ continued Fennell, but he added because of the smoke's volatile nature and upredictability ‘happy accidents happen that you can never really know about beforehand.'

Fennell also takes commissions and his canvases sell for between £3,000 and £5,000 each.

Many of the portraits are painted onto canvases a metre tall. Fennell explained that because of the movement and nature of smoke, paintings need to be big in order to manage the medium.

He is often asked if they will fade, but he reassures his clients of their light-fastness and durability having developed a successful fixing agent.

Their longevity is more guaranteed than that of more traditional media such as watercolour and acrylic.

‘The first marks [in caves by our prehistoric ancestors] were done with natural pigments and I’m pretty sure they would have used burnt and crushed bones to make the marks. They may have even used an oil lamp.

'All mark making is made with things to hand, burnt items, pigments and so on. These ancient works haven’t disappeared, so my paintings have an assured permanency.’

When asked how the paintings appear to glow, Fennell said that this is partly to do with the contrast between black and white, and partly to do with the production of the photographs.

The Amelia Earhart painting for example ‘glows because it’s got a very dark background and it’s such a contrast.

‘This means it translates particularly well into a photo viewed on a modern, high-tech computer.’

He continued that in the flesh, they do have more depth: ‘The smoke creates a prismatic effect that rakes across the surface. Slight changes and fluctuations in the carbon, even to a nanomillimetre, can be picked up by the eye and this adds more to the paintings than a photograph.’

Looking forward, Fennell said he is experimenting with other airborne materials, in particular gold pigment. 'I’ve started using small amounts of pigment in my work to add another element of shimmer and depth. I sprinkle it and it floats onto the surface.'

He’s also recently been working on an advertising campaign, again with Theo Fennell, which features strong female heroines.

‘The paintings form a narrative piece to go with the jewellery. I can’t reveal too much about the project but it is based around strong female identities.‘

Describing the medium Fennell said: ‘Smoke is unique; is not drawn, painted, printed, rubbed, flicked, blown or sprayed on. It can create the most beautiful blacks, that are 'luminous' and have depth to the extent that charcoal is flat and pale next to it. It can also create melting, nebulous edges and a great range of tones to rival those of photography.’

‘Smoke as a drawing medium is of course fundamentally flawed - it is tremendously volatile and a line cannot be drawn with it, but perhaps more importantly you can easily ignite your paper and burn down your studio!’
