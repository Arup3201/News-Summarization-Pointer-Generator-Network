Rare bitterns are bouncing back with the highest number of 'booming' males recorded since the nineteenth century, wildlife experts said.

The elusive heron-like birds, which were driven to extinction in the UK, have been helped by European conservation measures which have supported the restoration and creation of wetland habitat that they rely on, the RSPB said.

The bird, prized as a medieval banquet dish and hit by hunting and the loss of its reedbed habitat as wetlands were drained, became extinct in the UK in 1886.

The shy, well-camouflaged bitterns are hard to spot, but mating males can be counted from their loud, distinctive boom-like call which carries several miles across marshland

It managed to recolonise the Norfolk Broads in 1911, but while numbers rose until the 1950s they then crashed once more to a low point in 1997.

The shy, well-camouflaged bitterns are hard to spot, but mating males can be counted from their loud, distinctive boom-like call which carries several miles across marshland.

The latest survey has revealed there were 140 booming males across 61 sites in 2014, up from just 11 males at seven sites in 1997.

More than a dozen of the sites where bitterns were counted this year are current or former gravel pits, brick pits or open coal mines where reedbeds have been restored, showing the importance of recreating habitat at quarries and other such spots, the RSPB said.

New reedbed habitat for bitterns has also helped other species, ranging from water voles to white egrets and rare small dotted footman moths.

The RSPB credits the EU's Life-Nature programme for supporting it and other organisations to recreate wetland habitat. The wildlife charity also said EU protections for birds have helped by requiring the UK Government to take action to boost bittern numbers, designating and ensuring habitat is properly managed for the birds.

Funding from the Life-Nature scheme allowed the creation of more than 300 hectares (740 acres) of new reedbed, an area about the size of the City of London.

In addition, more than 350 hectares (860 acres) of habitat were restored across 19 sites.

This year, the highest number of bitterns recorded were at RSPB Ham Wall, inland marsh habitat in Somerset where 20 males were booming. The RSPB said Somerset now had England's largest bittern population.

But concerns have been raised that the EU conservation laws which have helped species such as bitterns could be weakened by the new European Commission.

Martin Harper, director of conservation at the RSPB, said:' Thanks to protection under European laws and key partners working together, bittern numbers have been gradually climbing since 2000.

'Bitterns needed conservation on a country-wide, landscape scale and without the support of the EU's Birds Directive, which protects all European wild birds and the habitats of listed species like the bittern, this would not have been possible.

'The bittern success story should give hope that it is possible to recover threatened species and that it makes sense to protect the laws that protect nature.'

Environment Secretary Elizabeth Truss said: 'The bitterns distinctive 'booming' call is just one way in which it is a truly special bird, and I'm delighted that future generations will have a chance to hear it.

'This success is down to the hard work of the conservation organisations, landowners and Government agencies who worked together to improve and create new reedbeds for bitterns to breed in.'
