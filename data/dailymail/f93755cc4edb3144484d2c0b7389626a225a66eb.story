A solar-powered family car has completed a drive from Los Angeles to San Francisco fuelled entirely by sunshine - a journey covering almost 385 miles (619km).

Called Stella, the vehicle can travel up to 500 miles (800 km) on a single charge, clocking speeds of up to 80mph (130 km).

The prototype four-seater has solar cells on its roof to provide power while driving, and it boasts a tablet that tracks traffic lights.

A lightweight, wedge-shaped electric car called Stella (shown) that charges itself with solar cells on its roof has been built at Eindhoven University. It travels 500 miles (800km) on a single charge at speeds of 80mph (130km/h). This distance is increased if the sun is shining thanks to the array of solar panels on top

The vehicle was created by a group called Solar Tam Eindhoven, based at Eindhoven University of Technology in the Netherlands.

Stella's recent journey took it up California's scenic Pacific Coast Highway into the centre of L.A.

Stella can travel up to 500 miles (800 km) on a single charge, at speeds of 80mph (130 km).

The 1.5-kilowatt solar panels on top of the car, which cost about £2,600 ($4,260) to produce, supply power to the car's lithium ion battery

At the back of the car, the panels can be lifted up to reveal a boot, and other novelties include a steering wheel that expands when a user drives too fast, and contracts when they drive too slow.

It weighs 855lbs (390kg) and is 15ft (4.6 metres) long, while the body of the vehicle is made of carbon fibre. Its aerodynamic shape also helps to increase its driving range.

But the car is less than 4ft (1.2 metres) tall, so getting in is a bit of a squeeze.

Stella can even communicate with other cars; during an example, it relayed traffic information to a Tesla Model S nearby.

And this extends to traffic lights as well - a tablet screen in the car will tell the driver how long until a light up ahead turns red or green. 

And the creators of Stella hope their vehicle might one day enter mass production, and become a common sight on roads.

The car also features smart technology, including a tablet that shows the driver when traffic lights will change colour (pictured). It can also 'talk' to other cars

'It was great to see all the people looking at us; hurrying to get their smartphones out to get pictures while we were driving,' said Lex Hoefsloot, manager of Solar Team Eindhoven after the car had undertaken its drive from Los Angeles to San Francisco.

In July a team of University of New South Wales students broke a 26-year-old world record for speed, which would make their solar car the fastest electric vehicle to travel 500km on a single battery charge.

The car, which was built by Australia's top solar car racing team - UNSW's Sunswift - was able to travel at an average speed of more than 100km/h, beating the previous world record of 73km/h.

The world record was broken on a 2.6 miles (4.2km) circular race track in Geelong - south-west of Melbourne - in Victoria at the Australian Automotive Research Centre.

The vehicle to smash the record, eVe, was the fifth one built and raced by Sunswift since the team was founded in 1996. 

'I think we caused some traffic jams and we were worried some drivers might run into us while trying to take pictures.'

Hoefsloot is one of the students at Eindhoven University of Technology who designed and built Stella in what grew into a school-wide project that won a World Solar Car challenge race across Australia in 2013.

Stella launched a US tour in Detroit at the Intelligent Transportation Society World Congress in early September.

The team drove to San Francisco to join sponsor NXP Semiconductors of The Netherlands in an event focused on a future in which roads are made safer and air pollution reduced by cars that 'talk' to one another as well as traffic signals. 

'We think it is possible to make these cars and have them in a showroom in five to 10 years, but it is a big dream and something we have to really work on,' said Hoefsloot. 

The technology in Stella is not new and if the solar cars were mass-produced like gas-guzzling models they could be similarly affordable, according to the student.

But big auto-makers have had little contact with the team because 'they think it is too far-fetched,' Hoefsloot told AFP.

'We think otherwise, of course,' he said.

'It is the first family car that is powered by solar energy, it just doesn't have a family yet.'  

Stella also has a steering wheel (pictured) that expands if a users drive too fast, and or contracts if they go too slow. The car is a prototype at the moment but recently completed a drive from Los Angeles to San Francisco
