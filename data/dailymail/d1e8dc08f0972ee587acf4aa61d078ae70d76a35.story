A force has taken delivery of the world’s fastest police car in a bid to slow motorists down - although it won’t actually be going out on the streets.

Avon and Somerset Police Force is using the 350bhp Ariel Atom as part of a campaign to encourage motorcyclists to curb their speed.

Based on the latest Atom 3.5R, the car has the latest aerodynamic Hella pursuit lights and emergency equipment.

The £38,000-car can reach 62mph in just 2½ seconds and a variant of the model holds the lap record at the Top Gear test track.

That makes it faster than the Lamborghini Gallardo LP560-4 Polizia used by Italian police, the Audi R8 GTR driven by officers in Germany, and a Ferrari FF used in Dubai.

Avon and Somerset Police has borrowed the Atom from local manufacturer Ariel for the summer while it promotes its new campaign, Safer Rider.

It is 
hoped the eye-catching machine will dissuade bikers from riding 
dangerously as it is displayed at promotional events across the 
southwest.

Seven motorcyclists have lost their lives already this year in the area, a 30 per cent increase on this time last year.

Andy Parsons, a Roads Policing Sergeant with the Tri Force Specialist Operations Collaboration, who is heading the campaign, thinks that the Ariel Atom will be just what they need to promote safer riding.

‘I am really excited that Ariel has joined with us to bring Project Safer Rider to fruition, and I hope that the use of the Ariel PL1 with have a positive impact to promote Road Safety in line with our PCC's Priorities, and help us to reduce road death and serious injury,’ he said.

‘To be safe, rider and machine need to work in harmony. When this happens it feels immediately right. When it doesn't, things go wrong. Too many injuries and deaths are the result of rider error.’

The Atom has been unveiled as the number of motorcyclists on the road increases drastically over the summer months, with 20 per cent of all deaths on UK roads involving bikers.

Motorcyclists are also 35 times more likely to be killed in a road collision, something that the campaign hopes to reduce.

Simon Saunders, the director of Ariel said: ‘Our business is about going fast, very fast, but there is a time and a place. The Atom is designed to be driven to a race track, where you can drive to your limits in safety and in a professional environment designed for the purpose.

‘The road really isn't the place to explore your or your vehicle's limits.’ 

The new car will be unveiled to the public on June 8 in Somerset alongside a host of other police vehicles, with the day also offering training and information for bikers.

The vehicle, which weighs just 612kg and has a top speed of 155mph, will not be used in operational police duties.
