A forgotten Magna Carta manuscript which could be worth up to £10million has been discovered in a Victorian scrapbook in a Kentish town's archive.

It has been hailed an important historical find in the week the four original copies were brought together for the 800th anniversary of the charter which established the principle of the rule of law.

The parchment, discovered in Sandwich's archive, was ripped and a third had been lost, but experts were able to establish it was issued by Edward I in 1300.

Speaking from Paris, Professor Nicholas Vincent, of the University of East Anglia, who authenticated the document, said: 'It is a fantastic discovery which comes in the week that the four other known versions were brought together at the Houses of Parliament.

A forgotten Magna Carta manuscript which could be worth up to £10million has been discovered, pictured the four original surviving copies were brought together for the first time at the British Library

King John signed the Magna Carta at Runnymede, near Windsor, in June 1215 – a moment hailed as one of the most significant in English history

'It is a fantastic piece of news for Sandwich which puts it in a small category of towns and institutions that own a 1300 issue.'

Archivist Dr Mark Bateson discovered the historical document  at the Kent County Council history and library centre in Maidstone.

It is one of only 24 editions of the Magna Carta in known existence around the world.

Professor Vincent said the fact Sandwich had its own Magna Carta means that is may have been issued more widely than previously thought to at least 50 cathedral towns and ports. 

'And it is very likely that there are one or two out there somewhere that no one has spotted yet,' he said.

More than 40,000 people entered a public ballot for the chance to see the four surviving original Magna Carta copies, but only 1,215 will get the opportunity

The medieval history expert said the value of the Sandwich edition could be up to £10million. 

The first Magna Carta was agreed between King John and the barons in 1215 and was reissued on many occasions.

Dr Mark Bateson found the document in December when he was asked to look up a copy of the town's original Charter of the Forest.

It was found next to the charter in a Victorian scrapbook and its high value comes from the fact it also comprises the Forest Charter. 

There is only one other such pair in the world, owned by Oriel College, Oxford.

It is understood that Sandwich does not intend to sell its Magna Carta but instead is hoping to benefit from its potential as a tourist attraction.

Paul Graeme, mayor of Sandwich Town Council, said: 'On behalf of Sandwich Town Council, I would like to say that we are absolutely delighted to discover that an original Magna Carta and original Charter of the Forest, previously unknown, are in our ownership.

'To own one of these documents, let alone both, is an immense privilege given their international importance.

'Perhaps it is fitting that they belong to a town where Thomas Paine lived, who proposed in his pamphlet Common Sense a Continental Charter for what were then the American colonies, 'answering to what is called the Magna Carta of England ... securing freedom and property to all men, and ... the free exercise of religion'.

'Through the American Declaration of Independence, continuing in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, Magna Carta still underpins individual liberties worldwide.

'To own such a document - and the Charter of the Forest - is an honour and a great responsibility.'

The four known 1215 editions are from Salisbury Cathedral, Lincoln Cathedral and two held at the British Library.

They were brought together for a one-day exhibition at the British Library Parliament for a crowd of 1,215 chosen by a public ballot.

Speaking of the exhibition, the Lord Speaker, Baroness D'Souza, said: 'Magna Carta established the principle of the rule of law and equality before the law; for 800 years we have been influenced by its contents and it remains one of the most important political documents in the world, with countries such as the United States, Australia, New Zealand and Canada tracing constitutional influences back to Magna Carta.'

The Speaker, Rt Hon John Bercow MP, said: 'Over the past eight centuries the public and their Parliament have shaped society and changed the way we live our lives.

'The sealing of the Magna Carta in 1215 and the Montfort parliament of 1265 marked the start of the journey towards modern rights and representation, paving the way for the House of Commons and democracy as we know it today.'

The parchment, which was issued by Edward I in 1300, is the final version of Magna Carta and three of its clauses remain on the statute books today.

These include the defence of the church, the protection of the City of London and the right to trial by jury.

The first Magna Carta was drafted by the Archbishop of Canterbury and agreed by King John on 15 June 1215 to make peace with a group of rebel barons. 

It was reissued and reaffirmed on many occasions in subsequent years.

Eight centuries after King John sent copies of the first Magna Carta across his kingdom, just four remain.

Two of the survivors are kept at the British Library, were they lay alongside the other two copies which are usually found at Lincoln and Salisbury Cathedrals. 

The two British Library copies came from the private library of the MP and and antique collector Sir Robert Cotton, whose collection of preserved documents laid the foundation for the library back in 1753.

One of these manuscripts was almost destroyed in a fire in 1731, suffering some damage but remaining largely intact.. Staff at the British Museum Library in the early 19th century also made it harder to read by using outdated techniques to flatten and mount the historic document. 

The Salisbury Magna Carta has been at the Cathedral since the 13th century. It may have been deposited there by William Longespée, Earl of Salisbury and one of King John’s chief advisers, or it may have come from Elias of Dereham, who supervised the building of the Cathedral from the 1220s.

The manuscript has rarely left the Cathedral in its 800 year history.

The Lincoln Magna Carta has belonged to the Cathedral for 800 years. It is arriving at the British Library directly from the United States after going on display in Massachusetts and Washington, DC, where over 200,000 people viewed it. 

On its return to Lincoln, the manuscript will move from the Cathedral into a new permanent home at the ‘Magna Carta Vault’ in nearby Lincoln Castle.
