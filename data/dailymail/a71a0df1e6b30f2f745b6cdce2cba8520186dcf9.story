A university student was shot during a party at his frat house this weekend after the shooter was barred from going inside and tried to rob some of the members. 

The 22-year-old student, who has not been named, was shot during a fight which broke out in the early hours of Saturday close to Temple University in Philadelphia.

The man suffered a gunshot wound to the left thigh and was taken to Hahnemann University Hospital where he was treated and released.

The suspect approached a group outside the fraternity house and demanded to go inside but was told he couldn't because he wasn't a student. 

He then threatened to rob them and brandished a handgun that he had tucked in the waistband of his pants.

The victim tried to restrain the suspect and was shot, police said.

One student who ran to help the victim told NBC: 'I applied the pressure on his wound. I put both my hands right on his hip.

'Also some kid who was an EMT took out a sweatshirt and covered him up and then the officer showed up and carried him out.' 

Police were still hunting for the gunman today. He was described as African-American, 5'8'-5'9', slim and around 35-40 years old.

He was wearing blue jeans, a red hoodie, and red beanie hat and had no facial hair. 

MailOnline was awaiting a statement from Temple University on Monday.
