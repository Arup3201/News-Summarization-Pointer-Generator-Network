It's a familiar struggle most new mothers will be able to identify with - trying to get work done with a toddler in tow.

Whether it is simple tasks such as doing the washing or loading the dishwasher, everything seems to take longer with a little one running around.

Blogger Esther Anderson has highlighted 'Why Moms Get Nothing Done' in her latest video, filmed with her daughter Ellia, who takes delight in stopping her from doing her chores.

The video shows Ellia pulling clothes out of the drawers faster than her mother can put them away

The little girl then climbs into the drawer so she can reach the others to empty them

The amusing video, which has had more than 50 million views on Facebook, takes in a typical day at Esther's home in Florida, which she shares with husband Thad.

The footage shows Esther attempting to fold away Ellia's clothes and put them away in drawers in her room – only for the little girl to pull out the clothes faster than her mother can put them away. 

She then sabotages Esther's attempts to sweep the kitchen floor by spreading the dirt around again before her mother has a change to sweep it up in a dustpan. 

Sweeping the floor isn't a simple task for Esther as the video filmed in the Texas home shows

The little girl also rolls in the dirt for good measure in the video that has had 50 million views on Facebook

Then when Esther attempts to pack the dishwasher, Ellia throws dirty, plastic plates out of the bottom shelf while her mother tries to load the top shelf - the same thing happens when Esther tries to tidy up her daughter's toys as their bemused dog looks on.

And it's a similar story when she tries to load the washing machine as Ellia pulls the dirty clothes out before her mother can put them all in. 

A shot of Ellia rolling around in the garden in the mud and then covered in food when she eats reveals why Esther spends a lot of her day washing her daughter and changing her clothes.

The final scene shows Esther despairing of cleaning the windows as her toddler smears her dirty fingers and mouth over one side of the glass while her mother attempts to clean the other.

She also pushes the door closed before it's full to further hinder her mother's attempts to do the housework

Filling the dishwater is no simple task either as Ellia find it fun to through the plastic plates out

Esther said the many shares her video has had shows it's not just her who has trouble getting anything done thanks to having a toddler around as Ellia is here pictured closing the dishwasher before Esther has filled it 

Esther uploaded the video onto her personal website storyofthislife.com that charts her experiences and observations of motherhood.

One of her other videos reveals why co-sleeping means no sleeping for the mother and another asks viewers ;which type of mom are you?' showing how some mothers are obsessed with disinfecting their child's every move and not allowing them to touch something until it has been thoroughly cleaned first.

No wonder Esther spends so much of the day washing her daughter and changing her clothes

Many parents have agreed that Esther's video is an accurate reflection of motherhood

But Esther's video of her daily trials  getting 'nothing done' has been by far her most popular post.

She said: 'Fifty million views (on Facebook) in under 24 hours shows me that it's not just me that has this problem.'

Mothers rushed to share the video and agreed it was an accurate reflection of their own lives.

Commenting on the video's upload on YouTube, 'The Hippy Homemaker16' said: 'I think that every mom on the planet can relate to this,' while Ashley Carter said: 'This is exactly my life. I'm glad to know I'm not the only one!'

At the end of the video, Ester, who lives with husband Thad, despairs of cleaning the windows
