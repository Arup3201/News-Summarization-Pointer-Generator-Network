A Florida appeals court has overturned two of the four convictions that Casey Anthony faced for lying to detectives during the investigation into her daughter's disappearance in 2008.

While Anthony was acquitted of murder in two-year-old Caylee's death in 2011, she was convicted of four misdemeanor counts of lying to law-enforcement and sentenced to probation.

Judges on the 5th District Court of Appeals have now agreed with Anthony's attorneys that the charges constituted double jeopardy, or being convicted more than once for the same crime.

Victory: A court has overthrown two out of four convictions Casey Anthony faced for lying to detectives during the investigation into her missing two-year-old daughter, Caylee (right), in 2011

Jurors determined that Anthony lied when she told detectives that she 
worked at Universal Studios, that she had left Caylee with a babysitter 
who kidnapped the girl, that she had told two friends about her 
daughter's disappearance and that she had received a phone call from 
Caylee.

The state said each of her four false statements to detectives was a separate offense, but her attorneys said all of her lies only constituted a single offense.

The judge agreed the charges had constituted double jeopardy as the four lies had been made in the same interview.

'We cannot conclude that the Legislature 
intended to authorize separate punishment for each false statement made 
during a single interview,' they wrote.

Police questioning: Anthony, pictured in a waiting room in Orange County Sheriff's jail where her attorneys said she learned of her daughter's murder, told police four lies during questioning

But a second charge stands as she lied to detectives again on a later occasion, judges ruled.

The court said that she first made four false 
statements during her interview with Orange County 
Sheriff's Detective Yuri Melich at her home, theÂ Orlando Sentinel reported.

Two of these 
lies were then repeated to Melich in a later interview at Universal Studios, 
where Anthony said she worked.

'In light 
of the significant temporal break between Appellant's two interviews 
with Detective Melich, we determine that each interview in which false 
information was given (or repeated) constituted a separate criminal 
episode,' the court ruled.

The judges also ruled that the trial court was correct in allowing Anthony's statements to detectives to be used during her murder trial.

Loss: Among her lies, she said she had spoken to her daughter on the phone a day prior to the questioning

Ruling: Anthony, pictured with Caylee, then repeated the lies in a later police interview and enough time had passed for it to count as a second offense, a court has ruled

Her attorneys had argued that she was in police custody at the time and had not been read her rights.

'We conclude that a reasonable person in [Anthony]'s position would not believe "that his or her freedom was curtailed to a degree associated with actual arrest",' the panel ruled.

In response to the ruling, Anthony's 
attorney Cheney Mason said he was very happy that two convictions were 
overturned, and he would review the opinion on Monday to determine 
whether they need to seek clarification on the two other counts.

The next step for Anthony and her attorneys would be to appeal the remaining two convictions to the Florida Supreme Court.

It also means that Casey's civil trial involving a woman with the same name as the fictional nanny, Zenaida Gonzalez, can move forward. It had originally been set to start on January 2.

The civil trial is now tentatively scheduled for August, attorneys told Bay News 9.

Gonzalez, a Kissimmee woman who had never met Casey Anthony, is suing her for defamation, claiming her life was ruined after Casey said Caylee was kidnapped by a nanny with the same name.

Anthony was sentenced to a year of probation after her release from jail for an unrelated case.

Her whereabouts have been kept secret since she was released from state supervision last year, but a blurry cell phone image reportedly showed her eating at a South Florida steak house last month
