Charged: Donald Sachtleben was arrested for making the leak of classified information to an Associated Press journalist as well as the distribution of child pornography

A former FBI explosives expert has been charged with leaking the classified information about an upgraded underwear bomb involved in a foiled terrorist plot in Yemen.

The leak led to a second controversy as it was revealed that the Attorney General’s office seized the Associated Press’ phone records when they were trying to discover the reporter’s source.

Donald Sachtleben has plead guilty of revealing the information. He was also charged with distributing child pornography and now faces a total of 11 years and eight months behind bars for the two crimes.

The Justice Department said in a statement that its pursuit of Sachtleben was made easier by the child pornography investigation, but that Sachtleben was not identified as a suspect in the leaks case until after investigators had analyzed the AP phone records and compared them to other evidence in their possession.

The deal is the latest legal action in the Obama administration's aggressive pursuit of people it believes have revealed government secrets, including seeking records and even testimony of journalists who prosecutors believe were given classified information and then published stories about it.

The information Sachtleben gave to the AP revealed that American intelligence agencies had learned that al Qaeda’s  branch in Yemen hoped to launch a spectacular attack using a new, nearly undetectable bomb aboard a U.S.-bound airliner around the anniversary of Osama bin Laden's death.

The AP's May 7, 2012, story attributed details of the operation, including that the FBI had the bomb in its possession, to unnamed government officials.

Tracked: The appearance of Sachtleben's email on a child pornography site helped investigators look into him but so did the fact that he appeared on AP call logs that were seized by the Attorney General's office

CIA Director John Brennan has called the leak 'irresponsible and damaging,' while Attorney General Eric Holder said the story was the result of 'a very serious leak, a very grave leak.'

The intelligence officials argue that even though the terror plot had already been thwarted, by leaking the information it prevented the agencies from pursuing their leads further an potentially disrupting other planned attacks.

Just over a year after the story appeared, on May 10, the Justice Department informed AP that it had secretly obtained nearly two months of call records for more than 20 telephone lines used by AP reporters and editors, including some who worked on the story.

The news cooperative protested the government's actions as chilling to investigative journalism and the company and its reporters did not cooperate in the investigation.

AP chief executive Gary Pruitt called the records' seizure a 'massive and unprecedented intrusion' into how news organizations gather the news.

The court records do not identify AP or name the reporter who communicated with Sachtleben.

Controversial: Attorney General Eric Holder's office approved the seizure of a widespread collection of Associated Press and other news organization's phone records in searches for leaks by government agents

Sachtleben spent 25 years as an FBI special agent bomb technician and worked on major cases involving terrorist attacks, the government said.

He retired in 2008, but was rehired as an FBI contractor and kept his 'top secret' security clearance and access to the FBI lab in Quantico, Virginia.

In court papers, Sachtleben said he visited the FBI lab on the morning of May 2, 2012, at the very time that FBI experts were examining the bomb. Sachtleben shared that information with a reporter the same morning, the government said.

The AP story ran five days later, on May 7, 2012. The news organization had initially agreed, for several days, to the Obama administration's requests to hold off on publishing it.

The child pornography investigation did not become public until May 11, when the FBI searched Sachtleben's home and seized a Sony laptop from his truck in the driveway.

The FBI said it found 30 photos and videos of child pornography on the computer and Sachtleben was arrested the same day.

The government said it began investigating Sachtleben for child pornography after an email address linked to him popped up on a known child-porn web site.

Admitting guilt: Sachtleben entered a guilty plea on Monday for both the leaking and child porn charges and he will face 11 years and 8 months in prison

Sachtleben apologized in a brief, three-sentence statement that his attorneys released on his behalf Monday afternoon.

'I am deeply sorry for my actions,' he said. 'While I never intended harm to the United States or to any individuals, I do not make excuses for myself.'

The Justice Department said it had already had in its possession, as part of the child pornography investigation, Sachtleben's cell phone, computer and other electronic media, including a CD/DVD containing classified information.

But the department said in a statement that it was able to link Sachtleben to the unauthorized disclosures about the Yemen plot only after investigators had analyzed the seized AP phone records and compared them to other evidence already in their possession.

Based on the analysis, they were able to get a search warrant for a new and more thorough look at his phone and computer, the department said.

Around the same time that the government told AP its phone records had been obtained secretly, court records were made public that showed that prosecutors had obtained a search warrant for the emails of Fox News reporter James Rosen.

The government says Rosen received secret information about North Korea from State Department adviser Stephen Kim, who faces criminal charges over the alleged disclosure.

Kim's case is among seven the administration has brought against people suspected of providing classified information, more than under all previous presidents combined.
