Jack Wilshere and Danny Welbeck looked focused as Arsenal trained prior to Tuesday's Champions League group stage clash against Borussia Dortmund.

Wilshere scored and played outstandingly in Arsenal's  2-2 draw against Manchester City on Saturday, while Welbeck enjoyed an encouraging debut before limping off with cramp. 

The former Manchester United striker looked to have recovered from the injury though as Arsene Wenger  put his side through their paces on Monday in preparation for the Gunners' match against the German side at the Westfalenstadion.

The Arsenal manager will hope Wilshere can carry on his good form, saying after the City match: 'He has found his pace back. That for a while was not the case. He finished with his right foot and chipped a goalkeeper who knows him well. For a long time, he did not kick the ball well because of his ankle.

'Now in training, he kicks the ball well and works on his finishing. His shot with his ankle is now clean again. He has found power back. He stays on his feet, which is the big difference. When he was not as confident, he would push on his ankle and go down on his body. He is more solid.'

Wilshere added: 'In the formation we play I should be scoring more. I've had a few chances this season. Hopefully that will be one of many. I want to go forward more.'

The Gunners head to Germany without  injured right back Mathieu Debuchy, who went off with a sprained ankle in Saturday's 2-2 draw against Manchester City, and could be out for up to two months.

Arsene Wenger looked deep in thought during the session, as he contemplated how best to find a solution for his threadbare defence.  

Arsenal beat Dortmund away 1-0 last season through an Aaron Ramsey header, and will be hoping for a repeat performance on Tuesday. 

Mathieu Debuchy went off on a stretcher in Saturday's 2-2 draw against Manchester City, and is expected to be out for two months with a sprained ankle

Wenger ponders his options, with the injury to first-choice right back Debuchy a major setback given the French manager's already limited defensive options

New signing Alexis Sanchez has scored in his last three games for the Gunners, and will hope to add to his tally against Dortmund on Tuesday

Arsenal's players train hard on Monday, knowing they will be in for a stern test against the German side, who reached the 2013 Champions League final
