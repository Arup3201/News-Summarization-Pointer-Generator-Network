UEFA has ordered Partizan Belgrade to play their next Europa League home game with a partial closure of their stadium after an anti-Semitic banner was displayed in their fixture against Tottenham.

The sign, based on the Only Fools and Horses logo, read 'Only Jews and Pussies' and was branded as unacceptable by Spurs boss Mauricio Pochettino after the game on September 18.

UEFA has acted and told Partizan that their next fixture against Besiktas will be played with the 'K' section of their stadium shut. The club have also been fined 40,000 euros (£31,430).

'The fight against racism is a high priority for UEFA,' said a statement.

'The European governing body has a zero-tolerance policy towards racism and discrimination on the field and in the stands. All forms of racist behaviour are considered serious offences against the disciplinary regulations and are punished with the most severe sanctions.

'Following the entry into force of new disciplinary regulations in June 2013, the fight against racist conduct has been stepped up a level - resulting in stricter penalties to deter any such behaviour.' 

There was a large police presence in the stadium despite only 150 Spurs fans making the trip
