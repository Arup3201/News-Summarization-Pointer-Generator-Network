Monday started out jubilantly for father-and-son running team Dick and Rick Hoyt as they posed for pictures with a life-sized bronze statue unveiled to commemorate their 31st Boston Marathon.

But, as for many runners, the happy day turned to terror at the 25-mile mark, and the inspirational pair were left confused, scared and unable to complete the race as they worried about loved ones who were waiting for them at the finish line.

'As we got closer, things didn't look right,' said Dick, 72, who has completed a total of 1,091 races while pushing his disabled son Rick, 51, in a special running chair.

Dick told Today.com that police were swarming the final stretch of the prestigious route so he asked an officer what was going on.

'He told me two bombs had detonated at the finish line,' the father said.

Those bombs, exploding around 12 seconds apart some 550 feet away from each other, claimed the lives of three spectators and injured 183, some gravely.

'That's when I got really worried. I knew my son and his wife and my two grandsons were waiting for us at the finish line,' Dick added.

Thankfully, their family escaped injury. But the chaos left the concerned Holland, Massachusetts, man wondering how to get Rick back to their hotel.

A police officer suggested they take a taxi but Rick's running chair is too big to fit in a cab.

That's
 when a a good Samaritan in a Jeep offered to give them a lift and, 
according to Today.com, managed to navigate their way through the 
blocked streets and frantic crowds to the entrance of the Sheraton.

Once Dick had carried his son to their room the magnitude of what happened began to sink in, he said.

'The thing about the Boston Marathon is that it's always such a joyful day,' Dick told the website. 'Everybody's so happy and it's such a positive attitude. And then to have this happen?...

'What kind of a world are we living in nowadays?'

Supporters of Team Hoyt have encouraged Dick and Rick, who has severe cerebral palsy and is unable to walk or talk, to run the final mile in the coming weeks, in commemoration of the bombing victims.

Long time: The father and son team have competed in more than 1000 races since the 1970s

Dick could never stop running with his son when 
Rick told his father: 'Dad, when I'm running, it feels like I'm not 
handicapped.'

But Dick believes that might be too soon.

'This
 isn't about us,' he said. 'If anything, we want to run the marathon 
next year to honor those people who were killed or injured this year. 
... We're hoping we can do that next year — we're getting old and all of
 that — but that's my feeling about it. We're just praying for those 
families right now.'

One thing is for sure. Dick is not 
going to let the tragedy prevent his family and friends supporting and 
enjoying their beloved Boston Marathon in future.

'We just have to move forward,' he said. 'We can't let something like this stop us.'

The
 truly special bond between the heroic father and his courageous son was
 honored with the statue after the inspirational pair finished 1,091 events, including 
252 triathlons, 70 marathons, 94 half marathons and 155 five-kilometer 
races.

A life-size bronze statue of Dick and Rick Hoyt will be unveiled April 8 at 10:30 a.m. in front of the Center Elementary School, near the starting point of the Boston Marathon

Despite being unable to complete Monday's race, the father-and-son team still maintained their proud 
record of never having finished last as thousands of other runners were also prevented from crossing the line.

Rick was born with cerebral palsy and is quadriplegic, the result of oxygen deprivation at birth.

At
 his birth, doctors were blunt. 'They said, 'Forget Rick, put him away, 
put him in an institution, he's going to be a vegetable for the rest of 
his life,' said Dick told the Today Show earlier this month.

'Today
 he's 51-years old and we still haven't figured out what kind of 
vegetable he is - and guess what? That vegetable has been turned into a 
bronze statue.'

The 
statue was unveiled outside Boston's Center Elementary School to honor 
Team Hoyts' racing record, which began in the mid 70s.

Never even thinking for a second to institutionalize their son, the Hoyt's decided to raise him like his two brothers.

They took him camping, cross-country skiing and swimming at the beach and enrolled him into school - where he learned to spell words with his eyes - one at a time.

He graduated from high school and also from Boston University and now lives on his own with personal care attendants.

It was while at school he told his father he would like to participate in a five-mile charity run for a Lacrosse player who had been paralyzed in an accident.

'Rick came home from that basketball game and he said, "Dad, I have to do something for him. I want to let him know that life goes on even though he's paralyzed. I want to run in the race," said Dick Hoyt.

Dick agreed to push his son in his wheelchair and they completed the run together.

Later that night, Rick told his father: 'Dad, when I'm running, it feels like I'm not handicapped.'

Rick Hoyt graduated from Boston University and discovered his passion for racing along with his father while he was at school in the 1970s

That sparked the creation of Team Hoyt, an astonishing feat of love and courage that has seen the father and son compete in more than 1,000 races, including marathons, triathlons and Ironman competitions.

During triathlons, Dick pulls his son in a boat from a cord attached to his waist during the swim, the pair ride a special two-seater bicycle for the bike section and Dick pushes Rick in a custom-made running chair for the final stage.

The incredible pair set up the Hoyt Foundation in 1989, which aims to include disabled young Americans into daily life, especially through sports, in school and in the workplace.

In 2009, they completed their 1,000th 
race together at the Boston Marathon, which is why the event holds such a
 special place in their hearts.

The two had a special wheelchair 
designed for them and Dick recalled how people didn't understand what 
they were trying to do together.

Heroes: Rick has cerebral palsy after being deprived of oxygen during his birth, but that has not stopped him taking part in more than 1,000 races

'I used to get letters and phone 
calls saying, 'What are you doing dragging your son to all these races? 
Are you just looking for glory for yourself?' Dick Hoyt recalled. 'What 
they didn’t realize was that he was dragging me to all these races!'

When
 asked the one thing he would like to give his father, Rick said: 'The 
thing I'd most like is for my dad to sit in the chair and I would push 
him for once.'

Both men now give talks across the U.S., as well as continuing to compete in events together in a bid to encourage other disabled young people to challenge themselves.

They have been competing as a team for more than 30 years, and their website says they have no plans on retiring.

Their schedule for 2013 includes 25 other races and for more information, visit www.teamhoyt.com
