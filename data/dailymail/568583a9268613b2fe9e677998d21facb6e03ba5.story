Jemima Khan yesterday revealed one of her teenage sons prevented a late-night break-in at her home.

The 40-year-old socialite said the burglars were ‘thwarted’ by his actions in the early hours.

Writing on Twitter, she told her 536,000 followers: ‘2am break-in, thwarted by son. Told not to put spikes on gate to prevent repeat as I’ll be liable if intruders get injured.’

She did not say which of her sons stopped the break-in or which of her homes was targeted.

Scare: Jemima Khan and her sons Sulaiman and Kasim

Last night a Met Police spokesman said no report of an attempted break-in had been received. It is not clear if the crime took place in London as Mrs Khan is known to have access to several properties.

She is understood to have one apartment in Fulham, south-west London, in a gated community where homes sell for around £3million.

Mrs Khan, who is now dating comedian Russell Brand, 39, has two boys - Sulaiman Isa, 17, and Kasim, 15 - from her marriage to former Pakistani cricketer turned politician Imran Khan.

The couple divorced in 2004 but she raised the teenagers, whom she has described as ‘painfully shy’, in the UK.

She subsequently dated actor Hugh Grant for several years before they split amicably.

Mr Khan, 61, claimed he ‘lost the will to live’ after the break-up of their marriage. He said not seeing his sons, then aged eight and five, caused him deep anguish, adding: ‘I loved fatherhood more than anything I had ever experienced in life ... now not having them around was the hardest thing to come to terms with.

‘For the first time I began to understand how people could lose the will to live. The children’s obvious distress exacerbated the misery.’

Writing in his book, Pakistan: A Personal History about his rise to political power, Mr Khan said: ‘My greatest sacrifice for being in politics was not always being able to spend as much time as I wanted to with my family.’

Mrs Khan, the eldest child of the late financier Sir James Goldsmith and his wife Lady Annabel, has kept her ex-husband’s surname and converted to Islam when they married.

She started dating Brand last autumn, and for the comedian’s 39th birthday on Wednesday she reportedly gave him a 24-carat diamond necklace spelling out the word ‘revolution’.
