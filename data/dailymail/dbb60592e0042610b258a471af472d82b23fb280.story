These are the stunning views from atop Britain – but you’ll need to be an expert climber with a head for heights and an appetite for danger to reach the country’s tallest peak in winter.

A group of brave mountain climbers captured these incredible images as they conquered the treacherous ice-covered rock face using ropes, spikes and crampons.

Their photos reveal the breath-taking beauty of the landscape surrounding the snow-capped peak of 4,400ft Ben Nevis in the western end of Scotland’s Grampian Mountains.

To get there, the climbers had to trek through the Minus Three Gully, which is tricky as the steep, narrow path is only accessible for the most experienced of climbers.

It is a challenging climb in fair weather but it becomes treacherous and fraught with danger when it is covered in snow and whipped by the frigid wind.

Daniel Wildey, an adventure and travel photographer and writer, took the photos as experienced climbers Tommy Kelly and Mike Pescod scaled the peak.

 It was Mr Wildey's first climb in Scotland and he says the scariest part was the 'sense of remoteness and isolation' in the Highlands

Daniel said: ‘Winter climbing has inherent objective dangers such as weather and conditions.

‘The climb itself is three to four pitches long and took maybe two hours, including lots of stopping for photographs.

‘Winter climbing requires specialist equipment - the obvious being crampons, stiff boots and technical ice axes.

‘Standard climbing gear is also needed, like ropes and harnesses, but another specialist piece is a rack of ice screws for protection.'

It took the group - Daniel Wildey, Tommy Kelly and Mike Pescod - around two hours to reach the peak of the mountain in Scotland

He added: ‘The clothing required to stay active and safe in Scottish winter condition is also very specialised.

‘I honestly don't remember what it was like reaching the top as I was so focused on shooting the photos.

‘All I know is the job wasn't finished until we were safely down.’

This was Daniel’s first climb in Scotland.

The 36-year-old, from Cumbria, said: ‘I've done a fair bit of mountaineering and ice climbing in the Alps and other mountain ranges but this was my first taste of Scottish winter.

‘I felt perfectly safe being with two highly experienced mountain professionals, but the scariest part was the surprising sense of remoteness and isolation you feel in the Highlands.

‘The picture of Tommy in the green jacket climbing out of the cave is the stand out feature of the climb.

‘The shot doesn't do justice to the difficulty of committing your swing out on to the face.

‘However, I think it does capture the feeling of trepidation whilst waiting for your turn.’
