Former primary school Martyne Airey, 51, pictured at an earlier hearing, sniffed and tickled children's feet - and he walked free from court

A primary school teacher who sniffed and tickled children's feet to get a kick walked free from court with a suspended sentence.

Martyne Airey, 51, made children play a game of ‘sniff and tickle’ where they had to take their shoes off and pick a card from a deck.

The court heard that depending on which card was picked he would then smell or tickle their soles, getting a sexual thrill out of sniffing sweaty feet in particular.

He was 
caught after teachers confronted children for being late to classes.

They explained that they had 
been with Airey and said what had happened to them.

After
 Airey was arrested, police found a voice recorder in his bedroom 
featuring a young boy reading a story about a woman who had been 
kidnapped, bound, gagged and was wearing dirty socks.

iPhone records showed that Airey, of Blackburn, Lancashire, had been visiting foot fetish websites.

Airey,
 who had worked as a teacher for around 18 years before he was 
suspended, pleaded guilty to eight counts of sexual assault on a child 
under 13 at Preston Crown Court.

He was sentenced to 15 months in prison – which was suspended for two years – and made to sign the Sex Offender Register.

At an earlier hearing, a parent of one of the children said his behaviour was weird.

'It was not normal behaviour. I was really angry and disgusted when it all came out.

Another said: 'You normally expect your children to be safe with a teacher, but this fellow obviously needs some help.’

Placing Airey on a two-year supervision order, Judge Newell said: ‘I can fully understand why any reasonable parent would feel affronted and distressed by what you, a teacher, have done to their children.

A judge at Preston Crown Court handed Airey a suspended sentence for two years and ordered him to sign the Sex Offender Register

‘Parents place great trust in teachers. They expect them to be looked after.

‘You abused that trust and it is a high degree of trust.’

In Airey’s defence, Tina Landale said her client was the carer for his elderly mother and brother.

‘Mr Airey sits before you a man with a reputation in tatters,’ she said.

‘He is ashamed of himself. He is disgraced and feels a great sense of revulsion as to what has happened.

‘He cannot really explain how he let himself become involved in this except to say that he enjoyed his teaching career, enjoyed the contact with the children.

‘He is described as a likeable teacher who got on well with people and for some inexplicable reason, he allowed himself to start playing this so-called game with a number of children at the school.’
