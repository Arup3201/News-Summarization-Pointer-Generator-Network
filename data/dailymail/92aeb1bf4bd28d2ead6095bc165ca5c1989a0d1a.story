The News of the World did not delete the voicemails of murdered schoolgirl Milly Dowler, the court heard yesterday.

Prosecutor Andrew Edis QC told jurors there was no evidence to back up reports in The Guardian newspaper that private investigator Glenn Mulcaire had deleted voicemails from the teenager’s phone after she went missing.

Incendiary claims that News of the World journalists erased the messages provoked public uproar and catapulted the phone hacking scandal into the spotlight.

The Old Bailey heard that the News of the World did not delete messages from the voicemail of Milly Dowler

But Mr Edis said the tabloid was not responsible for giving her parents ‘false hope’.

Prosecutor Andrew Edis QC told jurors there was no evidence Glenn Mulcaire deleted the messages

He said: ‘Milly Dowler’s mother, when 
she called her daughter’s phone, heard a different message and she 
thought that meant she might be still alive.

‘It was alleged that was the result of the deletion of voicemails by the phone hacker from her phone. There is no evidence for that at all.

‘No evidence that Mr Mulcaire ever deleted any voicemails from Milly Dowler’s phone.’

Timothy Langdale QC, representing Andy Coulson, also told jurors that the article published in 2011 was ‘pretty unjustifiable in a number of major respects’.

He said: ‘The report made allegations that the News of the World interfered with police inquiries, that News of the World journalists had deleted voicemails on Milly Dowler’s phone, to free up space for more messages.

‘There is no evidence to suggest that Mr Mulcaire or any other person from the News of the World deleted any message on Milly Dowler’s phone, either deliberately or accidentally.’

Jurors were shown pages from Glenn Mulcaire’s notebooks with the details he used to hack the phone of Milly Dowler.

The
page, with the name of ‘Neville’ in the top left hand corner, included 
the murdered schoolgirl’s parents names Sally and Robert, alongside 
their address, and a string of phone numbers.

Mulcaire,
whose notes were littered with spelling and grammar errors, had 
transcribed messages from friends pleading for the schoolgirl to get in 
touch.

Another entry included debit card details the police had used to top up the missing girl’s phone to ensure she could call if necessary.

Reporters from the News of the World seized on a message mistakenly left by a recruitment agency asking if a woman named Mandy wanted to come for a job interview.

But it later emerged the message had been left in error and was not meant for the missing 13-year-old.

Sorry we are unable to accept comments for legal reasons.
