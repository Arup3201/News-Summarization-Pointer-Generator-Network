Are you ready for one of the least likely fashion hits of summer?

Earlier this week, High Street fashion chain New Look announced that it has been selling 40,000 kimonos a week, beating other summer trends printed trousers and maxi dresses into second and third place.

The Japanese-influenced cover-up took off earlier this year as festival fashion, worn with fringing, cut-off denims and cowboy boots for a look that’s more boho than Edo.

Edo was the period in Japan from 1615 when the art of kimono-making was at its height and wives of wealthy merchants entered fashion contests to outdo each other with dazzling designs. Now they’re everywhere from M&S to House of Fraser and Zara.

I have a nostalgic affection for the kimono, and had a beautiful black ankle-length one (left) with red and gold embroidery I wore as a dressing gown in the Seventies until it started to unravel.

Then there was the simple cotton version  that I wore for several summers over flared  jeans. But when Boy George adopted the kimono as his signature style in the Eighties, I decided their time was up.

Until now. The kimono, far from just being festival fashion for Kate Moss wannabes, has a lot to offer. Bingo wings and lumps and bumps are instantly concealed. As a beach cover-up you can slip it over a swimsuit far more  discreetly than a kaftan that needs to be pulled indecorously over your head.

A short kimono is the perfect summer cardigan replacement and rather less old ladyish. And if you feel swamped by too much bulk, you can cinch your kimono with a belt.

To find out if I can still cut it in a kimono at 62, I put seven High Street styles to the test . . .

Paisley kimono, £20, boohoo.com Top, £9.99, hm.com J Brand jeans, £255, Trilogystores.com Shoes, £69.99, zara.com

I could imagine myself wafting around a rented villa in Morocco in this, although more likely barefoot than kitten-heeled. It would certainly be useful as a dressing gown.

SCORE: 4/5

Floral, £40, oasis-stores.com

Silk top, £95, reiss.com

Jeans, £40, topshop.com

Shoes, £95,  lkbennett.com

My
 favourite. Despite being closest in style to a traditional kimono, 
teamed with jeans and the silky  top it looks casual, modern and — dare I
 say it — trendy.

SCORE: 5/5

Floral kimono, £35.99, and leather skirt,
 £119, zara.com

Top, £29.50, marksandspencer.com

Belt, £69, reiss.com Shoes, £45, clarks.co.uk

I'd want less fringing, but this might make a
 twist on smart office wear. Belted, it adds a more feminine shape but 
shows you mean business. I’d prefer a more subtle print — it’s  too 
close to curtains.

SCORE: 2/5

Black kimono with embroidery, £35, asos.com Sandals, £175, russellandbromley.com Belt, £49, reiss.com

I’d wear this to a cocktail party. The embroidery at the back is beautiful and I can barely believe it costs just £35, it’s so elegant. But you need to dress it up with high strappy sandals and a waist-cinching belt to show what your figure looks like.

SCORE: 4/5

Mary Portas kimono, £69, houseoffraser.co.uk

Dress, £149, hobbs.co.uk

Shoes, £160, lkbennett.com

I love the cheery colour combinations, but I’ve ended  up looking like a
 frump. I’m not sure that kimonos should be worn over dresses. The 
overall effect is far too boxy. It looks like an oversized cardie.

SCORE: 2/5

Maroon tasselled kimono, £27.99, newlook.co.uk 

Top, £95, and trousers, £120, reiss.com

Shoes, £185, lucychoilondon.com

A
 good colour to take you from summer through to autumn, but it looks and
 feels a bit cheap. I like the tassels and pattern, but it’s 
see-through, so a carefully considered top underneath is important. I’d 
probably save this one for evenings.

SCORE: 3/5

Black-and-yellow, £45, motelrocks.com Trousers, £40, topshop.com Top, £9.99, hm.com Shoes, £55, marksandspencer.com

I’m taking this lightweight kimono on holiday in September. I can team it with whites while warding off the chill. It’s understated and flattering.
