Glass half full: Britons are cutting down on their drinking, according to industry figures (file photo)

Britons have dramatically reduced how much they drink, cutting back over the last decade by the equivalent of 110 glasses of wine a year or 73 pints of beer.

Drinking – at home as well as in pubs and clubs – has fallen by some 18 per cent since a peak in 2004, against a background of rising prices driven by inflation-busting increases in tax and duty, according to industry figures.

The fall calls into question the image of Britons as a nation of heavy drinkers and lager louts.

Indeed, the official handbook from the British Beer & Pub Association points out that UK drinking is an average of 25 per cent below the level in Germany and 15 per cent less than in France.

The fall appears to be part of a major cultural shift that has also delivered drops in alcohol-fuelled crime and vandalism.

The BBPA figures show drinking peaked in 2004 with annual consumption of 9.5 litres of pure alcohol. This is equivalent to 404 pints of 4 per cent beer or 604 small (125ml) glasses of wine.

There were falls in seven of the following nine years with the total down to 7.8 litres in 2013. That is equivalent to 330.8 pints of beer or 494.4 glasses of wine.

The figures, which use information from HMRC and the Office for National Statistics, cover pubs as well as shop-bought drinks. 

While the trends point towards a permanent change in attitudes for the research also shows that today’s teenagers are taking a far more adult approach to drinking than earlier generations.

In England in 2013, some 39 per cent of 11-15 year olds had never drunk alcohol, which was sharply down compared to 43 per cent in 2012 and 61 per cent in 2001.

Among those youngsters who had a drink in the last week, average weekly consumption was 8.2 units, which is equivalent to less than three pints of beer and is well down on the 12.5 units in 2012.

The fall in total consumption will be one of the factors behind the crisis facing the nation’s pubs with evidence showing that they are closing at a record rate of 31 a week, despite efforts to build trade by offering more and better quality food.

Change: The fall appears to be part of a major cultural shift that includes drops in alcohol-fuelled crime

The BBPA figures show drinking peaked in 2004 with annual consumption of 9.5 litres of pure alcohol, which is only a small proportion of the beer or wine in each glass. The 9.5 litres is equivalent to 404 pints of 4per cent beer or 604 small (125ml) glasses of wine - 11.6 a week.

There were falls in seven of the following nine years with the total down to an average of 7.8 litres in 2013. That is the equivalent to 330.8 pints of beer or 494.4 glasses of wine, which works out at around 110 fewer a year.

Price is likely to be major factor, for the cost of drink in Britain is among the highest in Europe after successive governments increased duty and tax at above the rate of inflation under pressure from doctors and the police as part of a policy to tackle binge drinking.

The current Chancellor, George Osborne, has rowed back a little on this by making cuts to beer duty. However, the UK still has among the highest drink taxes in Europe, which work out at around 53p on a pint of beer or £2.36 on a bottle of wine.

The BBPA’s chief executive, Brigid Simmonds, said: ‘Despite the recent cuts in beer duty, Britain’s consumers are still subject to some of the highest tax rates for beer in the EU. Let’s hope we see another tax cut next year.’

Shift in opinions: The drinks industry claims a more responsible approach to selling and marketing drinks

Earlier this year, the Government implemented a new policy requiring stores to stop using cut-price alcohol to tempt customers through the doors by introducing a new regime banning them from selling drink at less than the cost of duty plus VAT.

The drinks industry claims a more responsible approach to selling and marketing drinks, which was triggered over the rise of alcopops in the mid-1990s, has helped reduce problem drinking among the young.

In the 1990s and early 2000s, the sugary and powerful drinks like Hooper’s Hooch and Two Dogs triggered a wave of underage drinking. However, sales have since collapsed.

At the same time, the industry is now promoting a raft of lower alcohol options. For example, Jacob’s Creek and Blossom Hill are marketing wines with 5.5 per cent alcohol, while the Foster’s Radler and Carling Zest, which are just 2 per cent, are selling well.

Miss Simmonds said: ‘It’s great to see trends in alcohol harms coming down, showing that investment by the industry and partnership with Government, through targeted measures, is having a positive impact.’

The Campaign for Real Ale (CAMRA) has sounded the alarm over pub closures and has called for urgent changes to planning rules to help protect what are important community buildings.

Specifically, it wants to make it harder for supermarkets to buy and convert pubs into convenience stores.

Spokesman, Tom Stainer, said: ‘Popular and profitable pubs are being left vulnerable by gaps in English planning legislation as pubs are increasingly being targeted by those wishing to take advantage of the absence of proper planning control.

‘It is utterly perverse that developers are able to demolish or convert a pub into a convenience store or many other uses without any requirement to apply for planning permission.

'It is wrong that communities are left powerless when a popular local pub is threatened with demolition or conversion into a Tesco store.’
