A Philadelphia mother-of-four was fatally shot  while walking home from the store with her dog on Saturday night.

Kathryn Berry, 42, was on her way home from a corner store, walking her dog, near Fairmount Park around 8.30pm, authorities say, when she was shot once in the forehead and once in the thigh.

NBC 10 Philadelphia reports that an unknown heavy-set man between 5-foot-11 and 6 feet tall with a grey and black beard shot Berry with a silver handgun near the intersection of North 33rd and Morse streets before fleeing.

Investigators say that Berry was found by her daughter shortly after the shooting and was rushed to Hahnemann University Hospital in 'extremely critical condition.' 

Berry, a home health aide, was pronounced dead at around 4.20am on Sunday, according to NBC 10. 

Police say that Berry was the only one out walking at the time and, though they have no leads in Berry's death, it appears she was targeted by the killer.

A woman who witnessed the shooting, Brenda Mattier, told NBC 10 that, after Berry left the store, she began walking down the street where 'he was standing right there waiting for her and just shot her.' 

In an NBC 10 interview, a relative of Berry's, James Graves, described Berry as a 'dear, sweet woman' with a 'good heart.'

Berry's family told investigators that Berry never had any issues with anyone and they have no idea who could have killed her.
