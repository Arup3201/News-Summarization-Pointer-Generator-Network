For thirty years it has proudly rested beside the entrance of Leeds Art Gallery, giving visitors a glimpse of the stunning works to be viewed inside. 

But Henry Moore's Reclining Woman: Elbow sculpture was yesterday moved for the first time since it was erected outside the gallery's new extension in 1982.

The famous bronze figure - completed in 1981 - has been taken off its plinth to be loaned to the Rijksmuseum gallery in Amsterdam for a major exhibition of the artist's work.

It will join other sculptures and works by Moore as part of a unique exhibition to celebrate the reopening of the Rijksmuseum, which has undergone a 10-year refurbishment.

Castleford-born sculptor, who died in 1986, had close connections with the city after studying at the Leeds School of Art in the early 1920s.

Leeds City Council executive member for leisure, councillor Adam Ogilvie, told the BBC that Rijksmuseum's request to temporarily host the sculpture showed the international significance of the sculpture.

He added: 'It's going to be a little strange walking past the art gallery and not seeing the Henry Moore sculpture there as it has been a permanent fixture for the last 30 years, but it is long overdue a holiday after all that time.'

Renowned: Sculptor Henry Moore, who was born the son of a coal miner in Castleford - is still considered one of Britain's greatest artist of all time

The 7ft 3in long figure, which has become a well-known fixture of the Moore Sculpture Gallery extension, will be cleaned and renovated when the exhibition ends in September before being returned.

The artist - who was the son of a coal miner - was best known for his semi-abstract monumental bronze sculptures which are now located in public spaces in cities around the world.

His forms are usually abstractions of the human figure, typically depicting mother-and-child or reclining figures. Moore's works are usually suggestive of the female body, apart from a phase in the 1950s when he sculpted family groups.

His forms are generally pierced or contain hollow spaces. Many interpreters liken the undulating form of his reclining figures to the landscape and hills of his birthplace in Yorkshire.

Tower Hamlets Council caused controversy last year when they proposed to sell Moore's Draped Seated Woman - nicknamed Old Flo - for up to £20million.

Moore sold the sculpture to the then London County Council in 1962 at a reduced price of £7,000 as part of a regeneration scheme of the city after World War II.

The decision to sell was delayed in December while art heritage groups - including the Henry Moore Foundation - and campaigners - such as the director of the London 2012 Olympic Games Opening Ceremony Danny Boyle - challenged Tower Hamlets Council's right to sell the sculpture and demanded proof of ownership before it can be sold.

But the council decided to push ahead with the sale and Old Flo is now destined for a Christie’s sale in February.

It is believed the sculpture could fetch up to £20million after Henry Moore's Reclining Figure: Festival, built in 1951, sold for £19.1million in February despite being estimated as being worth £3.5 million to £4.5 million.

But a similar sculpture of a Draped Reclining Woman sold for significantly less in 2008 for £4.3million.

Moore is still considered one of Britain's best sculptures and was a trustee of both the National Gallery and Tate Gallery.
