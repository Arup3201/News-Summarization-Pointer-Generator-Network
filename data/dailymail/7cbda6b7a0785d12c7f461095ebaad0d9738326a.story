For those who are already married, most would know that organisation is key to planning a wedding and then there is the dreaded cost of a wedding. 

But a Sydney couple have decided not to worry too much about the big grand plan for their day, instead opting to stage a relatively casual affair with a pop up wedding.

It was in Sydney's CBD that school sweethearts Annie and Isaac Ledley held their wedding ceremony which was documented by bridal blog Hello May.

'We made sure there were no events around, and the restaurant in the alley was closed,' said Annie when they held their wedding ceremony in an alleyway

Equipped with giant-sized paper flowers, the pair took their group of guests to Angel Place, an alleyway in the city - unannounced and without the usual booking.

'It was actually my husband's idea, he wanted to have it on the Harbour Bridge but I didn't want to get arrested, so we scaled down and loved Angel Place,' Annie said.

'It's frustrating trying to organise outdoor weddings with all the restrictions. We took the risk, we like adventure and are always thinking outside the box.'

Annie said they did not have to pay any councils fees for the ceremony on Sunday and they were done in about 10 minutes. 

'We made sure there were no events around, and the restaurant in the alley was closed.'

And the bride could not have been any happier with how everything turned out.

'It was incredible, amazing. Like a flashmob,' she said.

'Some people were quite concerned but everyone was blown away and everyone cried even the photographer, it was crazy.'

'Loved the sandstone and all the hangings and the birdcages, public art work and the great space.'

And the special event certainly became a spectacle for the rest of the public, some who stood by and watching as the couple exchanged their vows. 

'A lot of people were like, what the heck..... they joined the back of the ceremony, tour groups, another wedding was taking photos as well, two policeman walked down and watched and just left,' she said. 

The unique wedding saw the bride wearing a vintage style lace gown, with iced blue tulle underneath by Atelier Altaari.

'I loved the colour, didn't want the usual cookie cutter dress.'

'It took a while to know what to wear but I met the dress maker three months before the wedding, so there was not much time.' 

All the flowers were from Annie's boutique Francis Floristry which incorporated a brightly coloured flower headpiece, with hot pink, and a cascading bouquet.

'I did all the floristry, reception, everything head to toe,' said Annie. 

The couple also got photos taken as they walked down to Circular Quay and had their reception at Ripples Chowder Bay which they traveled to by boat.

Celebrant Joshua Withers says the pop up wedding trend has really started to take off.

'When we first started doing it, I didn't think there'd be a wide appeal but week by week it is growing crazily,' he said.

'This coming Sunday I have seven couples, next May on the Gold Coast I am marrying 16 couples on the same day.' 

'Some people want to get married without the fuss, it's a growing trend that's becoming popular but not for everyone.' 

He describes pop up weddings as a unique way to celebrate a couple getting married.

'It won't appeal or apply to everyone, usually find a place, time, date, it's simple, casual and not the big white wedding, like Will and Kate's.'

'Usually little down to the core and basics, relatable to people getting married.'

And people it seems in Western Australia are relishing the idea and the need to have pop up weddings is becoming so popular it can be hard to keep up.

'WA gobbled it up, there's a lot of interest in Victoria, I'm too busy to get there, but there's interest everywhere,' said Joshua.

'People are getting married because they want to, it doesn't degrade the value of marriage, what happens on the day doesn't define them.'
