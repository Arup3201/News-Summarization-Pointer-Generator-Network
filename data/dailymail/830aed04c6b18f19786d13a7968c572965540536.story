Osama Bin Laden's family will be forced to take a flight from Pakistan to Saudi Arabia next Wednesday, following a court decision in the capital of Islamabad.

Two of the terrorist leader's former 
wives - Khairiah Sabar and Siham Sabar are Saudi nationals, while the 
third - Amal Ahmed Abdul Fateh is from Yemeni.

According to their lawyer Aamir Khalil, 
the relatives of the dead terrorist leader will be deported as soon as their 45 day house arrest was served.

All three, along with Bin Laden's 17 and 21 year old daughters, were placed under house arrest earlier this month having pleaded guilty to living illegally in Pakistan.

Just a few days ago the Al Arabiya television network released footage from inside the 'guest house' in Islamabad, where Bin Laden's family members have been holed up .

Toddlers and children are seen 
playing with teddy bears and cricket bats, while the three widows of Bin
Laden look on or read the Koran.

But the boarded-up windows and a 
heavy armed presence outside given an indication that while the place 
may serve as a home for the occupants, it is also a prison for Osama's 
relatives.

It is still not clear whether the Yemeni widow, Amal Ahmed Abdul Fateh, would stay in Saudi Arabia or would be transported on to her own country of origin.

According to CNN a source familiar with the widows' case said the Yemeni government has expressed a willingness to let Fateh return to her homeland.

sentenced for a month and a half under house arrest by a Pakistani court for 
illegal residency in the country

The three former wives of Bin Laden have been in Pakistani custody since U.S. Navy SEALs raided the terrorist's compound in Abbottabad and killed the al Qaeda leader in May 2011.

All the women confessed to impersonation, illegal entry into Pakistan and staying illegally, so a trial was not required. Mr Khalil said his clients would not appeal the 'lenient" sentence.

Fateh told Pakistani investigators that Bin Laden spent years on the run in Pakistan after the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks, moving from one safe house to another and fathering four children.

A deposition taken from Fateh gives the clearest picture yet of bin Laden's life while international forces hunted him. He and his family move from city to city with the help of Pakistanis who arranged 'everything' for them. she is reported as saying.

She told police she never applied for a visa during her stay in Pakistan.
