Health officials are investigating an outbreak of highly-contagious norovirus after some 60 people recently came down with the illness at a luxury hotel in the San Francisco Bay Area.

First signs of the outbreak appeared on October 26, when those who attended a NAACP convention at the hotel the night before started getting sick and a dozen were taken to the hospital by ambulance for treatment.

Norovirus spreads through contact with a infected person, as well as consuming contaminated food and water. Symptoms include stomach pain, nausea and diarrhea. 

Sickening: About 60 people have come down with norovirus after attending three special events at the luxury Hotel Sofitel in the San Francisco Bay Area recently 

While norovrius is the leading cause of outbreaks from contaminated food in the U.S., officials inspected the hotel's kitchen and food service areas and found no violations, leaving the virus's origin a mystery.

The more than 300 people who attended the NAACP's annual state conference dined on salmon  and salad. The virus continued to spread at two further special events at the hotel.

However, food operations resumed on Friday after the premises were disinfected and the staff retrained on cleanliness. 

Officials have interviewed patients and taken samples, but testing the specimens to find a common cause could take several weeks. 

Meanwhile staff are being told that if they come down with virus, to stay at home until they are symptom free for 72 hours. 

Nasty: Norovirus is an extremely contagious sickness that spreads through human contact and consuming contaminated food or water. Symptoms include stomach pain, nausea and diarrhea

The same hotel was the site of a similar outbreak in January 2008  when 62 people contracted norovirus while attending a Chamber of Commerce event which included a chicken and salmon dinner.

At the time, health officials found several code violations including the use of unsanitary clothes to wipe down kitchen equipment.

Outbreaks of norovirus are common in schools, health care centers, cruise ships and anywhere else where large groups of people are kept in close proximity.
