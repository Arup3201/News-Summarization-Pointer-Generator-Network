Nearly half of Mormons say church members face significant discrimination in the United States, and a third believe voters are not ready to elect Mitt Romney, or any other member of their church, president.

A survey of members of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints published by the Pew Research Center's Forum on Religion & Public Life comes as the former Massachusetts governor fights to keep his GOP front-runner status.

The campaign moves next to the January 21 primary in South Carolina, where evangelical voters are key. Former Utah Governor Jon Huntsman, who is Mormon, is also seeking the Republican nomination.

Front-runner: Mitt Romney's campaign has been emphasising values that Mormons and conservative Christians share

LDS church leaders have long 
complained that critics take obscure or outdated Mormon teachings and 
describe them as core doctrine.

The church cast aside the teaching of 
polygamy in 1890, and in 1978, abolished the barrier that kept those of 
African descent from full participation in the church. In the latest Pew
survey, only two per cent of Mormons said polygamy is morally 
acceptable.

The Pew study found that almost half of Mormons in the U.S. consider themselves more discriminated against than African Americans.

Despite the prejudice Mormons feel, a
majority expressed optimism about their future.

The question of religion: Republican presidential candidate Governor Jon Huntsman is another Mormon seeking the nomination

More than 60 per cent 
believe Americans are moving toward acceptance of Mormonism but 32 per 
cent don't believe the U.S. is ready to accept a Latter-day Saint as 
president. An overwhelming majority of Mormon voters hold favourable 
views of Romney, the poll found.

In the 2012 race, Romney has not 
directly addressed theological differences between his faith and 
historic Christianity, as he did in his first bid for the nomination, 
with a 2007 faith-and-values speech in Texas, Instead, his campaign has 
been emphasizing values that Mormons and conservative Christians share.

About 77 per cent of Mormons in the 
survey identify with or lean toward the Republican Party, and most hold 
much stronger conservative views than the general public. Three-quarters
support a smaller government that provides fewer services. The same 
percentage say having an abortion is morally wrong. Two-thirds believe 
homosexuality should be discouraged.

Rank-and-file Mormons reflect the 
strong emphasis throughout the LDS church on family. Asked their life 
priorities, a large majority of respondents listed being a good parent 
and having a successful marriage.

Latter-day Saints also have a high 
level of religious observance that surpasses even the most devout 
American Christians.

Three-quarters of Mormons said they attended 
religious services weekly or more, compared to 64 per cent of white 
evangelicals and 42 per cent of white Catholics. Two-thirds of Mormons 
say they pray several times a day, compared to half of evangelicals and 
about one-third of Catholics.

The poll of 1,019 Mormons was 
conducted October 25 through November 16 of last year and has a margin 
of error of plus or minus 4.5 percentage points:

Since 1994, a group of evangelical 
and Mormon scholars who have been meeting to discuss theology, focusing 
on their shared beliefs. All but two percent of Mormons in the Pew 
survey said they believe that Jesus was resurrected. Nearly all believe 
the Bible is the word of God and describe themselves Christian or 
'Christ-centred'.

However, Mormons just as strongly hold beliefs that traditional Christians consider heretical.

The study showed that Mormons and 
white evangelicals share an intense commitment to family life, prayer, 
the Bible and conservative politics, including support for the 
Republican Party and smaller government, but the two groups strongly 
hold divergent religious beliefs.

Conservative Christians, including 
Protestants and Roman Catholics, generally do not consider Mormons to be
Christian, but it is unclear what role those objections will play in 
South Carolina vote and beyond. Surveys have found that Republicans with
the strongest objections to Mormonism also are among the fiercest 
opponents to President Barack Obama, and would back a Mormon in the 
general election.

All but six per cent of Mormons 
believe that God the Father and Jesus Christ are separate, physical 
beings, a rejection of the doctrine of the Trinity, in which God, the 
Father, Jesus and the Holy Spirit coexist and share one substance.

Joseph Smith became Mormonism's 
founding prophet after he said he experienced visions during the late 
1820s. He said he was told not to join any church because they all held 
wrong beliefs. An angel, he said, then directed him to gold plates that 
had been buried in the ground in upstate New York, which Smith then 
translated as the Book of Mormon. Nearly all Mormons in the survey said 
they believe the Book of Mormon was written by ancient prophets and that
the president of the LDS church is a prophet of God.

The Pew Forum estimates that Mormons 
comprise less than two per cent of the U.S. population, are overwhelming
white and in the West. Nearly six in ten Mormons said that most or all 
of their close friends are also Mormon. The LDS church has been running a
multimillion-dollar advertising campaign featuring the personal stories
of Mormons hoping to educate the public.

The poll of 1,019 Mormons was 
conducted October 25 through November 16 of last year and has a margin 
of error of plus or minus 4.5 percentage points.
