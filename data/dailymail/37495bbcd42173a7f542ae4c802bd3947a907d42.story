Her coronation on June 2, 1953 was an unprecedented spectacle of pomp and pageantry.

Now, 60 years after the Queen was formally crowned at Westminster Abbey, Buckingham Palace is to reunite for the first time some of the dresses, uniforms, robes and jewellery worn for the historic event.

Paintings, works of art and unusual objects used for the event will also help to recreate the atmosphere of that extraordinary day, the essence of which has remained unchanged for almost 1,000 years.

Celebration: To mark the 60th anniversary of the Coronation of Her Majesty Queen 
Elizabeth II a special exhibition at Buckingham Palace will bring 
together an unprecedented array of the dress, uniform and robes worn for
the historic event

For the annual Summer Opening in 2013, the 
Palace's Ballroom will be transformed into the centre of the 
largest ever exhibition about the Coronation.

Here, the dress, robes and
uniforms worn by the principal royal party will be put on show together.

The display will include the Queen's Coronation Dress and Robe; the uniform, robe and Coronet of the Duke of Edinburgh; the dress and robe of the 
Queen Mother; the dress and robe of Princess Margaret; and the 
outfits worn on the day by two-year-old Princess Anne and four-year-old 
Prince Charles.

The Prince's personal invitation to Westminster Abbey 
will also be on display.

Iconic: The exhibition will include Cecil Beaton's famous Coronation portraits 
of The Queen, using his signature theatrical backdrops to recreate the 
inside of Westminster Abbey

Dazzling: The Diamond Diadem, which Her Majesty wore for the journey from Buckingham Palace to Westminster Abbey, will go on display

The Queen's white satin Coronation dress was 
created by the British couturier Norman Hartnell, who died in 1979.

The design is described as incorporating an 'iconographic scheme of embroidered national and 
Commonwealth floral emblems' in gold, silver and pastel-coloured silks, and is encrusted with pearls, crystals and sequins.

The exhibition at 
Buckingham Palace will also include the Queen's Robe of Estate, worn 
when the Queen departed from Westminster Abbey for the Palace.

The robe is made of 
English purple silk-velvet, more than 6.5 metres long from the 
shoulder to the tip of the train, and embroidered with 
wheat ears and olive branches representing peace and prosperity.

Huge crowds: Buckingham Palace was at the heart of the celebrations on Coronation Day, which heralded the dawn of a 'New Elizabethan Era'

As they were: The outfits worn on the day by two-year-old Princess Anne and four-year-old Prince Charles will be included in the exhibition

Picture perfect: Princess Anne wearing her Coronation Day dress, 23 July 1953

The embroidery was designed 
and executed by the Royal School of Needlework, a task that took 3,500 
hours to complete.

Exhibited with the dress 
and robe will be a number of jewels worn by the Queen on Coronation day.

These include the Diamond Diadem, worn by Her Majesty for the 
journey from Buckingham Palace to Westminster Abbey.

The Diadem was 
designed and made for George IV to wear at his coronation in 1821 by the
royal jewellers and goldsmiths, Rundell, Bridge and Rundell.

60 years on: 60 years after the Queen was crowned at Westminster Abbey, Buckingham Palace is to display some of the dresses, uniforms, robes and jewellery worn for the historic event

The Diadem
is one of the most recognisable of the Queen's jewels, as she is shown 
wearing it on postage stamps and some issues of banknotes.

Also on 
display will be the diamond Coronation necklace and earrings, made for 
Queen Victoria in 1858 by R & S Garrard & Co and worn by the Queen for the Coronation.

As they tour the State rooms, 
visitors will experience a sense of the atmosphere of Coronation day and
learn how individual rooms were used in 1953.

It was in 
the green drawing room, for example, that Cecil Beaton took his famous 
Coronation portraits of the Queen, using his signature theatrical 
backdrops to recreate the inside of Westminster Abbey.

Other official 
portraits were taken in the throne room.

Invite: The Prince's personal invitation to Westminster Abbey will also be on display

The Coronation State banquets 
were held on the evenings of 3 and 4 June 1953, and for the Summer 
Opening of the Palace, the table in the State dining room will be 
dressed to evoke the Banquets' magnificent settings of porcelain, 
silver-gilt and flowers.

Along the visitor route will be works of art 
and paintings linked to the occasion, including the Coronation Frieze 
(1960) by Feliks Topolski, who was commissioned to record the 
colour and excitement of the event, and Queen Elizabeth II in Coronation
Robes (1954), the State portrait by Sir Herbert James Gunn (1893-1964).

Buckingham Palace was at the heart of the celebrations 
on Coronation Day, which heralded the dawn of a 'New Elizabethan Era'.

Hundreds of thousands of well-wishers lined the Mall and filled the 
specially constructed stands around the Victoria Monument in front of 
the Palace.

From here they witnessed the carriage processions of Members
of the Royal Family, foreign Heads of State and Commonwealth Prime 
Ministers depart Buckingham Palace for Westminster Abbey.

The 
processions culminated with the Queen and the Duke of Edinburgh 
leaving the Palace in the gold State coach, drawn by eight Windsor greys
with coachmen in full State Livery.

The Palace was also the focal point
for the famous balcony appearance of the Royal Family to witness the 
flypast and later in the evening, when the Queen turned on the 
illuminations in the Mall.

Momentous occasion: The Queen acceded to the throne on 6 February 1952 and was crowned the following year, on 2 June 1953

Exhibition curator Caroline de Guitaut
said: 'The 60th anniversary of Her Majesty's coronation is an extremely
auspicious anniversary and it seems very fitting that we should mark it
by bringing together this unique display.

'This will be the first time since 1953 that the outfits of the principal royal party have been displayed together.

'As Buckingham Palace itself was very 
much a focal point for the celebrations on Coronation Day, it is an 
appropriate setting for visitors to experience something of the 
atmosphere of that historic day.

'The children's outfits help to remind us of The Queen as Sovereign and, at the same time, as the mother of two young children.'

The Queen's Coronation 1953 will run at Buckingham Palace as part of the summer opening from July 27 to September 29.
