In the tiny Texas town of Harrold, children and their parents do not give much thought to their safety at the community's only school, because they know that some of the teachers are carrying concealed weapons.

In the remote town, the nearest law enforcement office is 30 minutes away and the residents know each other and trust each other, so the school board made the momentous decision to allow teachers to arm themselves at their work around children.

Desperate to avoid the deadly consequences of their own school shooting incident, Harrold Independent School District has utlized armed teachers since 2007 and in the light of the Sandy Hook Elementary massacre became convinced it was the correct decision.

Armed and ready: At any one time, the teachers of Harrold Indepedent School District are carrying weapons and able to respond to a school shooter

'Virginia Tech was a wake up call. We evisioned that happening at our school, we envisioned having no protection,' said Harrold Schools Superintendant David Thweatt to CNN.

'Casualties mount up very quickly and the only thing as we know that has stopped any of the shooters in any of the schools has been the first responders showing up.'

Texas law bans guns in schools unless the school has given written authorization. Arizona and six other states have similar laws with exceptions for people who have licenses to carry concealed weapons.

Harrold's school board voted unanimously in 2007 to allow employees to carry weapons. After obtaining a state concealed-weapons permit, each employee who wants to carry a weapon must be approved by the board based on his or her personality and reaction to a crisis, Thweatt said.

Power: David Thweatt is the only man who knows which of the teachers are legally allowed to carry weapons at Harrold Independent School District

Unaware: While it is not sure if Craig carries a weapons - he told CNN he does not know which of his staff carry guns

The identities of the armed staff members are known only by the superintendent and not the students.

'Wilbarton county is roughly the size of Rhode Island. That is a lot of square mileage to be covered. Thirty minutes waiting for a first responder is an extremely long time when it comes to a school shooting,' said Thweatt.

'We really didn't have any choice but to come up with some plan where we could be our first responder much as we are in our homes.'

'We know who the good people are, who the bad people are and we are going to be able to assess very quickly what's going on.

'If a sheriff was to come in they don't know who the bad guys are'

Teachers also must undergo training in crisis intervention and hostage situations. And they must use bullets that minimize the risk of ricochet, similar to those carried by air marshals on planes.

'We focused on accuracy in our training and hostage situations,' said Thweatt.

'After Sandy Hook, I have been contacted by I can't tell you how many school leaders, how can I do this in my community?'

Decision: The Virginia Tech massacre was the tipping point for the school board in Texas to arm their teachers

'We would rather have guns protect us than rulers and pencils.' The students are whole-heartedly behind the idea

In interviews with the Associated Press just after Sandy Hook, CaRae Reinisch, who lives in the nearby community of Elliott, said she took her children out of a larger school and enrolled them in Harrold two years ago, partly because she felt they would be safer in a building with armed teachers.

'I think it's a great idea for trained teachers to carry weapons,' Reinish said. 'But I hate that it has come to this.'

The superintendent won't disclose how many of the school's 50 employees carry weapons, saying that revealing that number might jeopardize school security.

The school, about 150 miles northwest of Fort Worth near the Oklahoma border, has 103 students from kindergarten through 12th grade. Most of them rarely think about who is carrying a gun.

'This is the first time in a long time that I've thought about it,' said Matt Templeton, the principal's 17-year-old son. 'And that's because of what happened' in Connecticut.

Thweatt said other Texas schools allow teachers to carry weapons, but he would not reveal their locations, saying they are afraid of negative publicity.

The Texas Education Agency said it had not heard of any other schools with such a policy.

'When they decided to go with the policy there were things happening in the world,' said Principal Craig Templeton.

'If a gun is fired in a school, you want a person who will go to the gunfight not away from the gunfight.'

'I have heard the argument that teachers aren't police. But I would rather be able to call a parent and say your child is fine. That (the opposite) is something that I am not prepared to live with.
