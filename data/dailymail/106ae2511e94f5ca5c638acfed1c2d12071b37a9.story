A gruesome new beer brewed with goat brains has launched, paying homage to the hit zombie show The Walking Dead.

The Dock Street Brewing Company in Philadelphia says the animal organs - which are cooked over hot coals before being added to the liquid mix - add an 'intriguing, subtle smoke' flavor to the American pale stout.

The 7.2% alcoholic beverage will debut on Sunday March 30 to coincide with the season finale of The Walking Dead and has been named the 'Walker' after the series' wandering corpses.

Along with brains, the beer also contains cranberries, which apparently add a 'sinister, bloody hue' and 'slight tartness.'

Other more common ingredients in the ale include malted wheat, oats and flaked barley and fuggle hops.

Head brewer Justin Low said that he and many of the staff at Dock Street are loyal fans of The Walking Dead and they would spend Monday shifts recapping the previous night's episodes.

Fancy a sip? Along with brains the beer also contains cranberries, which apparently add a 'sinister, bloody hue' and 'slight tartness.'

The show, set in Georgia, premiered in 2010 on the AMC network and was renewed for a fifth season last fall.

As well as serving up its brain-infused beer, Dock Street will also show the season four finale on a big screen.

While the venue is excited about its latest creation, others aren't as enthused.

'Yuck. Nasty,' one commenter wrote after learning about the Walker beer. 'Mmmmmm,' another added suspiciously.

Dock Street isn't the first to brew with meat.

Last year, Denverâ€™s Wynkoop Brewing 
Company made national news by launching the Rocky Mountain Oyster Stout,
 a beer made with roasted bull testicles.

It was described as an 'assertive foreign-style stout, slightly viscous, with a deep brown color.

'It has equally deep flavors of chocolate syrup, Kahlua, and espresso, along with a palpable level of alcohol and a savory umami-like note.It finishes dry and roasted with a fast-fading hop bite.'

Wynkoop's head brewer Andy Brown added: 'We've been making ballsy beer for the past few years, and this is great proof of that.'
