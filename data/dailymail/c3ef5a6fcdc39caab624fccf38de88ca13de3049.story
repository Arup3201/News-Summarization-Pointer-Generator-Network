A woman was today ordered to stand trial in Australia, accused of breaking into a man’s home and raping him.

Rebecca Helen Elder, 39, pleaded not guilty to one count of aggravated serious criminal trespass at the man’s home, and one count of rape.

She appeared in Adelaide’s District Court this morning.

Accused: Rebecca Elder leaves court after denying accusations that she broke into a man's house and performed oral sex on him without his consent

Prosecution documents, filed with the court, allege both offences took place at a suburban location between September 20 and September 23 last year.

At trial, prosecutors will allege Elder, of Parkside, broke into a house while its male occupant - who cannot be named - was lawfully on the premises.  

They will also say she broke in with the intention of committing a further offence of rape.

Finally, prosecutors will accuse Elder of raping the man by performing an act of oral sex without his consent.

Judge Wayne Chivell remanded Elder on continuing bail until a directions hearing next month.
