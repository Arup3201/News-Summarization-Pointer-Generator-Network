Living in the shadow of a legend isn't easy; just ask Frank Sinatra Jr.

He's had 70 years to get used to being known as 'the son of', but there are still things that rankle - and supposedly long-lost brothers coming out of the woodwork is one of them.

Six months ago Mia Farrow, who was Frank Sinatra Sr's third wife for just 18 months in the late 60s, claimed in Vanity Fair magazine that her 26-year-old son Ronan - presumed to be her ex-lover Woody Allen's son - could 'possibly' have been fathered by Sinatra Sr who, she said, she 'never really split up from'.

The story had credence as Ronan, a blue-eyed journalist and former US government adviser, looks more like Frank than Woody.

'No, he's not my half-brother,' says Frank Jr, whose mother Nancy Barbato was the crooner's first wife.

'They weren't in touch; he was remarried and so was she. It was a shock when I heard what Mia said but I've since learned she was being interviewed by somebody she regarded as an idiot and when that person made the suggestion about Ronan she flippantly said, "Oh yes, of course." It was a joke. I don't think Ronan looks like Sinatra; he looks like her. Thank God for him that he doesn't look like Woody! I've never met him but I've seen his photo. He's a handsome young man but he's not Sinatra's son.'

However, there's no doubt about Frank Jr's parentage; he's the image of his father even if he has inherited his mother's brown eyes rather than Sinatra Sr's famous blue ones.

For most of his own singing career he tried to step away from his father and make his own music, but in recent years he's changed his tune.

He now tours around the world with his jazz band; his act is Sinatra Sings Sinatra and he'll be crooning all the old classics in the UK next week at the Cheltenham Jazz Festival alongside Jamie Cullum and Jools Holland.

'I feel like the audience looks to me to keep Sinatra alive,' says Frank Jr, who always refers to his father by his surname.

'I've sung my own songs in the past but no one was interested. Now people say my voice is just like his. If you're going to be compared to someone, why not the best?'

Frank Jr, whose big sister Nancy forged a singing career and little sister Tina is an actress-turned-TV producer, grew up in LA, where Ol' Blue Eyes was a loving but distant father.

For Frank Jr that became more pronounced when his parents divorced when he was six after Sinatra fell in love with Ava Gardner. 'We didn't see much of him; sometimes only once a year. He was making movies, recording albums, doing concerts. Of course it affected us but we had to learn to live with it.'

It soon became clear Frank Jr had a talent for music like his father. Aged 19 he went on tour with his band and that's when one of the most traumatic events of his life occurred.

Two drifters, Barry Keenan and Joe Amsler, spotted his name on a theatre poster and plotted his kidnapping. 'They decided the best way to make a great deal of money in a short space of time was to hold a rich man's kid for a ransom,' he recalls.

On the evening of 8 December, 1963, they knocked on the door of his hotel room. 'They pretended they were delivering a Christmas package. The next thing I knew this guy had a gun in my face.'

Frank Sr immediately offered $1m (£5m today), though the not-terribly-bright kidnappers stuck with what they'd planned and demanded just $240,000 (£1m today).

'I thought my life was over,' says Frank. 'I'd been blindfolded and held in a dirty house. It was like being in a movie. I knew they were in contact with Sinatra but I had no idea what was going to happen.'

His ordeal lasted four days; the money was handed over and Frank Jr released. The kidnappers were caught when one of them boasted about what he'd got away with.

Frank Jr was shaken but, in his eyes, worse was to come. 'The kidnappers made up a story there'd never been an abduction; that I'd planned it as a publicity stunt. This was much worse than the crime itself; I was made out to be a deceitful, despicable person. And the whole world thought it was true. It's hard to take when you've just turned 20.'

Even though his kidnappers were jailed, Frank Jr says his reputation was ruined. 'It definitely affected my career. People didn't trust me; they thought there's no smoke without fire.'

'Apparently being frightened of the 
shadow cast by your father is something people think about; I don't. My 
attitude is to be what I am, not try to be what I'm not'

Still, he carried on as a musician and in 1988 his father, who he now saw even more rarely, invited him to be musical director of his tour – a position he held until Frank Sr's final performance in 1995, three years before his death. 

'Being his musical director enabled me to spend time in his life, which meant I could give something back to him. That gave me a deep personal satisfaction. He'd fed me and clothed me and educated me; I wanted to know that I could contribute as well as receive.'

They were closer than ever; but it didn't mean they suddenly became best buddies.

'He always had so many people vying for his attention. I believed the more invisible I became, the better I was doing my job. But it was a happy time and when we came to the UK it was particularly exciting. I remember when we got to London I went into his dressing room at the Royal Albert Hall and damn near tripped over Sir Alec Guinness who was seated there with Richard Harris.

'When we got to Dublin Richard was there again and one morning he took me down to a pub on the dockside and he said, "Let's sit down, you can meet some of my friends and let's have a couple of bottles of ink (Guinness)." He got me zonked.'

Frank has his own son now, Michael, 27, who has avoided showbusiness and lives in Japan. He tries to see him regularly. Meanwhile, he has accepted his legacy.

'Apparently being frightened of the shadow cast by your father is something people think about; I don't. My attitude is to be what I am, not try to be what I'm not. There's never going to be anyone like my father again and no one knows that more than me.'
