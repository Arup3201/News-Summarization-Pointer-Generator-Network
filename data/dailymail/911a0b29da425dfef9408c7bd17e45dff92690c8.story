MPs have been urged to scrap their multi-million pound lunch subsidy amid fury at the cut-price Christmas lunches being offered in Parliament.

Before MPs broke off for Christmas they enjoyed lavish lunches – including chargrilled partridge, salmon marinated in vodka and guinea fowl for the same price as a high street pizza.

The meals are able to be offered for way below the going rate because taxpayers subsidise Parliament's restaurant and bars to the tune of £3million a year.

Parliamentary authorities insiste that bills have been reduced by hundreds of thousands and prices in bars and restaurants have been increased to reduce the burden on the public purse

The Strangers' Dining Room - used by members to wine and dine guests - is serving chargrilled spatchcocked partridge with roast pear, squash and game chips for £9.25.

Just a mile away from Parliament, ordinary members of the public have to pay £25 to dine on a roast leg of Partridge.

Another seasonal item at the restaurant is the roast Norfolk turkey breast wrapped in smoked pancetta with piccolo parsnips, baby sprouts, chestnut stuffing, cranberry gel and bread sauce foam for £12.

The fish menu includes confit halibut with lemon verbena, Anna potatoes, baby fennel, golden raisins and verjus for £15.

In the Portcullis Cafeteria main courses include braised guinea fowl breast with baked fig and celeriac rosti with ginger sauce for £4 and baked fillet of salmon in puff pastry with a rich tomato sauce, roasted cherry tomatoes and basil for £4.

At the Debate restaurant Christmas specials include grilled salmon fillet marinated in vodka and dill with vegetable tinsel for £4.

The Churchill Dining Room offers salt-baked celeriac with pea velouté, poached hen's egg, puffed potato, toasted panko and popcorn shoots for £10.

Parliamentary staff can also make use of the daily roast at the Members' Dining Room, where the fare includes traditional roast turkey with stuffing, pigs in blankets and cranberry sauce and mustard and honey glazed gammon with parsley sauce and sage and onion pudding

Peers are angry that ordinary office workers are now allowed to dine with them and have attacked the quality of dining, it emerged last month.

They also rejected a plan to merge dining with MPs, fearing the quality of champagne would suffer.

MPs have been urged to end the £7million a year subsidy for food and drink in the House of Commons

A spokesman for the TaxPayers' Alliance, said: 'Turkeys don't vote for Christmas but MPs should certainly vote to scrap the subsidised food and drink in Parliament.

'Everyone loves a festive lunch, but the Christmas menu in Parliament highlights the generous taxpayer subsidies that still exist there.

'With many people tightening their belts this Christmas it's time these out-of-date subsidies were axed.'

Lords have their own set of restaurants and have resisted plans to merge their catering with the Commons, fearing the quality of champagne might suffer.

The cost of food and drink at Parliament costs taxpayers about £3million a year.

A spokesman for the House of Commons said: 'The House of Commons Catering Service provides catering to over 10,000 people who work on or visit Parliament, including MPs, their staff, House staff, civil servants, contractors, journalists and members of public. 

'Much of the net cost to the House arises because of the irregular hours and unpredictability of Parliamentary business. Good progress has been made over the years to reduce the cost of catering.

'The budget for the current financial year, 2014-15, is for the net cost of catering services to be under £3million.'
