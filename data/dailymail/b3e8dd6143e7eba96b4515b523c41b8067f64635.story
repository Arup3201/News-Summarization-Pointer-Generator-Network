The popularity of Australian TV shows in the UK is changing the way we speak - and it could be having a knock-on effect on our careers.

More than 70 per cent of bosses claim that the rising trend among Britons - especially teenagers - of adding inflections to the ends of sentences is ‘particularly annoying.’

While almost 85 per cent said that when non-Australian people use this language trait it is a 'clear indicator of insecurity’ and could hinder their chances of a promotion or payrise.

Publisher Pearson polled 700 managers about the trend of young Britons using 'Australian Question Intonation'. Over 70% said the inflections are 'annoying', while 85 per cent said that when non-Australian people speak this way it is a 'clear indicator' of insecurity and could hinder their chances of a promotion

Australian 
Question Intonation (AQI) is a language trait seen most commonly in the Australian and American accents.

It is also known as a a 
high-rising terminal (HRT).

AQI is the act of raising a voice at the end of a sentence to make the statement sound like a question.

The origins of Australian Question 
Intonation are not clear, but previous studies suggest its roots may lie
 in New Zealand or from the west coast of the United States.

The comedian Stephen Fry famously 
described it as the 'language of the Sunny Delight generation', and said
 he 'barely knows anyone under 20 who doesn't use it.'

The language trait is known as a high-rising terminal (HRT), commonly referred to as ‘Australian Question Intonation’ (AQI).

It is the act of raising a voice at the end of a sentence that makes the statement sound like a question and is common in Australian and American accents.

According to UK publisher Pearson, the use of AQI has recently grown rapidly among teenagers and graduates in the UK.

The firm surveyed 700 men and women in managerial, executive and ownership roles.

The majority (71 per cent) agreed that AQI is a 'particularly annoying trait', with 85 per cent adding the use of the trait is a ‘clear indicator of a person's insecurity or emotional weakness.’

More than half said AQI would hinder the prospects of promotion and a better pay grade in their own organisation.

While 57 per cent believed AQI has the potential to damage a person's professional credibility by revealing an inability or reluctance to speak their mind.

Of the respondents responsible for 
interviewing job applicants for senior roles, only
 16 per cent said they would be willing to gloss over AQI and focus 
purely on an applicant's strengths and aptitude.

In some cases, 44 per cent of respondents admitted they would mark down an applicant by as much as a third based purely on the candidate's irritating speech.

However, this was only found to be the case when a British applicant used AQI, and didn’t apply when Australian or American people naturally spoke in that way.

The survey was conducted on behalf of Pearson to mark the release of Speak For Yourself - a guide to effective speech and communication due to be released later this month.

Author Harry Key, a voice techniques expert, said: ‘HRT is becoming increasingly common in the UK - especially among teenagers - but the results of this research suggest that using it in a business or workplace setting is definitely to be avoided.

'Based on the feedback we received, using HRT when making statements has the very real potential of jeopardising job prospects and, even, career paths in some organisations.'

Key added: 'Speaking in definite or indefinite tones doesn't just sound different, it feels different and will affect the way the speaker is perceived.

'The message is clear: if you know what you're talking about, and want to be respected for it, then you need to sound like you know it.'
