An upstate New York grinch stole a leg lamp from a North Tonawanda liquor store's beloved annual A Christmas Story-themed window display.

But if he's caught, the thief won't have a leg to stand on. Security footage clearly shows the man creep into Yankee Spirits on Thursday, swipe their beloved lamp and scuttle away.

The store's furious owner Gary Brennan is confident the man will be brought to justice, hopefully with the fragile movie prop intact.

Fra-gee-lay: A thief swiped a New York State liquor store's beloved leg lamp from its annual A Christmas Story themed window display

'This is our signature theme for our Christmas decorating,' reads a post on the store's Facebook. 'He is a worthless individual. He will be caught.'

The annual window display honoring the holiday classic includes memorabilia from the 1983 film, including several versions of the now-iconic leg lamp, WIVB reports.

By the looks of a photo on the store's Facebook, the thief absconded with the largest of the lot.

Full-sized mock-ups of the ceramic collectible are listed on Amazon for upwards of $300.

Walked right out of the store: 'This is our signature theme for our Christmas decorating,' reads a post on the store's Facebook. 'He is a worthless individual. He will be caught.'

In the movie, main character Ralphie's father wins a prize that turns out to be a garish lamp in the shape of a woman's leg in a fishnet stocking.

Ralphie's mother despises the novelty after seeing the way her husband covets it and pretends to 'accidentally' break it, leaving the Old Man heartbroken. 

In reality, the lamp has become the most memorable prop--along with its synonymous 'Fra-Gee-Lay' movie quote--from the holiday favorite film.

A Christmas Story airs round-the-clock on several U.S. television stations each year.

Even after three decades, the triple-dog dare doesn't get old.

The film A Christmas Story opened 31 years ago to mixed reviews but has shown its staying power as a holiday family favorite. Cleveland, where parts of the movie were filmed and hard-luck Ralphie dreamed big, is celebrating the anniversary with iconic leg lamps, holiday store windows like the ones that drew Ralphie's wide-eyed stares, and stage and musical versions of A Christmas Story. 

'It becomes part of your fabric for your whole life,' said Kevin Moore, managing director of the Cleveland Play House, where the stage version of the story has become a holiday staple.

An American family: Blue collar quirkiness and all-American family values make A Christmas Story a perennial favorite

In the film, starring Darren McGavin as the father, 9-year-old Ralphie was transfixed by the brightly decorated storefront windows. And he dreamed of getting an air rifle as a Christmas gift, despite warnings that he might shoot his eye out.

The plot follows his determined gift-begging, his encounters with bullies and his family's daily hopes and dreams - including a lamp in the form of a shapely leg.

The Cleveland house where Ralphie's film family lived will highlight the anniversary Friday and Saturday with appearances by original cast members and a BB gun range in the backyard.

The movie wasn't widely acclaimed when it debuted, with favorable reviews barely outnumbering bad mentions like the one that grumped, 'Bah, humbug' in the headline. But its quirky humor and love-in-family message struck a chord with audiences.

The appeal in Ralphie's blue-collar hometown is simple, Moore said. 'It's just a really quirky and yet incredibly sweet story and that resonates with Cleveland,' he said. 

The movie 'snow' was actually mostly firefighting foam, pressed into service amid a cold but rare snowless stretch during filming in winter-hardy Cleveland.

Like many of the best holiday classics, the risky business turns cheerful at the end. Now families get together at holiday gatherings to watch the movie or crowd theater performances.

'It fills up the seats because it's a family experience,' Moore said.
