Barbara Walters while speaking at a breast cancer research awards event revealed for the first time her own experience with the all-too-common disease.

The ABC News legend was being honored at the Breast Cancer Research Symposium and Awards in New York when she dropped the bomb.

'Some years back, I discovered a small lump in my breast,' the 85-year-old said. 'I had a lumpectomy. There were other choices possible. This was mine.'

Walters was honored alongside Good Morning America host Amy Robach, who got her own breast cancer diagnosis after an on-air mammogram.

'I knew the advances that had been made in treating breast cancer, including lumpectomies when possible. I can remember when such treatments were not available,' she said. 'Research made my treatment possible.'

Walters also spoke of her co-awardee's more visible struggle with the disease.

'When [Amy] discovered she had breast cancer, she handled it in the most magnificent and wise, sensitive way,' Walters said, as reported by Page Six. 'I think what Amy has done, and the path she has chosen, has saved the lives of many women.'

Walter's own sister passed away from ovarian cancer and Walters reportedly had her own ovaries removed for preventative reasons. 

Walters stepped down from daily television on her ABC show "The View" in May but still does special projects for the network.
