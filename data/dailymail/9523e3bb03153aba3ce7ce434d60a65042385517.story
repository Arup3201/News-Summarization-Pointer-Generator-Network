Chic in a stylish fedora hat and printed mini-dress from Zara, Princess Beatrice was the picture of sophistication as she relaxed on a yacht during an Easter break in the Caribbean.

The stylish royal arrived on Thursday night and joined her boyfriend Dave Clarke, 31, who had been enjoying a boy's holiday with friends.

But his antics, which included mooning at fellow beach goers, left the princess looking less than impressed and the pair were seen deep in conversation - with Mr Clark perhaps on the receiving end of a telling off.

All aboard! Princess Beatrice is helped onto a luxury yacht during her visit to St Bart's in the French West Indies

Despite the high jinks, normal service soon resumed with the couple looking relaxed and happy as they enjoyed a trip on a luxury yacht.

Virgin Galactic executive Clark was later seen splashing around and enjoying the turquoise waters while reclining on a foam mattress.

Princess Beatrice, by contrast, chose to stay safe on dry land and was spotted exploring the shops with a friend.

The twosome are holidaying on the Caribbean island of St Barts, an exclusive island loved by A-list fans including Beyonce, Naomi Watts and Jon Bon Jovi.

The island has also proved a favourite of Princess Beatrice and her boyfriend, who last took a holiday there just four months ago.

Part of the Leeward Islands, the island is one of four that make up the French West Indies, the others being St Martin, Guadeloupe and Martinique.

Popular celebrity haunts include Maya's, a beachside restaurant just outside the capital Gustavia and the Eden Rock hotel's Sand Bar.

‘The Caribbean island of St Barts is synonymous with the rich and famous, from Beyonce and Jay-Z to Roman Abramovich,' comments MailOnline acting travel editor, Sarah Gordon.

‘While celebrities are certainly seen here, it is the ultra-wealthy media moguls and steel magnates that really love to splash out on holidays in this exclusive spot.

‘All of that makes it perfect for the royals, who can enjoy the island’s relative privacy and lack of “riff raff” – the island can be difficult and pricy to reach, ensuring most regular holidaymakers head elsewhere.'

High jinks: Dave Clark arrived on St Bart's early to spend some time having fun with friends

Messing around: The Virgin Galactic executive, 31, was seen splashing around and having a high old time

Oops! He did appear to be having some trouble with his foam mattress but still enjoyed himself

Paradise: The island of St Bart's is a celebrity favourite and is part of the French West Indies
