Apology: Cumbria PCC Richard Rhodes had billed the taxpayer £700 for the rides

A whistleblower arrested after revealing the excessive expenses of a Police Crime Commissioner has been told she will not face criminal charges because what she did was ‘in the public interest’.

But the police worker, aged 50, who has been suspended from work for five months, still faces disciplinary procedures to determine whether she can keep her job.

She was arrested after a local newspaper published details of two chauffeur-driven trips taken by Cumbria PCC Richard Rhodes.

He had billed the taxpayer £700 for the rides – and it was only after the disclosure that he apologised and said he would pay the money back.

Despite this, the woman was arrested on suspicion of misconduct in public office and a breach of the data protection act.

Those found guilty of these offences commonly draw prison sentences of a year or more.

Yesterday, prosecutors announced they were dropping the case because any alleged leak would have been ‘in the public interest’.

Crown Prosecution lawyer Simon Orme said: ‘To rely on this defence, an individual is required to establish on the balance of probabilities that the disclosure was in the public interest.

Investigation: The newspaper that was alerted, the Cumberland and Westmorland Herald (whose offices are pictured), called Mr Rhodes's office to check the details of his expenses

‘In my view, given the nature and circumstances of the disclosure, the suspect would be in a position to do so and, therefore, there is insufficient evidence to provide a realistic prospect of conviction.’ 

Charges against a further person accused of helping to facilitate the leak have already been dropped.

Another person who was accused of perverting the course of justice will also escape prosecution.

The scandal broke in April after Mr Rhodes spent £700 going to two dinners in the county in a hired Mercedes with a driver. The trips cost the taxpayer £385 and £313.

Mr Rhodes has always maintained he did not realise how much the trips had cost and decided to pay the money back once he was told.

He has said that in the future he would use his £23,000 Hyundai crossover – another taxpayer-funded perk.

MPs from all parties have condemned the police inquiry that followed after the newspaper that was alerted, the Cumberland and Westmorland Herald, called Mr Rhodes’s office to check the details of his expenses.

Happy: MP Tim Farron said the news vindicates 'that these people are whistleblowers and not criminals'

Yesterday Liberal Democrat MP Tim Farron said: ‘This is good news and vindicates what I and others have been saying for months – that these people are whistleblowers and not criminals.

'The police have spent a huge amount of money and time on this investigation while disrupting the lives and careers of a number of people with arrests.’

He added that ‘questions should be asked about why the force spent so much time and resources’ on the case.

Cumbria county councillor Helen Fearon, who is on the police and crime panel which is supposed to scrutinise the actions of the commissioner, said she would be raising the ‘disproportionate’ actions of the police at the next meeting.

She added: ‘We have had conflicting statements about the involvement of the Commissioner and his staff in these investigations.’

A spokesman for Cumbria Police said its ‘staff and police officers have a duty to protect and manage the information they have privileged access to. Any allegations relating to a breach of this position need to be investigated’.
