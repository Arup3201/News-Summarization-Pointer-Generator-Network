A creative best man stunned a newlywed couple by turning his speech into a ten-minute medley of personalised pop songs - which still poked fun at the groom. 

Jon Imondi, 33, performed the musical toast to Nathan, 33, and Laura Webb, 34, during their reception at Deer Park Hall in Worcester. 

The  amateur singer serenaded the couple and their guests with his own funny version of well-known hits after deciding he was not keen on a traditional groomsman's speech.

Jon Imondi, 33, stunned newlyweds Nathan, 33, and Laura Webb, 34, by singing his best man's speech

The amateur singer said he didn't fancy standing up and telling jokes to a room full of people, so did what came naturally to him

But the singer still managed to drop in the obligatory best man insults, by reworking some of the songs' lyrics.

His performance included humorous jibes at the groom's ginger hair and even a suggestion that the bride was marrying her husband out of pity. 

The medley began with Mr Imoldi's own version of Sex is on Fire by Kings of Leon, in which he replaced the lyrics with his 'hair is on fire' - a dig at Nathan's  hair.

He then broke into 'I'm Gonna Be (500 Miles)' by The Proclaimers, before subgubg 'Don't Look Back in Anger' by Oasis and 'A Little Respect by' Erasure.

The IT support engineer finished the medley with a version of Elton John's Lion King hit 'Can You Feel The Love Tonight'. 

The video shows the wedding guests embracing the performance with many laughing and clapping along as friend Gary Prosser, 31, plays the guitar.

The best man, from Worcester, said: 'I'd had about an year to plan this and I was going to do Bohemian Rhapsody with different words.

'But then it got to a about a week before the wedding and I still hadn't prepared anything. I decided I wanted to play songs with a guitar as well so I asked Gary to accompany me.

'I made a list and showed him the songs on Monday night and then wrote the lyrics between Monday and Thursday.

He serenaded the couple's friends and family with his own rendition of a medley of songs at the reception at Deer Park Hall in Worcester

It began with his own version of Sex is on Fire by Kings of Leon and was followed by 'I'm Gonna Be (500 Miles)' by The Proclaimers, 'Don't Look Back in Anger' by Oasis and 'A Little Respect by' Erasure

'We had one chance to run through all the songs together and Nathan didn't know a thing.

'I had spent the early part of the wedding telling everyone I had nothing planned so it would come as an even bigger surprise when we finally did it.

'The other best man gave his speech and then I stepped up. A normal speech just wouldn't have been me at all, but a year ago I wouldn't have had the confidence to sing like that either.

He said: 'The reaction from everyone at the wedding was brilliant. It couldn't have gone better'

'But I joined a singing group last year where we did a production of Jesus Christ Superstar, and that kind of spurred me on to do more singing.

'The reaction from everyone at the wedding was brilliant. It couldn't have gone better.

'I've known Nathan for about seven years after he started coming along to play for our Sunday League team.

'We were both single at the time so we would just go out drinking together.'

Yesterday Mr Webb, from Pershore, Worcestershire, said: 'I was interested to see what he would do, but I didn't think for a second it would be anything like that.

'I thought it would be the usual best man-type stuff.

'He did tell a couple of jokes and then pretended we were all going to have to go outside, but then he said he was kidding and let us all sit down again.

'Next thing I knew a guitar came out and he did that with Gary.

'I even stayed at Jon's the night before the wedding with Gary as well, and they didn't let on at all.

'Laura loved it, she gets on well with both my best men so they were easy choices when it came to who to pick.

'The wedding was full of friends more than extended family and a lot of younger people were there so the songs went down brilliantly.

'I think he told the other best man the week before, who came round to my house really nervous, which makes perfect sense now, knowing he had got to do a speech with what was following.'
