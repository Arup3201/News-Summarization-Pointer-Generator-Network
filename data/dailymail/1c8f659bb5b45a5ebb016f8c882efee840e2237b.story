Sergeant 1st Class Gregory McQueen admitted recruiting three female officers into a prostitution ring

An army officer whose role was to advocate for victims of sexual abuse has been dishonorably discharged and sentenced to two years in prison for organizing a prostitution ring at an army base.

Sergeant 1st Class Gregory McQueen recruited the female soldiers to serve as prostitutes for high ranking officers at Fort Hood in Texas - one of the biggest bases in the country.

As his court-martial was about to open earlier this week, he pleaded guilty to 15 counts that included charges of pandering and conspiracy to solicit prostitution.

One female officer was told she could make lots of money at swinger and stripper parties, while another claimed McQueen arranged for her to have sex with an officer for $100.

Two soldiers testified last year that McQueen recruited them and other cash-strapped female soldiers to join the prostitution ring.

A military judge sentenced him to two years in prison and a dishonorable discharge while leading a sexual abuse prevention program at the sprawling Central Texas post.

However, he pleaded not guilty to sexual assault.

One of the female soldiers had previously testified that McQueen arranged for her to have sex for $100 with an officer, Master Sergeant Brad Grimes. 

But prosecutors told Judge Lieutenant Colonel Rebecca Connally that while there were plans for a tryst, the two never had sex.

The woman had told investigators she was 20 when she confided in McQueen about money problems after her husband left her and her three-year-old son and drained the couple's bank account.

She also testified that McQueen had sex with her and took photos of her naked to show potential clients.

Grimes has already been demoted and reprimanded after he was found guilty by a jury conspiring to patronize a prostitute and solicitation to commit adultery.

Initial charges were filed against McQueen in March 2014.

Fort Hood officials haven't indicated whether anyone involved in the conspiracy actually had sex, according to the San Antonio Express-News.

In addition to trying to recruit the young female soldiers, McQueen admitted trying to get two higher ranking officers to agree to have sex with junior female officers.
