Asbo: Aaron Knowles, 14, has been banned associating with his own brothers after leading them into a gang of youths who terrorised their neighbourhood

A baby-faced teenager who terrorised his neighbourhood has been banned from hanging around with the rest of his gang - including two of his own brothers.

Aaron Knowles, 14, was handed an Anti-Social Behaviour Order (Asbo) after leading a gang of youths aged nine to 19 on a campaign of vandalism and abuse in Preston, Lancashire.

He and his gang, whom residents compared to the pint-sized mobsters of Bugsy Malone, would regularly throw stones at people, hurl abuse at passers-by and were even involved in assaults.

Residents in the Broadgate area of Preston were left 'frightened and intimidated' by the boys, whom police said had their lives 'made a misery' by the gang.

The order bans Knowles him from visiting his usual haunts, and also from being in the company of nine other gang members - including his younger siblings Marcus Knowles, 13, and Jamie Knowles, nine.

The brothers will not be allowed out together unless their parents or another family member is looking after them.

Police said fed-up residents were 'practically queuing up' to make complaints against Knowles and his gang when a police officer was sent to patrol the area.

The officer compiled a dossier of evidence against Knowles and his accomplices and persuaded magistrates in Preston to grant a two-year Anti-Social Behaviour Order (Asbo) against him.

The courts also ordered that Knowles should be publicly named and shamed.

Under the conditions of the order, Knowles is banned from the Broadgate area, and faces a five-year prison sentence if he is caught using foul language or being abusive towards people in the nearby Riversway area of the city.

Aaron Knowles was banned from associating with nine boys, including two of his brothers.

Two members of the violent and abusive gang are still at primary school:

Keaton McMillan, nineJamie Knowles, nineAndrew Aspden, 11Marcus Knowles, 13Connor Silcock, 14Adam Clayton, 15Declan Caroll, 15Marvin Wiltshire, 16Conor Walmsley, 19

Police will also distribute leaflets to residents and shops featuring Knowles's police mugshot and warning people of the conditions of his ban.

One local said: 'Those boys are nothing but a menace and Aaron is the worst of the lot. He may look like butter won’t melt but he’s got a mouth on him that will shock anyone.

'They go round thinking like they're something out of Bugsy Malone but they’re not loveable at all.

'They must be to blame for half the vandalism and graffiti in the area and those lads would be jostling the residents whenever they went to the shops or out an errands.

'Some people dreaded going out for fear of bumping into them. Most of us blame the parents but I bet they must be mortified too.'

The Knowles brothers live their mother Michelle Riding and father Mark Knowles. At their Victorian terraced home in Preston a man who answered the door said: 'We don’t want to talk about this.'

But a relative said: 'We believe this is all down to parenting more than anything else. They could be nice boys but we never see them and it’s such a shame.'

Another said: 'We heard Aaron is regularly seen out about smoking and causing trouble. There’s no point beating around the bush - they haven’t had much parenting.

'The fact is if they are allowed to do what they want then they are going to go out and do it if the parents aren’t going to stop them.'

Ban: Knowles is banned by his Asbo from going to the Broadgate area of Preston in Lancashire

In a statement Lancashire Police said: 'Knowles was part of a group that had been blighting the lives of residents in the Broadgate area and was involved in several incidents which police responded to, including assaults, stone throwing, criminal damage, loitering around local shops and businesses, and being abusive towards people living in the vicinity.'

Broadgate Community Beat Manager PC Carl Ingram added: 'Aaron Knowles has been making life a misery for a large proportion of the Broadgate neighbourhood.

'Residents were practically queuing up to make complaints as I patrolled the area.

'People were saying that the noise and the abuse was making them ill to the point where they were wanting to move away from the area.

'We are committed to making sure Preston is not blighted by this type of behaviour and we will continue to use tactics such as Asbos to improve the quality of life for local residents.'
