Scottish MP Jo Swinson believes the 'body shaming' language damages people's confidence

A minister has called for an end to so-called 'fat talk', including terms such as muffin tops, bingo wings and cankles.

Scottish MP Jo Swinson believes the 'body shaming' language damages people's confidence and wants women and children to ban the terms from everyday conversation.

The equalities minister said: 'It's depressingly commonplace to hear 
women - and even young girls and children - insulting their own bodies.

'Muffin tops, thunder thighs, cankles - fat talk and body shaming too 
easily become a habit and an expectation.'

Her comments - reported in the Sunday Times - come amid high profile campaigns by celebrities.

Hunger Games star Jennifer Lawrence last week called for the word fat to be 'illegal to use' on television, and American model Tyra Banks has launched a campaign with the Special K cereal brand to discourage women from using fat talk.

The 40-year-old supermodel and America's Top Model judge, who said she uses the term 'fiercely real' instead of 'plus size.

She told Huffington Post Style: 'I don't like the label "plus-size".

'I
 don't want to use the term "plus-size," because, to me, what the hell 
is that? It just doesn't have a positive connotation to it. I tend to 
not use it.'

Research complied by the government has revealed that, regardless of whether they start off fat or thin, women with poor body confidence 
are more likely to put on weight.

It also found that girls who lack body confidence are less likely to do well at school and work.

Future campaigns will now focus on encouraging women to become healthy, rather than solely on losing weight.Â 

A government source said: 'Fatshaming, trying to motivate weight loss through self-disgust, is unlikely to produce sustained benefit.'

Special K revealed that 93per cent of women 
'fat talk', which the company says is 'weighing women down'

As
 women strive to get back on track this
 New Year, Special K chose to partner with Ms Banks for a campaign 
titled 'shhhhut down fat talk'  to help shift the weight management 
conversation to a
 more positive one

Swinson has also supported the use of plus-size mannequins on the high street.

At the time she said: 'The images we see in the world of fashion are all pretty much the same - it's as if there's only one way of being beautiful. Yet nine in ten people say they would like to see a broader range of body shapes shown in advertising and the media

'Many customers want to see more realistic images in magazines, TV and on the high street, and having mannequins that reflect and celebrate our diverse society is one way of helping to achieve this.'
