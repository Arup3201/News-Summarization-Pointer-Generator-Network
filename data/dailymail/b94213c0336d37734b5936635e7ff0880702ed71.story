Blue and white florals were a hit with Camilla and the Queen this week, and now Pippa Middleton joins the club.

Dressed in ideal attire for the occasion, the Duchess of Cambridge's younger sister stepped out in a ladylike white summer outfit with blue flower print for the Coronation Festival yesterday.

Pippa, 29, wore a flowing skirt and lace top finished off with an Audrey clutch bag from Lamb 1887 and Aruna Seth platform shoes in stone. Her hair was styled in beachy, yet elegant, waves.

She stepped out for the occasion with 
her brother James. The two sat in the royal box with the Queen and their
 parents Michael and Carole Middleton at Buckingham Palace.

Looking
 happy and relaxed, the Middletons mingled confidently with members of 
the royal family watching a gala performance of music and dance from 
throughout the Queen's reign as part of the Coronation Festival.

Sitting two rows behind the Queen, Carole looked supremely elegant in a cream dress and jacket with bracelet sleeves and greeted the first royals to arrive, which included Lady Helen Taylor with warmth and familiarity.

Relaxed: Grandfather-to-be Michael Middleton did not seem worried about his eldest daughter's impending labour as he chatted with Pippa

Siblings: Pippa and brother James joined the Queen in the Royal Box for the evening

Pippa and James waved and exchanged greetings with Zara Phillips, who was making her first public appearance since announcing she was pregnant earlier this week and hid any baby bump under a loose fitting patterned shift dress.

Sources have told the Mail that Kate is feeling so comfortable and relaxed even in these latter stages of her pregnancy that she even considered attending the performance with her family tonight, but eventually decided against it.

The other grandparents to be, Prince 
Charles and the Duchess of Cornwall, were also present and accompanied 
the Queen who would normally have Prince Philip by her side. He is still
 recovering from abdominal surgery.

The Duke of York, Princess Eugenie and the Earl and Countess of Wessex were also in the front row.

Sophie was showing off her newly svelte figure in a form fitting cream dress, which was rather spoilt by a bizarre feather ruff around her neck.

Each member of the royal box had a blue blanket on their seat in case of a drop in temperature.

Among the performers were Katherine Jenkins, Katie Melua and Dame Kiri Te Kanawa.
