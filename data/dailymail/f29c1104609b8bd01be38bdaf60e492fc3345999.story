Britons have been urged to help prevent thousands of homes being flooded during the big thaw - by building an army of snowmen.

With much of the country blanketed in white during the recent cold snap, families have been out in force to make sculptures in the snow, and the Government wants to see even more built, for reasons of function as well as fun.

With temperatures expected to swing from -13C to 13C at the weekend, the Environment Agency suggested that snow and ice compacted into snowmen might melt more slowly than that left lying on the ground.

Fun AND functional: Building a snowman could help to prevent homes being flooded during the expected thaw at the weekend, the Environment Agency says

Spokesman Roy Stokes said the slowing down the melt will mean there is less surface water come the time of a thaw.

'Ideally if everybody built themselves a snowman that will slow the thaw down a bit,' he said.

'If you notice when people clear their drive the snow thaws away but the compacted piles stay which will give a balanced thaw, which would be helpful.'

'We would rather it be a gradual thaw than a really quick one.

'If it does go too quick we are likely to see a few flood alerts. If you are at risk of flooding make sure you have got all of your planning in place,' Mr Stokes added.

Fighting the flood: Weather experts have predicted a sudden thaw when temperatures swing from -13C to 13C at the weekend

Dr Simon Keeling, forecaster at weatherweb.net, warned that localised flooding was likely to follow the thaw.

'There is going to be a big swing in temperatures, from as low as -13C on Friday night to 13C on Tuesday,' he said.

'It will be really noticeable, and as the majority of England, Scotland and Wales is under a layer of snow there will be a lot of standing water around.

'We will see a lot of standing water around so there is likely to be localised flooding and driving conditions will not be good.

'We are going to see a rise in temperatures next week followed by a cooling period again, but nothing like the freeze we have seen lately,' he added.

A spokesman for the Environment Agency later said Mr Stokes was joking and added: 'While building snowmen is great fun, sadly it is unlikely to make a significant difference to the overall rate at which the snow melts.

'The most important thing anyone can do to protect themselves from flooding is to check out if they are in a flood risk area, and sign up to free flood warnings on the Environment Agency website.'
