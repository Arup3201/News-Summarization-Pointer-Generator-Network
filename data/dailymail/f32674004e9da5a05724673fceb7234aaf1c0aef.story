Roma striker Gervinho had a Christmas to forget when he discovered his Italian home in Axa, near Rome, had been burgled as he spent time with family in the Ivory Coast.

According to La Gazetta Dello Sport, the former Arsenal man was robbed after he posted photos on social media informing fans he was going to be out of the country. 

It is reported that the unknown culprits took tens of thousands of pounds worth of goods including jewellery and watches.

The tweet posted by the striker on Christmas Eve told his 243,000 followers he would be out of the country

Gazetta say it was Gervinho's brother who discovered the burglary and reported it to the police.

It is possible that the thieves entered through a door window although it remains unclear if the alarm was turned off before they entered. 

Gervinho is expected to return to Rome on Tuesday, when the extent of the robbery will be confirmed.

The Ivorian is not the only Roma player to have been targeted by thieves this Christmas, with Radja Nainggolan returning to Italy from London on Christmas Day to find that his car had been broken into whilst it was parked at Fiumicino Airport.

Tweeting angrily after he found the windows of his vehicle smashed and some parcels missing, the Belgian star wrote: 'Thanks Fiumicino airport for the nice Christmas gift!'
