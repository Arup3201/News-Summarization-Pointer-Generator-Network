Heartless thieves have left a couple devastated after ransacking their home and stealing laptops, jewellery - and their pet SAUSAGE DOG.

Plumber Marc Rose, 26, came back to to his home in Carleton, near Blackpool, Lancashire on Monday lunchtime to find two computers, an iPad, an iPhone 5 and a gold watch had been stolen, while the stairs had been daubed with spray paint.

But the misery for he and his girlfriend, Jade Earley, was made all the worse when they realised the burglars had also taken their four-month-old pedigree dachshund, Richie.

Heartbroken Mr Rose says losing Richie was like having a child snatched from him

The pet dog, worth around £1,000, was bought by Mr Rose as a Christmas present for Miss Earley.

The emotional couple have now made an heart-felt plea to the thieves to return Richie - as they continue to walk the streets looking for him.

Mr Rose blasted the criminals as 'sick', adding: 'It’s like taking a child because he’s been a massive part of the family for the last four months and now he’s gone.

'I don’t mind the other things being taken, but not my dog. I’m seething with anger, but that’s not getting me anywhere.

'We’d been talking about getting a dog for a long time and we thought long and hard about getting one.

'He was beautiful when I first saw him and we are devastated. I just hope we get some justice and they go to prison because that’s what they deserve.'

The couple say Richie, who was a Christmas present for Miss Earley, would have been petrified of any intruders

Richie is kept in the conservatory during the day and would have been unable to get out without someone opening the door.

The front door was also closed when Mr Rose came home, meaning Richie couldn’t have escaped of his own accord.

Miss Earley, 24, a beauty manager at Tesco, says the couple have notified the RSPCA and local dog kennels, are now depserately looking for Richie in places where they usually walk him.

She added: 'It’s the worst possible thing imaginable.

'You would think someone coming into your house is bad enough, but nothing compares to them taking your dog. It’s awful.

'He’s small and is nervous around people anyway, so he would’ve been scared and tried to hide behind the couch to get away.

'We’ve been everywhere we can think of and it's just a complete worry.'

Lancashire Police have appealed for anyone in the area with information to call 101.
