Egypt's pope urged his congregation to be joyful and 'not be afraid' in his Mass for Coptic Christmas as he attempted to reassure a community anxious about the rise of Islamists to power.

Pope Tawadros II's words came before the Egyptian military revealed it foiled an attempted car bombing which was likely targeting an abandoned church or a nearby military camp under construction along the Egypt-Gaza border.

Tawadros also prayed for peace and stability for Egypt when he led his first Christmas Midnight Mass late on Sunday night in Cairo.

He asked God to guide Islamist President Mohammed Morsi and his government to lead 'wisely'.

On Monday Egyptian military spokesman Colonel Ahmed Mohammed Ali said security forces learned militants were preparing a car bomb late Sunday in a deserted part of the city of Rafah, which borders Gaza.

Three military vehicles raided the site, forcing the suspected militants to flee, some by foot and others in an unmarked pick-up truck.

They left behind a vehicle packed with explosives, bullet casings, and a rocket-propelled grenade, the spokesman said.

Ali said it was not immediately clear what the militants intended to attack, but that officials suspected the target was likely an abandoned church or a military camp used by police and border guards.

Egypt's Copts were celebrating Christmas today, and the potential violence against a church on the holiday is unsettling for a community already anxious about the rise of Islamists to power in Egypt following the uprising that toppled longtime leader Hosni Mubarak.

Tawadros was elected in November to replace longtime Pope Shenouda III, who died in March after 40 years as leader of the ancient church.

His prayers reflected the concerns of the Coptic Christians, who represent about ten per cent of Egypt's 85 million people.

Many are feeling unsettled under the country's first Islamist president and a newly passed constitution that could open the way for stricter Islamic law in Egypt.

Even before the rise of Islamists to power, the Christian minority had long complained of discrimination by the state and the Muslim majority.

But since Egypt's uprising against authoritarian rule, the community has grown more concerned about its future as Islamist political forces, long repressed under the previous autocratic regime, grew more assertive.

'Don't be afraid,' Tawadros said in his midnight sermon, selecting messages from the Bible to reassure his congregation.

'Even if humans feel lots of fear, remember God will take care of you. This is a collective message because fear is contagious... This is a message of reassurance.'

Coptic Christians celebrate Christmas today according to a different calendar than Roman Catholics and Protestants use.

Tawadros said: 'We pray for this beloved country, Egypt, for God to protect her safety, security, stability; to protect her unity and more so, her image.

'We don't pray for the land. We pray for the humans, all humans ... starting with the president, Mohammed Morsi, and all officials, and for God to give everyone wisdom and responsibility to manage the affairs of this country and its people in true Egyptian spirit.'
