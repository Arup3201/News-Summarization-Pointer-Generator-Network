They are certainly advanced despite their tender years, thanks to their precocious talent and famous parents.

But even their grown-up fans will be left scratching their heads after reading a new interview the children of Will and Jada Pinkett-Smith.

Willow, 14, and Jaden, 16, sat down with T Magazine to discuss Prana energy (meditation), school being overrated and how Willow possesses the ability to control time.

The siblings also rant about how 'life is meditation' and how babies 'remember' when they are born.

Radical thinkers: Jaden Smith, 16, and Willow Smith, 14, talk quantum physics, their ability to control time and why school is useless in the new issue of The New York Times Style Magazine T

First off, the pair reveal in the interview that Willow is currently reading 'quantum physics' while Jaden reveals he is glossing over an 'ancient text' called The Ancient Secret of the Flower Life [that] can’t be pre-dated'.

The interviewer then asks the pair what themes 'recur' in their music, to which Jaden replies 'the melancholiness of the ocean; the melancholiness of everything else' while Willow describes the feeling of being in a 'holographic reality that a higher consciousness made'. 

It is not surprising, that they both confess they've already had enough of going to school like normal teenagers.

'I went to school for one year. It was the best experience but the worst experience,' Willow admitted.

'The best experience because I was, like, "Oh, now I know why kids are so depressed." But it was the worst experience because I was depressed,' she added.

While Jaden took aim at Driver's Ed, suggesting that the amount of car accidents that happen prove school isn't working.

'You never learn anything in school. Think about how many car accidents happen every day. Driver’s ed? What’s up?' he said. 

'I mean, time for me, I can make it go slow or fast, however I please': Willow claims she can control time in a new interview with T Magazine

'I still haven’t been to driver’s ed because if everybody I know has been in an accident, I can’t see how driver’s ed is really helping them out.'

Jaden added: 'Here’s the deal: School is not authentic because it ends. It’s not true, it’s not real.'

'Our learning will never end. The school that we go to every single morning, we will continue to go to.'

Willow then rather bizarrely claims that time is a concept that she can control with her mind.

'I mean, time for me, I can make it go slow or fast, however I please,' she says. 'That’s how I know it doesn't exist.'

And despite only being fourteen years old, Willow already misses her days as a newborn.

'When they’re in the stomach, [babies are] so aware, putting all their bones together, putting all their ligaments together. But they’re shocked by this harsh world … As they grow up, they start losing.'

Discussing honesty, Willow goes on to suggest that she has started 'caring less and less about what your own mind thinks' in a bid to stop her feeling sad.

Jaden agrees by saying: 'Exactly. Because your mind has a duality to it. So when one thought goes into your mind, it’s not just one thought, it has to bounce off both hemispheres of the brain.' 

The pair also admitted that they do not think a lot of music 'out there' is cool while Willow claimed that because she doesn't like novels, she writes her own.

'Willow’s been writing her own novels since she was six', Jaden then says.
