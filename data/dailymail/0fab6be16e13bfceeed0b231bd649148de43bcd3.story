A study has discovered that early humans began hurling stone-tipped spears and darts at large prey at least 90,000 years ago.

There has been debate surrounding the precise date that early man began to use stone-tipped spears - with some experts suggesting their use as far back as 500,000 years ago -  but until now, evidence to prove theories had been lacking.

The throwing of spears was an important development because by throwing instead of 
thrusting, humans could hunt buffalo and other game from a 
safer distance, and with less risk of mauling.

By using a calibrated cross-bow, archaeologists replicated the indentations made in animal bone by stone-tipped spears. They discovered that the same indentations were found in bones at least 90,000 years old

Archaeologist Corey O'Driscoll, of South 
East Archaeology in Canberra, Australia, shaped flint reproductions of spear and
 arrow points from the Middle Stone Age in Africa and attached them to 
wooden shafts, according to a report in Science Now.

Together with a group of University of Queensland students, O'Driscoll ran
 15 experiments, throwing replica spears with 
bows or a calibrated crossbow at lamb and cow carcasses.

After boiling 
the carcasses or burying them for rapid defleshing by microbes and 
insects, he found 758 wounds on the bones, which he examined 
microscopically, and compared to 201 cut marks in an experimentally 
created reference collection of butchered animal bones.

The results showed 'quite a difference between the
 butchering marks and projectile impact marks,'  and revealed six types of distinctive projectile impact wounds, from drag 
marks to fracture marks and punctures.

Using the new technique, archaeologists discovered that the marks made 
by projectile  or thrown spears (left) were quite different from marks 
made by spears used to simple stab or cut into the bone (right)

O'Driscoll also noted that most 
projectile impact marks were located on vertebrae or rib bones and that 
17 per cent of the marks overall - and 50 per cent of the punctures - held 
microscopic fragments of stone from the flint points, due to the 
high speed of impact. By contrast, none of the butchering marks 
contained such stone fragments, another key distinction.

These findings prompted O'Driscoll and 
the University of Queensland's Jessica Thompson to take a new look at 
three bone specimens from large unidentified mammals - a rib and two 
vertebrae - from Pinnacle Point Cave in South Africa.

Using 
O'Driscoll's diagnostic criteria, the pair identified projectile impact 
marks on all three bones.

Experts have debated the precise date at which early man started to use stone-tipped spears for many years, but until now evidence to back up the various theories were lacking

Two dated to between 91,000 and 98,000 years 
ago and the third dated even earlier, between 153,000 and 174,000 years ago - making them the oldest direct evidence of the use of projectile 
weapons.

Archaeologist Tiina Manne at the 
University of Queensland also finds the identification of projectile 
impact marksâ€”at least on the two later bonesâ€”highly persuasive: 'This 
strongly suggests that projectile technology at Pinnacle Point was in 
use by at least 90 to 95,000 years ago,' she says. But she's less 
convinced by the evidence on the oldest bone, noting that only a 'single
 grain' of stone from the projectile point was embedded in the bone.

O'Driscoll's thesis will be 
published by the Australian Archaeological Association in June.

Experts have argued over the date at which early man first used stone-tipped spears, but there was very little evidence to back up various theories

But a technique developed by an Australian archeologist using replicas has shown humans used spears between 91,000 and 174,000 years ago
