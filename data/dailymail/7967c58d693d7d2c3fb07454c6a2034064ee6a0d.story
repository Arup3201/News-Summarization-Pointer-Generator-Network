An Alaska man who attempted to walk 50 miles between two villages in minus-35 degree weather was found in good shape with only four miles left in his trip.

Lawrence James, 52, began the journey at around 7pm Monday and walked about 46 miles in 15 hours in below freezing temperatures before a family member caught up to him, Alaska Dispatch News reports. 

'I've been wanting to do this for a while, so I just made up my mind and did it,' James told the Dispatch.

An Alaska man attempted to walk 50 miles in minus 35 degree weather from the Interior Alaska community of Birch Creek to Fort Yukon 

James told Michael Ivie Fort Yukon police officer, that he had a cousin who made the trek from the Interior Alaska community of Birch Creek to Fort Yukon a few years ago and he wanted to try it.

James had been drinking when he decided to embark on the journey risking encounter with moose and wolves. So, James' family alerted authorities after James left Birch Creek.

'He said his last drink kind of gave him that urge, that oomph,' Ivie told the News Miner. 

James, a Birch Creek native, told the Dispatch that he knew what he was getting himself into when he decided to begin the long journey in the harsh weather.

He brought a .22 rifle and a sled stocked with tea, water, sandwiches, a bag of jolly ranchers, and extra outerwear. 

'Our issue is that it was -30 or below, and he was by himself, and he was only carrying a little .22 rifle,' Ivie said, according to the Huffington Post. 'There were all sorts of possibilities that might have happened. 

'He could have been trampled by a moose or [attacked by] wolves.'

But, when James' cousin Weston Balaam caught up to him on his snowmachine, he found the man completely fine. 

Balam said he set out to find James at 10.30am Tuesday, more than 15 hours after James' began the journey. James was still walking when Balaam approached.

Balaam spotted James about four miles from Fort Yukon and the two rode on Balaam's snow machine the rest of the way. 

James was then taken to a medical clinic and was found to be uninjured.

'It was a good walk,' James told the Dispatch. 'It was good exercise.'
