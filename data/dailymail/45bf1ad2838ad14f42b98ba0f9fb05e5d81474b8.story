CNN's coverage of the Steubenville rape story has been roundly criticized after the cable news network focused on the devastating effect on the 'promising' lives of the rapists and not the 16-year-old victim.

As the breaking news of the guilty verdict against Steubenville High School football players Trent Mays, 17, and Ma'lik Richmond, 16, was relayed from the Ohio court-room on Sunday, anchor Candy Crowley turned to correspondent Poppy Harlow, who seemed more affected by the tearful reactions of the two teens.

Harlow described the scene in the court as, 'Incredibly difficult, even for me, to watch what happened as these two young men that had such promising futures, star football players, very good students, literally watched as they believed their lives fell apart.'

Candy Crowley broke the news to CNN viewers that Trent Mays, 17, and Ma'lik Richmond, 16, had been found guilty of rape on Sunday in Steubenville, Ohi

'One of the young men, Ma'lik Richmond, as that sentence came down, he collapsed,' added Harlow, saying that the rapist turned to his attorney and said, 'my life is over, no one is going to want me now.'

During the segment, CNN aired court-room video of Richmond in floods of tears over the verdict while he hugged his lawyer.

'I was sitting about three feet from Ma’lik when he gave that statement,' said Harlow. 'It was very difficult to watch.'

Social media immediately lit up with incredulous reaction to the tone of CNN's coverage about two young men who raped a severely intoxicated 16-year-old fellow student and who then swapped pictures and stories of the teen online in the days afterwards.

Viewers of the cable news network expressed their dismay over the tone of coverage as Crowley handed over to reporter Poppy Harlow in Ohio

Journalist Hadley Freeman of the Guardian was stunned, tweeting, 'Honestly, save for openly blaming the victim, it's hard to imagine how CNN could have covered the Steubenville verdict more ineptly.'

Members of the public were shocked too, with college student Jon Wainwright taking to Twitter to post, 'Crack job reporting the Steubenville rape @CNN. We should always worry about how a conviction will ruin the lives of rapists, not the raped.'

Outrage at the beleagured news networks coverage peaked when Crowley asked the resident CNN legal contributor Paul Callan for his opinion on the verdict for, 'a 16 year old, sobbing in court, regardless of what big football players they are, they still sound like 16 year olds.'

'There’s always that moment of just — lives are destroyed,' Callan remarked. 'But in terms of what happens now, the most severe thing with these young men is being labeled as registered sex offenders. That label is now placed on them by Ohio law.'

'That will haunt them for the rest of their lives.'

'Employers, when looking up their background, will see that they're registered sex offenders. When they move into a new neighborhood and somebody goes on the Internet, where these things are posted, neighbors will know that they are registered sex offenders.'

Twitter users were forthright in their opinions regarding the coverage CNN gave to the guilty verdict in the Steubenville, Ohio rape trial

Guardian journalist Hadley Freeman was appalled with how CNN lamented lamented that the 'promising' lives of the teenage rapists had been ruined

Other members of the public took the view that CNN had got their news angle for the trial wrong

Jamil Smith, a digital producer for MSNBC's Melissa Harris-Perry show was scathing about what he saw as terrible reporting, 'I hope CNN is embarrassed by the way in which they covered the #Steubenville verdict. No guarantees, though,'

Indeed, as both Steubenville High School students faced the reality of the consequences of what happened that August night last year, their remorse appeared overwhelming.

Both have been sentence to a minimum of one year in a juvenile detention institution with the maximum stay of until they are 21.

Mays faced an additional charge of the use and dissemination of nude images of a minor. He received the same sentence for that to run consecutively.

His minimum detention is two years.

His actions were, according to presiding Judge Lipps, ‘more egregious’ making it inappropriate that he should face the same sentence as Richmond.

Richmond’s father, Nathaniel, who has been present in court every day made his way over to his son, fell to his knees and told him that he loved him.

‘My life is ruined,’ Richmond told attorney his Walter Madison, who was clearly shocked at the verdict.

Mays father, Bryan, held his head in his hands as the defendant’s sister Rhiannan and mother wept.

Both defendants took the opportunity to address the victim and her family – present for the verdict and visible to the defendants but out of view of the main court in a screened off section of seating.

Mays was composed as he said: ‘I would like to apologize to [the victim] and her family, my family and the community. No pictures should have been sent let alone ever taken.’

But though Mays apologized quite specifically for taking pictures of the victim and sending them nowhere did he mention or offer an apology for the rape.

In every communication with the victim following the night of 11 -12 August he repeatedly denied raping her.

In fact in an incriminating detail it is an allegation he denies before it is ever made. Again and again his texts show him turning the blame on the victim, hectoring her, pressurizing her not to go to the police and telling her that the rape ‘didn’t happen.’

Crime: Mays and Richmond were today found guilty of digitally penetrating a 16-year-old West Virginia girl at a party last August

On the map: The working class town of Steubenville, located in eastern Ohio, has a population of around 18,000

Standing in court, convicted of that crime and filled with apparent regret, the rape remained a crime for which he does not apologize.

When it came to Richmond’s turn, he walked towards the victim and her family, across the courtroom, weeping; ‘I would like to apologize. I had no intention to put you guys through this. I’m sorry. I don’t know what to say.

‘I ruined her life.’

Across days of often appalling testimony the court has heard texts, tweets and emails between the defendants and their friends.

They have heard about pictures, been reminded of vile video rants and seen the reality of what these boys did and how they behaved, who they were, when nobody else was looking.

The case has scandalized America and scarred the small town of Steubenville, Ohio.

Mays and Richmond will begin their sentence today. They will be taken to an institute just northwest of Columbus, Ohio where they will be assessed and a decision made as to where they should spend their time in custody.
