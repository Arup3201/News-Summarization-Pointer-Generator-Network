Women at CNN are reportedly up in arms about the way the network permanently replaced one of its morning show anchors while she was on maternity leave.

CNN announced Friday that Kate Bolduan, who has been on leave from New Day since September, would be permanently replaced by Alisyn Camerota, who was filling in as co-anchor in her absence.

Page Six reports that staffers are upset that the network pushed out Bolduan while she was home with new baby and hold network head Jeff Zucker responsible for mishandling the switch.

'The manner in which Jeff did it is angering female staffers,' an unnamed insider told Page Six. 

'They took [Bolduan] out while she was on maternity leave and buried it on a day when there’s serious news.'  

The Wrap reported the show was experiencing a ratings boost with Camerota joining co-anchors Chris Cuomo and Michaela Pereira. 

The gossip site began reporting back in August that CNN had been quietly testing new co-anchors to pair with Cuomo on New Day.

The morning show had been consistently trailing Fox & Friends, averaging less than half of the Fox News show's ratings in the age 25-54 demographic.

The problem was reported to be a lack of chemistry between the co-anchors, with insiders talking of bickering between the three.

Still, it was expected that CNN would wait until Bolduan returned from spending time with new baby Cecilia to make any changes.

Bolduan will be moving to day-time television after her return on January 26, joining John Berman at 11 a.m. on @ThisHour. 

CNN has not yet returned a request for comment.
