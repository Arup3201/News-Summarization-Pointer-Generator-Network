This is the adorable moment a three-year-old Manchester United fanatic throws a tantrum when she learns her new school uniform is blue. 

Lilly Rae Doyle was getting ready for her first day at school in Wythenshawe when her mother, Faye Cummins, handed her the royal blue cardigan.

The toddler quickly breaks down in tears, refusing to sport the colours of her team's arch rivals, Manchester City.

Lilly Rae Doyle breaks down immediately after trying on the uniform for her first day at school as she does not like the colour blue 

Despite her mother's desperate pleas, the three-year-old is determined to avoid wearing the royal blue cardigan  

Her tantrum is filmed, with her shouting: 'I don't like blue, I want to get it off,' while trying on the primary school uniform. 

After pleading with the child that Manchester United sometimes wears a blue away strip, Ms Cummins and her partner Andrew Mitchell admit defeat. 

'I knew she wasn't going to be happy. She just loves United, she is such an avid fan and loves everything to do with them. It's always United, United, United,' said the 28-year-old bank worker. 

'We went to buy the uniform earlier this week and we thought once she had it on we might be able to talk her round. 

'It was a nightmare,I don’t know how we’re going to get on when it’s her first day at school because she’s not changing her mind. I don’t think it’s going to be easy.

'It’s tough to see my little girl upset but I’m sure she’ll get used to the new uniform. She’s so passionate about United and I think the video’s brilliant, I hope it’s something which will make other people smile as well.

Avid fan: The toddler's mother said she knew getting her into the blue uniform would be difficult 

Eventually Lilly Rae begins to calm down but is not easily talked out of her objections to the uniform 

Her mother tries everything to make her come round to the colour, and gently reminds her that even Manchester United wears blue sometimes too 

The toddler will have to wear the grey and blue uniform when she joins school later this month. Unsurprisingly, her favourite outfit is her red home strip (right) which she pairs with matching Doc Martens 

'Most of my family are City fans, it’s just me and my sister that are United. 

'They’ve all seen the video and they all think it’s quite funny, they’d much rather she was a Blue.'

Lilly Rae doesn’t have a favourite United player as she ‘loves them all the same’ and unsurprisingly lists her Manchester United shirt as her favourite item of clothing. 

She will be joining the school’s ‘Foundation Stage One’ pre-school class later this month.
