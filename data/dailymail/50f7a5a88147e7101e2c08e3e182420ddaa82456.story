Pep Guardiola is renowned throughout the world of football for his hard work and meticulous preparation, and that was evident again the morning after Sergio Aguero put his Bayern Munich side to the sword on Tuesday.

Bayern's official Twitter account uploaded pictures early on Wednesday of the squad boarding the team bus for a training session before they returned to Germany.

Guardiola was left reeling on Tuesday after Aguero fired a hat-trick against his side, including two goals in the final five minutes, as Manchester City stunned Bayern with a 3-2 victory.

The Germans tweeted on Wednesday morning: 'Training session for #Benatia & Co. in rainy Manchester first, before we head back to Munich this afternoon.'

Mehdi Benatia was sent off in the 20th minute for a foul on Aguero, who duly converted the penalty, and the defender was one of the players pictured heading to the bus.

Guardiola's side had already secured qualification from Group E before the encounter with City, but the former Barcelona manager clearly does not want the defeat to shake the confidence of his high-flying team.

They lead the Bundesliga by seven points already and will play Hertha Berlin on Saturday, seeking to bounce back from their loss to the Premier League champions.
