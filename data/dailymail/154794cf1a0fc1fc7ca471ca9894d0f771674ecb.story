Jim Mallinder played down injury concerns involving England forwards after Northampton beat Bath 31-24 in a pulsating Aviva Premiership match at Franklin’s Gardens. 

Courtney Lawes (shoulder) and Tom Wood (back) were forced to pull out of the Saints line-up prior to kick-off, while Alex Corbisiero went off 10 minutes after half-time holding a shoulder. 

Asked about Wood, Mallinder said: ‘He trained on Wednesday and on Friday but then he had a reaction from it. We’re hoping he will be right in the next week or two.’ 

On Corbisiero, he added: ‘He banged his shoulder but we hope it’s not too bad. Fingers crossed he’ll be fit for the trip down to face his old team, London Irish, next week.’

Northampton coach Jim Mallinder is confident his England forwards will be fit again soon

There were also fitness bulletins of interest to England head coach Stuart Lancaster at Allianz Park, after Saracens had beaten Sale 40-19. 

The hosts’ director of rugby, Mark McCall, insisted Owen Farrell (right) would soon return from a leg injury, saying: ‘We don’t expect him to be out for long. It’s a very minor strain and we’re looking at a couple of weeks, maximum.’

 Sarries’ stand-in captain Brad Barritt limped off in the first half with a calf strain, but McCall added: ‘To lose Brad so early wasn’t ideal but I don’t think it’s terribly serious.’

New Zealand won their third consecutive Rugby Championship title on Saturday when they beat Argentina 34-13 in La Plata. 

Julian Savea continued his scoring streak, while Israel Dagg, TJ Perenara and Ben Smith also touched down for the world champions. 

Meanwhile, in Christchurch, iconic All Black No 10 Dan Carter continued his comeback from injury by playing 40 minutes for Canterbury — slotting four kicks in a 28-26 defeat against Southland. In Cape Town, Australia led with 11 minutes left before conceding three tries to lose 28-10 to South Africa.
