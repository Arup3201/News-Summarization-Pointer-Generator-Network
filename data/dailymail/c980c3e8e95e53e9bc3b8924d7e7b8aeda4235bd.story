Meet the Australian photographer who captures the sense of serenity and magical moments of miniature waves, expressing its own unique personality with colours of rainbows, shapes and textures.

Deb Morris, who lives in Angourie, far north coast of NSW, shoots miniature waves that are impossible to surf from five to 30 centimetres in size at beaches across Northern NSW coastline.

The 49-year-old professional photographer told Daily Mail Australia that she bought her first camera at the age of 14, but it wasn't until three years ago when she turned her love for photography into a life long career.

Deb Morris started her professional photography career just three years ago where she captures the sense of serenity and magical moments of miniature waves

'Three years ago, I was wondering what to do, so I decided to pursue my dream of being a photographer,' she recalls.

'My father had a great passion for photography so I guess he inspired me to turn my hobby into a passion.'

'I rang a couple of friends who were in the photography industry and they said to "find a niche".'

After taking her first photograph of a micro wave on June 10 2011, she knew from that moment that she had unveiled her 'niche'.

'Growing up in Bondi, I was part of a surfing association so waves started me off in my career.

'Everyone always looks at the big waves and we tend to overlook the small waves but I think the small ones provide the fine details, give the same expression and makes us all think they're bigger than they really are in reality.

'I decided to challenge myself by working with anything under 30 centimetres - it's definitely taken me to where I'm at in my career now.

'All my photographs are taken raw, which means I don't use any water housing (waterproof) because it allows me to be more flexible and gives me the best results I want.

'So rather than just capturing frozen moments from this beautiful landscape, I have found a whole new hidden world to investigate, that of the micro or mini wave.

When asked what her favourite photograph was, she said the 'jewel' picture and it was also her first photograph she sold.

'I managed to capture the 20 centimetre barrel shot which was filled with colourful glitter of jewels and I entered it in the Nikon surf award where I was the first and only female competitor.

'It was also my first photograph I sold to someone who I didn't know - which assured me that I was on the right path.'

She added: 'Over 3000 images are now housed in my collection with each five to 30 centimetres waves still providing its own unique moment and a beautiful insight to the treasures of mother nature.'

Ms Morris said she was one of the 12 photographers selected worldwide for an environment themed exhibition held in Korea and hopes to be in the surf exhibition on the Gold Coast next year.

The photographer said she doesn't use water housing and all her photographs are taken raw. 'This shot makes you think it was taken under water'

The delicate lines and textures capture both break and the peak of the wave allowing for the rainbow of colours to shine through

Another amazing shot which was taken by her raw skills - tricking us to think that it was captured underwater

The colours and shape of this image reflect the perfection of the day where she captured the droplets falling off its tip just as it breaks

Ms Morris calls this the 'touchdown lick' where she has spent a lot of time focusing to capture the waves as close to perfect as they get

The condition had to be near perfect for the water to take on a glass sculpture appearance

Kaleidoscope of colours caught in the early hours one morning. Submerged in three foot of water, crouched in anticipation as the 10 centimetre wave formed into a tongue as if trying to reconnect with the ocean

This was taken at only 8 centimetre tall of the perfect barrell rolling through on the shoreline

Overcast conditions aided the metalic effect of this 8 centimetre wave as it curled itself back into the ocean

This would be one of the smallest barrells the photographer has captured, being of 5 centimetre in size, coloured by dirty waters from rain

Sun subtley shimmered one evening over the ocean, creating a metalic effect when with five centimetre wave curled. The photographer said she was on her knees, water to her waist, using no water housing as she captured this

The full midday sun beaming through the top of this 10 centimetre wave, which highlighted the exotic colours on show. Morris said: 'I was waste deep in water with no water housing as this glass formation touched down..'

Submerged two foot in water without water housing, slightly crouched in anticipation of what the approaching wave was going to do, as this 15 centimetre wave started to curl its way into the shoreline as she was able to capture the inner beauty

As this 15 centimetre wave crashes to shore, it presents itself as a main of hair with each strand being branded by a glow of the morning sun

Laying flat on the sand, a foot from the forming face of the wave with no water housing. Ms Morris said: 'I was able to capture the reflection of this 10 centimetre of wave tanned by the flood waters passing down river with the morning sun providing the perfect lighting
