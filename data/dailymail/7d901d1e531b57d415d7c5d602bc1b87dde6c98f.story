Andy Murray has revealed that his win at Wimbledon last year helped him pocket £8million.

The player picked up £1.6million after becoming the first Briton to take the men’s single title at the championships for 77 years.

It added to other prize money and lucrative sponsorship deals which have made him worth an estimated £32million over the course of his career.

But with this year’s championships starting today, 27-year-old Murray has admitted he has not always been astute in his financial affairs.

He said his biggest regret was buying a £135,000 Ferrari in 2009 which he sold after only six months because he felt self-conscious behind the wheel of the luxury sports car. ‘It had depreciated quite a bit when I sold it,’ he told the Sunday Times.

After fast cars, his greatest extravagance was private jets, he said. He uses a company called NetJets, which enables him to buy a share of a jet that can be used for a number of hours a year for a cost of up to £3million a year. ‘Private air travel sounds extravagant, but it saves so much hassle, especially flying between tournaments.’

Murray, who has lucrative sponsorship deals with sports companies Adidas and Head and Swiss watch-maker Rado, last week signed a multi-million-pound deal with Standard Life.

He owns a five-bedroom property with two double garages in Surrey, which he bought for £5million in 2009 and shares with his long-term girlfriend Kim Sears.

The player also owns two apartments in Miami worth several hundred thousand pounds which he and his coaching team use when he trains in the US.

And he recently bought a luxury hotel in Scotland, Cromlix, for £2million, which is close to where he grew up in Dunblane.

His other big expenditure is holidays. He said: ‘Being on the road so much and training all the time, we get to go on one or two really nice holidays a year where I can switch off. It’s vital for physical and mental recovery.’

Even the Morrisons in Wimbledon got into the tennis spirit - by changing its name to Murrisons in support of Andy Murray and other British tennis hopefuls. Last year the supermarket switched its sign to read 'Murriwins' after Andy's historic victory

Murray said his long-term financial goals were to plan for life after tennis and look after his family and friends. His advice on money was to ‘not to take it for granted, so to respect it’.

Meanwhile Virginia Wade has claimed she thought Murray was joking when he announced he had hired a female coach, France’s Amelie Mauresmo, 34.

Miss Wade, 68, the 1977 women’s singles Wimbledon champion, said: ‘Mauresmo was a total shock, I thought they were all fooling around. I think he’s maybe trying to mess with everybody.’

In 2012 Miss Wade accused Murray of being a ‘drama queen’ when his back gave way during a match at the French Open.

Asked last night if he was surprised by her comments, Murray said: ‘No. She’s done it a few times.’

Andy Murray stopped traffic as he came to the rescue of a dog running towards oncoming cars.

On his way to practice at the All England Club, the Scot made an unscheduled stop to save the labradoodle and then returned it to its owner.

Murray told BBC Radio Five Live: 'I was driving to practice and there was a dog running along the road.

'I parked the car and got out and tried to stop the traffic because the dog was running towards the oncoming traffic. I ran into the road, stopped the traffic and I managed to get the dog onto the back seat of my car.

'Then I drove to the place where all of the people walk their dogs, which is literally just round the corner.

'I called the number on the tag and amazingly my two dogs walk with that dog quite a lot. I met the owner and she was happy I'd picked it up.

'The dog was pretty strong, I don't think it really wanted me to grab it by the collar and put it in the car but thankfully the dog was fine and it's all good.'
