A rare white elephant has been captured after it was discovered roaming wild in a  jungle in Burma.

The seven-year-old female elephant was captured by forestry officials six weeks after it was spotted at a reserve in the western Ayeyarwaddy region.

The elephants have been revered for centuries in Asian nations including Burma, Thailand and Laos, and their appearance is said to bring good fortune, as well as herald political change.

'We had to be careful,' said Burma's forestry department spokesman Tun Tun Oo, who said the elephant had first been sighted in the Pathein township. 

'It's wild. We didn't want the elephant or the forestry department officials to get hurt.'

Often pinkish in color, with fair eyelashes and toenails, the animals are actually albinos.

They were normally kept and pampered by monarchs as a symbol of royal power and prosperity - and many people still believe they bring good luck to the country.

Previous white elephants transported from Myanmar's jungles have been heralded in lavish ceremonies in which military leaders sprinkle them with scented water laced with gold, silver and precious gems.

And in the 16th century  Thailand, then known as Siam, and Burma even went to war over the disputed ownership of four white elephants.

Burma currently has eight white elephants in captivity, most from the Ayeyarwaddy region. Five are in the zoo in the capital Naypyitaw, and three in Yangon. 

According to the World Wildlife Fund, there are between 25,600 and 32,750 Asian elephants remaining in the wild. 

Only males carry tusks and thus at risk from poachers who want them for their ivory.

The capture of wild elephants for domestic use has become a threat to wild populations.

India, Vietnam, and Burma have banned the capture of elephants in order to conserve wild herds, but in Burma elephants are still caught for the timber industry or the illegal wildlife trade, according to charity the WWF.
