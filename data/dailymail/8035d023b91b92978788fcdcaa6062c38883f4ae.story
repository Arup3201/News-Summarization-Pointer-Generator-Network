A five-year-old boy helped save his father's life when he suffered a stroke while driving, after calmly guiding police to their car on Sunday.

Oregon police were having trouble finding Richard Paget, but the 46-year-old's son, Dax, was able to give a detailed description of where his father had pulled over.

The father and son, from Spokane, Washington, had been driving to Oregon City at about 7.30am when Dax called his mother to say Mr Paget was sick.

Rachael Ballard, who was at home at the time, contacted the police who were able to use her husband's cell phone signal to track him to a 15-mile radius, according to ABC News.

When they called the phone, Mr Paget's speech was too garbled but five-year-old Dax confidently took the phone and clearly answered officer's questions.

'I don't have kids, but when I do I hope
 they turn out like Dax,' Oregon State Police Trooper Joseph Dezso said. 'He is a super brave, super intelligent little man.'

He added: '[Dax] immediately started talking to me about where they were and what was going on. He started leading us in the right direction.'

Showing remarkable calm for a young boy, Dax described to officers where their car was parked, telling them there were some buildings nearby and a railway track a train had just traveled down.

He was able to tell them the color of the buildings and where they had been driving, to help officers pinpoint their car.

More importantly, he was able to relay information about his father's symptoms, telling police he could not wake his father up and that Mr Paget had lost feeling in the right side of his face and body.

The details of the railway track in particular helped officers find Mr Paget's location and rush to his aid.

Life saver: Police say the calm five-year-old's accurate descriptions helped them find his father quickly

'Everything that he answered was spot 
on. Where they were at, there were only a couple of 
buildings around them, and [Dax] described them in detail. That, along 
with the fact that the train was passing by, was very helpful for us to 
get there as quickly as we could,' police spokesman Gregg Hastings said.

When
 an officer found their car, Dax was waiting with his father who had 
lost all ability to speak, was drifting out of consciousness and was 
unable to move one side of his body.

Mr Paget was rushed to hospital, where he is said to be in a satisfactory condition, according to ABC News.

While
 an ambulance crew helped his father, Dax was allowed to sit in Trooper 
Dezso's car and was driven back to the police station while Mr Paget was
 taken to hospital.Â 

Despite
 the dramatic start to their day, Mr Paget's son still wants to be a 
police officer and enjoyed spending time with the trooper, his mother 
told KEPRTV.

'He is a very bright young man and 
definitely saved his dad's life. We are so glad to hear his father 
should pull through,' Trooper Dezso said.

Mrs Bardwell had only recently showed Dax how to unlock a phone and call his parents if there was an emergency.

She said he was able to remember her instructions and alert her to the problem with his father.
