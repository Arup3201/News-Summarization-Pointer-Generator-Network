Indonesia's president Joko Widodo has said abolishing the death penalty is possible, but this provides no hope for Andrew Chan and Myuran Sukumaran. 

In an exclusive interview with Al Jazeera, Widodo shared his views on Indonesia's drug problem, executions, religion and economy.

He democratically confirmed that if the people of Indonesia wished to abolish the death penalty, then it was more than possible.

'I think we are heading there,' he said.

'We want to hear what the people want, their opinion and it's a long process.' 

When asked on whether he had any remorse for the current 64 drug traffickers inevitably facing death row, including Chan and Sukumaran, Widodo defended his decision on denying them clemency.

'We want to send a strong message to drug smugglers that Indonesia is firm and serious in tackling the drug problem and one of the consequences is execution,' he said.

'The court has sentenced them and we cannot discriminate between countries.' 

The Indonesian president justified his hard stance on the issue by stating that there are 4.5 million people in the country affected by drugs and this paints a grim picture for the future generations of Indonesia. 

However, he would not comment on whether he is a personal supporter of the death penalty. 

Al Jazeera's Step Vassen asked Widodo if he believes he is portraying a double standard by trying to free Indonesian drug traffickers who are facing the death penalty in other countries.

'No... As head of state of course I am going to try and save my citizens from execution,' he said.

'That's my obligation as a president, to protect my citizens.'

Tony Abbott revealed that he had again reached out to Joko Widodo to directly speak to him regarding the fate of Chan and Sukumaran.

He is still waiting for a response.

'At this stage, it hasn't been able to be arranged,' he told reporters in Sydney.

The executions of Bali Nine duo Andrew Chan and Myuran Sukumaran were due as early as the weekend but have been delayed until all legal avenues have been exhausted, prompting fresh hope of a 'change of mind' from Foreign Minister Julie Bishop.

A spokesperson from the office of  Muhammad Prasetyo, Indonesia's attorney-general, confirmed on Friday afternoon that the government had placed the executions on hold.

The planned executions of Australians Myuran Sukumaran, 33, and Andrew Chan, 31, have ramped up diplomatic tension between Australia and Indonesia

Spokesman Tony Spontana said that no time frame could be placed on the legal processes, which may include a challenge to court decisions and further appeals. 

Australia's Foreign Minister Julie Bishop said that the delay may be the result of 'other reasons', but that she hoped the postponement showed a 'change of mind' by the Indonesian government, reported The ABC. 

Despite the postponement, Chan and Sukumaran will not be able to see their families until next week, with the earliest opportunity for visiting hours coming on Monday and Wednesday. 

After planning for weeks to execute 10 prisoners at once and keep them on Nusakambangan for as little time as possible, he now won't say how many will go to the firing squad and has speculated about a 10-day delay.

On Friday, artist Ben Quilty, who has been an outspoken ally of the Bali Nine duo, posted a challenge to Indonesia's president Joko Widodo, accompanying a photograph of Sukumaran being escorted by heavily armed authorities.

'Why the Special Force soldiers? Myu is not a terrorist. He is not even mildly dangerous. He was a self indulgent kid,' Quilty wrote.

'But now he is a quiet, dignified, young man. He is an artist. He is humble and generous and kind. Who are you Joko Widodo?'

Australia's Prime Minister Tony Abbott on Friday lashed Bali police for posing with the condemned men in photos that turned up in Indonesian media, calling them 'unbecoming'. 

There are a total of 10 death row drug dealers slated to be executed simultaneously, Chan, Sukumaran, an Indonesian, a Filipino woman and six other male foreigners.
