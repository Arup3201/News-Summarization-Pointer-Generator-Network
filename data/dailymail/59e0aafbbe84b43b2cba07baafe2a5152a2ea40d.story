A judge in Egypt has dismissed 'irrelevant' evidence against three journalists accused of terrorist links after it included footage of donkeys at an animal hospital.

The Al Jazeera journalists, including former BBC correspondent Peter Greste, have been paraded in cages charged with altering footage to support the Muslim Brotherhood in a trial which Amnesty International condemned today as a 'vindictive farce'.

Today the court watched the first tranche of video evidence found on the journalists' flash drives and computers - which included clips about an animal hospital with donkeys and horses, and footage about Christian life in Egypt.

Defence lawyers and even the judge dismissed the videos as irrelevant, while Greste shouted from a cage in the Cairo courtroom: 'This is a complete joke.'

None of the clips appeared to have any connection to terrorism, and none of them were Al-Jazeera footage.

'This clearly does not contain anything supporting the case,' said presiding judge Mohammed Nagi Shehata after the footage was aired.

Khaled Abu Bakr, Fahmy's lawyer, mocked the prosecutors and claimed they had not watched the footage before submitting it as evidence.

The three journalists - Greste, Canadian-Egyptian acting bureau chief Mohammed Fahmy and Egyptian Baher Mohammed - have been detained since December 29 last year.

The three journalists were arrested after the military backed government of Egypt declared the Muslim Brotherhood a terrorist organisation, in their Cairo hotel where they had set up a temporary office

They are accused of being part of a terrorist group and airing falsified footage to damage Egyptian national security.

Egyptian authorities accuse Qatari-owned network Al-Jazeera of providing a platform for the Muslim Brotherhood, which the government has branded a terrorist organisation.

Al-Jazeera denies the claim, and the defendants deny being members of the Brotherhood, saying they were simply doing their job reporting on Egypt's political turmoil.

'This is a politicized trial and a politicized judge,' Fahmy shouted from the courtroom cage.

He said prosecutors had told him privately that he and his co-defendants 'are paying the price' for tensions between Egypt and Qatar.

Protest: Hundreds of BBC employees demonstrated outside the Corporation's London headquarters on Monday to mark 100 days since the arrest of the three journalists, including a former BBC correspondent

Anger: Peter Greste worked for the BBC in Afghanistan, Latin America and Africa

'I want to get out of this place... I am going to expose all of this,' he shouted. 'There are crimes against humanity taking place. Nothing is right in this system.'

Besides the three journalists, 17 others are charged in the case, but only five are present and the rest are being tried in their absence.

Prosecutors are expected to present more videos in later sessions.

'What the Egyptian authorities are doing is vindictive persecution of journalists for merely doing their jobs'

- Amnesty International

Shortly after the court session started today, one of the other defendants, Khaled Abdel-Raouf, collapsed after complaining he had been in hunger strike because he was being denied medical care and visitors in prison.

Dozens of defendants in several Brotherhood-related cases have gone on hunger strike over similar conditions.

Last month a judge sentenced 529 people to death for alleged Brotherhood links in a case that was condemned around the world.

Today Amnesty International condemned the trial as a 'vindictive farce'.

Hassiba Hadj Sahraoui, Amnesty’s Middle East and North Africa Programme Deputy Director, said: 'What the Egyptian authorities are doing is vindictive persecution of journalists for merely doing their jobs.

'So far, the Prosecution has failed to produce any convincing evidence and the journalists appear to be pawns in the hands of the authorities in their ongoing dispute with Qatar. 

'The truth is that Mohamed Fahmy, Peter Greste and Baher Mohamed are prisoners of conscience who must be released immediately and unconditionally.

In an unusual move, the judge, Mohammed Nagi Shehata, eventually allowed the defendants to approach the bench to deliver their pleas in a previous hearing

'This trial is nothing more than posturing by the authorities to gain public support.

'This farce must end and the charges against the three men must be dropped.'

Peter Greste worked for the BBC in Afghanistan, Latin America and Africa, and has won awards for his work.

Australian Journalist Peter Greste had only been in the country for two weeks before being arrested

The 45-year-old Australian, who works 
for Arab TV channel Al Jazeera, describes the charges as ‘preposterous’ 
and an international campaign has been launched to secure his 
release.

The defendents have previously been asked to be released on bail but the judge denied their request.  

At a previous hearing Mr Greste told the judge he had been in Egypt for only two weeks before his arrest.

‘The
 idea that I could have an association with the Muslim Brotherhood is 
frankly preposterous,’ he said.

‘Our only desire at this point is to 
continue to fight and clear our names from outside of prison.’

Al
 Jazeera English bureau chief Mohamed Fahmy, who holds dual 
Canadian-Egyptian citizenship, also denied links to the Muslim 
Brotherhood, saying he was an alcohol-drinking liberal who had lived 
abroad for a long time.

‘Have you ever heard of a Muslim terrorist that drinks alcohol?’ he asked.

Other defendants claimed they had been abused and tortured during interrogation.

Mr
 Greste’s parents had hoped he would be released after Australian Prime 
Minister Tony Abbott took up the case with interim Egyptian President 
Adly Mansour.

Many of the defendants have claimed the conditions in the Egyptian holding cells are akin to Guantanamo Bay, with one defendant asking for bail so that he could attend a private hospital for a broken arm
