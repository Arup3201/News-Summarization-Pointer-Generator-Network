Arsenal are stepping up interest in Southampton right-back Calum Chambers.

Manager Arsene Wenger has admired the 19-year-old for some time and has had favourable scouting reports throughout the season.

Although he has bought Mathieu Debuchy from Newcastle, he is allowing Carl Jenkinson to leave and that will vacate room for Chambers.

Wanted man: Arsenal are stepping up interest in Southampton right-back Calum Chambers

Opposite direction? Serge Gnabry is wanted by the Saints as they begin rebuilding for this season

Southampton have an interest in Arsenal midfielder Serge Gnabry while Liverpool's Martin Kelly is understood to be on their radar also.

Manager Ronald Koeman believes he can find better players than some of the ones he has sold but will be sorry to lose Chambers who he has had good reports on.

Koeman wants a goalkeeper also. He is reluctant to pay the £12-15m Cardiff have quoted for David Marshall while Celtic want at least £8m for Fraser Forster. That has pushed Norwich and England keeper John Ruddy into the frame who is also on Arsenal's list if they fail to sign David Ospina from Nice.

Arsenal are holding out hope they can persuade Sami Khedira to join them from Real Madrid despite Chelsea's interest.

Real Madrid also maintain that Manchester United have asked to be kept informed.

United are advanced in talks for Arturo Vidal at Juventus but made an offer for Khedira last summer. However, the German is keen to play Champions League football and has close friends at Arsenal while knowing Jose Mourinho well also from his time at Madrid.
