A homeowner has won a two-year battle to get a giant TV screen installed by the BBC directly outside his flat turned off at night - after it left him unable to sleep.

James Board, 36, complained that the 'Big Screen' in Cardiff city centre filled his home with bright flickering light, making it resemble a 'disco' at night.

The 270ft sq TV, which shows sports events and concerts daily directly opposite his flat, is now switched off at 8.30pm after he protested to the council.

Battle: James Board, 36, has won his battle to have a giant BBC-installed TV screen outside his flat shut down at night. He said flashing lights from the device had left him unable to sleep

'My house becomes like a disco because the whole apartment is illuminated,' said Mr Board.

'It's not home - anyone will they lose the ability to relax because it just drives you mad. It's a form of torture and it's relentless.'

The giant TV screen was one of 22 installed by the BBC around Britain a year after he moved in and was kept on until 11pm.

The screens show news, live coverage of BBC sport and music events, highlights of BBC programmes plus local community, sporting and cultural events.

But the council - which has owned the screen in Cardiff since December - has now agreed to turn it off in the evening from 8.30pm following Mr Board's determined campaign.

'I would challenge anybody to have a screen erected outside their home and to have light every evening emanating in to their house,' said Mr Board. 'It's the only topic of conversation when people come round.

Agreement: Cardiff City Council, which now owns the screen, has agreed to turn it off at 8.30pm each night

Overlooked: The screen was one of 22 installed by the BBC nationwide ahead of the London Olympics

'All they talk about is the fact that the walls are changing colour and you have to draw the curtains constantly -Â  you come back in at 8pm and as I walk in you've got the light changing on the walls and the carpet.'

A council spokesman said: 'We are aware of and are sympathetic to the resident's concerns. As a result [we] have already curtailed the sound and operating times of the screen.

'We have arranged for the screen to be switched off at dusk. A full review of the future operation of the screen is being undertaken and the resident's view will be taken into account when final decisions are taken regarding the screen's future.'
