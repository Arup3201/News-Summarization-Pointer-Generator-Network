Washington state issued its first retail marijuana licenses on 
Monday, in a series of middle-of-the-night emails alerting bleary-eyed 
pot-shop proprietors that they will finally be able to open for 
business.

'We're pretty stoked,' said John Evich, an investor in 
Bellingham's Top Shelf Cannabis, in a 2.30am PT interview. 'We haven't 
had any sleep in a long time, but we're excited for the next step.'

Randy
 Simmons, the state Liquor Control Board's project manager for legal 
marijuana, said on Sunday night that the first two dozen stores were 
being notified so early in order to give them an extra few hours to get 
cannabis on their shelves before they are allowed to open their doors at
 8am on Tuesday – an opening that is expected to be accompanied by high 
prices, shortages and rationing.

The issuance of the retail licenses marked a major step that has been 20 months in the making. Washington and Colorado stunned most of the world by voting in November 2012 to legalise marijuana for adults over 21, 
and to create state-licensed systems for growing, selling and taxing the
 pot. Sales began in Colorado on 1 January.

It remained unclear 
how many of the pot-shops being licensed in Washington planned to open 
on Tuesday. Officials eventually expect to have more than 300 
recreational pot shops across the state.

At Cannabis City, which 
will be the first and, for now, only recreational marijuana shop in 
Seattle, owner James Lathrop worked into the night on Sunday placing 
no-parking signs in front of his building, hoisting a grand-opening 
banner and hanging artwork before he turned his attention to his email –
 and the official notification that he was a licensed marijuana dealer.

'I've
 had a long day. It really hasn't sunk in yet,' he said early on Monday.
 He planned to hold off on opening his store until noon on Tuesday.

'Know your audience: we're talking stoners here,' he said.

'I'd be mean to say they need to get up at 5am to get in line.'

With
 the emailed notifications in hand, the shops immediately worked to 
place their orders with some of the state's first licensed growers.

As 
soon as the orders were received, via state-approved software for 
tracking the bar-coded pot, the growers could place the product in a 
required 24-hour 'quarantine' before shipping it early on Tuesday 
morning.

The final days before sales have been frenetic for 
growers and retailers alike.

Lathrop and his team hired an events 
company to provide crowd control, arranged for a food truck and free 
water for those who might spend hours waiting outside, and rented a 
portable toilet.

At Nine Point Growth Industries, a marijuana 
grower in Bremerton, owner Gregory Stewart said he and his director 
celebrated after they worked through some glitches in the pot-tracking 
software early on Monday and officially learned they would be able to 
transport their weed 24 hours later, at 2.22am on Tuesday.

'It's 
the middle of the night and we're standing here doing high-fives and our
 version of a happy dance,' he said. 'It's huge for us.'

Pot 
prices were expected to reach $25 a gram or higher on the first day of 
sales – twice what people pay in the state's unregulated medical 
marijuana dispensaries. That was largely due to the short supply of 
legally produced pot in the state. Although more than 2,600 people 
applied to become licensed growers, fewer than 100 have been approved – 
and only about a dozen were ready to harvest by early this month.

Nevertheless,
 Evich said his shop in Bellingham wanted to thank the state's residents
 for voting for the law by offering $10 grams of one cannabis strain to 
the first 50 or 100 customers. The other strains would be priced between
 $12 and $25, he said.

In Seattle, among those who planned to buy 
some of the first pot at Cannabis City was Alison Holcomb, the lawyer 
who drafted Washington's law. She said it was a good opportunity to 
remind people of the big-picture arguments for ending nearly a century 
of prohibition and displacing the black market, including keeping 
non-violent, adult marijuana users out of jail; redirecting profits away
 from criminal groups; and ending racial disparities in who gets busted.

'No
 one thought legalisation could happen in our lifetime,' she said. 'I 
think this is going to be a little overwhelming for me.'
