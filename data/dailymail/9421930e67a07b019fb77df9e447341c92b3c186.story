A female gorilla tenderly cares for her baby in the rainforest of the Republic of Congo while its father looks on in this touching series of photographs.

The baby gorilla is seen nestling into the female western lowland gorilla's chest for a feed, while in another picture the newborn takes a ride on her back as she makes her way around the Odzala-Kokoua National Park.

And with the doting female diligently watching from the ground, the young primate was also photographed climbing a tree to forage for food.

Father: The baby's 31 stone father, called Neptuno, watched the mother and child from a few feet away

The pictures of the critically endangered gorillas were taken by wildlife photographer James Weis, who also managed to a capture a magnificent portrait of the 31 stone dominant male called Neptuno staring down his camera lens.

Mr Weis, 52, from Chicago, US, was on a guided trek through the dense and pristine rainforest to find the family group named after its impressive silverback leader and protector.

'The trekking was relatively easy compared with the mountain gorilla treks but the low level foliage makes getting clear shots a bit challenging,' said Mr Weis, who also runs a tour company called Eyes on Africa and had to take the pictures in complete silence so as not to disturb theanimals.

Family: The gorillas pictured are part of the 'Neptuno' family, named for its dominant silverback

'We trekked through the forest with expert local trackers and a guide to locate the gorillas.

'We spent one hour of magical time watching and photographing them as they foraged high in the trees and on the forest floor for fruits, ants, and leaves.

'The gorillas in these photos are part of the "Neptuno" family, named for its dominant silverback.

'The female with her baby allowed us to witness their intimate time together - a special privilege and a testament to the comfort they felt with our presence.'

Western lowland gorillas are found in central western Africa.

Their exact number is not known because they inhabit some of the continent's densest and most remote rainforests, although it has been estimated to be 95,000.

Due to poaching and disease, including Ebola, it is estimated that the population has declined by more than 60 per cent over the last 25 years.
