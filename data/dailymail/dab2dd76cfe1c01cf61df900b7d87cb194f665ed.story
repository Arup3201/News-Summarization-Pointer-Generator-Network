The owner of this waterlogged camera 
must have thought it was gone for ever, along with his precious holiday 
pictures, when he dropped it in the ocean.

But a year later a diver spotted it 
rusting away in the depths and rescued it. Even more astonishingly, he 
was able to recover the pictures and post them on Google+.

Now, thanks to the wonders of social networking, the owner - an unnamed Canadian fireman - has his holiday photos back.

Wildlife
 photographer Markus Thompson was scuba diving off Vancouver, British 
Columbia, when he stumbled upon the strange sight – an expensive digital 
camera lodged in Deep Bay.

Water damage: But Mr Thompson was able to recover pictures from the memory card, which he posted on Google+

Back on dry land Mr Thompson examined the SD memory card and was able to recover 50 photos.

He then posted messages on Google+ asking if anyone had accidentally dropped the Canon EOS 1000D.

Mr Thompson wrote: ‘Approximately 50 
pictures on the card from a family vacation.

'If you know a fire fighter 
from British Columbia whose team won the Pacific Regional Firefit 
competition, has a lovely wife and (now) 2 year old daughter – let me 
know. I would love to get them their vacation photos.’

Social
 networking sleuths began their detective work. Images 
recovered from the camera showed a regional fire fighting competition. 
Faces were compared, and the options were slowly narrowed down.

The
 search went viral – Mr Thompson received thousands of comments and shares – but 
it was only after he received an email from a friend of the 
owner that the mystery of the camera was solved.

Detective work: The search for the camera's owner took only days after Mr Thompson posted photos he found on its memory card on the social networking site Google+

The friend, who signed the 
email simply as ‘Hilary,’ wrote: ‘Hello Mark. Thank you so much for the 
email. Yes I know exactly who the camera belongs to! He is a Delta Fire 
Fighter. I will have him contact you.’

On his Google+ page, Mr Thompson details how he conducted his search, which included contacting local firefighters.

He also contacted Canon Canada with the serial number of the camera, but they said they had no record of the number.

Water-logged: The DSLR, which was submerged since August 2010, no longer works

Mr Thompson said he tried to 
conduct the search on Facebook as well. ‘It received one ‘like’ – that’s
 it (there’s a reason I left)’ he wrote.

The camera – which can cost upwards of $500 new – was lost by the British Columbia firefighter in August 2010.

Not surprisingly, it no longer works.
