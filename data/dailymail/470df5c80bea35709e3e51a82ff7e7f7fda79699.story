Punishment: Village elders who shaved a teenage girl's head after she was kidnapped because she'd made herself 'too attractive'

Village elders who shaved a teenage girl's head after she was kidnapped by her uncle as his new bride have told police in central India their punishment was fair because she'd made herself 'too attractive'.

The 18-year-old girl had been snatched while she was shopping in Chikhla, Madhya Pradesh state, and elders say they cut off her hair to make her 'less of a temptation.'

The girl was subjected to the hair cutting ritual in front of the elders despite pleading with them and telling them that her uncle had kidnapped her from the village market.

Whilst the girl protested - the men in the crowd shouted insults at the 18-year-old.

Her 53-year-old uncle who is married with two children of his own was forced to walk around the village wearing a garland of shoes, a sign of disrespect in India and a 'grinding stone' attached to his chest as his punishment.

The police confirmed that in total 16 elders are being investigated for being part of the group who gave out the 'punishment' to the girl.

Thirteen of those have been arrested and the other three are still being searched for by the police.

A police spokesman said: "We are investigating an alleged assault.

'A number of people have been arrested and we are still tracking others down. We are treating this allegation of assault very seriously and will then decide what action to take.'

Police only intervened when they were 
tipped off after the girl's family spoke out against the so called 
'panchayat' punishments - - a form of 'tribal government' - which choose
eldersÂ  from the local community to govern the community.

However many villagers protested yesterday against the police investigation in front of the Superintendent of Police, claiming the villagers action is justified as it is 'tradition'.

Traditionally in some Indian regions these panchayat assemblies settled disputes between individuals and villages, and in many often remote areas the tradition lives on.

In some cases the Panchayat's decision is even legally binding and cannot be overturned.
