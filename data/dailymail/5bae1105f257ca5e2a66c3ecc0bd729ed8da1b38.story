Timothy Foley allegedly entered his neighbour's home and shot him in the head then wounded two state troopers who responded to the 911 call

A gunman blasted a neighbour in the head before shooting two state troopers who responded to the 911 call, according to police.

Officers in Vermont said the man crossed a street in Leicester, south-west of state capital Montpelier, before opening fire early on Sunday morning.

At around 3am a 
woman called 911 to say that she and her husband had been in bed when 
someone entered their home and shot the husband in the head.

Troopers were led across the street to the home of 47-year-old Timothy Foley.

After speaking to him by phone, Vermont State Police say Foley fired 
at the officers from inside the house, hitting two troopers in the head 
with shotgun pellets.

They were able to move to a safe area 
and were taken to the hospital, where one was treated and released and 
the other was admitted for non-life threatening injuries.

After the shooting, the state police 
hostage negotiation team was able to speak with Foley by phone and 
persuade him to leave the home.

He agreed and was taken into custody 
without incident. It was unclear whether he had a lawyer.

The first victim was in stable condition at Fletcher Allen Medical Center, wcvb.com reported.

Foley, from Leicester, was arrested around 6am, three hours after the incident. Authorities were still determining which charges he would face.

Authorities have not released the names of the victim or the troopers involved.
