Few gave the marriage between the socialite daughter of a disgraced Tory Minister and a Sikh ‘warrior’ much chance of success.

But confirmation that the union between Alexandra Aitken and Inderjot Singh is indeed over has been overshadowed by claims from her controversial father that it was never a real marriage at all.

Alexandra, 34, was best known as a party-loving socialite before becoming a Sikh and marrying an Indian law graduate she spotted at a temple.

Socialite Alexandra Aitken's marriage to her Sikh ‘warrior’ husband Inderjot Singh appears to be over

The unlikely couple wed near the Sikh holy city of Amritsar in 2010 and three years later their relationship was reported to be on the rocks.

Now former MP Jonathan Aitken has spoken about his daughter’s ‘marriage’ and stirred up controversy which is unlikely to go down well in his daughter’s adopted home.

Speaking last week, Mr Aitken said: ‘They were not married and they are now detached.

‘It was more a colourful, folklore ceremony than a proper ceremony. I think both sides know the marriage is over, if it ever was a marriage. Their position is they are not married.’

Mr Aitken, 72, who was jailed in 1999 for perjury and perverting the course of justice, said his daughter remains in India, enjoying life as a follower of the Sikh religion.

He added: ‘She has a devout, happy life near Amritsar living as a Sikh and is supported by her parents.’

After years being photographed outside nightclubs and doing modelling work, Alexandra’s sudden conversion and love story shocked many close to her.

The couple’s marriage was attended by more than 300 people at dawn – the holiest time of day in the Sikh religion. Extra blessings are said to come to couples who get married just before sunrise.

Under Indian law the ceremony – called Anand Karaj – is legal under legislation passed by an act of parliament.

Perhaps Mr Aitken’s doubts stem from his absence from the ceremony in October 2010. The bride’s twin sister Victoria was there but she was sworn to secrecy and her parents weren’t told until later.

Alexandra had moved to Amritsar in northern India after apparently having a dream about a Sikh who would change her life.

She noticed her future husband at the Golden Temple and spent a week beside him without exchanging a single word.

She later said she knew she was ‘blindly in love’ and returned to the city a few weeks later to be introduced to him.

Alexandra rapidly adopted Sikh traditions, refusing to cut her hair or even wax her eyebrows, using only a wooden comb and carrying a ceremonial knife.

Recalling the moment she first saw her future husband, she said: ‘I was sitting on the roof of the Golden Temple at about 3am, and the most beautiful man I’d ever seen in my whole life walked in.

‘He seemed 100 per cent man, gentle and intuitive and poetic and sensitive, but also extraordinarily strong and manly.

‘And you don’t see many of these around. So I was like: “Oh wow!”’

Speaking about how her father took news of the marriage, she said in an interview: ‘When I said, “Daddy, I might be wearing a turban next time you see me”, it was a bit of a shock.

‘But my father loves my husband - it’s impossible not to. He’s happy for us.’
