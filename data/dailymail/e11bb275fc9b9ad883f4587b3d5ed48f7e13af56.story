An unlicensed doctor suspected of negligently infecting more than 100 villagers in northwestern Cambodia with HIV has been charged with murder and other crimes.

Yem Chhrin was charged with murder carried out with cruelty, intentionally spreading HIV - human immunodeficiency virus - and practicing medicine without a license.

Health officials say 106 people out of more than 800 tested in Roka village were found to have the virus.

A team of specialists, including experts from the U.S. and the UN, have been sent to Cambodia's Battambang province (pictured) to determine the scope of the HIV transmission

Yem Chhrin is being held pending further investigation, although officials have declined to say what penalty might be applied for the crimes. Cambodia has no death sentence.

Cambodia's prime minister Hun Sen last week appealed to villagers not to lynch Yem Chhrin, who was later taken into protective custody and then arrested at the weekend.

Seng Loch, a senior provincial police officer, said the suspect acknowledged reusing syringes for treatment of patients, a practice that can spread HIV.

Mr Seng Loch said: 'He told us that he had no intention of spreading HIV to villagers. He doesn't know who among his patients was infected with HIV.

He added that Yem Chhrin claimed to frequently change the needles he used for injections.

The police officer said that the 53-year-old had been popular in the community because of his kindness and health care treatments, which he had been carrying out for many years even though he had no formal medical training or certification.

Cambodian media have reported that the infected villagers range in age from 3 to 82 years old and include Buddhist monks.

The Health Ministry said in a statement last week that a team including experts from U.S. and UN agencies had been sent to Battambang province 'to determine the source, extent and chain of transmission of HIV infection.'

Cambodia had a high HIV prevalence rate of 2.0 percent in 1998, but an aggressive campaign to promote safe sex brought the figure down to an estimated 0.7 percent this year, according to the U.N. agency that spearheads the worldwide fight against AIDS.
