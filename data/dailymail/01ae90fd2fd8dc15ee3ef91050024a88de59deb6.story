A gang of thieves used gas bombs to blow up dozens of cash machines across the country and steal £800,000.

The seven men targeted cash machines across the North West and Midlands, using gas bombs to blow them open and cause hundreds of thousands of pounds of damage. 

They have been jailed for a total of 114 years and police are hunting for two further suspects who they believe were involved in the raids.

A gang of seven men used gas bombs to blow up cash machines in the Midlands so they could steal £800,000

As they targeted cash machines the gang even accidentally blew up £20,000 in the process and could easily have harmed people nearby.  

The group targeted 28 cash machines at banks, post offices and supermarkets in Wirral, Lancashire, Cheshire, Southport, Liverpool, Prescot, Loughborough, Gloucester, Birmingham, Northampton and Derby. 

Around £800,000 was stolen and the raids caused around £485,000 worth of damage to the buildings where gas bombs were used to prise open the cash machines.

Their hideout was in Huyton and experts said anyone standing within 100 metres of the blasts would have been killed, the Liverpool Echo reported. 

Adam Murphy and Andrew White, are wanted for conspiracy to cause explosions at cash machines and burglary of bank and shop premises between January 2013 and December 2013.

Police are appealing for help in finding the two men who are now on the force's most wanted list. 

Adam Murphy, 29, is described as being white of a medium build with short brown hair and blue eyes. His last known address is Waresley Crescent in Liverpool. Detectives believe Murphy may be in Scotland.

Andrew White, 25, is described as being white of a medium build with fair hair and blue eyes. His last known address is Nyland Road in Huyton. White has links to Spain.

Detective Chief Inspector Gayle Rooney, from the Matrix Serious Organised Crime Team, said: 'The Force is once again asking the public for their help in catching two of Merseyside's most wanted criminals.
