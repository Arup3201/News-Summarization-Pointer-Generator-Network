For ten years the twin rovers, Spirit and Opportunity, have been sending back stunning pictures as they explore the surface of Mars.

The rovers have taken hundreds of thousands of images as they journeyed round the red planet, many of which have led to scientific discoveries.

A selection of the images, showing sweeping deserts, dusty craters and strange rock formations, have been selected for an exhibition celebrating the mission.

This composite image shows a self-portrait that was taken by the rover Opportunity weeks before its tenth landing anniversary on Mars. The rover's panoramic camera (Pancam) took the images during the interval Jan. 3, 2014, to Jan. 6, 2014

'The idea we had for the exhibit was to 
show the beauty of Mars and at the same time tell the story of the 
mission and the discoveries,' John Grant, a Smithsonian supervisory geologist, told Slate.

Fifty images will make up the Spirit & Opportunity: 10 Years Roving Across Mars exhibit, which can be seen at the Smithsonian until September 14.

The images sent back on the missions, to two distinct parts of the planet, showed a mix of gorgeous landscapes and desolate scenes that helped scientists learn more about the history of the planet.

'We know that Mars was a very different 
place in its early history. There's evidence it was a much warmer and 
wetter environment,' Mr Grant said.

'That's not to say there was life 
there, but it says conditions might have been conducive to it.'Â
