These dramatic pictures show the desperate attempts of Tanzanian civilians fighting desperately to stay afloat after an overloaded ferry sank of the tourist island of Zanzibar.

At least 190 people died yesterday, whilst more than 600 survivors were rescued in an operation that has left 40 people in a 'serious condition'

The MV Spice Islander was believed to be carrying up to 800 passengers as well as heavy cargo, which may have caused it to sink.

The state of Zanzibar has now begun three days of mourning for the victims of the fatal crash with the Tanzanian government calling for an immediate investigation to uncover the reasons for the disaster.

'The ship's manifest shows that the vessel travelling from Unguja to Pemba islands had more than 500 passengers on board,' Zanzibar Police Commissioner Mussa Alli Mussa said.

'Some 260 passengers have so far been rescued ... we have recovered several bodies but I can't give you the exact death toll at the moment because the situation is very volatile,' he said.

Passengers described the terrifying 
moment when they realized something had gone wrong. People began to 
scream as the boat tilted to one side and water rushed in.

"I realized something strange on the movement of the ship. It was like 
zigzag or dizziness," said 15-year-old Yahya Hussein, who survived by 
clinging to a plank of wood with three others.

"After I noticed that I 
jumped to the rear side of ship and few minutes later the ship went 
lopsided."

Hussein said there had been many children aboard the ship. After the 
ship began to list, water rushed through the main cabin and stopped the 
engines, said Mwita Massoud, another survivor.

Those lucky enough to find something to cling to floated in
the dark waters for at least three hours until the strong currents began to
wash them up on the white sandy shores of Zanzibar.

Throughout the day, police waded through the clear waters to
shore, carrying bodies on stretchers, wrapped in brightly colored cloth and
blankets.

The smallest bundles - the children - they carried in their arms.
Tourists on the popular island helped survivors and local charities provided
blankets and tea.

Pemba is about 25 miles from Zanzibar.
Passengers who regularly take ferries between the two islands said the 
vessels are in a poor state of repair and are often overcrowded and 
loaded with cargo.

'They normally pack us in like 
sardines in a can. And for that I really fear this could be a very big 
disaster,' said resident Mwnakhamis Juma. 

The
government in Zanzibar said last month it planned to invest in bigger, 
more reliable vessels to ferry passengers between the two 
islands.           

'We 
are fearing the greatest calamity in the history of Zanzibar. This is a 
disaster,' said a government official, who declined to be named.

In 2006, another ship capsized in Zanzibar, killing hundreds. But the angry residents of Stone Town who spoke to the AP said the government still did not invest in better ferries or boats capable of mounting a rescue.

Britain's Minister for Africa Henry Bellingham extended his 'deepest sympathy' on behalf of the British government to those affected.

'I was deeply saddened by news of the ferry disaster off Tanzania earlier today which claimed the lives of so many people,' he said in a statement.

'At this difficult time, our thoughts are with the people of Tanzania as they come to terms with this terrible tragedy.'
