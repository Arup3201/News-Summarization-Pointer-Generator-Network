The heartbroken family of a toddler found dead at his home have paid tribute to the 'happy-go-lucky' boy with a 'cheeky smile'.

Liam Fee was discovered after emergency services were called to a flat he shared with his mother and her partner in Thornton, Fife on Saturday evening.

As pictures of the tragic two-year-old were released today, police said they are continuing their investigation into his death, which is being treated as unexplained.

Liam Fee, who was found dead at his home in Fife on Saturday, was described by relatives as 'happy-go-lucky'

Grieving relatives of the two-year-old told of their 'devastation' at their loss.

In a statement released through police, his family said: 'Liam was a happy-go-lucky little boy, with blonde hair, big blue eyes and a cheeky smile.

'He was very much loved by his family and will be deeply missed. Liam had his whole life ahead of him and we are devastated at our loss.

'We would like to thank our friends for their continued support and for all the teddies and flowers left as a tribute to Liam outside the family home, which has provided us with some comfort.

'We request privacy and time to grieve at this very sad and difficult time.'

Liam lived with his mother Rachael Fee, her partner Nyomi Fee and his seven-year-old twin brothers, JJ and Matthew, in the three-bedroom flat.

Police were called after a neighbour heard a woman’s screams coming from the flat.

Officers say they are not looking for anyone else in connection with the death.

A local resident, who did not want to be named, said: ‘I heard a woman’s crying coming from the flat. She sounded hysterical. Then the police arrived.’

Friend Gillian McCusker, 35, said the family seemed happy on the afternoon before the incident.

She added: ‘He seemed perfectly fine. They all seemed OK. The twins said hello and Liam smiled at my son. It’s horrible to think that was the last time he’d be seen alive. It is such a tragedy.’

Forensic experts spent hours at the 
property on Saturday night, while floral tributes and soft toys were 
left on the grass outside.

Liam's mother and her partner are believed to have both come from Tyneside and struck up a relationship after Rachael split up with the father of her three sons.

They moved to Scotland about two years ago and took part in a civil ceremony a year ago.

Rachael changed her name from Telfer to take Nyomi’s surname. The boys also began using the name Fee.

The boys’ father, Joseph Johnson, is believed to still live in Ryton,Tyneside.

Friends of the women said that Liam suffered from autism and his brother JJ had to use a wheelchair after being diagnosed with an infection in his lower leg.

But the two women often held parties at their rented flat, where they also kept snakes, dogs and several pet rats.
