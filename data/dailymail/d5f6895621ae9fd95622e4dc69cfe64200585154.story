A boy of 11 was dug out of a sandpit 20 minutes after it collapsed on him in what his family have called a ‘miracle’ rescue.

Nicholas Nelson said ‘goodbye’ to everyone he knew in his head as the pile of sand covered his whole body, trapping him 1ft under the surface with a tiny air pocket that kept him alive.

His brother Kyle Rininger, 16, ran for help but he and their mother Aimee were unable to find him in the dunes.

Trapped: Nicholas Nelson said 'goodbye' to everyone he knew in his head as the pile of sand covered his whole body

Some 100 friends and neighbours and emergency crews joined in the search and after 20 agonising minutes they pulled Nicholas free.

He was taken to hospital and has now made a full recovery.

Incredibly the incident was not the first time that Kyle has saved Nicholas’ life - two years ago he fell through some ice and his brother was there too.

Nicholas’ latest brush with death came on Sunday afternoon as they both played in the sand near their home in Saranac, Michigan, against the advice of their mother.

In interviews with Mlive.com, wzzm13 and woodtv, Nicholas said that the sand ‘just kept falling and falling’ on top of him.

Lost: The family frantically searched for Nicholas but were unable to find him in the dunes, pictured, because he was completely covered by sand

He said: ‘I could move an inch but every time I went down, a lot (of sand) would come down on me and just kept squishing me.

‘After like a minute I passed out but I was lucky there was a gap by me - it was really scary.

‘It all collapsed on me, and I started yelling and he (Kyle) started digging.

‘And then he stopped 'cause he knew he wouldn't be able to get there in time, so he ran for help.

‘I didn't think I was gonna make it, so I started saying 'bye to people, and then I passed out.

Close-call: Kyle burst into his nearby home, pictured, and told his mother and her boyfriend 'get a shovel' and they all jumped into her truck and drove to help

‘Luckily, I had a little gap though to breath, or else I would've been gone.’

Kyle burst into his home and told his mother and her boyfriend ‘get a shovel’ and they all jumped into her truck and drove to help.

But when they got to the spot they thought Nicholas was, they were unable to find him because the sand had so completely collapsed on top of him.

Around 100 friends and locals joined in the search along with emergency responders and an ambulance helicopter - and after 20 minutes Nicholas was found.

Miracle: Mother Aimee Nelson said that God must have played a part in keeping her son Nicholas alive

He was pulled from the sand conscious and still breathing, but badly shaken up.

The family have now said that God must have played a part in keeping Nicholas alive.

Aimee Nelson said: ‘It's a miracle that he's here. I'm very happy he's home - he's in one piece - there's nothing wrong with him, it's a miracle.

‘Kyle's quick thinking - when he realized he couldn't help and he came up here and got myself and my boyfriend - his quick thinking saved Nicholas’.

Nicholas added: ‘I think someone was down there with me to create the gap, and make sure I didn't go.’
