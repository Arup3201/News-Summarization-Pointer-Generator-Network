The two characters that have set the Formula One season alight are ideally drawn for dramatic effect: Englishman Lewis Hamilton, the fastest driver of his generation yet emotionally vulnerable, against the German Nico Rosberg, only a fraction slower but ice cool in his calculation.

The stewards cleared Rosberg of deliberately thwarting Hamilton’s final qualifying lap at the Monaco Grand Prix by running off the track at Mirabeau corner. Rosberg started from pole, won the race and took the championship lead off Hamilton.

But if Rosberg did know what he was doing — as many, though not all, paddock observers believe — it was a crime perpetrated with so much forethought and so immaculately executed that it is hard not to equate Rosberg to the sort of villain who strokes a white cat on his lap.

Frosty: Lewis Hamilton and Nico Rosberg's relations were strained at a controversial Monaco Grand Prix

His answers to the press, and 
seemingly to the stewards, were more coolly convincing than Michael 
Schumacher’s in similar circumstances, when he ‘parked’ on the racing 
line in qualifying eight years ago to block Fernando Alonso’s crack at 
pole. Rosberg’s father, Keke, who was world champion in 1982, famously 
called Schumacher ‘a cheap cheat’ for his skulduggery.

Even
 more impressively, Rosberg refused to be ruffled by Hamilton’s 
simmering anger at press conferences after qualifying and after the 
race. He said calmly that he and Hamilton are friends; Hamilton said 
emphatically they weren’t.

It may have irked Hamilton that his insinuations were met with serene indifference. Fire, in this instance, could not melt ice.

They
 managed not to speak on the night of the race. Rosberg and his fiancee,
 Vivian, left the gala dinner on Sunday to arrive at the Amber Lounge at
 1.15am to party with about 20 friends and 15 mechanics. They were 
briefly joined by Bayern Munich footballer David Alaba and ended the 
celebrations at breakfast time on the terrace at Le Meridien.

Hamilton was also at the Amber Lounge, but his table was a diplomatically long way from Rosberg’s.

Contract: Rosberg leapfrogged Hamilton to the top of the standings after his win in Monaco

Rosberg
 clearly has a steeliness that belies the coiffured blond locks that won
 him the nickname Britney, as in Spears, from his fellow drivers. His 
manner with those of us he deals with on a professional basis is cordial
 but not matey. He is self-assured and self-possessed.

Interviewing
 him earlier in the season in the back of his Mercedes, I was twiddling 
with a pen and it snapped in my hand. He said: ‘Are you nervous?’ It 
seemed a typical Rosberg comment, a half-joke but one with a point.

On
 that Thursday, the first of the four-day grand prix weekend, he arrived
 early at the track. His driver parked up in an empty car park and 
Rosberg started work with his engineers, knowing his cerebral approach —
 he turned down a place to study engineering at Imperial College — 
offers the best, possibly the only, way to beat Hamilton to the title.

Feud: Hamilton was unhappy at the way Rosberg achieved his pole position on Saturday

Mercedes
 chairman Niki Lauda admitted as much, seeing in  Rosberg’s attention to
 detail something of his own approach. Hamilton he described as quicker 
and more naturally gifted.

Ah,
 Hamilton. He is brilliant yet brittle. That is the view of a former 
karting rival of Hamilton and Rosberg, Dutchman Giedo van der Garde, 
formerly of Caterham but now a test driver at Sauber. He has placed a 
bet on Rosberg winning the title on the basis the German has the mental 
fortitude that Hamilton lacks.

Bernie Ecclestone, possibly the best judge of a driver, said at the start of the season that he thought Rosberg would prevail.

But
 Hamilton’s former McLaren team-mate, Jenson Button, has backed his 
fellow Briton to recover for the next race in Montreal a week on Sunday.
 Speaking from experience, he said: ‘Lewis would arrive at the next race
 after an upset very quiet, then go out and blitz it. He will do the 
same in  Canada — he will probably be untouchable in Canada.’

Upset: During an interview after the race, Hamilton said he and Nico are not friends

An
 important factor in deciding who wins the title is how Hamilton will 
fare without his father Anthony’s daily presence. He has not won a title
 at any level without him as his manager. He was the one person who 
would fight for his son against the world.

In
 Anthony’s absence, Mercedes must make Lewis feel loved if he is to 
perform at his best. That is not easy because when they put their two 
drivers on different strategies, and Hamilton perceives Rosberg’s is the
 better one, his frustrations — paranoia even — could devour him.

The
 other control Anthony had over his son was in ensuring he was not 
distracted by off-track glamour: rappers, life in LA, the red carpet. 
Perhaps those factors have provided balance to Hamilton’s life, made him
 more rounded and worldly, but there remains the possibility that he 
could be drawn too often to those sirens.

Much,
 therefore, falls on Lauda, whose words after the race were refreshing. 
He knows he cannot stop his drivers feuding — there is too much at stake
 for that — but he can draw a line which they must not cross. He has 
said they must be just about civil towards each other and not drive each
 other off the track.

Thirsty work: The Brit has won four of the six races this season, but still trails Rosberg in the drivers' standings

Flashback: Hamilton and Rosberg together during their younger days

This 
rivalry is precisely what  Formula One needed. Suddenly it makes no odds
 that Mercedes are so far ahead because the championship fight is 
perfectly distilled into a mano a mano fight, with two-thirds of the 
season to go.

One regret: the BBC did not show the Monaco Grand Prix live, a deprivation for the casual,  non-Sky audience.

Sky
 show all races live, the BBC then pick the three races they most want 
to show live. They selected the British Grand Prix, the Canadian Grand 
Prix — because it is at peak viewing time — and the last race, Abu 
Dhabi, as it could be the title-decider.

Sky
 then choose three races that they do not want the BBC to get their 
hands on. Monaco, along with the other potential deciders, Brazil and 
the United States, were on that list.

It is a shame because we have a 21st century answer to the Senna-Prost rivalry unfolding before us.

FERNANDO ALONSO  v LEWIS HAMILTON 

Alonso, the champion, demanded No 1 status over Hamilton at McLaren in 2007. It was denied him.

NELSON PIQUET  v NIGEL MANSELL 

Piquet called his 1986 and 1987 Williams team-mate ‘an uneducated blockhead with a stupid and ugly wife’.

ALAIN PROST v AYRTON SENNA 

The two star drivers regularly collided on the track. Prost said they made up before Senna died.

NIKI LAUDA v JAMES HUNT 

Lauda was given the last rites after a crash in Monza; he came back but lost the 1976 title in the final race.

STIRLING MOSS v MIKE HAWTHORN 

The sporting rivalry. Moss campaigned not to have Hawthorn disqualified in Portugal and lost the title to him by a point.
