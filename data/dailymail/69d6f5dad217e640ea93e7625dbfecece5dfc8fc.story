The interrogation technique involved 'stern comments delivered at high volume and at close quarters as a verbal, short, sharp shock'

An Iraqi man is suing the Ministry of Defence, saying it should ban soldiers from shouting or making ‘stern comments’ to detainees.

Haidar Ali Hussein wants an interrogation method called ‘direct challenge’, used in war zones, to be outlawed.

The former detainee’s case has been given the go ahead even though he admits he was never questioned using the technique.

So far, it is thought to have cost taxpayers tens of thousands of pounds, and the bill is still rising.

Direct challenge, which can be used on captured civilians, is no longer in use in Iraq, where Mr Ali Hussein is from, and is rarely used in Afghanistan.

It allows trained questioners to shout in a detainee’s face and make ‘stern comments’.

The MoD restricted use of the method in the wake of an inquiry into the treatment of Baha Mousa, an Iraqi civilian who died with multiple injuries in British custody in 2003.

Questioners are banned from shouting in a person’s ear and must only do it to their face, and must not threaten violence. But Mr Ali Hussein claims it still breaches international law.

His case was initially dismissed by the High Court in February, when a judge criticised it as ‘misconceived’.

Lady Justice Hallett said she had ‘very real doubts as to the propriety of spending precious time and resources on this litigation’.

She told the court the technique was ‘strictly controlled and limited’ by new rules. She said: ‘Shouting at someone, with nothing more, is not an assault. It does not amount to coercion or oppression and it is not threatening or abusive.’

But this week the Court of Appeal gave permission for the case to continue, saying it raised issues that ‘deserved to be considered’.

Despite amendments made to MoD policy in the wake of the Baha Mousa (pictured) Inquiry - a probe into the 2003 death of an Iraqi civilian in British military custody - the 'Direct Challenge' method has not been banned

Tim Owen QC and Danny Friedman QC, for Mr Ali Hussein, said direct challenge involved ‘stern comments delivered at high volume and at close quarters as a verbal, short, sharp shock’.

Mr Owen said it was ‘plainly coercive and deliberately so’ and breached international law, including Article 3 of the Geneva Convention.

Sam Wordsworth QC, for the MoD, insisted it is lawful and pointed out that it has only been authorised six times since October last year.

Mr Ali Hussein claims he suffered even harsher physical and mental abuse after his arrest by British forces in Iraq in 2004, but accepts he was not affected by direct challenge.

Lord Justice Lloyd Jones, sitting with Lord Justice Moore-Bick, gave him permission to appeal, saying: ‘I have real concerns as to whether Mr Ali Hussein has standing to bring these proceedings.

‘However, I do consider that these proceedings give rise to issues which deserve to be considered by the full court. In saying this, I should not be taken to express the view that these are strong grounds of appeal.

‘In so far as I grant permission to appeal, I direct that the issue of standing is determined by full court at the same hearing.’

An MoD spokesman said: ‘We are disappointed that permission has been granted by the Court of Appeal. We are satisfied that the challenging approach is lawful and is subject to strict controls and safeguards.’
