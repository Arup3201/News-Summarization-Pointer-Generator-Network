It is the battle for your face.

Facebook and Google have been involved in an algorithm war to come up with the perfect facial detection system.

Now Google has claimed the latest victory, saying its new FaceNet system is practically perfect - getting the right person 99.96% of the time.

Google researchers call their system the most-accurate technology available for recognizing human faces.

In the paper, titled 'FaceNet: A Unified Embedding for Face Recognition and Clustering', Google claims the system achieved nearly 100-percent accuracy rate on the facial recognition dataset Labeled Faces in the Wild.

The dataset uses more than 13,000 face images from the Internet to measure how accurate the algorithms are at verifying whether two images are of the same individual

'Our method uses a deep convolutional network trained to directly optimize the embedding itself, rather than an intermediate bottleneck layer as in previous deep learning approaches,' the researchers say.

'To train, we use triplets of roughly aligned matching / non-matching face patches generated using a novel online triplet mining method. 

'The benefit of our approach is much greater representational efficiency: we achieve state-of-the-art face recognition performance using only 128-bytes per face.

'On the widely used Labeled Faces in the Wild (LFW) dataset, our system achieves a new record accuracy of 99.63%. 

'On YouTube Faces DB it achieves 95.12%. Our system cuts the error rate in comparison to the best published result by 30% on both datasets.

FaceNet was trained on an enormous 260-million-image dataset and performed at an 86 percent and higher accuracy rate.

Last year, a team of Chinese researchers claimed to have achieved better than 99 percent accuracy. 

In the June 2014 paper, Facebook researchers said that humans analyzing images in the Labeled Faces dataset are only able to achieve 97.5 percent accuracy.

However, Google researchers went beyond simply verifying whether two faces are identical by also attaching a name to a face.

Google's system first clusters photos into a collection of similar faces

Taking a classic facial recognition approach, the researchers went as far as organizing the images into groups of faces that look the most similar or the most distinct.

 When Google's FaceNet and Facebook's 'DeepFace' are eventually integrated into their company's web platforms, it is believed they will automate the process of tagging photos and searching for people and will also make it easier for web companies to analyze their users' social networks and to assess global trends.

FaceNet was trained on an enormous 260-million-image dataset and performed at an 86 percent and higher accuracy rate. These were the only images it did NOT get right.

Facebook's technology - called DeepFace - was first showcased last March, but the site has now started rolling out the automatic tagging tool to select users.  

DeepFace uses technology designed by an Israeli startup called face.com. 

Facebook bought the startup in 2013 and developed the facial recognition tool with support from face.com's Yaniv Taigman at its Artificial Intelligence lab. 

The researchers used the software to build a 3D model of a face from a photo that can be rotated into the best position for an algorithm to begin searching for a match. 

After creating a model, the team used a neural network that had been trained on a database of faces to try and match the face with one in a test database of more than 4 million images, containing more than 4,000 separate identities, each one labelled by humans. 

Its creators said DeepFace finds a match with 97.25 per cent accuracy.

The tagging option has now started appearing in the privacy settings of accounts globally - although in many cases it says the feature is 'unavailable' -  but a number of users have reportedly been given the tool.

Taylor Hatmaker at The Daily Dot, for example, said that she recently tested the feature using an album of 15 photos.

None of the images had been shared previously, and Facebook identified and automatically tagged faces in eight of the photos.

Only one tag was incorrect, and the images it didn't offer suggestions for were 'taken in dark rooms' or were blurry.

A test using real people recruited on Amazon's Mechanical Turk crowdsourcing site achieved 97.5 per cent accuracy.

Security researcher Lee Munson said: 'The social network plans to use the system to identify its users in new photos as they are uploaded.

Tagging photos in this way is restricted in the EU following a report by Ireland's Data Protection Authority (DPA) that advised removing it in 2012. 

This means it is not available in Europe.  

Elsewhere, people who do have the feature but want to disable it can go to their Facebook Settings menu and open the Privacy menu. 

Under 'How can I manage tags people add and tagging suggestions there will be an option labelled Who sees tag suggestions when photos that look like you are uploaded?', change the option to 'No One.' 

Facebook said it does not have an official comment about the technology or rollout plans.
