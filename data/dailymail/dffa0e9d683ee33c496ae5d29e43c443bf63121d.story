ASBO: Robert Thomas, 59, kept his neighbours awake by playing Radio 4 at full volume

A man 'plagued the lives' of his neighbours' by playing BBC Radio 4 at maximum volume in the early hours of the morning, a court heard.

Robert Thomas, 59, subjected the family next door to World Service news reports, documentaries and other music stations throughout the night.

Stewart and Juliet Dunlop and their two teenage children were forced to wear earplugs to try and get some sleep.

But when they complained Thomas began a 'sustained campaign of anti-social behaviour' - including vandalism and spraying them with a garden hose.

The situation got so bad the family were eventually forced to move out of their semi-detached home next door to the defendant in the Hanham area of Bristol.

Thomas had already been given an ASBO for his behaviour which he admitted breaching on four occasions between September and October 2011.

He was handed a six month community order with six months supervision at Bristol Crown Court.

Recorder Oba Nsugbe QC told him: 'There is no doubt you played music at times which were inappropriate and in a manner bound to cause disruption and upset.

'An ASBO is serious and you breached it which is obviously a serious matter.'

The court was told Thomas became increasingly aggressive towards the family and at one point threw a garden ornament through their car window.

On another occasion Thomas sat on the bonnet of Mrs Dunlop's car and stopped her from exiting her driveway.

Thomas had already been sentenced to an interim ASBO meaning he must not cause anyone, including the Dunlops, harassment, alarm or distress.

But while the interim ASBO was in place Thomas breached it on four occasions by playing loud music in anti social hours.

Mr Reid continued: 'On September 14 the Dunlops were awoken by loud music at 5.15am. Through experience they were able to ignore it and put earplugs in.

'The same happened on September 16 and 17 when Mr and Mrs Dunlop were again awoken by loud music coming from the defendant's house.

Anti-social behaviour: Thomas, 59, who lives in the house on the left, played Radio 4 so loud it kept his neighbours awake. They eventually moved out of their home

'It was not just continuously loud music - it was being turned on and off - which is particularly irritating. It was loud, intrusive and completely inappropriate.

'On October 7 music was again heard and it was monitored by Environmental Health equipment. It was not just music but radio played loud and knocking against the wall.'

The court heard Thomas had previous matters for anti-social behaviour including a caution for his behaviour towards the Dunlops.

Oliver Wilmott, defending, said his client had a delusional disorder. An appeal against the imposition of the ASBO will be heard at a later date.
