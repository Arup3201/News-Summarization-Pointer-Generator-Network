Two new moons have been discovered orbiting Jupiter, bringing the planet's total number of known satellites to 67.

And, at just two kilometres in diameter, one of the moons may be Jupiter's smallest known satellite.

The two distant moons - S/2010 J 1 and S/2010 J 2 - were discovered during routine tracking observations of already known satellites in September 2010.

They were then re-observed by scientists several times that autumn.

With Jupiter now having 67 known satellites, the discovery of two tiny moons does not have a large bearing on our understanding of the system.

Their size has been estimated based on their brightness.

S/2010 J 1 is 3km in 
diametre, while S/2010 J 1 is estimated to be just 2km in diameter.

It
 is believed that nearly all moons the size of S/2010 J 1 or larger are 
known.

But as there are always a lot more small moons than large 
moons, there must be dozens of satellites in the 1-3 km class.

The researchers, whose study is published in Astronomical Journal, claim their finds confirm this.

And as S/2010 J 2 is the faintest, and thus smallest, Jovian satellite discovered to date, its discovery confirms that the planet's satellite population does continue down to those sizes.

Researcher Mike Alexandersen, from the University of British Columbia, said: 'It
 was exciting to realise that S/2010 J 2 is the smallest moon in 
the Solar System that was discovered and tracked from Earth..

S/2010 J 1 orbits with an average distance from Jupiter of 
23.5million kilometres and has an orbital period of 2.02 years.

S/2010 J 2 
has a semi-major axis of 21million kilometres and an orbital period 
of 1.69 years.

The 
irregular satellites of the giant planets are clustered in 'families' 
with similar orbits and colours.

These families are believed to have 
formed as a result of ancient collisions of passing-by comets or 
asteroids with former larger moons.

S/2010 J 1 was discovered on images taken by the Palomar 200-inch Hale Telescope by an international team led by Nasa Jet Propulsion Laboratory astronomers Robert Jacobson and Marina Brozovic, and University of British Columbia astronomy professor Brett Gladman and PhD student Mr Alexandersen.

S/2010 J 2 was spotted on images taken with the MegaCam mosaic CCD camera at the 3.6m Canada-France-Hawaii telescope by CFHT executive director and director Christian Veillet.

Upon later inspection, S/2010 J 2 was also weakly visible in the images taken just days earlier by Palomar.
