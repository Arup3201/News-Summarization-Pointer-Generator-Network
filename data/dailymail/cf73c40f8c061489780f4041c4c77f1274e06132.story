He’s old enough to be her grandfather and spent almost a decade in federal prison for bribery and extortion.

But that didn’t put Trina Grimes Scott, 32, off former Louisiana governor Edwin Edwards, 83, as  she married him Friday morning.

The four-term Democrat told a crowd in the lobby of the Monteleone Hotel in New Orleans' historic French Quarter that they had married in a simple private ceremony.

A kiss for the bride! Edwin Edwards plants a wet one on the cheek of his new bride, 51 years his junior

Grimes, clutching a bridal bouquet, 
stood next to her new husband while he did most of the talking to 
reporters and admirers in the hotel lobby.

Mr
Edwards, who turns 84 next month, attended his first public event a couple weeks ago after 
completing his jail sentence, and introduced the beautiful blonde as his
fiancée.

He was befriended by Miss Scott during 
an eight-year prison sentence followed by six months in home 
confinement, which he finished this earlier month.

The newlyweds took a stroll down bourbon street after the private ceremony. Edwards will have a lot celebrate when turns 84 next month

They became engaged despite the 51-year age gap, but he said at the awards dinner this week: ‘A man is only as old as the woman he feels.’

Mr Edwards is a twice-divorced great-grandfather who served 16 years as Louisiana governor and has been with Miss Scott for around a year.

They first stepped out at the Foundation for Historical Louisiana awards dinner in Baton Rouge, Louisiana.

his sentence with his beautiful blonde then fiancé Miss Scott

He was married to first wife Elaine for 40 years before a 1989 divorce and later married Candy in 1994 before they divorced when he was in jail in 2004.

Miss Scott wrote on Facebook that her new fiancé is ‘such a pleasure to take care of’, reported The Times-Picayune last month.

The disgraced ex-governor was sentenced for bribery and extortion related to the award of state casino gambling licenses.

‘I really feel like I came out of prison more popular than I went in,’ he said.

Not so happy: Mr Edwards arrives at the Ecumenical House, a halfway house, to begin serving the remainder of his sentence in January 2011

‘I think in some part because people realise that an injustice occurred and that I handled it like a man. I took it. I survived.

'I said that I would walk out, and I did.’

Shaun Sanghani, a TV producer who is in discussions with Edwards about starting a new reality show, was him earlier this month.

‘I've never seen a reality show, but I hear about them,’ Mr Edwards said.

‘I want to assure everyone that if we have one there will be nothing in it that's embarrassing to my state or to me or my family.’
