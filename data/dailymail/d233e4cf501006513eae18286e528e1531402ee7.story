A couple branded the 'middle class squatters' have been found guilty of an attempted £3.5million fraud, just four years after their last conviction.

Richard Jerome, 66, and wife Hazel, 62, posed as as wealthy expatriates and made several fake cash offers on exclusive properties in an attempt to allow them to move in before the sale went through.

The couple, from Towcester, Northamptonshire, were convicted for a similar stunt in Cambridgeshire in 2009, and changed their names so as not to be caught out as they moved their scam to Devon.

Con artists: Richard and Hazel Jerome, who were convicted of fraud in 2009 after posing as a rich couple looking for a new home so they could find empty properties to squat in, are accused of carrying out the same scam in a different part of Britain

In a carbon copy case of their 2009 scam, the pair - described to the court as 'habitual confidence tricksters' - would squat at the vacant houses until they were evicted by force.

During a trial at Exeter Crown Court jurors heard that Jerome embarked on his latest scam just days after he was released from jail for a similar con.

Posing as an international financier working with Unesco, he told estate agents and property owners he and his wife had just returned from Caribbean tax exile and wanted to resettle in the UK.

In reality, she was a retired teacher and he was a former minicab driver with less than £200 in his bank account.

In 2009, the Jeromes duped two couples into allowing them to live in their Milton Keyne's properties without charge for 18 months.

After making cash offers, the couple made up different lies top they explained delays in the house purchase - and ask to rent in the interim but never handed over any money.

Mr Jerome was jailed 15 months after he admitted fraud and deception, and his wife was 
given a 10-month suspended term after she too admitted fraud.

After Mr Jerome's release from jail the couple gave false names so media reports about their earlier scam would not show up in searches.

But they were rumbled after a surveyor chased them for payment and uncovered their real identities.

Both denied eight counts of fraud by making false representations as to their available funds.

Target: The couple have also previously been convicted of squatting for six months in this cottage in Stoke Hammond, Buckinghamshire

But a jury found the pair guilty of fraud and Jerome was remanded in custody by Judge Erik Salomonsen, who branded him a 'menace'.

He said: 'You know the score. You are a confidence trickster. You are a menace.

'You were a menace when you were convicted before and you continue to be a menace.'

Jerome's wife was bailed but warned that she too may face jail when the couple, from Towcester, Northamptonshire, are sentenced next month.

The pair made offers on properties in Looe in Cornwall, Sidmouth in Devon and Daventry, Northamptonshire, between 2009 and 2011.
