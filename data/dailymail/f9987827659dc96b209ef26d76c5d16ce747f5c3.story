Two teenage boys have been arrested on suspicion of murdering an 18-year-old man in a daylight attack. 

Aqeel Khan was found with suspected stab wounds in Watford, Hertfordshire, yesterday afternoon.

Two of the suspects, aged 15 and 16, were detained overnight on suspicion of murder while a 21-year-old man was also arrested in connection with the incident yesterday afternoon.

All three men from Watford remain in police custody.

Mr Khan was found in Croxley View at around 4.20pm and was taken to Watford General Hospital, but died a short time later.

Detective Inspector Jon McAdam from the Bedfordshire, Cambridgeshire and Hertfordshire Major Crime Unit said: 'Our investigations into this incident are continuing and further arrests have now been made.
