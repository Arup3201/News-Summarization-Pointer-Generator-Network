It is a sexual quixotic quest that has 
frustrated couples for decades.

The illusive G-Spot has proved an enduring mystery - sparking debate among doctors, some of whom claim the idea of the G-Spot is a myth.

But now, for those who can locate their G-Sport, help is at hand as it is revealed that the sex lives of couples worldwide could be enhanced dramatically thanks to a single jab.

The vaginal sub mocosal hylauronic acid injection - or G-Shot - claims to improve women's sex lives by pumping filler into their G-Spot.

And now an Essex clinic reports a 50 per cent boom in bookings for the surgical procedure, suggesting it really works.

The jab, which costs £550, temporarily increases the G-Spot's size to that of a 10p coin.

Dr Lucy Glancey, of Grancey Medical in Essex. has been performing this operation for five years.

In the first three years she performed approximately 60 procedures and in the last two years she has seen a 50 per cent increase, with approximately 90 cases completed.

The G-Shot has an expected longevity of six months.

Dr Glancey said she gets inquiries from younger women who do not need the procedure and see it as a fashion trend, but she doesn't perform the procedure on them, deeming it 'unnecessary'.

Her usual clientele, who do benefit from the jab, include women in the 35-50 age group who have either given birth, changed with age or have embarked on a new relationship, perhaps with a younger man.

Dr Grancey says women with 'stretching 
and age-related changes experience less tightness and friction' and the 
G-Shot can help with this to a degree.

The G-Shot involves locating 
the position of the G-Spot and enlarging the area using a dermal filler.

A
speculum - like the ones used during a cervical smear test - is gently inserted into the vagina to access the G-Spot.

A hyaluronic acid dermal 
filler is then injected into the vaginal wall.

The dermal filler 
contains a local anesthetic to keep discomfort to a 
minimum.

But the clinic also warns patients of the possible risks associated with the procedure. These include infection, urinary retention, painful intercourse, a 'sensation of always being sexually aroused' - or no effect at all.

Along with all those risks, though, comes the hope of increased frequency and intensity of orgasm, especially for those who have not experienced vaginal orgasm before.

The 'lunchtime' procedure can be completed in just half an hour.

It
is certainly proving a hit in Los Angeles where women are rushing to 
the Vaginal Rejuvenation Institute of America for their fix.

Now, as the procedure becomes increasingly more widespread in the UK, women will not have to fly so far afield to get the boost they have always wanted.

Yes, yes, yes! Some women report the G-Spot leads to powerful orgasms

The GräfenberG-Spot, often called the G-Spot, is defined as a bean-shaped area of the vagina.

Some women report that it is an erogenous zone which, when stimulated, can lead to strong sexual arousal, powerful orgasms and female ejaculation. 

The G-Spot is typically described as being located one to three inches (2.5 to 7.6 cm) up the front (anterior) vaginal wall between the vaginal opening and the urethra and is a sensitive area that may be part of the female prostate.

Although the G-Spot has been studied since the 1940s, disagreement persists over its existence as a distinct structure, definition and location.

A 2009 British study concluded that its existence is unproven and subjective, based on questionnaires and personal experience.

Other studies, using ultrasound, have found physiological evidence of the G-Spot in women who report having orgasms during intercourse.

It is also hypothesised that the G-Spot is an extension of the clitoris and that this is the cause of vaginal orgasms. 

Sexologists and other researchers are concerned that women may consider themselves to be dysfunctional if they do not experience the G-Spot, and emphasise that it is normal not to experience it.
