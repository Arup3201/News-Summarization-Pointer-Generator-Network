Enough is enough: Angela Merkel is reported to be 'losing her patience' with the UK over Europe

German leader Angela Merkel is reported to be 'losing her patience' with the UK over Europe as an EU commissioner challenges London to decide whether or not it wants to remain in the bloc.

Respected German news magazine Der Spiegel also said on Friday that Brussels is reaching the end of its tether over British attitudes to the union as the budget squabbling which threatens to split prime minister David Cameron's conservatives once more brings the UK role in the club under the spotlight.

Britain is adamant in its refusal to accept the budget proposal of €1 trillion (£800million) made by the European Commission and has demanded that it be slashed by up to 20 percent.

On Friday, European Commissioner for financial programming and budget Janusz Lewandowski, Poland's representative in the EU's executive, said it was time for Britain to make a 'fundamental decision' regarding its future in the European Union.

'Of course there are limits,' he said in an interview with the German daily Süddeutsche Zeitung. 'We can't finance more Europe with substantially less money.'

When asked if he was referring to budgetary criticism coming from London, Lewandowski said: 'Of course I am also referring to Great Britain. Either they see their future in the European Union in the long term or they don't.

'You should not forget that in the course of recent years, leaders have handed the EU new obligations. Unfortunately it is often the case that the financial aspect is forgotten.'

Tough talk: EU Commissioner Janusz Lewandowski, left, said it was time for Britain to make a 'fundamental decision' while David Cameron, right, said Britain was 'taking the toughest line of all in the budget negotiations'

'This government is taking the toughest line in these budget negotiations of any government since we joined the European Union,' Cameron said. 'At best we would like it cut, at worst frozen, and I'm quite prepared to use the veto if we don't get a deal that's good for Britain.'

Lewandowski is not the only one losing his patience with the tone of the debate. Several European leaders have waded into the budget debate in recent days and some have used language similar in its firmness to that coming out of London.

German Chancellor Angela Merkel on 
Thursday asked for all sides to calm down. 'I don't want to throw more 
vetoes into the room,' she said at a press conference. 'It doesn't help 
bring about a solution.'

But she too is said to be on a collision course with Cameron.

Chancellery
sources say that when she visits him in London next week she will ask 
him straight out; do you want to be part of the continent or not?

'She is a scientist and a patient woman,' said a close aide. 'But her patience with the UK is wearing very, very thin.....'

Not snookered yet: Despite the pressure, David Cameron did find time for a spot of snooker during a visit to Twenty Twenty at the Schofield Centre in Loughborough, Leicestershire, today
