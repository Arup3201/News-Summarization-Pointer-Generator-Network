In the latest instalment of his weekly column, Chief Sports Writer Martin Samuel gives his verdict on the footballing issues of the week, saying what made him feel warm inside and what made him shiver...

WHAT'S HOT

The Championship 

Specifically, the top four going into this weekend: Derby County, Ipswich Town, Brentford and Bournemouth. What’s not to like? All of those clubs would be an addition to the Premier League – but each for very different reasons.

Derby County – well, Steve McClaren deserves a break. He did a great job at Twente Enschede in Holland, got Queens Park Rangers off to a good start under Harry Redknapp in the Championship last season, and was desperately unlucky not to come up with Derby in the play-offs in May. Despite that setback he kept the momentum going through the summer and now sits top of the league.

Derby lead the Championship by a point after 19 gruelling games and look a solid shout for promotion

Brentford and Bournemouth – two new names for the Premier League, two traditionally small clubs with loyal followings. Mark Warburton at Brentford probably has the most unconventional background of any manager in the professional leagues, coming from the City of London trading floors, while Eddie Howe at Bournemouth is heading for the top division one way or another. If either club sustained their early form it would be a giant achievement.

Finally, Ipswich. Dumped by Wolverhampton Wanderers, manager Mick McCarthy is again proving his worth with limited resources. Second in the league, total spending £10,000, and that on Tyrone Mings from Chippenham Town. The man’s a genius.

Juju

According to Emmanuel Adebayor of Tottenham Hotspur the explanation for his bad form this season is juju people employed by his family casting black magic spells. And it may be worse than he thought. Juju is probably the only rational explanation for Roberto Soldado’s first Premier League goal since March 2. They conjured Soldado’s winner against Everton just to make poor Emmanuel appear even worse.

Putting your feet up

DFS, the sofa manufacture company, are the new sponsors of Team GB. You may find this ironic – a marriage of sloth and extreme athleticism – until considering some of the British Olympic Association’s other backers. Coca-Cola, McDonalds, Nissan, Panasonic and BP. So now, all in the name of supporting the team, you can fill up with petrol and drive to the local fast food chain, emerging weighed down with burgers and fizzy drinks, before heading off home to veg out on the sofa and wolf the lot down while watching the Olympics on one of the new A400 LEDs. Not forgetting that Team GB are also sponsored by P&G, just in case the whole process makes you sick, requiring Pepto-Bismol.

WHAT'S NOT 

Moaning about Christmas

Louis van Gaal started it. Beginning a run of nine games in 36 days with Manchester United’s 3-0 win over Hull City on Saturday, the Dutchman kicked off an intensive spell of whinging about the number of matches in December. He was quickly followed by fellow countryman Ronald Koeman, who claimed Southampton were worse off than rivals such as Manchester United, because they had the same number of fixtures – but fewer players.

Maybe if they hadn’t sold half the first team that wouldn’t be such a problem. As for Van Gaal, as he is not even fully through his first season in English football, he may wish to consider that we like it like this – and that if he doesn’t, we can all see a way out.

Non-apology apologies

'I apologise if I offended anybody,' said Mario Balotelli. 'If the song offended anybody, I’m sorry,' echoed Football Association of Ireland chief John Delaney. Both delivered non-apology apologies. They’re all the rage now. 'If I offended anybody…' they begin, when the protagonist knows damn well he offended – that’s why he’s apologising. The non-apology apology also makes it appear as if the fault is with the offended for taking offence; the ‘if’ implying that they are many more sane, rational people out there who care not a jot that you sang a song about a terrorist martyr/insulted the Jews/exchanged racist text messages/engaged in sexist banter/committed rape, not all of which can be attributed to Balotelli and Delaney, of course. Nobody says sorry any more; and even when they do, it’s still your fault.

Wes Morgan

It has not been a good week for the captain of Leicester City. He put through his own net against Queens Park Rangers last Saturday, his weak header gifted Liverpool an equaliser on Tuesday, and he was then sent off. Mick McCarthy, during his time playing centre half for Manchester City, went on a similarly bleak run. Asked about his latest blunder, he did not shirk. 'Anyone can have a bad career,' deadpanned Mick.

Championship high-flyers Ipswich,  Brentford and Bournemouth would also be worthy additions to the Premier League
