Parents are using iPads and tablet computers as ‘electronic babysitters’, research revealed yesterday.

The tablet has become the go-to device to occupy youngsters with 91 per cent of families who own one admitting their child uses it, or even has one of their own.

Some 50 per cent admitted that their child uses a tablet every day and 17 per cent confessed that their son or daughter turns it on several times a day.

An Ofcom report looking at how we communicate found that children are using a tablet to watch films, play games and do their homework from the age of five.

But a clinical psychologist yesterday warned relying on such devices put children at risk of developing a string of health problems.

According to the Ofcom survey which questioned 3,700 UK residents, live TV accounted for 90 per cent of all viewing in 2012.

The average viewer enjoys four hours of TV a day and ‘the living room has been transformed into a digital media hub’.

Although 41 per cent of households have cut back to just one television set, an increasing number are choosing to watch programmes on tablets.

One in four households has at least one tablet computer with 56 per cent of them being used to watch TV live, YouTube or catch-up services.

It means many families are sitting in the living room together but all watching different content on different devices.

Families are watching TV on increasingly larger screens, according to Ofcom.

A slow decline in the number of 26-32 inch screens being bought has made way for a surge in the demand for bigger models of 43 inches or more.

The so-called ‘jumbo’ sets made up 15.8 per cent of sales in the first quarter of this year – more than triple the amount sold in 2008.

Some 41 per cent of households have chosen to invest in just one television and the number of children with TVs in their bedroom has dropped by 17 per cent.

In the first quarter of this year, 52 per cent had a TV in their room compared with 69 per cent in 2007.

The report also revealed that the rise of electronic communication has prompted a boom in mail revenue.

Four in ten of those surveyed said they had received a parcel in the last month, reflecting the growing popularity of online shopping.

A similar number said they had sent a personal letter recently and 58 per cent an invitation, greetings card or postcard.

As a result the post industry secured revenue of £7.2billion in 2012, a 7 per cent rise on the previous year.

While
this might resolve the issue of remote control battles, clinical 
psychologist Linda Blair warned that missing out on the shared 
experience of programme watching could have a negative impact.

Dr Blair said: ‘There is so much more 
loneliness these days because we’re missing out on physical contact with
others and this is just another example.

‘The
move away from the shared message, so that you have something to talk 
about afterwards, is an obvious flaw if you have a family all watching 
different things and my worry is that this will lead to the ignoring of 
the people who really matter.’

She added: ‘The light that is emitted from our electronic devices affects the melatonin levels in our body and makes us much more alert and wakeful than we want to be and is one of the main contributions to insomnia now.

‘I get a huge number of kids who are unable to concentrate, or can’t get to sleep at night and one of the key things we work on is reducing screen time.’

The report also found that when people do choose to watch programmes on a television set, they will often be doing something else on a tablet, smart phone or laptop simultaneously.

According to the report, more than 50 per cent of viewers divide their attention between watching the TV screen and surfing the net, talking to friends or shopping online, and 25 per cent take to social networking sites such as Twitter to discuss what they are watching.

Ofcom’s director of research, James Thickett, said: ‘Just a few years ago, we would be talking about last night’s TV at work or at school.

'Now, we’re having those conversations live while watching TV – using social media, text and instant messaging.’
