After calling time on his glorious 15-year career with Barcelona, Carles Puyol has evidently found some highly effective ways to pass the time and keep himself in shape.

The 36-year-old retired at the end of last summer with 21 trophies to his name and has taken up the pursuits of weightlifting and yoga with girlfriend Vanessa Lorenzo lending a hand.

A few days after Puyol posted Instagram pictures of his better half balanced on top of him in an elaborate yoga pose, he has now recorded a video to show off his strength.

Laid on his back, Puyol bench presses his girlfriend, who does very well to maintain her balance.

The
 centre-back, who captained the Catalan side for a decade, is clearly 
keeping in shape despite a series of knee problems forcing him into 
retirement.

But a glorious new career as a yoga instructor or weightlifter could now await.
