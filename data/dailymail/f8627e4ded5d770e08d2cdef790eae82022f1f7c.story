A friend of classroom murderer Will Cornick has revealed how he is ‘haunted with guilt’ for failing to speak up about the teenager’s threats to kill his teacher.

Cornick attacked Spanish teacher Ann Maguire after boasting to classmates at Corpus Christi College in Leeds that he wanted to kill her.

Now one of his friends has told how he is riddled with guilt for failing to inform school bosses about the threats.

The 16-year-old said he did not tell teachers because he did not believe Cornick would act on what he had said.

He told the Daily Mirror: 'I don’t think about it as much as I did. I try not to. But I do still feel guilty because If I’d told someone, she would be alive today. I could have stopped it.

‘I didn’t tell the teachers because I really never thought he would do anything.

‘I thought he was just trying to scare us. I thought it was bravado - just a sick, terrible joke. I just thought it was a teenage thing.’

Cornick, 16, knifed Mrs Maguire to death at the school in April this year. 

He also said he was going to murder other teachers, including a pregnant woman ‘so as to kill her unborn child’. 

The killing, at Corpus Christi Catholic College in Leeds, shocked Britain and is believed to be the first time a teacher has been killed by a student in the classroom in the UK

He later told doctors: ‘I said I was going to do other stuff but I never got the chance, other murders. It was a triple homicide.’

After the murder the teenager told psychiatrists that he ‘couldn't give a s***’ and added: ‘Everything I've done is fine and dandy.’ 

Cornick was sentenced to life in jail earlier this month and a judge warned him he may never be released.

Judge Mr Justice Coulson called the murder a 'monumental act of cowardice and evil' and branded the teenager's pride and lack of remorse over his actions 'truly grotesque'.

Cornick was initially taken to Wetherby Young Offender Institution (YOI) in West Yorkshire before being moved for his own safety.
