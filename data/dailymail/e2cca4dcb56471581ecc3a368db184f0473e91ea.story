The number of instances of Big Baby 
Syndrome - also known as macrosomia - is rising in both developing 
countries like China and Algeria, as well as Western nations, according 
to a study published in medical journal The Lancet last year.

The
 study found that developed countries have seen a 15 to 25per cent 
increase in babies weighing over 8lbs, 13oz - the weight at which a 
newborn is considered 'oversized' - in the past two to three decades.

In Algeria, where 30per cent of mothers are obese, the number of oversized newborns has seen a 15per cent increase.

The
 report also states that 6.9 per cent of babies in China are born 
'oversized' - compared to just 0.5.per cent in India, where maternal 
obesity is only 3.6per cent.

On to a winner: 'Little Fat' may be the heaviest baby ever to be born in China, beating off the competition with an extra 0.5lb

Exactly
 why the world is seeing more and more overweight newborns is unknown, 
but experts say it could have to do with rising obesity rates and poor 
diets in mothers.

One danger
 is that big babies are at risk of shoulder dystocia, where a newborn's 
shoulders are too big to fit through its mother's pelvic bone during 
delivery.

This can lead to babies having of broken or fractured bones, and mothers can suffer trauma and tearing.

The largest baby ever recorded was born in Canada to mother Anna Bates in 1879, a boy weighing 23lb 12oz, who died 11 hours later.

In 2005 a Brazilian woman gave birth to a 17lb baby boy named Admilton dos Santos.

He was mother Francisca’s fifth child and it is thought that his size was caused by gestational diabetes.
