Harry Kane's participation in this summer’s Under 21 European Championship is in doubt after it emerged that Tottenham are considering a post-season friendly in Malaysia.

Spurs are committed to an exhibition match against Sydney FC in Australia on May 30 and are to hold talks about a friendly in Kuala Lumpur on the way.

Kane, 21, has been told he will travel to Australia with the rest of the squad and would also be in the party stopping off in Malaysia for another lucrative end-of-season game.

Spurs boss Mauricio Pochettino has expressed his fears about burn-out for the Premier League’s joint leading goalscorer as he prepares to make his England debut against Lithuania.

The FA are in talks with Kane and Tottenham officials, including Pochettino, about playing for Gareth Southgate’s England Under 21 team in the Czech Republic.

But negotiations have become increasingly tense because of Tottenham’s commitments in Australia after the final game of the season on May 24.

Pochettino wants Kane to miss this summer’s tournament to make sure he has enough recovery time before the start of next season, but the striker wants to play in the championship.

Kane has been told he will not be required for the senior friendly against the Republic of Ireland on June 7 or a Euro 2016 qualifier in Slovenia a week later. Instead he is wanted by Southgate for the Under 21 tournament which runs from June 17-30.

Meanwhile, Roy Hodgson will attend the World Cup draw in July as England manager but with no assurances that he will be in charge for the campaign to reach Russia in 2018.

Hodgson is keen to extend his contract which will expire next year, although FA chairman Greg Dyke has warned him that negotiations may not begin for another 12 months.

‘I get on quite well with Roy and we chat all the time but we have not talked about contracts yet,’ said Dyke.

‘We genuinely haven’t discussed it. We will have that discussion in the next nine months to a year.

‘When we decided in Brazil that we wanted Roy to continue with his contract, we thought, “He’s got a contract, he sees it through”. Some time in the next year we will discuss what happens afterwards.’

The draw for the World Cup qualifiers is in St Petersburg on July 25. Hodgson will represent England but Dyke plans to miss the event after reacting to a tough 2014 World Cup draw by making a cut-throat gesture. ‘Roy will go, I’m not allowed after what happened last time,’ he said.

England are cruising towards Euro 2016 after winning the first four qualifiers to establish a six-point lead at the head of a group from which the top two go through automatically.

Hodgson will be 70 at the time of the World Cup in Russia but has proved a popular manager with FA chiefs and players alike since he replaced Fabio Capello in 2012. The Euro 2016 qualification process has been so tame, however, that a final decision on his contract may even be shelved until after the finals.

‘Without being disrespectful, this group isn’t the toughest,’ said centre half Phil Jagielka. ‘Time will tell in the tournament. There is a bit of pressure on and that is when the judgment will be clearer. We need to have a good tournament in France to back him if Roy is going to stay on, and the boys are desperate to do that. He’s a likeable person and a good man-manager.’
