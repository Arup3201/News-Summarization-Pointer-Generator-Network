A woman broke down in tears in a West Virginia court after being found not guilty in her father-in-law's murder trial in what prosecutors claimed was a drug-related robbery gone wrong.

Rebecca Hatcher was suspected of killing Thomas Hatcher, her husband's father and the former mayor of their town of War, West Virginia who she lived with at the time of his death.

In the trial, witnesses described the acrimonious relationship between the two and said that the 72-year-old would lock his bedroom at night so that he wouldn't be robbed in his sleep.

'I would never hurt him,' Rebecca said during her time on the stand.

Overjoyed: Rebecca Hatcher, 32, was found not guilty of murdering her father-in-law

Emotional: Hatcher, 32, is not done with her legal drama as a mistrial has been filed regarding her charge of conspiracy (seen here on Wednesday)

The Hatcher family has faced some problems in the past as a result of the mayor's son's drug addiction, which Tom Hatcher opened up about in an interview with Playboy just months before his death. In the article, he revealed that Rebecca,
 Tom's son John Hatcher and their then-11-year-old son lived in a spare 
room in the Mayor's house and he made the decision to lock his door at 
night because John had previously stolen money to buy prescription 
pills.

Helping: Mayor Thomas Hatcher had his drug addict son and his wife and child living with him in his home at the time that he was found dead

'I hate living like this. I hate being an addict, but I can't shake it,' John told the interviewer.

John went to rehab four times at different programs. His name was never mentioned during the trial and is currently in prison on an unrelated charge.

Local station WVNSTV reports that the 32-year-old woman was found not guilty of first degree murder, but the case does not close there as the judge declared a mistrial in the conspiracy charge against her.

Her brother, Earl Click, is suspected of being involved with the mayor's death and will be tried for first degree murder as well but not until next year.

A lack of evidence undoubtedly helped Ms Hatcher's case, as she claimed she was out of town on the night of her father-in-law's murder. The prosecution had nothing to prove her claim false.

'The only person that had access to his bedroom because unbeknownst to him she had gotten the key is the defendant, Becky,' county prosecutor Edward Kornish said in the trial.

Their would-be smoking gun came from 
the discovery of a plastic bag in the elderly man's bedroom which the 
prosecutor claims the alleged suspects used to suffocate him.

The mayor's cause of death has not been reported.

Rebecca's
 defense attorney said that the fact that the bag was in the room should
 be used as a point in her favor, not against her.

Remote: War, West Virginia only has 862 residents and the surrounding area is one of the areas in the country hardest-hit by prescription drug abuse

'Why'd they leave the bag behind?' lawyer Keith Flinchurn said.

'The one item that is supposed to have smothered and killed Tom Hatcher... they leave it behind.'

The small town of War, made up of only 862 people and located in the southern part of the state by the Virginia and Kentucky borders, was rocked by Mr Hatcher's death.

Though Rebecca, who is known in the area as Becky, has been cleared of the murder charge, commentors on the case see it as a judicial mistake.

'What a SHAME! This is not justice. What is wrong with the State's Prosecution?' wrote one unidentified reader of the local NBC affiliate.Â 

'This
 should have been an open and shut case-guilty. It is no secret that she
 wished Tom to die. How many times did Becky instigate arguments with 
him? She often referred to Tom as "old hateful" or "walking death."

Unusual circumstances: Rebecca, her 11-year-old son and husband were all living in her father-in-law's house because of her husband John's drug addiction

'Tom tried to give Becky a chance at a decent life and the opportunity to be a mother to her son as well as a home to live in. Instead, Becky chose to throw all that away for a life of drugs and thievery. She was an ungrateful, narcissistic virago towards Tom.'

Another commentor who used the username of 'candice' suggested the 12-person jury was prejudicial.

'This trial should have been moved out of the state, for a fair trial to have been given,' the person wrote.

'Even without all of the overwhelming evidence against her, there are so many testimonies against her, that should have been enough alone to convict her!'
