An inquiry has been started into the 'act of vandalism' by the singer after he defaced the side of a £23 million hotel in the early hours of Tuesday morning.

And a police spokesman said the Canadian could be arrested when he next tries to enter Brazil.

The singer, 19, along with friends and
 bodyguards, was seen spraying the wall in the city's upmarket district

 singer was later reported to have stuck up his middle finger and 
shouted 'suck my d***' to photographers trying to snap him in the act.

He was later spotted exercising on the nearby Barra de Tijuca beach.

Last
 night, officers entered the private mansion rented by Bieber during his
 stay in Brazil, but the singer had already left the country.

Today
 Bieber's Brazilian bodyguards were giving statements at a police 
station in Rio's Gavea district after the hotel's owners confirmed they 
had not given the singer permission for the graffiti.

He is now in Paraguay, where he will perform in capital Asuncion tonight.

Rio's
 military police today confirmed they had also started an investigation 
into why officers, who arrived at the scene after being called by 
photographers, failed to arrest the star.

Bieber
 arrived in Brazil on Friday, reserving an entire floor in the famous 
Copacabana Palace hotel where he stayed in the presidential suite.

His
 controversial passage through the country began that night, when he was
 seen leaving a high-class brothel in the city, covered in a bed sheet.

According to reports, he paid for two prostitutes to return with him to the hotel, which refused to let them enter.

Bieber
 reportedly tried other hotels in the beachside city before heading to a
 rented mansion in a luxury condo in Rio's Joa district, where he stayed
 and later threw a party for 30 hand-picked girls.

On
 Saturday the singer cut short his show in Sao Paulo, storming off the 
stage after a water bottle thrown from the crowd knocked his microphone 
out of his hand.

Instead of 
staying to sing his most famous hit, Baby, he took a private jet - and a
 number of women - back to Rio where he partied in a nightclub until the
 early hours.

Bieber came 
under further fire yesterday after a video emerged showing fans who had 
paid £800 for a 'meet and greet' with the star being allowed just 
seconds in the same room before being manhandled to the exit by 
bodyguards.

MailOnline have requested a comment from Bieber's representatives.
