Every day for 21 years, Billy Ray Wheelock woke up behind bars while the world outside moved on without him.

So when the 51-year-old was granted clemency by President Obama, he decided to make up for what he had missed.

After his release from a halfway house in Denver, Colorado, he refused to be 'free and unhappy', so he got married, had a Starbucks, got his hair cut and went for his first swim in nearly two decades.

Now he is on the 'other side of the wall' he is planning on starting a consulting service to help prisoners stay out of trouble and help them apply for clemency.

After his release, he told the Denver Post: 'I never accepted my life sentence. I never got institutionalized because I never let the system be my life.'

Mr Wheelock was 29-years old when he got life in prison for possession of and conspiracy to distribute 99.62 grams of crack cocaine.

When he was jailed in 1992, sentencing laws were harsher because the substance was deemed to be dangerously addictive.  

He has been in custody ever since and and has been forced to watch his children grow into teenagers from the confines of his cell.

'I watched the world change, I saw TV and everything. I just wasn't a part of it,' he said.

It took him under a minute to say his goodbyes to guards at the correctional facility and walk through a rusty gate to where his fiance, mother-of-two Berna Lang, 64, was waiting.

Two days later the pair, who met on a Muslim dating website, tied the knot after being engaged for a year in Englewood, Colorado. 

He has moved into a small apartment with her and claims she won his heart because she accepted that 'life means life'.

The sentence will stay on his criminal record despite his release, but he claims the term handed to him by a Texas Court in 1993 was too harsh.

He said: 'I would've still been in prison today if I had not been granted executive clemency. I'm not claiming innocence. 

'I wasn't granted a pardon. I'm just saying the punishment I received wasn't warranted. It was overkill.' 

In his first five years, Obama has granted 40 out of 10,001 clemency and pardon petitions received. 

Mr Wheelock's successful application came after severe mandatory minimums enacted in 1986 for crack offenders were reduced in 2010.

Testing the water: Still wearing his ankle monitor, he also took his first swim in nearly two decades 

He did not know he was eligible to apply for clemency until 2005, after someone mentioned it in passing.

So, in a bid to be released, he turned himself into a model inmate by enrolling in education programmes and staying out of trouble. 

He was told his application was successful in December, after the President said there had been a 'disparity' in his sentence.

Obama shortened the terms of Wheelock and seven other men and women serving long prison terms for cocaine-related crimes.

The President wrote: 'Commuting the sentences of these eight Americans is an important step toward restoring fundamental ideals of justice and fairness.But it must not be the last.'

Yielding to changes in public perception, Congress and Obama in 2010 passed the Fair Sentencing Act that changed that formula to treat one gram of crack cocaine like 18 grams of powder.

Congress is now considering the Smarter Sentencing Act of 2014 that would make reduced sentencing available to those convicted before the 2010 law change.
