Julian Speroni has had a great start to the season with Crystal Palace - and life at home looks to be happy too as he poses with his newborn daughter Isabella for the first time.

The 35-year-old Argentine stopper has already got the new addition to his family dressed in club colours, with a wool hat in Palace's famous claret and light blue stripes.

Speroni, who is in his 10th season at Selhurst Park, has helped Palace to defy the critics with a decent start to the new campaign under returning boss Neil Warnock.

Isabella Speroni is already showing off the Crystal Palace colours, after being born on Thursday October 9

And after a decade in London, Speroni is not afraid to show off his support for the club - as seen by his daughter's choice of headgear. 

And the Palace link continues - with the pictures of Isabella being taken by Kels Noades, daughter of the late former Palace chairman Ron Noades.

Ron oversaw the most successful period in Palace's history including promotion to an FA Cup final in 1990, a third-placed finish in the First Division, and their Zenith Data Systems Cup win in 1991.  

Speroni is in his 10th year at Palace and says that he loves the club - and the pictures of his newborn show it

Isabella was born at Tunbridge Wells Hospital weighing 2.84kg. She is a sister for Speroni's son Thiago

Speroni has previously said that he feels like part of the family at Palace, and now his daughter has caught the bug early following her birth at Tunbridge Wells hospital last Thursday (October 9).

And while she might keep the Eagles legend up through the night for a few weeks, Speroni will hope he can give the likes of Diego Costa nightmares when he faces up to the Premier League top scorer at Selhurst Park on Saturday.
