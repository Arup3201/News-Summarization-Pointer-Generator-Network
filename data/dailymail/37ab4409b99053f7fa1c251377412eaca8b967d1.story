 Wonder bread is back on US shelves today after being out of stores for almost a year.

A nostalgia for snack foods like twinkies and other Wonder Bread products was sparked when Hostess suspended production in November of last year. Avid snack food fans flocked to stores to scoop up as many twinkies as their arms could carry for fear that they would never be able to purchase Hostess snacks again. 

The Hostess snacks' newfound popularity 
helped to liquidate funds after years of financial turmoil and failure 
to reach a new contract with it's baker's union.

Wonder Bread and other Hostess products like twinkies returned to the shelves of US grocery stores today

As a result, Flower Foods (FLO) known
 for producing Tastykake snacks and nature's own bread bought 
Wonderbread and most of Hostess' other bread brands for a whopping $360 
million. The other 
well-known hostess snack brands like Twinkies, Ho Hos, and Ding Dongs 
were sold for $140 million by private equity firms Apollo Global 
Management (APO) and Metropoulos & Co.

Companies
 are hoping to capitalize on the brand's nostalgia. Flower Foods said they are going to use a twinkies recipe 
'from an earlier time.'

According to the president of Hostess, Richard Seban, Hostess cakes are known for three basic textures: the spongy cake, the creamy filling and the thicker icing. But he said different textures - such as crunchy - could be introduced, as well as different flavors.

They also plan to advertise trendy health attributes such as gluten-free, added fiber, low sugar and low sodium.

The bread products will be made at all of the same Hostess Plants which were acquired in the sale. Flower Foods currently sells food in three-quarters of the country but is hoping to expand.
