The cheap Albuquerque, New Mexico motel that Bill Gates and Paul Allen called home in the early days of Microsoft now has a new life as affordable housing.

The future billionaires checked into the Sundowner Hotel in 1975, the same year they founded Microsoft, but the once popular motor hotel was by then just a shadow of its former glory.

The motel officially closed five years ago when it was overtaken by squatters, prostitutes and drug users.

The birthplace of Microsoft: The Albuquerque, New Mexico motel that housed Bill Gates and Paul Allen in 1975 as they were developing Microsoft has now been turned into affordable housing. Above, views of the hotel during its heyday.

But a company has since purchased the building and given it a makeover, turning the motel into an affordable apartment complex housing the mentally ill, students and working families.

Originally opened in 1960, the Sundowner was once a glimmering motel on America's famous Route 66.

In it's heyday, locals and out-of-towners alike flocked to stay at the Sundowner, with it's pool, casino, nightclub and restaurant.

But when Interstate 40 was completed in 1970, traffic slowed on the famous roadway and the hotel fell into disrepair.

John Bloomfield, executive director of New Life Homes, visited the motel in 2009 and called the trip 'an emotional encounter'.

Bloomfield decided to buy the building and save it from demolition, instead turning the property into low-income housing.

The motel was resdesigned by Garret Smith Ltd and construction started in April 2013.

The Sundowner has since been turned into 71 units, ranging from studios to three-bedroom apartments. The property now includes a sand volleyball court, garden and gazebo with a special display case explaining the Microsoft history.

Tenants started moving in in October and not there is 'no vacancy'.
