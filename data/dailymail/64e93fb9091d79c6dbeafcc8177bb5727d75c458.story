Raiding the cupboards for food is a well-known effect of smoking cannabis.

But for years, scientists have been unable to understand why cannabis’ active ingredient, tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), causes such a powerful surge in appetite.

Now a European study has revealed that people get ‘the munchies’ after using marijuana because their sense of smell and taste is heightened.

Scientists claim the findings could be used to develop treatments that better tackle obesity and loss of appetite, according to a report in the New Scientist.

A group of neuroscientists, led by Giovanni Marsicano of the University of Bordeaux, found that in mice, THC fits into receptors in the brain's olfactory bulb.

This dramatically increases the creature’s ability to smell food and leading them to eat more of it, they said in a study published in Nature Neuroscience.

Regularly
 smoking marijuana over a number of years can affect your short-term 
memory, according to another study by Giovanni Marsicano.

Long-term
 smokers may notice that they cannot temporarily hold information in 
their heads, like a telephone number or the name of someone they have 
just met.

A teams of 
scientists claim that this common side effect occurs because the drug 
hinders a signalling mechanism between neurons and non-neuronal cells 
called astrocytes.

The 
study examined the role of the astrocytes, which have long been 
considered nothing more than support cells that protect neurons.

The
 researchers found that tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), the psychoactive 
ingredient of marijuana, weakens the connections between neurons in the 
hippocampus, a structure that is crucial for memory formation.

The
 team came to this conclusion after injecting mice with THC and giving 
them a series of memory tests, such as forcing them to remember the 
location of an underwater platform in order to emerge from a miniature 
swimming pool.

Scientists exposed a group of mice to banana and almond oils as a test of sensitivity to scent.

These mice sniffed the oils at first, and then stopped showing interest. But mice that were given THC carried on sniffing. The THC-dosed mice also ate much more.

Researchers then genetically engineered some mice to lack a type of cannabinoid receptor in their olfactory bulbs and subjected them to the same experiment.

Even if these mice were given THC, it had no effect, revealing the drug's scent-enhancing powers involved activity in this region of the brain.

The group explained that by making the sense of smell and taste more acute, THC creates the same sensations felt when people deprived of food.

If the findings hold true for humans, it may help develop treatments for appetite disorders by changing the link between smell and appetite.
