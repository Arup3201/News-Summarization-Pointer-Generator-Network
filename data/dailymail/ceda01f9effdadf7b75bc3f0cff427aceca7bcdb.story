Missing: Michaela 'Mickey' Shunick went missing on May 19 and her body has still not been recovered

A registered sex offender has been arrested in connection with the disappearance of a Louisiana college student.

Brandon Scott Lavergne, 33, was booked last night on first-degree murder and aggravated kidnapping charges by police in Lafayette, where University of Louisiana student Mickey Shunick went missing on May 19.

St. Landry Parish Sheriff Bobby Guidroz said the arrest came as his department helped Lafayette police search Lavergne's residence for evidence.

The search was continuing last night, but the sheriff had no details on what was
found.

And Lafayette police have released no details. Police have scheduled
a 1pm news conference for today to discuss an arrest in the case.

It was not immediately clear if Lavergne has an attorney.

The
rural St. Landry address where the search was conducted is listed as 
the address of Lavergne on the state's sex offender website.

The website says Lavergne was convicted in 2000 of aggravated oral sexual battery. He was released in 2008.

He was reportedly on probation until 2010, and is listed as a Tier 3 sex offender, the most serious classification. Tier 3 offenders must register with the national sex offender registry for life, according to the sex offender website.

Shunick was last seen shortly before 2am on May 19, days before her 22nd birthday.

Last seen: The University of Louisiana at Lafayette student had left a friend's house to ride her bicycle home

The University of Louisiana at Lafayette student had left a friend's house to ride her bicycle home.

Her bicycle was found eight days later in a remote, swampy area under a highway bridge in Iberville Parish, about 25 miles from the spot where she was last seen.

Soon after her disappearance, 
Lafayette police released video taken about the time she went missing. 
It showed her cycling on a Lafayette street around 1.45am on May 19.

Investigators said at the time that they were seeking information about a pickup truck seen on the video.

Continued search: The case engulfed the entire area and continues to absorb attention

The sex offender website shows a white 2011 Chevrolet Silverado under vehicles linked to Lavergne.

Volunteers at the Find Mickey Shunick headquarters in the nearby South College Shopping Centre were told of the news last night.

Co-ordinator Margaret Bearb said: 'It's almost like we all took a deep breath. This is the first time since this happened that the family has been able to take a breath.'

'I think it's more of a shock than anything else. We're on our 47th day, and here we are.'

And Shunick's sister, Charlie, told thetowntalk.com via text message that: 'We are relieved that the police have made an arrest.

'The circumstances are pretty distressing. If she is gone, it is a void in the fabric of the world and a devastating blow to our family.'

According to Louisiana law, first-degree murder includes 'the killing of a human being - when the offender has specific intent to kill or to inflict great bodily harm and is engaged in the perpetration of aggravated kidnapping'.

Reward: Her friends issued a 
$25,000 reward has been issued for any information leading to her 
whereabouts

Best friends: Mickey and her sister, pictured in happier times before she went missing

The law defines aggravated kidnapping as 'the forcible seizing and carrying of any person from one place to another; or the enticing or persuading of any person to go from one place to another; or the imprisoning or forcible secreting of any person.'

If a district attorney seeks a capital verdict in a first-degree murder case, the crime can come with a sentence of death or life in prison.
