Incredible new images from the surface of Mars have provided a new glimpse into the NASA mission, including more possible evidence that there was once water on the on the Red Planet.

They are the latest in a series of snaps from the Martian landscape that have come courtesy of the Curiosity rover, which has been on the planet since August 5.

The new photos came on the heels of an incredible photo from Mars' surface that appeared to be a flower blooming among the rocks.

But those hoping the flower would unlock evidence of life on other planets may be saddened to learn that the 'Martian flower' is nothing more than another rock.

The space agency said on Monday that the 'flower' was a particularly shiny piece of sediment in the area.

Some of the images show veins in the rock that may hold clues to history of water on Mars.

Meanwhile, scientists have zeroed in on a target area for Curiosity to begin drilling: A rock outcrop as flat as a pool table that's expected to yield fresh insight into the red planet's history.

Running a bit behind schedule, Curiosity was due to arrive at the site in the next several days.

After an inspection of the surroundings, the car-size rover will test its drill for the first time 'probably in the next two weeks,' project manager Richard Cook of the NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory said Tuesday.

The highly anticipated drilling has been billed as the most complex engineering task since the acrobatic landing inside a Martian crater last summer.

Curiosity is on a quest to determine whether environmental conditions could have been favorable for microbes.

By boring into a rock and transferring the powder to the rover's onboard chemistry lab and other instruments, scientists should get a better understanding of the region's mineral and chemical makeup.

'We're thrilled, and we can't wait to get drilling,' said project scientist John Grotzinger of the California Institute of Technology.

Previous rovers Opportunity and Spirit carried a grinding tool that peeled away rock layers.

Curiosity is capable of drilling down several inches to collect a sample from the interior - a first on Mars.

Opportunity is still operating on the surface of Mars, but Spirit lost contact with Earth in 2010.

Since the $2.5billion Curiosity mission launched in 2011, engineers have been troubleshooting an issue with the rover's drill in which flakes of Teflon can break off and get mixed with the rock samples. 

Cook said the contamination should not affect the mission.'We are reasonably confident that it's something that we'll be able to work our way around,' he said.

As the most high-tech interplanetary rover, Curiosity has been on a slow streak since its action-packed arrival.

Grotzinger said the pace of the mission was '100 per cent discovery-driven' and can't be rushed.

Already, Curiosity has lingered longer than expected at its current location because scientists have been captivated by the sedimentary rocks that differ from the pebbles found at the landing site.

After some last-minute studies, the rover will head to the rock outcrop dubbed 'John Klein' after a mission team member who died in 2011.

Curiosity's ultimate goal is to drive to the base of Mount Sharp, a six-month journey with no stops. The plan is to begin the road trip after drilling is complete with pauses along the way.
