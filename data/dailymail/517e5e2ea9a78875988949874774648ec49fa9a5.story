Ballon d'Or winner Cristiano Ronaldo has ended his relationship with Irina Shayk after the she refused to attend his mother's 60th birthday party according to a newspaper in Portugal. 

Coreio de Manhana reported that Shayk had told Ronaldo that she would not be attending the bash in his native Madeira, and the ensuing row served to end the pair's five-year romance.  

As a parting dig to Ronaldo, the Russian model has now stopped following him on Twitter.

Ronaldo and Shayk reportedly split because the Russian model refused to attend his mother's birthday

A source told Coreio de Manhana: 'Cristiano wanted to surprise his mum and as he spent Christmas with Irina in Dubai, he had planned to be with his mum on her birthday, but Irina didn't want to go.

'They had such a big row that he ended up spending New Years Eve alone with his son.

'Irina mouthed off about Dolores and Ronaldo took sides with him mum. It was the straw that broke the camel's back because they had hadn't been getting on well in the last few months.'

The newspaper also claimed Irina decided to stay in a hotel during one of her recent trips to Madrid because Dolores, who watched proudly as her son won his third Ballon d'Or on Monday, was at Cristiano's luxury home on the exclusive estate La Finca.

'Dolores thinks Irina wasn't the right woman for Ronaldo's son,' the source continued. 'She wanted someone who would, in the future, assume the role of mum for Cristiano Jr. That wasn't a priority for Irina.'

Along with Dolores, Cristiano is raising four-year-old son Cristiano Jr, whose mother's identity has been fiercely guarded by the sportsman.

Cristiano's mother, Dolores, didn't believe that Irina was a suitable mother figure for her grandson

Irina's dramatic Twitter unfollow came after she failed to support Ronaldo in Zurich on Monday when he was awarded the prestigious FIFA Ballon d'Or award.

Cristiano also noticeably failed to mention Irina's name during his acceptance speech.

'It's an unforgettable moment in my life to win the Ballon d'Or for the third time,' Ronaldo said after claiming football's most prestigious individual award for the second consecutive year. 

'I feel extremely happy and proud to receive this award and I want to keep challenging myself every day.

'I have to thank my family, all the people who support me and also my colleagues of Real Madrid and Portuguese National team that make me a better player every day.'

Irina was by Ronaldo's side when he collected the prestigious Ballon d'Or award in 2013

According to Irina's PR representative, the model did not attend the annual FIFA Ballon d'Or awards because she simply had other commitments.

'[The Ballon d'Or] didn't fit in with her schedule,' a spokesperson told Goal.com. 'It was because of work commitments. We have no further comment to make.'

However, some have raised doubts over the explanation as the awards ceremony had been in the calendar for 12 months in advance.

Suspicious fans have also questioned why Irina did not bother to congratulate her estranged boyfriend on any of her social networking accounts either. 

 Irina has been posting pictures of a recent winter getaway on Twitter without Ronaldo

Irina has posted plenty of bikini shots on her Instagram and Facebook pages over the past few days

Rather than congratulating him on his impressive achievement, she instead chose to post pictures of herself on a winter getaway to a mysterious location, where she celebrated her 29th birthday.

Judging by the solo photographs, Cristiano was not there to celebrate Irina's big day with her.

MailOnline has contacted representatives for Irina Shayk and Cristiano Ronaldo for comment.
