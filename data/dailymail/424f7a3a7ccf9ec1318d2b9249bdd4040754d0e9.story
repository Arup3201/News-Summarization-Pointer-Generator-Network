Manchester United are on the trail of Arsenal starlet Chris Willock.

The
15-year-old is one of three footballing brothers. Joe, 13, is at 
Arsenal too and Matty, 17, was released by Arsenal but is now due to
sign a professional contract with United. 

Chris,
a left sided midfielder who can play on the wing or behind the striker,
is one of the brightest talents in English football and has figured for
Arsenal's U18s, making his debut against Manchester City in February, 
but he has yet to sign professional terms and turns 16 on January 31.

He
was player of the tournament at the MTU Indoor Cup in 2012, competing 
against United, Bayern Munich and Barcelona before catching the eye 
again in the Lion City Cup in Singapore last summer and the Nike Cup.

Capped
by England at U16 level, City and Chelsea are also keen on the slightly
built Willock but United hope to have the upper hand to any ensuing 
transfer with elder brother Matty in their ranks.

Joleon Lescott's availability at Manchester City has alerted West Ham United.

Fresh from missing out on John Heitinga, manager Sam Allardyce is weighing up alternatives and would be interested if a subsidised loan can be arranged until the end of the season when Lescott's contract runs out.

City are willing to let the England defender leave on loan should Martin Demichelis shake off his injury but Lescott's estimated £90,000-a-week wages are prohibitive to the Hammers and the likes of Newcastle and even Tottenham, to a degree.

Big decision: Everton centre back John Heitinga decided against joining the Hammers

Besiktas are willing to pay around £2million a year tax free in wages and offer the 31-year-old a two-year contract and the promise of longer-term deals elsewhere at this stage could be difficult to find.

Lescott has plenty to play for with a World Cup place at stake and is a model professional so clubs will be getting a proven Premier League performer but finances dictate a short term deal may be their best bet.

Monaco are looking at centre backs but Chelsea and City target Kurt Zouma of St Etienne is a preferred option.

Tottenham also have other possibilities in mind.

Keen eye: Sam Allardyce has endured a miserable period following a series of defensive injuries

Allardyce will look at foreign options too should Lescott not fit financially but is eager to bring in Premier League experience among his three planned signings. Rickie Lambert looks like it will be too expensive a project to conclude with Southampton while Everton still want £4m-£5m for Nikica Jelavic who is a target for Crystal Palace also.

Another loan signing up top is desired with numerous players still being discussed, however John Guidetti of Manchester City is leaning more towards a loan move to Stoke.

Napoli have no intention of entertaining any bids for Gonzalo Higuain. Chelsea have shown interest in the former Real Madrid striker but the Italians say they have had no offer after telling all suitors not to waste their time.

Higuain has become a cult figure for the passionate Napoli fans who craved a striker to idolise following Edinson Cavani's sale last summer.

Higuain insists he is happy in Italy, saying: 'For someone like me, who loves this sport, Naples is a wonderful place. This is an incredible city where football comes first, followed by everything else. The fans live for football. Thank God they loved me straight away because the Neapolitans are very passionate and I find that enchanting.

No go: Napoli will knock back any overtures for star striker Gonzalo Higuain this transfer window

'The Neapolitans have a special affection for Argentines. They are similar to us as well as having Diego Maradona in their hearts.'

Club president Aurelio De Laurentiis is convinced Rafa Benitez is heading in the right direction with his new-look Napoli project despite narrowly missing out on qualification from the Champions League group stage. Benitez wants a defensive midfielder, a centre back and a left back to help press Juventus and Roma for the title and win the Europa League for a successive year.

He remains a big fan of Chelsea's Juan Mata but has not made any approach for the Spaniard.

Napoli say they have had no approach from Liverpool for 17-year-old right back Armando Anastasio.

Liverpool, meanwhile, are reluctant to loan out Raheem Sterling despite enquiries from Premier League sides. They are also yet to reach agreement with Basle for forward Mohamed Salah but talks are ongoing.

One winger keen on a return to England is former Chelsea man Salomon Kalou, 28, who has attracted interest from Tottenham, Arsenal, West Ham and Liverpool in the past and is available for £2.5m from Lille.

A few Championship club scouts have been beating a path to Cowdenbeath's Central Park this season.

The focus of their attention is former Rangers striker Kane Hemmings. The 21-year-old, who has been likened in style to a young Stan Collymore by some observers, was born in Burton upon Trent and had trials for Derby County and Birmingham as a boy.

He was signed by non-League Tamworth at 13 and from there was picked up by Rangers where he graduated to become captain of their U19 team before making his debut as a substitute against Malmo in the Champions League.

Most wanted: Kane Hemmings is being watched by a number of Championship clubs

However, three knee injuries derailed his progress and following Rangers' liquidation he moved to Cowdenbeath on loan. He scored four goals in seven games prompting Rangers to recall him but finances dictated he had to go and he rejoined Cowdenbeath where he has scored 16 goals in 23 games this season.

Hemmings, whose father Tony scored for Macclesfield Town at Wembley in the 1996 FA Trophy Final win over Northwich Victoria, is out of contract in the summer but the Scottish Championship side would be willing to sell now for around £50,000 and that has some clubs thinking he would be worth the gamble in England.

Which
one-time Manchester United transfer target is considering getting a new
tattoo after team-mates gave him constant ribbing over one he has on his
arm of the Teletubbies which he had done to remind him of his children? 

QPR, Leicester, Burnley and Bolton will all be represented as Halifax Town visit Tamworth in the Conference on Saturday. On show is Halifax Town striker Lee Gregory who has scored 15 goals in 19 games this season and would have had more but for a broken hand which forced him to miss 10 games.

The 25-year-old scored two in three minutes against Gateshead on New Year's Day and has had the likes of MK Dons following his form. However, now Championship sides are also watching to see what the fuss is about. Gregory is hoping to tread a similar path to former Halifax striker Jamie Vardy, now at Leicester.

Halifax manager Neil Aspin, who is aiming for promotion, joked: 'Any scouts that were at the game should look at the third chance he had, the one where he missed, and leave him where he is with us. He’s rubbish! No, he took both his goals well, as he has done all season. He gets into good areas and what can I say, he knows where the goal is.'

Meanwhile, Forest Green Rovers have signed Lee Hughes, 37, on an 18-month contract from League One Port Vale.

Derby County are poised to sign Tottenham's Simon Dawkins for £500,000. The 26-year-old midfielder, who has had spells with San Jose Earthquakes and Aston Villa, has been on loan at Derby and impressed boss Steve McClaren.

Nottingham Forest are continuing to bang on the door at West Bromwich Albion. Not content with asking about Shane Long, manager Billy Davies is also keen on midfielder Graham Dorrans. Davies wants to add a goal threat to his Championship promotion chasers and has also enquired about a big money bid for Blackburn Rovers goal machine Jordan Rhodes. However, word is Blackburn won't sell for under £10m.

Fancy it? Nottingham Forest are keen on West Brom hitman Shane Long

Gabriel Tamas, formerly of West Bromwich Albion, is eager to make a return to the Premier League. The 30-year-old is a free agent who moved briefly to FC Cluj in October only for the move to end before it got started after an incident where he was filmed allegedly drunk in a Bucharest pub. Tamas is ready to go on trial at a club to prove he is fit for action and sticking to orange juice.

Manchester United goalkeeper Ben Amos is ready to go out on loan again after returning from a spell at Carlisle United. Wolves may show interest in the 23-year-old with Wayne Hennessey poised to join Crystal Palace after facing Gillingham on Friday.

Carl Ikeme has broken his hand for the second time in 12 months and Wolves have recalled young Irishman Aaron McCarey from loan at York City. Amos impressed at Carlisle and is keen to get more competitive games under his belt with his route to the first team at United blocked by David de Gea and Anders Lindegaard.

Christian Benteke's agent has reaffirmed his belief the Belgium striker will stay at Villa Park this season.

Villa need Benteke even more following the leg break suffered by Libor Kozak yet Benteke has attracted attention from Atletico Madrid, Borussia Dortmund, Juventus, Chelsea, Tottenham and Manchester United again despite his dip in form.

Staying put: Christian Benteke's agent is adamant that his client will remain at Aston Villa for the time being

Kismet Eris, said: 'You have to be realistic. He played on New Year's Day, so to talk of him leaving is ridiculous. There's no question of him leaving at the moment. It wasn't planned at the start of the season, it's not planned now.'

Wigan are looking to sign Leicester City's versatile Jeffrey Schlupp on loan for the rest of the season as Uwe Rosler looks to reshape his squad at the DW Stadium.

The 21-year-old had an extended trial at Manchester United last season where he mainly turned out at left-back but has been playing back on the wing and scored for Leicester at Millwall on New Year's Day after coming on as a substitute.
