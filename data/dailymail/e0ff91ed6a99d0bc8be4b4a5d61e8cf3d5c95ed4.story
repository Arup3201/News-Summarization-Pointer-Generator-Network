Hundreds of Afghans took to the streets of the nation's capital Kabul today to demand the withdrawal of military forces ahead of the tenth anniversary of the U.S. invasion.

The demonstration in the centre of the city was peaceful but many of the participants wore masks or veils to hide their faces and a Stars and Stripes was later burned openly in the street.

The protest was staged to mark the October 7 invasion of Afghanistan in 2001, which followed less than a month after the September 11 terrorist attacks on the Twin Towers

Chants: A woman uses a megaphone to shout slogans including 'no to occupation' and 'Americans out'. The protesters also carried posters of victims of the conflict

The Americans went in when Taliban 
leader Mullah Omar refused to hand over Osama Bin Laden because he 
didn't believe he was behind the atrocity.

The U.S. has subsequently lost more than 1,700 servicemen and women and injected around $18bn into economy, making Afghanistan the biggest recipient of aid from the country.

The war has also cost the lives of 
2,749 military personnel in total, including 1,798 from the United 
States, 382 from the UK and 569 from other nations. There are currently more than 130,000 troops in Afghanistan, with about 98,000 from the United States.

The foreign aid has been spent on 
creating projects in a bid to stabilise the country and in an attempt to
win the 'hearts and minds' of the population.

Even
today the International Monetary Fund has reached an agreement with the
Afghan government for a further $129m loan, which will be confirmed 
next month.

The demo, organised by a small left wing political party, saw protesters chant 'no to occupation' and 'Americans out' 
as they marched through the streets holding pictures of Afghans killed 
in violence.

Speaking about the protest, a 22-year-old woman known only as Farzana said: 'The
United States said it came to help the Afghan people and provide a good
life to Afghan people, but their true purpose was to occupy our 
country.

'It is 10 years since the invasion of Afghanistan and all it has left behind is the blood of the Afghan people. We want the U.S. to leave our country.'

She added that 'suicide attacks, insecurity and corruption are increasing day-by-day.'

Elsewhere in the country a child and man were killed after insurgents opened fire on a civilian bus travelling in the Girisk district of Helmand province.

And in southern Uruzgan province, a 
car bomb killed the commander of a highway security force, Wali Jan, as 
he walked out of his home, the police said.

A Danish soldier was also seriously wounded by an explosive device
during an operation in south-western Afghanistan after a blast close to the Danish base in Helamd province.

The Danish Army Operational Command says the soldier was taken by helicopter to a field hospital for treatment.

Denmark, which has about 750 soldiers in Afghanistan, will begin withdrawing them this year and gradually shift its role to the training of Afghan forces.

International forces have begun handing over responsibly for security to Afghan forces and all foreign combat troops are to leave Afghanistan by the end of 2014.

President Obama announced in July that he would pull 10,000 troops out of Afghanistan this year and 23,000 more by next September.

Meanwhile, Pakistan has warned Afghanistan to behave responsibly following Kabul's move to sign a strategic pact with India, at a particularly sensitive time in relations between the two countries.

Afghanistan's interior minister recently accused Pakistan's powerful spy agency, the ISI, of being involved in last month's suicide bombing in Kabul that killed former Afghan President Burhanuddin Rabbani - an allegation denied by Pakistan.

'At this defining stage when challenges have multiplied, as have the opportunities, it is our expectation that everyone, especially those in position of authority in Afghanistan, will demonstrate requisite maturity and responsibility,' Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Tehmina Janjua told reporters.

'This is no time for point-scoring, playing politics or grandstanding.'

Her comments seemed more confrontational than Pakistani Prime Minister Yousuf Raza Gilani's statement which said that Afghanistan and India have the right to maintain bilateral relations as sovereign nations.

The agreement, which was signed on Tuesday, outlined areas of common concern including trade, economic expansion, education, security and politics. It was the first of its kind between Afghanistan and any country.

Afghan President Hamid Karzai, subject of a foiled assassination plot uncovered this week - has tried to assuage concern over the pact, saying it was not intended as an aggressive move against Pakistan.

He said the agreement simply made official years of close ties between India and Afghanistan's post-Taliban government.

'Pakistan is a twin brother. India is a great friend,' said Karzai during a visit to New Delhi, according to the Press Trust of India news agency.

'The agreement that we signed yesterday with our friend will not affect our brother.'
