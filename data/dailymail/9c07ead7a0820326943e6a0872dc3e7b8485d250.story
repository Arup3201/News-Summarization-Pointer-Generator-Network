A Las Vegas woman on trial for hiring someone to kill her husband cried on the stand yesterday as she recalled how he would beat her and said - though she wished him dead - she did not order his murder.

Amy Bessey, 53, is accused of asking her son and her brother to kill her husband as he drove to work in November 2012 so she could cash in on a $250,000 life insurance policy before their divorce was finalized.

Robert Bessey was hit in the neck by a shot fired from a gold SUV in the
 lane next to his about 4:30am, but he survived. He recognized the 
SUV as belonging to the girlfriend of his then-brother-in-law Richard Pearson.Â

Amy Bessey, 53, is accused of asking her son and her brother to kill her husband as he drove to work in November 2012 so she could cash in on a $250,000 life insurance policy before their divorce was finalized

Bessey denied having anything to do with the shooting but admitted she did at one time say, 'I was fed up. I just wanted it to be done. I just said it. I wish he was dead'

On Monday, Bessey denied having anything to do with the shooting but admitted she did at one time say, 'I was fed up. I just wanted it to be done. I just said it. I wish he was dead', but explained it was because she was tired of him and the divorce.

She referred to one incident in May 2012 when he took his 'fist to her face' after she asked about grocery money.

'He took his fist to my face. He took his knee to my rib,' Bessey testified. 'I grabbed my purse and walked out the door.'

She admitted there was a gun in her purse and she could have killed him if she wanted to.

Last week during his testimony, Robert Bessey described the same fight as, 'I was in bed. Amy came in. There was pushing and hitting. I pushed her. She hit me,' ABC reports.

Amy Bessey testified she thought they could save their relationship. 
That was until Robert Bessey pointed a gun at her and Michael Bessey 
upon their return from Texas.

Her son Michael is also accused of attempted murder.

The 43-year-old faces eight charges, including 
solicitation to commit murder, conspiracy and attempted murder with use 
of a deadly weapon. If convicted, she could face two to 91 years in 
prison.

Victim: Richard Bessey, pictured in court last week, survived the attempt on his life and testified in his ex-wife's trial

In the Las Vegas justice court last week, Martinez read out a text message Richard Pearson, 39, sent Bessey prior to the assassination attempt, which said, 'I love it when a plan comes together.'

Accused: Amy Bessey, 43, allegedly plotted to kill her husband for his life insurance policy

'That ladies and gentlemen is a text 
message sent by Ric Pearson to his sister, the defendant, Amy Bessey, 
approximately six hours prior to Robert Bessey being shot in the head,' 
Martinez told jurors.

Bessey survived the attempt on his life and testified in his ex-wife's trial.

He said he was driving his usual route to work at 4:35am November 14 when a gunshot came from a gold SUV.

'I felt a hot sensation here and towards the back of my neck. I start feeling what I believe to be a bullet,' Bessey told the court. 'This is my sweatshirt. You can see the hole in the neck.'

The couple had been married for 18 years and had three kids together. They each had two children from prior relationships and Bessey adopted Amy Bessey's biological son Michael two years after they were married.

Robert Bessey also testified Wednesday that Michael had been pulling away from him to be closer to his wife after he returned from the military months before the shooting.

Bessey said Michael's move back into the home after he was dishonorably discharged caused friction between him and his wife. He said he noticed Michael's relationship with his mother had changed.

'They seemed to be closer or adult conversation, rather than mother-son,' Bessey testified.

Prosecutors also showed the court gas station surveillance video that captured Bessey's brother and son not far from the scene of the shooting in a gold SUV that police say was tied to the incident.

Michael
 Bessey and Pearson 
were charged in the murder plot last year, but police only implicated 
Amy Bessey in January after her son told his cellmate that she had been 
involved.

She was arrested by Las Vegas police 
on charges of attempted murder, battery and conspiracy to commit murder 
against her husband, the Las Vegas Review-Journal reported.

Robert
 Bessey told detectives that his wife and son's 'close' relationship had
 prompted the divorce, while Michael Bessey's ex-girlfriend said Amy was
 also the reason they had broken up.

Relatives claimed the pair had an 'unnatural relationship' and one friend said they would go to nightclubs together and 'grab each other's buttocks', police said.

Plot: Michael Bessey, pictured brandishing a gun on his Facebook page, allegedly told his cellmate that he shot his father to get money from his life insurance plan so he could buy a truck

'Close': Michael Bessey, left, allegedly wrote his mother, right, a letter from jail saying: 'I miss touching you'

Robert Bessey also told police that 
he had read a letter his son had written to his wife from jail which 
said: 'I miss touching you'.

But Amy Bessey was only implicated in the gruesome plot when her son's cellmate, Tremel Palmer, claimed he told him that the three planned the killing and were shocked Mr Bessey survived.

Michael Bessey allegedly told Palmer that he was the one who had fired the bullet. He and Pearson then went to a diner for Amy Bessey to collect them, he allegedly said.

Michael Bessey added that he expected to receive a total of $400,000 from the death, with which he would buy a truck, while his mother would pay off her mortgage, police said.

Bessey said he wanted his father dead because he had physically abused his mother and mentally abused the family, the Journal-Review reported.

He added that he planned to blame the 
plot on his uncle, Richard Pearson, who recently finished a prison 
sentence, by claiming the man had forced him to get involved at 
gunpoint.

In an eerie twist following the shooting, Amy Pearson cooperated with police and handed over her brother and her son to police by identifying them in a video taken at a gas station near the scene.

After her son was arrested last November, she told the Review-Journal: 'I have no idea what's going on. I wish I did.'

Michael Bessey, Richard Pearson and Amy Pearson have all been charged with attempted murder with a deadly weapon, conspiracy to commit murder and battery with a deadly weapon resulting in substantial bodily harm. Richard Pearson was also charged with violation of parole.

Their trial is scheduled for February 2014.
