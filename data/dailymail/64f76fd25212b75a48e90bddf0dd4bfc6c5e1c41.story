This house might feature phantom footsteps, a howling poltergeist and ghostly reflections in the bathroom mirror, but at least you won't be spooked by its price tag.

Gregory Leeson has put his Marion Street, Pennsylvania home on the market  for just $144,000 - and he has assured potential buyers it's not so eerie.

'Slightly haunted. Nothing serious, though. e.g. The sounds of phantom footsteps. A strange knocking sound followed by a very quiet (hardly noticeable, even) scream at 3:13am, maybe once a week. Twice a week, tops,' the property listing on real estate website, Zillow, says.

'And the occasional ghastly visage lurking behind you in the bathroom mirror. Even still, this occurs very rarely and only in the second floor bathroom.'

'Slightly haunted': This possessed 1901 Victorian house at 1217 Marion St house in Dunmore, Pennsylvania (center) is on the market for $144,000

Packed with poltergeists: Gregory Leeson has put his Marion Street, Pennsylvania home on the market for just $144,000 - and he has assured potential buyers it's not so creepy

And it gets creepier. Leeson described occasionally hearing voices in his daughter’s room when she was an infant.

'It
 sounded like there was a person in the room with her talking. We’d go 
in, and she was just sitting there. But she normally cried constantly,' 
he said.

Even though Philadelphia law doesn't require that Leeson disclose a haunting, he decided it would be fair to be upfront. 

And his honesty seems to have paid off. Leeson said he has been inundated with queries since listing the four bedroom property, which was built in 1901, about six days ago.  

'When I was writing it, I had been thinking about it, and I went back and forth,' he told Zillow.

'The way I worded it — I was trying to keep it light. I have been reading online, and people saying you are supposed to disclose it. I don’t know the laws here, but thought better safe than sorry.

'I’ve gotten a lot of offers. I guess any publicity is good publicity. I think it’s helping in the long run. It’s a nice house. If it’s getting it out there and a buyer likes the house, they probably won’t be dissuaded.'

However, 'scientifically minded' Leeson isn’t entirely convinced his 3,367-square-foot home is haunted.

'Doors slam shut, but it’s an old house. 
It’s not that often. I used to have roommates, and my wife’s friend 
swears the house is possessed. I have other friends that come over and 
say it’s the most calming house they’ve been in,' he said.

Buyer beware: The seller says you may find 'the occasional ghastly visage lurking behind you in the bathroom mirror. Even still, this occurs very rarely and only in the second floor bathroom' (pictured)

Eerie: The sounds of phantom footsteps can be heard on the staircase and throughout the haunted house

Although the spine-tingling property is not for the fainthearted, lovers of the paranormal may consider the home a steal.

According to the listing, the spacious home boasts stain-glass windows, a study/library with a secret door behind a moving bookcase which leads into a small office, a large crawl space behind a concealed door hidden in a bedroom closet and a basement with a wet bar.

For some buyers, the supernatural activity may be an added extra.

A recent survey by realtor.com found that more than half of home buyers are open to purchasing a haunted house. About 35 percent of the nearly 1,400 respondents said they have lived in a haunted home.

'When purchasing a home, buyers want to know what they are getting into and that includes anything potentially spooky,' Alison Schwartz, vice president of corporate communications for Move Inc., which operates realtor.com, told NBC News.

'Our data reveals that while the majority of consumers are open to purchasing a haunted home, many buyers conduct research on a home’s history to be aware of any weird incidences.'

But, she added, while some people 'are willing to purchase a haunted home at a discounted price, many say levitating objects, ghost sightings and objects moving from one place to another would deter them from purchasing a home.'

The hand that rocks the cradle: Gregory Leeson's listing has prompted interest from would-be ghost hunters who have no trouble sleeping in a haunted house

While you were sleeping: Leeson said a woman's 'hardly noticeable' scream could be heard at least once a week at about at 3.13am

Only kind of haunted: Leeson has assured potential buyers the house is 'slightly haunted, nothing serious, though'
