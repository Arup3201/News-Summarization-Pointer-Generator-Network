Most people want to ‘end their days’ living in a bungalow, Tory minister Nick Boles has claimed.

The planning minister suggested ‘people love’ single-storey homes, and wants to encourage developers to build more of them.

But he admitted that, because they took up more space, more land would be needed for developments to meet demand.

Retirement: The majority of pensioners would like to 'end their days' in a bungalow, the government's planning minister has claimed

It is thought more single-storey houses would persuade older people to downsize, freeing up more family homes and kick-starting the housing market.

Bungalow account for just one in 50 of all properties across the country, and four years ago just 300 bungalows were built in the UK.

Mr Boles suggested that developments that included bungalows instead of standard houses or apartments could escape opposition from people living nearby.

‘Bungalows, we have built far too few. People love them. Every opinion poll, you ask people where they would like to end their days they all say they all say, not all but a lot of them, that they want to end their days in a bungalow,’ he told the Politicians in Planning Association conference last week.

‘If we’re going to provide for more bungalows we’re going to have to provide more land than we otherwise would.

‘Now some of you will be happy to do that and others will say actually that’s just impossible in our circumstance, and therefore we’re going to create apartment buildings.’

Planning Minister Nick Boles said most people 'love' bungalows and would not object to them being built near them

Ministers have previously been urged to encourage more bungalows to stimulate the housing market

Older people who are reluctant to move out of family homes, even when children have moved away, could be persuaded to downsize to bungalows as a preferred way of living.

Mr Boles added: ‘Bungalows are not a universal panacea, but they are very popular and therefore if you have land in your neighbourhoods and you propose to allocate it specifically to bungalows I think you’ll find that those site allocations are some of the more popular ones that you make.’

In April the Policy Exchange think tank called for planning rules to be torn up to encourage developers to move away from tiny box flats to investing in low level living.

It called for councils to lose control over granting planning permission, instead allowing local people to decide what can and cannot be built in their town or village.

Residents could be more willing to support a wave of new bungalows, because they are less likely to impact on views.

Bungalows were popular in the 1970s, but fell out of fashion as developers rushed to build blocks of flats

The Policy Exchange report added: ‘If thirty per cent of people’s ideal home is a bungalow, and this preference is even stronger for older people, it make no sense to prevent construction of bungalows if we are interested in increasing the housing supply and a more efficient use of the existing housing stock.

‘Older people currently living in large family homes might want to downsize to a bungalow, which is smaller and easier to maintain, as well as being on one floor and offering outside space.

‘There are huge numbers of spare rooms in homes older people are currently living in. What are needed are the homes that older people like and so would like to move into.

‘But planning policy prevents these homes from being built – and this is before we even begin to discuss the fact that higher land prices caused by our planning system would in any case mitigate against building bungalows.’
