The Duchess of Cambridge and  Prince George

The Duchess of Cambridge is preparing to return to work after recovering from three weeks of acute morning sickness.

According to Royal aides, the Duchess is planning to resume official engagements next month, with a spokesman telling The Mail on Sunday: ‘There will be engagements in October and November. We just haven’t announced them yet.’

The Duchess has been suffering from hyperemesis gravidarum – the condition she suffered during her pregnancy with Prince George. Although she has not been admitted to hospital this time, she has received medical assistance at Kensington Palace.

The Duchess’s last official engagement was on August 5 when she opened a poppy installation at the Tower of London with her husband William and Prince Harry.

Over the summer she headed to Belgium for First World War centenary commemorations and was in Yorkshire in July for the start of the Tour de France. But she has not carried out a charitable engagement since July, when went to a North London school to see one of her M-Pact projects, and has told aides she is keen to revisit some of her charities.

Last weekend, the Duchess was forced to pull out of a tour of Malta on behalf of the Queen, leaving Prince William to stand in for her.

Kate was also due to join William at an engagement in Oxford three weeks ago but was too ill – and it was her absence that prompted the Palace to announce her pregnancy prematurely.

Now that she is feeling better, the couple are expected to move into their new ten-bedroom Georgian pile, Anmer Hall, in Norfolk.

‘While they will be predominantly living in Norfolk, the intention is for Kate to hop between London and Norfolk while looking after Prince George,’ said a source.
