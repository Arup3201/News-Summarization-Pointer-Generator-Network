England may have failed on all accounts during the World Cup in Brazil, but that hasn't stopped the FA from selecting a five-man shortlist for their player of the year.

Roy Hodgson's side failed to win a single game in South America as they finished bottom of their World Cup group but the FA have selected five names for supporters to vote for their player of the year.

Wayne Rooney and Joe Hart will be among the favourites to come out on top of the fans' poll with Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain, Phil Jagielka and Jordan Henderson also featuring.

Wayne Rooney celebrates scoring in his most recent England appearance at Scotland and will hope to be named the Three Lions' Player of the Year for a record third time

Joe Hart applauds fans following a goalless draw with Honduras before the World Cup - one of the Manchester City's seven clean sheets at international level in 2014

Frank Lampard (2): 2004, 2005

Steven Gerrard (2): 2007, 2012

Wayne Rooney (2): 2008, 2009

David Beckham: 2003

Owen Hargreaves: 2006

Ashley Cole: 2010 

Scott Parker: 2011 

Rooney played in all 13 of England's games in 2014 and improved during a year which saw him net eight times (including his first ever goal in the World Cup finals), as well as being named the new captain following the international retirement of Steven Gerrard.

The Manchester United striker also reached his 100th cap and is now just three short of Sir Bobby Charlton's 49 goals record for England.

Hart also had a year which saw his place cemented in the international set-up - keeping seven clean sheets across 10 games as he reached 48 caps.

Jordan Henderson, Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain and Phil Jagielka  are also in the running to win the award

Despite being just 27-years-old, Hart is now one of the senior members of the squad following the retirement of Gerrard, Ashley Cole and Frank Lampard.

Barring 2013, the online poll has been running since 2003 and was first won by David Beckham. Rooney is hoping to win the award for a record third time following success in 2008 and 2009.

The FA also have an additional two categories to vote in, with Jack Butland and Steph Houghton among the respective contenders for Under 21 Player of the Year and Women's Player of the Year.
