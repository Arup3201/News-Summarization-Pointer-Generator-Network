Clutching a handful of notes, the Duchess of Cornwall looked delighted after she won a bet against her son at Cheltenham yesterday.

After watching the race intently through binoculars, Camilla broke into a huge grin as 6-4 favourite Faugheen romped to a four-and-a-half length victory.

The Duchess seemed thrilled as she took three £20 notes from Tom Parker-Bowles, who joined her in the Royal Box for Ladies Day, before stuffing them in her handbag.

But her chef son, 39, appeared to be a
 little peeved to have lost out on the wager.

A palace aide said: ‘The 
Duchess was delighted with her win. She’s a great horse lover and enjoys
 coming to Cheltenham. All of her family love racing.’

The Duchess wore a
 brown tweed skirt and coat by Roy Allen, a £220 light brown, fur 
trimmed hat by Lock & Co, and suede boots, as she attended the 
second day of the festival.

Her arrival at the racecourse was delayed by 20 minutes after fog meant her helicopter had to be diverted to a nearby airfield.

She
 was then driven to the course where she walked through the crowds and 
across the parade ring to the Royal Box. Mr Parker-Bowles wrote on 
Twitter: ‘Just arrived at Cheltenham. The greatest sporting event on 
earth.’

Fur and pearls: The Duchess had dressed up like a quintessential English lady

Yesterday's races 
included the RSA Steeplechase, the BetVictor Queen Mother Champion 
Steeplechase and the Weatherbys Champion Bumper.

Camilla's son joined her for a day watching some of the country's best National Hunt jockeys.

The
 Duchess, a keen horse enthusiast, was invited to the races by the 
chairman of Cheltenham racecourse, Robert Waley-Cohen, and later will 
present a trophy to the winner of the BetVictor Queen Mother Champion 
Chase.

Fur, tweed and plenty of pearls also topped 
the style menu for other women as Ladies Day at the Cheltenham Festival in 
Gloucestershire got underway.

For the royal party - which included Princess Anne and new mother Zara Phillips - brown boots seemed to be the order of
 the day. The three women all wore similar styles.

Camilla teamed hers with a brown tweed skirt and coat by Roy Allen and a light brown, fur-trimmed hat by Lock.

Avid
 racegoer Zara Phillips was also in attendance at Cheltenham for the second day 
of the festival, along with her mother Princess Anne and 
sister-in-law Autumn.

While 
other women made the most of the unseasonably warm March day to show 
their legs off in short dresses, the royals wrapped in long coats and 
boots.

New mother Zara 
wore a purple tweed coat, furry stole and mauve hat, while Princess Anne
 wore a long cream coat and striped velvet hat.

Zara was also at the races yesterday along with husband Mike Tindall as the new parents took time off from caring for their two-month-old daughter Mia.

Yesterday, when once spectator 
congratulated Mr Tindall on the birth of their daughter, she quickly 
turned round and quipped: 'Why? He didn't even do anything!'

Perhaps he is trying to rectify this by staying home babysitting today.

Meanwhile, Zara must have been missing her little girl as she passed at one point to admire another baby in a buggy in the VIP area.

While Aintree is famous for its scantily clad racegoers and Royal Ascot for its hats, the Cheltenham Festival has become synonymous with an altogether more rural approach to dressing.

Eschewing
 skyscraper heels and flimsy dresses in favour of elegant wool coats and
 comfortable patent leather boots, the race meeting offers a masterclass
 in country chic, complete with lashings of tweed and even a flat cap or
 two.

Hat and heels: These women brighten up Ladies Day

Country chic: Furs, feathers and tweed were popular apparel

Unlike
 Ascot, organisers at Cheltenham refuse to impose a dress code on guests
 and, beyond exhortations to wrap up warm and avoid anything that might 
offend, say anything goes - up to and including fancy dress.

But
 perhaps a warning isn't required: Although the clothes donned by 
Gloucestershire's most fashionable might be rural, the looks on show 
certainly don't lack glamour with oversized sunglasses, pearl necklaces 
and twinkling diamond stud earrings employed to up the fashion ante.

Fur
 too is a recurring motif, as are hats that take inspiration from rural 
life. Like the stylish effort deployed by Zara Phillips on day one, many
 come festooned in pheasant feathers while elegant blooms are a 
perennial favourite.

Male
 racegoers aren't immune from the pull of country style either, with 
most opting for tweed suits or chic red chinos teamed with a preppy navy
 blazer and artfully knotted tie.

But
 whether girls in pearls and princess coats or preppy chaps in Prince of
 Wales check, the Cheltenham Festival is just as stylish as its 
Berkshire counterpart.
