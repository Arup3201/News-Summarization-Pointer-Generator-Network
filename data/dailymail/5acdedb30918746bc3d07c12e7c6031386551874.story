If you've ever looked in awe at smart skin being developed for robots, don't worry - your own is far more intelligent. 

Neurons in human skin perform advanced calculations scientists previously believed only the brain could carry out, it has been revealed.

Researchers say that in fact our skin passes far more information to the brain that had previously been thought. 

Skin is far more sensitive than we thought, and transmits more information than researchers had previously thought.

Our touch experiences are already processed by neurons in the skin before they reach the brain for further processing.

Researchers found that the skin actually calculates geometric data itself before sending signals to the brain. 

Previously, it has been thought that far more basic information was sent. 

This is according to a study from Umeå University in Sweden published in the journal Nature Neuroscience.

It found that the skin actually calculates geometric data itself before sending signals to the brain.

According to researchers at the Department of Integrative Medical Biology, IMB, Umeå University, this branching allows first-order tactile neurons not only to send signals to the brain that something has touched the skin, but also process geometric data about the object touching the skin.

'Our work has shown that two types of first-order tactile neurons that supply the sensitive skin at our fingertips not only signal information about when and how intensely an object is touched, but also information about the touched object's shape,' said Andrew Pruszynski, who is one of the researchers behind the study.

Researchers found that the skin actually calculates geometric data itself before sending signals to the brain.

The study also shows that the sensitivity of individual neurons to the shape of an object depends on the layout of the neuron’s highly-sensitive zones in the skin.

'Perhaps the most surprising result of our study is that these peripheral neurons, which are engaged when a fingertip examines an object, perform the same type of calculations done by neurons in the cerebral cortex,' Pruszynski said.

'Somewhat simplified, it means that our touch experiences are already processed by neurons in the skin before they reach the brain for further processing/'
