Self-titled Welfare Queen Marie Buchan has once again fanned the flames of anger over her right to claim benefits to support her eight children.

The 33-year-old, of Selly Oak in Birmingham, who lives in a council house and receives handouts of £26,000 a year, appeared on today's This Morning to feature in a debate on the government's proposed cap on benefits.

In last week's Daily Mail, she said a cap at £23,000 would leave her and her young family struggling to survive. She appeared on the ITV show today to further argue her case.

The pair debated on today's This Morning prompting floods of comments from viewers

Mother-of-eight Marie said she would struggle to hold down a job whilst caring for her brood but Julia, right, said she should have thought about that before she had them

She said: 'I'd be lost without benefits. I didn't chose to be left on my own. I use the money to raise my eight children, they will go to school and university and hopefully get jobs to put back into system.'

Marie, who has been on benefits since she was 19, said she is 'eager' to work but she has struggled to find a job she can fit in around her commitments as a single mother.

'There's eight children, they could go to after school club and breakfast club but if they are ill what do I do?' she said.

'I did get a job but as I struggled to get them all ready in morning, I had to call and tell them I couldn't attend,' she said.

'I tried for another job working 16 hours a week but they said no as my face is known from the papers. I am eager to work, I would be a cleaner. I have an appointment at the job centre tomorrow.' 

Marie cares for Tia, 12, Leah, 11, Latoya, nine, Joshua, eight, Alisha, six, Mikayla, four, Amelia, two, and Olivia, one, on her own after she split up with their father.

She said he's 'a working man' who only sees his children at weekends. 

Broadcaster Julia Hartley-Brewer, who appeared on the ITV show to debate with Marie, asked her why she carried on having children when she knew she couldn't support them.

The 46-year-old from London, who is married with an eight-year-old daughter, said: 'It's your sense of entitlement that makes people angry. You made a choice to have eight children.'

She accused Marie of abusing the welfare system. 

'Most mothers work whether they are single or married because it's the right thing to do, the only way we can afford welfare is because people work,' she argued.

'You are bright and in good health, you have a moral duty to work,' she told Marie.

'How can you expect to live the life you want and expect everyone else to pay for it? You're telling everyone we are mugs for going to work. Why don't we all not work and get benefits?'

Julia said Marie has no excuse not to work as there are thousands of jobs for cleaners available and many other single mothers manage to get their children organised so they can hold down a position. 

'Others struggle to make ends meet to help people like you, many on minimum wage,' she said. 'We have made it possible for you to have this situation.'

Hundreds of viewers contacted the show to join in the debate. 

Lauren Wright wrote on the This Morning Facebook page: 'If you can't afford to have eight children don't have eight children. Why should I pay to help you bring up your children when I'm working hard to look after my own rather than scrounging??'

The family live in a council house and Marie admits they'd 'be lost' without benefits

Becci Jones agreed. She wrote: 'I work long shifts, weekends and pick up no where near £2,000 a month. If you want children then why should the tax payers pick up your bill!'

Caroline Martin added: 'I'm a single mum and have worked since my little boy was eight months. I only get working tax and child tax credits. This pays for nursery fees only. I get no other support from the state. Make me angry as I'd like to be at home with my little boy but I know that I am giving him the best role model I can be.'

But others rushed to defend Marie saying they felt sorry for her.

Beccy Wheeler said: 'If you think life is better on benefits. Quit your jobs and try it.'

It's not the first time Marie has caused controversy by making a TV appearance to air her views on her right to live off benefits.

In December, she appeared on Channel 5 show Benefits Britain: Life On The Dole where she admitted she was showering her children with Christmas gifts rather than using her benefits money to pay the rent.

She defiantly said: 'A lot of people will see this and once they are all wrapped think "how dare she, she's on benefits and she has all these presents for her kids and we only have two or three for ours because we are working full time and can't afford it".

'But everyone deserves a Christmas and why should we on benefits not be able to? For my children not to be able to open a present on Christmas day because we're on benefits, it's just not right, there shouldn't be a stigma for that.' 

She added: 'If I go back to work doing 12 hours a day it would be positive as I would be at work but the effect on the kids - they would have to go to breakfast club before school, after school club and then not know when I will be home.

'So is it better to work and neglect the kids or be a stay at home mum till the benefits stop?'

On today's This Morning, Marie said she believed her children won't grow up to be on benefits like her because she doesn't think the welfare system will exist in the future as it does now. 

She admitted she has made a rod for her own back being so brazen about her right to benefits in the press and on TV. 

'I do regret it contacting a paper in the first place,' she said.
