They came from every generation and faith. But in bright Bank Holiday sunshine they united to pay their respects.

From the closest of relatives to complete strangers, thousands have visited the makeshift shrine near Woolwich Barracks, marking the scene where Drummer Lee Rigby was killed by cleaver-wielding fanatics last Wednesday.

His killers said they were acting in the name of Allah – but yesterday Muslims bowed their heads in prayer to honour the victim’s memory, and reject the vile hatred of those who butchered him in broad daylight.

Flowers for a hero: The floral tributes laid out for Drummer Lee Rigby outside Woolwich Barracks in South London

Dramatic: Flower tributes run the length of the street outside Woolwich Barracks in south-east London, all to remember the life of Drummer Lee Rigby.

The corner of John Wilson Street and Artillery Place, last week stained 
with blood, is now covered with moving messages for Drummer Rigby and 
his family.

Local shops sold out of flowers as the sea of tributes swelled to 150 
metres wide, in a scene that reminded some of Kensington Gardens after 
the death of Princess Diana. 

Jenny Abbott, 30, from Manchester, just a few miles from the Rigbys’ 
family home in Middleton, Rochdale, said: ‘Lee was from Manchester like 
me and it’s the least I could do for him – come here to lay some 
flowers.

‘To be killed like that, just for being a soldier, is sickening. I can’t get my head around it.’

Biker Dave Murphy rode with 60 of his friends from Kent to Woolwich, 
bringing a Help For Heroes flag to leave at the scene. ‘He was one of 
us,’ he said.

‘He was one of the boys and we want to pay our respects.’

Sharon Wilson, 51, from Grays in Essex, placed flowers. ‘It is such a waste of life and I just feel so sad,’ she said.

‘Being here today with all these other people who wanted to pay their respects is really moving.’

Mother-of-one Suzy Jaworska, 39, a teaching assistant from Maidstone, Kent, said: ‘I just had to come and I’m glad I did.

‘I feel sick this has happened – that one of our soldiers was killed in 
this way. The men who did this are not human. I keep welling up reading 
the poems and letters left by different people who didn’t even know Lee.
 It’s incredibly moving.’

Overcome: A young woman (left) dabs tears from her eyes as she lays flowers at the emotionally-charged site. Some of the bikers wore Help for Heroes t-shirts, similar to the one worn by the murdered soldier

In a statement last week Drummer Rigby’s family thanked the public ‘for 
the amazing support’ and ‘goodwill wishes we are receiving from all over
 the country’. The soldier, who served with the 2nd Battalion the Royal 
Regiment of Fusiliers, had survived Taliban bombs and bullets during a 
gruelling tour of duty of Afghanistan in 2009.

Tragically, in what his 
family had assumed to be the safety of his homeland, he was run over and
 hacked to death by Al Qaeda-inspired extremists near his military base.

Drummer Rigby’s mother Lyn, 46 and stepfather Ian, 54, were among relatives who placed flowers at the shrine on Sunday.

His widow Rebecca, 30, broke down in tears as she placed a large silver 
balloon bearing the words ‘Dad in a million’ on behalf of their 
two-year-old son Jack.

Mrs Rigby, from whom he was estranged, left a message reading: ‘My hero,
 my soldier, my one true love. Until we meet again my angel I know 
you’ll be watching over me and Jack. Love always xxx.’

The soldier’s fiancee, army colleague Aimee West, 22, visited Woolwich 
on Saturday, having flown back from Helmand where she was serving with 
the Royal Military Police.

She wept as she set down a bouquet of roses, with a message addressed to ‘the one I love’.

It continued: ‘My gorgeous wonderful loving fiance, you will always have
 my heart and I know you will always be my guardian angel watching over 
me. Rest in peace baby. All my love for ever and ever, your Princess 
xxxx.’
