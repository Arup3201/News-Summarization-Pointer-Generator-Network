They spent the better part of a day soaking up the sun at a Sydney bar, but after their epic Super 15 rugby title win who could blame them?

Players from the winning Waratah's side were out in force at Bondi Beach on Sunday as they lapped up their 33-32 win from the night before.

The all-day drinking session saw a number of teammates crowd the Bucket List bar as they kicked back and toasted their long-awaited win.

The Waratahs beat New Zealand's Canterbury Crusaders with a last-minute penalty at ANZ Stadium in front of their home crowd.

Bernard Foley scored the long-range three-point penalty to win the match 33-32 for the Waratahs to take out the Super Rugby Championships for the first time in 19 years.

It was a case of third time lucky for the Blues, who have been losing finalists twice before.

Just minutes after the final whistle, the thrilling win prompted fireworks to erupt over the Opera House.

The final was an awesome treat for the almost 62,000 fans - a Super Rugby all-time record - and the biggest crowd for a NSW home game in more than a century.

Blues fans were holding their breath as the Waratahs were on the brink of a third painful finals defeat when the team squandered an early 14-point lead.

But Foley’s 23-point contribution from a conversion and seven penalties and a two-try effort from veteran centre and man of the match Adam Ashley-Cooper proved just enough to deny the seven-time champions from Christchurch.

The Crusaders paid the ultimate price for flanker Richie McCaw's ruck infringement which paved the way for Foley to  kick the winning goal with just seconds left on the clock.

The man of the moment - Foley - said he had been working on his long kicks and gave it everything to get the ball between the posts from near the halfway line.

‘You just step up and take responsibility when it occurs,’ he said. ‘ It’s a dream come true.’

Ashley-Cooper has waited 10 years and 125 games to snare his first finals victory.

'I’ve waited a long time for this,’ he said. ‘It doesn’t get much better. We got the simple things right and got the job done.’

‘I’m absolutely stoked. The nerves are still running through me – its’ like I'm still playing the second half,’ he said after game.

Waratahs captain Michael Cooper was elated straight after the match, describing the win as an 'awesome effort' by all 35 players over the past five weeks of the championship.

'I'm so proud and we are going to enjoy the celebrations and then regroup in the change rooms,' he said. ' I thought the goal went under and not over.'

Cooper described the Crusaders as a 'class outfit'.

'We did a good job to beat a team like that,' he said.
