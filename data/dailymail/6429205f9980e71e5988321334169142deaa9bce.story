Three-time Masters champion Phil Mickelson and Carl Icahn - the richest man on Wall Street - are being investigated by the FBI over claims of insider trading involving them and legendary Las Vegas gambler William Walters.

The FBI is looking into whether Mickelson and Walters may have traded illegally on private information provided by Icahn about his investments in public corporations.

Mickelson, who is currently some way off the pace in at Memorial Tournament in the US, has won five majors as well as 42 events on the PGA Tour, is estimated to be worth $180million.

The investigation into the trio centers 
on what were described as suspicious trades in Clorox Co options days before Icahn announced a 
bid to acquire the company in 2011.

The joint FBI and Securities and Exchange Commission inquiry is the latest case to emerge from a 
multi-year crackdown on insider trading by U.S. authorities.

It involves
 two of the highest-profile personalities in finance and sport: famously
 combative activist investor Icahn and multiple Masters champion 
Mickelson.

Walters, who plays golf with Mickelson, is a well-known sports gambler who met Icahn through a mutual acquaintance and struck up a friendship, according to Reuters.

Sources who have been briefed on the investigation claimed that Icahn had accumulated a 9.1 percent stake in Clorox in February 2011.

In July, the activist investor made an offer for the company that valued it at above $10 billion and sent its stock soaring.

Mickelson and Walters made their Clorox trades as Icahn was mounting his takeover bid for the company, which later failed, according to International Business Times.

It is not known if Mickelson, who has won five major golfing championships, knows Icahn.

The 78-year-old investor, with an estimated wealth of $23 billion, would not have been breaking any laws if he revealed details of his takeover bid, unless it was in breach of confidentiality with his investors.

Investigators were also looking into trades that Mickelson and Walters made related to Dean Foods Co, the unidentified sources claimed.

Icahn, Mickelson and Walters were not immediately available for comment. Spokesmen for the FBI and SEC declined to comment.

None of the men have been accused of wrongdoing in the investigation, which started two years ago.
