The White House has said that President Barack Obama will not jettison Vice-President Joe Biden and replace him with Hillary Clinton as his 2012 running mate.

Republicans such as Senator John McCain and Governor Sarah Palin had suggested Biden be replaced by Clinton after the furore over Biden’s comments to an audience containing many blacks that Republicans intended to ‘put y’all back in chains’.

Asked whether Biden would definitely 
be on the ticket, Jay Carney, White House spokesman, said: ‘Yes.  And 
that was settled a long, long time ago. 

‘And while I appreciate, I have great
admiration for and respect for and a long relationship with Senator 
John McCain, but one place I would not go for advice on 
Vice-Presidential running mates is to Senator McCain.’

Lost your appetite, Joe? President Obama and his VP had lunch today following Biden's inflammatory comments to a black audience earlier this week

Obama had a White House meeting with 
Biden followed by a joint meeting between the two men and Clinton. The 
President and Vice-President then had lunch together, during which 
recent campaign events were discussed.  

Ahead of the meeting the Obama camp said the President would be 'talking to him a 
whole lot about the campaign'.

The Vice-President’s lunch with the 
President is a regularly scheduled event but you can be sure that Biden was expecting to be taken to the woodshed by Obama, who was forced to 
defend his hapless veep in interviews with People magazine and 
Entertainment Tonight.

He 
told People: 'Joe Biden has been an outstanding vice president. He is 
passionate about what's happening in middle-class families. So I will be
talking to him a whole lot about the campaign generally.'

Breaking the ice? Secretary of State Hillary Clinton was set to meet with Obama and Biden before their lunch today

He told Entertainment Tonight that Biden's 'phrasing is a distraction' - a clear sign of his dismay about his Vice-President's loose lips.

'What Joe Biden was talking about again is an example of a substantive argument - a substantive issue, that the American people should be concerned about — and his phrasing is a distraction from what is at stake.'

He added: 'In no sense was he trying to connote something other than that.' When a president is forced to explain what his veep was 'trying to connote', you know things between them are unlikely to be all warm and fuzzy.

Right at the start of his presidency, Obama made clear that he did not appreciate Biden's garrulous jocularity. When Biden joked about Chief Justice John Roberts's mistake in administering the inauguration oath of office, a stony-faced Obama was distinctly unamused.

Obama held a meeting with Biden at 10.15 this morning followed by a session in which they were joined by Hillary Clinton, U.S. Secretary of State. President and veep are then due to have lunch together at 12.30pm.

Speculation that this could be a sign 
that Clinton will replace Biden on the 2012 ticket is highly unlikely to
be anything beyond mischief-making and excessive optimism among 
Republicans.

Although, Obama
still has until the convention in Charlotte to change his running mate,
to ditch Biden at this point would be such a sign of panic and 
desperation that the president would in all likelihood plummet in the 
polls.

Clinton, who could 
well be the Democratic front runner in 2016 whether Obama is re-elected 
or not, would be highly unlikely to want to take Biden's spot.

If an Obama-Clinton ticket lost, the 
former First Lady would be in a worse position than she is now to secure
the 2016 nomination.

Even
if the ticket won and she became veep - often a strong position from 
which to win the White House - her association with Obama could be a 
political millstone by in four years’ time.

Vice-president
Joe Biden controversially told an audience made up of several hundred 
black supporters that Mitt Romney would put 'y'all back in chains' with 
his Wall Street financial deregulation plans.

The
comments were made to an audience of 800 at the Institute for Advanced 
Learning and Research in Danville, Virginia on Monday.
