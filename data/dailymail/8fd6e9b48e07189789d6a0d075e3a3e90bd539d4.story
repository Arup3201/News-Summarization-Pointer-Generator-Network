Accused: Lostprophets singer Ian Watkins (pictured) denied raping a baby when he appeared via video link at Cardiff Crown Court today

Rock singer Ian Watkins appeared in court today to deny almost two dozen sex offence charges including two of raping a baby.

The frontman for rock band Lostprophets appeared before Cardiff Crown Court, south Wales, in a plea hearing via video-link.

Two women, aged 20 and 24, also denied sexual offences against children.

Both appeared via video-link. Neither can be named for legal reasons.

Watkins, 35, of Pontypridd, south Wales, denied 23 separate charges, among them for the first time two allegations he raped a baby, aged one at the time.

One of the two women allegedly involved is accused of aiding and abetting him to carry it out.

Watkins, whose band has sold more than 3.5 million albums worldwide, is also accused of aiding and abetting the sexual assault of a child.

He also faces a series of charges for possessing, making and distributing indecent images of children.

He is also accused of possessing extreme images depicting a person having sex with an animal.

The oldest of the alleged offences dates back to 2007.

The clerk in court today confirmed after the hearing that Watkins had pleaded not guilty to all charges.

She confirmed that he appeared via video-link from where he is being held in custody at Parc Prison, Bridgend.

She added that both he and the two women are collectively accused of a total of 32 offences. All three deny all the charges.

Recorder of Cardiff judge Eleri Rees adjourned proceedings until Thursday for a case management hearing at the same court.

Legal teams from all sides are expected by then to know the availability of expert witnesses integral to their cases.

Judge Rees is expected to be able to set a date for the eventual trial of Watkins and the two women.
All three remain remanded in custody.

Tattooed Watkins formed Lostprophets in 1997 with friends from the small former mining town of Pontypridd.

The band were at the forefront of the popular 'Nu Metal' sound and attracted thousands of teenage fans.

Debut album The Fake Sound of Progress achieved Platinum status selling more than 300,000 copies.

Lead single Rooftops got to eight in the UK charts, their joint best performance with Last Train.
