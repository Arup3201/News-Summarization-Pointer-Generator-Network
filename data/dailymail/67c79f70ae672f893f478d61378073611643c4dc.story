A Hawaii island oral and cosmetic surgeon with 27 formal complaints - including a man's death and a woman in a coma - is no longer allowed to practice in the state.

Dr. John Stover voluntarily revoked his license and agreed not to be involved in any medical or dental procedures in Hawaii ever again.

The Hawaii Medical Board voted to accept the settlement.

Banned: Dr. John Stover has had 27 complaints filed against him in Hawaii - including complaints for the deaths of two people

Voluntary: Stover voluntarily turned over his licenses and agreed to not conduct any medical or dental procedures - the vote just made it official

'The vote was seven in favor with one abstention,' Hawaii Medical Board Chairman Dr. Danny Takanishi, Jr., told Hawaii News Now.

Meanwhile, former patient Kristen Tavares remains in a coma after a wisdom teeth extraction. Her father, Joe Tavares, said he's glad Stover won't work in Hawaii again.

Another complaint against Stover involves the death of Curtis Wagasky.

Wagasky, 52 at the time, was a homeless, disabled veteran who died three days after he went to Stover to have one tooth removed in December of 2012.

An investigation conducted by HNN revealed that Wagasky had no serious previous medical problems before he went to Stover to have his tooth pulled.

Victim: Homeless military veteran Curtis Wagasky went to Stover to have one tooth pulled - he died three days later

Stover wrote in his report that Wagasky had become uncooperative, so he gave him an additional sedative.

HNN says a former staff member in Stover's office claims that Stover knew Wagasky should not have been given the additional sedative - but he did it anyway.

Wagasky died three days later - and because he had no family advocating for him, his death went univestigated; no autopsy was performed and there was no police report. 

Even though Stover closed his three offices on the Big Island last month, patients can still file legal actions against him.

State Department of Commerce and Consumer Affairs spokes­man Brent Suyama said it will be difficult for Stover to obtain a license anywhere else.

The license revocation will go into a national registry.

'I would hope some people may take comfort in the fact that he is unable to practice any longer,' Suyama said. 'If something happens to your family members or yourself, I think it's difficult to feel any vindication in the regards. However, this does end this licensee's practice.'

Stover also will have his revocation entered into a national registry, which will make it incredibly difficult for him to practice anywhere in the U.S.
