Police searching for missing Alice Gross drained a stretch of a canal yesterday in the hunt for her missing possessions.

Officers spent hours sifting through mud and debris after receiving ‘specific intelligence’ that some of her belongings could be found there.

They are desperate to recover the 14-year-old’s iPhone, which lost its signal an hour before she was due home.

Looking: The police and fire brigade search the Hanwell Locks area of the Grand Union Canal in west London today, which has been drained as part of the hunt for Alice

Muddy work: Officers think Alice's missing smartphone may hold 'key' information about her disappearance

Careful search: Alice, 14, is white, 5ft 2ins tall, of very slim build and has shoulder-length, light brown hair

Looking closely: A couple came forward earlier this month to tell police they saw Alice's bag at around 8.15pm on the day she went missing

In a line: Alice, who was being treated for anorexia, was last seen on CCTV at around 4.30pm on August 28

Police continue to search for the missing schoolgirl who disappeared on August 28 in the largest deployment of police resources since the 7/7 bombings

The Metropolitan Police yesterday searched a wasteland between river Brent and Elthorne Park near Trumpers Way, Hanwell, where Alice was last seen

Officers are now considering footage from around 300 CCTV cameras as the hunt for missing Alice continues

Two officers search a section of the river Brent as the hunt for 14-year-old Alice Gross enters its fifth week 

The operation is the largest use of police resources since the 7/7 bombings, a Scotland Yard source said

The move came as the sister of prime suspect Arnis Zalkalns, 41, said
 he could use his military training to live rough for weeks. The jobbing
 builder has not been seen since Alice’s disappearance grabbed headlines
 nationwide.

Dozens of officers spent the weekend scouring the 
open land around where Alice was last seen alive, with RAF aircraft 
carrying high-definition cameras and thermal imaging equipment overhead.

More
 than a month since Alice vanished police took the dramatic step of 
draining a 200-yard stretch of the Grand Union Canal, near her home in 
Hanwell, west London. They are desperately trying to find clues as to 
the fate of the schoolgirl and the location of the man suspected of 
playing a role in her disappearance.

Zalkalns, who lived in Ealing
 with his girlfriend and their baby daughter, went missing himself seven
 days later. He was captured on the same CCTV camera as Alice, cycling 
in the same direction.

Scotland Yard said officers had been overwhelmed by the support given by the community to try to find the girl

A Metropolitan Police spokesman said so far the search had involved underwater and confined space experts

But his location remains a mystery – he 
does not have his passport and has not used his mobile phone or accessed
 his bank account.

A businessman said police missed the chance to 
view his CCTV footage because it is stored for only 13 days. David 
O’Neil, director of Contrast UK Shopfront Shutters, which is near where 
Alice was last seen, said it was a ‘cock-up’.

Zalkalns was jailed 
for seven years in Latvia after stabbing his 22-year-old wife Rudite in 
the heart and burying her body more than 17 years ago.

The killer 
even managed to convince police and his wife’s family that she was 
missing when he had in fact lured her to her death.

Zalkalns’ 
statement reveals he made a knife to kill his wife and hid it in a 
remote forest. ‘I took her to a place in the forest that I knew,’ he 
wrote. ‘I asked her to wait and went to get the metal bar and the knife.

‘I
 took the metal bar and beat her a few times on the head. She fell down 
on her back and I got the knife. Then I cut her clothes and then ... I 
stabbed her once in the heart.’

Detective Superintendent Carla Mentha said police were still appealing to members of the public for any information about the girl 

Alice Gross has been missing since August 28 when she was last seen crossing the towpath in west London

His sister, Jolanta Daksa, said 
Zalkalns – a former member of the Latvian home guard – is ‘more than 
capable of surviving outdoors for weeks’.

She said he had been 
consumed by guilt after killing his wife and would have contacted his 
family to tell them he had not harmed Alice. ‘I think he has killed 
himself,’ she added.

Police are still working through 150 tip-offs
 they received after staging a reconstruction of Alice’s disappearance 
last week and reviewing material from 300 CCTV cameras.

Police said CCTV had played a crucial role in the search for Alice Gross who went missing more than four weeks ago. She was last seen crossing a towpath at Grand Union Canal in west London on August 28

Alice's parents Jose Gross and Rosalind Hodgekiss issued an emotional appeal for their daughter to return home
