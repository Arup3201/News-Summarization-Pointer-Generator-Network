One non-league fan at Nantwich Town got more than he bargained for when he attended the Cheshire club's clash with FC United of Manchester. 

The elderly supporter answered a desperate PA announcement for a qualified official to run the line after the referee picked up an injury just nine minutes into the Northern Premier League match.   

Wearing a jacket and trousers, he took the flag after the original linesman stepped into the referee's shoes.

FC United's official Twitter account tweeted a picture with the caption: 'Here's the new linesman in his Harrington jacket and trousers. Plucked from obscurity in the crowd.' 

And the fans also got in on the banter, with Dave Ashurst tweeting: 'Pensioners running the line whatever text, might give it a try.'

FC United won the Northern Premier League match 2-1 with goals from Tom Greaves and Tom Brown.
