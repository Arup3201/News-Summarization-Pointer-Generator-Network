Hostess Brands and its striking union have agreed to mediation talks to try and resolve their differences, meaning the Texas-based baker of Ho Hos, Twinkies and Wonder Bread isn't going out of business just yet.

The news came Monday after Hostess moved to liquidate and sell off its assets in bankruptcy court citing a crippling strike last week.

The bankruptcy judge hearing the case said Monday that the parties haven't gone through the critical step of mediation and asked the lawyer for the Bakery, Confectionery, Tobacco Workers and Grain Millers International Union, which has been on strike since November 9, to ask his client, who wasn't present, if the union would agree to participate.

Twenty four hours to save Twinkies: Producer Hostess Brands and unions have agreed to mediation talks

Within hours of Friday's announcement that Hostess was going out of business, there was a rush on buying their products

The judge noted that the bakery union, which represents about 30 percent of Hostess workers, went on strike after rejecting the company's latest contract offer, even though it had never filed an objection to it.

‘Many people, myself included, have serious questions as to the logic behind this strike,’ said Judge Robert Drain, who heard the case in the U.S. Bankruptcy Court in the Southern District of New York in White Plains, N.Y.

‘Not to have gone through that step leaves a huge question mark in this case.’

Monday's hearing had been expected to
 be the first step towards Hostess selling its well-known brands such as
 Twinkies, Wonder Bread, Ding Dongs and Ho Hos.

But the hearing was quickly adjourned until Wednesday as the judge urged the parties to hold private talks to find a solution.

Hostess and the union agreed to the mediation talks, which are expected to begin on Tuesday.

In an interview after the hearing on Monday, CEO Gregory Rayburn said that the two parties will have to agree to contract terms within 24 hours of the Tuesday meeting since it is costing $1 million a day in overhead costs to wind down operations. But even if a contract agreement is reached, it is not clear if all 33 Hostess plants will go back to being operational.

‘We didn't think we had a runway, but the judge just created a 24-hour runway,’ for the two parties to come to an agreement, Rayburn said.

Shortage: Hostress Brands quickly sold out after news spread that the company was going out of business

Hostess Brands and its striking union have agreed to mediation talks after an intervention by a bankruptcy judge

Hostess, weighed down by debt, management turmoil, rising labor costs and the changing tastes of America, decided on Friday that it no longer could make it through a conventional Chapter 11 bankruptcy restructuring.

Instead, the company, which is based in Irving, Texas, asked the court for permission to sell assets and go out of business.

It's not the sequence of events that the maker of Twinkies, Ding Dongs and Ho Ho's envisioned when it filed for bankruptcy in January, its second Chapter 11 filing in less than a decade.

The company, who said that it was saddled with costs related to its unionized workforce, had hoped to emerge with stronger financials. It brought on Rayburn as a restructuring expert and was working to renegotiate its contract with labor unions.

But Rayburn wasn't able to reach a deal with the bakery union. The company, which had been contributing $100 million a year in pension costs for workers, offered workers a new contract that would've slashed that to $25 million a year, in addition to wage cuts and a 17 percent reduction in health benefits. But the bakery union decided to strike.

By that time, the company had reached a contract agreement with its largest union, the International Brotherhood of Teamsters, which urged the bakery union to hold a secret ballot on whether to continue striking. Although many bakery workers decided to cross picket lines this week, Hostess said it wasn't enough to keep operations at normal levels.

Rayburn said that Hostess was already operating on razor thin margins and that the strike was the final blow. The company's announcement on Friday that it would move to liquidate prompted people across the country to rush to stores and stock up on their favorite Hostess treats.

Many businesses reported selling out of Twinkies within hours and the spongy yellow cakes turned up for sale online for hundreds of dollars.

Even if Hostess goes out of business, its popular brands will likely find a second life after being snapped up by buyers. The company says several potential buyers have expressed interest in the brands.

Although Hostess' sales have been declining in recent years, the company still does about $2.5 billion in business each year. Twinkies alone has brought in $68 million so far this year.

The
 quintessential junk food treat - a cream-filled, 150-calorie sponge 
cake - has been called the 'cream puff of the proletariat' and the 'snack with a snack in the middle.' It had faced extinction after its 
maker, Hostess Brands, announced plans to liquidate amid a dispute with 
striking bakers.* James A. Dewar, a manager for the 
Continental Baking Co, came up with the idea in 1930 after seeing the 
machines that made shortcakes with strawberry filling sit idle at the 
bakery when strawberries were out of season. He injected the elongated 
sponge cake with banana filling - vanilla would be used later - and 
called it a Twinkie after seeing a billboard for the Twinkle Toe Shoe 
Company. Dewar, who died in 1985 at age 88, said he ate at least two 
packets of Twinkies a week.* 
Twinkies were scorned by nutritionists as the archetypal unhealthy snack
 and became a comic's punch line, but somebody was eating them. Hostess 
was able to manufacture 1,000 a minute at its bakeries and in 2005 the 
Washington Post said Americans had bought $47 million worth of Twinkies 
in the previous year.* Many jokes about Twinkies play off
 their longevity thanks to their ample chemical preservatives. There has
 been much speculation about how many decades a Twinkie can sit on a 
shelf before being eaten. For the sake of freshness, Theresa Cogswell of
 the Twinkies' parent company Hostess, has said that no more than 25 
days was ideal but a Maine college professor gained notoriety by keeping
 one atop his blackboard for 30 years. He said it still looked good.*
 In 2000 President Bill Clinton's White House Millennium Council put 
together a time capsule in order to give people in 2100 an idea of how 
we lived. Its contents included historic items such as a piece of the 
Berlin Wall, film of Neil Armstrong walking on the moon, a U.S. World 
War Two soldier's helmet, a photo of civil rights pioneer Rosa Parks and
 a Twinkie.* The trial of San Francisco city supervisor 
Dan White, who fatally shot the mayor and another supervisor in 1978, 
gave rise to what came to be known as the 'Twinkie defense.' The defense
 said White was suffering mental problems, as evidenced by the way he 
had given up his healthy lifestyle and started eating junk food. The 
defense argued that this behavior was an indication of his instability. 
White ended up serving five years in prison for voluntary manslaughter.*
 Twinkies' surge in popularity in the 1950s was partially attributed to 
its ads on 'The Howdy Doody Show' directed at kids, who demanded the 
desserts in their lunch boxes.* Hostess collected recipes
 from connoisseurs to publish the 'The Twinkies Cookbook' in 2006. The 
50 recipes included Twinkie-based burritos, lasagna, tiramisu, 
milkshakes and sushi (with dried fruit rather than fish). Deep-fried 
Twinkies have been a staple at U.S. state fairs.*
 The Twinkie has a long list of television and movie credits. Archie 
Bunker always had one in his lunch on the sitcom 'All in the Family' and
 they have been featured in the animated series 'Family Guy' and 'The 
Simpsons.' A character in 'The Deer Hunter' eats Twinkies dipped in 
mustard. In the wacky comedy 'Ghostbusters' a scientist tracking demons 
calculates that the level of 'psychokinetic energy' in New York City 
could normally be as big as a Twinkie but things had become so bad that 
that Twinkie would now be 35 feet long and weigh 600 pounds (about 270 
kg).* Twinkies are just part of the Hostess snack food 
family. Other well-known treats from the company include Ding Dongs, Ho 
Hos, Suzy Q's, Sno Balls, Zingers and Drake's cakes.*
 Twitter and other social media were filled with laments about a 
Twinkie-less world on Friday. Entrepreneurs and speculators turned to 
eBay. A box of 10 Twinkies was being offered on the online auction site 
for a starting bid of $500. 'What better way to say, "I love you" than 
with the gift of an American icon that will be gone soon,' the seller 
said.
