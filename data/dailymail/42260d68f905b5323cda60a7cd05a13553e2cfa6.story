Windfall: Walter Samasko Jr., who died with only $200 in his checking account, had at least $7million of coins in his Nevada home

When 69-year-old Walter Samasko Jr died in May he left behind just $200 in the bank and no friends or family to lay claim to the meager inheritance. 

He hadn't worked since 1968 and was living off stock accounts of $140,000 and $25,000.

But the real treasure was found at his Nevada home, along with his decaying body, one month later after neighbours complained of a foul smell.

There officials discovered box upon box of gold coins and bars stowed away in Samasko's garage, valued at a staggering $7million or more.

The 69-year-old had died from heart problems, a coroner found, at least one month before he was discovered.

Leaving no will, and with no known relatives, officials set about tracking down a list of people who had attended Samasko's mother's funeral after she died in 1992, the Las Vegas Sun reported.

They managed to identify a first cousin, Arlene Magdanz, a substitute teacher living in San Rafael, California.

Though Ms Magdanz declined to comment, her attorney said that the first words of of his client's mouth were: 'Oh my God, oh my God.'

Quiet life: The reclusive millionaire lived in this modest ranch home and kept his coins in his attached garage

Everything's golden: Among the coins Mr Samasko collected were Austrian ducats, left, and South African Krugerrands, right, many dating from the late 1800s and early 1900s

Stockpiling: Officials said that much of Mr Samanko's wealth was from $20 gold coins from the U.S. (stock photo)

Royal find: He also had a collection of British sovereign coins that depicted Queen Victoria, in both her earlier and later years on the throne (stock photo)

She had not spoken to her cousin for a year.

The gold, including 
coins from Mexico, England, Austria and South Africa dating to 1872, was
hauled from the garage using a wheelbarrow and truck, then deposited for 
safekeeping.

Carson City Clerk Recorder Alan Glover told MailOnline that only coins were found in Mr Samasko’s house.

‘There were no bars at all. There were all sorts of coins, though – Mexican, British sovereigns, Austrian ducats, (South African) krugerrands, most of it was U.S. $20 gold pieces.’

The British sovereign coins, he said, had ‘both early and later Queen Victoria – from 1840s and the 1890s.’

He added that the county clerk’s office is in the process of recruiting Mr Howard Herz, a locally renowned jeweller, to appraise the coins for internal revenue. Mr Herz’s family has owned a jewellery store in the area for more than 130 years.

Mr Glover told MailOnline that the $7million appraisal was ‘just on what we think the gold weight of it,’ meaning that the actual value of the coinage could very well be worth much more.

‘A lot of them were just bulk coins wrapped in aluminium foil,’ he said, adding that it may be some time until the world really knows Mr Samasko’s wealth. ‘No idea how long the appraisal will take,’ he said.

Mr Glover said that Mr Samasko’s mother was the one who began collecting coins, a tradition that he continued after she died. ‘They were most likely taking money out of their stock accounts and buying gold with it,’ Mr Glover said.

Gold rush: His cousin, Arlene Magdanz, will likely inherit the entire coin collection, though she hasn't had contact with him in more than a year

Other things 
found in the 'anti-government' pensioner's home included a stash of 
conspiracy theory books and several guns, Mr Glover 
said.

He rarely went out and never went to a doctor, Mr Glover said. 'He was obsessed with getting diseases from shots.'

Samasko
had lived in the house since the 1960s. Records show that he hadn't 
held down a steady job since 1968. His mother also lived there until her
death in 1992.

And cases like this are rare within Carson City. ‘I’ve never had a case like this, and not in this amount,’ Mr Glover said, adding thoughtfully: ‘(Mr Samasko) had some definite survival tendencies.’

As for his first cousin Ms Magdanz? ‘She has disconnected her telephone,’ Mr Glover said, adding that his office will likely try mailing her to get in contact about her new estate.

‘It’s kind of like winning the lottery,’ he said.
