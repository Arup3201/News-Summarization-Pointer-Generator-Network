Relive Sportsmail's coverage of the Champions League as Arsenal travelled to Istanbul for the first leg of their play-off against Besiktas.

Both teams had chances in an open game, while Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain hit the post late on.

The visitors were playing the latter period of the game with ten men after Aaron Ramsey was sent off for two petulant yellow cards. 

Besiktas: TBA

Arsenal: TBA

Final whistle goes, sorry about the lack of goals...

Arsenal probably had the best of the chances tonight, hitting the post late on, but after Aaron Ramsey's sending off will have to take a draw away from home.

They'll be back at the Emirates next week, and will be eager to make the group stage.

90mins: Late sub for Arsenal, who will be happy with this scoreline now, despite that near miss.

Credit to Mathieu Debuchy, who has been brilliant going forward, and in defence on the right.

88mins: That was absolutely brilliant from Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain. Dribbling in from the right-hand side, the midfielder unleashes a shot on his weaker foot which the goalkeeper does well to tip onto the post.

83mins: Arsenal understandably sitting back now, its Besiktas' time to attack. Kerim Frei, formerly of Fulham, is on for Ozyakup who seemed to be losing his temper.

80mins: Well this makes things interesting... Aaron Ramsey picked up a cheap first yellow for tugging back his opponent, and he makes the same mistake.

Tugs back Ozyakup after losing possession, and now the visitors have a real challenge on their hands.

72mins: Second sub for Arsenal, as the hugely promising Alexis Sanchez goes off. Like for like swap with the Ox coming on.

68mins: Finally Arsenal burst into life into the second half. Great passing down the right between Sanchez and Debuchy, and the right-backs pull-back finds Giroud... but his shot is blocked.

Approaching the 70th minute, Wenger has the likes of Rosicky, Oxlade-Chamberlain and Joel Campbell available should he wish to change things up.

66mins: Monreal joins Ramsey and Flamini in the book for Arsenal as he catches Mustafa late as the midfielder tried to play Demba Ba through.

59mins: Neither team committing too much at the moment. Few shots from long range here and there, but little else. You would think Besiktas would have to come out and attack, being the home team.

55mins: It's almost like his job is collecting yellows. Mathieu Flamini goes into the book, a flurry of sorts at the moment.

53mins: Lots of challenges going in so I'm surprised that's the first booking of the game. Motta cynically takes out Alexis Sanchez on the halfway line as the Chilean broke past him.

Minutes later Aaron Ramsey pulls back Ozyakup and earns himself a cheap yellow.

50mins: Worry for Arsenal with Everton up next, skipper Mikel Arteta hobbles off with a knock. Flamini replaces him, while Koscielny takes the captain's armband.

Arsenal made it into half-time for refuge but the second-half has exactly the same feel. Besiktas quicker and sharper to the ball, more aggressive. Arsenal would probably take the 0-0 if it were on offer at the moment.

47mins: Arsenal carved open. Olcay is played in down the left with so much space to run in to - he cuts inside, opens up the shot into the far corner, but Szczesny will be relieved to see that one curl just wide.

Away we go again. No shot from kick-off this time. So much for entertainment, Arsenal...

Well that was different, eh? The Champions League is back, and it was so nearly back with a bang with Demba Ba's five-second shot off the bar from kick-off.

It's been end-to-end in Istanbul, but both teams can't quite execute their final ball.

Alexis Sanchez has looked lively for the visitors, while Olivier Giroud should really have opened the scoring.

45mins: Oh dear. It hasn't been Olivier's half. A beautiful chipped ball finds the Franchman but he misses his left-footed volley completely.

44mins: Rare lack of composure from Calum Chambers. The youngster attempts a crossfield pass to his centre-back partner, but it's intercepted by Ba.

The striker twists and turns and his shot wrong foots Szczesny, but it's just wide.

Athletic Bilbao have just taken a surprise lead away at Napoli, Iker Muniain with that goal. Seems to be a thriller in Copenhagen too, with Bayer Leverkusen leading 3-2.

38mins: Great effort from Jack Wilshere. The midfielder plays a one-two with Giroud, and after looking up to see no one in front of him, curls towards goal from 25 yards.

The keeper does well to dive and save and hold. That was heading towards the top corner.

30mins: Slight appeal for a penalty there for Besiktas. Chambers tracks Veli and doesn't get the ball, but the player wasn't going for it himself. Right decision from the referee.

Chambers so full of composure for Arsenal at the back. This is his first Champions League game and he is clearly enjoying himself out there. Everything about him is measured and controlled.

25mins: Plenty of whistles as Arsenal try and build attacks. Giroud, who has been somewhat sluggish so far, nearly picks out Alexis Sanchez with a dinked cross.

Arsenal in the ascendancy as the hosts sit back.

18mins: This game settling down after a fast and frenetic start. Alexis Sanchez really does look in the mood, while Calum Chambers has started well at the back for Arsenal.

Seems they just have to be patient.

13mins: But this is much better from Arsenal now. Sanchez again involved, his cut back finds Santi Cazorla, whose shot zips past the post from a tight angle.

Arsenal have a holding midfielder on the bench in Mathieu Flamimi and it looks like they could do with him in the early part of this game. Arsenal’s midfield being over-run in the opening spell.

12mins: Seems to be so much space for Arsenal on the right. This time Aaron Ramsey tries to break clear but the referee doesn't play advantage after a trip on Sanchez.

10mins: Great ball from Ozyakup over the top of Calum Chambers to find Ba. The Senegalese striker connects well with his left foot on the volley, but the goalkeeper does well to palm it away. Looking really dangerous here, the hosts.

But here's Arsenal on the break! Sanchez bursts clear but his cross is deflected and Giroud can't quite get it out of his feet.

5mins: All over the place at the minute Arsenal. The hosts are playing nice quick football on this 'questionable' surface. Arsene Wenger's side struggling to get going.

Away we go! And off the bar immediately! A shot straight from kick-off troubles Wojciech Szczesny. What a start... Demba Ba with the effort.

And the atmosphere is incredible in Istanbul. Arsenal will surely be happy enough with a draw here. Can they start on the front foot?

Speaking to ITV before the game: 'It's windy and pitch is not the best at all, we will have to adapt.'

Arsenal fans will hope they do that quickly...

Worryingly also, he says Koscielny declared himself fit: 'Koscielny has inflamation but he has declared himself fit, you have to trust the player.'

We know what Arsenal can bring, but what about Besiktas?

One player to look out for is Oğuzhan Özyakup who is a former youth product in North London.

Wenger said: 'I always thought he could make a career but at our club he had big competition in front of him and that is why we let him go.

'It is good to see he has made it to the top level and is now an important player in Turkey.'

Arsenal have won all 12 of their previous Champions league play-off matches. That's some record.

They have also scored eight goals in their last two games in Istanbul, against Fenerbahce and Galatasaray.

It may be tough tonight though at the Olympic Stadium. Perhaps they should ask Liverpool for some advice...

Demba Ba has spoken this week about how Jose Mourinho stopped his move to Arsenal last summer, and he now believes he didn't play for Chelsea as he wasn't a star name.

‘Sometimes when you are at a club with a lot of big stars, the name counts for more than the statistics. Unfortunately, it was like that in my case,’ he said.

Time to prove your point!

As expected Demba Ba starts for the hosts, looking to build on his two goals in five games against the Gunners.

For Arsenal, Olivier Giroud comes in for the injured Yaya Sanogo, and similarly Nacho Monreal replaces Kieran Gibbs.

Alexis Sanchez will be looking to score his first goal for the club, and don't forget about Aaron Ramsey...

Szczesny; Debuchy, Koscielny, Chambers, Monreal; Arteta, Ramsey; Cazorla, Wilshere, Sanchez; Giroud.

Subs: Martinez, Bellerin, Miquel, Flamini, Rosicky, Oxlade-Chamberlain & J.Campbell.

Tolga, İsmail, Motta, Ersan, Pedro, Olcay, Veli, Necip, Oğuzhan, Mustafa, Demba Ba

Concrete information should arrive shortly, but we can gather certain aspects about Arsenal's line up.

Calum Chambers is expected to make his Champions League debut after impressing in recent weeks, while it will be interesting to see whether Alexis Sanchez starts.

The Chilean struggled somewhat in the 2-1 victory against Crystal Palace at the weekend, and could be rested for this weekend's trip to Everton.

Hit them where it hurts!

Lukas Podolski may not be here (though there is still Wojciech Szczesny), but Besiktas manager Slavan Bilic says his side will be battling on the pitch... not taking pictures.

'We are not here to take selfies with Arsenal on the pitch, we are here to battle to the end,' Bilic said at his pre-match press conference.
