Resplendent in brightly coloured silks and neatly pressed suits, professional dancers from all over the world descended on Blackpool this week to compete at the Blackpool Dance Festival.

The world's largest ballroom dancing competition has received a boost in recent years courtesy of enormously popular BBC show, Strictly Come Dancing, and as a result, the festival attracted a record 2,953 couples from 60 different countries last year.

Contestants taking to the floor at this year's event will compete in both Latin and Standard dancing, and will have to perform a number of complex routines, including pulling off the perfect Viennese Waltz, Quickstep and Paso Doble.

Categories include the British Amateur Ballroom Championships and the British
 Professional Ballroom Championships, both of which are only open to UK 
competitors, and the British Open Dance Championships and Amateur Open 
Dance Championships, which are open to all.

Like the challengers on the BBC show, hopefuls will have to endure the scrutiny of a strict judging panel that includes some of the biggest names in dance, among them 14-time Professional World Latin Dance champion, Gaynor Fairweather.

The festival, which has been a key part of the ballroom dancing calendar since 1920, is staged in the huge Empress Ballroom at the Victorian Winter Gardens entertainment complex and started life as a novelty dance competition.

Early incarnations included country and Morris dancing but both were dropped after two years. Instead 'stage dancing', the precursor of modern ballroom dancing, was allowed to dominate, with more dances added each year.

After a one-year break in 1928, the Blackpool Dance Festival was relaunched in June 1929, with events that included the North of England Professional and Amateur Championships, an Amateur Veleta Competition, a Veterans Waltz Competition plus an Original Sequence Dance Competition.Â

Ready
 for action: Not everyone can call on the services of a designer, which 
leaves an opening for boutique owners who can sell direct to dancers 
during the festival

In 1931, as 'English dancing' continued to develop, the Blackpool Dance Festival became home to the first British Professional and Amateur Ballroom Championships.

Although held just once during the long years of the Second World War, the competition was revived in 1946 and swiftly became a popular draw for visitors to Blackpool.

During the 1950s, its popularity began to go global, with competitors from Japan, Denmark, Germany, Italy and the USA joining British couples as they went head-to-head for the trophy.

Now a truly global event attracting competitors from more than 60 different countries, Blackpool's Dance Festival remains a key part of the ballroom dancing calendar - and a glittering spectacle for the rest of us.
