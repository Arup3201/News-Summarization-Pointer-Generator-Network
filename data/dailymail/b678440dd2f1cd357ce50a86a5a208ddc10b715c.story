While some grown men may secretly hold on to a beloved teddy bear, 36-year-old Jena Pang is happy to show the world his favourite stuffed toys... all 250 of them.

The  ex-solicitor is rarely seen in public without one of his treasured bears at his side.

Jena, who still lives with his mother in Essex, flies them first class when he goes on holiday and takes them to the theatre and opera at Glyndebourne.

Vast collection: Jena Pang with some of his teddy bears. The musician is auctioning off his £150,000 collection of a hundred antique teddy bears - because if he took them with him to his new home in Hong Kong he believes they will rot

He has also shared afternoon tea with them at some of London’s finest restaurants including The Ritz, The Dorchester and The Savoy.

And at home he lines them up as an audience for his young pupils as he teaches the piano and violin.

Jena started collecting antique teddies in 2002 as an investment and since then has bought around 500 of them - spending around £200,000.

He sold half in 2010 and is now about to auction a further 120 as he prepares to move to Hong Kong, where his family originate from.

Out and about: Jena Pang and his mother, who he lives with, with teddy Hoi Sum enjoying afternoon tea at the Four Seasons hotel. He started collecting antique toys in 2002 and the hobby has seen him spend £200,000 on around 500 bears

Jena fears many of his rarer bears - some up to 100 years old - will not survive the tropical humidity of the Far East and is reluctantly saying goodbye to them.

His collection includes 32 Steiff bears which are expected to fetch a staggering £100,000 at the auction next month. The remaining bears could raise a further £50,000.

Jena, who lives with his mother in Southend, Essex, said: 'I have loved teddy bears since I was a child.

'In my music training I used to have bears around the room as my audience to play to.

'As I have got older and madder I have had them all around as audiences for my pupils to prepare them for concerts.

'Teddy bears are very special because they are like special friends. They all have characters and they all know our secrets.'

Swanky lifestyle: Roddy and Jena Pang lunching at Harrods. His bears regularly travel first class, dine with him at The Ritz and even accompany him to the Glyndebourne opera. The music teacher even uses the bears as an audience for his pupils in a bid to prepare them for playing in front of large audiences

He added: 'I viewed them as an investment. When the economy was doing really bad I decided to invest in teddy bears.

'The property market was dodgy at the time so I thought I should invest in something else and I chose toys.

'Once you get hooked on bear collecting you see there’s a community out there of people who like those kind of things.'

The most Jena has spent on a single bear is £10,000 and most of his vintage ones cost no less than £6,000.

Up for grabs: The 102 lots of the toys will go on the sale next month - with just 32 Steiff bears expected to sell for a staggering £100,000 (here he is pictured with Binky at The Dorchester)

Oxford-educated, he has made his money from the legal profession - and as a talented musician who is proficient at both the piano and violin.

He said: 'The antique bears are made of wood, wool and kapok so in the damp humidity they would begin to rot.

'To have such an amazing collection just rot away would be such a shame. I would be mortified if anything happened to them.

'If I was to be selfish and take them with me then they would just rot and a future generation would be robbed of them.

'In Hong Kong people have clothes which go mouldy and I can’t keep these bears in an air conditioned unit 24/7.

'For me I just want to preserve the toys for a future generation and to have that collection survive.

'I am saddened to have to lose my bears but at the same time I’m glad other people are going to be able to enjoy them.'

Dining out: He takes the bears to luxurious places like The Dorchester and says they know all of his secrets

Collector's items: Oxford-educated, he has made his money from the legal profession - and as a talented musician who is proficient at both the piano and violin 

Saddened: He says that he just wants to preserve the toys for a future generation and to have that collection survive so he is auctioning them off 

Daniel Agnew is one of the UK’s top teddy bear specialists and said Jena’s collection will generate worldwide interest.

He said: 'This is the best single owner collection of early Steiff bears to be seen at auction for many years and it is certainly the finest collection of antique bears ever to appear regionally in the UK.

'With such fine examples on offer, we anticipate a great deal of worldwide interest in this sale.'

After the sale Jena’s collection will be reduced to just a hundred modern artist bears.

His antique toys will be put up for sale at Special Auction Services in Newbury, Berks., on December 4.
