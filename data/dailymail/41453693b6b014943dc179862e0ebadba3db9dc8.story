Gareth Bale trained with a smile on his face as Chris Coleman’s Wales squad prepared for their crucial Euro 2016 clash in Israel.

The world’s most expensive player took part in light jogging exercises and skipped over mini hurdles amid the scenic surroundings of the Vale Resort in Cardiff.

The serene atmosphere was a world away from the heated scenes he left in Spain, where irate Real Madrid fans attacked his white Bentley in the early hours of Monday morning.

The Wales superstar appeared in good spirits as he was put through his paces with the Wales squad 

Bale, the world's most expensive player, has endured a troubled time at Real Madrid in recent weeks 

Bale was in a group including Aaron Ramsey, Joe Allen, James Collins and Chris Gunter as Liverpool coach Ryland Morgans put the players through their paces.

In one drill, the squad, split into four sections, dribbled with the ball around cones turning around a metal dummy and passing  to a team-mate. At one point Bale broke into laughter when Allen badly miscalculated his attempt.

At the end of the 15-minute segment open to media, West Ham’s Collins joked: ‘Good work lads, see you tomorrow.’ Coleman then went through more detailed training behind closed doors.

Captain Ashley Williams said the players, including Bale, have fresh bills of health for the clash in Haifa.

‘Everyone is fit and ready,' said the Swansea defender. ‘The camp is buzzing. We had a good night on Monday seeing the guys we haven’t seen for a while.

‘We are looking to do some good work on the field this week and get the job done.’

Wales will fly to Tel Aviv on Thursday afternoon before travelling up to Haifa for the match at the Sammy Ofer Stadium between the top two teams in Group B.
