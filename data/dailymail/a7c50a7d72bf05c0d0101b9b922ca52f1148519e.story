A truck driver was using his phone to look at pictures of women on Facebook when he crashed into three police cars and two police trucks, killing a police officer.

The whole incident was captured on the driver's dashcam and shows the heartstopping moment Jorge Espinoza ploughs into the emergency vehicles at 65mph on an Arizona interstate.

Arizona Department of Public Safety officer Tim Huffman was killed in the May 6 wreck on eastbound Interstate 8 in Yuma County, the Arizona Star reports.

Espinoza has been charged with second-degree murder.

Shock: Espinoza (pictured left) only realises the police cars are in the road when he hits one. He had been looking at pictures of women on his phone

The investigation was made public today and shows Espinoza was driving at 65 mph with the cruise control on along the straight carriageway.

At the start of the video, Espinoza has his face obscured by a wallet on the dashboard but the truck's other camera, pointed at the road, shows the danger looming up in front of him.

His Samsung Galaxy 3 phone flies out of his hand as the truck smashes into the first police car before bouncing off and hitting the other vehicles. Six vehicles, including the truck and trailer, were destroyed by the impact.

Espinoza originally told police he he didn't see the police cars because he was looking in his mirror at a passing truck. He also said he never uses his phone while driving because it is against company policy.

Frightening: He desperately tries to hang on to the wheel and wrestle the truck back under control as it smashes into another emergency vehicle

However, when police examined his phone they discovered he had been using the internet at the time of the crash.

He was on Facebook looking at 'photographs of several women in provocative positions, wearing little clothing', 'photographs of a woman in a low cut dress', and photos of a man 'smoking something', according to police reports.

Espinoza had also used his phone to look at YouTube, female escort web pages, porn sites and social networks on other occasions when he was logged in as driving, investigators said.

Emergency services were in the area dealing with an earlier crash and tending to people with injuries.Â

Other officers and medics who were with Huffman saw the crash and tried to save Huffman, who had been sitting in his car.

They pulled the windshield and dash off his car to try to help him, and they got a jaws of life tool, used to cut cars apart, out of one of the crashed fire trucks, but he died at the scene.

Investigators concluded: 'Espinoza would have been able to perceive the danger in the roadway and not cause the death of Officer Tim Huffman, endangered the lives of 11 other emergency responders and destroyed six vehicles, including a new semi-tractor and trailer owned by his employer, if he had not chosen to distract himself while accessing Facebook from his cellular telephone while operating his assigned commercial vehicle.'
