Two Saudi border guards and their commanding officer have been killed  following a suicide bomb and gun attack near the Iraqi border.

The deadly attack along the 745-mile border is the first since the country joined the U.S.-led coalition conducting airstrikes against Islamic State (ISIS) militants in Syria.

Two of the assailants were shot dead during yesterday's attack, while one detonated an explosive belt he was wearing. The other was shot dead by security forces, the interior ministry said.

No group immediately claimed responsibility for the attack, which also left three border guards wounded.

But Mustafa Alani, an Iraqi security analyst with close ties to Saudi Arabia's interior ministry, said the use of a suicide bomber pointed to ISIS.

He said: 'It is the first attack by Islamic State itself against Saudi Arabia and is a clear message after Saudi Arabia entered the international coalition against it.'

The incident took place after four gunmen, believed to have come from inside Iraq, opened fire on the guards.

Interior Ministry spokesman Mansour al-Turki said four 'terrorists' had fired on the patrol at around 4:30 am in the Northern Borders Province.

They had been spotted crossing the border near Judayyidat Arar  at dawn.

Judayyidat Arar is close to the border with Iraq's western province of Anbar, parts of which are controlled by IS and its Sunni Arab allies. 

The Interior Ministry said the guards returned fire, killing two attackers. The other two tried to flee and hide, the ministry said. 

'The terrorists opened fire and the patrol responded accordingly. As a result, one of the terrorists was killed while another terrorist detonated an explosive belt he was wearing when the patrol tried to convince him to surrender himself,' the spokesman said. 

'The patrol called on them to surrender, but one of them blew himself up while the other was killed by security men.'  

Saudi government websites said the commander of the border guard in the area, Brigadier General Oud Awad al-Balawi, was among those killed. 

The government-linked Sabq news website reported that the gunmen were armed with hand grenades, pistols and explosive belts.  

Residents in the area told how the Saudi military aircraft could be seen overhead throughout the day.  

In November, Saudis living nearby were asked to relocate for at least a year to allow a 20km (12-mile) buffer zone to be created. 

The order also included widening buffer zones in the Eastern Province border city of Hafr al-Batin, near Kuwait and Iraq, and Tabuk Province, near Jordan.

The decision was announced around the same time that IS leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi called on supporters to launch attacks inside Saudi Arabia in retaliation for the airstrikes.

Saudi Arabia has spent billions of dollars reinforcing security and building a heavily fortified fence along the border following the U.S.-led war in Iraq and its violent aftermath.
