An Alberta man whose German shepherd named Dozer was snatched from his backyard spent a year and a half searching for the pooch before finally giving up.

But when Richard Brower of Lethbridge finally decided to look for a new dog online, the search was much shorter.

After 18 months of heartache, Brower's own dog was the first one he found himself face-to-face with at his computer.

Distraught: Richard Brower of Lethbridge, Alberta searched for 18 months after his beloved German shepherd Dozer was stolen

'The very first thing I saw was a huge picture of Dozer, and my heart stopped,' Brower told Globalnews.ca.

Up until that point, Brower had searched high and low for the 125-pound dog.

He'd enlisted his motorcycle riding friends to comb the neighborhood and all but shook down every German shepherd owner he stumbled across, all for naught.

'It's the closest thing to a miracle in my life,' he told CNN.

Dozer had been stolen from Brower's backyard, but not from his heart. Nonetheless, the time had recently come for Brower to get a new companion.

'I never gave up hope,' Brower said, 'I'd just come to the realization that I couldn't go on without another dog.'

Unbelievable: Miraculously, the first time he searched the internet for German shepherds after deciding to get a new dog, he was led to a picture of Dozer

'It's the closest thing to a miracle in my life,' said Brower

Found: Dozer was stolen out of Brower's yard but now Brower says he's glad he searched hopefully all those 18 months

After his startling discovery of Dozer at the Claresholm Animal Rescue Society site, he showed the photo to his family.

Brower's father was on his way home from a business trip when he stopped at the shelter--which is in a town 50 miles from Brower's home--to investigate.

After a couple of quick tests, Brower's dad determined it was Dozer.

Staff at Claresholm said they'd picked up Dozer as he was running along a highway nearly an hour from where Brower lives.

'My dad was bawling, I was bawling on the phone,' he said. And when Dozer came home 'he came flying in, put his head into my arm and started doing that wailing that German shepherds do.'

All those months of holding out hope had paid off for Brower.

'It's the closest thing to a miracle in my life,' he said.
