The number of cases of highly-contagious scarlet fever has soared to a 24 year high, figures show.

Health officials said that there have been ‘widespread’ increases in the number of cases in England.

During February there were significantly more cases of the bacterial illness than would normally be expected for this time of year, according to Public Health England (PHE).

The number of cases of scarlet fever in England soared to a 24 year high in February this year

In the four weeks to February 23, health officials were notified of 868 cases of scarlet fever - over the last four years experts have noted an average of 444 cases.

Officials said that the figure is at its highest for this time of year since 1990.

The increase has been noted across England apart from in the North West.

Scarlet fever is a bacterial illness that causes a distinctive red rash.

It is not common in the UK anymore and is usually mild.

The characteristic symptom of the illness is a widespread red rash that feels like sandpaper to touch.

Other symptoms include a high temperature, a flushed face and a red, swollen tongue.

The illness usually follows a sore throat or a skin infection.

It is extremely contagious and can be contracted by breathing in bacteria after someone has sneezed or coughed, by touching the skin of an infected person or by sharing contaminated towels, clothes or bed lined.

Anybody can catch scarlet fever but it is most common in children aged two to eight.

An interim report on the infection states: ‘Routine monitoring of surveillance data has identified widespread increases in scarlet fever notifications in February 2014, beyond those seasonally expected. These are the highest notification totals for this time of year since 1990.’

A PHE spokeswoman said that there are seasonal rises in scarlet fever between December and April each year.

Every few years there is also a notable increase in the number of cases and the latest bout of infections is likely to be part of that cycle, she added.

The organisation has warned health officials to be ‘mindful’ of the current rise in figures when treating patients.

The most noticeable symptom of scarlet fever is a distinctive pink-red rash that feels like sandpaper to touch.

Other symptoms include a high temperature, a flushed face and a red, swollen tongue.

It is ‘extremely contagious’ and can be caught by breathing in bacteria from an infected person's coughs and sneezes, touching the skin of a person with a streptococcal skin infection and sharing contaminated towels, baths, clothes or bed linen.

PHE's head of streptococcal infection 
surveillance Dr Theresa Lamagni said: ‘The first symptoms of scarlet 
fever often include a sore throat, headache, fever, nausea, and 
vomiting.

There has been an increase in the number of scarlet fever cases everywhere in England except for in the North West. Image shows the bacteria that causes scarlet fever

‘Between 12 to 48 hours after this, a characteristic rash develops. Cases are more common in children although adults can also develop scarlet fever.

‘Symptoms usually clear up after a week and in the majority of cases remain reasonably mild providing a course of antibiotics is completed to reduce the risk of complications.

‘Children or adults diagnosed with scarlet fever are advised to stay at home until at least 24 hours after the start of antibiotic treatment to avoid passing on the infection.

‘We will continue to closely monitor these increases and work with healthcare professionals to try and halt the spread of infection.’
