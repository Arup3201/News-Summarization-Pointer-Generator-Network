Moscow is home to more billionaires than any other place in the world, a newly published rich list has revealed.

The Russian capital has 76 dollar billionaires, while New York comes a close second with 70, followed by Hong Kong's 54, Beijing's 41 and London's 40.

But despite Moscow being the 
location of choice for the super rich, it is Mexico City which lays 
claim to the world's richest man, telecoms tycoon Carlos Slim, 73, who is
worth $66 billion (£44bn).

But none of the richest ten people 
live in Moscow. Instead, French capital Paris is the only place to be 
home to more than one of the top ten - Bernard Arnault and Liliane Bettencourt.

Mr Slim is followed by the $58 
billion (£39bn) of US investor Warren Buffet, 82, $55 billion (£37bn) of
Spanish fashion executive Amancio Ortega, 76, and $54 billion (£36bn) 
of Microsoft's Bill Gates.

Moscow's
richest resident is Alisher Usmanov, a steel magnate and shareholder in
Arsenal Football Club, who has $19 billion (£13bn).

The country's second wealthiest individual is energy and metals tycoon - and renowned Faberge egg collector - Vicktor Vekselberg, whose fortune is valued at $18 billion (£12bn).

billionaires, comes out on top in the list of country, and is followed

fortunes are self-made of inherited.

It found that the industry to produce the most billionaires was real estate, with 219 people making their fortune from property.

All
the Russian billionaires are listed as self-made, unlike other European
countries where many are said to have inherited their wealth.

Sao Paolo, Brazil, Geneva, Switzerland, Seoul, South Korea, Tokyo, Japan and San Francisco, Los Angeles,Beverley Hills, Dallas and Houston in the U.S. all featured in the top 20.

4. Germany (61)

5. UK (56)

6. India (53)

London's richest resident is Lakshmi Mittal, who is ranked 36th in the world with $18 billion (£12bn). 

The
steel magnate bought the world's most expensive house in 2004 when he 
paid £70 million for a 12 bedroom mansion in Kensington, in the west of 
the city.

Hurun Report was set up by British 
accountant Rupert Hoogewerf in 1999 and is based in Shanghai, China, 
which itself features in the list of top 20 cities.

1. Asia (608 billionaires)

2. North America (440 billionaires)

3. Europe (324 billionaires)

4. South  America (49 billionaires)

5. Africa (17 billionaires)

5. Oceania (17 billionaires)

The report highlighted how the net assets of the 10 richest people rose 22 per cent over the year - or $250 million a day.

But the report added: 'This past year has seen a rebound in the wealth of the private sector'

Mr Hoogewerf said the number of 
billionaires maybe up to three times higher because some of the world's 
super rich hid their fortune.

He said: 'Some people deliberately 
make their wealth a secret because they gained it through illegal ways. 
Some others simply prefer to keep a low profile.'
