West Ham could be kicked out of the FA Cup if found guilty by FIFA of illegally playing Senegal striker Diafra Sakho in their fourth-round win at Bristol City last month.

FIFA have opened disciplinary proceedings against the London club after Senegal complained that Sakho should not have played.

The 25-year-old, who scored the only goal in a 1-0 West Ham win, withdrew from the Senegal squad for the Africa Cup of Nations with a back injury and FIFA rules say a player cannot appear for a club if he was meant to be on international duty.

West Ham deny any wrongdoing and want the case dismissed. Sanctions by FIFA could involve expulsion from the FA Cup, a ban on the player or a fine.

West Ham maintain Sakho did not team up with Senegal because his back problem meant he could not fly.

Co-chairman David Sullivan told Sportsmail last week: ‘A top back surgeon said Sakho can’t fly and he still can’t fly. He went by car to Bristol.

‘We are sure any FIFA hearing will vindicate us. The player missed four games as a result of injuries incurred while playing for Senegal. We have done nothing untoward.’

Manager Sam Allardyce, who left Sakho out of the Premier League trip to Liverpool on Saturday, said: ‘I’m not worried that he will face a ban. We have stuck by every rule and regulation in the book.’
