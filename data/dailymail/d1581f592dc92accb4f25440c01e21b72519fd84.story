A nine-year-old boy was handcuffed, blindfolded and taken to a detention centre where he was interrogated for five hours over allegations of rock throwing, an Israeli human rights group claims.

According to B'Tselem, the boy was only released after it was determined he was a minor.

Troops had earlier seized his eight-year-old brother on the West Bank in February, releasing him only when they realised they were looking for his brother.

Over the past five years, Israel's military has detained and tried more than 800 Palestinian youths and children for throwing rocks at Israeli soldiers, jailing most of them, the group said in a report released today.

Drawing on military statistics and interviews for its 70-page report, B'Tselem counted 835 minors who were charged with rock throwing from 2005 through early 2011, including 34 children who were 13 years old or younger.Military spokeswoman Lt. Col. Avital Leibovich said around 160 civilians and soldiers were wounded in violent attacks by minors during that period. Her office added that 10 were wounded by rocks.

B'Tselem acknowledged that while Israeli authorities needed to enforce the law, they said night raids, handcuffing, blindfolds, interrogations and the denial of access to lawyers for children for hours at a time were frequently disproportionate to the crime.

'The authorities need to enforce the law, but they should do it in lawful ways that is appropriate for the crime and the people committing the crime,' said the report's author, Naama Baumgarten-Sharon.

Leibovich said that the military handled children with sensitivity and that their arrest was a justified response to violence.

The B'Tselem report noted the situation for child detainees improved after the military established special juvenile courts, but said Palestinian minors were denied rights afforded to Israeli children.

Israel has complained for decades about Palestinian children taking part in often violent demonstrations, charging that they are being exploited. Many Palestinian parents see their children as young fighters resisting Israel's occupation of the West Bank.

Rock throwing, specifically, is seen as symbolic of their struggle.

The issue has flared in the past few years as Palestinians hold weekly demonstrations in West Bank villages in which young men and boys throw rocks and chunks of concrete at Israeli soldiers.

The soldiers have used tear gas, rubber bullets and sometimes live fire in response, killing some demonstrators and badly wounding others.

Of the more than 800 minors charged with hurling rocks over the past five years, only one youth was acquitted in a trial. Another 93 percent were given jail terms in plea bargains, agreeing mostly because they feared being detained while they waited for their cases to reach trial, said Baumgarten-Sharon.

More than 500 of the youths were around 16 years old, the report said. Another 255 were 14 and 15, and 34 were 13 or younger. The older the youths, the more likely they were given longer sentences, sometimes of months in jail.

Military spokeswoman Leibovich said the children's fate lay with their families and Palestinian groups, whom she accused of sending out children to confront Israelis.

'We are talking about minors that actually use rocks and explosive devices to target Israeli civilians and soldiers,' she said.Â
