Winter Olympic skeleton gold medalist Lizzy Yarnold has pulled out of the second World Cup event of the season in Calgary this week under medical advice.

The 26-year-old from Kent, who was shortlisted for this year's BBC Sports Personality of the Year award which went to Formula One world champion Lewis Hamilton on Sunday, experienced symptoms of dizziness during her victory at the season opener in Lake Placid on Friday and will not compete in Calgary.

British skeleton's performance adviser Andi Schmid confirmed the news, saying: 'It is better that Lizzy sits out the second World Cup.

'The forces experienced by sliders are considerable during their runs down the track. We must make sure that she is fully fit before racing again'.

Yarnold proved untouchable on the world skeleton circuit this season finishing top of the rankings in the World Cup before powering to gold in Sochi in February.

Yarnold promised she would come back stronger for the trips to Europe early in the new year with Altenberg, Konigsee and St Moritz all hosting events in the World Cup series next month.

She said: 'I'm naturally disappointed not to be able to race on Friday. I enjoyed getting back into the mindset last week and winning.

'I felt dizzy at the end of the first run in Lake Placid but felt okay before the second run and knew that I could go for it but in our sport where we are travelling at such high speeds these things happen and we have to look after ourselves.

'I'm going to spend the time over Christmas resting so that I can come back stronger in 2015.'
