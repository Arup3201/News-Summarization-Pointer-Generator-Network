A judge who let a man who  held a knife to his wife's throat escape jail has come under fire after the defendant left court and boasted on Facebook: 'The c*** didn't win I'm free'.

Anthony Bruce, 34, from Chester-le-Street, County Durham, made the comment on social media after being handed a suspended sentence at Teesside Crown Court by Judge George Moorhouse.

Bruce had admitted assault occasioning actual bodily harm and a charge of witness intimidation at yesterday's hearing and was handed a 12-month jail sentence, suspended for 12 months.

Judge Moorhouse also ordered him to partake in an alcohol treatment order and made him the subject of a restraining order, but his judgement has been largely criticised by top police chiefs who have deemed the ruling as 'wholly wrong'.

According to the Northern Echo, Bruce bit and tried to choke his partner when she spoke about them splitting up at their County Durham home in April last year.

He also threatened to shoot her in the eye, before firing a pellet into her foot before she managed to escape.

Days after he was arrested, Bruce rang her and said 'drop the charges or I will torch...' but she put the phone down before he could finish the threat, the newspaper report said. 

Two police crime commissioners and a domestic abuse charity have now criticised the judge for the 'lenient' sentence, with one calling for judges to be given more training.

Ron Hogg, Durham's Police Crime Commissioner, said: 'This judgement totally beggars belief. It is astonishing considering what he has done.'

Speaking about Bruce's foul-mouthed boasting on Facebook, Mr Hogg added: 'His response to getting off free is just outrageous.

'This is not justice in any way.'

Vera Baird, Northumbria Police Crime Commissioner who, like Mr Hogg, has led a major campaign to tackle domestic violence, said the case showed that judges need more training.

She highlighted Judge Moorhouse's remarks where he reportedly said the defendant had not been in trouble for seven years.

'Domestic violence is a private crime, it's a secret crime and to say that the guy has behaved himself for seven years is a very poor reason for dealing with him leniently,' she said.

'We have no idea how he was behaving in the house.

'I think the judge has got it wholly wrong and we have to train our judges properly.'

Clare Phillipson, director of Wearside Women in Need, said: 'I feel a combination of disbelief and fury.'

She was shocked the witness intimidation charge alone did not warrant a jail sentence.

'On every level the judge has failed in his duty,' she said.

The Crown Prosecution Service cannot appeal to the Attorney General about the leniency of the sentence.

A CPS spokesman said: 'There is limited provision made within law for prosecutors to challenge a sentence which they believe to be an unduly lenient.

'However, there are strict guidelines on the type of cases that prosecutors can refer to the Attorney General's office for consideration.

'Section 47 assault and intimidation are both offences for which a referral would not be possible under existing legislation.'
