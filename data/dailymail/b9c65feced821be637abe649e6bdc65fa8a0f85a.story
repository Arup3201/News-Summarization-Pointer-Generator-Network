A leading allergy doctor has debunked a host of myths, saying that gluten allergy doesn’t exist – and nor do hypoallergenic pets.

Dr David Stukus, an allergy specialist from Columbus, Ohio, wrote a presentation debunking various common allergy misconceptions after years of hearing patients declare inaccuracies.

One pet peeve is the patients who say they can’t eat bread because they’re allergic to gluten, he says.

All in the bread? Gluten allergy - which deters many people from eating bread - is not actually a real affliction, a doctor has said. While wheat is a recognised allergy, many people  misinterpret that as gluten,' he says

‘There’s this claim about “gluten allergy,” which really doesn’t exist,’ he told the website today.com.

‘It’s not really a recognised allergy. Wheat is a recognised allergy — but a lot of people will misinterpret that as gluten. Wheat allergy does not necessarily  equal an allergy to all gluten.

He continued: 'Gluten has been blamed for all that ails humanity.'  In fact, there are only three disorders that can be scientifically attributed to gluten, he says: coeliac disease, wheat allergies and non-coeliac gluten sensitivity.

Coeliac disease is what's known as an autoimmune condition. This is where 
the immune system  mistakenly 
attacks healthy tissue.

Patients with non-coeliac gluten sensitivity (NCGS) display gluten sensitivity symptoms - such as bloating, diarrhoea and stomach pain - but test negative for the disease despite symptoms disappearing on a gluten-free diet.

‘If you think you may have an allergy, you should see a certified allergist for proper evaluation, testing, diagnosis and treatment,’ Dr Stukus said.

Non-existent: Hypoallergenic dogs, such as Bo, the Obama's dog, also don't technically exist, says Dr Stukus

Also in the firing line are so-called hypoallergenic dogs.

Dr Stukus said: ‘Unfortunately, there is no such thing as a truly hypoallergenic dog or cat. 

‘Allergens are released in saliva, sebaceous glands and perianal glands. It's not the fur people are allergic to.

'It is true that some breeds are more bothersome for allergy sufferers than others’ – which is why some people are fine around some breeds and not others. 

Dr Stukus, whose work is being presented at the Annual Scientific Meeting of the American College of Allergy, Asthma and Immunology (ACAAI), argues that some of these allergy myths can be damaging to health – especially if people wrongly cut out large food groups from their diet – or skip vaccinations.

He said: 'Many early medical beliefs have been 
proven to be incorrect as research has advanced. Unfortunately, some of 
these beliefs are still on the Internet, where an astonishing 72 per 
cent of users turn to for health information.’

Another widely circulated myth is that people suffering from an egg allergy can’t have such jabs – as they may include tiny bits of egg protein. 

He explained: ‘Egg embryos are used to grow viruses for vaccines such as the flu, yellow fever and rabies shots.’

‘However, it's now safe to get the flu shot, which can help prevent serious illness, but a referral to an allergist is recommended beforehand is recommended.’

he also advises against home allergy tests, which can be unreliable. ‘These tests might be able to reveal sensitisation, but being sensitized to a certain allergen, like milk, doesn't mean you're allergic. 

‘These sort of at-home screening tests are not reliable and can often lead to misinterpretation, diagnostic confusion and unnecessary dietary elimination. ‘

Coeliac disease is a common digestive condition where a person has an adverse reaction to gluten -  a protein found in wheat, barley and rye. 

Eating foods containing gluten can trigger a range of symptoms, such as: diarrhoea, bloating,    weight loss and extreme tiredness. 

Contrary to popular belief, coeliac disease isn't an allergy or an intolerance to gluten. It is in fact what's known as an autoimmune condition. This is where the immune system mistakenly attacks healthy tissue.

In cases of coeliac disease, the immune system mistakes substances found inside gluten as a threat to the body and attacks them.

This damages the surface of the small bowel (intestines), disrupting the body’s ability to absorb nutrients from food.
