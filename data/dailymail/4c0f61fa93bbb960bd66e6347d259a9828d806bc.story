China's Foreign Ministry says it has 
complained to the United States over its 'irresponsible remarks' about the territorial dispute with Japan over islands in the East China Sea.

China's
Defense Ministry also called Japan's objections to its East China Sea 
Air Defense Identification Zone 'absolutely groundless and unacceptable',
and said it had made solemn representations to the Japanese Embassy in 
Beijing.

But the remarks come as the latest in a continuing war of words over the air space of the disputed Senkaku islands, which has seen Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe brand China's plans unenforceable and dangerous.

Dispute: Uotsuri Island is one of the five uninhabited islands at the centre of an increasingly hostile debate between Japan and China. Both countries name them as their own

Abe told a parliamentary session that China's declaration of an air defense identification zone alters the state of affairs in the East China Sea and escalates a tense situation.

He said: 'The measures by the Chinese side have no validity whatsoever for Japan, and we demand China revoke any measures that could infringe upon the freedom of flight in international airspace.

'It can invite an unexpected occurrence and it is a very dangerous thing as well.'

On Saturday, Beijing issued a map of the zone and a set of rules which say all aircraft must notify Chinese authorities and are subject to emergency military measures if they do not identify themselves or obey Beijing's orders.

Abe said the measures one-sidedly impose rules set by the Chinese military on all flights in the zone, and violate the freedom to fly above open sea, a general principle under the international law.

Abe also slammed China for showing the disputed islands, called Senkaku in Japanese and Diaoyu in Chinese, as Chinese territory in the zone.

Since taking office almost a year ago, Abe has been spearheading a move to step up Japan's defense capability, citing threats from China's growing maritime and military presence in the region. Japan has had a similar zone since the 1960s.

South Korea also complained today about the Chinese zone, which includes the air space above a set of submerged rocks that are controlled by Seoul but also claimed by Beijing.

South Korea's Defense Ministry summoned China's military attache in Seoul, saying the zone is unacceptable because it was drawn unilaterally, according to ministry officials.

Defense Ministry spokesman Kim Min-seok said South Korea's control over the area remains unchanged and Seoul won't notify China when its planes pass through the region.

In a statement on Sunday Chinese foreign Ministry spokesman Qin Gang said that the zone's aim is to defend China's sovereignty and the security of its airspace and land.

He said it is not aimed at any country and it does not affect freedom of overflight.

But the move has not gone down well over seas and both US Secretary of State John Kerry and Secretary of Defense Chuck Hagel have said the US is 'deeply concerned' about China's action. 

In a statement on Saturday Mr Kerry said: 'This unilateral action constitutes an attempt to change the status quo in the East China Sea.

Warning: US Secretary of State John Kerry speaks to journalists in Bali. China has warned the U.S. to stay out of territorial dispute with Japan over South China Sea

'Escalatory action will only increase tensions in the region and create risks of an incident.'

Qin said China told US Ambassador Gary Locke on Sunday that the US should 'correct its mistakes and stop making irresponsible remarks on China.'

Defense Ministry spokesman Yang Yujun said the ministry had complained to the US Embassy's military attache on Sunday evening.

The US doesn't take a position on who has sovereignty over the islands but recognizes they are under Japanese administration.

Along with a rise in its economic and military power in recent years, China has become more assertive over its maritime claims. 

China claims over the islands extend back hundreds of years.

But Japan says it saw no trace of Chinese control of the islands in an 1885 survey and as a resultformally recognised them as Japanese sovereign territory in 1895.

Japan then sold the islands in 1932 to descendants of the original settlers.

After the Japanese surrender at the end of Second World War in 1945 islands fell under the control of the allied forces and were administered by the U.S. occupation force.

But in 1972, Washington returned them to Japan as part of its withdrawal from Okinawa.
