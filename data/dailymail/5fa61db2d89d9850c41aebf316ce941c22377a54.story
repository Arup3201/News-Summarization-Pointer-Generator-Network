French president Francois Hollande is back enjoying secret trysts with an actress almost 20 years his junior, it emerged today. 

News of the Socialist head of state’s renewed love affair with Julie Gayet, 41, emerged as he tried to save his floundering career with a make-or-break television appearance.

As he appeared on a 90 minute broadcast on TF1, a French magazine was releasing pictures of Ms Gayet being driven in and out of the back entrance of the Elysee Palace.

It follows the pair being sensational caught out in January, spending the night in a government flat round the corner from the presidential palace in Paris.

Mr Hollande, 60, was infamously pictured on the back of a moped, as he used a crash helmet to try and disguise his identify.

But he was caught out, and then effectively fired his live-in first lady, Valerie Trierweiler, who promptly checked herself into hospital suffering from a nervous breakdown.

Last night, Mr Hollande was asked about his secret affair with Ms Gayet, and claims by Ms Trierweiler that he is a compulsive liar and a love cheat.

Mr Hollande calmly replied: ‘If I made mistakes, I recognise them. There are pains, and I forgive them.’

But his ambiguous – not to say confusing – reply did not mention the VSD magazine revelations, which are today on news-stands all over France, and on the web.

‘It’s started again,’ is the VSD headline, and its report says the pair now regularly meet at the Elysee itself.

The photos are the first evidence that Ms Gayet is actually staying at the presidential palace, and there are even claims that she has her own bodyguard.

The photographs were taken on October 30th, when the TV actress returned to Paris after taking part in Tokyo Film Festival.

VSD says that Gayet tries to throw photographers off the scent by having a driver approach from different routes, and always enters via a stately back gate.

Asked whether his secret trysts with Ms Gayet had debased the institution of the presidency, Mr Hollande said in the TV interview: ‘I think the responsibility is collective. I don’t want to shirk my responsibilities but there comes a time when one must respect private life.’

Ms Trierweiler, a Paris Match magazine journalist, has written a kiss-and-tell bestseller about Mr Hollande’s deceit, portraying him as a heartless hypocrite.

The President, who has four grown up children with his ecology minister, Segolene Royal, is officially single, and his press office would not comment on the VSD photos.

The latest opinion polls show Mr Hollande’s popularity at a record low of 12 per cent, and his hopes of re-election in 2017 have all but ended.
