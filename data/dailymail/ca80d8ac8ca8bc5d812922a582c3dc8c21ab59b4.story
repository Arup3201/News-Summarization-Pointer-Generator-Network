Bet Google can't even eat cheese: Computers - while helping direct and organise our lives - are still 'dumb boxes' for the moment

Google has spent the last 15 years becoming smarter and smarter, learning how to power our lives - from our homes, our cars, our phones.

But - and with apologies to founders Larry Page and Sergey Brin - all of that work is still no match to the intelligence of a common rat.

Or taking it further, even a gnat.

The point was made by artificial intelligence researchers Yann LeCun and Josh Tenenbaum, who were not criticising the search engine, just pointing out how much further we have to go until we can create computers which contain - or at least, perfectly mimic - intelligent life.

The researchers, speaking at the World Science Festival, pointed out that for all of Google's intelligence, it is still simply learning by rote - just recalling and matching patterns in the information pumped into it.

LeCun, a professor of computer and neural science at New York University, said: 'It's rote learning; there's no understanding.'

He said that even the most powerful computers in the world are, in terms of ability, at best approaching that of an insect - and he added: 'I would be happy in my lifetime to build a machine as intelligent as a rat.'

While many of us benefit from the ease and simplicity of programs like Google Maps for navigation, Tenenbaum, a professor of computational computer science at MIT, said: 'That's very easy.

'It's not even called it AI anymore. It's just called Google.

'That whole context of communication intelligence, of getting inside 
another person just by the data of what they say and you say back, 
that's the heart of human intelligence.'

Clever - but still learning: Google Navigation, pictured here on an Android phone, is a clever, intelligent-seeming system - but it is still just code, following instructions

To give a comparison for the monumental task ahead of AI researchers, LeCun described the mechanics of the human brain - how our brains power 1,000,000,000,000,000,000 connections every single second, all working together to provide us with our continuous self-awareness, learning and curiosity.

But LeCun was optimistic about our chances, saying: 'The power of supercomputers increases exponentially [and we will reach that ability] somewhere between 30 and 100 years.

'Then we wait another 10 or 20 years, and it fits in your smartphone. So then your smartphone is smarter than you.'

Clever technology such as Google is still powered by rote-learning and pattern-matching, say AI researchers...

...But over the next 30 years, super-computers will become smarter, cheaper, and smaller
