A motorist put his Ford Focus ST in for a service but was horrified to learn mechanics had taken it for a 118mph joyride. 

Wayne Clinning, 42, first took his car in for a service at the official Ford garage to check over the speedometer and tracking. 

But when he got his Focus back he said half a tank of fuel had been used so decided to activate the dashboard camera when he returned the car for further repairs. 

When he watched the footage, he was stunned to discover a mechanic joyriding his car at breakneck speeds - reaching up to 118mph.  

Mr Clinning, from Heysham, Lancashire, said: 'They have violated my trust, joy ridden my car and lied to me.'

Wayne Clinning, 42, was furious when a dashboard camera system showed a mechanic joy riding his car

The camera on the central mirror showed the mechanic reaching speeds of 118mph in Mr Clinning's car

Another clip from the test drive shows the mechanic reaching 84mph as he nears a roundabout

During the ten minute test drive near the garage in Morecambe, Lancashire on New Year's Eve, the mechanic drives on the wrong side of the road at 114mph. 

The footage - shot on a tiny camera on the central mirror - also shows him revving the engine, driving as quickly as possible from 0-60mph and squeezing past oncoming traffic.

Worse still, when the mechanism returns to the garage, the audio microphone catches him and a colleague rifling through bags in the car. 

Garage bosses said they were taking the incident 'extremely seriously' and had launched an internal investigation and were taking disciplinary action.  

Father-of-one Mr Clinning said: 'They were just using and abusing my car, flooring it up and down the motorway.

'I bet this happens all the time and they keep getting away with it.

'They may be doing it to everyone's' cars, and people might not even realise.

'It was just like being burgled, them rummaging though my car, and the driving was so dangerous.' 

The father-of-one, watching back the footage, feared they may be doing it to other people's cars as well

The footage showed the mechanic driving at 106mph in a 60-zone during the test drive on New Year's Eve

The clip showed a series of hair-raising moments when the test driver squeezed past cars on a junction

The clip shows the mechanic driving out of the industrial estate - where there is a 30mph speed limit - at 56mph, even when he is approaching a junction. 

Later, a sign at the side of the road shows a 40mph limit but the mechanic cruises at 54mph, speeding up to 84mph as he nears a roundabout.  

He then drives at 106mph in a 60-zone and reaches 108mph as he passes a sign saying 'Police speed check this area' before pushing the car to its limits at 118mph.   

He speeds at 71mph down a 60-zone before performing a U-turn, revving the engine repeatedly, and returning at 93mph.

On a single carriage way 60mph road he also overtakes an MG car and has to squeeze between it and an oncoming car.

His final burst is a 62mph drive down a 40mph road which is half coned off, while he zooms past a sign warning him he is just 250yards from a set of traffic lights.

Finally, back in the garage, two workers can be heard discussing the contents of a bag in the car - with one rummaging through the contents.     

Mr Clinning first took his Ford Focus ST in for a service and new tyres at Pye Motors, Morecambe, just before Christmas, and also asked workers at the official Ford garage to check the speedometer and the tracking

After watching the footage, Mr Clinning went back to complain and showed a staff member the clip. 

He said he was 'absolutely mortified' and offered a full £500 refund and two new tyres.   

Pye Motors director Helen Morley-Pye said the company had reached an 'amicable arrangement' with Wayne.

She said: 'Pye Motors have been trading for ninety years and have always prided ourselves on our customer care and service.

'It was brought to our attention by a customer that he had footage of a member of staff driving his vehicle in excess of the speed limit, taken from a camera in his car.

'As a firm we take any allegation extremely seriously and the incident has been duly investigated with an amicable arrangement reached with Mr Clinnings.

'The member of staff in question has been subject to an internal investigation and dealt with under the terms of our disciplinary procedures.'

A spokeswoman for Lancashire Police said the force was investigating and added: 'Enquiries are on going at this stage.'
