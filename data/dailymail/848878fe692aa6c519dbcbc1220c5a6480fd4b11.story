The export of live farm animals from the UK to the Continent has been suspended after two sheep drowned and 42 had to be shot at Ramsgate.

The incident happened after 500 sheep bound for France were unloaded from a lorry to an area of the port normally used for washing vehicles.

Six fell into an underground water tank. Four were rescued but two drowned. Other sheep then got stones stuck in their hooves and a vet ordered that 42 were lame and should be shot immediately.

Stopped: UK trade with livestock, such as sheep, has now been suspended since the incident in Ramsgate last month where 44 animals died

Farmers have been appalled by grisly pictures of the animals posted on the internet and have questioned the qualifications and expertise of those who slaughtered the lame sheep.

Ramsgate had been the only port in the country which exported animals abroad for slaughter. Following the suspension – by Thanet District Council – the operation was moved to Ipswich but that was also halted due to a lack of suitable facilities.

The decision has delighted animal welfare organisations such as the RSPCA which have campaigned for years to ban the controversial trade.

The shipment, on September 12, had originally been stopped after an inspection found one sheep had a broken leg, another was injured and that there were faults on the lorry.

Two French hauliers have been arrested and bailed while inquiries continue.

According to Compassion in World Farming, fewer than 100,000 animals are exported from Britain each year, down from 2.5 million 20 years ago.

The National Farmers’ Union has demanded a ‘full and frank’ inquiry into the incidents.

But Gavin Grant, chief executive of the RSPCA, said: ‘There is no place in a civilised society for this vile trade that causes so much suffering.’

Thanet District Council said that live exports had been ‘suspended until further notice’.

Last night, Farming Minister David Heath said:  ‘I have ordered an immediate review into the  unacceptable events at Ramsgate.’
