Gilles Simon reached his first Masters-level final in six years by defeating Feliciano Lopez in the semi-finals of the Shanghai Masters on Saturday.

Frenchman Simon beat his Spanish opponent 6-2, 7-6 (7-1) in one hour and 27 minutes and will take on Roger Federer or Novak Djokovic in Sunday's final.

Simon served with great efficiency against Lopez, winning all but two points on his first serve and never facing a break point.

He also handled Lopez's aggressive serve-and-volley game with ease, striking a number of well-placed passing shots down the line for winners and breaking the Spaniard twice.

Simon's ranking had dipped to No 44 in June, but he's lifted his game considerably in recent weeks, defeating world No 5 David Ferrer to reach the fourth round of the US Open and beating two more top-10 players in Shanghai to reach the final.
