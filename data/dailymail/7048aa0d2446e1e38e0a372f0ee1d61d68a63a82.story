People are taking fewer holidays, according to a survey by travel organisation Abta.

The number of people taking a break fell from 83 per cent in 2013 to 80 per cent this year, the poll of 2,008 adults showed.

There has also been a decrease in the average number of holidays taken per person, from 3.1 trips in 2013 to 3.0 in 2014, although holidays abroad remain stable at 1.2 per person. 

The number of Britons having a holiday fell from 83 per cent in 2013 to 80 per cent this year, with only 53 per cent taking at least one holiday abroad

Those in north east England, east England and Scotland took the fewest foreign holidays per person in 2014 with Londoners and those in north west England taking the most.

This year Londoners took, on average, 3.9 breaks in the UK or abroad, up from 3.3 in 2013. 

Londoners also took the most foreign holidays per person, with 11 per cent of them taking four or more foreign holidays in the past 12 months.

This compared with just two per cent of those in east England and three per cent of those in the East Midlands taking four or more foreign holidays. 

The Welsh took the greatest number of domestic holidays, at 2.2 per person.

The poll showed that 68 per cent of people took at least one UK holiday in 2014, while 53 per cent had at least one trip overseas.

The Consumer Holiday Trends Report, released at the annual Abta Travel Convention were published in the Slovenian capital Ljubljana.

Abta is the leading association of travel agents and tour operators.

The poll showed that 20 per cent of people anticipate spending more on holidays in 2015 compared with 15 per cent who say they will spend less.

The number of people booking an overseas package holiday rose from 46 per cent last year to 51 per cent this year, with 41 per cent people taking a holiday both abroad and in the UK in 2014, compared with 39 per cent in 2013.

There was also an increase in holidays abroad of 1-3 nights, suggesting overseas city breaks were popular

There was also an increase in holidays abroad of 1-3 nights, with Abta suggesting that the overseas city break had performed well during the year, perhaps helped by a strong pound making short overseas breaks more affordable.

The survey showed that 35 per cent think they will take a holiday to a new country over the next 12 months, with 48 per cent saying they were quite likely or practically certain to visit a new resort or city.

Younger holidaymakers appeared the most adventurous with 49 per cent of 16-24-year-olds saying it was quite likely and a further 16 per cent saying it was certain they will go to a new destination.

But 56 per cent of over 65s and 51 per cent of 55-64-year-olds said that they would definitely not or would be unlikely to visit a new country.

Abta chief executive Mark Tanzer said: 'It is clear that despite continuing pressure on the majority of household budgets, people are still keen to preserve their main annual holiday.

'While the market was very buoyant at the start of the year with consumer confidence on the up, the late-holiday market was tougher, perhaps reflecting the broader dip in consumer confidence in July, as well as good weather in the UK in June and July which we know impacts holiday sales. 

The research shows there are reasons to be optimistic for next year.'
