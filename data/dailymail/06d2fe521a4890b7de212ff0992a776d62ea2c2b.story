'Despicable': Rebecca Oxley have been convicted to four years imprisonment for the mugging

A ‘despicable’ mugger who injured a frail grandmother while robbing her of her purse blamed the elderly victim for her injuries - because she refused to let go.

Vile heroin addict Rebecca Oxley, 36, pulled 75-year-old Irene Bracewell to the floor as she tried to run away with her wallet after asking the pensioner for her spare change.

The victim tried to cling onto her purse but fell flat on her face and was left stricken on the floor as Ms Oxley ran off with the item containing just £15.

Career-criminal Oxley was caught by two passers-by who witnessed the incident who chased after her and clung onto her until police arrived.

Mrs Bracewell suffered grazes to her knees as a result of the attack.

When arrested Ms Oxley showed ‘no remorse’ and told police that Mrs Bracewell’s injuries were her own fault ‘for not letting go’.

A drug addict for over 20 years shameful Oxley was tried at Burnley Crown Court, where it was revealed she had 58 previous convictions - mainly for theft – including robbing a 60-year-old man, looting a 92-year old man’s home and stealing distant relative’s purse after they met by chance at hospital. She had also stolen from charity shops.

Oxley of Smith Street, Nelson, pleaded guilty to robbery and was jailed for four years.

The incident occurred last March after Mrs Bracewell had gone into Nelson town centre shopping at 9am because she thought it would be quiet.

Sarah Statham, prosecuting, said the victim had just been to the cash machine and had her purse in her hand.

As she was on a pedestrian crossing, Oxley approached the elderly woman for change.

When Mrs Bracewell declined Oxley ‘using a lot of force’ tried to grab her purse and Mrs Bracewell struggled and was pulled over.

She fell face forward in the middle of the road as Oxley made off with the purse.

Eyewitness David Smith was driving his van past when he saw the robbery. He chased Oxley and was joined by David Marshall and together they caught her and ensured she remained until police arrived at the scene.

It was explained to the court that Oxley had had a significant heroin problem for 20 years, had been desperate for cash and accepted she had ‘sunk as low as she had done’ to behave as she did and that she apologised to the victim.

In mitigation, Richard Taylor, for Oxley added that she was ‘inadequate in many ways and pathetic in the true sense of the word’.

Sentencing, Judge Beverley Lunt told Oxley she had a ‘dreadful record’ and said of the victim: ‘She was left shocked, she was left hurt, she was left bleeding and you just didn’t care. You ran away.’

Judge Lunt made rewards of £250 each from public funds for Mr Smith and Mr Marshall for their ‘bravery and public spiritedness’ in intervening and detaining Oxley.

After the case Detective Constable Dave Greenwood of Lancashire Police said: ‘Oxley targeted and preyed on an elderly and vulnerable member of the public.‘She showed no remorse for her despicable actions and I am pleased with the sentence she has been given.

‘I would like to praise the bravery shown by the members of the public who chased after Oxley. Their courageous actions undoubtedly helped officers to make a quick arrest and secure a successful conviction at court.

‘The local community should be proud that people like this live amongst them. They showed true compassion and should be commended for their actions.’
