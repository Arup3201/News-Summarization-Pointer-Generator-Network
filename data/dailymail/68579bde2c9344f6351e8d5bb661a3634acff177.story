Preparations were well underway today for keeping Britain’s
motorists moving this winter as Highways Agency gritters were loaded up with rock
salt.

One barn with 5,000 tonnes of rocksalt was seen in
Leatherhead, Surrey, while a beautiful set of photographs emerged of autumn's wonderful
colours.

But the images - taken at Sheffield Park in Uckfield, Sussex, and Kew Gardens in South-West London - come ahead of a fall in temperatures next week.

Autumn's colours are showing later in the season this year due to a record cold spring, and a chilly start to the week from next Monday is forecast.

Met Office forecaster Nicola Maxey 
said that temperatures would dip below the average November maximum for 
Britain of 9.1C, or 9.9C for England.

Preparations: A gritting truck loading up with rocksalt is driven by Dave Humble, who has worked the Highways Agency for 25 years, at the depot in Leatherhead, Surrey

Arms up: Mark Peers, service delivery manager for Connect Plus, stands with 5,000 tonnes of rocksalt in the Leatherhead depot's barn - one of seven servicing the M25

Beautiful scenery: This could be the last chance to witness the wonderful autumn colours seen here at Sheffield Park in Uckfield, East Sussex

Worth a picture: People stand on a bridge and walk on the grass as they make the most of the autumn colours on display at Sheffield Park in Uckfield

What a sight: The bridge at Sheffield Park - which is located just east of Haywards Heath - is a popular feature from which to witness the spectacular autumn colours

Popular attraction: Sheffield Park, a National Trust site, is often very busy during the autumn colour season as people flock to view the beautiful gardens

She
told MailOnline: 'We’re looking at a degree or two below average for the
time of year - the further north you go - Scotland and northern 
England.

‘But when you start
getting down to Bristol, Heathrow and Plymouth in the south, they're 
hovering around the average for November.

‘As
we go into the rest of the week the cold is going to affect the
rest of the country. We're looking at perhaps slightly below average 
temperatures.’

And forecasters predicted snow would fall next Monday at Aviemore in the Cairngorms in the Scottish Highlands, where temperatures will drop to -8C.

Tonight will see showers over northern East Anglia clear through the evening, leaving a largely dry night for most of Britain.

Three-day forecast: Tomorrow, it will be largely dry throughout the UK with sunny spells for most of England and Wales and the east of Ireland and Scotland

Capturing the moment: A visitor to the Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew takes a close-up photograph of a tree at the tourist attraction in South-West London

Going for a stroll: Visitors walk through Kew Gardens where autumn's colours are showing later in the season this year due to a record cold spring

Tidying up: A worker uses a blower to clear up fallen leaves at Kew Gardens, which claims to be London's only 300-acre Unesco World Heritage site

Relaxing walk: A man makes his way through Kew Gardens, which was founded in 1759, and declared a Unesco World Heritage Site in 2003

Centrepiece: A visitor at Kew Gardens walks towards the Pagoda, which was completed in 1762. The ten-storey octagonal structure is 163ft high

There
will be clear spells except on the western coasts of Scotland, Ireland 
and Wales, with a moderate-to-fresh north-westerly wind.

Tomorrow,
it will be largely dry throughout the UK with sunny spells for most of 
England and Wales and the east of Ireland and Scotland.

There
will be plenty of cloud in western Scotland and Ireland with patchy 
drizzle through the day and gentle to moderate variable winds.

On
Saturday there will be sunny spells for most, before a band of rain 
moves south eastwards from northern Scotland through the evening.

Magnificent scene: The sun rises behind The Shard from Millennium Bridge over the River Thames in Central London in the morning

The rain will be light and patchy and there will be gentle to moderate winds in the south, stronger in the north of Scotland.

On Sunday the rain will slowly clear leaving it feeling colder with sunny spells and gentle-to-moderate variable winds for most.

The Environment Agency had three flood alerts out today, including one on the Suffolk coast from Lowestoft to Bawdsey.

The other two were on the North Sea coast from Whitby to Filey, including Scarborough, and on the Somerset coast at Porlock Weir.

More than a third of motorists are anxious about driving in the deteriorating weather - with one in ten admitting to being frightened, a study said today.

Nearly one in five motorists will perform no checks at all on their vehicle in preparation for winter, whilst 40 per cent are planning to build a snowman.

Around a quarter of drivers feel that checks are unnecessary, and 44 per cent cited not knowing what to check as the reason for their inactivity.

Of those who do intend to make preparations for the winter, almost half are waiting until the temperatures become noticeably colder.

The survey by garage chain Halfords Autocentres was carried out to check how prepared motorists are for the bad weather.

A spokesman said: 'Energy bills and festive treats mean that car maintenance becomes a lower priority as people attempt to save money.

‘However, this is a false economy because it increases the risk of potential damage to a vehicle as well as the likely repair costs to rectify it.’
