The homeless man accused of shoving a student in front of a train yesterday appeared in court this morning rambling incoherently about people trying to kill him and seeing 'colors and darkness'.

Hunter College student Maya Leggat, 21, received horrific injuries after she was shoved on to the tracks at White Plains station in New York, allegedly because she refused to give money to Howard J. Mickens, 39.

Shocked commuters described seeing her mangled legs on the tracks, and some followed the panhandler and held him until police arrived.

He was charged with attempted murder and made a bizarre appearance in court today saying he was 'guilty with an explanation'.

Victim: Maya Leggat, 21, was standing on the northbound platform of the White Plains station at 11:05am on Wednesday when the 39-year-old homeless man came up from behind and shoved her on to the tracks

Help: The empty train struck Maya as commuters looked on in horror and
MTA cops, who were already at the station, scrambled down the tracks to rescue and calm her

Maya is in stable condition at Westchester
Medical Center in Valhalla and is facing surgery after sustaining 
serious leg trauma, her brother told The Journal News.

Mickens appeared before White Plains 
City Court Judge Eric Press, who ordered him to undergo a psychiatric 
evaluation in the attempted murder case.

'Can you make sure they’re not 
military?' the 39-year-old askedabout his potential evaluators and when his lawyer 
advised him to be quiet, he ignored her and told the judge: 'I don't 
trust her. Sir, I am guilty with an explanation.'

When he was asked if he understood what was happening to him, he said: 'No disrespect, judge. I just don’t want to get railroaded, especially by 
individuals who have been trying to kill me since I was a child.

'When I 
close my eyes I see colors and darkness.'

The case was adjourned until October 25.

Horror: A 21-year-old student was pushed under a train at White Plains in New York

Gary Waxman, who runs a news stand at the station, told CBS New York: 'She refused to give him money and he pushed her in front of a train. Fingers were gone, legs were mangled - that’s what I heard from police.'

He said Mickens was someone he regularly encountered while working as he would often stand outside the station and ask passersby for change and cigarettes. 

Metro North railway police are viewing surveillance footage.

Maya, who studies at Hunter College, was conscious when police arrived and was able to describe the attack.

An officer went on to the track and comforted the 21-year-old, who had been on her way to New York City, while they waited for an ambulance.

No passengers were on the train that hit the young woman.

According to The Journal News, Mickens has 11 previous arrests with a criminal record dating back more than two decades.

He has served three state prison sentences for first-degree robbery, second-degree assault and fifth-degree criminal possession of a controlled substance, all felonies, state Department of Corrections records show.

Mickens has a lengthy criminal record, including five alleged violent felonies, according to Lohud.com.

Mr Waxman said Mickens had been begging at the station for several months. 'He stands out in front and asks for money ... Today he decided he was going to flip out and do something,' he said.

The victim's brother told ABC 7: 'I'm just thankful that she's alive,' adding that her condition was stable and she was due to have surgery.
