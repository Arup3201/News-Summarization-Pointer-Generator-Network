You will have to fork out a few beans if you fancy this chocolate as it is said to be the world's most expensive bar.  

To'ak chocolate, which translated to 'earth' and 'tree' in ancient Ecuadorian dialects, costs a whopping $260 (£169) per bar.

Despite its hefty price tag the handmade treat is surprisingly light, in fact it is so delicate that each bar weighs just 1.5 ounces.

The To'ak chocolate bar is said to be the world's most expensive pure chocolate bar costing £169

It is eaten using wooden tongs, or tasting utensils, so that it is easier to perceive the chocolate's aroma on the nose.

The creators of the snack say that one of the reasons for To'ak's price tag is that 95 per cent of chocolate is made using mass-produced beans, whereas their chocolate comes from the remaining five per cent, known as fine grade cacao.

Each step towards making the bar - which is 81 per cent cacao mass and the rest sugar - is meticulous, requiring 36 steps to make the bar.

Producers of the bar say it's high price is due to its 85 per cent grade cacao as opposed to ordinary chocolate that only contains fiver per cent 

Rare cacao seeds are first harvested from the coast of Ecuador, before they are fermented and turned into liquid chocolate.

This liquid chocolate is then hand-moulded and a single, hand-selected, hand-measured and shelled cacao bean is placed in the centre - this must fit perfectly and measure between 7mm and 8mm.

Though there are other chocolates out there with higher price tags, To'ak claim their chocolate is the most expensive pure chocolate - with no expensive additions.

Jerry Toth, co-founder of To'ak, says that their approach to chocolate is similar to that of other luxury food products with high price tags. 

'We make chocolate with the same care and precision as we know it from fine wine and premium small batch whiskey.'

Carl Schweizer, co-founder of To'ak, added: 'It is the most expensive pure dark chocolate in the world without any fancy stuff like gold leaves or diamonds in it to increase its value.

'We produce our chocolate in the country of origin and focus a single origin that sums only 14 small farmers.

'Being so small permits us to be 100% involved in absolutely every step of making chocolate: from earth to tree to bean to bar.'
