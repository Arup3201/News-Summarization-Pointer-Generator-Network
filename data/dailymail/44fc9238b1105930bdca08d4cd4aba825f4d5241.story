This footage captures the nail-biting moment a dangerously triple-stacked lorry leans treacherously to one side as its driver attempts to navigate a busy roundabout at speed.

Nervous motorists attempted to keep their distance as the vehicle, carrying three skips, shifted one way then the next - appearing to come terrifyingly close to toppling.

One driver said the lorry went so fast that the wheels appeared to lift off the ground as it shot over two roundabouts.

Horror: A driver on the outside lane of the roundabout in Kent attempts to keep their distance as the triple-stacked skip lorry leans perilously to one side

Duncan Pout, 37, who filmed the incident in Thanet, Kent, said: 'I followed it round the first roundabout and it went over that far the tyres were off the ground.

'I decided to video just in case it was a You've Been Framed sketch.'

He posted the startling video on Facebook where Matt Hurley commented: 'Plain right dangerous. Both driver and company should be fined.'

Kristian Toogood added: 'That's insane, looks like the car on the roundabout had a lucky escape!'

Jade Wallis said: 'The top skip shouldn't have even been allowed on. If that falls off then it could have caused a hell of bad things!' 

Mario Campion, 57, who runs A-Skip4U, defended his driver - but said he would tell him not to stack the skips so high in future.

Unbelievable: The lorry's huge load towers into the air as it approaches the roundabout 

And he even accused the motorist who filmed the footage of dangerous driving.

He said: 'It looks high, and I've instructed the worker driving the lorry not to stack it that high again, but it does not exceed the legal weight or height limit.

'We use a compressor to push the waste so the skip on top can squash in.

'In this case it was bulky wood which does not compress, but he put all three on there anyway so the skips were stacked higher.

'There were also four chains pulling the skips down. No wheels came off the ground.

Nerve-wracking: As the lorry approaches the roundabout at speed it turns to the left causing the three precariously-loaded skips to shift to the right

Dangerous: One driver, Duncan Pout, 37, filmed the scene on his phone and claims that the lorry's tyres actually lifted off the ground 

'He could have been going a bit slower around the roundabout but air suspension stops too much tipping and the skips were hydraulically chained and pulled down.

'The person who took the video ought to think about his own actions. He was using a mobile phone at the wheel which is dangerous.

'I've been running this business since 1984 and never had a lorry tip over.'

A spokesman for Kent Police said that they are not investigating the incident.
