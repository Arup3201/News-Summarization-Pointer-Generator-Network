A new meme was born last night, once again at the expense of Miami Heat star forward LeBron James.

The meme, #LeBroning, is flooding social media in response to James being carried off of the court in the waning minutes of the first game of the NBA Finals versus the San Antonio Spurs on Thursday.

The game, played in San Antonio, was heated from the start when the air conditioning failed at the AT&T Center. Temperatures skyrocketed as high as 88 degrees, with players and fans alike struggling to cope with the conditions

James, who was experiencing visible difficulty in dealing with the sweltering temperature, was carried off of the court by team staff due to cramping issues. The Spurs then rallied, winning the game 110-95.

Following the game, fans took to social media to joke about the incident, giving birth to the meme. According to analytics from hashtags.org, Twitter users utilizing the hashtag spiked late Thursday night, with an estimated 13,600 users per hour adopting it.

Pictures using the meme often showed people being carried by the friends in a manner similar to James leaving the court.

Not to be outdone, some bigger names got involved with the frenzy. In a tweet mid-game last night. Gatorade joked on King James, the sports-drink giant replying to question about their 'sports science magic' preventing James' cramps with 'The person cramping wasn't our client. Our athletes can take the heat.'

Gatorade has since apologized for the tweet, although it can still be found on their page.

'I did everything that I needed to do to prepare for this game,' said James in a statement Friday. 'I was angry in 
the fact that I couldn't help my team get over the hump. In a huge Game 
1, I wanted to make a statement.'

When asked about the #LeBroning craze, James replied 'This is about the Spurs and the Heat, and it's not about everybody 
else. I don't care.'

James finished the game with 25 points, six rebounds, three assists and three steals. He was helped by guard Dwyane Wade, who contributed 19 points in the effort.

Despite the flood of tweets mocking the star, some came out in support of him. In an article published Friday, music mag Rolling Stone came to James' defense, calling the online reaction to James' cramping 'the worst.'

This recent incident is not LeBron's first foray into going viral. Prior to this, the hashtag #lebroning was used to describe choking under pressure, or faking an injury, both criticisms leveled at the star over the course of his career.

The Spurs announced Friday that the air-conditioning issues at the arena have been fixed. The problem was blamed on an electrical failure at the arena.

Game 2 of the NBA Finals is scheduled to take place in San Antonio at 8pm on Sunday.
