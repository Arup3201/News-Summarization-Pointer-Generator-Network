An investigation has been launched after millions of dead shrimp were washed ashore close to two coal-fired power stations on the coast of Chile, turning the beach bright red.

Environmental officials say they are investigating after dead the creatures appeared on a beach in the town of Coronel, some 330 miles south of the capital, Santiago.

Local fishermen have blamed the Bocamina 1 and 2 plants owned by regional power generator Endesa, and the Santa Maria plant controlled by Chilean power company Colbun, which they say have heated the waters, endangering their livelihood.

'I'm 69 years old and started fishing when I was nine but, as a fisherman, I never saw a disaster of this magnitude,' Gregorio Ortega told local Radio Bio Bio.

Hundreds of dead crabs also washed up in the same area over the weekend.

'We're going to be collecting as much evidence as possible to determine if this is an environmental crime,' Ana Maria Aldana, prosecutor for environmental crimes, told state television.

An official at Colbun declined to comment. A spokesman for Endesa said the company was aware of the issue and would issue a statement later.Chile's energy intensive mining industry is clamouring for more power.

Some analysts say the country must triple its capacity in just 15 years, despite having no domestic oil or natural gas.

Chile imports 97 per cent of its fossil fuels and depends largely on hydropower for electricity, creating a crisis when droughts drain reservoirs or far-away disputes affect fuel imports.

Most Chileans oppose plans to develop a project to power central Chile by damming Patagonian rivers, fearing environmental damage. The HidroAysen venture is 51per cent owned by Endesa and 49 per cent owned by Colbun. Some protests against the project have turned violent.
