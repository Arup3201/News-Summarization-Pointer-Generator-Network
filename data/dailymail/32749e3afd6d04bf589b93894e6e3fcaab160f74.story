The former leader of the English Defence League is to tour schools to lecture children on tolerance, it emerged today.

Tommy Robinson, who quit the party last year because of its 'extremist elements', wants to help prepare young students for adult life.

The 30-year-old, who has convictions for assault, drug and public order offences, has pledged to help tackle racism in Britain since he left the far right party.

He is set to start his tour shortly, but the decision to allow into schools has sparked outrage from parents.

'Given this 
man's appalling record for thuggery and his history of inciting racial 
tension, it beggars belief that he is being ushered into classrooms,' one told the Mirror.

'What on Earth has he got to say that's worth our children hearing? He should just crawl under a rock and keep quiet.'

Mr Robinson, whose real name is Stephen Yaxley-Lennon, left the EDL last October, and has received numerous death threats.

He said that he was sorry for creating an 'us and them' culture and for causing fear among British Muslims.

He claimed 'every single Muslim' was to blame for 'getting away' with the July 7 bombings.

Robinson has been mentored by deradicalisation thinktank, the Quilliam Foundation, since he quit his post.

'Having facilitated his departure from the EDL, he
continues to attend our classes to learn more about Islamist extremism,' a spokesman said today.

One of the first visits was to be the Duchess Community High 
School in Alnwick, Northumberland, but they have now cancelled.

Head of religious education Louis Spence told the Mirror: 'By inviting visitors as diverse as Tommy Robinson, students are. There is a moral courage in thinking through difficult issues, 
standing up for what you believe in, whilst still showing respect and 
humanity.'

Mr Robinson, who was also a BNP member, founded the EDL in 2009 because he was angry that Muslims demonstrated as British troops returned from Afghanistan.

He has been arrested at various demonstrations and was jailed for using someone else's passport to fly to America.

A convicted football hooligan, he was also arrested in May 2012, after allegedly obstructing police as he tried to get close to the spot in Woolwich where Lee Rigby was murdered.

Since he left the EDL he has said that his past inflammatory statements had often been fuelled by alcohol and the adrenaline 
rush of 'leading the biggest street protest movement in Europe.'

Giving reason for his decision to leave the group, Mr Robinson
 said he had been sobered by his 18-week stint in prison and by the 
experience of being shunned by parents when picking up his children at 
school.

Discussing the school's cancellation, he told 
the BBC Asian Network: 'The school thought it was beneficial and after 
pressure and probably intimidation they have cancelled, which is no more
 than I would have expected.

'I was asked to speak at Oxford University, but they had to cancel due to threats.

'Am I the right person to do it? Have I got a past? Yes. Am I proud of some of those things? No I'm not.

'There are plenty of people in schools who have been in trouble with the law'.
