Apple has released a total of eight iPhone handsets since 2007 and each one has been released with the promise of faster speeds and improved performance.

But how different is the original model to the current 5S?

Fan site EverythingApplePro has created a video test of all eight handsets, from the original to the new model, plus the 3G, 3GS, 4, 4S, 5 and 5C.

Each of the handsets were 'freshly restored and not jailbroken' meaning they each had the same default settings and all applications were force closed beforehand. 

Apple's new software has been slammed for causing users to feel sick.

Features on software including zooming screens and app windows, full-screen slide transitions, a 'faux-3D parallax effect' on the home screen.

As the phone is tilted, the icons appear to move independently from the wallpaper.

Stuff magazine investigated the effects these motion-based features had on users and discovered claims of nausea, motion sickness and even vertigo. 

In the first test, all the phones were powered off simultaneously and the 3GS shut down fastest, followed by 3G, then the 4, then the original model.

The newer handsets all took noticeably longer than the older models, but took exactly the same amount of time as each other, to the second.

The voiceover explained during the video that iOS 6 had a much faster shut down time than iOS 7 and this was highlighted in the test.

Each of the phones booted up at different times, but EverythingApplePro highlights that the models differ in the amount of processing power and RAM and software between the newest and oldest phones, meaning this was not unexpected.

The newer models all booted up first, and at almost the same time, yet the original phone booted up faster than the iPhone 4. Apple's iPhone 3G was the slowest to boost.

In the final tests, EverythingApplePro launched the Reddit.com, and Apple.com websites.

The male voiceover explained that the 5S loads sites 'instantaneously' adding: 'the extra processing power and the new Wi-Fi capabilities, its an amazing device'.

When launching Reddit.com, the iPhone 5 beat the 5 and the voiceover continued the loading times go 'downhill' from there.

In conclusion, the video maker claimed: 'I learnt that the amount of processing power is greater as the generation goes on, but it's marginally less noticeable the higher you go, so if you have a 5 I wouldn't really recommend upgrading to a 5S just based on the fact you want extra amount of power, because it has an amazing amount of power as it is.'

When launching Reddit.com, the iPhone 5 beat the 5C but the rest of the handsets loaded the page slower than its successor

In a separate test, SquareTrade, a provider of protection
plans for gadgets, compared five smartphones, including Apple's new 
iPhones, to see if they could withstand drops, dunks and other common 
hazards.

It found 
that while the iPhone 5C and 5S scored similar on the 'Breakability' 
scale, the latest models aren't as durable as last year's iPhone 5.

The
biggest loser, however, was Samsung's Galaxy S4, which failed to work 
after being submerged in water and being dropped 5 feet off the ground, 
according to San Francisco-based SquareTrade.

The phone that withstood SquareTrade's torture test best was Google's Moto X.

New research by SquareTrade reveals that the iPhone 5s & 5c were outshone by their predecessor, the iPhone 5, and the Samsung Galaxy S4.
