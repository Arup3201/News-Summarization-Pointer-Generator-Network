Following the array of hilarious #maccasfail photos which have been splashed across social media showing the fast food chains' mishaps and muck-ups, a new series of failures have come to light.

Dubbed #supermarket fail, images snapped by unimpressed customers show one cent discounts, alcohol advertised as a a back to school special - possibly for the parents - and suspiciously named sandwiches.

Cupcakes without icing from supermarket giant Coles, and 'Washed & Ready to use' lettuce from Woolworth which looks less than clean have also popped up under the comical hashtag.

One user found a bottle shop advertising wine as a back to school special with the caption 'Back to school today? Make sure you pack you lunchbox with grapes!'

Another was puzzled by the placement of this security stick hastagging the photo #supermarketfail

This savvy customer wasn't fooled by the 'discount' on this bottle of alcohol

Adding to the so-called fails are bananas labelled simply as 'curved yellow fruit' and a security sticker placed in a very unfortunate place on the front of a CD.

Confused, frustrated and surprised and amused customers have shared all these photos and more across social media, most simply poking fun at the retailers' mistakes rather than anger.

On the McDonald's front slices of cheese served outside the bun, meatless burgers, unusually small ice cream sundaes and poor presentation are among the 'failures' of the fast food chain that have enraged Australian customers.

Woolworths' 'Washed & Ready to use' spinach didn't look so clean according to one person

Despite the lack of icing this Coles customer admitted she still at the whole pack of cupcakes

This supermarket seemed to have forgotten the name of a very common fruit

This Twitter user wasn't convinced The Blind Side was a romantic comedy and suggested the supermarket watch the movies before selling them

One coles customer got a little less than she bargained for when this sweet treat turned out to be hollow inside

The so-called fast food dinner dramas have led to some taking to Twitter and Facebook with their dining disasters and posting under the #maccasfail hashtag.

Customer photos and amusing comments have inundated social media, drawing attention to various slip ups from McDonalds' stores and staff.

One of them is a woman who ordered a soft serve ice cream 'in a cup not a cone'. She allegedly got more than she bargained for when staff simply placed the ice cream and cone inside a sundae cup.

Among the complaints on the #maccasfail hashtag is the Facebook user who was outraged by the size of his sundaes

This woman who ordered a soft serve ice cream 'in a cup not a cone'. This is what she claims she got.

This woman's son won a free chicken wrap voucher at his school. 'Check out his prize. Thanks Maccas #Fail #Maccasfail',' she tweeted

A plain cheeseburger does not mean a burger without the meat, argued this #maccasfail customer

To the amusement of one customer at an inner-Sydney store, he was told by a young female staff member that 'McDonald's Camperdown doesn't serve red meat'.

'I bet poor girl serving gets sick of explaining that 2 disgruntled carnivores!' he tweeted.

A man who had been waiting in line at a McDonalds' store for 10 minutes says the girls standing behind him were outrageously served first.

'How's this for disappointment - half a piece of cheese! Half a piece of cheese! I am outraged McDonalds,' a woman posted alongside this photo of her burger

It took this man one bite before he realised he was missing an essential part of his cheeseburger ... the beef patty

Needless to say this man was less than impressed with the way his burger was presented to him

'Thanks for the burger McDonalds' was all this man had to say when he tucked into his food

'Yes they were hot... oh wait now I see why #maccasfail,' he tweeted.

A boy who won a free chicken wrap voucher at his school was given just a piece of chicken that took up a quarter of the entire wrap.

'How's this for disappointment - half a piece of cheese! Half a piece of cheese! I am outraged McDonalds,' a woman posted alongside a photo of her burger.

This man declared #maccasfail war when he realised he'd been given a half-empty fries

A woman was highly amused to find her bit-sized muffin needed a huge bag to hold it

He ordered a sausage and egg McMuffin, so when he bit into this he knew there was something noticeably missing

'The tide is out' according to this customer, who wasn't given a full cup of coke

This was a so-called #maccasfail for not looking anything like the picture
