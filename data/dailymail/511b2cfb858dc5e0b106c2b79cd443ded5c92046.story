Tottenham fear Hugo Lloris will snub the club's attempts to sign him to a new long-term contract this summer.

And the club are interested in England keeper Fraser Forster as they prepare for the possibility of life without the Frenchman.

Lloris' existing contract expires in 2016, but Spurs are keen to extend his deal this summer to safeguard their No 1's future and value.

On his way: Hugo Lloris (centre) could leave Tottenham this summer after two seasons at the club

The France keeper can start 
negotiating with clubs regarding a free transfer away from White Hart 
Lane in 18 months, a scenario Tottenham want to avoid.

However, Lloris is undecided on his future and wants to weigh up his options after the World Cup.

'My
 future? It's a good question. I want to concentrate on the World Cup 
and deal with my future after,' he said earlier this week.

New
 manager Mauricio Pochettino wants to hold crunch talks with Lloris at 
the earliest opportunity to get a clearer picture of his intentions.

The 27-year-old is keen to play Champions League football, something Spurs cannot offer him next season.

In demand: Tottenham want to sign Fraser Forster who is going to the World Cup with England

Paris Saint-Germain are interested in signing Lloris, a move that is likely to appeal to the shot-stopper.

Tottenham will not let Lloris leave cheaply, however, and will demand in excess of £20million for France's No 1.

The uncertainty over Lloris future has led the club to start looking at possible replacements.

Celtic
 keeper Forster is a target should Lloris leave, while Newcastle's Tim 
Krul has also been watched extensively by club scouts.

Talent: Forster has impressed with his performances for Celtic as he helped them to win the Scottish title

Option: Tottenham could also consider a move for Newcastle and Holland keeper Tim Krul
