A family of seven and their pet puppy have been rescued from a serious house fire, after a car parked on their drive was set ablaze in a suspected arson attack.

Mohammed Noman was rescued along with his wife Andleeb Kanwal, 28, and three daughters: Shagufta, nine, Aliza, six, and Laila, two, from their home in Rochdale, Greater Manchester. 

The 26-year-old gas engineer's mother Rehana Kausar, 47, and brother Mohammed Arsan, 23, were also led to safety at around 3.30am today after the blaze spread through the property.  

His father was abroad on holiday at the time. 

Mr Noman said: 'I am just completely lost for words. I am still in a state of shock, I just want to get to the bottom of what has happened.

'You never prepare for something like this or imagine that it will happen to you. I just don't know what to do.' 

He added: 'We were all very lucky to escape unharmed but it is just the damage the house and my brother's car. There is just nothing left of the car, it's a shell. He is devastated.

'My three daughters didn't know what was going on, it was such a shock for them and they were crying and worrying about what was happening.

'The downstairs windows have all shattered, the frames have melted and the living room needs to be completely gutted but it could have been worse.

'I am going to have to take some time off work to get everything sorted out and to make sure the house is safe to live in and that we have all of the amenities we need. 

Mr Noman, a 26-year-old gas engineer, said: 'I am just completely lost for words. I am still in a state of shock'

The blaze started in a Volkswagen Golf parked underneath a window sill and rapidly tore through the house

'We are hoping to move back in straight away - we have nowhere else to go.

He added he is now trying to contact the insurers for the property - as the house belongs to his parents - to make sure any repairs can be done to allow them to return home.
