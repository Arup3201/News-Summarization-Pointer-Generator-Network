Allegations: Alison Smith, pictured, has vowed to make a formal complaint against Lord Rennard

A former Liberal Democrat activist is one of 'several women' believed to have called a police hotline about the party's former chief executive Lord Rennard. 

University lecturer Alison Smith claims to have suffered an incident 'more serious than having a hand placed on her knee' in 2007.  

Ms Smith said in a statement: 'I can confirm that I have just spoken to the confidential police hotline regarding Lord Rennard.'

Meanwhile, it was claimed by Sky News that several women' had contacted the hotline.

Ms Smith added: 'The Police are very keen to deal with the matter discreetly, and I agree it is important that other people coming forward should be able to do so without fear of being caught up in the current media storm. 

'In addition, it is important that the allegations against Lord Rennard are now dealt with through formal processes.'

Ms Smith said she decided to 'blow the whistle' about the peer's alleged behaviour because he had started to become involved again in training events. 'We were told he was not going to make a comeback, now here he is, turning up all over the place,' she told BBC News.

Ms Smith, then a party activist but now an Oxford University politics lecturer, told how she and a fellow female Lib Dem member were invited back to Lord Rennard’s house after having dinner with him in central London six years ago.

She also revealed the ‘Kafkaesque’ nightmare she experienced when trying to report the incident to Lib Dem high command. Describing the alleged sexual impropriety, Ms Smith said: ‘At first everything seemed fine. He was on one sofa and we were on another sofa.

Denial: Lord Rennard has insisted that the claims made against him are untrue

‘And then he just very suddenly got up and plonked himself between us  and started moving his hands down our backs and places where they had  absolutely no business being. It was both of us at the same time.

‘I straight away stood up and said: “No, that’s not acceptable. I’m going home”.’

Miss Smith claimed he tried to tell her there were no taxis, but said she got ‘very, very, very cross’ and insisted on leaving.

‘He looked surprised, he looked shocked and he opened the door and we got a taxi home.’

But Ms Smith said that when she tried to report him she faced numerous obstacles.

She explained: ‘You have to remember that Chris Rennard was chief executive and director of campaigns. The guy who is the problem is at the top of the tree.’

Lord Rennard, who stepped down as chief executive on health grounds, has said he is ready to 'co-operate with any properly-constituted inquiry' into allegations of inappropriate behaviour. The peer has issued a series of strenuous denials of any wrongdoing.

Lib Dem leader Nick Clegg's handling of the affair has been repeatedly called into question.

An initial response from the party suggested that he was not aware of the allegations but the party leader later admitted he had known of general concerns. He conceded yesterday that his party made 'very serious mistakes' in failing to deal properly with complaints made about the peer.

And during a visit to the Aston Martin car factory in Warwickshire today, he told reporters that he wanted the investigations into Lord Rennard's alleged behaviour carried out ‘as quickly as possible’.

‘The key thing, not least for the 
women involved, is that the investigations get their work done as 
quickly as possible,’ he said.

‘The important thing is that the two 
investigations I announced last week are allowed to get on with their 
work, and that the police investigation is allowed to get on with its 
work.

‘It's crucial we get to the bottom of the truth and do that as soon as possible. That's why the investigations should proceed as quickly as possible.’

Scotland Yard has met senior Liberal Democrats to investigate whether any criminal activity has taken place and the party has launched two internal inquiries.

Both Scotland Yard and the Lib Dem party refused to comment on whether more women had come forward to make allegations against the peer.

A Lib Dem spokesman said this morning: We're not going to give a running commentary on who has spoken to who or how many people, all the details will come out in an inquiry in due course.'

The Metropolitan Police said they were ‘not prepared to discuss’ claims that officers are poised to interview a number of women, who are said to have called a dedicated hotline, in the next few days.
