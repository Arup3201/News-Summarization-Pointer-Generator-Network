Ex Cleveland chief constable Sean Price received £336,000 after being dismissed

Two former senior police officers have received £467,000 in pension payments - despite being sacked for gross misconduct.

Ex-Cleveland chief constable Sean Price and his deputy Derek Bonnard received £336,000 and £131,000 respectively after being dismissed.

Both
 officers were arrested in 2011 as part of Operation Sacristy, the £4.6m
 investigation into allegations of corruption at the force and the 
now-defunct police authority which resulted in no criminal charges.

Mr Price was fired in 2012 after a hearing which found he had lied about his role in the recruitment of the former police authority chairman Dave McLuckie's daughter.

In March, Mr Bonnard was dismissed in March after six counts of gross misconduct were upheld, including the misuse of a corporate credit card.

Both men had denied any wrongdoing.

The officers were entitled to the payments under the terms of their contracts.

A police spokeswoman said the strict rules that determine when a pension can be forfeited are set out in law.

'To be considered, a person has to be convicted in court of specific criminal offences. These are: treason, offences under the Official Secrets Act with a sentence of at least ten years, or a criminal offence connected to service which is liable to lead to serious loss of public confidence, or is gravely injurious to the interests of the Secretary of State.

Forfeiture proceedings have to be approved by the Home Secretary.

'Revocation or reduction of pensionable pay can therefore only occur if an officer is convicted in court of one of these criminal offences.

'It cannot be applied to police officers who are dismissed for misconduct or who choose to resign facing a misconduct hearing.'

Details of their pension payments were revealed following a Freedom of Information request.

The force said chief constable Jacqui Cheer and police and crime commissioner Barry Coppinger had both raised the matter but there was no indication the government planned to change the regulations.

Derek Bonnard received £131,000 after being dismissed after six counts of gross misconduct against him were upheld, including the misuse of a corporate credit card

Mr Price said: 'I was in the police service for nearly 33 years rising from the rank of constable to chief constable.

'During that time paid up to 11 per cent of my salary into my pension fund, as do all other police officers.'

The former chief constable said he was still looking forward to clearing his name.

'A number of witnesses have now approached me who could not help at the time, due to restrictions placed upon them by the Operation Sacristy criminal investigation, which cost £5m of taxpayers money and was ultimately completely ill founded and unsuccessful.

Both officers were arrested in 2011 as part of Operation Sacristy, the £4.6m investigation into allegations of corruption at the Cleveland Police and the now-defunct police authority which resulted in no criminal charges

'Statements are in the process of being obtained from these witnesses. The legal advice I have received is that is that this new evidence "was not or could not have been considered by the misconduct panel at the time" and provides grounds to appeal against my dismissal, even after the time that has passed.'

Mr Bonnard said: 'As is the case for all police officers I made payments into the pension scheme throughout my career. The pension I receive is set by national police pension regulations'.

Stockton
 South MP James Wharton said: 'It is clear that Operation Sacristy has 
been an expensive and disruptive failure which appears to have started 
with the right intentions, but then got badly out of hand.

'Cleveland Police needs to demonstrate it has learned lessons but I fear a lot still needs to be done.'
