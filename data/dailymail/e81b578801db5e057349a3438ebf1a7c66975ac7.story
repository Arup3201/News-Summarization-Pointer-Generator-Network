A triple gold medal-winning cyclist is still riding his tricycle for five miles a week despite turning 100.

In 1937, Richard Howard won gold in a 24-hour road race covering 335 miles, a 200-mile race and another 100-mile road race - all in one month.

The centenarian used to go cycling with his wife Dorothy, and pedalled to work with his son Peter, now 63, on the back in the 1940s.

The father-of-one had not been on his bike for many years but was prompted to start again after the death of Dorothy who had a stroke aged 90 in 2007.

Now, Mr Howard, who does not look his age, cycles at least five miles every weekend on the tricycle and says he will carry on until he is 112.

The keen biker, from Winslow, Buckinghamshire, who turned 100 last week, said today about cycling: 'I just accept it as normal.'

On turning 100, he said: 'It's the same as I've always felt - perfectly OK.'

His son Peter, a business consultant, said: 'He must have been a really fit young man to win all those gold medals.

'I am very proud of him. It is amazing that he is still living independently now.

'He tells me he plans to live until he is 112 - and cycle for as long as possible.

'I think cycling has probably given him that foundation of fitness that has enabled him to live this long.

'I remember back in 1976 I took a photo of him with a grey beard and a beret and I thought this may be the last shot I get of my dad.

'I would never have dreamt in a month of Sundays that in 2013 I would be sitting here celebrating his 100th birthday.

'He took up cycling again after mum died to take his mind off it.'

Peter added: 'We usually go about five miles, but when the weather gets warmer, we'll go about 12 miles,' he said.

'My dad has a lot of stamina. We go along at quite a pace. People are often surprised to see someone of his age still riding.

'They often stop him and say, "That's a beautiful machine". He'll say, "You should try one of these - they're great".'

Mr Howard was born in Tottenham, north London, and was one of 12 children.

He served with the Royal Army Ordnance Corps in the Second World War looking after Italian and German prisoners of war.

Already fluent in French, he then became adept in Italian and German.

The primary school teacher retired at the age of 65, having taught in the London and Canterbury areas.

Despite his age, he still drives a car occasionally and is an accomplished painter of portraits and landscapes.

Mr Howard is still an active member of Unity Cycling Club and the Tricycle Association, and was delighted to receive birthday cards from their members.
