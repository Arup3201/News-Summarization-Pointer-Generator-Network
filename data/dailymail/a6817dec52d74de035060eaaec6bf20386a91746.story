Martin Demichelis has backed Manuel Pellegrini to get Manchester City out of their current rut, having seen the Chilean manager do so at River Plate and Malaga in the past.

Demichelis played under Pellegrini at both clubs before joining City for £4million from Atletico Madrid, and the centre-back has pointed out the 61-year-old's experience when in a 'crisis'.

City sit second in the Barclays Premier League, six points shy of pacesetters Chelsea after beating Southampton 3-0 at St Mary's.

Pellegrini admitted in early November that City were suffering 'a crisis of confidence', but Demichelis insists he is the ideal man to have when backed into a corner.

'He is a manager who is always more calm than the players,' Demichelis tells the Telegraph.

'Maybe we are too enthusiastic or excited and think less than he does, but he always finds the right answer and the right path for us.

'That is why I think he is a great group leader and manager. I have known him for a long time and we have been through difficult periods together, at River Plate and Malaga, and I am really sure he will find a way this time as well.'

Demichelis started his professional career with River Plate between 2000 and 2003, before playing for Malaga between 2011 and 2013. 

The 33-year-old admits Pellegrini taught him plenty at both when asked to give an example.

'When I arrived (at Malaga), we were fighting relegation at the bottom of the table, but then finished in 11th position and it was a lesson of life, as well as football.

'Even the mathematicians said we could not avoid relegation but in the last 11 games we won nine, drew one and lost the final one against Barcelona. For me, it was like a title without a medal because of the spirit we showed.'
