Waving her arms and yelling, this is the moment Dame Helen Mirren – dressed as the Queen – gave a band of drummers its marching orders.

The actress admitted that she must have looked like a ‘batty old woman’ as she stormed out of the theatre where she was performing and told the noisy drumming troupe to shut up.

Video footage clearly shows the Oscar-winner’s furious gesticulations as she attempted to quieten the deafening throng outside London’s Gielgud Theatre.

Making a point: Helen Mirren is pictured today in a customised t-shirt relaying her message to a drumming troupe who disturbed her performance at London's Gielgud theatre - until she told them to keep quiet

The 67-year-old star was angry they had 
disturbed the first half of her play with their drumming, designed to 
promote gay and transgender festival As One In The Park.

Speaking to the Daily Telegraph, she 
said something 'had to be done' as the noise had been getting louder and she and fellow actor Paul Ritter could barely hear each 
other speak.

She said: 'I was so upset from struggling through 
the scene with Paul that I literally walked straight off stage, straight
up the stairs and straight out the stage door and banged my way through
the crowd who were watching and said 'stop, you’ve got to stop right 
now’ only I might have used stronger language than that.

'They were very sweet and stopped the 
minute they knew I wasn’t just a batty old woman haranguing them on the 
streets of Soho on a Saturday night.'

Angry: Helen Mirren, circled, storms out of the theatre to remonstrate with revellers outside the theatre

Reports of her exact words differ, but it is clear the 67-year-old was, like Queen Victoria, not amused.

Some said she told the group to ‘shut the **** up’.

One is not amused: Helen Mirren as The Queen in play The Audience

Others said she ‘stomped out and shrieked “Quiet! I’m trying to do a play in here!” ’

Dame Helen is playing the Queen in The
Audience, a play about the monarch’s private weekly meetings with 
various prime ministers at Buckingham Palace.

Last week the role earned her an Olivier award for best actress.

The play’s writer Peter Morgan also scripted the 2006 film The Queen, for which Dame Helen won an Oscar.

Saturday night’s West End performance of the play was disturbed by the sound of drums five minutes before the interval.

A
troupe of performers marched past the theatre in a parade designed to 
promote As One In The Park, a festival for gay and transgender people 
due to take place in East London this month.

Followed by a crowd of around 200, the
musicians and dancers stopped outside a bar to perform a drum crescendo
– unaware they were drowning out Dame Helen’s lines.

Now Dame Helen has revealed she would like to invite the performers to see her play.

Audience
member Ben Scotchbrook told the Daily Mail that the actress finished 
the first half without letting the noise affect her performance.

When
the second half was interrupted by a lighting blackout, she went on 
stage and revealed she had dealt with the source of the noise.

‘She was a real pro, she saved the day,’ said Mr Scotchbrook, a 43-year-old communications consultant from Buckinghamshire.

‘The noise was really irritating, but she didn’t get ruffled on stage.

‘In the interval I went out and tried 
to ask the drummers to move on, to no effect. I don’t think they 
realised they could be heard inside the theatre. 

Too loud: The band of drummers set to promote LGBT festival As One In The Park, seen in London's Soho, close to the Gielgud Theatre, which prompted Helen Mirren to leave her performance

Queen interrupted: Dame Helen left the Gielgud Theatre in the interval to tell the drummers off

‘I went back in without realising Dame Helen had also been out. Then in the second half the performance was halted for several minutes by a technical failure.

‘Dame Helen came on stage and said, “We’re having a bad night”.

'She apologised for the noise and said, “I went outside dressed as the Queen and told them, not too politely, to ‘go away’ as they were spoiling the play”.’

Mr Scotchbrook added: ‘I have since heard that she was even less polite than we had imagined.’

Writing on Twitter, Lucy Lumsden said: ‘Brilliant – Helen Mirren, dressed as the Queen, stormed off stage last night and told a bunch of drummers to “shut the **** up”.’

Miss Lumsden could not be contacted to verify whether she heard the exchange first-hand.

One of the parade organisers said: ‘She stomped out and shrieked, “Quiet! I’m trying to do a play in here! People have paid a lot of money for tickets”.’

Yesterday a spokesman for As One In The Park offered Dame Helen a free ticket to the event to apologise for the disturbance.

Mark Williams, head of marketing at festival organiser Orange Nation, said: ‘We are terribly upset if we caused her any distress. If she’d like to attend the festival she’d be more than welcome.’

Dame Helen’s spokesman could not be contacted last night.
