Piracy charges against jailed Greenpeace activists in Russia have been dropped and they have been charged with hooliganism instead.

It means that instead of a possible 15 years imprisonment for piracy they could face seven years in jail.

There is also still the possibility they could be charged with using force against official which carries a punishment of ten year imprisonment, Greenpeace noted.

Piracy charges against the 'Arctic 30' have been dropped and replaced by hooliganism claims

The Greenpeace activists and journalists, who have been held in a Russian prison since being arrested in a protest against oil company Gazprom's platform in the Arctic's Pechora Sea last month, 'are no more hooligans than they were pirates,' according to Greenpeace.

Nothing less than the release of the detainees - dubbed The Arctic 30 - and the withdrawal of these 'trumped up' charges would be acceptable, Greenpeace argued.

'This is still a wildly disproportionate charge that carries up to seven years in jail. It represents nothing less than an assault on the very principle of peaceful protest,' a spokesman said.

'Those brave men and women went to the Arctic armed with nothing more than a desire to shine a light on a reckless business. They should be with their families, not in a prison in Murmansk.

'We will contest the trumped-up charge of hooliganism as strongly as we contested the piracy allegations. They are both fantasy charges that bear no relation to reality. The Arctic 30 protested peacefully against Gazprom's dangerous oil drilling and should be free.'

The move follows a comment by President Vladimir Putin, who said last month that he does not think the Greenpeace activists are pirates.

A group of 28 Greenpeace activists, a Russian photographer and a British videographer have been held since their ship, the Arctic Sunrise was seized by the Russian coast guard after protesting outside a Gazprom-owned oil rig September 18. A total of six Britons are being held.

The Greenpeace spokesman said: 'The Investigative Committee also say they may charge some activists with use of force against officials, carrying up to ten years in jail.

'Greenpeace has a 42 year history of entirely peaceful activism, it is a cheap libel to accuse those campaigners of doing anything other than protesting peacefully, they arrived at that oil rig in a ship painted with a dove and a rainbow.

'Our ship was seized by men with knives and guns, while the Arctic 30 raised their arms. They should be released immediately.'

The Arctic 30 and their boat were taken from waters near the port of Murmansk on September 19 after two of them tried to board the rig.

Those arrested include citizens of Australia, Brazil, Canada, Denmark, the Netherlands, Finland, France, Sweden, Poland, Turkey and Ukraine and the US.

Greenpeace has warned a spill in Arctic waters would be highly damaging to the environment and the extraction of more fossil fuels would add to climate change impacts.

Gazprom's plans to start drilling from the Prirazlomnaya platform in the first quarter of 2014 raised the risk of an oil spill in an area that contains three nature reserves protected by Russian law, campaigners have said.

A high-profile international campaign calling for their release has seen 11 Nobel Peace Prize laureates, including South African archbishop Desmond Tutu, write a letter to Mr Putin urging that the piracy charges be dropped.

The letter came after German chancellor Angela Merkel became the first head of state to raise the issue of the crew's detention with Mr Putin, urging a speedy resolution of the case in a phone call.

The families of the Britons involved have also met Foreign and Commonwealth Office officials to discuss what was being done to bring their loved ones home.
