Rock star Courtney Love has revealed how she saw Peaches Geldof and a friend at her hotel with 500 ‘hillbilly heroin’ pills – before she ‘pushed’ the young star out of the door.

The rocker, who has battled drug addiction in the past, said she was horrified when she saw the pair with a bag of tablets.

The 49-year-old was staying at the upmarket Chateau Marmont in Los Angeles when she met up with Bob Geldof’s daughter.

Miss Geldof's friend had a bag of the opiate-based OxyContin tablets, known as ‘hillbilly heroin’, a pain relieving drug sometimes abused by people seeking a heroin-style high.

But when Ms Love saw the pills she said she 'physically' pushed Peaches and her friend out of the door.

Recalling the incident, in 2010, she told Grazia that the encounter made her want her to help the young socialite - but that despite trying to mentor her 'it proved to be impossible'.

'My drug was heroin, I stopped taking it in the 90s, but I have taken the pills, the Roxycontin, Oxycontin,' she said.

'Peaches was in a room with a friend who had a bag full of these drugs, like 500 pills and I wanted it so badly, never have I ever wanted anything more - no man, no money - and I had to physically push Peaches and her friend out of the door.

'I was shaking and I kept thinking of the way her mother died and I thought I owe it to this girl to be an example.’

She
 said the encounter with ‘vivacious’ Miss Geldof, who was 21 at the time, brought her out in a 
‘cold sweat’ and that she had to battled her urges ‘when the junkie in 
me came out’ during their meeting.

The magazine columnist’s death had tragic similarities to that of her mother, Paula Yates, who died from an accidental heroin overdose in 2000 at the age of 41.

Ms Love said she believed the 25-year-old had turned her life around before her death having appeared to settle down after marrying Thomas Cohen and having two children, Astala and Phaedra.

And she added that she was grateful the daughter she had with late husband Kurt Cobain, Frances Bean, was ‘sensible’.

Miss Geldof was found dead in her home on April 7.

Mr Cohen found her slumped on her bed after he had been unable to contact her the night before.

It was revealed at the opening of the TV presenter and columnist’s inquest that recent heroin use ‘was likely to have played a role’ in her death.

Earlier this month, police confirmed that drugs paraphernalia had been found in her home.

After launching an investigation into the death, Kent Police said it was ‘unexplained with no third party’ involvement, and added that Mr Cohen was not under suspicion of any involvement.

Officers also revealed that burglars had struck twice at the couple's home since she died.

A red ride-on lawnmower, which featured in one of their family photographs taken before Miss Geldof’s death, was stolen in the first incident in mid-April.

No items were stolen in the second break-in.

CCTV had been installed in the £1million home, in Wrotham, Kent, but the cameras were damaged by the trespassers.

It later emerged Miss Geldof  had argued with her husband over her 'obsession' with heroin addict singer Elliott Smith the last time they were seen in public, four days before her death.

The pair were overheard arguing on a train into central London, over the number of songs the 25-year-old had on her iPhone by the U.S singer who committed suicide 10 years ago.

Mr Cohen, 23, left the train alone following the row. It is believed to be the last time he saw his wife alive.

Four days later he returned to their Wrotham home after growing concerned when he struggled to reach her. He discovered Peaches' lifeless body slumped across a spare bed.

It has also emerged that Miss Geldof had been secretly visiting a drug rehab clinic close to her home in Maidstone in the weeks before her death.

Peaches was buried last month in a coffin decorated with a picture of her young family at the church near Faversham where she married just two years ago.

It was also where her parents – Miss Yates and Bob Geldof – tied the knot in 1986 and where her mother’s funeral was held.

An inquest into her death has been adjourned until July 23.
