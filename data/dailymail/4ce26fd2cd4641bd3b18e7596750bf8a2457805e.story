It may have been the wedding of the year, but Kim Kardashian, who wore three different hairstyles on her fairy tale day, has failed to make Vogue's best wedding hair of all time.

The 34-year-old Vogue cover star, who wed Kayne West on May 24th with a hairdo inspired by Ali McGraw in Love Story, lost out to both modern and timeless brides alike.

From Poppy Delevingne's tousled locks and Gisele Bündchen's beach waves to Audrey Hepburn's flower crown and Priscilla Presley's bouffant, Kim's modern do' with a retro nod failed to make the cut.

It may have been the wedding of the year, but Kim Kardashian, who wore three different hairstyles on her fairy tale day, has failed to make Vogue's best wedding hair of all time

'The requirements are simple enough: something blithe, timeless, and not overworked; understated glamour with ethereal panache,' stated Vogue.

Chris McMillan, who styled Kim's hair on her wedding day, as well as for her pre-wedding brunch at the Valentino estate and the rehearsal dinner, believes her bridal blow-dry was 'very fashionable, very chic, and very modern,' he told Hollywood Life. 

So could this be a snub for Kim? Though Anna Wintour had previously defended her decision to put Kim and Kanye on the April cover of Vogue, she recently suggested that the choice was 'tasteless'.

According to Fashionista, the magazine editor said at the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York: 'I think if we just remain deeply tasteful and just put deeply tasteful people on the cover, it would be a rather boring magazine!'

She added that even from the very beginning, Vogue was never about pleasing everyone. 'The first celebrity that I put on the cover of Vogue was Madonna, and that was considered completely controversial at the time, too,' she explained.

For Kim's wedding look, Chris gave her a 'classic blow-dry with a round brush' after applying 'a little bit of Full Mousse at the crown.'

He continued: 'We did a center part... it reminded me of Ali MacGraw in Love Story.

'Then I added a small pump of Satin at the ends of Kim’s hair to make it look shiny and healthy. I really wanted her hair to look as healthy, pretty, and youthful as possible.'

Because of Kim's veil, Chris tucked her hair behind her ears to keep the look 'simple and elegant. The whole look was very modern, chic, and different,' he explained.

Stylist Vanessa Traina Snow, Carolyn Bessette-Kennedy and Dianna Ross all echoed Jemma's neat knot, while model Caroline Trentini took a more relaxed approach to the style.

Flower crowns (Audrey Hepburn and Jane Birkin) and Marcel waves (Lauren Bacall and Ingrid Bergman) also feature prominently in the list, as do romantic braids (model Bette Franke) and gently tousled waves (Poppy Delevingne, Kate Moss, Brigitte Bardot and Gisele Bündchen) - featuring plenty of inspiration for any bride-to-be.
