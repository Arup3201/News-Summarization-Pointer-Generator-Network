The Government appears to have bowed to pressure from Labour and pushed the decision on Rupert Murdoch's bid to take over BSkyB until Septmber.

News Corp already owns 39 per cent of BSkyB and is trying to acquire the rest.

The deadline for submissions on whether to approve Murdoch’s controversial £10billion bid is at noon tomorrow, but there have been widespread calls for the process to be suspended in the wake of the phone hacking scandal.

According to the The Financial Times, the Culture Secretary Jeremy Hunt, who has quasi-judicial control of the bid, will now not give his decision until September.

No change: Baroness Rawlings ruled out calling a halt to the BSkyB takeover bid, being run by Jeremy Hunt, right, despite the deepening phone hacking sandal

In the House of Lords today, shadow 
Lords leader Baroness Royall of Blaisdon tabled an urgent question 
warning that refusing to suspend the process would be seen as 
'incomprehensible both by the public and by News Corporation's 
advertisers and investors'.

Government spokeswoman Baroness Rawlings seemed to refuse to budge from the position set out by David Cameron yesterday, maintaining that the hacking scandal does not affect the unrelated issue of the takeover.

She said: 'The Culture Secretary (Jeremy Hunt) takes the view that News Corp have offered serious undertakings and discussed them in good faith in all circumstances.

'And given that the implementation of those undertakings will be overseen by the monitoring trustee and thereafter monitored and if necessary enforced by the OFT (Office of Fair Trading), he takes the view that there are sufficient safeguards to make certain compliance with the undertakings.'

In reply to Lady Rawlings' short statement, Lady Royall said: 'I think the House, and indeed the country, will know that that is the wrong answer.'

The phone hacking scandal continued to hit BSkyB's share price, which slid another 12p today, dropping 1.45 per cent to 815p.

Mr Hunt had been expected to give the green light to the deal this month, clearing the way for Mr Murdoch to seize full control of the satellite broadcaster.

But Government sources last night 
indicated that a decision would be delayed until at least the autumn 
after a consultation on the deal was deluged with complaints from the 
public.

Lady Rawlings appeared to support that today when she said there was not yet a date set for the final decision and that Mr Hunt 'would not be rushed on his decision'.

Mr Hunt has received around 100,000 submissions to consider before he reaches a final decision. 

A spokesman for the Department for Culture, Media and Sport said a more accurate figure would be available after the consultation process ends at noon tomorrow.

Mr Hunt paved the way for the deal to go through last month when he agreed beefed-up proposals that will see Sky News run as an independent company to allay fears that the deal would give Mr Murdoch's News Corporation too much control of the media.

He will make the final decision on whether to wave through the merger once and for all or refer it to the Competition Commission after the consultation period ends at noon tomorrow.

Deepening scandal: Will phone hacking accusations scupper Rupert Murdoch's BSkyB buyout as it nears the final hurdle?

News Corp's bid already faced opposition
from rivals in the media industry and some politicians but the 
phone-hacking scandal at News International has brought the deal even 
more under the spotlight and yesterday Ed Miliband urged the Government 
to refer it to the commission.

He told the House of Commons: 'The 
public will not accept the idea that, with this scandal engulfing the 
News of the World and News International, that the Government should in 
the coming days be making a decision, outside of the normal processes, 
for them to take control of one of the biggest media organisations in 
the country.'

But the Prime Minister brushed off 
his call and said the Government had followed 'absolutely to the letter'
the correct legal processes over the bid.

Ministers came under intense pressure
yesterday to formally suspend the bid pending police inquiries into 
allegations of phone hacking at the News of the World, which is owned by
Mr Murdoch’s News Corporation.

Labour
leader Ed Miliband told David Cameron in the Commons: ‘The public will 
react with disbelief if next week the decision is taken to go ahead with
this deal at a time when News International is subject to a major 
criminal investigation.’

Mr Miliband said the deal should be referred to the Competition Commission to provide ‘breathing space’.

The
Prime Minister said ministers had a duty to follow ‘the correct legal 
processes’ in considering the BskyB deal or face a potential challenge 
in the courts.

The Government consultation into the deal closes tomorrow and sources said ministers had a duty to consider all responses.

Sources
pointed out that an internet campaign has generated almost 400,000 
complaints and said they would take ‘some time’ to consider.

MPs on all sides yesterday called for a delay in the decision.

In
a statement yesterday Ofcom said it was also 'closely monitoring' the 
allegations as it it had a duty to be satisfied on an ongoing basis that
holders of broadcasting licences are 'fit and proper'.

If they decide that News Corporation is not suitable this would delay any takeover.

The
news affected share prices in both London and New York, where News 
Corporation shares opened nearly 3 per cent down yesterday.

And in London, shares in BSkyB closed down 19.5p at 825.5p last night.

Rupert
Murdoch yesterday issued a statement calling the hacking allegations 
'deplorable and unacceptable', as he backed Rebekah Brooks to continue 
as chief executive of News International - the UK arm of News Corp which
publishes the News of the World.

'I
have made clear that our company must fully and proactively co-operate 
with the police in all investigations and that is exactly what News 
International has been doing and will continue to do under Rebekah 
Brooks' leadership,' his statement said.

'I
have also appointed Joel Klein to provide important oversight and 
guidance and Joel and Viet Dinh, an independent director, are keeping 
News Corporation's board fully advised as well.'

Mr Murdoch's News Corp currently owns 39 per cent of BskyB but is keen to acquire the rest of the pay-TV group.

News
Corp bid 700p a shares for BSkyB last year, valuing the company at 
£12.3bn. However, independent shareholders of BSkyB have made public 
their view that such a price would significantly undervalue the 
broadcaster.
