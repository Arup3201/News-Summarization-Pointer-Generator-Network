Couple: Adolf Hitler with Eva Braun, who may have been descended from a Jewish family

When they committed suicide in his bunker at the end of the Second World War, Eva Braun had been Adolf Hitler’s mistress for more than 12 years and his wife for a mere 40 hours.

It seems, however, that despite their time together, she may have kept a crucial family secret from the Fuhrer.

For the man who exterminated millions of Jews in the war may have been in love with a woman with Jewish ancestry.

DNA analysis of hair found on a brush that belonged to her seems to show a link through her maternal line, it  emerged yesterday.

Hitler kept Miss Braun, who was 23 years his junior and a teenager when she first met him, largely hidden away at his Alpine residence, the Berghof.

Scientists tested hair samples which are said to have come from a hairbrush used by Braun and discovered at Hitler’s  mountain retreat.

They found a particular sequence within the DNA, which had been passed down the maternal line – the haplogroup N1b1 – which it is claimed is ‘strongly associated’ with Ashkenazi Jews, who make up around 80 per cent of the global Jewish population.

Many Ashkenazi Jews in Germany converted to Catholicism in the 19th century.

The test was made for Channel 4 programme Dead Famous DNA, to be shown on Wednesday.

Presenter Mark Evans said: ‘This is a thought-provoking outcome. I never dreamt I would find such a potentially extraordinary and profound result.’

Although programme-makers said the provenance of the hair was strong, the only way to prove beyond doubt that it was from Miss Braun would have been to take a DNA swab from one of her two surviving female descendants, but both refused, so there is still an element of mystery.

Found: The brush and a mirror, both pictured, were taken from Eva Braun's private apartment in Bavaria

Dinner: Hitler and Eva Braun. The tests were inconclusive because Braun's descendants refused a DNA test

Private life: This photograph of the Fuhrer sleeping next to Eva Braun was banned during his lifetime

The hairs came from a monogrammed brush found at the Bavarian residence in 1945 by US army intelligence officer Captain Paul Baer, who took a number of items from Braun’s private apartment.

His son Alan Baer said: ‘In our basement I remember there was a duffel bag and in the duffel bag there were several Nazi ceremonial daggers, a human skull and this case with the initials in gold, E.B.

'We opened it up and there was a mirror and a hairbrush.’

After his father’s death in the 1970s, Mr Baer sold the brush and the hair ended up with specialist dealer John Reznikoff.

Mr Evans bought eight strands of the hair from Mr Reznikoff for £1,200.
