Great Britain suffered their first defeat of the Hopman Cup after going down 2-1 to Poland.

Andy Murray and Heather Watson were successful in their first match against France on Monday, but Watson lost to Agnieszka Radwanska and although Murray's win over Jerzy Janowicz levelled the tie, the Poles won the doubles.

In their singles encounter, Watson broke Radwanska in the opening game but the world number five broke straight back and then won against the serve again in the fourth to move 3-1 up.

Watson got back into the flow of the match but could not find another break as she surrendered the first set and then lost serve in the opener to the second.

Again the 22-year-old broke back but that would be the last game she won as Radwanska eased to a 6-3 6-1 victory to put the Poles ahead.

Murray also lost his opening service game as Janowicz moved into a 2-0 lead and it looked as if both Brits were set to slip up in their singles.

But the Scot then reeled off nine games in a row to take control and eventually closed out a 6-2 6-4 victory.

Murray couldn't take that momentum into the doubles though as he and Watson went down 6-4 6-4 to Radwanska and Janowicz.
