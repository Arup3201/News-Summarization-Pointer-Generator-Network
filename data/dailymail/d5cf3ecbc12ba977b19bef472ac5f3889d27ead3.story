Councillor David Cussons who pressed the for button when he meant to vote against a 260 housing development

It was a simple but crucial action to determine if a quiet market town would be changed forever by an estate of 260 new homes.

Just a push of a button on a motion he had proposed himself would register the strong opposition of councillor David Cussons.

But he made a basic and far-reaching error, pressing the wrong button – ‘for’ instead of ‘against’.

This left the vote tied and the chairman then used his casting vote to over-ride fierce local resistance and back the controversial scheme.

Previously Mr Cussons, 75, had said the new homes on a field at Kirkbymoorside, North Yorkshire, would ‘stick out like a sore thumb’.

News of the Tory district councillor’s blunder has infuriated residents as much as the housing development.

Fellow councillor Sarah Ward said: ‘It is a scandal and the decision should not have been approved.

‘It calls the whole democratic process into question. It’s an absolute disgrace that these plans have gone through on the back of a human error. The residents are outraged.’

Town Mayor Chris Dowie said: ‘I’m furious that this application has gone through as a result of what would seem to be a mistake and that this beautiful part of Ryedale, just outside our town, is going to be built on.’

Frank Youren, 83, a retired electrical engineer who objected to the scheme, said he was ‘appalled’ at the councillor’s error on the  electronic voting system.

‘This is so clumsy,’ he said. ‘The future of this small town hangs on what he did. It’s going to be terrible. Anybody can make a mistake, but I am surprised it can’t be rectified.’

Another objector Anita Bartram said: ‘It’s disgraceful. He has been a councillor for many years. I am appalled by what’s happened and he has no excuses.’

Mr Cussons did not ask for the vote to be taken again during the meeting but apologised later. ‘I pressed the wrong button, that’s all that went wrong and I would rather it hadn’t happened,’ he said.

‘I am disappointed really, I am sorry that’s what happened.’ His blunder was raised at the planning meeting immediately after the result was announced.

Chairman John Raper commented: ‘He has pressed the wrong button then.’

The planned controversial housing estate on a green site in Kirbymoorside North Yorkshire is now going ahead

In a major blow for campaigners who 
believe the development is too big and out of place, Mr Raper added: 
‘That stands, that can’t be undone.’

Ryedale District Council received 
more than 51 letters of objection from residents and the local town 
council also wanted the housing estate to be blocked.

The plans to 
build 210 houses and 50 flats on a farmer’s field will drastically 
increase the town’s population from its current figure of under 3,000.

In
 June, the same committee rejected a similar application from the same 
company, Gladman Developments. However, the plans were revised to take 
account of objections and this time planning officials had recommended 
that councillors approve the venture.

There are three buttons for councillors during meetings marked ‘for’, ‘against’ and ‘abstain’.

A spokesman for the district council said there were no written procedures covering  mistakes in using the system.

He added that it would have been left to the chairman’s  discretion on how to respond to the error.

‘Members
 were given training two years ago on how to use the system,’ said the 
spokesman. ‘We have had no problems with the system to this date.’

After
 winning backing for its plans for the homes estimated to have a sales 
value of  £25-£50million, Gladman  confirmed that it will market the 
scheme to builders.

The firm said it was unlikely work will start before the middle of next year but declined to comment any further.
