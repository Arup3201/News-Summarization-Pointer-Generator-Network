Conman: Richard Pearson stole £3,000 from a pensioner claiming he knew of a miracle fix for intolerable condition, tinnitus

A conman preyed on a vulnerable pensioner stealing £3,000 by spinning the lie that he knew a miracle fix for an incurable medical condition.

Devious Richard Pearson discovered his 73-year-old victim suffered from tinnitus - a persistent and debilitating ringing in the ears - during a chance meeting on a bus in Sunderland.

The conniving 53-year-old convinced his victim he knew of a clinic that could cure the intolerable condition.

Days later Pearson claimed to have arranged an appointment at a centre in Birmingham, making sure his elderly victim was present when he posted a £3,000 cheque on the pensioner's behalf - 'secure' the alternative treatment.

He then persuaded his victim to pay the £3,000 back in cash, escorting the pensioner to the building society to ensure he got his hands on the money.

Pearson made the scam appear more believable by telling the tinnitus sufferer he had previously been cured by the clinic.

In addition he gave him a £3,000 cheque as 'compensation' in case things went wrong.

But when Pearson backed out of his offer to give the pensioner a lift to his appointment, concerns grew and the unsuspecting victim discovered the promise of a cure had been a cruel con, and that the clinic never actually existed. 

The £3,000 compensation cheque bounced when the pensioner tried to cash it, in a bid to get his money back.

Prosecutor Mark Guiliani told Newcastle Crown Court: 'It was totally disgraceful conduct, targeting a vulnerable man. 

'There is no cure but the clinic, he said, offered alternative treatment, the victim no doubt having been told by his doctor it was an incurable condition one learns to live with.  

'He is a confidence trickster, the offending against a 73-year-old man was particularly sophisticated.

Pearson, from Sunderland, was handed a suspended prison sentence after Recorder Euan Duff said he hoped the fraudster, who is setting up a landscaping business, would repay the money

'The clinic, despite efforts by the police to locate it, does not exist.'

The court heard the case had previously been adjourned after Pearson promised to repay the money back to his victim.

But Mr Guiliani said: 'Not a penny has been forthcoming.'

The cruel con took place just weeks after Pearson cost a hire company more than £4,000 by failing to return a petrol lawn mower, mini-digger, strimmer and concrete breaker he had leased.

The machinery was never recovered after Pearson claimed they had 'been lost'.

Pearson, of Hendon Dock, Sunderland, was sentenced to six months imprisonment, suspended for two years, and ordered to pay the victim’s £3,000 back to him within the next 12 months.  

He had admitted theft and fraud charges.

Mr Recorder Euan Duff said: 'This offence was a particularly unpleasant and a particularly mean offence, targeting this man in this way.

'It was a quite determined effort, you pursuing him, going to his home and getting the money in that way.'

The judge said the sentence could be suspended 'with a good deal of hesitation' to allow Pearson, who claims to be setting up a landscaping business, to pay the money back.  

He told Pearson: 'You are extremely fortunate to be leaving the court today.'

Lewis Kerr, defending, said 'disgraceful' was an appropriate word for the offence, which he had not pre-planned, and said Pearson is a former business owner who is hoping to start afresh.

Mr Kerr said: 'He had never met the victim, there was nothing more than a chance encounter, an opportunity the defendant seized and pursued, with some determination, I accept.'
