A teenage boy has admitted to murdering his adoptive parents in the family home and is facing life in prison.

Moses Kamin, 16, pleaded guilty at Alameda County Superior Court in Oakland, California on Monday to the murders of Susan Poff, 50, and 55-year-old Robert Kamin.

Kamin was 15 when he strangled his mother, using a choke hold learned in karate class, when the pair got into an argument over his suspension from school.

He then hid her body and lay in wait at the family home for his father and strangled him on January 27 of this year.

The teenager, who is now 16, is being tried as an adult and is expected to be handed 25 years to life in prison after he accepted a last-minute plea deal.

He pleaded guilty to the first-degree murder of his mother and the second-degree murder of his father. Kamin is due to be sentenced on January 25. 

The couple’s bodies were found hidden 
under blankets in the back of the family's car parked outside their 
house near Lake Merritt in January. Investigators believe Kamin had tried 
unsuccessfully to set the vehicle ablaze.

Police had gone to the Kamin house after their employers reported they did not show up for their jobs as civil servants.

Kamin was arrested for the murders after police discovered the couple's bodies in the car and held at a juvenile detention center.

Following Kamin's arrest, colleagues said that the couple had been 
having problems with their son, who they believed was spending too much 
time in the Occupy Oakland camp.

Co-workers
 mourned the well-known couple after news of their murders. Mrs Poff's boss called her death 'a terrible loss'.

Mrs Poff, who attended UC Berkley, and Mr Kamin, a graduate of Stanford University, met through friends. The
 couple adopted in 2002 because they were unable to have their own 
children.
