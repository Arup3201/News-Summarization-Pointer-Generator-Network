Controversial designer Tom Ford has sparked fury by launching a range of penis necklaces - just in time for Christmas.

The phallic pendants - which resemble the shape of a cross - come in gold or silver and are available with small, medium and large charms.

Intended as the perfect holiday gifts for kinky fashionistas, size apparently doesn't matter as they are all priced $790.

But the latest offering from the designer provoked outrage on Twitter from users who said the necklaces were 'unbelievably offensive' to Christians and branded Ford 'sick' for combining a phallic image with a religious symbol.

Tom Ford caused controversy after launching a range of phallic pendants, priced $790, in time for Christmas 

 Susan Swift wrote: 'Just in time for Christmas, a way to say "screw Christ," the savior of the world. This is sick. Just sick.'

Kevlyn Hall added: 'How dare you use a phallic symbol in the Christian cross! You insulting piece of trash! HOW DARE YOU!'

One user said on Twitter: 'This is unbelievably offensive to me. Is he insane?'  

And another user said the designer could 'rot in hell', adding: 'What is wrong with people these days?'

 The designer has had fashion ads banned in the past for appearing too raunchy, including an advert in 2007 for a men's fragrance that featured a bottle of perfume between a model's open thighs.

In 2003, a controversial campaign for Gucci which featured the fashion house's iconic G shaved into a model's pubic hair, was also banned and condemned for being vulgar and degrading. 

MailOnline has contacted a representative for Tom Ford for comment.
