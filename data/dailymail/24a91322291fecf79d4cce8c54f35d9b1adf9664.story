Sam Twiston-Davies says Rocky Creek is in flying form as it emerged that the Crabbie’s Grand National hopeful could have been given a big advantage by the handicapper.

Trained by Paul Nicholls, Rocky Creek — last seen when impressively winning the BetBright Chase at Kempton in February — was among 74 horses after the latest forfeit stage for the Aintree showpiece on April 11.

Lord Windermere, the 2014 Cheltenham Gold Cup winner trained by Jim Culloty, heads the weights on 11st 10lb, but Rocky Creek could have 9lb in hand.

Twiston-Davies schooled the nine-year-old at Nicholls’ Ditcheat base on Monday as preparations stepped up a gear, while Shutthefrontdoor — the 8-1 ante-post favourite — was put through his paces at Southwell under AP McCoy.

While public sentiment will be with McCoy for the big race, Phil Smith, the BHA’s Head of Handicapping, warns that dangers to Shutthefrontdoor lurk all around, not least from Rocky Creek, who is available at 12-1.

Smith said: ‘Rocky Creek was very impressive when he won at Kempton. If I was framing the weights now, I’d have him 9lb higher. I’d also have The Druids Nephew (a winner at the Cheltenham Festival) 10lb higher.’

Rocky Creek will be one of six bullets that Nicholls aims at the £1million race, which he won in 2012 with Neptune Collonges, and the horse has been trained with Aintree in mind — he finished fifth 12 months ago to Pineau De Re.

Twiston-Davies added of the gelding, who has run only three times this season: ‘Fingers crossed, the horse seems to be in good order. Hopefully he’ll get there in one piece. I schooled him and he was very good. He did it well at Kempton and let’s hope he’s ahead of the handicapper.

‘When he ran in the Hennessy (in November and was pulled up) it was really bad ground and I would just write that run off altogether. We have to go to Aintree with an open mind.’

As for Pineau De Re, his trainer Dr Richard Newland could require a new jockey as the veteran chaser bids to become the first horse since Red Rum in 1974 to win back-to-back Grand Nationals. Leighton Aspell, who did the steering a year ago, could be claimed to ride Many Clouds.

Newland said: ‘I might have a few calls to make. It is Leighton’s ride if he is available. It is pointless getting worried at this stage. I’m sure there will be a few interested jockeys if Leighton isn’t available.’
