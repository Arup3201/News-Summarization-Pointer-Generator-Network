Manchester City became only the second team to score 100 Premier League goals on Wednesday night as Manuel Pellegrini's side reached the landmark with a 4-0 win against Aston Villa.

Many had predicted that City's firepower would ensure a stroll towards this year's Premier League title and although it hasn't been quite that simple, the century of goals is a huge reason why the Manchester team have one hand of the trophy with one game to play.

Here, Sportsmail takes a look at just how City have reached 100 goals and why they look on course to break Chelsea's record of 103 (they only need to score four against West Ham, after all).

Vital: Yaya Toure has scored 20 of Manchester City's 100 Premier League goals

Emphatic: Toure scored City's 100th league goal of the season with this striker against Aston Villa

Yaya Toure - 20 goals

The driving force. The heartbeat. Whatever you want to call him, it's no understatement to say City would be nowhere near the Premier League summit without Toure's goals and his ability to drive his team forward when they need him most.

The 30-year-old is City's top scorer this season and has added free-kicks to his far-ranging list of skills, scoring five set pieces this term. 

Driving force: The Ivorian has scored some vital goals for City including this one against Manchester United

Sergio Aguero - 17 goals

City would surely be closer to the 120 goal mark for the season if the diminutive Argentine forward had steered clear of injuries.

Undoubtedly one of the best strikers in the world, Aguero has missed huge chunks of football but has still bagged 17 goals for his side and has been a huge factor to their success.

Forward thinking: Sergio Aguero has bagged 17 goals to add to City's century of goals

In and out: City and Aguero would no-doubt have more goals if it wasn't for Aguero's injury record

Edin Dzeko - 16 goals

Somehow, Dzeko isn't a fan favourite at the Etihad despite popping up with hugely important goals throughout the season.

The Bosnian striker is seen as a third choice behind Aguero and Alvaro Negredo, but he has scored four crucial goals in the past week alone to help City defeat both Everton and Aston Villa while leading the line admirably in Aguero's absence.  

Alvaro Negredo - 9 goals

'The Beast' looked as though he was going to be one of the signings of the season after hitting the ground running and finding the net on several occasions at the start of the campaign.

The Spanish striker's goals may have dried up of late but nine is his first season in English football isn't a bad return and one he'll be looking to build on next season.

Double: Edin Dzeko has scored some pivotal goals for City including two against Villa on Wednesday

Helping hand: Alvaro Negredo (left) has picked up nine goals while David Silva has added seven

David Silva - 7 goals

The Spanish maestro usually finds himself at the centre of everything good for City and Silva has certainly been one of City's standout players.

The 28-year-old can take huge credit from the fact that City have scored 100 goals scoring seven and setting up nine for his team-mates.

Samir Nasri - 6 goals

Nasri has been in inspired form during some important periods for his club and has popped up with vital goals against the likes of Manchester United and Southampton.

The Frenchman, like Silva, has also been crucial in setting up goals for his team-mates and has picked up seven assists for the season

Every little helps: Samir Nasri has chipped in with six goals, but also has seven assists to his name

Fernandinho - 5 goals

It's not really his job, but the Brazilian summer signing has chipped in with five goals from his deep-lying midfield role.

Fernandinho has been the perfect foil for Tour in the centre of the pitch this season with the pair forming what must be one of the most powerful midfield duos in the Premier League.

Jesus Navas - 4 goals

The flying winger has been in and out of the City first team for his fledgling year in England, but a return of four goals and seven assists has been a good start to his Etihad career.

Strike: Fernandinho celebrates scoring during City's 6-3 win against Arsenal earlier in the season

Debut: Jesus Navas has picked up four goals during his first season in English football

Stevan Jovetic - 3 goals

After missing the majority of the season with injury, Jovetic has slowly started to look the part in a Sky Blue shirt.

The striker will be hoping to score far more than three goals next season, however, as City's strikeforce grows ever stronger.

Vincent Kompany - 3 goals

The City captain has had another brilliant season at the heart of defence and has been one of Pellegrini's key men.

If your team is going to reach 100 Premier League goals, strikes from defenders are vital and he has scored three times to help reach the target.

Three and easy: Stevan Jovetic celebrates scoring his third goal of the season during City's win against Villa

Nearly there: Jovetic scores City's 99th Premier League goal of the season

From the back: Vincent Kompany (left) and Martin Demichelis have also helped City towards 100

Martin Demichelis - 2 goals

The Argentine had a rocky start to his career, but Demichelis has stepped up to the plate to become Kompany's most trusted lieutenant and he's grabbed two goals for his side.

Pablo Zabaleta, Aleksandar Kolarov, James Milner - 1 goal each

Own goals - 5

Solo: Pablo Zabaleta celebrates scoring his only goal of the season during City's win against West Brom

One each: Aleksandar Kolarov (left) and James Milner have a goal each for the season
