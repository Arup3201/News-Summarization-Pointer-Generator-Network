Cricket legend Andrew Flintoff was making catches of a different kind on Sunday afternoon as the former England bowler took part in a half-time penalty shootout during Manchester City's 1-0 win against Manchester United.

Flintoff, kitted out in full City goalkeeping kit, was taking part in the spot-kick challenge for Sky One's A League Of Their Own sports quiz show as he was joined by a number of famous faces including David Seaman and James Corden. 

The 36-year-old played up to the home fans by kissing the badge after stepping between the sticks to face a penalty from West Ham fan Corden.

The former England Test cricketer proved his reflexes are still intact by diving to his left top stop Corden's well-struck penalty before turning to celebrate with the Etihad faithful. 

Flintoff seemed to be enjoying his day at the Manchester derby, taking to Instagram to post a picture of himself with colleagues Josh Widdicombe and Jack Whitehall.

The Lancashire-native even joked that he was 'open to offers' from football clubs looking for a new goalkeeper as his impressive save spread across social media.
