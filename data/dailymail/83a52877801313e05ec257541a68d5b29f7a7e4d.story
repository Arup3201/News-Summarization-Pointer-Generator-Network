Aston Villa captain Ron Vlaar is not guaranteed his starting place back even when fully fit because of the form of stand-ins Ciaran Clark and Jores Okore.

Manager Paul Lambert insists the Holland defender has a ‘fight’ ahead to earn selection given Villa have not lost since the deputy centre backs stepped up.

Clark, 25, and Okore, 22, have started the last four Premier League games due to calf injuries to Vlaar and Philippe Senderos, as well as Nathan Baker’s knee problem.

Draws with Southampton and Burnley were followed by wins over Crystal Palace and Leicester City.

Vlaar, whose last game was the draw at West Ham United, is back in training and in contention for Saturday’s game against West Bromwich Albion - but he is by no means a certainty once he is 100 per cent fit.

‘You earn the right then you’re in the team,’ said Lambert. ‘Your job is to stay in it. Those two lads have been playing really well now.

‘I’m sure Ron, Philippe and Nathan will know that there’s a really big fight on for them to get in the side. You need that competition for people to play on top of their game.

‘Ciaran and Jores have been absolutely excellent for us and have struck up a good understanding. They’re in form and there’s a good little partnership developing there.

‘In the four games they’ve played together they’ve been outstanding, the two of them. Sometimes you just stumble on things and it works.

‘To be fair to Jores, he had 14 months out before he played Southampton and that’s a long, long time out of football.

‘To come in and perform the way he has - his standards have been exceptionally high. And Ciaran seems to be thriving on the responsibility, helping him through it.’

Lambert will set two personal records if Villa win at The Hawthorns. Villa have not gone six games unbeaten under his stewardship, nor won three games on the run.
