Andrew Kelly, pictured outside York Crown Court, was caught speeding at 122mph, and used a forum to try and avoid a conviction

A biker who was caught speeding at 122mph visited an internet forum to brag about how he avoided a parking fine and to ask for advice on how to avoid speeding points.

Andrew John Kelly, 37, took to the forum to find out how he could get off the speeding charge after he was clocked with a friend.

A court heard how he persistently lied to the police and provoked outrage on the forum after admitting to other users that he had been caught on the A63 near Selby, North Yorkshire, on June 20 last year.

Police were tipped off by Road Safety Support - a not-for-profit company providing specialist services to the police and local authorities - about the thread on pepipoo.com in September last year and Kelly was arrested.

Kelly, of Pudsey, West Yorkshire, was jailed for eight months after admitting two counts of  perverting the course of justice and one charge of speeding.

A judge labelled his behaviour 'calculated, deliberate and thoroughly disturbing'.

During the investigation, police uncovered that father-of-one Kelly had previously boasted about how he had forged a recovery invoice and claimed his car had broken down when he parked in a disabled parking space so he could buy a sandwich.

Posting under the name 'andyroo', Kelly, who works as an MOT tester at his father’s garage, stated that he was the rider at the time of the offence but  didn’t want the points so asked other users how to avoid being caught.

His comments provoked a backlash from other forum members on the site and his account was terminated by the administrators.

During police interviews he claimed that a man called 'Richard' was riding his bike at the time of the offence but he could not provide any further information about 'Richard' as he claimed the diary in which he kept his details had been stolen.

In a message posted on the forum on August 24 last year, Kelly said: 'I’m in a bit of a dilemma. I and a friend of mine were caught speeding on our motorcycles - both caught by a mobile speed camera van at 122mph in a 70mph limit.

'I didn’t sign for the nip because I wasn’t at work and so they left me a ticket to collect the letter at the post office and I never collected it as I knew what it was.

'Next they sent one to my work three weeks later unrecorded and I never replied.

'I’m not sure what to do next?'

In another message, Kelly outlines how he lied to avoid a parking ticket after he posted a copy of the letter he sent to Leeds City Council with an accompanying false invoice.

His comment says: 'It took me 20 minutes to write. It’s all bull but I’m proud of it.

In an angry backlash from others visiting the forum, one user writes: 'You are a complete idiot and a dishonest one at that. You fabricated a pack of lies and forged a receipt just to get out of a council parking fine.

'This forum is about getting justice by lawful means, not using crooked tactics to get away with it at any cost.'

Another wrote: 'I’d find it funny if the CPS bring up this thread in court when he’s there trying to escape his 122mph case that he’s being done for.'

In response to his critics, Kelly wrote: 'This forum is a waste of time.

'Don’t make me laugh. Next you’re all going to tell me you never told a lie? Oh yes, and you’re all honest, law-abiding citizens.'

Adrian Pollard, defending Kelly, told the court: 'These are short-sighted, blinkered acts of stupidity and thoughtlessness.

'Over a period of months, he has become caught up in his own obsessiveness.

'He has not recognised the consequences at he outset to his father’s business, his employees and to his own family.

'He is terrified at the prospect of custody. Those around him are astounded at his degree of publicity and how he’s dealt with relatively simple matters.'

After his account was terminated, Kelly opened another account under the name 'Andyrooisback' in September last year.

He posted: 'Andyroo is back. I must thank those who tipped off the law enforcement officers. I must buy you a pint.

'No one likes a grass. I lied - big deal.'

Traffic Constable Zoe Billings of North Yorkshire Police said: 'Unbelievably Kelly published his intention to lie about who was riding his motorbike on the internet.

'When forum users spoke of their disgust at his dishonesty, he then bragged to them about how he had lied in the past and got away with not paying for a parking ticket.

'Our investigation also revealed that Kelly had a history of failing to comply with statutory documentation and a complete disregard for road safety.

'He tried to portray himself as a simple mechanic who was poor at paperwork, but in reality, he is an accomplished liar.

'He continued to lie during police interviews and only when presented with overwhelming evidence through his seized clothing, did he admit to being the rider of the bike.'

TC Billings added: 'This case sends a very clear message that we will leave no stone unturned to ensure that those who put lives in danger on our roads are brought to justice.'

Stephen Smith, co-founder of the pepipoo.com motoring advice website and forums, said: 'This case shows yet again that many people don’t appear to appreciate the seriousness of lying about what they may see as "just speeding", or even something as minor as a parking fine.'
