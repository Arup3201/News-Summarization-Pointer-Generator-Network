Police and protesters in Ferguson, Missouri, clashed once again Wednesday night as tensions boiled over during a planned demonstration against the shooting of Michael Brown by police officer Darren Wilson in August. 

Between 100 and 150 protesters marched to the police station from just blocks away from Brown was shot.

They chanted, demanding justice for Brown and calling for the arrest of Ferguson Police Officer Darren Wilson.

When the group finally arrived at the police station, the march then turned ugly and into a stand off against Ferguson police, who brought out riot gear and protective shields as they erected a barricade on the opposite side of the street.

The spark for the rise in tensions came after Michael Brown's official autopsy was leaked and shows how the 18-year-old was shot in the hand at close range during a struggle with the Ferguson police officer who fatally shot him.

The St. Louis Post-Dispatch obtained the St. Louis County medical examiner's autopsy and an accompanying toxicology report that shows Brown had used marijuana.

The newspaper reported that St. Louis medical examiner Dr. Michael Graham and another pathologist not involved in the investigation reviewed the report and said it indicates a wound to Brown's hand came at close range.

Activists said the leak of the report to the newspaper simply added to tensions in the community, which has been the site of numerous protests, including last nights where there have been regular clashes between demonstrators and police, in the 10 weeks since the shooting.

Yesterdays protest was scheduled to coincide with a day of action planned to take place nationwide to draw attention to police brutality

It was on August 9th when the shooting happened. It was shortly after noon when Brown was walking down the middle of a neighborhood street with a friend and Officer Wilson, who was driving by, ordered them out of the street.

Accounts then differ but witnesses and law enforcement officials have agreed that Wilson and Brown became embroiled in an altercation through the window of the Wilson's vehicle and Wilson exited his vehicle and shot Brown several times.

Brown was shot once in the hand and was eventually killed outside the vehicle.

Graham told the Post-Dispatch that the autopsy report 'does support that there was a significant altercation at the car.'

Brown family attorney Benjamin Crump told the Associated Press that the autopsy offers no insight into why Wilson killed Brown.

The newspaper posted a copy of the autopsy and toxicology report on its website. 

Medical examiner's office administrator Suzanne McCune confirmed the posted information was accurate but said her office won't officially release the documents until the investigation is complete. 

The newspaper did not say where it obtained the documents.

Wilson remains on paid administrative leave pending the outcome of the investigation into the shooting that has sparked sometimes violent protests in Ferguson. 

On Tuesday, Gov. Jay Nixon appointed a special commission to look at how the region can move forward after the concerns raised by the shooting and its aftermath.

Wilson confronted Brown and Dorian Johnson as they walked back to Brown's home from a convenience store. After the shooting, Brown died at the scene.

Some witnesses have told authorities and news media that Brown had his hands raised when Wilson approached with his weapon and fired repeatedly. 

The leaked report comes days after the New York Times, citing federal government officials briefed on a civil rights investigation, reported that Wilson told investigators he feared for his life and battled with Brown in his vehicle over his gun.

A grand jury is considering charges against Wilson, who has not spoken publicly about the shooting. Protesters have said they expect widespread unrest if he is not charged and local and state authorities have said they are preparing for that possibility.

"There is a lack of trust. That is why people are protesting every single night," said Rashad Robinson, executive director of Color of Change, a civil rights organization. "They have a fundamental belief that the system is stacked against them. These continual leaks raise a lot of suspicion."

Ferguson, Missouri, police and protesters clashed on Wednesday night after tensions escalated during a scheduled demonstration, part of the Ferguson October movement

Michael Brown's gunshot wounds included a shot in the hand at close range, his official autopsy shows, according to an analysis reported by the St. Louis Post-Dispatch newspaper

At least two people were detained after demonstrators threw water bottles at the police barricade

Wilson told investigators that during a struggle for his pistol inside a police SUV, Brown pressed the barrel of Wilson's gun against the officer's hip

The officer tried to prevent Brown from reaching the trigger, the source told the newspaper, and when he thought he had control, he fired

Once the group arrived at the Police Department the march turned into a standoff against Ferguson police, who had erected a barricade on the opposite side of the street

Ed Magee, a spokesman for the St. Louis County prosecutor's office, said a decision is expected sometime in mid-November.

Brown's death has sparked protests across Ferguson, a primarily black community with a mostly white police force and city government, and has drawn global attention to race relations in the United States.

The St. Louis County medical examiner's autopsy indicates that Brown's hand was close to Wilson's weapon, according to forensic experts interviewed by the St. Louis Post-Dispatch.

The autopsy said a microscopic examination of Brown's hand tissue showed particles "consistent with products that are discharged from the barrel of a firearm." The medical examiner also found that Brown tested positive for marijuana.

A representative for the county medical examiner verified the authenticity of the autopsy report the newspaper posted and said the office did not provide the report to the Post-Dispatch.

Wilson said he fired two shots, and Brown was hit in the hand and ran. Wilson told investigators he fired again when Brown turned back and charged at him

Wilson said he had no choice but to draw his pistol when faced with the 'incredibly strong' teen. Brown was 6-foot-4 and nearly 300lb at the time of his death.

Wilson said he couldn't use his pepper spray in the close quarters because it would have hit him too. His baton was out of reach at the back of his belt.

In the statement Wilson told how Brown grabbed at the pistol and continued to hit him in the face. 

The officer, who said he almost passed out in the attack, then told how he felt Brown, whose strength he found remarkable, twisting the barrel towards his own body. 

At one point, the muzzle of the gun was pointed at Wilson's own hip. 

Wilson went on to describe how he jerked back inside the car, loosening Brown's grip on the gun enough for him to squeeze the trigger.

But, he said, the first time nothing happened - because Brown had his finger in the gun's hammer, which stopped it from firing.  

Separate accounts of the events which have been made public have also claimed there was a scuffle of some sort inside the police car - citing blood and skin samples picked up in investigations.

When Wilson pulled the trigger again, the pistol went off, hitting Brown's hand and sending glass cascading around the car.

Evidence presented by the Post-Dispatch from the autopsy report also seems to support a close-range impact. The document told how the entry wound in Brown's hand had no 'stippling' - a feature of mid-range impacts - suggesting a point-blank release. 

In his account, Wilson then described firing a second shot - which missed. Brown then ran away. 

Response: Police have donned riot gear to meet the protesters in ugly confrontations

Wilson said he was left unable to radio for backup because his transponder had been knocked away from the right setting in the chaos.

So, on his own, Wilson said he got out of the car and gave chase. It was at that point when Brown turned.

Wilson said Brown then 'charged' at him and wouldn't stop when he yelled. He started firing, and hit four times. One shot, Wilson said, hit Brown's forehead and brought him down.

He also denied - as many witnesses have claimed - that Brown had his hands up in a gesture of surrender.

Wilson's extensive account is at odds with several others which have emerged in the wake of the killing, which has sparked widespread and ongoing protests in the Missouri town.

Others have said Brown was fleeing, or had unambiguously surrendered. It has also been suggested that Wilson himself was more aggressive toward Brown than suggested in the latest account.
