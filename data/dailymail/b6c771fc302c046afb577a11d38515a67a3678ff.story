Whistleblower Sandra Haynes-Kirkbright was suspended by Royal Wolverhampton Hospitals NHS Trust after raising concerns about 'fixed' figures

An NHS whistleblower has been threatened with the sack after going public with concerns that a hospital was fiddling its appalling death rates.

Sandra Haynes Kirkbright claimed she was headhunted by hospital bosses and asked to 'fix' the figures to cover up the true extent of the hospital's failings.

Mrs Haynes Kirkbright was suspended by the Royal Wolverhampton Hospitals NHS Trust after repeatedly raising her concerns – and in March last year spoke to the Daily Mail about fears that she had been hired to make the death rates look better.

Last week she received a letter via email ordering her to attend a disciplinary hearing. The letter also revealed she could be fired for speaking out.

The threat is totally at odds with repeated assurances from the Government and the chief executive of the NHS that whistleblowers acting in the public interest will be protected.

In the letter, hospital bosses claimed the  50-year-old 'behaved recklessly or negligently' by going public 'without the Trust's authorisation to do so'.

The hospital also accused the whistleblower of breaching her employment contract by ignoring confidentiality agreements and rules regarding speaking to the Press.

The letter adds: 'The hearing will be held in order to consider the facts of this case, and you should be aware that this may result in formal disciplinary action, not excluding dismissal.'

The Mail last year revealed the case of whistleblower Gary Walker – a former hospitals chief in Lincolnshire who broke a £500,000 gagging clause to raise urgent concerns about patient safety and high death rates.

The scandal prompted Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt to insist he would ban gagging clauses, declaring: 'The era of gagging NHS staff from raising their real worries about patient care must come to an end.'

Last night Stephen Dorrell, the Tory chairman of the Health Select Committee, warned any hospital which tried to sack a whistleblower could face action from NHS executives.

'If it can be shown information has been disclosed in the public interest then any attempt to take disciplinary action against that person should prompt action against the hospital by NHS management,' he told the Mail.

Threat: Sandra Haynes Kirkbright and an edited version of the letter she received

Former Health Secretary Mr Dorrell said legal safeguards and assurances by NHS chief executive Sir David Nicholson protected whistleblowers.

Mrs Haynes Kirkbright was a health coder – administrators who record details of the care received by patients. They do not need medical qualifications and have been accused of having too much influence over how hospitals are found to be performing.

Mrs Haynes Kirkbright, who is originally from Texas, was hired by Royal Wolverhampton in October 2011 after it scored one of the highest mortality rates in the country, with concerns raised over high numbers of deaths at weekends.

She had previously worked at Stafford Hospital, where she had overseen an improvement in coding following the hospital scandal there.

Mrs Haynes Kirkbright said conditions at Wolverhampton were as bad or worse as those at Stafford, where as many as 1,200 patients died needlessly.

But rather than improving patient care, she believed the hospital wanted to improve its shocking death rates.

Bosses offered to almost double her salary to £54,000 a year in the belief that she had distorted death figures at Stafford and could do the same for them.

She refused to do this but realised others at the trust were 'breaking every rule in the book'. She claimed coders were using tenuous excuses to record too many deaths at the hospital under 'palliative care' category.

This meant their deaths – officially classed as unavoidable – would not alter the hospital's highly scrutinised mortality rate.Palliative care focuses on relieving the suffering of patients.

Figures show between 2009 and 2011 the death rate at Wolverhampton fell by 13 per cent, from very poor levels to the national average. At the same time, the number of deaths recorded as 'palliative care' rose from 2.19 per cent to 20.3 per cent, about double the national average.

When she blew the whistle internally, she was told not to put the allegations in writing because 'the Press can get hold of it through Freedom of Information'.

Nine months after starting work for Wolverhampton, she was suspended for alleged bullying and harassment.

She believes this was simply a way of silencing her. Mrs Haynes Kirkbright, who sought no payment for her story and is suspended on full pay, said she faced ruin if she was sacked.

'I've been sick to my stomach for three days,' she said. 'I feel like David fighting Goliath. I've just been telling the truth.'

A Health Department spokesman said: 'We have been absolutely clear that staff who have the courage and integrity to speak out … must be protected and listened to.'

The Royal Wolverhampton NHS Trust refused to comment. In the past it insisted it was 'categorically false' to suggest palliative care patients had been coded incorrectly to cut death rates.
