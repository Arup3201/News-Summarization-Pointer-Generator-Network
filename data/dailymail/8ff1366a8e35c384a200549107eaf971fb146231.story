Stuart Hall's bid to regain his world title ended in failure after a thrilling toe-to-toe clash with Randy Caballero in Monte Carlo.

The Darlington bantamweight displayed his trademark grit and determination in the principality but was eventually undone by the American's class.

And at just 24, the Salle des etoiles crowd may have witnessed the unearthing of a new star in Caballero as he won on all three scorecards.

Hall, 10 years his opponent's senior, won the IBF title four days before last Christmas with a battling performance against Vusi Malinga in Leeds.

His first defence, against Martin Ward, was a non-event after Ward was cut in the second round and the fight ruled a technical draw.

Hall, who spent his youth in Ibiza before turning his life around, was aggrieved when Butler was awarded a split-decision victory in Newcastle in June.

But the new champion immediately vacated to return to super-featherweight, leaving the title vacant.

Caballero, backed by the powerful Golden Boy promotional outfit and with an impressive amateur pedigree, had won his first 21 fights as a professional with 12 of his last 13 opponents bringing winning records to the table.

And the first round set the tone for the rest of the fight as neither man let up during a fast and furious opening three minutes.

But it was the Californian who stamped his authority in the second session, flooring Hall with a straight left. He recovered well, however, and the pair spent the remainder of the round head to head like rival stags.

After another three minutes that could have been fought out in a cupboard under the stairs, Caballero took a step back in the fourth stanza, found his range and punctured Hall's defence.

The Brit then let his frustrations get the better of him in the fifth, slamming his right hand into Caballero's groin, leaving him writhing around on the canvas in pain.

But Hall had his best spell of the fight as it reached the halfway point, a spell of pressure late in the session enough to halt his slide.

Neither man was showing signs of tiring and although the smaller of the two, Caballero was more than matching Hall in the strength department. And the longer the fight went on, the more his quality began to tell.

Boxing at range, he let his hands go before slipping off, leaving Hall grasping at thin air. Even when he was dragged into a dog fight, Caballero more than held his own.

Hall showed a flicker of a recovery in the 10th session but he quickly returned to the back foot and must surely have realised by now that he needed a knockout to regain his title.

Not that Caballero's winning position meant he took his foot off the pedal in the last round, however, as both men served up a finale worthy of the fight's opulent setting.

The judges are all in agreement after the final bell with scores of 116-11 twice and 118-110.
