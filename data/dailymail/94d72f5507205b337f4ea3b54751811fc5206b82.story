On paper it looks like the holy trinity of an attacking midfield, but Louis van Gaal's decision to play Adnan Januzaj and Angel di Maria either side of Juan Mata on Monday night may not be one he makes again.

Despite 90 minutes of nail-biting action, the first 30 minutes were most telling, and set the tone for the remainder of the game while summing up Manchester United's season so far.

West Bromwich Albion dominated United for the opening period, leading the game at the half-hour mark and leading every physical battle to boot.

Angel di Maria started on the left wing for Manchester United, providing the assist for Marouane Fellaini

Di Maria caused problems on the left, and often moved infield to penetrate West Brom's defence

Part of the problem was the load on midfielder Daley Blind as United attempted to spring forward using the three-pronged attacking midfield of Januzaj, Mata and Di Maria.

Januzaj, starting his first game under Van Gaal and not known for his defensive capabilities, was cemented to the right wing for the first-half, moving slightly inward in the second-half as United improved ever so slightly.

Mata, playing in the absence of the suspended Wayne Rooney, saw very little of the ball throughout, and was bypassed by United's deeper midfielders and defence.

Juan Mata started in the middle of the three-pronged attacking midfield at the Hawthorns

Mata spent much of the first-half helping Adnan Januzaj on the right of midfield, and struggled to impact

On the opposite wing Di Maria was not an individual problem. In fact the Argentine was superb again, providing the assist for Marouane Fellaini's equaliser and delivering several dangerous balls having found himself in space.

He did exactly what Januzaj didn't when 'stuck out' on the wing - making use of the situation to full effect - with the Belgian picking up a 5.5/10 rating bySportsmail. Di Maria at least attempted to move in and penetrate the penalty area more than once, as shown in his heat map.

Mata, meanwhile, is an ongoing dilemma - a £37.5million midfielder without a defined place in Van Gaal's system to justify the price tag - and it showed again at the Hawthorns.

Januzaj, on his first start for United under Van Gaal, hardly had an effect on the game on the right wing

The Belgian hugged the right wing for United, and his delivery into the box was often poor

The only man directly between Mata and goal, striker Robin van Persie, was given no support by the Spaniard and nothing to feed off. The two played too far apart, forcing (or enabling, Van Gaal would argue) United to use the flanks even more. 

Too wide and not clinical enough, United were stretched. Space behind the striker that Rooney would often fill was vacant, meaning United struggled to win the ball high up the pitch. 

Albion's only roadblock to goal when winning the ball in midfield was an out-of-position Ander Herrera and an exposed Blind.

The Januzaj-Mata-Di Maria trio made just one tackle between them, compared to five by West Brom's attacking midfield three of Chris Brunt, Stephane Sessegnon and Graham Dorrans.

It was no surprise both goals came on the break with the  trio chasing shadows, and the second goal in particular cut through the heart of United, as can be seen below.

West Brom's second goal, scored by Saido Berahino (18) came from United being cut right down the middle

Fellaini was brought on for the second half and had a big impact on the match, scoring the equaliser

Van Persie was often playing off the last West Brom man, but Mata struggled to connect with him

Van Gaal got his tactics wrong at 8pm, but the game quickly changed complexion after the first-half.

As is not often the case, there weren't too many question marks over Fellaini's introduction at the expense of Herrera at half-time, giving Blind more physical support. It worked in an attacking sense, too.

United finally had some control going forward, but none when tracking back. Two goals each was a rather predictable scoreline.
