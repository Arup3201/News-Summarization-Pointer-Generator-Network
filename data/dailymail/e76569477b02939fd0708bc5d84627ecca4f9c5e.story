Her close 
friend, fellow Sudanese model Ajak Deng – who is no relation – sent out 
an alert on Monday pleading for information about Ataui.

‘I
 feel so guilty,' she told MailOnline in an interview. 'I had been away and hadn’t spoken to her for 2½ months.
 Now I find she is missing. Her boyfriend says the last time he saw her 
she just wanted to get away, but she left her phone and everything in 
their home.’

Ajak
 said Ataui – whose full name is Ataui Deng Hopkins - has gone missing 
previously. ‘She sometimes likes to get away but only for a day or so, 
nothing like this. She would turn her phone off if she didn’t want to 
talk, but she would always have it with her.

‘I am worried sick about her.’ Ajak added.

Sandra

lounge on the night she went missing.

‘As far as we are all aware she was not there. We have not had the police here asking questions,’ said Garcia.

Ataui has been on the books of Trump Model Management since she was 16, company president Corinne Nicolas told MailOnline.

Happy together: Ataui and Monohon had lived together for two or three years. 'He was always very sweet to her,' according to a friend

‘It is a very nerve-wracking and scary situation,’ Nicolas said. ‘Hopefully someone has some information that can help find her.

'We found out at the end of last week that her boyfriend said he hadn’t seen her for a week.’

‘He
 put in a police report and we have been in touch with the detective in 
charge of the case. We are putting the word out with everyone in the 
industry and we are hopeful that someone will come forward.’
