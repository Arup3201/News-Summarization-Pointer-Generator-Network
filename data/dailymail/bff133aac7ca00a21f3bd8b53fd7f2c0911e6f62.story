When it comes to getting answers out of politicians, his abrasive manner certainly achieves results. 

But you might expect Jeremy Paxman to tone it down somewhat when the ones taking the questions are undergraduates on University Challenge. 

The presenter has been labelled ‘rude’, ‘nasty’ and a ‘bully’ by viewers who took exception to his treatment of a nervous contestant on the BBC2 quiz show – with one even commenting: ‘Why not just spit in his face, Paxman?’

Hopeful: Tom Tyszczuk Smith was looking forward to appearing on University Challenge (left) but seemed shaken after Jeremy Paxman's remarks when he answered a question wrong

Third-year medical student Tom Tyszczuk Smith, representing University College London, found himself receiving the brunt of Paxman’s ire during a quarter-final match against a team from the University of Bangor on Monday.

During one quick-fire round, the 20-year-old from Cambridge was met with a barrage of scorn by the broadcaster, 62, who also hosts current affairs show Newsnight.

In a question open to whoever pressed their buzzer first, he asked: “The liberties of England and the Protestant religion I will maintain.” Which royal figure made that claim when he landed at Brixham, in Devon, in 1688?”

A rival contestant buzzed before Paxman had finished speaking and wrongly answered: ‘Elizabeth I’.

'Bully': Jeremy Paxman raised an eyebrow and declared 'It's only about 600 years out' when a UCL student got a history question wrong

But the presenter reserved his derision for Mr Tyszczuk Smith, who came in quickly afterwards and suggested William I instead.

Looking incredulous, Paxman exclaimed: ‘No! William I? No I’m sorry that’s the wrong answer and you know it’s very wrong.’

Raising his eyebrows, he added: ‘It’s only out by about 600 years or so. Anyway no, it’s William of Orange of course, William III.’

Mr Tyszczuk Smith seemed shaken by the presenter’s reaction, putting his hand nervously to his face and shaking his head.

He said: ‘Sorry, sorry, no I’m sorry,’ and kept his head lowered for much of the remainder of the game.

Writing on Twitter, one viewer said: ‘Tyszczuk Smith looks like he’s on the verge of crying. Paxman you meany!’

The episode prompted a storm of other online comments, and 44 complaints to the BBC.

But at the family home in Cambridge yesterday, the student’s mother Renata Tyszczuk, 45, defended Paxman and said viewers had overreacted.

She said: ‘I think Paxman is always a little tough with the contestants. But I think it is all in good spirit.  'It is a challenge after all.

‘I don’t think he’s a bully. Tom wanted to do well and perhaps that showed more when he got things wrong rather than right.

'I met Mr Paxman and found him very pleasant. Tom’s very clever and we are very proud.

Embarrassed: Tom kept his head down for most of the game after he experienced Jeremy Paxman's abrasive manner

'He is a shy boy so I think at times he was a little uncomfortable, but that is just his way. He was very excited to take part and we think he did very well.’

Despite Mr Tyszczuk Smith’s mistake, the UCL team eventually beat Bangor by 190 points to 125 in the episode, watched by 2.89million.

A BBC spokesman said:  ‘University Challenge is a tense and fast-paced competition, and Jeremy Paxman’s acerbic remarks have long been part of the appeal.

'Viewers and contestants alike know what to expect from the host.’
