Criticism: Thandie Newton claimed darker shades of make-up disappear more quickly

Thandie Newton has accused Boots of creating a racial divide through the ‘ghettoisation’ of make-up.

The British film star, 41, said the high street chain initially stocks dark shades of foundation when a make-up range is launched, but then takes them off shelves much earlier than pale shades – forcing women with darker skin to shop in specialist stores.

Speaking at a Selfridges event on Tuesday, Miss Newton, who is also the face of Olay, said: ‘If the make-up was in there longer, the girls would go and get it and then the stores would get more, and they’d realise that everybody wants it, and then they would stock it.

‘There’s this ghettoisation of make-up right now. The right shade is there for everybody but you can only get it at specialised shops.

'So you don’t go to Boots. So as a result we are all being physically separated when we go and buy make-up.'

She added: ‘We’re starting to think they don’t 
want us there. And it’s not that, it’s just that six-month time lapse 
where the shops are waiting to be able to say it’s not selling so let’s 
stop stocking it. We’ve got to encourage them.’

She
 added: ‘I’ll go into Boots at Heathrow Airport if I’ve forgotten my 
make-up bag or something and there isn’t even a picture of a black 
woman. I hate that.’

Earlier this year Miss Newton revealed she suffered racist abuse growing up in Cornwall, but this is the first time the Crash star has openly attacked the beauty industry for creating a racial divide.

Miss Newton is an award-winning actress who starred in Misson: Impossible II with Tom Cruise and alongside Will Smith in The Pursuit of Happyness.

The star, who has daughters Ripley, 
14, Nico, 10, and three-month-old son Booker Jombe with her husband 
director Ol Parker, described being treated like an outsider growing up 
in Penzance.

Miss Newton also recalled going to castings where she and James Bond actress Halle Berry were the only two auditioning for a role, because of the lack of black stars in Hollywood.

Responding to the claims, make-up artist Kay Montano said: ‘Every single make-up company has every single shade. It’s all made. But it all comes down to territories and men in suits deciding what sells.’

A Boots spokesman said: ‘It is 
disappointing when we hear our customers feel we can’t meet their beauty
 needs, as many of the beauty brands available in store and on boots.com
 offer a range of products for black skin.’
