Victor Dubuisson has been dubbed European golf’s Man of Mystery, and on Tuesday it appeared that it might be in an Austin Powers kind of way.

Asked to describe himself, the home Ryder Cup team’s youngest rookie said he was quiet and humble on the course, but away from it ‘I’m very funny and a cool guy’. 

In fairness, the 24-year-old from the Cote d’Azur was not in his favoured environment, sitting behind a microphone answering questions, and within golf he is renowned for being reluctant to provide much insight into his personality.

Paul McGinley admitted trying to bring him into the team dynamic was a ‘challenge’, while slightly strangely alluding to his ‘Hollywood’ quality in terms of looks and his golfing abilities.

‘It’s very difficult to know quite what to make of Victor,’ said Lee Westwood, while Thomas Bjorn asked, ‘Does anyone really know Victor?’

Graeme McDowell was a little more expansive: ‘I’ve heard him described as an enigma, a tough guy to get your head round what he’s thinking. His sort of relaxed mood and personality could be confused with intimidation and nervousness.’

They all added, however, that they liked what they knew of him and queued up to purr over the skills, notably around the greens, which have propelled him from obscurity to the world’s top 25 within the last 12 months. He came to prominence by winning the Turkish Open last November and wasted little time in showing that was no fluke. 

At February’s World Matchplay in Arizona he reached the final, with his miraculous recoveries from off the green drawing comparison with Seve Ballesteros. And there have been top-10 finishes in the past two majors.

Victor Dubuisson  will be only the third French player in Ryder Cup history.

Thomas Levet won one and lost two matches as Europe triumphed at Oakland Hills in 2004 while Jean van de Velde lost his only match in the singles as Europe collapsed at Brookline in 1999.

This has made him an unusually big name for golf in France, where his reluctance to give much away has led to a prickly relationship with his home media, with whom he rowed after finishing seventh at Hoylake.

Dubuisson has kept details of his early life sketchy but he was born in Cannes and learned to play at Mougins, leaving school before even entering his teenage years. His golfing mentor was his grandfather, who had a major part in his upbringing after the divorce of his parents.

As he said of himself on Monday, he quickly decided that team sports would not be his thing: ‘I tried to play football but I didn’t really like it. I prefer sports like tennis or golf. You’re on your own and make your own decisions. I don’t think I could play in a collective sport.’

This self-contained nature inevitably raises the question of how he will fit in with the intense group environment of a Ryder Cup week and the japes in the team room that more extrovert members will get up to.

Dubuisson admitted he carefully guards his preparation to deliver his best where it most counts: ‘It’s very important to manage the pressure on the course but it’s even more important to manage it outside the course. When you arrive on the course sometimes you feel like, OK, finally I can just play golf.’

He did stress, though, that he was impressed by McGinley. ‘Paul is really nice with us,’ he said. ‘I know he always tries to make things easy for us.’

McGinley’s attitude is very much vive la difference. ‘There’s something special about Victor,’ he said. ‘And I like the fact he’s different.’
