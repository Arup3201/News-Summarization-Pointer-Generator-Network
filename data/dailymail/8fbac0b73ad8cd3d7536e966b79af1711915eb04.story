Starbucks will move its tax base from the Netherlands to London in an attempt to banish its ‘immoral’ image.

The coffee chain is changing controversial methods it uses to push money into overseas tax havens. The surprise announcement puts pressure on Google and Amazon, which have been criticised for similar tax avoidance.

Starbucks faced a boycott in 2012 after it emerged the company had paid corporation tax only once since arriving in the UK in 1998.

Starbucks has said it will pay more tax in the UK as it announced its European HQ will move to London. The coffee shop chain was hit by a customer boycott two years ago in protest over its tax payments

Despite sales of £3billion, the group
 posted losses because of hefty ‘royalty payments’ to its Netherlands 
office for using the brand. The set-up was branded ‘immoral’ by MPs and 
the company offered to pay HMRC £20million.

 Starbucks
 said yesterday the rights for its brand would shift to London by the 
end of the year, increasing its profits in Britain and boosting its 
payments to the Treasury.

But critics said the move was just a ploy to lower Starbucks’ total tax burden.

Accountant
 Richard Murphy said: ‘They are not paying any more tax, just paying 
more tax here. I don’t think they would have made the move if there 
wasn’t an overall tax advantage as well.’

Starbucks
 has said it will pay more tax in the UK as it moves its European 
headquarters here from the Netherlands following a row over avoidance.

It will relocate its regional head office from Amsterdam to London by the end of the year.

A
 'modest' number of senior executives will move to London so the firm 
will be 'better able to oversee the UK market', Starbucks said in a 
statement.

The regional offices of its Middle East and Africa businesses will also be moved to the UK capital.

The
 company said: 'Today, our largest and fastest-growing European market 
is the UK. As the coffee industry has grown, the UK and London 
specifically has become one of the most competitive coffee markets in 
the world.

'In the UK alone, we plan to open over 100 retail stores across the country this year, creating 1,000 new, permanent jobs.

'We expect continued growth in other European markets as well. This move will mean we pay more tax in the UK.'

Kris Engskov, Starbucks' president of Europe, the Middle East and Asia, said: 'Closer proximity to our biggest market will be critical to our success as we grow our business across Europe and the globe.'

Colin Stanbridge, chief executive of the London Chamber of Commerce and Industry, said: 'This very positive move by Starbucks greatly reinforces London as a key global centre for business and a highly desirable location for firms to base their operations.

'Creating the right environment for businesses to flourish is essential to London competing at an international level and we are delighted that Starbucks has given the capital a ringing endorsement.'
