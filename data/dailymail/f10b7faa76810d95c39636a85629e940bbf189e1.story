University of Virginia police are investigating a fresh report that a student was sexually assaulted at an on-campus residence hall last week.

A letter to students from Police Chief Michael Gibson says the alleged victim reported the case to the Dean on January 30.

No further details were immediately available. A spokeswoman for campus police couldn't immediately be reached.

It comes after Rolling Stone magazine published a story describing a culture of sexual violence at the school, focusing on the gang-rape of a student named 'Jackie'.

Another sexual assault? University of Virginia police are investigating a fresh report of abuse at the campus

That article  was later discredited by the magazine's editors, but campus and fraternity leaders have been under pressure to propose reforms.

Last month, police announced that they had been unable to confirm that an alleged gang rape occurred at Phi Psi's house, as described in the controversial Rolling Stone article.

The story detailed the graphic claims of an unnamed UVA junior who said she was gang-raped by seven men in an apparent initiation ritual at the fraternity in 2012. 

But in an email to the Associated Press, Charlottesville Police Captain Gary Pleasants said: 'The statement reads that we did not find any substantive basis to confirm the allegations occurred at Phi Kappa Psi, not that we said the assault did not occur. We are still investigating.' 

University officials are also embroiled in further controversy over the alleged murder of UVa freshman Hannah Graham, whose body was found hours after she had been at an alcohol-fueled party.

Her alleged murderer is a 32-year-old university employee.

State lawmakers are weighing legislation to mandate reporting of alleged campus sexual assaults. 

Following last month's verdict, the school declared it had reinstated the group and its activities after consulting with the police force about the findings of their investigation.

Controversy: Police did not find evidence to support the gang-rape case at Phi Psi fraternity as described by Rolling Stone magazine, which the editors have also retracted, but are still investigating the case

Further controversy: University officials are also dealing with the case of 18-year-old Hannah Graham, a student whose body was found after an alcohol-fueled party last year. Her alleged killer worked at the school 

While the school temporarily suspended fraternities' and sororities' social activities, administrators vowed to take an extensive look at improving safety on campus. 

A group of fraternities have now signed an agreement for new rules at parties, designed to make it easier for students to know how much they're drinking and to make it harder to drug the drinks.

The new party rules would ban kegs, require security personnel and ensure at least three brothers are sober. They require food and water at parties and pre-printed guest lists and forbid serving punch premixed with liquor.  

After the Rolling Stone article was published in November, the magazine issued a statement noting discrepancies in the story and apologizing to those involved in the fraternity.

Despite its apology, campus and fraternity leaders were put under pressure to adopt reforms as protesters gathered outside Phi Psi's house, with many calling for the end of all Greek Life.

The building was gratified with statements like 'UVA Center for Rape Studies' and 'Suspend Us!'. Fearing for their safety, most fraternity members fled the house, booking hotel rooms.

Meanwhile, police launched an investigation into the alleged assault at the request of the university.

'We knew that the Rolling Stone story was not true,' said 22-year-old fraternity member David Fontenot, a senior from McLean, Virginia, recalling the aftermath of the article's publication.

Justifying the reinstatement of PhiPsi, Cpt Pleasants said: 'We just didn't find any reasons to keep sanctions on that particular fraternity right now.'
