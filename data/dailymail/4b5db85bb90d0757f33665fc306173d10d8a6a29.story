George Zimmerman and his wife Shellly have been seen together in the Florida courtroom where jury selection is taking place at the start of his murder trial.

Mrs Zimmerman has been in court every day of the trial so far but until now had not been seen together with her husband.

Earlier in the week, Shelly Zimmerman arrived at the court with the family's security guard to watch the proceedings, but on Friday the couple were seen arriving together in the courtroom and even chatted with one another during a break in proceedings.

Prior to this weeks jury selection, Shelly Zimmerman was last seen in February when she had to appear in court on perjury charges.

According
to prosecutors, she lied at her husband's April 20, 2012, bond hearing 
when she testified that the couple had no money when in fact more than 
$130,000 in donations had come flooding in for her husband's defense.

More than two dozen potential jurors interviewed individually by prosecutors and defense attorneys during the past week were told to return to a Florida courthouse next week for further questioning.

The sides must agree on six jurors and four alternates. Zimmerman, a 29-year-old former neighborhood watch volunteer, is pleading not guilty to second-degree murder, claiming he shot Trayvon Martin in self-defense.

Before lunch, Judge Debra Nelson told
23 candidates to return Tuesday and she did the same to an additional 
six potential jurors before ending the day Friday.

She asked them not to discuss the case or selection process with anyone.

Court spokesman Michelle Kennedy, 
however, said a tally she had received from the judge put the number of 
potential jurors called back at 28.

Of the 29 candidates, 19 are white; six are black; two are Hispanic; one describes himself as mixed race; and one is Asian-American. The racial and ethnic makeup of potential jurors is relevant because prosecutors claim Zimmerman profiled 17-year-old Martin when he followed him through his gated community shortly before the unarmed teen was fatally shot.

The case prompted public outrage, as some critics believed authorities initially didn't investigate the case thoroughly because Martin was a black teen from the Miami area.

The potential jurors asked to return were overwhelmingly female and middle-aged.

After Friday's court session ended, defense attorney Mark O'Mara said he was confident he could pick a jury in Seminole County.

'Personally, I'm very happy about that,' O'Mara said. 'We're making good progress that jurors, for the most part are being honest and straight-forward.'

Defense investigators were able to 
uncover the Facebook posting by the dismissed juror. O'Mara said he was 
worried about possible 'stealth jurors,' who want to sit on the jury 
with ulterior motives.

'It could have easily gotten by us,' O'Mara said.

Race-related questions came up regularly during jury candidate interviews on Friday.

During
questioning of a potential juror Friday, O'Mara specifically asked a 
man in his 20s who identified as mixed race what his racial background 
was. The man said German, Filipino, Chinese and Spanish.

Later
in the day, a middle-aged black man who works in a school described his
family and friends' reaction to Martin's death as 'typical,' given a 
history of violence against African-American men in the U.S.

Prosecutors
and defense attorneys want to build a pool of 40 potential jurors who 
have been screened for any influence of pretrial publicity before they 
move to a second round of questioning. Attorneys had interviewed 41 
potential jurors over five days by mid-afternoon on Friday.

At least 85 potential jurors already have been dismissed.

A 44-day delay in Zimmerman's arrest led to protests around the nation.

Some
questioned whether the Sanford Police Department was investigating the 
case seriously since Martin was a black teen from the Miami area. 
Zimmerman identifies himself as Hispanic.

Attorneys
need to find six jurors and four alternates. In Florida, 12 jurors are 
required only for criminal trials involving capital cases, when the 
death penalty is being considered.

The
judge said Thursday that jurors picked to serve will be sequestered 
during the two weeks to a month that the trial will last.

They
will have limited contact with their families, they will spend the 
night at a hotel and their actions will be monitored by court security 
outside the courtroom during the duration of the trial.

The death of the teenager, who was unarmed, sparked protests across the U.S.

There is no dispute that Zimmerman shot an unarmed Martin, 17, during a fight on a rainy night in February 2012.

Prosecutors
will try to show the neighborhood watch volunteer racially profiled the
black teenager, while Zimmerman's attorney must convince jurors 
Zimmerman pulled his 9mm handgun and fired a bullet into the high school
student's chest because he feared for his life.

Zimmerman, who identifies himself as Hispanic, says he shot Martin in self-defense. If convicted, he could get a life sentence.

Under Florida's 'stand your ground' law, Zimmerman, 29, could shoot Martin in self-defense if it was necessary to prevent death or great bodily harm.

Zimmerman, 29, is pleading not guilty, claiming he shot the unarmed teenager in February 2012 in self-defense when the boy fought with him and went to grab his gun, he said.

A delay in Zimmerman's arrest led to protests nationwide. Martin was black. Zimmerman's father is white, and his mother is Hispanic.

Jury selection is expected to be completed sometime next week.

The trial is expected to last more than a month.
