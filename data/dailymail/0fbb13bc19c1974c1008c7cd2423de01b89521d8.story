One of the world's leading Internet movie and TV services is set to launch down under in March 2015.

Netflix announced on Tuesday its service will be available to users in Australia and New Zealand who subscribe to the network, which will allow them to instantly watch a selection of popular movies and TV shows in high-definition.

It has not yet been confirmed whether or not the online service will be bringing over its signature shows such House of Cards and Orange Is The New Black.

One of the world's leading Internet movie and TV subscription service is set to launch in Australia and New Zealand in March 2015

The announcement of the launch ends months of speculation about the local plans for the company.

The online service, which first launched in 2007, boasts some 53 million subscribers in dozens of countries

The platform will be available on smart TVs, tablets, smartphones, set-top boxes and consoles, with high-definition and 4K available.

A Netflix spokesman told Daily Mail Australia it has been unconfirmed whether shows such as House of Cards and Orange Is The New Black will be available as they are still in 'internal discussions'.

Pricing has not been disclosed but the Daily Telegraph reports it is expected to cost about $10 to $15 a month.

Tens of thousands of Australians are reportedly already accessing foreign versions of Netflix via virtual private network technology, which alters their IP address.

DreamWorks Animation’s All Hail King Julien will be available to Australian and New Zealand viewers

Other launch titles include upcoming US television series Marvel's Daredevil

Marco Polo is also one of Neflix's original series, which is set to be available in Australia and New Zealand

The announcement comes months after Nine Entertainment Co. and Fairfax Media revealed they will be launching a new Australian subscription service next year.

StreamCo is expected to launch during the 2015 financial year.

The Netflix launch is expected to ramp up the pressure on pay-TV services such as Foxtel, which recently slashed prices in anticipation.

Yet the antipodean version is likely to lag the US version given Foxtel owns exclusive local rights to shows such as Game of Thrones.

Launch titles will include original series such as Marco Polo, BoJack Horseman and All Hail King Julien, with others such as Bloodline and Marvel's Daredevil to come later in the year.

The US-based company has also gained Australian subscription video on-demand rights to superhero television series Gotham, the Sydney Morning Herald reports.

However Nine Entertainment currently holds the broadcast, first-run, and in-season catch up rights to the Batman prequel.

As a result, Netflix will not be able to air the new show until 12 months after it has premiered on Nine.
