Dove's tagline is 'you are more beautiful than you think', so for its new Real Beauty Sketches the beauty giant used a forensic artist to prove it.

The company recruited seven women of different ages and backgrounds and asked them to describe their facial features, then enlisted FBI-trained sketch artist Gil Zamora to draw them based on their input.

The poignant video has been viewed a staggering 6.5 million times on the brands YouTube channel, making it the second most viewed YouTube video after PSY’s Gentleman.

When asked to describe themselves to Zamora, viewers can hear the women saying things like 'I kind of
have a fat, rounder face' and 'I would say I have a pretty big 
forehead.'

The two portraits, drawn from descriptions by the woman herself and a stranger, were often dramatically different and reveal women tend to underestimate their looks

A survey that showed only two percent of women worldwide would describe themselves as beautiful, prompting Dove to launch the campaign

Many of the women seem stunned when they see the stark contrast between the two drawings side-by-side

Opposing
views: Dove recruited an FBI artist to sketch women based on a description of themselves, and then a stranger's description. The results were radically different

The women were also asked to spend time with 
strangers, but neither party was told why. When asked general questions about the women, the strangers were much kinder.

'She was so thin you could see her 
cheekbones,' said one, while another man remarked 'she had nice eyes; 
they lit up when she spoke.'

FBI-trained sketch artist Gil Zamora didn't see any of the women he was drawing, working solely on information he was given verbally

Transforming self-perception: Another subject only told the artist about her flaws (center) while strangers were able to see the positives in her appearance (right) 

Dove began the first Campaign for Real Beauty in 2004, after conducting a survey that showed only two percent of women worldwide would describe themselves as beautiful.

In the two drawings are shown side-by-side, the contrast is stark - and the women seem stunned.

'She looks closed off and fatter. Sadder
too,' said one woman when asked to describe the two sketches. 'The 
other one looks more open, friendly and happy.'

Model subjects: FBI-trained forensic artist Gil Zamora sketched two composites of each woman, and the results were startling

The women seem reflective after the experience and seemed to have a new appreciation for their looks

Sadly women the women can be heard saying negative things about themselves like 'I kind of have a fat, rounder face'

After the experience, many of the women seemed to have a new appreciation for their looks - flaws and all.

'We spend a lot of time as women 
analyzing and trying to fix the things that aren't quite right,' says Florence, one of the participants.

'We 
should spend more time appreciating the things that we do like.'

Artist could not see the women, so he sketched pictures based on their descriptions of themselves

He then created a second drawing based on a stranger's description of the women. In all cases, the pictures created with stranger's input were much more attractive
