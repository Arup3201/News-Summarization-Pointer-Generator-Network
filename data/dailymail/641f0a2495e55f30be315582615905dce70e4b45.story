Arsene Wenger admits he is scarred by his Anfield humiliation last season, but does not expect a repeat from a Liverpool team struggling for goals.

Wenger’s team were four down in 20 minutes when they travelled to Merseyside in February to face a team inspired by Luis Suarez and were eventually beaten 5-1.

But the Arsenal manager believes much has changed in 10 months since, not least the exit of Suarez, an injury to Daniel Sturridge and his coup to sign Alexis Sanchez from Barcelona ahead of Brendan Rodgers.

Wenger said: 'Liverpool scored over hundred goals later year. They were very good going forward. This season they have scored 19, so they are not on the same trend offensively. They started out strong that day and we were too late to get into the game.

'Every defeat hurts, you know. Every defeat is a scar in your heart for ever. But we have good memories at Liverpool. We won many games there. A week later against the same team we won at home in the FA Cup.

'I expect to play a very good team. They have a heavy schedule like us and it’s very demanding.

'I have respect for the crowd at Liverpool because they stand behind their team. It’s one of the few grounds in the world where you see that. There is a special combination at Liverpool of knowledge of the game and support of their team.'

Wenger also revealed that he didn't have to try particularly hard to convince star signing Alexis Sanchez to move to the Emirates.

The Chile forward has scored nine goals in 16 Premier League games for the season so far and has been Wenger's most consistent performer.

The Frenchman said: 'Every great player has the choice to play where he wants and he chose us. We're very happy.

'I told him the way we play football will suit him and all players want to play in the Champions League.'
