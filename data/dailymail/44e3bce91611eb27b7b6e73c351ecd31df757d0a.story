Ricky van Wolfswinkel is in talks over a season loan to French club St Etienne. 

The 25-year-old Holland international joined Norwich for £8.5million last season from Sporting Lisbon but scored just one goal.

Van Wolfswinkel is due to have a medical with the French side looking to make the deal permanent for £4.75m.

Unsuccessful: Ricky van Wolfswinkel moved to Norwich for £8.5m but failed to live up to his reputation

Van Wolfswinkel has not played for Norwich since scoring twice in the 6-1 friendly win at Braintree, missing the club’s pre-season tour of Italy after bruising his knee in training.

Norwich are also braced for a fresh bid from QPR for Leroy Fer with cash plus Karl Henry being offered. Southampton have also expressed an interest in the midfielder.
