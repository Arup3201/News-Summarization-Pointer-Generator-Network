Binge drinking is becoming a deadly problem in the U.S. with New Mexico and Alaska topping the chart for the most alcohol-related deaths.

A new study from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has found that several mountain-region states have a higher than average number of deaths.

Figures showed that about 88,000 Americans died from drink-related causes each year, and that about 70 percent of those deaths were of working age adults.Â

Health researchers compiled information on alcohol-related deaths - from violence and car crashes to heart disease - that took place between 2006 and 2010.

New Mexico 16.4 percent

Alaska 15.9 percent

Colorado 14.2 percent

Wyoming 13.4 percent

Arizona 13.4 percent

Montana 13.2 percent

California 12.3 percent

Nevada 11.6 percent

Oregon 11.6 percent

Idaho 11.3 percent

Figures from CDC

What they found was that while the national average was one in 10 deaths that could be attributed to alcohol, states including New Mexico had far higher figures.

They found that excessive drinking was the fourth leading preventable cause of death in the U.S., and that young men were the group most likely to meet an untimely death because of drinking.

'Excessive alcohol use is a leading cause of preventable death that kills many Americans in the prime of their lives,' Ursula Bauer, of the National Center for Chronic Disease Prevention and Health Promotion, said.

'We need to redouble our efforts to implement scientifically proven public health approaches to reduce this tragic loss of life and the huge economic costs that result.'

The study looked at how binge drinking could be attributed to deaths caused by everything from liver disease and cancer to car crashes

The study counted binge drinking as more than four drinks a day for women and five for men

After New Mexico, with 16.4 percent rate, states with the highest alcohol-related deaths in the 20-64 age group were Alaska, with 15.9 percent, Colorado with 14.2 percent, and Wyoming with 13.4 percent.

Alcoholic liver disease 14,364

Liver cirrhosis 7,847

Homicide 7,756

Vehicle crashes 12,460

Poison (non alcholol) 8,404

Suicide 8,179

Fall injuries 7,541

Alcohol dependence syndrome 3,728

Alcohol abuse 2,022

Alcohol poisoning 1,647

Figures from CDC

The highest causes of deaths among all age groups including liver disease - attributed to 14,364 deaths, as well as car crashes, which accounted for 12,460 deaths, and murders, at 7,756.

Authors of the study, which was published in Preventing Chronic Disease, also accounted for fetal alcohol syndrome and child abuse.

'Excessive alcohol use is a huge public 
health problem. It's killing people in the prime of their lives,' Dr Robert Brewer, of the CDC Alcohol Program, told the Huffington Post.

The study suggested that those who had died from alcohol-related reasons had on average lost 30 years of life.

The largest age group affected was aged from 20 to 64.

A map of the U.S. that illustrates the findings showed that a line of states stretching from Montana to Arizona had above average deaths.

Health researchers say consumers need to be more aware of what constitutes 'one drink'

On the other end of the scale, Maryland residents appeared to have the healthiest attitude to drinking, with only 7.5 percent of deaths attributable to alcohol.

The study looked at 54 causes of death that could be attributed to drinking, including alcohol poisoning, liver disease, accidents, and breast cancer.

Researchers also looked at the impact of excessive drinking - more than eight drinks a week for a woman and 15 for a man - and how that affected chronic disease.

An estimated 38 million Americans drink more than the recommended weekly limit, leading other health researchers to believe that the CDC findings could be lower than the reality.

Dr David Crabb, of the Indiana Alcohol 
Research Center, told the Huffington Post: 'A lot of the injury isn't just the people you consider alcohol abusers, but a much a larger group that binge drink or consume higher levels than recommended.'
