It is the day to put fathers first, the day to tell your dad what he means to you.

But for the O'Bryne siblings, like thousands across the country, their dad is missing.

Paul O'Bryne lost his battle with a rare form of bone cancer five years ago, but his four children are determined to dedicate this Father's Day to him.

Each year as the poignant date arrives, Laura, Katie, Luke and Frankie joined by their mother Daniela put on their running shoes and take part in charity runs in honour of the chartered accountant.

Laura O'Byrne, her sister and two brothers are taking part in a charity run this Father's Day in memory of the father, Paul O'Byrne they lost to a rare form of bone cancer. On their last Father's Day together Laura and her father took part in a 10k charity run (pictured)

Mr O'Byrne, pictured with his daughter Katie, was diagnosed with the rare bone cancer Ewing's Sarcoma in April 2007. He lost his battle 18 months later in November 2008

Mr O'Byrne's four children, Frankie, 21, Katie, 28, his widow Daniela, Laura, 29 and Luke 26, have raised nearly £10,000 for Macmillan Cancer Support in the five years since his death

To date they have raised a staggering £9,500 in his memory, donating the funds to Macmillan Cancer Support, the charity who supported the family through their ordeal.

This Father's Day the charity is encouraging people to tweet a picture of their father with three words to describe him.

But for Laura O'Bryne summing her father up in three words is almost impossible.

'My dad was a character,' she said. 'He could juggle and use a unicycle, 
loved a fry-up with chips and listening to the Eagles but mostly he also
 loved running and competed in triathlons.

'Dad was unique, he was incredibly generous, very witty and always had time for people.

'He was quite bold, and liked to do things a bit differently. He was a real family man.

'He
 encouraged me to be sporty and he doted on my mum Daniela, 55, 
me, my sister Katie, 28, and brothers Luke, 26, and Frankie, 21.'

In April 2007, after suffering back pain, Mr O'Byrne was diagnosed with a very rare form of cancer - Ewing's Sarcoma, a type of bone cancer.

Despite doctors telling the family, his cancer was terminal, the father-of-four was determined to live life to the full.

Ewing's sarcoma is a primary bone cancer, which starts in the bone. 

Bone cancers are rare with only around 530 new cases diagnosed each year in the UK.

The most common bones affected are the pelvis, thigh (femur) and shins (tibia).

This sarcoma is most commonly diagnosed in teenagers and young adults but in rare cases can be seen in older people.

It is slightly more common in males than females.

Ewing's Sarcoma - named after the scientist who first described the tumour in the 1920s - can also affect the soft tissues, happening in around one in 10 cases.

The exact causes of bone cancer are unknown, but experts believe Ewing's Sarcoma could be related to rapid bone growth, explaining the high prevalence of cases in teenagers.

Pain is the most common symptom of bone cancer, though symptoms will vary depending on the position of the cancer in the body and its size.

There may be some swelling in the affected area and it may become tender to touch.

Primary bone cancer is often detected when a bone that has been weakened by the disease breaks after a minor fall or accident.

Patients diagnosed with Ewing's Sarcoma are treated at specialist hospitals because the cancer is so rare.

A combination of chemotherapy, surgery and radiotherapy is commonly used to target the tumour.

In September 2008, months before the disease claimed his life, Mr O'Bryne took the decision to stop treatment.

'Dad was having aggressive chemotherapy treatment for about a  year,' said Miss O'Bryne.

'In around April 2008 he had a scheduled break before starting maintenance chemo afterwards.

'His tumours had shrunk hugely, so the chemo had been working.

'But we always knew it was going to be terminal.

'Over the year he was having the aggressive chemo, it was really difficult on him but also on my mum and the rest of the family.

'Despite everything he was always so upbeat, from the point he was diagnosed he was really determined to make the most of it.

'As
 his tumours shrunk and he came off the aggressive treatment he had a 
couple of months where he was actually well. It was odd, but amazing at 
the same time.

'He wasn't really on any treatment and that was when my dad and I decided to do our first run together.

'Dad
 and I had always run together, it was our thing.

'My sister played 
football and we would often drop her off at the match and then go for a 
run together.

'For
 Father's Day that year we entered a 10k run to raise money for Cancer 
Backup. We had a really lovely day, I have wonderful memories of the 
run.

'It was more a jog and a chat rather than running in earnest.

'It was an amazing day, very emotional, and the last time we’d ever race together.'

As the summer progressed Mr O'Byrne's tumours began to grow again, not tamed by the maintenance levels of chemotherapy.

Mr O'Byrne lost his battle with the disease in November 2008, just 18 months after he was diagnosed. His family said they received a huge amount of support from Macmillan, praising Mr O'Byrne's Macmillan nurse Eileen Hogan who nursed him at home in his last few weeks

Under
 the care of the Royal Marsden Hospital, he was entered on to a drugs 
trial. But after completing two cycles of the test drug, it became clear
 the medication was not working.

It was then, in August 2008, that Mr O'Bryne, took the decision to stop treatment.

His daughter said: 'It was difficult, and it wasn't. He was deteriorating so quickly before our eyes.

'It
 was clear the new drug wasn't working and we had had 18 months to get 
used to the idea that dad was dying.

'Dad was unique, he was incredibly generous, very witty and always had time for people'

'That sounds terrible, but his 
prognosis was never good and we were really grateful he had that period 
of good health that we were able to enjoy together as a family.

'It was really hard but almost immediately Macmillan were there to help. A nurse came to visit the next day, she was brilliant, she was great with all the family and quickly got the measure of dad.

'She was open and honest with us all, something dad really appreciated.

'Thank God for Eileen Hogan who nursed him in the last six weeks of his life and helped him to die at home.

'As a family we obviously found it incredibly difficult. Katie and I moved home so we were all together as a family.

'We felt well equipped to deal with what was happening and to keep him at home, something he was adamant he wanted.'

Mr O'Byrne passed away at the family's North London home in November 2008. 

Knowing Father's Day without their dad 
would be tough, the family decided to do something positive in his 
memory, carrying on his love of running.

They all signed up to run in memory of Mr O'Byrne on Father's Day in 2010.

Laura O'Byrne said: 'Dad was unique, he was incredibly generous, very witty and always had time for people. He was quite bold, and liked to do things a bit differently. He was a real family man'

'It was very emotional and we ran with pictures of Dad on our back. It was particularly tough for Mum who isn’t sporty,' said Laura.

'Afterwards,
 we went to Dad’s grave where we hung our medals on it. It felt like he 
was looking down on us and would’ve been proud.'

This is the fifth year raising money for the cancer charity, having raised nearly £10,000 to date.

'It is a brilliant legacy to dad,' added Laura. 'He would've loved to see us all out running together and know that so many people have donated in his memory.

His daughter Laura, said: 'Right from the very start we had a huge amount of support from Macmillan and the charity, Cancer Backup, which is now a part of Macmillan.

'They were there with advice, support, how to break it to your family. Dad always wanted to know everything and be in control of his disease as much as possible.'
