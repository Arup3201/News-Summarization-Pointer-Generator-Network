A woman's £300,000 collection of napkins has made her a record-breaker for the fourth time.

Antonia Kozakova has amassed 62,757 individual designs, which she keeps piled up in her office.

The Slovakian has taken 16 years to create her collection - that includes examples from countries all over the world.

Quite the collection! Antonia Kozakova, 39, has a collection of 62,757 napkins that are worth in the region of £300,000 that she has amassed from around the world

The 39-year-old first set the world record in 2007 when her collection hit 21,000.

Since then, she's broken her own record twice more - in 2008 with 30,300 napkins and again in 2008 with 50,000.

Now the collection has almost reached the 63,000 mark, Mrs Kozakova has once again become a record-breaker.

The eclectic collection, thought to be worth in the region of £300,000, includes one tiny napkin that is just two-inches long, while the largest design stretches to almost four ft.

One of the eldest designs dates back to the 1940s.

 hobby.'

Mrs Kozakova says she has no plans to stop collecting and already has her sights on reaching 100,000.

She added: 'I want to have a napkin with my face and name on it.

'And I'm still looking for one signed by my favourite actor Arnold Schwarzenegger.'
