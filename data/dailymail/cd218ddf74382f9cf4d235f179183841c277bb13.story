Karen McCann, 59, claimed just £443 in legitimate income between 2008 and April this year, but paid off her mortgage and went on expensive holidays

A school cleaner  has been jailed for three years and four months after running a £150,000-a-year cannabis farm from her home.

Karen McCann, 59, from Leicester, paid off her mortgage and went on £6,000 holidays despite declaring only £443 legitimate income between March 2008 and April this year, a court heard.

When police raided her home in March they found £18,448 in cash, along with 66 cannabis plants growing in a bedroom and loft, and a complex hydration system along with fans and heat lamps.

Leicester Crown Court was told the plants could yield more than 7lb of high-potency cannabis per crop, worth around £37,600, with four harvests annually.

Jonathan Cox, prosecuting, said McCann used the money to pay off the mortgage on the home she bought in 2004.

He said: 'There was evidence of a lavish lifestyle and documents at the premises related to a £6,000 holiday in Spain.'

The road where McCann lives in Leicester has properties worth an average of £94,000. 

Mr Cox added: 'She accepts it was going on since early 2012. The annual yield would have been thirteen kilograms, fetching just over £150,000.'

'She wasn’t paying for any electricity, and saved thousands, because the meter was by-passed.

'It was done in a particularly dangerous manner, creating a fire risk. Cannabis separated into individual deals was also found in the airing cupboard.'

McCann, a former dinner lady, admitted producing cannabis, abstracting electricity, possessing £18,448 of criminal property and money laundering. 

She told the court that she had not been claiming benefits while growing the Class B drug, and said she had been 'emotionally manipulated' into it by her former partner.

McCann was convicted in 2007 for permitting her premises to be used for producing cannabis  - involving the same former partner - and was given a conditional discharge on that occasion.

However, Judge Simon Hammond said: 'I believe this defendant went into this with her eyes open.

'Cannabis farms and factories are very prevalent and provide huge profits.

When police raided McCann's house they found 66 cannabis plants growing in a bedroom and the loft, along with a sophisticated hydration system, fans and heat lamps. They also found more than £18,000 in cash

McCann worked as a dinner lady at Merrydale Junior School until 2007 when she was convicted of allowing her home to be used to grow cannabis. She then worked as the school cleaner until she was caught again this year

'In one year alone 47 cannabis factories were discovered in Leicester and these systems produce cannabis with very high THC, known as skunk.

'Skunk can cause serious mental health problems and is much stronger than cannabis that used to be imported from Morocco and other countries.'

Sian Cutter, mitigating, said McCann’s previous partner had used her home and bank accounts to run the operation - although when she was arrested she refused to say who else was involved.

McCann worked as a dinner lady at Merrydale Junior School in Leicester for 18 years until she was convicted in 2007, after which she went back to work at the school as a cleaner. 

Miss Cutter claimed her former partner later reconciled with her and persuaded her to give up work, promising to look after her financially.

He put money into her bank account from legitimate profits from a cafe he owned, said Miss Cutter.

But later he allegedly persuaded her to let him install another growing operation in her home, the court was told.
