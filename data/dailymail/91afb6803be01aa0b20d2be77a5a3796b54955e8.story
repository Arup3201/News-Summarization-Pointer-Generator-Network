Former Chancellor Alistair Darling warned the risks of independence are 'bigger' than the banking crash

Scottish independence would cause more damage to the UK than the banking crash in 2008, Alistair Darling has warned.

The former Chancellor said the risks of Scotland going it alone ‘are colossal’ and there will be no going back.

And he warned allegations that Alex Salmond’s pro-independence campaign is intimidating business from speaking out brings ‘shame on our country’.

Voters in Scotland will decide whether Scotland should become an independent country in an historic referendum on September 18.

With less than three months to go, the battle between the two camps has become increasingly bitter.

Support for independence has remained flat, or fallen, despite Mr Salmond’s team stepping the push for breaking up the Union.

In an interview with The Independent, Mr Darling said voters’ minds are starting to focus on the idea of Scotland leaking the UK, and they do not like it.

‘People can now see the finishing post,’ he said. ‘In 2012 and 2013, the referendum wasn't really real. It was like asking someone the day after a general election, how they would vote at the next election - it was a completely free hit.’

He said the ‘sheer magnitude of the decision’ is looming large in people's minds.

‘It's not like a general or Euro election, when you can vote for somebody else next time around. This is probably the biggest political decision they will ever take in their lives.

‘More and more people are saying the risks are colossal and there is no guarantee whatsoever that there would be anything to gain from it. That's why people are saying: 'I am not buying this'.’

Mr Darling, who was Chancellor in the Labour government when the banking crisis hit in 2008, said the ramifications of independence would be even greater.

The UK taxpayer spent £66billion bailing out failing banks, including Royal Bank of Scotland and Lloyds.

‘Being told the world's largest bank has three hours before it collapses does provide a shock to the system,’ Mr Darling.

‘But the decision on Scotland is forever. It's irrevocable, irreversible. If we get it wrong, it will have a profound effect, not just on Scotland, but the rest of the UK. 

'The stakes in the banking crisis were big; this is so much bigger.’

Tensions have been rising in the campaign over allegations the Scottish government has sought to silence business who support the Union.

Five company bosses told the Channel 4 Dispatches show they were contacted by the Scottish Government and ‘felt pressurised to stay quiet about their views’, while the former chief executive of the Scotch Whisky Association said SNP Westminster leader Angus Robertson had tried to ‘neuter business comment’.

Last week, Prime Minister David Cameron also accused the Nationalists of making ‘threats and warnings’ to businesses.

Mr Darling added: ‘It is shining a light on Scotland that frankly brings shame on our country. When I first heard about it over two years ago, I did not believe it. Now people are speaking out because it is happening to so many people.

‘What worries me is that, if Scotland became independent, the same people doing these things would be in government. It strikes at the heart of the campaign and the conduct of public life. It should not be tolerated.’

Alex Salmond has been accused of trying to 'intimidate' one of Scotland's most senior industry leaders as the SNP 'bullying' scandal deepened last night.

Bertie Armstrong, chief executive of the Scottish Fishermen's Federation, claimed the First Minister made a 'wholly unacceptable' attempt to silence him when he posed questions about independence.

Mr Armstrong described a personal letter from Mr Salmond as an 'attempt to snarl hard enough at us to intimidate us from asking further questions'.

The accusation, which has been strenuously denied by the Scottish Government, comes after a TV documentary last night highlighted similar claims of threatening behaviour by ministers.

Five company bosses told the Channel 4 Dispatches show they were contacted by the Scottish Government and 'felt pressurised to stay quiet about their views', while the former chief executive of the Scotch Whisky Association said SNP Westminster leader Angus Robertson had tried to 'neuter business comment'.

Last week, Prime Minister David Cameron also accused the Nationalists of making 'threats and warnings' to businesses.

Mr Armstrong wrote to Mr Salmond in May after the SNP leader used a speech in Belgium to suggest that foreign fishermen would be banned from an independent Scotland's waters unless European governments met his demands on EU membership.

The head of Britain's diplomatic service has warned that Scots may have to pay for emergency help abroad ifthe country becomes independent.

Simon Fraser, the top official at the Foreign and Commonwealth Office, said the scale of the UK's embassy network would dwarf the set-up for a separate Scotland.

At present, UK consular staff around the world deal with hundreds of thousands of inquiries from members of thepublic every year.

The cost of maintaining the global consular operation is largely met from a small charge added to the cost ofevery new British passport. But if there is a Yes vote, a Scottish passport will be created.

Should Scotland become an EU member, European rules mean citizens would be entitled to assistance from any member state in a country where Scotland was unrepresented.

However, the level of aid offered by EU countries varies and citizens of the country in question receive priority treatment.

Mr Fraser, permanent under-secretary at the Foreign and Commonwealth Office, said there could also be costs attached.

He added: 'We have 216 consular posts in 144 countries. They offer assistance to all UK citizens. Last year, we helped 400,000 people.

'The Scottish Government is planning a network of 70-90 diplomatic posts, plus a network of honorary consuls. Where a country has any form of representation, including an honorary consul, it must look after its own citizens.'

'The alternative - the fishing fleets of 12 countries being denied any access to Scottish waters and as a consequence, their access to Norwegian waters... is clearly absurd,' Mr Salmond said at the time.

On behalf of the country's fishermen, Mr Armstrong wrote to the First Minister: 'That would be contrary to the principle of innocent passage laid down in the law of the sea - will you explain what you meant by this?' Mr Salmond's response, which came to light yesterday, states: 'I thought such a ridiculous interpretation would be confined to [Scotland's only Tory MP] David Mundell... I find it astonishing that anyone else would follow this interpretation.'

Mr Armstrong told the Scottish Daily Mail yesterday the response was 'unacceptably dismissive' and he added: 'This looks to me to be an attempt to intimidate.' He also told the BBC: 'Rough treatment doesn't bother me in the slightest but it just didn't answer the questions.

'It therefore seemed like something of a warning or something of an attempt at intimidation about asking questions, pursufeatured ing the questions that we asked or asking any further ones.'

But a spokesman for Mr Salmond said: 'Mr Armstrong wrote to the First Minister, who responded with a detailed, factual letter on EU fishing rights. 'That letter has been in the public domain for weeks - nothing in it could remotely be described as intimidating and we urge people to read it for themselves to see that.' The row comes amid ongoing claims of intimidation, which heavily in the Dispatches programme.

Gavin Hewitt, former chief executive of the Scotch Whisky Association, said he or senior members of his staff met Angus Robertson on at least six occasions over the past two years.

'He was, I think, trying to neuter business comment,' Mr Hewitt told the programme.

'There was a genuine fear that if we were seen to scupper by coming out publicly against independence, there would be retribution down the track.' But Mr Robertson said last night: 'I totally refute the allegations, especially given that both Gavin Hewitt and his successor [David] Frost have both said to me they don't take a position on constitutional issues.

'Mr Hewitt publicly endorsed the case for a No vote last month, which he is perfectly entitled to do. What is a matter for me, and what I am very clear about, is that there is nothing in my conduct which answers to Mr Hewitt's description.'
