Radamel Falcao is fit enough to withstand the rigours of the Barclays Premier League and is ready to give his all for Manchester United, according to his wife, Lorelei Taron. 

United manager Louis van Gaal's is becoming increasingly frustrated at not having his striker fully fit and that was evident at the weekend.

Van Gaal said Falcao was in the squad for the match at Southampton on Monday 'in spite of the fact he can only play 20 minutes at this level because the rhythm of the game in the Premier League is the highest.'

Louis van Gaal had previously said that Falcao was only ready to play 20 minutes a game for United

But the Colombia centre forward's wife Taron went on her Instagram account to pour scorn on Van Gaal's assertion. 

Alongside a picture of Falcao in United training attire the caption read simply: '100% ready to give everything !!!'

Falcao has yet to discover the prodigious goalscoring touch he is renowned for, finding the net only once in seven appearances at United.

He came on as a 78th-minute substitute during their last match, the home victory over Stoke. 

But if Monday's game at St Mary's sees United's resurgence continue with their fifth consecutive win, they will move above Southampton and into third in the Premier League.

However, if Falcao does play a part he will be up against the top-flight's best defence.

Southampton have conceded a measly 10 League goals, thanks to a back four who have barely changed all season.

So Jose Fonte and Maya Yoshida are likely to be the centre halves against whom Falcao is likely to line up.

And then Van Gaal will have a better idea of how ready the Colmbia star is.
