Calorie counts are set to be put on alcoholic drinks in a bid to frighten drinkers – particularly women – into cutting down.

Most manufacturers already include information on units of alcohol on labels in a voluntary agreement with the Government, which now wants to extend this to calories.

The hope is that appealing to people’s concerns about putting on weight will change drinking habits.

The calorie count of alcoholic drinks could be displayed in pubs and shops under plans to warn people about how fattening booze can be

Among the glaring examples that will 
concern those watching their waistlines is a 175ml glass of wine, which 
has almost the same number of calories – 130 – as two digestive 
biscuits, while a pint of lager at 250 is equivalent to eating a slice 
of pizza.

A survey by charity DrinkAware revealed people’s ignorance of calories in alcohol.

Half of those polled knew how many 
calories there are in a cheeseburger but just one in three were able to 
answer as regards a glass of wine.

The calorie count idea has the support
of Public Health Minister Anna Soubry, who has issued a series of blunt
messages about the dangers of obesity.

The Government has established a 
number of so-called Responsibility Deals with the food and drink 
industry to encourage voluntary measures to improve the health of their 
products and provide extra information to the public.

Retailers including Asda, Sainsbury’s 
and Tesco are working with the Department of Health on how to display 
calorie counts on alcohol. Mrs Soubry said: ‘By the end of this year, 80
per cent of all alcoholic drinks on shop shelves will include clear 
labelling on units and health messages.’

The coalition government has repeatedly ruled out using the law to force food and drink firms to give more information to customers.

But using Responsibility Deals it has reached voluntary agreements with leading producers to make clearer how healthy what they sell is.

Dozens of companies including McDonald’s,
KFC and Pizza Hut signed up to a deal to provide calorie information on
menus for non-alcohol food and drink.

Now the warnings could go further and be added to beer and wine on sale in shops and even pubs.

A glass of wine has almost the same number of calories as four cookies while a pint of lager is equivalent to a slice of pizza.

A single 25ml measure of spirits has more calories (56kcal) than the same amount of single cream (47kcal), the government warns.

A gin and tonic contains 126 calories, a bottle of white wine 555 and a pint of lager or cider around 250.

Experts also point out that drinkers also tend to eat high-fat snacks like crisps, nuts, chips and kebabs.

A Department of Health survey in 2009 found that one in three people ordered crisps, nuts or pork scratchings with an alcohol drink.

The average wine drinker consumes an extra 2,000 calories a month, equivalent to 38 roast beef dinners a year.

A survey by Drinkaware, backed by TV presenter Lisa Faulkner, found people have no idea how many calories are in alcoholic drinks despite pledges to lose weight

The government negotiated new EU rules
to allow for ‘at-a-glance voluntary nutrition information in a wide 
variety of settings’ including on alcohol.

Mrs
Soubry, Public Health Minister said:  ‘We're continuing to work with 
industry to take forward the plans we set out in the alcohol strategy on
labelling of alcoholic drinks.

‘By
the end of this year, 80 per cent of all alcoholic drinks on shop 
shelves will include clear labelling on units and health messages.

‘Through
the Responsibility Deal we will continue to discuss how to give 
consumers more information on alcoholic drinks, including calorie 
labelling.’

Retailers including Asda, Sainsbury’s and Tesco are working with the Department of Health on how to display calorie counts on alcohol. The Co-Op already includes some calorie information on its own brand beer, wine, cider and spirits.

The Alcohol  Network of the Responsibility Deal is  ‘looking to develop further pledges which  could also support calorie reduction’.

As part of a deal with the government, Heineken agreed to reduce the strength of a major brand of beer, removing 100m units of alcohol from our consumption each  year – the equivalent of 5.6bn calories. Now ministers want to develop  similar pledges.
