Fox News anchor Megyn Kelly credits Dr Phil with changing her life.

Ms Kelly said that he inspired her to leave her high-paying lawyer position for a $17,000 journalism job, at the Fortune Most Powerful Women in Business conference in California on Tuesday.

The 43-year-old revealed that a quote from the talk-show host convinced her to adopt a 'settle for more' philosophy with regard to both her career and marriage, during an interview with Facebook COO Sheryl Sandberg.

'Back in the day when I was unhappily married and unhappily working, I heard a brilliant man by the name of Dr. Phil say the only difference between you and someone you envy is you settled for less,' Ms Kelly said.

'It just spoke to me like, "Yes, that's exactly right!" So, settle for more. That was me.'

She went on to explain how she put the newfound philosophy into practice, claiming, 'It really did change my life.'

'Instead of wasting energy sitting around looking at someone who I admired and thinking, "Oh, God, she's got it all. Why can't I have it all? She's on TV. Oh, I would love that job. She seems so happily married. I wish I were happily married," I just started to change my life little by little,' she said.

After nine years as a corporate litigator at the firm Jones Day, she broke into journalism with the help of a female reporter in Chicago she met in guitar class. 

Ms Kelly served as a general assignment reporter for ABC affiliate WJLA-TV before joining Fox News Channel as a Washington-based correspondent in 2004.

She also revealed how Dr Phil's advice helped her seek a more fulfilling personal life.

'I had a very sweet, loving husband who was a doctor, but I knew I wasn't happy and we divorced amicably. And I wound up meeting a man who was unlike any other man I ever met before,' said Ms Kelly, who married author Douglas Brunt in 2008 after her divorce from anesthesiologist Daniel Kendall two years earlier.

Ms Kelly's highly rated primetime news program, The Kelly File, debuted a year ago this week.

Earlier this year, she was named one of Time magazine's 100 most influential people in the world.
