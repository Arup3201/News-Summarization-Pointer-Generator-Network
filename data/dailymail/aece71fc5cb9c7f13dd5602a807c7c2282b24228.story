One of Britain’s most senior Roman Catholics has sparked fury by suggesting an MP and former minister died because he was gay.

The new Archbishop of Glasgow, Philip Tartaglia, said society had kept ‘very quiet’ about the death of Labour MP and former Scotland Office minister David Cairns.

Mr Cairns, a former Catholic priest himself, died in May last year at the age of 44 from acute pancreatitis.

But Bishop Tartaglia questioned why his body ‘just shut down’.

At a conference on religious freedom 
held at Oxford University, he said: ‘If what I have heard is true about 
the relationship between the physical and mental health of gay men, then
 society is being very quiet about it.

‘Recently in Scotland, there was a 
gay Catholic MP who died at the age of 44 or so, and nobody said 
anything, and why his body just shut down at that age.

‘Obviously he could have had a disease that would have killed anybody.

‘But you seem to hear so many stories
 about this kind of thing, but society won’t address it.’ A source close
 to David Cameron said the Prime Minister believed the Archbishop’s 
remarks were ‘totally unacceptable’.

Mr Cairns’s partner of 15 years, 
Dermot Kehoe, accused him of delivering a ‘hate speech’, and said the 
comments had added to his grief.

Mr Kehoe said the bishop’s ‘ignorance
 and prejudice should not go unchallenged’. He wrote on Twitter: 
‘Tartaglia’s comments are hate speech. He has position of moral 
leadership and should not speak from ignorance of the facts... 
Distressing and painful.’

A spokesman for Archbishop Tartaglia said his words had been ‘taken out of context’ and had been made in a lecture 14 weeks ago.

He said he had been asked a question 
‘which was not related to his speech. In his reply he mentioned a 
situation he had been closely involved in, namely the funeral 
arrangements for the late David Cairns.

‘The Archbishop knew David 
Cairns, met him regularly at events in Inverclyde, and got on well with 
him, and was personally involved in his funeral arrangements.

He is 
sorry for any hurt which has resulted, there was certainly no offence or
 judgment intended in his words.’

But Mr Kehoe rejected the apology and
 accused the Archbishop of using the situation to ‘influence the 
Government’ to stop its plans for same-sex marriage. Labour Leader Ed 
Miliband, who was visiting Edinburgh yesterday, said the Archbishop’s 
comments had caused hurt.

‘I think, knowing the circumstances 
of what actually happened to David, he will recognise that his comments 
were wrong,’ he said.

Shadow Home Secretary Yvette Cooper 
wrote on Twitter: ‘Comments from Archbishop of Glasgow on the much 
missed David Cairns are deeply wrong, shocking and distressing. Hope he 
will now withdraw.’ Mr Cairns successfully fought to overturn a 19th 
Century law and become the first former Catholic priest to become an MP.

He remained a devout Catholic 
throughout his life and represented the constituency where he was born, 
Greenock in the west of Scotland.

He was the first minister to exit 
Gordon Brown’s government, in September 2008, after becoming 
disillusioned with his leadership.He also piloted legislation to protect
 shop workers from being forced to work on Sundays.

His death, after a short but painful 
illness, came just weeks after he was admitted to hospital suffering 
from acute pancreatitis.

Former Prime Minister Tony Blair read a eulogy at a mass held in his honour in London.

Mr Brown, along with MPs from across the political divide, attended the ceremony.
