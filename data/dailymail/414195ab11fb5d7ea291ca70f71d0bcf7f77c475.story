Horrific: At least eight mourners were killed as this suspension bridge in northern Vietnam collapsed suddenly

In the video, mourners are first seen beginning to cross the bridge on the way to a graveyard

Police officer Phung Quang Tuyen said cables on one side of the year-old bridge in Lai Chau province's Tam Duong district snapped, causing the group to fall about 20 metres (65ft) on to rocks.

He said 23 of the injuries were serious following the collapse on Monday.

The coffin containing the body of a village official was thrown into the shallow stream, he said.

leaving moruners to drop 20 metres (65ft) below on to a rocky terrain

Those involved, on either side of the bridge and below, can be heard screaming after the sudden collapse

Police officer Phung Quang Tuyen said: 'It was a horrible scene. People were screaming and crying'

‘It was a horrible scene,’ Mr Tuyen said. ‘People were screaming and crying.’

An investigation into the cause of the accident is underway, Mr Tuyen said.

The
 online VnExpress newspaper quoted Nguyen Vuong Chien, administrator of 
the provincial traffic safety board, as saying vibrations from the 
funeral procession may have set off a resonance in the bridge, causing 
the cable to break.
