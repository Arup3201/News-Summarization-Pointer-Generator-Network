A terrified patient woke up in 'agony' during an operation being performed by an HIV-positive dentist who was later struck off the register.

Donald Richardson claims he could have contracted the virus after he was given a general anaesthetic by disgraced Paisley dentist Harry Robertson - who wasn’t even qualified to knock people out.

Robertson was struck off the dental register in July for lying about having HIV.

Mr 
Richardson, 52, requested the anaesthetic for a 2007 root canal 
treatment and fillings because of his fear of needles and so paid £100 
in advance for a specialist anaesthetist to visit and ensure he was not 
awake.

Patient Donald Richardson said he was 'frozen with fear' when he woke up during the root canal procedure

But after a 40 minute wait the anaesthetist failed to turn up and Robertson took the situation into his own hands.

Half an hour in to the procedure, he woke up in intense pain before Robertson rushed to give him more anaesthetic.

He said: 'You can imagine my horror when I woke up to find him still working in my mouth. I was in agony.'

He now faces an HIV test with his doctor with more needles and has complained to the NHS.

Robertson refused to comment when confronted at his Glasgow home, despite some of his former patients remaining un-traced for HIV tests.

Mr Richardson said: 'When I read about this doctor hiding his HIV from patients I was horrified.

'He put my life at risk by doing the anaesthetic himself and I will pursue him legally as far as I can take it now.

'Not only will I have to go through a test for HIV where I’ll have to face a needle but I now know that this man wasn’t even qualified to perform a general anaesthetic on me which is more worrying.

'This is a complicated procedure even for a qualified anaesthetist because if you don’t get the levels right you can kill someone.

'I sat in the waiting room for 40 minutes but he didn’t turn up. He took me into his room, sat me on the chair and administered it himself.

'I had no idea what was going on and I was completely knocked out.

'When I woke up half-way through he then got this massive needle and injected more anaesthetic into my gums.

'I was frozen with fear and I’ll never forget that day for the rest of my life.

'On the way out he handed me the £100 back but it was such a terrible experience I never went back to him.

'This guy had obviously given me too little of the stuff and I woke up in the middle of it all. He could just as easily have given me too much and killed me.

'To lie about having HIV is bad enough but to carry out life-threatening procedures without being properly qualified is out of order.

'I’m absolutely terrified of having an HIV test, not because I fear I may have HIV, but because I will have to face a needle.'

A spokesperson for NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde said the vast majority of Robertson's patients had been contacted to inform them of his HIV-status.

'There were people who we could not trace because they had moved from the area and we conducted a public awareness campaign in the hope these people would present for testing.

'Ultimately, however, it was down to a personal decision by individuals on whether to respond to our appeal for testing.

'Some 10,000 people have been tested and not a single person was found to have caught HIV as a result of medical or dental treatment.'
