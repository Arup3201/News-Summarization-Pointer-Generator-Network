Eric Garner's daughter believes it was not racism but pride that led officer Daniel Pantaleo to choke her father to death.

Protesters chanting 'black lives matter' have stormed the streets of New York for days since a grand jury refused to charge Pantaleo over Garner's death last July.

But his daughter Erica Garner dismissed the anti-racism chants, saying: 'This is not a black and white issue. This is a national crisis.'

Pride not racism: Erica Garner said she thinks Daniel Pantaleo killed her father in a chokehold to be 'top cop'

Protests: Thousands have taken to the streets to protest racism after a grand jury refused to indict Pantaleo

She continued: 'It was about the officer's pride. It was about my father being 6'4" and 350 pounds and he wants to be the top cop that brings a man down.'

Pressed by CNN's Don Lemon on whether race played a part in her father's death, Erica responded: 'I really doubt it'.

She said she will never forgive officer Pantaleo and called on him to admit guilt.

The interview on Thursday came amid national outcry over the grand jury decision to indict neither Pantaleo nor Darren Wilson, who shot dead unarmed black teenager Michael Brown in Ferguson, Missouri, on August 9 this year.

And even former president George W Bush remarked that he felt it is 'it's sad that race continues to play such...an emotional, divisive part of life.' 

'I thought how sad. The verdict was hard to understand,' Bush told CNN's Candy Crowley in a clip on an interview the network plans to air during Crowley's show on Sunday, adding that he 'hadn't seen all the details.'

Police arrested 223 people in New York City on Thursday night and into Friday morning as protesters took to the street for the second night of demonstrations.

Demonstrators also turned out in cities including Washington D.C., Seattle, Atlanta and Oakland a day after the decision not to charge Officer Daniel Pantaleo for his role in the July incident.

Although there have been no reports of violence from protesters, police made a number of arrests as scores of demonstrators shut down traffic on the Brooklyn and Manhattan bridges.

Many arrests were made in Times Square, where police pushed back against protesters just before 11pm, and others were later arrested at Eighth Avenue and 51st Street and at Madison Avenue and 57th Street, ABC7 reported.

Anger: Police are bracing themselves for days, if not weeks, of continued unrest in New York and elsewhere

Mass outcry: The grand jury verdict came after a similar decision in Ferguson, Missouri, over Michael Brown

Eric Garner's case converged with the Ferguson shooting and investigations out of South Carolina and Cleveland to stir a national conversation about racial justice and police use of force. 

On Facebook, a page used to aggregate protests in New York City listed plans well into the days and weeks ahead.

Two rallies and a candlelight vigil were planned for later on Friday, while Saturday featured a rally in Brooklyn against police brutality.

The case and that of Akai Gurley, shot dead by a rookie NYPD officer in Brooklyn, has sparked national debate

Police arrested 223 people on Thursday night and into Friday morning on the second day of demonstrations

Saturday's plans included a rally protesting the case of Akai Gurley, an unarmed black man shot and killed by a New York police officer last month in the stairwell of a public housing project.

The Brooklyn District Attorney said on Friday that a grand jury would look into the case.

Police officials have said the officer's gun may have discharged by accident when he was patrolling a dark stairwell.

More long term, plans call for 'a week of outrage' at Union Square Park starting on Monday and a march in Washington on December 13.
