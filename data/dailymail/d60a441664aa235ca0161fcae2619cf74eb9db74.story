Paul Scholes has warned against Manchester United spending £34million on Luke Shaw as he would rather the club spend that amount of money on a striker who would score 30 goals a season.

In his latest Paddy Power blog, the Red Devils legend lamented England's World Cup performance - highlighting the damage the influx of foreign players has had on the Premier League detrimentally.

The 39-year-old has baulked at the 
Premier League's influx of foreign players - labelling England's top 
flight as a 'cash cow' - as prices of young English talent continue to 
inflate and therefore stifling their opportunities to develop as club's 
opt for cheaper foreign imports.

Unimpressed: Scholes thinks signing Shaw will reduce the chances of young English talent coming through

The 39-year-old cites the value of Shaw as evidence of premium prices on homegrown 
stars and would rather United spend that money on a top-class forward.

'The 
proposed £34m transfer for the 18-year-old Luke Shaw to Manchester 
United is another example of something which has a bad long-term 
impact,' he said.

'Clubs are priced out of this market which is why they go abroad for cheap options - they’re not better players.

'For
 a left-back to be worth £34m shows how silly the game has gone. For 
that money I want a centre-forward who’s going to score 30 goals a 
season.'

Shaw has been heavily linked with a summer move to Old Trafford, following another impressive season at Southampton.

The 18-year-old's display's earned him a place in Roy Hodgson's disappointing World Cup squad - where he started in Tuesday's Group D 0-0 dead rubber draw against Costa Rica.
