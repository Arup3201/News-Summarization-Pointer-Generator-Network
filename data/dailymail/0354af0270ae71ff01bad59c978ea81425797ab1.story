 'Mad Dog' Allen returns with the latest installment of his weekly 
column for MailOnline Sport. The Barnet boss does not hold back with his
 views on current issues in football.

WHERE WAS JOHN TERRY?

I've no idea what has happened behind the scenes regarding John Terry and England.

Conversations must have taken place and decisions made about him not being a part of the national team because any manager would want his best 11 players on the pitch for the big games.

No doubt there have been some difficult relationship issues behind the scenes.

Sun-soacked: While England were being knocked out of the World Cup, John Terry was on holidays with his wife Toni

Missed: Terry played 78 times in an England shirt and would have been an asset again if available for Brazil

However, Terry was the best English centre back in the Barclays Premier League last season, without a shadow of a doubt.

He played practically every game in the league for Chelsea and went about his business quietly and efficiently.Terry would’ve been an absolute banker to be starting in the England team in every game we played in the World Cup.

I'm sure with mediation between the 
Football Association, Roy Hodgson and the captain Steven Gerrard, 
problems could've been sorted out.

Still the one: Terry was the best English centre back in the Premier League last season

Down and out: Despondent England captain Steven Gerrard and coach Roy Hodgson face the press on Sunday

Of course John would've had to respect the choice of leader but I'm sure at the World Cup he would have been adaptable and supportive and, more than anything, helpful for Gerrard in captaining our country.

Terry's presence, authority, body language and karma in the big games would've most definitely improved our team.

NOW IS THE TIME TO BACK ROY HODGSON

I sat watching England versus Uruguay at three o'clock in the morning in the chef's kitchen on the only television at a yoga spa retreat in Thailand.

The chef was watching it with me and we both had our England shirts on in a place in the jungle that you can only get to by boat.

I actually thought England played well; there was bound to be anxiety in what was the biggest game in a lot of those players' careers.

Disappointment: Roy Hodgson's England may have bowed out in the group, but the team did their country proud

I sat with the chef disappointed and saddened but I still think the team put a shift in and had a real go.

After visiting South Africa as an England supporter in 2010 and watching Fabio Capello's team not turn up, and not do our country proud, I thought this was a very different performance.

I'm pleased younger players have been given an opportunity and I'm pleased Hodgson has tried to get the team to play from the back and pass the ball more, which everybody has wanted for years.

Now it's time to back the manager's judgment and let him lead the transition by bringing in more younger, fresher faces to play alongside those who have now got big tournament experience.

Hodgson is a fine ambassador, you can tell that he has the respect of the players.

It is disappointing but it is not, for me, all doom and dismay.

GIVE HOCKY A CHANCE

Yes, it's a gamble. Yes, I understand all Leeds fans will be sceptical. But their new manager David Hockaday is a good guy.

He is honest, hard-working, very professional and he will get his team to play passing football out from the back and through midfield to attack.

David has been my assistant three times at different clubs over the years so I've witnessed his work first-hand.

Of course, only time will tell if the appointment works.

Most managers nowadays are only lasting 14 months tops, so who is to say he is the wrong man for the job?

The last man in charge, Brian McDermott, got Reading into the Premier League and for some reason the owner didn't think he was good enough.

He brought through loads of good young players and hardly spent a pound note and still he was sacked.

Not enough: Brian McDermott (left) was sacked by new owner Massimo Cellino (right) after doing little wrong

I urge all Leeds supporters to get behind the team, as, at the end of the day, it is the team that counts, not whoever the bloke is in the technical area.

Clubs are chopping and changing, and there is no doubt the old life in football management is well and truly Mad.

But give David Hockaday a chance.

MY WEEK...

I've been in Thailand on holiday and, as I mentioned earlier, went out to a luscious yoga spa retreat in the middle of nowhere.

The evening after the England defeat to Uruguay I sat in the dining room with all the happy hippies and it did make me smile when a dude – and that is the only way to describe him – from Norway, with his body covered in tattoos, a goatee, a pony tail and dressed in what looked my granddad's pyjamas, got his guitar out and started the evening's entertainment with the theme tune of this place: Puff the Magic Dragon.

I've never seen so many happy teetotallers in all my life.

It certainly helped take my mind off England's nightmare World Cup.
