A bride was stranded beside a motorway in China after clambering out of her white limo for a quick pre-wedding toilet break.

Named in a report as 26-year-old Zhang Han, the wife-to-be's big day turned into a nightmare when the incident unfolded during a toll booth traffic jam in Henan province.

Unable to wait any longer, the woman reportedly climbed out of her elaborate chauffeur-driven limousine for a pit stop and told her driver she could catch a lift with the groom.

But when she returned, both her limo and the groom's car had made it through the toll booths an vanished.

She had told the groom to wait for her, but he was busy paying the toll and didn't know what was happening, according to China's People's Daily. 

Having left everything on the seat - bridal dresses seldom come with pockets - she wandered along the side of the motorway until she could track down a traffic officer.

She then had to phone the groom, who realised his mistake and fetched her - leaving hundreds of guests waiting for her big moment.

According to the Central European News agency, the bride told an unidentified TV channel: 'I was nervous and wanted to go to the bathroom, so when we turned up at the toll station I told the driver I was going to use the toilet, and told him to wait for me.

'He told me that he was not allowed to wait as he had to go through the toll now that he was in the queue, and so I told him not to wait and I would travel along with other guests.' 

The agency claimed the toilet break took longer than the bride had expected - because of all the folds in her gown.
