A London garage located near the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge’s home is set to become one of the most expensive places in the world to park after it was put up for sale for £500,000.

The ‘substantial and secure’ garage - with a door measuring 8ft 5in wide and 9ft 2in high - is tucked away on Canning Place Mews, which is a 10-minute walk from Kensington Palace in Central London.

Stretching back 17ft 9in, it is said to be large enough to accommodate a Bentley Continental or Range Rover - but is around £100,000 more than the average price of a home in London.

Good location: The 'substantial and secure' garage - with a door measuring 8ft 5in wide and 9ft 2in high - is tucked away on Canning Place Mews, which is a 10-minute walk from Kensington Palace in Central London

Up for sale: It is being offered leasehold and only has 92 years left - with any buyer expected to pay a further £300 per year in ground rent and maintenance charges

The garage is also almost three times the £172,000 paid on average for a home in England and Wales last month. If the 279 sq ft lock-up sells for its asking price, it will work out at £1,792 per sq ft.

For the same price as the garage, you could get a 28-bedroom country mansion in Devon, a picturesque cottage in the Cotswolds or an equestrian centre in Scotland.

The 34,250 sq ft three-storey mansion in Devon, called Moreton House, also has 19 reception rooms, an impressive ballroom and eight bathrooms.

Set in five acres, it has a wealth of period features and elegantly grand rooms - and is around 35 times the size of the average UK home.

The stamp duty bill from a £7.1million purchase would be enough to buy the mansion - and it has been given an attractive price because it is ‘so big’.

Estate agent James Gibbs said: ‘If it was a tenth of the size it would probably still be the same price so you’re basically getting 90 per cent free.’

Also available for £500,000: Moreton House is a 28-bedroom 'gentleman's residence' near near Bideford, Devon, which was completed in 1821 - 60 years after work commenced

Moreton House: This property boasts a wealth of period features and elegantly proportioned rooms spread over 32,000 sq ft - making it more than 30 times the size of a typical British new build

Work on the
 mansion is thought to have been started in 1760 and it was completed in
 1821. George Buck, the High Sheriff of Devon, lived in the home.

Canning
 Place Mews has its own caretaker present between 8am and 12pm each day.
 To the rear of the garage are a number of cupboards and it also has a 
mezzanine for storage.

It
 is the latest lock-up to be offered with a whopping price-tag in the 
capital.  But while a number of these attract an inflated price because 
of the potential to be developed, this will remain a garage.

It is being offered leasehold and only has 92 years left on its lease - with any buyer expected to pay a further £300 per year in ground rent and maintenance charges.

The garage has been put up for sale with South Kensington estate agent John D Wood. But it is not the most expensive one of its kind.

A new record was set in April for the most expensive garage in Britain, after a 568ft former coach house in Camberwell, south London, was sold for £550,000 - triple the asking price.

Interior: For the same price as the garage, you could get this country mansion in Devon, a picturesque cottage in the Cotswolds or an equestrian centre in Scotland

Near to the royals: The garage is located a 10-minute walk from Kensington Palace in Central London where the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge live

Marina Collett, associate director of John D Wood & Co, in South Kensington, said the garage got its jaw-dropping price because it is located in ‘one of the most desirable neighbourhoods in the world’.

She added: ‘This substantial and secure garage is discretely located just to the west of Palace Gate in Kensington, one of the most desirable neighbourhoods in the world and a very different market to the rest of the country.

'While it is out of the reach for most of us mere mortals, I am sure someone will see it as a reasonable price'

Henry Pryor, property expert

‘Purely its location alone, moments from Kensington Gardens and Kensington Palace, makes this garage a valuable asset. Canning Place is surrounded by very high value residential properties, the vast majority of which do not have either off-street parking or a garage.’

Canning Place Mews has an average house value of £1.7million, which is much less than the average asking price in its postcode of W8 of £3.9million.

Henry Pryor, a buying agent and property expert, added: ‘While it is out of the reach for most of us mere mortals, I am sure someone will see it as a reasonable price.’

The Kensington garage is not the only London lock-up with a hefty asking price. Many tiny spaces in the capital have sold for a small fortune with buyers keen to take advantage of their investment potential.

In 2010, a dilapidated row of 
storage units in Primrose Hill went on the market with a whopping 
£1.25million asking price. But the new owner could rest assured that 
they would own property in the same trendy area as Kate Moss.

In 2012 a 20ft-long garage
 went on the market for £525,000, but that was because of its pricey 
postcode in Knightsbridge - home to Harrods and some of the world's 
richest people.

In October 2013 a double garage sold in Highgate sold for a cool £251,000. For the money the new owner can enjoy mains electricity in each of the two garages, and there is an option of connecting to water on-site.

In August 2013 a 224 sq ft Highgate lock-up, which had been converted into a studio flat, went on the market for £250,000.

In April, a ramshackle garage next to a South London industrial estate in Camberwell became the most expensive ever to sell in Britain after going under the hammer for £550,000 in a 'frenzied' bidding war.
