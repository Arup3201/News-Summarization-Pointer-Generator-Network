Samuel Eto’s ‘Old man’ dance is the standout addition to this year’s FIFA 15 celebration list that includes a number of new moves inspired by the incidents of last season.

Eto’s famously took to doing the dance last season in response to the jibes from Chelsea boss Jose Mourinho’s about his age. 

His manager at the time was caught on camera suggesting Eto’o was 35 rather than his stated age of 32. The celebration was one of many to be revealed in a tutorial by EA Sports in their video to follow the release of the new FIFA 15 demo.

Fans will also get the chance to re-live Luis Suarez’s kiss of the wrist and Borini’s hand bite. Whilst having the option of assaulting the corner flag in a variety of ways, most notably via the Zlatan Ibrahimovic karate kick.

The release of the video comes after it was announced three days ago that Lionel Messi would be given the highest rating on the game, with his score of 93 one ahead of that of Cristiano Ronaldo.

Suarez and Ibrahimovic will also both be among the top 10 players on the game when it hits stores on the 26th September.
