A Texas wedding photographer is holding a couple's pictures hostage because they have refused to pay a fee they say wasn't in their contract.

Andrew and Neely Moldovan, who married in October, have not yet received their professional images from Andrea Polito, who says they still owe her money for a cover for their photo album.

The couple, who paid Polito $6,000 to capture their wedding, insist their contract included a photo album but never mentioned an extra fee for the cover.

They say they assumed a book would automatically include a cover, NBCDFW reported.

Newlyweds: Andrew and Neely Moldovan, pictured on their wedding day, have not yet received their professionally taken photos because the photographer claims they owe her an extra $150

Incredulous: The couple, who live in Dallas, Texas, say the extra fee is for a cover for their photo album - but the cost was never outlined in their contract with the photographer

The extra fee is $150 - and if they don't pay it, they will be unable to get the book or a CD of their photographs.

'We can pay the $150, but it's the principle,' Neely Moldovan, from Dallas, told the local channel.

'It's not the money to us. It's the principle of the fact we already paid you.'

The contract simply says they will receive a '40 page 8.5x12 Storybook Album with up to 80 images' without mentioning an extra fee for the cover. 

Polito told NBC that she had told the couple about the $150 fee in an early meeting - but they said this did not happen.

'It just didn't make sense,' Andrew Moldovan said. 'An album comes with a cover. It's a component of an album. It's a book.'  

Memories: If the couple do not pay the fee, they cannot get the photo album or CD of the photos

Firm: The photographer, Andrew Polito (pictured), said the extra fee was discussed before the wedding

The photographer also told them that if they fail to pay the fee by February 18, the photos will become archived and it will cost them an extra $250 to access them.

'It's heartbreaking because these are our memories,' Mrs Moldovan added. 'Our wedding was over three months ago.' 

In a statement to NBC, Polito, who is also based in Dallas, said: 'We make the utmost effort to consistently provide the best customer service and highest quality of photography in the industry.'

She said she is now trying to work with the couple to resolve the issue.
