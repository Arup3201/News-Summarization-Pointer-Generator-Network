Bob Hawke reveals the real story behind his clash with cranky Frank Sinatra when Ol' Blue Eyes took aim at female journalists in Australia and sparked a union revolt against his tour.

He eats a tin of black cherries every day 'to ward off arthritis' and uses a vibrating piece of gym equipment to keep fit, 'one of his secrets of eternal youth'.

The former PM, 85, remains a raconteur of the highest order but as for his cooking, Kitchen Cabinet host Annabel Crabb says, he rates a six out of 10.

'I would call him a very credible middle order batsmen in the Prime Minister’s Eleven in the kitchen,' she said.

As cheeky as ever. The former PM is described by host Annabel Crabb as being 'enthusiastic' as ever, telling several funny anecdotes during hours of filming at his luxury Sydney home

'I asked Blanche (Bob's wife) to rate him one to 10 in the kitchen and she said maybe a one. She was definitely playing it down, I give him at least a six, he is not a customary figure in the kitchen, once he turned his mind to it, he pulled it off brilliantly I think, any chef that can conclude a meal by offering you a session of putt putt on the roof of his house gets extra points.'

Age has not wearied him, the former Labor leader as cheeky as ever.

'There’s a couple of moments (during the shoot) he’s just kind of enthusiastic,' Annabel Crabb revealed.

'We were doing a tour of the house and we come across this piece of gym equipment, which essentially is a giant vibrator.

'I noticed it in the games room and the next second he’s on it and he says ‘jump on’ and the next thing I’m riding this enormous vibrator in Bob Hawke’s house, a very weird place to be.

'This is kind of one of his secrets of eternal youth, he jumps on this thing and gets violently jiggled up and down. It’s a legitimate piece of gym equipment,’ she laughed.

'I had no idea that being shaken violently is something that keeps you healthy but apparently it’s good for your circulation.

'He’s just an enthusiast, the way that he and Blanche interact, they’re kind of like a couple of teenagers, the whole experience is hilarious and sort of touching and a little sort of "golly, I hope I’m like that when I’m 85".

'He was also endlessly willing to talk and his recall is unbelievably good, he’s 85 years old yet he’s still as gregarious and still takes as much enjoyment in telling a yarn and his recall of dates and details is still quite spectacular.'

Kitchen Cabinet, as Crabb describes the show, 'invades the home, four cameras, lighting and al' that stuff' where the crew can spend up to eight hours filming and interviewing a politician - usually a current MP but she was happy that Bob Hawke was 'a great privilege'.

He tells the show host that being genuine ultimately wins voters over.

'I wanted to talk to him about his views on politics today,' Crabb said.

'The thing about Hawke is that he is the prime minister that got away with everything, he kind of broke the rule book on things you aren’t and are allowed to do as a political leader. The womanising, the drinking, the weeping, the doldrums that he fell into when he was having a difficult time in his family life.

'His view and it is still very robust today, is that the secret to political success is to love people.

'To have this sort of relationship with the Australian people that means that people are persuaded of your bona fides they’ll overlook or forgive you for any boo-boos you make along the way.'

Hawke was Australia's third-longest serving PM, from 1983 to 1991 before being toppled by treasurer Paul Keating in a party room challenge. 

'I asked him about his advice to Bill Shorten, it’s interesting advice, to not let go of your heritage and to listen to the people and to be genuine in everything that you do,' she added.

He did bristle at one line of questioning.

'You have, and I say this to Hawke during the interview, to be a political leader you do have to be a tiny bit crazy in the brain, you know?' Crabb said.

'They’re not normal people. I don’t say that to be insulting, I think he kind of thought I was being insulting. You have to have a different kind of mental make-up, somebody normal wouldn’t last two days in that sort of job.

'You have to have this incredible combination of attributes, you have to decisive enough and convinced enough of your plans and your vision to be able to get up out of bed every morning and face the world even when people are saying you’re an idiot and you’re running the place into rack and ruin.'

She believes that Gough Whitlam’s death rather than diminish from the episode will, in fact, shine an even more important light on her time with Bob Hawke, as it provides an insight into what makes our former political leaders tick and how politics has changed.

'Whitlam’s political life was extraordinary – the thing that I think is inspirational is that he was a hungry searcher for wisdom all of his life,' Annabel Crabb said.

'He drew from the classics, from the arts, from science and infused his sense of public duty and leadership with all that he absorbed from the world around him.

'I think being a leader that finds inspiration from history and in reading is quite an important thing. If there is one thing that troubles me about modern politics is that its practitioners barely have the time to scratch themselves let alone to find ideas in the world around them.

'Hawkey had a very different approach – he derived energy from the people around him, he’s a great lover of the Australian people.

'He found his inspiration and energy from being among people, whether the shopping centres or sporting events or getting out on the punt. He was hungry for human contact.'

Bob Hawke today paid tribute to Gough Whitlam 'that this is not a time of sadness, he was ready to go and his family was ready for him to go'. 

Mr Hawke also added that Australia is a better country because of the life and work of Gough Whitlam and that he made the ALP relevant and led the party with great imagination.

'He steams me a fish, which was really kind of delicious and made a sauce to go with it. Having decided to cook lunch he threw himself whole-heartedly into it,' Kitchen Cabinet host Annabel Crabb said of Bob Hawke

Crabb continued, recalling that Bob Hawke 'lives to tell stories'.

'We could really have made it a 90 minute episode just with back to back yarns – there is quite a long story about his personal clash with Frank Sinatra which was so fabulous, which we will put up on-line because people shoudn’t miss it,' she added.

'Half an hour is not that long when we’ve got a fish to steam and he’s got this hilarious story about his first ever interaction with Ronald Reagan when he was first Prime Minister.

'The insight he can give to conducting foreign affairs as a new prime minister into the art of being a successful prime minister for such a long period is just invaluable.'

And she finds that the relationship with Paul Keating still simmers.

'There’s such an unbelievable kind of slow motion tango going on between these two men (Hawke and Keating),' she said.

'So extraordinary, one of the most fascinating things of looking at politics is that these giants enmesh and disentangle from each other and then they can’t quite ever let go of each other.

'Every year or two there’s a public conflagration between them, they share their mixed recollections of whose idea it was to float the dollar, whose idea it was to reform the economy who was more committed to making these changes and who did more to bring them about.

'Will we ever get to the end of the Keating-Hawke wars? I suspect not.'
