More than 100,000 mothers would return to work under Labour's plan to cut child care costs, the party has claimed.

Shadow children's minister Lucy Powell said Ed Miliband's proposal to extend free childcare would allow squeezed families to take on more hours.

Under Labour's proposals working parents with three or four-year-olds will get an extra 10 hours of free childcare a week.

Childcare costs are soaring - leaving many parents unable to return to work, even if they want to

This will help ease crippling childcare costs for half a million youngsters, Miss Powell said.

Labour will also give parents new legal rights to get early evening childcare at their primary school.

Miss Powell said the proposals would allow 135,000 mothers go back to work or take on extra hours.

She pointed to international figures showing that Britain lagged behind much of Europe in helping mothers go back to work.

Seven out of 10 mothers now have paid jobs in the UK - but this is considerably below top performers Denmark, Sweden and the Netherlands where 80 per cent are in work.

Miss Powell claims that if affordable childcare was available the gap between the UK and the top performers could be closed.

This would mean the number of mothers in work or taking on more hours would increase by 135,000, she said.

She said: 'Childcare is a big part of David Cameron's cost-of-living crisis.

'Families have been hit hard by the soaring cost of childcare which is up 30 per cent since 2010 – five times faster than wages.

'At the same time, there are fewer childcare places available and families have seen the support they relied on to help make childcare affordable has been reduced.

'Hardworking families will be better off with Labour. 

'We understand that increased help with childcare is good for the economy and for families. 

'Our plans to extend free childcare from 15 to 25 hours for working parents with three and four-year-olds will make a real difference and help thousands of mums shut out of the labour market or prevented from working the hours they want by high childcare costs.

'Worth £1,500 per child and paid for by an increase in the bank levy, Labour's plans will help tackle the cost of living crisis and make work pay.'

Families have seen childcare costs rocket 30 per cent since 2010. Labour say over the same period real wages have fallen by £1,600.

Women earn most before they turn 40, according to the Office for National Statistics.

Their pay peaks in the 30-39 age group at £533-a-week or £27,726-a-year.

However, men continue to see another 10 years of wage rises, peaking in the 40-49 age group at £638-a-week or £33,176.
