On her own: Lady Hale, the deputy president of the Supreme Court, said she was disappointed that since she was made a Law Lord in 2004, no other woman has followed in her footsteps

Women are not being appointed as top judges in Britain because the selection process is ‘dominated’ by men, the country’s most senior woman judge has suggested.

Lady Hale, the deputy president of the Supreme Court, said she was disappointed that since she was made a Law Lord in 2004, no other woman has followed in her footsteps.

Men might be more likely to pick other men because it was easier to see merit in ‘people who are like you’, she said.

Since her appointment, 13 lawyers have been elevated to sit in the country’s highest appeal court as a judge, first in the House of Lords and from 2009 in the Supreme Court.

Lady Hale, a former High Court and Court of Appeal judge, said: ‘Most of you will also know that while I am flattered and proud to have been the first woman appointed as a Law Lord in 2004 I do not want to be the last.’

Of all the 20 or so senior politicians and judges who have to be consulted on appointments to the Supreme Court, she is the only woman.

And the five-person selection committee which made three appointments - all men - to the court earlier this year, only one was a woman.

Lady Hale said: ‘I think of the people who have to be consulted, I am the only woman.

‘I do not know whether the fact that the appointments process is dominated by men has anything to do with the choice of people.

‘It would not be impossible to speculate that it is always much easier to perceive merit in people who are like you than it is to discern the merit of those who are a bit different.’

She added: ‘I am disappointed that in the 10 years since I was appointed not one among the 13 subsequent appointments to this court has been a woman.

‘Now, things are improving in the lower ranks of the judiciary, but regrettably not here.’

However, she rejected the idea of positive discrimination.

Lady Hale also said judges and barristers should ditch the wigs they wear in court.

‘My main objection is that they are men’s wigs. Of course, that is one of the reasons why the early women barristers wanted to wear wigs.

'It was because they wanted to look like everybody else. But we have got beyond that.’
