A brother and sister who cheated the taxman out of £350,000 and blew the cash on a luxury Caribbean holiday have each been jailed for 18 months.

Matthew, 29, and Rebecca Kania, 31, from Brentwood, Essex, used the money they swindled during the five-year scam on a lavish break in Barbados while wining and dining clients at top restaurants.

They were directors of Embassy Scaffolding Services but set up ‘buffer companies’, enabling them to take staff off the payroll and pocket income tax and national insurance contributions.

Between September 2008 and June 2013, the Kania’s stole the huge sum from 25 employees who thought they were paying their taxes to HMRC.

The pair set Turbo Labour Services, Foremost Labour Services, Evolution Contract Services or Lost PR, but never filed any tax returns.

The Kania siblings became directors of the scaffolding compnay after their father, who previously owned it, was forced into bankruptcy.

Judge Nicholas Huskinson, sentencing at Snaresbrook Crown Court, told the pair: ‘There was a private company which was a family company and that company was eventually run by you with you effectively being the two owners of any shares.

‘Rather than the company declaring to HMRC for its full workforce of some thirty people and all its deductions for its employees, it transferred the employees to buffer companies.

‘In other words a company set up for the purpose of this manoeuvre.

‘Although
 you were not directors of these companies you did control them and the 
idea was that the employees, rather than being employed by Embassy, 
instead were employed by the buffer company.

‘They
 would issue the payslips and deduct from the employee’s pay-packet the 
necessary taxes but rather than account that to HMRC it would be 
returned to Embassy.

‘You carried on the fraud once you became aware of it - it coincided with the recession in the building industry and some separate misfortune of lorries owned by the company being stolen.

‘I have thought very hard about whether this can be suspended but in my judgement this was a serious fraud carried out over a long time and a large amount of money was taken.

...‘I would be failing in my public duty if I did not send you immediately to custody'

‘I would be failing in my public duty if I did not send you immediately to custody.’

Relatives of the family were horrified to see the pair, who had been embracing throughout the hearing, be sentenced to prison.

Rebecca Kania sobbed as she was led to the cells while her brother said tearfully: ‘I love you mum.’

Christopher Gillespie, defending the Kanias, said: ‘It is accepted that some of the money went on high living but mainly for the benefit of Matthew rather than Rebecca.

‘I would submit their lifestyle was improved rather than lavish.

‘A large sum of money was used to entertain clients to keep business not because of any selfish reason to spend it at expensive places.

‘In fact when their homes were raided the bank statements seized had been annotated by Rebecca so she knew what the money had been spent on.’

The court heard Matthew is blind in one eye and has apparently been diagnosed with adult ADHD.

The pair pleaded guilty to cheating public revenue.
