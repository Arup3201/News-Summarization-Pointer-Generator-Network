A 61-year-old St. Louis County man has been sentenced to 30 years in prison after pleading guilty to beating his wife to death with a laptop and then trying to make it look like an accident.

William Lynn Gunter, of Town and Country, pleaded guilty Monday to second-degree murder in the March 2013 death of 55-year-old Suzanne Ball Gunter. The couple had been married three decades and had two grown daughters.

Gunter, a vice president of a private insurance company, initially lied to police that he found his wife unconscious from a fall down the stairway in their $440,000 home.

County prosecutors said Gunter was cheating on his wife and having financial problems when he repeatedly struck Suzanne on the head.

Assistant prosecutor Ed Magee told St Louis Post-Dispatch that Suzanne Gunter had more than $1million in savings and life insurance benefits, but she was in control of all the assets and not her husband. 

A police officer who responded to the Gunters' home at 1515 Mason Hill Court at around 3pm on March 18, 2013, found the husband sitting on the floor near the front door and sobbing uncontrollably while cradling his unconscious wife's bashed head in his lap. Both spouses were covered in blood.

Mrs Gunter was rushed to a local hospital, where she was pronounced dead from severe head trauma. An autopsy later showed that she suffered nine gashes on her head and a broken wrist. 

When interviewed by police, Mr Gunter said that he had been in the living room when he heard his wife upstairs yelling at their dog, followed by the sound of a loud thump. 

But Mrs Gunter’s injuries were inconsistent with his story, and her husband was initially charged with first-degree murder.

According to investigators, the 61-year-old man struck his wife in the head with a laptop and then called neighbors over to his house for help, telling them that Mrs Gunter had an accident. 

Local residents said William Gunter appeared devastated. He seemed too upset to ride in the ambulance with his wife, so one of the neighbors gave him a ride to Mercy Hospital, where the victim was pronounced dead a short time later.

The couple's two grown daughters were not home at the time of the tragic incident, police said.  

According to his LinkedIn page, William Gunter was a vice president of AHM Financial Group, a St Louis firm specializing in insurance, investment and asset management. 

Gunter’s attorney said Monday the 61-year-old father of two will be eligible for parole in about 11 years.

The lawyer explained that his client has opted to take the plea deal to spare their daughters from testifying at a trial.

His slain wife graduated in 1980 from Indiana University with a degree in communications and marketing. On her Facebook page, the youthful-looking mother of two listed her previous occupation as a client delivery manager for Xerox.

Mrs Gunter volunteered with the Parkways School District and the City of Town and Country, working for the community relations commission. 

The victim’s family told the paper they were satisfied with the outcome of the case.

‘We are relieved it’s been solved and he’s going to prison to pay for all that he’s done,’ said Suzanne’s older sister, Kathy Ball Laesch.

Town and Country is a wealthy suburb of St Louis with the highest median household income of any city in Missouri with population over 10,000, and one of the highest nationwide.
