Two PCSOs sniffed out a 
massive £500,000 cannabis factory - before spending a staggering seven hours trying to 
find the suspected 'grower' in the crop.

Kirsty Hume and Rachel Kendell uncovered the two-storey warehouse in Leeds, West Yorkshire, on Wednesday afternoon after noticing a strong smell of cannabis.

They discovered 1,000 illegal plants - with a street value of more than half a million pounds.

However, it wasn't until Wednesday night that they stumbled across the 46-year-old male 'grower' - who had been hiding in a wall cavity. 

Ms Hume and Ms Kendell, who have had no formal drugs training, were forced to break into the factory, off Bath Road, during the raid.

They were shortly joined by the police, who started to dismantle the factory, before discovering the suspect - believed to be from Vietnam - hiding in the small space.

Today, Inspector Andy Berriman, from Leeds City Neighbourhood Policing Team, said the man is believed to be one of four people responsible for running the cannabis farm.

Dismantled: The 46-year-old 'grower' - believed to be from Vietnam - was found by police hiding in a wall cavity

'Officers were clearing out and taking sheeting off the wall and he was there in a tiny cavity,' he said.

'We are thinking that there may be three others and it’s possible they’re all victims who have been trafficked into the country and forced to work there.'

The five-bedroom warehouse - which included basic living quarters, such as a bed and cooking facilities - contained sophisticated lighting, ventilation and heating system.

It also included a rota of tasks, written in a foreign language - while the plants were found to be at various stages of growth.

Police Constable Pat Kenning, who has worked as part of a drugs team for more than a decade, said the factory was 'one of the most professional operations' he had ever seen.

'Someone has taken care here which makes you think they intended to stay for a while,' he said.

'They aren’t amateurs, they will probably have a number of grows ongoing at the same time.'

He added that the suspected 'grower' and his accomplices are likely to have been forced into running the farm after being 
trafficked into the UK by organised crime gangs.

'It is likely that we’ve got someone in here - probably imported into the country - who is practically kept as a slave to look after this place,' he said.

'There is an organised crime gang behind it. The people who tend to these sorts of farms are, in effect, victims themselves.'

A job well done: Following the PCSOs' discovery, hundreds of people have taken to social-networking sites to congratulate them. James Clennett wrote: 'Well done to those two! Keep that rubbish off the streets!'

Meanwhile,West Yorkshire Police and Crime Commissioner Mark Burns-Williamson said the scale of the problem was difficult to assess. 

But he added: 'There’s no doubt in my view that it’s an underestimated crime and something that needs putting at the top of the agenda.'

Forensic investigators are now studying the factory and its produce in a bid to track down the people responsible.

Following the PCSOs' discovery, hundreds of people have taken to social-networking sites, such as Twitter and Facebook, to congratulate the pair.

James Clennett wrote on Facebook: 'Well done to those two! Keep that rubbish off the streets!'

Meanwhile, Matthew
 Watson said: 'Well done the police. A joint operation between the PCSOs
 and narcotics division done well. Now they just need to smoke out the 
perpetrators.'

However, Guy Leadbeater spoke out against the successful operation - saying: 'That’s all the police are interested in - weed growers and motorists.'

And Laura
Brewer wrote: 'Spoil Sports! How about go and hunt the criminals that 
sell heroin to kids? Vile humans who pilfer from people’s home? Car 
thieves. Need I go on?'

Over the past two years, more than 340 cannabis farms have been discovered in Leeds.

Bryan Dent, West Yorkshire Police’s drugs co-ordinator, said fewer were being run by gangs from Vietnam and the Far East than in the past - adding: 'The profile has changed to indigenous crime groups.'

Sorry we are unable to accept comments for legal reasons.
