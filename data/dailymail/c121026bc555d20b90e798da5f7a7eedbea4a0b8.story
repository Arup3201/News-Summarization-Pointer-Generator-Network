He was airlifted from his rural village in the south of the country to the hospital for a series of tests.

Doctors found the former president and hero of the anti-apartheid struggle had a recurrent lung infection and had developed gallstones.

He underwent surgery to remove the gallstones on December 15 and is still in hospital.

Officials have said Mr Mandela is improving and is responding to treatment.

South African president Jacob Zuma said the whole country is behind Mr Mandela and he urged people to keep the former president in their thoughts on Christmas Day and throughout the festive season.

Mr Zuma describes Mr Mandela, who was imprisoned under apartheid for 27 years, as an 'ardent fighter'.
