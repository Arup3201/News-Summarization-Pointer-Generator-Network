As the debt ceiling deadline draws 
dangerously close, Barack Obama was spotted heading to church with his 
family in Washington this morning.

Perhaps
he was praying for a solution - or better a resolution - to the small 
task of securing a multi-trillion-dollar deal that House Democrats and 
Republicans can agree on before the Government defaults on August 2.

If the President was feeling the strain of last week's gruelling debt meetings, he didn't show it. Looking resplendent in their Sunday Best the Obamas laughed and joked with each other as they made their way back to the White House after the service at St John's Church.

Mr Obama also told reporters he would 'absolutely' be watching the women's soccer world cup final between USA and Japan today.

While the First family gathered around the television White House and congressional aides were continuing discussions to find a solution for increasing the nation's borrowing authority while reducing long-term deficits, behind the scenes.

This
comes after the failure to get a deal after five straight days of 
meetings last week between Mr Obama and congressional leaders at the 
White House.

But there was hope today that congressional leaders still had time 'to get something big done' with Mr Obama.

'I
think that what is encouraging is that the leaders in Congress seem to 
have all agreed that we can't push to a default,' White House budget 
director Jack Lew said.

'So I think that there are many conversations going on in order to make sure that doesn't happen.'

The
government will exceed the current $14.3trillion debt ceiling in 16 
days, after which it will be in default of its obligations. The 
consequences could be far-reaching, with potentially higher interest 
rates on mortgages and car loans, a halt in Social Security checks and 
unsettled world financial markets.

Talks have continued over the weekend and White House spokesman Dan Pfeiffer 
said on Twitter that Mr Obama, Vice President Joe Biden and other White 
House officials were discussing 'various options' with lawmakers 
throughout the day yesterday.

Meanwhile Republican House Speaker John Boehner is 'keeping the lines of 
communication open,' his spokesman, Mike Steel told Bloomberg. 'Meetings have been
occurring.'

Republicans have rejected any plan that contains tax increases.

Lew said on NBC's Meet The Press that the president 'made clear he wants the largest deal possible.'

'He wants to do the most we can to 
reduce the deficit,' Lew said. 'But he also said that if we can't get 
the most done, then in addition to extending the debt we should do as 
much as we can.'

House Republicans are preparing to 
vote this week on allowing an increase in the government's borrowing 
limit through 2012 as long as Congress approves a balanced-budget 
constitutional amendment.

Sen. Jim DeMint, R-S.C., called that 
proof Republicans are willing to compromise and 'hardly a radical idea' 
but the Senate's No 2 Democrat, Dick Durbin of Illinois, said that bill 
doesn't have the needed support in the Senate.

'This notion that we have to change the Constitution to do what we were elected to do is just plain wrong,' Durbin said.

Lew also did not like the idea.

'What these ideas do is say let's 
kick the can down the road so that others will deal with it,' he said. 
'The challenge is for Washington now to do the job the American people 
sent us here to do.'

DeMint said the U.S. is on course for
a financial disaster and that lawmakers have 'to draw a line in the 
sand now because a day of reckoning is going to come.'

'And the longer we put it off the bigger the problems are going to be for our country,' DeMint said.

Holding the fort: Meanwhile White House Budget Director Jack Lew revealed there were 'many conversations' going on as the battle to secure a deal before August 2 carried on

However, if it comes down to it, 
White House officials who say Congress won't let the U.S. default are 
'probably right on that,' DeMint said.

Senators are working on a bipartisan 
plan that would allow Mr Obama to raise the debt limit without a prior 
vote by lawmakers. The talks focused on how to address long-term deficit
reduction in the proposal in hopes of satisfying House Republicans.

'Lines of communication remain open with all parties,' said Brendan Buck, a spokesman for House Speaker John Boehner.

Mr Obama admitted that 
compromise was needed in talks with Republicans to solve the
crisis, during his weekly radio and internet address yesterday.

He said it would take 'shared sacrifice' for
Democrats and Republicans to come to an agreement.

'Let's be honest. Neither party in this town is blameless,' he said in 
his broadcast to the nation. 'Both have talked this problem to death without 
doing enough about it. That's what drives people nuts about Washington.'

He attempted to reach out to the middle class in the address, repeating his 
call for higher taxes on the wealthy and reforms to politically popular 
entitlement programs such as Social Security and Medicare. 'We are all 
part of the same country. We are all in this together,' he said.

But Republicans renewed their call for an amendment to require a balanced budget.

'The only reason this administration doesn't want a constitutional 
amendment is because they want to keep spending the American people's 
money,' Senator Orrin Hatch said in the Republican response.

'And the only 
reason congressional Democrats would refuse to pass it, is because they 
know the people of this country would rise up and quickly ratify it.'

In his weekly broadcast Mr Obama continued to insist that it was necessary to remove some tax breaks.

'Simply
put, it will take a balanced approach, shared sacrifice, and a 
willingness to make unpopular choices on all our parts,' he said.

'That
means spending less on domestic programmes,' the President said. 'It 
means spending less on defence programmes. ... And it means taking on 
the tax code, and cutting out certain tax breaks and deductions for the 
wealthiest Americans.'

'The truth is, you can't solve our deficit without cutting spending,' Mr Obama said.

'But
you also can't solve it without asking the wealthiest Americans to pay 
their fair share - or without taking on loopholes that give special 
interests and big corporations tax breaks that middle-class Americans 
don't get.'
