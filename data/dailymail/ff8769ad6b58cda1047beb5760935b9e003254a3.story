Olympic champion Ian Thorpe has bared his soul in an interview with British journalist Michael Parkinson.

Thorpe, who will be part of Network Ten's Commonwealth Games commentary team this month, recently sat down with Parkinson to discuss his career, family and personal life.

Australia's most decorated Olympian has just overcome a physical and mental battle following complications arising from shoulder surgery that almost cost him his arm.

'Are you gay?' No question was off-limits for British journalist Michael Parkinson when he sat down with former Olympic swimmer Ian Thorpe for an interview that went to air Sunday night.

Parkinson said Thorpe's decision that no question was off limits was brave and says he examines the good times and the bad of the Australian swimming legend.

'His fight against depression offers a unique insight into the darker side of celebrity and success,' Parkinson said in a statement released by Ten.

'What fascinates me most about Ian is that apart from the very beginning of his career, he never seemed to enjoy and celebrate his success.

'Ian Thorpe has always been near the top of my list to interview.

'Not many athletes can claim to be the best of all time. Ian can.'

Parkinson is renowned for not being afraid to ask the tough and sometimes uncomfortable questions.

Some of the British journalist's most memorable moments includes the time that boxer Muhammad Ali squared up to him for calling him Cassius Clay instead of by his Muslim name, and when former Spice Girl Victoria Beckham let slip her nickname for husband David was Golden Balls.

Former British Primer Minister Tony Blair also spoke about the time that his father-in-law had asked permission to smoke cannabis in front of him, while his chat with Hollywood A-lister Meg Ryan made for uncomfortable viewing when she appeared moody and unresponsive and asked for the interview to be wrapped up.

Known as the the Thorpedo during his stellar career, Thorpe smashed 22 world records and along the way won five gold, three silver and one bronze Olympic medals.

He has also won 11 World titles and 11 (10 gold, one silver) Commonwealth Games medals.

Thorpe first retired in November, 2006, aged 24, and then made an ill-fated comeback in 2011 when he failed to make the Australian team for the 2012 London Games.

Ten has announced it will air the TV special, Ian Thorpe: The Parkinson Interview, on Sunday, July 13, at 6.30pm.
