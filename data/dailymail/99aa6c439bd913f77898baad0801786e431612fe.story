A teaching assistant has escaped jail after sending lewd texts and naked photos of herself to a 14-year-old pupil.

Shelley Trinder, 30, sent hundreds of sexually explicit messages to the male student at a school where she worked in Telford, Shropshire, a court heard. 

She also sent him a series of naked photos - including an image of herself using a sex toy.

Spared jail: Shelley Trinder, 30, sent hundreds of sexually explicit messages to a teenage pupil, Shrewsbury Crown Court (pictured) heard. She has been handed a 20-month jail sentence, suspended for two years

The mother of two admitted one charge of causing or inciting a child to engage in sexual activity at Shrewsbury Crown Court on Friday.

However, she has now been spared jail after a judge handed her a 20-month sentence, suspended for two years.

Trinder began sending Facebook messages to children at the school in 2011, before singling out the teenage boy, the court heard.

She then gave the pupil her Blackberry pin number and sent him a topless photo of herself - with only her arms covering her breasts.

She later messaged the boy a nude image of the lower half of her body, before sending him a photo of herself using a sex toy.

Trinder also sent the student lewd texts every day - saying she was 'horny' and describing what sexual acts she wanted to do to him, the court heard.

Raj Punia, prosecuting, said the school had spoken to Trinder about her behaviour in July 2011 after discovering she was chatting to pupils on Facebook. 

'She was warned she would be putting her job at risk if she continued,' she said.

'In November it was brought to the attention of the authorities that there were inappropriate activities going on.

'She gave him (teenage boy) the pin number for her Blackberry phone so he could text her for free.

'He
 sent her a message saying "hi" and instead of ignoring the message or 
telling him it was inappropriate to text her, she encouraged this 
contact. 

'One night in August 2011 she sent him a message saying she was out drinking and said she was "horny".'

Sentencing Trinder, Judge Robin Onions described her as 'totally unsuited' to a career in teaching.

'The school appears to have acted completely properly and warned her and she just ignored the warnings,' he said.

Dismissed: Telford and Wrekin Council (pictured), which employed Trinder, said she was fired in March 2012

'He was a remarkably vulnerable pupil and she was clearly sexually attracted to him.

'In many ways this is a classic grooming case, but they did meet and didnâ€™t have sexual contact.

'If there had been any contact, she would have gone into custody and it would have been measured in years.

'This young lady is remarkably immature and totally unsuited to a career in teaching. If she does anything like this again it will be prison.'

Trinder has been banned from working with children for life and placed under a sexual offences prevention order for seven years.

She has also been handed a two-year supervision order with 10-year notification requirements and a three-month curfew.

Speaking after the case, Nigel Newman, a spokesman for Telford and Wrekin Council which employed Trinder, said the teaching assistant was fired in March last year.

He said: 'The individual was suspended from her employment with the council as a support assistant in February 2012 as soon as we were made aware of the allegation arising from the incident which led to her being charged by police. 

'Following this, disciplinary proceedings were held which resulted in her dismissal from her job with the council in March 2013.'
