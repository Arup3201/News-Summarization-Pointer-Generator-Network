Filled with stylish costumes, decadent lifestyles and sordid affairs, Mad Men has kept viewers gripped for an impressive seven series.

But the Mad Men craze has also seen iconic Sixities products such as lava lamps, drinks trolleys and whisky tumblers make a revival, according to research.

The hit series, about a New York advertising agency, has prompted a retro revival in online shopping habits, with people rushing to buy not only the furniture in the show, but beauty products to transform themselves into the perfect pin up.

Xavier Garambois, the vice president of EU retail at Amazon said: 'We regularly see TV shows influencing what people buy and Mad Men has taken this to a new level with the show influencing homeware as well as fashion and beauty. 

'We can't go back in time but Sixties Americana is well and truly swinging in a British living room near you.'

Dave Brittain, from the Amazon.co.uk Home Store, added: 'The Mad Men-inspired Sixties renaissance has seen the UK adopting a bold, glamorous look for the home, replacing the neutral, minimalist style that has been popular recently

'The bestselling products demonstrate how influential the series has been, bringing back retro drinks trolleys, decanters and even the oft-maligned lava lamp.'
