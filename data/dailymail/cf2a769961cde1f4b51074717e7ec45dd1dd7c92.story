David Cameron will today tell businesses enjoying their best conditions 'for a long time' that 'it's time Britain had a pay rise'.

He will also propose a minimum wage above £8 an hour by the end of the next Parliament.

Firms' costs are falling thanks to the strongest economic growth for seven years and the lowest inflation for more than a decade, the Prime Minister will say.

His optimistic words echo the famous July 1957 speech by then Tory premier Harold 'Supermac' Macmillan that, at a time of low unemployment and high growth, most Britons 'have never had it so good'.

David Cameron will today tell businesses enjoying their best conditions 'for a long time' that 'it's time Britain had a pay rise'

Mr Cameron, following a week of controversy over Labour's 'anti-business' rhetoric, will suggest the best answer business leaders can give to critics is to boost the pay and conditions of staff.

Pay has finally started to outstrip inflation, but firms should go further and 'pass on the good economic news', he is expected to tell captains of industry at the British Chambers of Commerce conference.

Tory strategists hope an increasing economic feelgood factor, buoyed by jobs growth and low inflation putting more money in people's pockets, will translate into stronger wage increases by May's general election.

Companies are thought to be sitting on £166billion in cash reserves after battening down the hatches through the recession. Profitability is at its highest level since 1998.

Mr Cameron will say: 'Now that our long-term economic plan is truly working, together we've got to make sure it works for everyone in our country. Economic success can't just be shown in the GDP figures or on the balance sheets of British businesses, but in people's pay packets and bank accounts and lifestyles.

'The most recent figures show that wages are already growing faster than inflation, and as the economy continues to grow it's important this continues and that everyone benefits. Put simply – it's time Britain had a pay rise.'

Mr Cameron will say the recovery overseen by the coalition has been marked by 'astounding job creation', and add: 'To make sure more of those workers feel the effects of this recovery, this Government has already delivered the first real-terms increase in the minimum wage since the crisis.

'I want that to go further – indeed we are on a trajectory to over £8 an hour by 2020. As for business – the conditions have not been this good for a long time. We've got the strongest growth for seven years. We are seeing falling oil prices, meaning businesses up and down the country have lower prices on their inputs. Inflation is at half a per cent.

'Now that your costs are falling and it's cheaper to do business, I'm confident that more businesses will pass on that good economic news to their workers, in rising pay cheques and higher earnings.'

Labour's business spokesman Chuka Umunna will attempt to draw a line under his party's row with business leaders, telling the conference that 'we will work every day' to make it easier for them to succeed. 

Shadow chancellor Ed Balls will claim Conservative plans for a referendum on EU membership risk damaging business, saying that 'to walk away from Europe – our biggest trading market – would be a disaster for Britain'.

John Longworth, director general of the British Chambers of Commerce, will say that a reluctance to lend to small businesses remains a 'chronic handicap' to the economy.

Funding for small businesses continues to disappoint more than four years after the Mail launched its Make the Banks Lend campaign.

London Mayor Boris Johnson yesterday launched a strong attack on Labour leader Ed Miliband and Mr Balls, saying 'everything they say or do seems redolent of a distaste for wealth creation'.

The Conservatives have moved three points ahead of Labour, according to the latest weekly survey commissioned by Lord Ashcroft. It puts the Tories up three points in a week on 34 per cent, to Labour's unchanged 31 per cent.
