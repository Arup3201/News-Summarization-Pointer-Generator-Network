A primary school teacher who tried to have sex with a 10 year old student and had his name tattooed on her chest in an infinity symbol has escaped jail time.

Diane Brimble, 47, appeared at the County Court of Victoria on Thursday and was handed a two year correction order.

Judge Mark Taft sentenced Brimble to 200 hours of community service and ordered her to be placed on the sex offender register for eight years.

The mother of eight was convicted by a jury in August of a single charge of committing an indecent act which involved hugging and kissing the boy while asking him to have sex in 2013. 

Diane Brimble was sentenced to 200 hours of community service after she was convicted of a single charge of committing an indecent act on 

She was acquitted of five other charges and will never teach again.

In handing down his judgement, the Judge Taft said he was at a complete loss to understand why Brimble would carry out such conduct but noted she was unlikely to reoffend.

Judge Taft also made reference to a letter Brimble wrote to her victim in which she said 'I love you more than you ever know' and 'there will never be anyone else in my heart'.

The full note read: 'I miss you more than words can say. I can't write how much I miss you because there just aren't enough words.

'I love you more than you will ever know. There will never be anyone else in my heart. Though you will be so far away when I leave I will still see you every night in my dreams just as I do now.

'Infinite love, forever in my heart. Always and forever.'

Judge Taft said: 'It beggars belief that a mature teacher should write such a letter to her student.'

The mother of eight, 47, grabbed the 10-year-old victim while he was in her home and asked him to sleep with her

She was acquitted of five other charges and will never teach again 

'I reject suggestion that inexperience as a new teacher and naivety explain your behaviour,' he told the court.

Judge Taft also said: 'You breached the trust reposed in you by (the boy's) parents who properly expected that a classroom teacher would care for their son in a professional manner.'

'Your offending occurred in a context of obsessive and entirely misdirected affection for (the boy) which you described as "love".' 

The court heard the offence occurred in 2013 when Brimble was the child's teacher and lived next door to the 10 year old's family.

The boy had been at a friends house with Brimble's own family when she drove him and her children back to her home.

'In the hallway, you grabbed (the boy), hugged him, asked him if he would sleep with you that night and have sex,' Judge Taft told the court.

'(The boy) asked you why he would sleep with you and you told him that you loved him. He pushed your hands away and you kissed him on the cheek.

I miss you more than words can say. I can't write how much I miss you because there just aren't enough words.

I love you more than you will ever know. There will never be anyone else in my heart. Though you will be so far away when I leave I will still see you every night in my dreams just as I do now.

Infinite love, forever in my heart. Always and forever. 

'He told you that he was not old enough to have sex and you said 'You are when you're at my house'.

The boy's mother had earlier told the court Brimble turned her son into a 'sexual commodity'.

She had lured the boy to her rose-covered home in Hamilton in country Victoria for sex, the court heard.

Just two years after graduating from university to take her 'dream come true' job teaching primary schoolkids, 47-year-old Brimble was exposing her breasts to the boy, asking him for sex and showing him condoms and sex toys.

She had a framed photo of the boy on her bedside table and designed a tattoo with the words 'love for' and his name in an infinity symbol.

The boy's mother told the court they had to move from their community and the boy was placed on antipsychotic medication.

She said it also impacted on his siblings.

'They drew pictures of rainbows and unicorns. He drew black pictures of knives and death,' she said, reading her victim impact statement to the court.

The father said the boy would not look at his parents as he believed Brimble had cast a spell on him, so she could see and hear everything he did.

The father's victim impact statement was read to the court by prosecutor Patrick Bourke, who said Brimble tried to tour the boy's new school and enrol her children there.

He said his son, who has Asperger's syndrome, said Brimble was 'on him'.

'She tried to manipulate [him] to make him think she loved him and his parents did not,' the statement read out by prosecutor Patrick Bourke said.

'I feel sick every time I think of my son's name tattooed on her body.'

Brimble faced court in August charged with five counts of committing an indecent act with a child aged under 16 years, and one charge of using a telecommunications device to groom a child. She pleaded not guilty to all six charges.

Brimble was convicted by a jury in August of a single charge of committing an indecent act which involved hugging and kissing the boy while asking him to have sex in 2013

The boy Brimble approached  had to be placed on antipsychotic medication after the event in November 2013

A jury took two days to find her not guilty of the child grooming charge and four other charges, but convicted her of committing an indecent act which involved hugging and kissing the boy while asking him to have sex.  

Before she fell in love with the 10-year-old boy, tattooed his name on her chest and made him believe she had cast a spell on him, Brimble had once been described as a selfless 'supermum'.

During the trial at Warrnambool County Court – just minutes from the university campus where she had so proudly graduated in 2011 – Brimble was described as exhibiting 'bizarre' conduct and a baffling 'psycho sexual profile'. 

Barrister Jennifer Clark, on behalf of Brimble, said her client had developed an affection beyond the normal teacher/student relationship, 'but she has not overstepped into criminal conduct'.

Ms Clark said Brimble had endured a difficult life and an abusive marriage which she had fought hard to overcome by becoming a teacher.

The boy's parents labelled Brimble an 'evil woman' and feel 'disgusted'
