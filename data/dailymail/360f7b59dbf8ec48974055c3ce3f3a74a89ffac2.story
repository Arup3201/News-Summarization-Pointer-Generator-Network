Dom Mintoff, Malta's former socialist prime minister and dominant political force for more than half a century, has died. He was 96.

Mintoff passed away at his residence near Valletta on Monday, the government said.

Known for his confrontational style and fiery speeches, he oversaw the closure of Britain's military base on the island in 1979 - ending the 200-year-old military link.

Joseph Muscat, the current leader of the labour party, said that all the Maltese have been orphaned by Mintoff's death.

Mintoff was prime minister between 1956 and 1958 and between 1971 and 1984, when he handed over the reins to his picked successor Karmenu Mifsud Bonnici.

He was a member of parliament for more than 50 years and held sway over Malta's political scene before and after its independence from Britain.

Born in Cospicua on August 6, 1916, he was the son of British Royal Navy cook went on to marry a Briton.

But politically, he looked east and at one stage formed strong bonds with Communist China.

Mintoff was also close to former Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi and promoted a policy of non-alignment and neutrality from the superpowers, often drawing the wrath of the West.

The former labour party chief remained a powerful influence after his retirement and brought down a labour government in 1998 after a falling out with then leader Alfred Sant.

He also fiercely but unsuccessfully fought Malta's accession to the European Union in 2004.

Labour leader Mr Muscat last night paid tribute to Mintoff for bringing in a raft of social reforms including pensions, the minimum wage, free schooling and medical service and a children's allowance.

Another central achievement, he said, was enforcing the separation of church and state.

Mintoff, who studied at Oxford University, remained a MP until well into his 80s.

1978: Mintoff's daughter Yana, then 26, and John Mcsherry appear outside court after being charged with causing criminal damage. In a protest against the British military presence in Northern Ireland, they hurled three bags of horse manure into the House Of Commons chamber from the Strangers' Gallery during a debate

His death also reminded British MPs of one of the most bizarre breaches of House of Commons security in living memory.

His daughter, Yana, as active and confrontational a politician as her father, visited Parliament on July 6, 1978.

And as a protest against the British 
military presence in Northern Ireland, she hurled three bags of horse 
manure into the chamber from the Strangersâ€™ Gallery. It happened during a
debate on Scottish devolution.

Miss Mintoff and a male accomplice, were dragged from the chamber and later fined.

She had apparently strapped the bags 
of manure round her body - even so it is a mystery how this was not 
spotted, or even sniffed out, by security officials at the entrance.
