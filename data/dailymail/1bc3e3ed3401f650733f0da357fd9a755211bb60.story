Andy Murray’s French Open hopes were left hanging by a worn racket string when he finished an extraordinary twilight deciding set with it poised at 7-7 and the clock glowing at 9.39pm.

The Wimbledon champion will need to come back on Sunday for a sudden-death shootout, the like of which he has never known before in a Grand Slam, if he is to squeeze his way past the gritty German Philipp Kohlschreiber.

Murray will resume at 3-6, 6-3, 6-3, 4-6, 7-7 in his third round with three hours and 27 minutes already played, having traipsed home to bed wondering why he had not wrapped things up in time for a hearty supper.

Great Scot: Murray is a study of concentration as he plays a backhand on Saturday night

On a roll: The British No 1 will sleep with the game at 7-7 as they battle for a place in the fourth round

He
 led 3-0 in the fourth set and 2-0 in the fifth - he also led by a break
 of serve in all five sets - and faces a huge test of nerve as the 
opportunity to go deep into this tournament presents itself.

Clutching
 at his left hamstring and moving stiffly at times towards the end, 
continually chuntering at himself during changeovers, he could not put 
away the highly skilled German, who deserves plenty of credit for 
refusing to go quietly.

Kohlschreiber even managed to get a break up 
at 3-2, only for the occasion to get to him and allow Murray to hold on 
amid cliff-edge drama that should never really have been necessary.

Murray
 so rarely loses these kind of matches at Grand Slams, and this was 
further evidence just how tough the whole journey returning from back 
surgery has been. 

From dominating the fourth set, it seemed he got 
distracted by trying to finish things off for the night, and the price 
is that he must come back this afternoon to finish what is the longest 
fifth set of his career.

Murray needed to produce an immaculately 
timed backhand to save a break-point at 6-6 which would have allowed 
Kohlschreiber to serve for the match. It truly was an evening of living 
dangerously.

Wavered: Kohlschreiber took the first and fourth sets while Murray claimed the second and third

Then, with adrenalin surging through both players, he 
had a simpler backhand from mid-court in the next game that would have 
given him match-point, only to fractionally drag it wide. By the close 
he was gesturing to suggest he was struggling to see the ball, and it 
required all his bloody-minded determination to save himself, plus the 
assistance of the tour physio at three consecutive changeovers, who was 
called out to administer a rub to his thighs.

Everyone could have used a  calming massage after this one.

He needs to steel himself once again, but the fact remains that his 
self-belief is not quite the same on clay as it is on other surfaces.

Murray
 knew full well what a dangerous opponent he faced, having been thrashed
 by him in Monte Carlo four years ago, and knowing that the German was 
coming into this on a six-match winning streak. His looping 
groundstrokes give him high net clearance and consistency, and at the 
start he was swift to attack two of Murray’s weaker areas in quickly 
recovering from an early break down to reel off five games and take the 
opener.

Murray’s second serve has looked a little vulnerable this week and his opponent attacked anything short.

He
 also benefited from erratic forehand play from the British No 1, who 
repeatedly drove the ball into the net, especially when he was pushed 
out wide, which can sometimes be the case.

With no heavyweight figure
 in his box like Ivan Lendl, we saw more of the tendency to turn around 
and curse in his corner’s direction — something which never bodes well.

Waiting game: Murray will finish the match in the morning

A
 backhand volley into the net sealed the opener on Kohlschreiber’s fifth
 set-point, but the heart-ening factor for Murray was that he always 
knew he would have  openings against the German’s serve, not his 
strongest suit.

The Scot regrouped impressively and broke for 2-0, 
only for Kohlschreiber to return the compliment three games later. 
Murray attacked the Kohlschreiber serve again and when he broke for 4-2 
was able to serve out and level the match.

In the third, Murray made 
a judicious foray to the net after a deep drive to break for 3-2 and 
then rubbed in the advantage with another break at 5-3 to put himself in
 firm control of proceedings with the sun beginning to set.

At 3-0 in
 the fourth he was in utter command, then threw in two double- faults 
and lost his service rhythm — and the next five out of six games — to 
send it into a decider. Today promises to be another white-knuckle ride,
 albeit a much briefer one.

Jamie Murray’s doubles run came to an 
end as he and Australian partner John Peers lost to Bob and Mike Bryan 
in the third round. Murray was playing at this stage at Roland Garros 
for the first time, but the defending champion Bryan brothers won 6-3, 
6-1 in 49 minutes.
