Documentary victory was quite literally snatched from the jaws of defeat when a grizzly bear tried to munch a cameraman's new gadget and it survived with the footage intact.

Chris Weston, a British wildlife photographer, watched in horror as a flashing light on his expensive new camera caught the attention of a 500lb bear in the Katmai Peninsula, Alaska.

Mr Weston had bought and unwrapped the gadget days earlier in preparation for the shoot, which focused on the relationship between grizzlies and salmon in the northern-most American state.

His horror turned to delight, however,
 as he realised that not only did the camera survive the bear's powerful
 jaws, but it also captured rare footage of inside the predator's mouth.

It wasn't long though until a bear's curiosity was piqued by the expensive camera's flashing recording light

An initial swipe of the paw confirmed that the strange creature wasn't going to run away...

The bear peers down at the camera, sniffing its plastic shell before...

... having a munch of the hi tech gadget - much to the horror of Mr Weston, who was hiding nearby

'I was crossing my fingers and 
anything else I could cross in the hope that the camera was still 
recording,' he told Caters News Agency.

'It then occurred to me that there was a good chance I wasn't going to get the camera back.

'I
 have had experience of a bear eating a camera hard-case I was testing 
once, so I knew how much damage a bear could cause to even tough 
plastic.

'But the camera was
 completely unmarked except for one small mark on the plastic cover, so I
 was astonished that it was not only undamaged but also still happily 
recording away.'

A grizzly bear plays with Chris Weston's expensive new camera in the Katmai Peninsula, Alaska

Mr Weston, a British wildlife photographer, watched in horror as a flashing light on his expensive new camera caught the attention of the 500lb grizzly bear who was wading in a river in the Katmai Peninsula, Alaska

Mr Weston had bought and unwrapped the gadget days earlier in preparation for the shoot, which focused on the relationship between grizzlies and salmon in the northern-most American state

Mr Weston's horror turned to delight, however, as he realised that not only did the camera survive the bear's powerful jaws, but it also captured rare footage of the sharp teeth inside the predator's mouth

Mr Weston had carefully set the camera to capture footage about the relationship of bears and salmon

Mr Weston, who has over eight years experience photographing bears, went on: 'This segment of the film was about the connection between the salmon, the bears and the land in this region of the States.

'This was the very first time I had used the GoPro camera, which cost about Â£300.

'I placed the camera in shallow water to try and record some footage of bears chasing salmon through the shallows.

'However, this bear became intrigued by the camera, we think maybe because of the flashing recording light.'

Wild and free, the grizzly bear peers out across its domain - unaware that it is being watched

Perhaps realising that it is being spied on by curious onlookers, the bear blows a raspberry

Monique Brignoni accompanied Mr Weston on the trip to Alaska. She captured the whole incident as they hid at a safe distace, about 50 metres away.

Mr Weston said: 'Working with bears over many years, I have had many close encounters but never something quite as up close and personal as this.

'In terms of excitement and anticipation of seeing the results, this was up there with the best.

'When we viewed the footage back on the boat, the entire crew, who had experience with working with the BBC, were whooping and hollering with amazement.'
