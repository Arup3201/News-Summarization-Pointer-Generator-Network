New Jersey Governor Chris Christie and Arizona Sen. John McCain let their hair down on Saturday night at a party in the Hamptons.

At the urging of entertainer Jamie Foxx, the Republican politicians got on stage at separate points during Foxx's medley to shake their groove things at a star-studded fundraiser benefiting the Apollo Theater.

According to the New York Post's Page Six column, Christie showed off some 'rambunctious gyrating,' and McCain did the robot.

'It's the ones you don't expect. It's the Republicans. Republicans love to dance in the Hamptons,' Foxx told the audience afterward.

'Mr. McCain, you want to get up and show us something?' Foxx said, bidding McCain to come to the front

At last year's fundraiser, Foxx coaxed retired four-star general and former Secretary of State Colin Powell to join his on-stage dance party during a cover of Blurred Lines.

The annual Apollo in the Hamptons party raises money for the historic Harlem theater. This year's event was held at the East Hampton home of theater board member Ronald Perelman and raised $4 million for the historic Harlem theater, according to Page Six, with tables at the barn party costing between $50,000 - $100,000

Barbra Streisand, Paul McCartney, Robert DeNiro, Anjelica Huston, Lorne Michaels, Howard Stern, George Stephanopolous, Bill O'Reilly and Harvey Weinstein were among the guests at the fundraiser, which has become a must-attend event for New York's elite class.

Christie and his wife attended the event as guests of legendary singer and New Jersey native Jon Bon Jovi, who performed at the event along with Gladys Knight, Sting, The Roots and Pharrell Williams, and sat at a table that included DeNiro and Stern.

'Christie, I know you got a dance in you,' Foxx called out to the New Jersey politician

In the midst of Foxx's set, during which he sang renditions of hit singles Gold Digger and Blame It and did an impression of Ray Charles, he called Christie on stage to strut his stuff.

'Christie, I know you got a dance in you,' Foxx said, according to the Wall Street Journal.

The New Jersey Governor leaped on stage to chanting from the crowd and proceeded to show off his best dance moves.

Foxx invited Christie to stay for a rendition of Single Ladies, but Christie misunderstood, the Journal said, and went back to his seat.

Perelman, McCartney and Spike Lee danced with Foxx, too, before the actor turned musician invited McCain to the stage.

'Mr. McCain, you want to get up and show us 
something? Come on everyone, "McCain! McCain! McCain!"' ' Foxx hollered, per the Journal.

After McCain finished his solo, Foxx explained that he called the politicians up because they looked like they were having a good time.

'I saw Chris Christie and he was jamming. I looked down at McCain and he was like, 'I can do this.'

Christie's moves drew the praise of Jack Nicholson, who told Page Six after the party: 'That was one hell of a night. Christie really held his own.

'I told him, as he walked back to his seat, "Governor, you can’t let New Jersey down,"' ' Nicholson added.

Christie is a presumed 2016 presidential candidate and is a frontrunner for the Republican nomination.

McCain was Republicans' nominee in 2008.
