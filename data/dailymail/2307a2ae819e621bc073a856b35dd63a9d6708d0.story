Along with the hoverboard and time travelling Delorean, self-tying shoelaces were an iconic invention featured in the Back To The Future film franchise.

Now they have become a reality and you can even buy a pair for $175CAD (£99).

Inventors in St Hubert, Canada, have created a pair of trainers where the laces automatically tighten when a wearer slips their feet inside.

They claim that the ‘Powerlace auto-lacing system’ lets people tie their laces without using their hands when their weight automatically engages the system’s mechanism.

A small lever at the lower rear end of the shoe activates the system so that the energy needed to tie the shoelaces comes from the weight of the wearer’s body.

During Back To The Future II, Marty McFly, played by Michael J. Fox, puts on a pair of Nike High Tops that automatically tighten and adjust to fit his feet - using so-called power laces.

The laces automatically on the trainers tighten when a wearer slips their feet inside them.

A ‘presser’ that’s hidden in the sole of the shoes, transmits power when a wearer steps on them to the lacing mechanism.

Their weight pulls the laces tight and the maximum amount of tension can be manually adjusted using a ‘lace lock’.

To loosen the trainers, wearers have to pull a small 'lever' on the back of the shoe. 

Nike also plans on selling power laces next year, according to designer Tinker Hatfield, which will be the same year in which the much loved film is set.

Speaking at the Jordan Brand Flight Lab in New Orleans in February, he told Sole Collector: 'Are we gonna see power laces in 2015? To that, I say yes!'

While the Powerlace system may not look as dynamic as Marty McFly’s in the film, the inventors claim that their adjustable tension design system guarantees the best fit and comfort every time.

The shoes contain hidden components that allow the laces to tighten automatically, including the 'presser,' which is concealed in the shoe's sole in the heel area.

The 'puller' (pictured) provides the connection between the tension applied by the mechanism and the direct pressure applied by the lacing. The laces are designed to support tension exceeding 250lbs

'The presser serves as a force sensor and transmits this power directly to the lacing mechanism using a very clever, but subtle process,' according to the Kickstarter website.

The sole of the shoe also conceals the lever and is made from thermo polyurethane to be flexible and absorb stress.

'The puller' provides the connection between the tension applied by the mechanism and the direct pressure applied by the lacing.

Made from nylon, the laces are designed to support tension exceeding 250lbs (113kg) and a 'lace lock' enables a wearer to decide how tight they like their shoes to be.

To loosen the trainers, wearers have to pull a small lever on the back of the shoe.

The auto-lacing shoes are available to order via Kickstarter for $175 CAD (£99) and will ship in May 2015, providing the company raises enough cash to put them into production.

Rumours about the technology have been circling since 2010 when Nike applied for a patent for 'automatically lacing trainers.'

It said: 'The automatic lacing system provides a set of straps that can be automatically opened and closed to switch between a loosened and tightened position of the upper.

The company released a limited range of McFly's Nike MAGs with manual laces in 2011.

Only 1,500 models of the High Tops were made, and every pair was auctioned off on eBay.

A total of $6million (£3.5million) was raised from the sales of these shoes, and all the proceeds went to the Michael J. Fox Foundation for Parkinson’s Research.
