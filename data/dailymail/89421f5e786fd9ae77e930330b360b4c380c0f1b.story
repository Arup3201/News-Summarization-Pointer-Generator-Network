Guilty: Former deputy headmaster Derek Farrand, 59, was jailed for four and a half years after sexually abusing a 12-year old girl whilst he was helping her recover from a previous rape ordeal

A former deputy headmaster sexually abused a 12-year old girl whilst he was helping her recover from a previous rape ordeal.

Derek Farrand, 59, became infatuated with the girl after meeting her through family friends shortly before he retired from his job at a high school.

He initially bought her gifts including sweets, drinks and even a mobile phone to win her trust before subjecting her to a string of attacks.

Depraved Farrand also took a picture of himself abusing the girl and sexually assaulted her older sister.

The attack took place after Farrand found out the girl had been subjected to a previous rape which led to her attacker being jailed.

The former deputy headteacher at Palatine High School in Blackpool, Lancaster, was branded a 'traitor' by his victims' family after he was jailed for four and a half years.

The girls' parents said: 'I wish they had locked him up and thrown away the key. But at least now he can't hurt anyone else the way he has hurt us.'

In a statement they added: 'We are having to move house now because he knows where we live. The betrayal was immense. We trusted him from the background he came from, he was an ex-deputy headteacher.

'It's been a very distressing few months, when it all came out it was like somebody had ripped my heart out and torn it to shreds.

Farrand, who left his job in 2009, touched the older sister's leg
and inappropriately touched the younger girl, Minshull Street Crown Court, Manchester heard.

Banned: Farrand was banned from working with children again and ordered to sign the sex offenders register at Minshull Street Crown Court, Manchester

He was arrested last June when his 
partner discovered hundreds of pornographic images on his computer 
including pictures of his young victim. When confronted Farrand turned 
himself into police.

Mr Alaric Bassano, prosecuting said: 'In a victim personal statement the younger girl said she felt horrible 
and hated the defendant. She regarded him as a traitor. He had abused their friendship and betrayed the trust placed in him'

Farrand of Heywood, near Rochdale, admitted sexual assault and taking or making indecent images of a child and was ordered to sign the Sex Offender Register 
for an indefinite period.

He was also given a lifetime ban from 
working with children under the terms of a Sexual Offences Prevention 
Order and was ordered not to contact the victim's family under the terms
of a restraining order.Â 

In mitigation defence counsel Graham 
Campbell said: This was not a case where the defendant deliberately set
out to groom young girls. 'He was a man who had served his community 
well as a teacher and has now thrown all that away.'

Judge Jeffrey Lewis told him: 'By committing 
these offences you betrayed the innocence of their childhood.'

Deputy: Palatine High School in Blackpool where Farrand was previously employed as deputy headteacher

After the case, Detective Sargent Lindsay Booth of 
Greater Manchester Police said: 'The two girls have coped well all the 
way through - but the effect on them is going to be there for a long 
time to come.

'It was a breach of trust and that will 
be particularly difficult to overcome for both of them. The elder girl 
really felt she needed to be in court for her younger sister who 
couldn't be there, and I hope that brings a bit of closure to them.'

'Even though the custodial sentence 
might seem short in some people's view it will have an impact on him for
the rest of his life. He will never work with children again, and it's 
going to have a big impact on him.'

The girls' uncle said: 'This is a punishment which is well deserved and he should serve every day of his sentence. People should know what he has done and I actually think he should have been given an even longer punishment.'
