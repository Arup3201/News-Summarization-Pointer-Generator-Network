Petr Cech says he may leave Chelsea if he continues to be left on the bench.

Cech, who has been at Chelsea since 2004, has not started a Premier League game this season having fallen behind Thibaut Courtois in the pecking order after the Belgium goalkeeper returned from a loan spell at Atletico Madrid.

'I have not spoken to anyone, but I think they know me well enough at the club (Chelsea) to know that the situation is definitely not the way I would imagine,' Cech told Czech radio while on international duty.

The Czech Republic keeper got his chance after Courtois (seated) was injured against Arsenal 

'With the Euros (in 2016) and the national team in mind, there is no time for me to sit on the bench and not to play. 

'If the situation will not start to improve for me, then I will want to solve it.' 

Cech is set to start for the Czech Republic against Turkey in a European Championship qualifier on Friday. 

The 32-year-old featured for the first time this season when he replaced the injured Courtois during Chelsea's 2-0 win over Arsenal on Sunday.
