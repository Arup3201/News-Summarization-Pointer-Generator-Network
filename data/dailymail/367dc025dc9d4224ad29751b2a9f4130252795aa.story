Oreo is to release a limited-edition pumpkin spice take on the classic cookie, MailOnline can exclusively reveal.

The new variety, which will hit U.S. shelves nationwide later this month, features a bright orange pumpkin cream filling sandwiched between two buttery vanilla wafers.

‘We knew there was a strong demand for all things pumpkin-flavored as fall approaches, so we wanted to create our own twist on this classic seasonal favorite,’ Danielle Brown, Brand Manager at Mondelēz International said.

‘Our new limited-edition flavor, Pumpkin Spice Oreo, embodies the perfect mix of the classic Golden Oreo cookie taste with a new pumpkin spice flavor crème. We believe we’ve achieved the ideal mix for the pumpkin spice fanatic!’

But the development of the limited-edition cookie was no overnight stab in the dark. 

‘It generally takes about 12-18 months for a flavor to go from internal concept to public product available on store shelves,’ Brown added.

‘With the fast approach of fall, we knew fans were hungry for what’s next and we’re excited to help them celebrate the change of season.’

The FEMAIL team was lucky enough to receive an early sample of the cookies and shared them out among the staff. The feedback was largely positive – even from those who aren't typically fans of pumpkin flavors.  

‘Biting into this cookie was like eating a forkful of freshly baked pumpkin pie,’ said one taster. ‘It’s like a pumpkin pie exploded in my mouth!’ said another. 

The Pumpkin Spice Oreo even won favor over Starbucks’ popular seasonal latte. ‘I want to marry them. I’d much rather eat a handful of these than get a pumpkin spice latte at Starbucks,’ a FEMAIL reporter concluded.

The reviews weren't all as glowing as the pumpkin crème filling though. ‘The color of the pumpkin spice filling is terrifying,’ offered another taster. ‘I guess if they’re going for a Halloween vibe it fits. I’m not the biggest fan of pumpkin anything, so the flavor was not my favorite.’

Pumpkin Spice OREO cookies will arrive on store shelves starting September 24, one day after the official start of fall.
