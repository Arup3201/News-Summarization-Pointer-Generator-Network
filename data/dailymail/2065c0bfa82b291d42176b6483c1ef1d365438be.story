Camps are usually dark and damp dwellings hidden hundreds of metres below the surface - apart from this spectacular Chinese 'rainbow cave.'

The 180 million year-old cave has been lit up by an array of  multi-coloured mood lighting, showcasing its impressive array of  stalactites, stone pillars and rock formations.

Located northeast of the Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region, the Reed Flute Cave is a famous tourist attraction.

Spectacular sight: Camps are usually dark and damp dwellings hidden hundreds of metres below the surface... except this spectacular Chinese 'rainbow cave'

Dazzling: Blue has been used to create an eerie atmosphere in a deep recess of the 180million year old cave, while red has been used where limestone formations can be spotted to make them appear dazzling

The cave got its name from the verdant reeds growing outside which can be made into flutes.

Retired nurse Helminadia Jabur, 36, from Indonesia took the pictures while she was on holiday in the region.

'I
have a friend who is from this part of China and she has always told me
incredible stories about this place,' said Helminadia.

'There are large numbers of stalactites, stalagmites and rock formations in weird and wonderful shapes.'

Tourist books advise that if you make a strike on some of the stone-screens, a melody rings around the cave.

It takes an hour to complete a tour of the cave which is 250 metres in depth and 500 metres in length.

Local people believe the ancient gods of China live in this deep place below the earth.

Each formation has a legendary or poetic name such as Crystal Palace, Dragon Pagoda, and Virgin Forest in keeping with Chinese tradition.
