A Cornish pensioner may have netted a place in the record books after hooking an 8ft-long, 221lb part-albino catfish, thought to be the biggest of its kind ever caught.

The aptly named Tom Herron, 68, from Launceston, battled the cream-coloured monster fish in the River Segre, Mequinenza, Spain, for 40 minutes before finally hauling it in.

But the most remarkable thing about his record-breaking catch? The previous world-beater had been caught just under two hours earlier when John Edwards, from the north of England, hauled in a 209lb catfish. That 7ft 11in fish had beaten a record set in November last year of 205lbs.

But it was quickly eclipsed by Mr Herron's fish which, once ashore, was weighed and photographed before being released back into the river.

Mr Herron, a retired printer, said the fish were wild in a deep river about 100 metres wide. 'When the fish took the bait it took me 40 minutes to haul it in, it was a nightmare,' he said.

'When its head came out of the water I thought, "Crikey, it's enormous, about a metre wide."

'After it had been weighed and photographed the fish was taken back into the river and released.

'It is a sport so we put them back, two of the guides stayed with the fish until they were satisfied it had enough oxygen in its lungs then they let it go.

It was Mr Herron's third trip to the River Segre, which is about two hours south of Barcelona, but he says his age means it could be his last.

'From when you arrive in Barcelona you spend 18 hours a day, six days a week, on the river bank,' he said. 'From early morning you can fish until midnight.'

He said his wife Deborah has not accompanied him on his trips. He said: 'It is not a holiday place, there is no shopping.

'You just go there to fish.'

An expert catfish angler from Catmaster Tours, who organised the trip, said they had reeled two or three big albino catfish out of the river before, but few that had topped 200lbs.

'Albino catfish of that size are very rare indeed,' he said. 'This is the biggest we've ever seen.'

Mr Herron was joined on his fishing trip by Andy Cooper, from Canworthy Water, who himself landed a 205lb specimen.

The group were fishing on September 23 accompanied by their guide Ashley Scott.

'What a day it was,' said Mr Scott, adding that in all his years as a guide he had never seen a brace of part albino cats, let alone two world records.
