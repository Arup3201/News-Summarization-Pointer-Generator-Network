A second former Fianna Fáil minister is under
investigation over allegations of mobile-phone expenses fraud, the Irish Mail
on Sunday can reveal.

Fraud squad detectives are formally investigating a
series of allegedly bogus expense claims submitted by former TD and junior
minister Ned O’Keeffe.

The investigation by officers at the Garda Bureau of
Fraud Investigation has been running in tandem with the separate probe into the
expense claims of Ivor Callely, the former TD, junior minister and senator.

Inquiry: Senator Callely in Cork in 2010, after our exposé into his bogus expenses claims

Mr Callely was arrested and released without charge this
week and a file was sent to the DPP. The investigation was sparked by MoS
revelations in August 2010 that Mr Callely had claimed almost €3,000 in mobile
phone expenses using receipts that could not be genuine.

The controversial former minister later accepted that the
receipts were bogus but insists he is innocent and that somebody else was
responsible for the fakes. If he is charged and convicted, he could face up to
10 years in jail for obtaining money using a ‘false instrument’.

Weeks after the Callely exposé, the MoS revealed that his
Fianna Fáil colleague Mr O’Keeffe had also claimed over €2,200 in mobile-phone
expenses using receipts that could not be genuine.

However, while Senator Callely’s bogus claims were
immediately looked into by the Oireachtas authorities – who then passed the
matter on to gardaí and the DPP – Leinster House officials took no action
against Mr O’Keeffe.

Despite being made aware of the evidence against Mr
O’Keeffe, the Oireachtas authorities – headed by Dáil Clerk Kieran Coughlan –
have never investigated. Mr Coughlan himself has repeatedly insisted that the
expenses were legitimate and that there was no question of a bogus invoice
being submitted or accepted.

Mr Coughlan allowed Mr O’Keeffe to submit fresh paperwork
‘correcting’ the information in one disputed invoice – and has ever since
insisted the claim was ‘properly made’.

This stance seems to contradict the view taken by gardaí,
who appear to believe the former minister has questions to answer.

Six months after our revelations, Mr O’Keeffe retired
when the general election was called in February 2011.

However, a Garda investigation into Mr O’Keeffe’s
expenses was formally launched in September 2011 after our evidence was handed
over to GBFI detectives.

The dossier includes three invoices that Mr O’Keeffe
submitted to claim €2,237.53 in expenses from the Oireachtas.

The invoices were all on headed note paper apparently
from TR Motor Services Ltd – a respected Mercedes dealership in Harold’s Cross,
south Dublin.

Mr O’Keeffe’s invoices were not questioned by the Dáil
authorities and he was paid the full amount on the invoices.

But as soon as the MoS saw the three receipts, a number
of irregularities were immediately apparent.

One issue was that the invoices appeared to have been
printed on standard headed paper. When the MoS obtained a genuine invoice from
TR Motor Services, it was markedly different to the amateurish versions
submitted by Mr O’Keeffe.

The documents provided to the Oireachtas by Mr O’Keeffe
also had no invoice numbers: a TR Motors accounts employee insisted that all
the firm’s invoices carry such a number.

In addition, just one of the invoices bore a VAT number –
another standard feature of any legitimate sales docket.

Moreover, all of the invoices had charged VAT at the
incorrect rate of 13.5%. The Revenue confirmed to the MoS that the correct VAT
rate for installing mobile phone kits at the time was 21%.

But possibly the most glaring aspect of the invoices was
the amount involved, which seemed impossibly high for the goods and services
listed.

For example, one of the invoices bills €330 in labour
charges even though no labour is required to install the component listed.

Crucially, the MoS also established that TR Motors’ own
accounts did not show the firm having received all of the payments claimed by
Mr O’Keeffe.

Mr O’Keeffe has always insisted the invoices are genuine
and that he got them ‘free and fair’.

Dáil expenses will now be kept secret

The Oireachtas has introduced a new expenses system under
which it will be almost impossible to root out bogus claims like Ivor
Callely’s.

 Until recently,
any claims for vouched expenses had to be backed up with a receipt which was
then retained by the Oireachtas.

 It was the
examination of such receipts which allowed the Irish Mail on Sunday to show
that Ivor Callely’s mobile phone claims were based on fake invoices – leading
directly to his arrest last week.

Exposé: How the MoS broke the story of O’Keeffe’s claims, now being investigated by Gardaí

Now, however, the
rules have been changed so that TDs and Senators will not have to supply
receipts – even for supposedly ‘vouched’ expenses.

They will simply
claim for amounts they say they have spent, with the Oireachtas trusting them
to give accurate figures.

The only method of
policing the claims is a system of random audits, under which one in ten
politicians will be asked to provide the receipts to back up their claims.

However, for 90%
of politicians, no receipts will ever have to be handed over – meaning that the
invoices cannot be checked to ensure they are genuine.

TDs and Senators
will be obliged to hold on to the receipts for five years, but unless they are
audited, there is no means by which a member of the media or public can ever
get their hands on them – even by using Freedom of Information legislation.

Expenses
campaigner and chartered accountant Enid O’Dowd said that even if invoices were
genuine, there could be abuses.

‘There are no
rules insisting on value for money, or that the work does not go to family or
friends for these expenses.

‘So legitimately,
a TD could give a newsletter printing contract at an inflated price to a party
supporter or cousin. Because we can’t get the invoices under FoI, we can’t
check for this, and the auditors won’t – it’s not within their remit.’

Ms O’Dowd warned
that the new policy was further erosion of our ability to check how politicians
are spending our money.

She said: ‘Only a
minority of the expenses paid to our politicians can be subject to audit as
most payments are fixed allowances paid automatically with no necessity to ever
show that anything like the amount paid was actually incurred.

‘This audit
related to only 10% of the TDs and Senators who opted for the higher allowance
– why not look at those who opt to be paid the lower allowance of €15,000 per
annum. I call this the “no questions asked” allowance.

‘The fact that
something like half our politicians opt for the lower figure tells me that they
have very few legitimate parliamentary expenses and that the allowance is a
form of untaxed salary for them.’

The Irish Mail on
Sunday has obtained a copy of the first independent audit of these vouched
expenses. Prepared by Mazars, the audit raises a series of issues about the
Oireachtas expenses regime and its loose rules.

It said there were
no firm rules on what could and could not be claimed by TDs and Senators in a
number of key areas.

Amongst the items
purchased, which had to be signed off without clear guidelines, were: bank
interest and fees, the purchase of computer equipment, and ‘sundry items’ like
newspapers, biscuits, tea and coffee.

The audit report
said: ‘During our audit we noted a number of expenditure claims which do not
appear to have official guidelines as to whether they are allowable or not.’

 It said clarity
was necessary on the purchase of items such as laptops and printers, and
particularly whether they should be returned to the Oir-eachtas if the
politicians eventually lose their seat.

A source in
Leinster House said: ‘The issue here is whether that politician then owns the
equipment even though they have used somebody else’s money to buy it.’

The report also
said there was an issue in relation to the funding of advertising by TDs and
Senators for party colleagues using public funds.

According to
guidelines, adverts should simply state the most basic information about when
constituency clinics were being held.

But in a number of
cases, it appears other information including slogans and joint advertisements
with party members were being paid for by the taxpayer.

The report said:
‘We consider that further clarity should be provided to members as to these
conditions which must be met and the criteria in order to be a qualifying
expense.’ It further noted problems with telephone bills: ‘The level of detail of evidence submitted
varied for this expenditure category… [it] should show the member’s telephone
numbers assigned for the relevant period for public representation purposes.’

Another problem
noted in the report was the hiring of meeting rooms.

The Houses of the
Oireachtas had decided in March 2010 to create the two expenses options  – the lower ‘unvouched’ payment with no
audit, or a higher ‘vouched’ payment that could be subject to audit.

A statement said:
‘The core purpose of this audit was to establish whether members had valid
evidence of vouchers, receipts and bills in respect of the amount paid to them.

‘The Audit Report
also includes the auditors’ recommendations to provide further definition and
clarity.’

The Oireachtas defended
the new procedures, saying: ‘The audit of the public representation allowance
was conducted… [to facilitate] the first audit of expenses of a random sample
of members and preparation of the audit report for the Houses of the
Oireachtas.

‘Members who were in receipt of vouched allowance amounts
must retain the evidence of the expenses incurred, for inspection only, to an
auditor appointed by the Oireachtas Commission.’
