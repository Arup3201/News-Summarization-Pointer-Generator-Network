An elderly couple driving home from a visit to their granddaughter were pulled over and ordered out of their car by a heavy-handed sheriff's deputy, who subjected them to a 20-minute interrogation about heroin smuggling.

Cancer sufferer Charles Tharp, 69, and his wife found themselves confronted with a sniffer dog and asked whether they had heroin, methamphetamines ir ecstasy stashed in their Toyota.

The overzealous sheriff's deputy pulled the pair over on a highway in Walton County, Georgia, and took issue with their window tint before moving on to illegal narcotics.

Drug interrogation: Charles Tharp, 69, was ordered out of his Toyota by an overzealous deputy in Walton County, Georgia

Couple: Tharp and his wife, who has not been named, were asked whether they had a variety of narcotics, including heroin and ecstasy, in their car

Dashcam footage of the ordeal, obtained by CBS46, shows Tharp, who suffers back pain, standing outside for the duration of the stop in blustery weather.

The deputy can be heard asking which drugs Tharp might have in the car. He lists methamphetamines, heroin and ecstasy in turn, to which Tharp replies 'no, sir' each time.

The officer had initially said that the windows on Tharp's Toyota, which are factory-issue, were tinted too darkly.

He took a measurement at the roadside which seemingly confirmed his suspicion - but it was later disproved by a test from the car's dealership.

Unusual vacation: The Tharps were driving home through Georgia after a visit to the granddaughter, above, who lives in Texas

The Tharps were only passing through Georgia the time. They were on their way home to North Carolina after visiting their granddaughter in Texas.

In response to the unexpected stop, Tharp said: 'I don't honestly know what the stereotype looks like for a heroin smuggler.

'But I don't think a couple of senior citizens driving a handicapped license plate car with their little cocker spaniel really looks like we're much of a threat to anybody.'

Walton County Sheriff's Department are now investigating the incident. A spokesman for the department admitted: 'In hindsight, maybe he did go a little far'.
