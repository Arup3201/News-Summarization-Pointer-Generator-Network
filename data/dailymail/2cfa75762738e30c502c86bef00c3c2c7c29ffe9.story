By day Alisha Smith is a respected prosecution lawyer in the New York state Attorney General’s Office on a decent salary of almost $80,000.

But by night the 36-year-old reportedly turns into dominatrix ‘Alisha Spark’ - paid for restraining and whipping people at S&M events, a source said.

Prosecutor Ms Smith is known to wear transparent skin-tight latex outfits with heart-shaped pasties while she is performing outside the office.

She has now been suspended without pay immediately by the state Attorney General following inquiries by the New York Post.

‘They pay her to go to the events,’ a fetish source told the New York Post. ‘She dominates people, restrains them and whips them.’

This is in stark contrast to just three years ago, when she was praised by the then attorney general Andrew Cuomo, now state governor.

He congratulated her for work in getting a $5billion settlement from Bank of America and other organisations in a case of securities fraud.

A spokesman for state Attorney General Eric Schneiderman confirmed she had been suspended but would not say why.

But sources told the New York Post say her suspension is probably only because she has profited from the work.

S&M source

Employees of the state Attorney General’s Office must get prior approval for outside work that could generate them more than $1,000.

Last month she tweeted about sexual lubricants to her friend and dominatrix Jade Vixen, whose real name is Edythe Maa.

A source told the New York Post the two women often attend fetish parties and have been seen working together on one submissive.

Neither Ms Smith nor her lawyer, Marshall Mintz, have yet commented.
