Jill Greenberg is bored with the 'controversy' rumbling around her photographs.

The portrait artist's beautifully stylised and highly emotive images of very young, damp-cheeked children sobbing up close to her camera lens drew accusations of 'child abuse' when they were first seen in 2006.

But the New York-based mother-of-two, who has now released a collection of the photos as a stunning hardback art book with D.A.P. and Madrid-based TF Editores, says she had no intention of creating such a stir with her images, and was shocked to have actually received hate mail as a result of them.

The Truth: Jill Greenberg's photos depict crying children but were intended to reflect her dissatisfaction with Bush-era politics in 2006

The Rapture Index: Jill Greenberg used her daughter, her daughter's friends and some child models in the photos

Speaking to MailOnline, Greenberg said: 'Children at that age cry as a form of communication since they can't use their words, its not evidence of pain.'

'Making children cry for a photographer can be considered mean,' she continued in Slate Magazine. speaking to Jordan G Teicher. 'But I 
would say that making children laugh and show off their jeans for an 
apparel ad is just as exploitative and less natural. Toddlers' natural 
state, like 30 per cent of the time, is crying.'

To get the children welling up, Greenberg and the infants' mothers would offer the tots sweets and chocolate or something just as tantalising, such as a mobile phone, then stop short of handing them over, prompting a tantrum.

In a statement about the collection on her website, Greenberg says: 'Nothing is more pure than the anguish of a child. Pictures of children crying capture raw emotion: sputtering rage and profound loss.

'In many ways we’ve become desensitized to disturbing image. But the honesty of a child's feelings is undeniable and it draws you in to the photograph. Perhaps because kids experience the kind of powerful emotions that we, as adults, have suppressed in ourselves.'

Continuing, she wrote: 'The children I photographed were not harmed in any way. And, as a mother, I am quite aware of how easily toddlers can cry. Storms of grief sweep across their features without warning; a joyful smile can dissolve into a grimace of despair.

'The first little boy I shot, Liam, suddenly became hysterically upset. It reminded me of helplessness and anger I feel about our current political and social situation.

'It made me think of my outrage at our false reasons for going to war in Iraq and the scandalous way in which the conflict was sold to the American people. I thought of George W. Bush, then just sworn into his second term in office, and I decided to call the image "Four More Years".

Shock: 'The first little boy I shot, Liam, suddenly became hysterically upset. It reminded me of helplessness and anger I feel about our current political and social situation'

She said: 'As a parent I have to reckon with the knowledge that our children will suffer for the mistakes our government is making. Their pain is a precursor of that is to come'

'As any new parent will tell you, the future suddenly becomes a very serious concern. As ecstatic as I was at the birth of my daughter, I felt selfish bringing her, and later my son into our screwed-up world. I seemed to become a mother at exactly the moment things went awry.

'Of course, human beings have always been greedy, violent and dishonest. But the rise of the Christian right as a political force in this country has made the situation dire. The most dangerous fundamentalists aren’t just waging war in Iraq; they're attacking evolution, blocking medical research and ignoring the environment.

'It's as if they believe the apocalyptic End Time is near, therefore protecting the earth and the future of all our children is futile. As a parent I have to reckon with the knowledge that our children will suffer for the mistakes our government is making. Their pain is a precursor of that is to come.'

Faith? 'The children I photographed were not harmed in any way. And, as a mother, I am quite aware of how easily toddlers can cry'

Jill Greenberg isn't the only parent to have snapped children at their most teary moments.

The father behind hit Tumblr photo blog Reasons My Son Is Crying has been exploring the 'universal culture of toddler' using photos of his two sons - and the children of people from around the world - sobbing.

Greg Pembroke, from Rochester, New York, began taking mid-tantrum photos
 of his infant sons Charlie, 22 months, and William, three-and-a-half, 
and captioning the images with the (mostly unreasonable) reasons for the
 boys' tears.

The 
hilarious tags range from 'I broke his cheese in half' and 'I wiped the 
dirt off his pear', to 'we asked him to stop hitting his brother with a 
plastic wand' and 'his milk was in the wrong cup'.

Pembroke - who writes commercials for
 radio stations and is married to Charity, a physical therapist -  
initially began his light-hearted hobby by posting images and captions 
on his personal Facebook page.

But when friends began telling him they wanted to share his jokes with their own friends, they encouraged him to launch a blog.

Within five days his Tumblr page had 
gone viral, and was being featured in news outlets, websites and 
magazines all over the world. The family were invited to talk on Good 
Morning America.

Speaking to MailOnline, Pembroke 
said: 'It's so interesting. I started it for a bit of fun, and it got 
big completely by accident. The first photo we did was the cheese one. I
 broke it in half after he asked me to, and when he got upset I thought 
his reaction was so hilariously unreasonable. It went from there.

'The
 best bit is that I've been getting emails from all over the world from 
people saying they find it so relatable. It doesn't matter where in the 
world you are, the universal culture of toddler is the same.'

He continued: 'Some
 of the funniest contributions I've had are one from Australia with a 
picture
 of a little boy crying his face off because his mother unwrapped a 
chocolate biscuit. Then there's a little girl in China whose mum didn't 
pick her up quickly enouigh, and a girl in South Korea who is literally 
crying over 
spilled milk.'

Pembroke is now publishing global 
contributions to his site, and has launched a contest to find the 
funniest reason for a child crying, with the best one winning a digital 
camera, donated to him by Sony.

He said: 'I have gotten so many great pictures that I wanted to find a way to recognize some of them.'

Greg and his wife will pick the 10 best submissions and put them to a vote on Tumblr. Submissions can be entered until 15 May.
