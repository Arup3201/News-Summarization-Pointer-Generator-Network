Whitehall bureaucrats with just a few hours training have been drafted in as Britain's first line of defence against Ebola.

Around 80 civil servants will carry out checks for the deadly virus on passengers arriving at Heathrow, it has been revealed.

The volunteers will use a gun-style thermometer to take travellers' temperatures from a safe distance without physical contact.

Screening started at Heathrow a fortnight ago, but there are not enough trained staff to man the border, the Mirror reported today.

The new border bureaucrats will question travellers from countries such as Liberia, Sierra Leone and Guinea and take their temperatures.

They have been drafted in to get the system up and running while Public Health England recruit staff to work in the screening rooms.

Shadow Transport ­Secretary Mary Creagh said it was 'more evidence of this government's shambolic handling of this serious issue'.

The Labour MP added: 'Public health should not rely on people's goodwill. If there is a job to do, it should be done by properly-trained staff.'

But the Cabinet Office said the civil servants were working alongside trained medical experts who take over as soon as anyone is suspected of carrying the disease. The government also insisted that the volunteers had been given proper training.

Civil servant sent to questions travellers from West Africa will be told about how the virus is transferred and the risks they face. Officials also insist the threat of catching the disease are 'very low'.

A spokesman said: 'This Government's first priority is the safety of the British people. Trained civil servants are helping staff screening rooms as a short-term measure to deal with a serious public health issue.'

But Shadow Health minister Jamie Reed said: 'If screening at airports is going to work, Ministers must make sure there are enough health workers. A lack of staff cannot mean something so serious is left to volunteers.'

More than 10,000 people have now been infected with Ebola worldwide and around half have died, global health chiefs said over the weekend.

Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt sparked confusion when he suggested that travellers would have to volunteer to be tested. But Downing Street said the checks were compulsory.

Experts said tests are unlikely to detect infected travellers but they do provide an opportunity to tell anyone who might develop symptoms the importance of seeking medical help.
