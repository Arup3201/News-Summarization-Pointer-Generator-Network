The FDA has warned that dietary supplements being marketed to treat traumatic brain injuries such as concussion have no proof to back them up.

An alert has been issued by the FDA about products that exploit the public's concern about concussions which are 'untested, unproven and possibly dangerous.'

One company, Star Scientific, has filed an investigational new drug application, or IND, that claims its product anatabine can 'alleviate the negative consequences of traumatic brain injury (TBI).'

Warning: The FDA says products like Anatabloc are making unproven claims about their ability to aid traumatic brain injuries

'We're very concerned that false assurances of faster recovery will convince athletes of all ages, coaches and even parents that someone suffering from a concussion is ready to resume activities before they are really ready,' says Gary Coody, FDA's National Health Fraud Coordinator.

Anatabine is being marketed as a treatment for TBI, but being sold as a dietary supplement in the form of Anatabloc.

Under law, a dietary supplement may not contain an ingredient that has already been submitted for investigation as a drug.   

Political ties: Star Scientific CEO Johnnie Williams with Virginia First Lady Maureen McConnell

'While anatabine has been authorized as an investigational new drug, it is also considered a new dietary ingredient, which is subject to premarket notification,' an FDA spokeswoman said.

The seeming epidemic of suicides and debilitating neurological disorders among former footballers and soldiers means that public concern about concussions is at an all-time high.

'We first learned from the military about a product being marketed to treat TBI, obviously a concern with wounded veterans. We were taken aback that anyone would make a claim that a supplement could treat TBI, a hot-button issue,' says Jason Humbert, a senior regulatory manager with FDA's Office of Regulatory Affairs. 'That sparked our surveillance.'

Star Scientific is the third company to receive a warning for the FDA for marketing unproven TBI drugs.

Money talks: Virginia Governor Bob McConnell's term ends January 11, but he remains under investigation by the FBI for bribery after receiving $150,000 from Johnnie Williams during his term

Star Scientific has previously come in for unwanted attention over its CEO Johnnie Williams friendship with Virginia Governor Bob McDonnell.

McDonnell acknowledged receiving up to $150,000 in gifts from Williams, including $15,000 to help pay for his daughter's 2011 wedding. He's now under investigation by the FBI.

The company's website says Star Scientific's original mission was to create products using anatabine, found in tomatoes, eggplants, peppers, potatoes and tobacco to help people quit smoking.

The company says its now shifted its focus to the anti-inflammatory aspects of anatabine.

'As we continue to work on this problem, we can't guarantee you won't see a claim about TBIs,' Coody says. 'But we can promise you this: there is no dietary supplement that has been shown to prevent or treat them. If someone tells you otherwise, walk away.'
