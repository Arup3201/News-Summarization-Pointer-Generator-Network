It was on December 21 – the day Liverpool began their unbeaten run – that a bloke dressed as Jesus Christ held a sign at Anfield that read: 'Brendan, I've got your back!'

Yet divine intervention has nothing to do with it. It is Brendan Rodgers that has resurrected Liverpool by throwing out the old system and implementing the new.

Tactics in football can be as precarious as a game of rock, paper, scissors. Nothing is guaranteed, and there is always a risk, but Liverpool have found a way to expose others and not themselves.

The turning point was at Old Trafford on December 14 when Rodgers finally released his grasp on 4-2-3-1. They lost 3-0 in their 3-4-3 experiment, but that by no means tells the story.

Just 25 seconds separated the excellent David de Gea's save from Raheem Sterling at one end, and Wayne Rooney's opening goal for Manchester United at the other.

Mike Mullarkey, the linesman, failed to recognise Juan Mata was more than a yard offside when he made it two. A defensive error by Dejan Lovren created the third.

Liverpool were torn apart by preventable goals. The visitors got into scoring positions more frequently, having 19 shots to Manchester United's 11, but lacked a cutting edge.

At least they weren't as cramped as they were against Basle the week before (shown below, left), where right-back Glen Johnson (No 2) drifted inside and Sterling (No 31) led the 4-2-3-1 formation.

Liverpool's average positions in their latest win against Burnley shows they still play 3-4-3

Even though Liverpool were hit for three by Manchester United, they persisted with 3-4-3 in the next game against Bournemouth in the Capital One Cup quarter-final, and have done since.

It's helped them get 29 points since Christmas, while Merseyside rivals Everton have just 28 in total for the season. 

Just look at their 2-0 win against Burnley on Wednesday, for example (shown right).

Emre Can (No 23) dropped into the back three. Alberto Moreno (No 18), a left-back with a winger's soul, was pushed forward.

Joe Allen (No 24) and Jordan Henderson (No 14) owned central midfield in tandem, and the three-pronged attack featuring Sterling (No 31), Daniel Sturridge (No 15) and the indispensable Philippe Coutinho (No 10) worked.

They're fast, they swarm, they press, they move. It's not rocket science, yet it leaves teams bewildered.

Fit-again Sturridge started on Wednesday rather than Sterling being used in the middle, as he had been against Manchester City and Southampton. Easing Sturridge back in, as is only natural after an injury that cost five months.

Possession too, it seems, is no longer nine-tenths of the law.

Manchester City had 51 per cent against Liverpool at Anfield, yet lost 2-1. Southampton had 60 per cent, and lost 2-0. As was the case with Tottenham Hotspur, Swansea City, and so on.

Liverpool have claimed 29 points since Christmas, while rivals Everton have 28 in total for the season

Liverpool manager Brendan Rodgers made the switch from 4-2-3-1 to 3-4-3 on December 14 and it's worked

'We have restructured the team and organised the team in a different way,' Rodgers said last month, 'to get that solidity back and get the balance back both offensively and defensively.'

It sounded like one of those generic responses that roll off managers' tongues, but there was more to this.

Even at the back. Simon Mignolet was dropped for goalkeeper Brad Jones against Manchester United, but returned to the first team on Boxing Day. Since then, Liverpool have conceded the least (6) in the Premier League and have the best goal difference (+15).

No surprise, then, that a table since December 26 puts them top (29 points) ahead of Arsenal (27) and, remarkably, Stoke City (23).

Yet should we expect anything less? Rodgers has a knack for upping the ante, after all.

In 2012-13, Liverpool averaged 1.47 points per game between August and December, rising to 2.5 between January and May.

In 2013-14, they went from 1.89 to 2.53. And this year, they have gone from 1.47 to 2.56.

Only Wolfsburg (2.67) better that out of every club in the Premier League, La Liga, Serie A, Bundesliga and Ligue 1, yet Liverpool have played three more games.

And if they maintain their 2.56 average, Liverpool would end up with 77 points – enough for them to qualify for the Champions League in nine out of the past 10 years.

The return of Sturridge following a combination of thigh and calf problems helps. Without him, they average 1.3 goals per game, 1.5 points and their win percentage is a measly 42.1. With him, it rises to 1.9 goals, 2.4 points and 77.8 per cent. Who needs Luis Suarez?

Or Steven Gerrard, for that matter. Jordan Henderson has captained Liverpool eight times in the Premier League since November 29, winning seven and drawing one. They have scored 15 goals and conceded just twice when the hard-working deputy wears the armband.

No other captain in the Premier League has a better win percentage than him (88). A natural, it would seem.

Even Lucas Leiva, when not injured, provides cover for the back three as a defensive midfielder. Rodgers has a man for every occasion, and it's clicking at the right time.

If it ain't broke, don't fix it. Their luck with 3-4-3 – arguably 3-4-2-1 on occasion – may well run out, because imperfections will always be there.

The price of failing to qualify for the Champions League? Some £31.3million, give or take – not including the prize money – and the unwanted consolation of Europa League football.

Trouble is, their new system is no secret. Others will try to copy or stump them, and Rodgers must anticipate it. In 210 minutes against Chelsea in two Capital One Cup semi-final legs, after all, Liverpool scored just once and were eliminated.

It's so far, so good. All this will matter little if they don't beat Manchester United on March 22, or Arsenal on April 4, or do better against Chelsea on May 9.

Ripping up the blueprint in mid-December was a start. Time for the finish.
