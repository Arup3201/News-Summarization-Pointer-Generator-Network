When Ross Hutchins received the all clear from cancer last July, it only took him one day to return to the courts of the All England Club for a hit with father Paul and brother Blake.

On Thursday, eleven months on, it felt as if Hutchins took another crucial step on the long road back as he walked onto Court No 11 for his first competitive match here for two years.

Although he and partner Colin Fleming lost 6-3, 4-6, 6-3, 7-6 to 16th seeds Pablo Cuevas and David Marrero, Hutchins said: ‘It felt great. This is my home club.

'I live three minutes away. It’s great to be back having missed last year. It’s the best tournament in the world. It’s what you want to perform well in.

'We played okay but didn’t perform to our absolute best. We got outplayed a little bit.’

As Hutchins attempts to work his way up the doubles rankings from No 143, however, it is not ideal that he and Fleming have now suffered first-round losses at the last two Grand Slams.

Hutchins gets a protected ranking of No 29 due to his illness — which he uses to enter tournaments — but it will soon expire which means he may have to drop down to the second-tier Challenger level if he and Fleming do not have a good run soon.

Down but not out: Colin Fleming and Hutchins lost 6-3, 4-6, 6-3, 7-6 to Pablo Cuevas and David Marrero
