Casualty departments are being given a 'calming' overhaul in a bid to stop patients losing their temper with staff.

From clearer information on waiting times and treatment to a refurbishment of waiting rooms, measures are being put in place to reduce anxiety in a hospital's busiest department.

It comes after figures show attacks on Health Service workers have risen to record levels, with almost 60,000 assaults on NHS staff in England reported during 2010-11.

Under attack: Designers,
psychologists and healthcare experts were commissioned to come up with 
innovative ways to keep people calm in waiting rooms and protect NHS workers

New features are likely to include bus stop-style screens with live updates to keep people up to date with waiting times.

A Department of Health spokeswoman said that designers,
psychologists and healthcare experts were commissioned to come up with 
innovative ways to keep people calm in waiting rooms.

The year-long project, which was run 
by the Design Council, discovered ways to ease patients' frustration and
anxiety and to help them understand why they might have to wait, the 
spokeswoman said.

Patients are likely to see screens 
giving live updates about the number and types of cases that staff are 
dealing with. Waiting rooms will also display clear signs and maps 
explaining the different stages of treatment.

A new approach should be taken to how patients are greeted in the units, it was suggested.

For managers planning refurbishments, there is specific advice about lighting, decor and seating.

The suggestions will now be tested in 
three NHS Foundation Trusts - Chesterfield Royal Hospital, University 
Hospital Southampton and Guy's and St Thomas' in London.

Attacks on NHS staff are thought to cost at least £69 million a year, the spokeswoman said.

Figures published last week showed there were 57,830 assaults on doctors, 
nurses, paramedics and ambulance crews in England during 2010/11 – up 
1,112 compared with the year before.

Almost 70 per cent of the attacks 
involved patients not responsible for their actions because of  medical 
conditions, an adverse reaction to  treatment, mental health problems or
severe  learning difficulties.

Fewer than one in 40 attacks ended in a prosecution.

Health Minister Simon Burns said any violence and aggression towards staff is 'totally unacceptable'.

'NHS staff work hard to save lives 
every day and they should be able to carry out their work without fear 
of assault, be it verbal or physical,' he said.

'We want to safeguard staff and 
patients and that is why we asked the Design Council to look at helping A
and E departments become calmer and safer environments.

Concerns: Dr Peter Carter said that one attack on a NHS staff member was too much

'These are practical solutions to help
support and reduce the pressure on busy staff - ways in which hospitals
can easily redesign the environment according to their budget and how 
difficult situations can be diffused by simply giving patients more 
information.'

Design Council chief executive officer
David Kester added: 'For not much more than £60,000 hospitals can now 
quickly and easily install this system which could significantly reduce 
the burden of aggression from patients.'

Dr Peter Carter, chief executive and 
general secretary of the Royal College of Nursing, last week raised the 
concern that attacks could increase further if NHS budget cutbacks 
affect services.

He said ‘I am appalled by the fact that nearly 58,000 physical assaults 
have taken place in England against our hard working NHS staff this 
year. 

‘Quite frankly one is too many. No one goes to work expecting to be 
assaulted and this is all the more upsetting when we consider that some 
members of the public are attacking the very people trying to help them.

‘Assaults on staff are never justified, but the worry is that if 
pressures increase and people wait longer, the levels of frustration 
will rise. 

'It is somewhat reassuring that sanctions have increased and I hope that
this will go some way towards acting as a deterrent. Everything must be
done to prevent members of the public from carrying out threatening or 
violent acts, and those that choose to do so should be made to face the 
consequences. 

‘It is high time Trusts step up and look to invest more in prevention 
and protecting their staff from assaults in the first place.’

Christina McAnea, the Unison union’s head of health, said: ‘The increase in violence is a national disgrace. It is no good saying some of these assaults were the result of patients’ medical conditions.

‘It is clear that urgent action is needed to look after staff.’
