Switching off a certain gene could stop junk food eaters from gaining weight

Switching off a 'fat' gene could prevent you from piling on the pound even if you stick to a high-fat diet, say researchers.

A two-year study found that removing this gene in mice made them resistant to obesity. The animals showed unusual restraint when fed a high-calorie diet and were more active as well.

'When fed a diet that induces obesity
these mice donâ€™t get fat,' said study author Professor James McManaman from the University of Colorado.

'It may be 
possible to duplicate this in humans using existing technology that 
targets this specific gene.'

The absence of the gene may cause fat to be broken down faster by the body, he said.

The research team created a strain of mice without the Plin2 gene, which humans also possess. It produces a protein that regulates fat storage and metabolism.

They found their fat cells were 20 per cent smaller than typical mice and did not show the kind of inflammation usually associated with obesity.

Obesity-associated fatty liver disease, common in obese humans and rodents alike, was absent in the mice without the Plin2 gene.

'The mice were healthier,' Prof McManaman said.

'They had lower triglyceride levels, they were more insulin-sensitive, they had no incidents of fatty liver disease and there was less inflammation in the fat cells.'

The findings suggest switching off the Plin2 gene may lower the risk of heart disease (triglycerides are fatty molecules involved in the hardening of the arteries) and diabetes.

'It could mean that we have finally 
discovered a way to disrupt obesity in humans. That would be a
major breakthrough,' Prof McManaman.

The team next want to know how the gene alteration works physiologically and better understand how it affects food consumption.

According to the study, understanding how Plin2 is involved in the control of energy balance will provide new insights into 'the mechanisms by which nutrition overload is detected, and how individuals adapt to, or fail to adapt to, dietary challenges.'

The study, funded by the 
National Institutes of Health was published in The Journal of Lipid Research.
