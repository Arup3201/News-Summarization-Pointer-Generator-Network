Quizzed: Former News of the World executive Neil Wallis leaves Hammersmith police station yesterday

The head of Scotland Yard was given a dressing down last night for employing a News of the World phone hacking suspect as a £1,000-a-day consultant.

Sir Paul Stephenson also faces being dragged before MPs to explain himself after sensationally admitting Neil Wallis, former executive editor of the Sunday tabloid, worked for the force for 11 months.

Wallis, 60, was employed to advise Metropolitan Police Commissioner Sir Paul and Assistant Commissioner John Yates on a part-time basis from October 2009 to September 2010.

But it was only yesterday, hours after Wallis was arrested in a dawn swoop over phone hacking allegations, that Sir Paul informed London Mayor Boris Johnson of the lucrative deal which netted Wallis £24,000.

Last night Home Secretary Theresa May and an angry Mr Johnson both demanded answers from Sir Paul about his relationship with Wallis.

Critics said it proved the relationship between the paper, closed down last Sunday, and Britain’s biggest police force ‘stank to high heaven’.

Earlier this week Sir Paul briefed the Prime Minister at Downing Street on the hacking scandal. But last night stunned sources at No 10 said the Met chief made no mention of the Wallis appointment.

He has now been summoned to explain himself before the Home Affairs Select Committee next week.

Sir Paul’s admission deepens the controversy over the Met’s handling of the hacking case. Critics claim some senior officers had been ‘too close’ to Wallis and former News of the World editors Andy Coulson and Rebekah Brooks.

Sir Paul has dined with Wallis on at least eight occasions since 2006, according to official records. Mr Yates has admitted knowing him for 12 years.

Wallis, nicknamed the ‘Wolfman’ during his Fleet Street days, landed the lucrative Scotland Yard consultancy in October 2009, five months after he left the News of the World.

Under pressure: MPs want  Metropolitan Police Commissioner Sir Paul Stephenson to explain how Scotland Yard came to employ Neil Wallis

He worked for the Yard two days a month. Because he was a consultant working from home, he was not vetted for the job, which involved advising the Commissioner on speeches.

Sources said he had to ‘provide strategic communication advice and support’ and did not advise on operational matters.

He did not have a security pass at New Scotland Yard, where he was ‘escorted at all times’.

He was appointed by the director of public affairs at Scotland Yard, Dick Fedorcio, following consultations with Sir Paul and Mr Yates.

Summons: Rupert Murdoch will appear before a Commons committee next Tuesday, and Sir Paul Stephenson may also be joining him

Last night Theresa May wrote to the Commissioner asking him to provide a ‘full picture’.

A source close to Mr Johnson said he was ‘very cross and concerned’ about the revelations. The source said the Mayor had summoned Sir Paul ‘to explain himself’ during a 90-minute showdown at London’s City Hall.

Labour MP Chris Bryant said: ‘This all stinks to high heaven. I have been saying for some time that the relationship between the Met and, in particular, the News of the World has been so close as to frankly smack of  collusion.

‘Some people may think we have got to the bottom of this – I think we are only halfway down.’

Earlier Sir Paul was forced to defend his relationship with Wallis when he appeared before the Metropolitan Police Authority.

The Met chief, who has been widely praised for his leadership of the Yard since succeeding bungle-prone Sir Ian Blair, insisted his integrity was ‘completely intact’.

Wallis, who works in PR, was arrested on suspicion of conspiring to intercept mobile phone messages in a dawn raid on his Chiswick, West London, home at 6.30am. He spent ten hours in custody before being released from Hammersmith police station.

His contract to advise the yard ceased four months before the new phone hacking probe was launched in January this year.

Coulson, 43, who was Downing Street communications chief until January this year, was himself arrested by detectives last Friday over alleged phone hacking and illegal payments to police. He was released on bail until October.
