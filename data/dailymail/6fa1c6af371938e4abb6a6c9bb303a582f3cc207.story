Eurocrats are about to demand an ‘outrageous’ budget increase of up to 12 per cent – three times the rate of inflation.

This means Britain’s contribution to running the EU – already £15.3billion a year – will rise by another £2billion.

The budget, being finalised by the European Commission, is a clear rebuff to David Cameron’s calls for belt-tightening in Brussels.

It will leave every family here handing over a total of nearly £700 a year to Europe just as they face an income squeeze.

Commission President Jose Manuel Barroso also wants to raid Britain’s budget rebate, negotiated by Margaret Thatcher, which saves taxpayers £3billion a year.

The Prime Minister had called for the EU budget to rise by no more than inflation.

But under proposals to be published this week, the Commission wants it to go up from £113.5bn by between £9billion and £14billion in the seven years between 2014 and 2020.

‘That’s the range that’s being looked at,’ an EU source said. ‘It won’t be far off a 10 per cent increase one way or the other.’

If Mr Barroso opts for the higher 
number, it will mean the amount paid to Brussels by every family in 
Britain will increase from £612 a year to £688 annually.

Over the seven year period of the budget, the total extra cost to British households will be £532.

The Commission plans are still being 
thrashed out, but even the lower figures that are under consideration 
will be fiercely opposed by the Government.

It marks the start of a year of 
horse-trading. Britain cannot veto the plans without support of other EU
 nations, though France and Germany have joined Mr Cameron in calling 
for a real terms freeze.

A Treasury source said: ‘This would be an outrageous demand.

‘It is far too large when we need to see
 restraint. The rebate is not up for negotiation. The case for the 
rebate is as strong as ever.

The Prime Minister held a meeting in Downing Street with Mr Barroso last week and warned him that Britain will not accept a high budget demand at a time when voters are having to ensure a period of austerity at home.

The Commission President made clear that he has to listen to all 27 member states and many want to see spending increase because they receive massive subsidies from rich countries such as the UK.

Since the bailouts paid to Portugal and Ireland are in part underwritten by the EU budget, the prospect of one of them defaulting could lead to further demands for cash.

Mats Persson, director of think-tank Open Europe which wants reform of the EU, said: ‘Any increase above the rate of inflation would clearly be unacceptable, given the continuous austerity around Europe and the exceptionally poor value for taxpayers’ money the EU budget provides.

‘If the increase is anywhere close to the figures being suggested, that would be politically explosive and a major own goal for the Commission.’

Eurosceptics said that on the budget, the EU was running rings around the Government.

Tory MP Douglas Carswell said: ‘These grotesque demands show not just how out of touch the European Commission are, but how they feel they can lord it over us.

‘The Commission can demand ever larger sums of money and, whoever is in government, we don’t seem to have any clout to rein them in.

‘This will fuel the debate about whether we should stay in the EU at all.’

However, there was some good news for the Government when French finance minister Christine Lagarde was named head of the International Monetary Fund. The Chancellor George Osborne was the first to publicly back her.

‘I am deeply honoured by the trust placed in me,’ said Miss Lagarde, whose five-year term begins on July 5.

Chancellor George Osborne said Miss Lagarde’s appointment was ‘good news for the global economy and for Britain’.

While not a trained economist, she has made her mark as the first woman finance minister of a major world economy by surrounding herself with strong advisers and by using her impeccable English and media savvy to get her message out.
