A mother feasted on sponges and sand after developing insatiable cravings for both throughout her pregnancies.

Kelly-Marie Pearce’s strange 20-a-day habit saw her munch her way through thousands of washing-up sponges, washed down with piles of sand when she was pregnant with baby Lola and son Lucian.

But despite her fondness for the bizarre snack - which she would often stack together to make sponge and sand sandwiches -  both her children were born healthy and unharmed.

Mrs Pearce, 28, from Wolverhampton, said: 'It tasted really good at the time.'

'It was really satisfying. It was exactly what I needed. I was getting through bowls and bowls of sand a day. I wasn’t eating anything else but sand and sponges.

'It’s like when you really fancy a bit of chocolate and you finally get a piece and its so satisfying.'

The full-time mum suffered from Pica disorder throughout the pregnancies, which causes victims to crave objects that are not food.

Her unusual cravings started five months into her first pregnancy with Lucian, now four, and were sparked when her mother-in-law was changing the sand in her parrot’s cage.

She explained: 'I kept getting this weird taste in my mouth. I knew I was craving something but could not put my finger on what until I saw the sand and that’s when I knew I wanted it.

'Then when I saw her change the sand in the parrot’s cage I thought "I could just eat that" and I asked her if I could have some and I started eating it. She thought it was mad but let me carry on.'

When sand didn’t hit the spot, she turned to sponges and scoffed her way through packets a day and even combined the two to make sponge sand-wiches.

'I was in the bath one day and I looked at the sponge. It was new and I just started eating it.

'I would have a small bite then chew it for a bit until it went soft. I even dipped them in the sand - it tasted really good,' she added.

The bizarre craving saw her chomp on 5,000 washing-up sponges and sacks of sand while she was expecting. But both her children were born healthy and unharmed

'Then I started eating washing up sponges but ripping the rough side off.

'I went through loads and had to keep buying sand from the pet shop and lots of sponges.

'I could not go anywhere without taking sand or sponges with me. It’s very different to your normal pregnancy cravings.'

The habit of eating non-edible objects could arise from some sort of deficiency.

Some sufferers eat dirt and many of them are found to lack iron, which is present in soil. 

Others develop the condition because of extreme stress, though it is not clear why.

A desire to eat cleaning agents may be linked with obsessive-compulsive disorder or just a liking for fragrances.

Pica can lead to dangerous complications in the body's metabolism.

One type of treatment is cognitive behavioural therapy with an experienced psychologist.

Then when Mrs Pearce fell pregnant again last year with Lola, now seven months old, the crazy cravings returned and she went through the same routine of only eating sand and sponges all over again.

Her husband Damian, 31, was worried her diet was harming his unborn children, but when the midwife told them it was fine, his wife continued.

'I couldn’t stop her then. She was completely addicted,'  he said.

A spokesperson for Beat, the eating disorders charity, said: 'We do on occasion get people coming to us to say they are suffering from this condition. It doesn’t provide any nutritional intake at all and can have long term health implications.

'Particularly when someone is pregnant, it’s important to provide suitable nutrition for them and the growing baby.

'It’s important that any individual has a well-balanced diet and if they are worried that something like this is affecting them they should seek help at the earliest opportunity. 

'It is worth exploring with a good GP to see if there are serious issues that need to be resolved and whether cognitive behavioural therapy might be appropriate. 'We would urge GPs to make themselves more familiar with this condition and other disordered eating patterns so people can get the help they need.

'Obviously the earlier the individual seeks help, the more likely it is that their problem can be overcome.'
