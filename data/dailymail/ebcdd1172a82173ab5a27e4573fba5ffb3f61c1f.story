A passenger found asleep in a parked pickup truck in Florida claims he had no idea that the driver beside him had been fatally shot.

Police were called to Kimberlea Apartments in Lakeside on Sunday morning by a person who believed two people had been shot in a suspicious vehicle parked outside the clubhouse at the complex.

Inside, 22-year-old Tyler McQueen was sitting in the driver's seat and had been fatally shot. Brandon Burkett, 24, was inside McQueen's car asleep.

He had no idea that the shooting had taken place until he was woken up.

Burkett told police he was sleeping and didn't hear the shooting. Authorities said he has been cooperative.

McQueen was pronounced deceased at 8:03 am by EMS and the Medical Examiner will perform an autopsy later this week.

The pickup, a 2011 Chevrolet Silverado, was registered to McQueen.

Authorities are interviewing the passenger and witnesses. No other details were released.
