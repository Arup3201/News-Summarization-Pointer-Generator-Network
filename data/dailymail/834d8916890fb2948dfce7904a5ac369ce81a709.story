It's a side to the Russian president we have never seen before as he strips off his suit and begins dancing around his office after 'annexing Ukraine'.

An actor playing the role of Vladimir Putin is seen flexing his muscles and doing traditional Russian dancing in the teaser trailer for the sequel to a new sci-fi comedy.

The 'villain' in The Coming Race, played by Finnish actor Kari Ketonen, sits in the Moscow Kremlin as he cuts out parts of Europe on the map and sticks them to the side of Russia.

Ketonen then burst out of his suit, and in just his camouflage trousers, jumps onto his desk before engaging in an energetic dance. 

And now fans will have the chance to participate in the production of the comedy sequel after filmmakers released the video of the movie's villian and urged viewers to send a remix.

Producers say it offers people the chance to show through remix art their true feelings about the Russian president. 

Tero Kaukomaa said: 'Putin is a very controversial character. It's interesting to see how many different takes our fans can come up with.'

Director Timo Vuorensola added: 'I got inspired by the myriads of remixed versions of the new Star Wars teaser trailer, and wanted to see and hear what our fans can come up with this material.' 

The best remixes will be collected and released to the hundreds of thousands of fans on Iron Sky's official Facebook page and YouTube account.

The videos are part of the crowd funding campaign that has so far raised over £127,000 for the pre-production phase of Iron Sky The Coming Race on IndieGoGo crowd funding platform.

The full trailer for the second movie has gone viral and already clocked almost a million views. 

Fans are being urged to remix the video and play a part in the production of The Coming Race, out next year
