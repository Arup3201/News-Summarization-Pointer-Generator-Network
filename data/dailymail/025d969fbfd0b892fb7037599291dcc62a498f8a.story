Sergio Aguero’s super strike to make it 1-1 was Manchester City’s first at the Stadium of Light in more than four-and-a-half years. 

The last City player to find the back of the net on Wearside was a certain Adam Johnson, now of Sunderland. 

He curled a delightful equaliser in the final minute of a 1-1 draw in March, 2010. Johnson, though, has failed to hit those heights in red and white and was absent with a knock.

Jack Rodwell, meanwhile, is another former City player who cost the Black Cats £10m. And, like Johnson, he has done little to suggest that was a bad piece of business on City’s behalf.

Connor Wickham enjoys playing against Manchester City. 

He scored twice during April’s 2-2 draw at the Etihad and got the opener. Wickham has been in fine form of late and, with his contract set to expire at the end of the season, goals against the champions are sure to alert clubs on the lookout for what could be next summer’s big bargain.
