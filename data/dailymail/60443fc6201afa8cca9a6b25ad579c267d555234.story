A teenager was tortured to death by his sister and her boyfriend after they accused him of witchcraft, a court was told yesterday.

Kristy Bamu, 15, drowned in the bath of a blood-soaked flat on Christmas Day 2010 after begging to die in a ‘tale of horror’. He suffered 101 separate injuries as he was attacked with weapons including metal poles, pliers, knives, a hammer and heavy ceramic tiles.

His sister Magalie Bamu and her boyfriend Eric Bikubi, both 28, are accused of beating him to death because they believed he had been possessed by evil spirits.

In a ‘staggering act of depravity and cruelty’ they even forced his two brothers and two sisters, aged between 11 and 22, to join in the attacks, the Old Bailey was told.

The two sisters were also badly wounded after being accused of sorcery, black magic and witchcraft. The siblings had been sent from home in Paris by their parents to enjoy a festive break with their sister at her flat in Forest Gate, East London.

But the visit descended into an almost unimaginable nightmare of violence, the jury heard.

Prosecutor Brian Altman QC said the defendants were responsible for ‘unspeakable savagery’ over four days in the locked eighth-floor flat.

Those involved were originally from the Congo where ‘kindoki’ witchcraft pervades society, he said. It exists alongside the Christian church where religious leaders encourage fasting and purifying with water to exorcise spirits from children.

Mr Altman said: ‘We say that was what was practised by these two.

‘If the practice of kindoki is 
dislocated from the supervisory influence of religious leaders, it may 
take on a feral and, indeed, evil character.

‘The defendants were seeking Kristy’s 
deliverance and exorcism through the dealing out of ever-increasingly 
violent punishments.’

Paramedics discovered a scene of 
horror when Bamu dialled 999 and called them to her flat claiming Kristy
 had drowned in the bath.

Bikubi was trying to resuscitate the victim’s lifeless body as his soaking wet siblings screamed hysterically.

Kristy was covered in injuries and 
some of his teeth were missing. He had died from a combination of his 
injuries and drowning. Blood-stained clothes and weapons, including 
metal bars, blood-stained pliers, knives and a chisel lay everywhere.

A French-speaking paramedic managed to coax details from the victim’s 22-year-old sister, Kelly.

Mr Altman said: ‘She said Eric Bikubi 
had beaten her with a metal bar. She went on to explain that over the 
last four days Eric Bikubi had been abusing the 11-year-old sister, 
Kristy and herself.’

Jurors at the Old Bailey heard the teenager was killed because he was suspected of witchcraft

The jury was told the trip for the two
 sisters and two brothers began without incident. But the mood turned 
sour when football coach Bikubi accused Kristy and his two sisters of 
bewitching another child in the family. Despite their denials, he and 
Bamu beat the four of them and refused to let them eat, drink or sleep 
for days as Bikubi shouted ‘who’s controlling you’ at Kristy.

The couple ordered them to pray and chant through the night before joining attacks on Kristy.

At one point Kristy was made to kneel 
on the floor as floor tiles were smashed over his head. His teeth were 
smashed with a hammer and he was made to drink urine.

His sister is accused of egging on her
 boyfriend and joining the barbaric torture when he became tired, 
including one attack in which she used pliers to tear her brother’s ear.

When Kelly was caught only pretending 
to beat her brother, Bikubi forced a lightbulb into her mouth, grabbed 
her round the throat and held a knife to her chest.

When she asked Bamu why she was doing nothing to protect them, she allegedly replied they ‘deserved it’.

‘The children had no option other than to do as they were told or risk the same violence,’ Mr Altman said.

‘As Kristy’s injuries became ever more severe, he pleaded to be allowed to die.’

Dozens of calls were made to the children’s father, Pierre, in Paris, in which the couple claimed the children were sorcerers.

Kristy begged his father to pick him 
up warning that he would be killed but Mr Bamu did not believe his son 
as he regarded Bikubi as ‘pleasant and gentle’.

In the first seven hours of Christmas 
Day at least 45 calls were made to Paris and the parents eventually 
arranged to travel on December 27.

But it was too late. At around noon 
that day Kristy was thrown in the bath. He drowned as he was too badly 
injured to keep his head above water. His brothers and sisters were made
 to get in too and were hosed down as neighbours beat on the door 
because their homes were flooded.

A calm Bikubi even turned away a 
plumber sent by the council to investigate the leak just 20 minutes 
before emergency services were called.

Mr Altman said Kristy had tried to 
escape but it was ‘futile’ as the flat was locked: ‘There was no escape 
for him – or indeed for any of them.’

Bikubi, who is currently in Broadmoor,
 denies murder but admits manslaughter and assault on the grounds he was
 suffering from schizophrenia and was not responsible for his actions. 
Bamu denies murder and assault.

The trial continues.
