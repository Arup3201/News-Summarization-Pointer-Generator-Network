A brave teenager pulled a police officer from a burning squad car - after the sound of the crash interrupted him watching Cops.

Joe Chambers had been catching up on the show at his home in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, when he heard a bang and rushed outside to find the officer trapped and the car going up in flames.

The 17-year-old, who volunteers for his local fire service, reached inside through the window and hauled the dazed policeman out, according to New York Daily News.

The teenager has been dubbed a hero after he stepped in and pulled the unconscious officer from the car

Officer Mark Kimsey, 30, had been responding to a priority call at about 5.30pm on Saturday when a black pickup truck crashed into the side of his vehicle and dented it shut.

He had managed to radio the accident to control but the force of the crash had left him unable to move as he slipped in and out of consciousness.

The high school senior pulled him out - along with neighbour  Dante Johnson - with seconds to spare as the flames engulfed the seat where Officer Kimsey had been sitting.

Within four minutes flames had spread to the whole vehicle.

He told NBC: 'I saw that it was a cop car. Right then I just started sprinting and did what I had to do.' 

'On three, we just yanked. We basically ripped him out of the car,' Mr Chambers told Daily News. 'He was just mumbling in pain. He couldn't feel his legs. He was so in shock, he couldn't move.'

Meanwhile, other bystanders rushed to help the unconscious driver of the pickup truck to safety.

Both drivers were taken to the Hospital of the University of Pennsylvania for treatment where they remain in a stable condition.

Police said that Officer Kimsey suffered trauma to his head when the airbag was deployed and burns to his legs while the 52-year-old pickup driver also had head injuries.

Mr Chambers also sustained minor scrapes and was taken to a nearby children's hospital before later visiting Officer Kimsey at his bedside, where they posed for a picture.

The teenager has since been hailed a hero by the police force.

John Stanford, a Philadelphia Police spokesman, wrote on Twitter: 'A uniform doesn't make a hero, courage and bravery does. A few young men saved a Philly police officer and citizen.'

While the Leedom Fire Company, where he volunteered for three years, wrote on Facebook: 'Leedom fireman Joe Chambers assisted with removing a Philadelphia police officer from his car moments before it caught on fire tonight. 

'Strong work brother! We are all very proud of you! We would like to send our best wishes for a speedy recovery along to the police officer and the passenger of the other vehicle.'

Mr Chambers now plans to join the Marines or Army when he graduates from high school, but would like to become a police officer or firefighter, he told the Daily News.
