The former girlfriend of a Cirque du Soleil dancer on trial for killing another performer has backed his claims that she was jilted and unstable with violent tendencies, describing a previous incident where the alleged victim 'pushed, slapped and spit on' him.

Jason 'Blue' Griffith is accused of choking to death Debbie Flores Narvaez, dismembering her body and hiding it in concrete-filled plastic tubs in an abandoned home. But his attorneys in the explosive murder case say he acted in self-defense when he wrapped his forearms around her until she went limp in December 2010.

On Monday, the eighth day of the Las Vegas trial, 'Zumanity' dancer Agnes Roux told jurors Flores Narvaez had harassed and stalked Griffith and had a history of acting irrationally.

Roux also told of how she called 911 on Griffith's behalf after an incident where Flores Narvaez was in her car chasing Griffith to his property.

According to the Las Vegas Review-Journal, the jury heard 14 911 calls Griffith made himself involving domestic incidents with Flores Narvaez during their volatile year-long relationship.

However, Roux also talked of Griffith's cheating and told the court she refused to get back with him in December 2010 unless he ended his relationship with Flores Narvaez.

'It was quite obvious she couldn't be in the picture if I was back,' Roux said Monday, according to the Review-Journal.

She said she had split with the performer months earlier after discovering the affair, and later learning he was sleeping with two other dancers who he performed with in the Cirque du Soleil show 'Love.'

Roux believed the pair were monogamous until their break up she said, and that he had ended things with Flores Narvaez in May 2010, but testimony shows he continued having sex with the alleged victim for some time.

Roux described an incident in October 2010 when Flores Narvaez allegedly attacked Griffiths in front of her, yelling at him to tell her the truth about their affair. She began to kick Griffith's car door angrily and when Griffith grabbed her by the shoulders she fell to the ground, Roux recalled.

However, Griffith didn't push her down, Roux said.

'Her fall seemed disproportionate' to how he grabbed her, she told jurors.

Griffith was later arrested and charged with coercion in the incident but the charges were dropped.

But during cross-examination, Roux was asked about a note Griffiths told her was from Flores Narvaez, threatening to kill him if he was ever with another woman.

Prosecutor Michelle Fleck asked whether Roux knew that Griffith had learned four years ago that the note was written by his roommate Louis Colombo.

Roux said she didn't know that and looked squarely at Griffith, before telling the court 'I just believe he's a great actor,' with reference to his claims he was suicidal after she dumped him for cheating.Closing arguments in the case should begin Tuesday.

Griffith also resumed the stand on 
Monday and tried to fend off a prosecutor's suggestions that what he 
really did was eliminate a pesky former girlfriend whose pregnancy claim
 endangered his new romance.

'Debbie
 was the obstacle,' prosecutor Marc DiGiacomo said as he questioned the dancer about his motivation in the asphyxiation death.

Griffith,
 35, previously told the jury that he fell back to the floor and held 
Flores Narvaez tightly around the upper chest and neck until she stopped 
breathing. He said he thought she was reaching for a gun in her 
purse. No gun was ever found, and medical examiners found no evidence 
during her autopsy that she was pregnant at the time.

Griffith denied under questioning Monday that he was angry during the argument.

'You weren't enraged?' DiGiacomo asked. 'Was it an accident?'

'In
 fear, sir,' Griffith replied. He said he and Flores Narvaez were close together
 in his home music studio when she hit him in the face as she reached 
past him toward her purse.

'She
 attacked me, sir,' Griffith said. 'I attempted to restrain her so she 
wouldn't hurt me or herself. The only thing I did was restrain her, 
sir.'

Griffith denied 
that Flores Narvaez's claim of pregnancy led to the fight. He had accompanied the woman to an abortion clinic in May 2010, but he also maintained that he
 was never sure she was really pregnant at that time. Afterward, the two
 stopped seeing each other for several weeks.

Jurors
 have been told that after the couple got back together a few weeks 
later, Flores Narvaez slashed three tires on Griffith's car in a fit of anger. 
But they remained intimate in the fall, while Griffith spent time with 
the new girlfriend, Agnes Roux, and continued sleeping with several 
other women.

DiGiacomo
 ended two days of cross-examination questioning Griffith about 
inconsistencies on the whereabouts of Flores Narvaez's cellphone after her death.

Horrific: The dismembered body of dancer Deborah Flores Narvaez was found encased in concrete in 2011

Griffith
 insisted that he didn't take her phone. GPS put the phone at or near 
the New York-New York resort, DiGiacomo said, where Griffith, who danced
 at the time with the Cirque du Soleil show, 'Love,' went to meet Roux, a
 dancer in the Cirque show 'Zumanity.'

Prosecutors
 told jurors that after entombing Flores Narvaez's dismembered body in concrete 
in his home, Griffith spent several nights with Roux at a boutique hotel
 just off the Las Vegas Strip.

Griffith
 is standing trial on a murder charge that could get him life in prison. The dancer's disappearance drew intense media attention after she failed to 
show up for work as a dancer in the racy 'Fantasy' revue at the Luxor 
hotel-casino.

Her remains were found weeks later in two tubs of concrete in a vacant home in downtown Las Vegas.

Griffith
 has testified that he and Flores Narvaez had a violent relationship and that 
she stalked, threatened, harassed and assaulted him when he tried to 
limit their time together.

He
 left the jury with the impression Friday that his roommate, Louis 
Colombo, dismembered Flores Narvaez's body. Her remains were recovered January 8, 
2011, after Colombo received immunity from prosecution and led police to
 them.

Colombo testified last week that Griffith sawed off Flores Narvaez's legs, while Griffith testified that it was Colombo.

Colombo was due to return to the witness stand before Griffith's defense attorneys rest their case, perhaps on Tuesday.

Last week, Griffith cried on the stand as he showed the jury how Flores Narvaez had died in his arms while he was trying to talk to her.

Describing her as violent and possessive, he claimed that the dancer had threatened him and assaulted him.

Griffith told the court no one had taken 
him seriously when he tried to report Flores Narvaez for stalking and 
harassing him after they began a relationship earlier in the year.

On the night that she died, Griffith claimed that he was trying to stop her reaching a purse, which he thought contained a gun.

'I
 think she's reaching for the gun in her purse, but I have no way to 
know. I was telling her to stop. I pull her back toward me,' he said.Â 

Griffith showed the jury how the alleged victim's head had become wedged in his 
elbows as he fell backwards on the floor of his studio apartment.

'She
 says, "I'm going to [expletive] 
kill you. I'm going to [expletive] kill you",' Griffith said, adding 
that she was kicking him with the high heels of her boots and threw her 
head back against his nose as he held her.

Claiming
 that he was pleading with her to stop, Griffith said: 'I thought she 
was listening to me, because she wasn't moving anymore. She wasn't 
scratching me, or gasping for air.'

Moments later, he claimed, he realized she wasn't breathing at all.

Their
 fight had allegedly been because Flores Narvaez wanted him to stop seeing 
another dancer.

He said she had claimed to be pregnant, but a medical 
examiner said there was no evidence to support this.

The
 35-year-old has acknowledged lying to police, and said he hid details 
of the killing from everyone, including his housemate Louis Colombo, who
 testified that he helped dispose of the victim's body.

Griffith has pleaded not guilty 
to first-degree murder, and his defense, Jeff Banks, says the dancer was acting in self-defense.

'They will show you pictures, and they 
will be gruesome and they will be shocking,' Banks said during the opening statements on May 8.

'But that does 
not change the fact ... that he was scared and he was afraid that she 
was violent, and Jason Griffith was defending himself on December 12, 2010.'

The jury has already heard from Flores Narvaez's roommate and fellow Fantasy dancer Sonya Sonnenberg, who testified that on the day of the murder, the woman had gone to Griffith's house to watch Dexter - a TV show about a serial killer - and never returned.

After finding her dismembered body in a vacant house, police finally cracked the disappearance-turned-homicide case when they gave Griffith's housemate, Colombo, immunity from prosecution.

Colombo told police he left the house after seeing Griffith put his hands around Flores Narvaez's neck as they argued. When he returned, he could see she was dead.

A friend, Kalae Casorso, told police that Griffith admitted to her that the woman was in the huge tub of cement he and Colombo tried to store at her house.
