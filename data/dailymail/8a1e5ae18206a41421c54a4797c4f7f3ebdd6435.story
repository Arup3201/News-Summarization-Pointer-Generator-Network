Prosecutors in Mexico are under pressure to drop a probe into a vigilante gunman who shot dead two armed robbers when they climbed aboard the bus he was travelling on.

Heberto Lujan Fuentes has received a massive outpouring of support on Mexican social media with calls for him to be cleared of any charges.

He had joined a gun club and obtained a licence to own a gun after twice being robbed at knifepoint. It is not clear if he also had permission to carry it in public.

Heberto Lujan Fuentes has received a massive outpouring of support on Mexican social media after he shot dead two armed gunmen who were attempting to rob a bus he was traveling on

When the two armed men had attempted to rob bus passengers of their belongings while he was on board, he simply pulled out his gun and shot them both dead.

Mexico has experienced increasingly high crime rates in the last 10 years, especially in major urban centres, and many are fed up with the failure of authorities to crack down on violence.

The incident happened on a bus driving through the Cuauhtemoc borough of Mexico City when the two men boarded the vehicle at a bus stop.

As soon as the doors were closed, the men started brandishing weapons and threatening passengers into handing over their belongings.

Passenger Fuentes, 43, then pulled out his gun and shot both of the robbers, one of whom - a 23-year-old named Ricardo Sevilla Amador - died on the spot. 

His partner, who has not been named but is between 25 and 30 years old, managed to stagger out of the bus but died on the street.

Two other bus passengers were injured in the incident and taken to hospital for treatment, although it is not clear if they were harmed by the thieves or as a result of shots fired by Fuentes.

Police spokesperson Azas Lira Mares said: 'We are investigating the incident to see if any charges should be brought forward although it is likely the passenger will not face prosecution as he appear to have acted in self-defence.' 

The bus attack follows a similar incident in the same area of the city in April of this year when a passenger also killed two robbers who had boarded a bus and were threatening people into handing over their possessions.
