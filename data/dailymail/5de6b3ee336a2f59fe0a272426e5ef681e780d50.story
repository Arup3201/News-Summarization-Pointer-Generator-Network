A six-year-old boy with special needs is being kept off school for his own safety after he suffered badly burned hands and a broken nose in separate accidents.

His mother Elizabeth MacLeod hasn't sent her son Ellis Tattersall to St Clement's School, in Dingwall, since he was burnt on 13 December and claims staff weren't aware of either injury.

Ellis has Angelman Syndrome, which severely affects his intellectual development meaning he has the ability of a 15-month-hold toddler.

Six-year-old Ellis Tattersall's mum claims that he was injured twice in school without any adequate explanation

Ms MacLeod, from Alness. Ross and Cromarty, says Ellis returned in October with a broken nose.

Six weeks later she was called to his class to find him screaming in agony with severely blistered fingers and she rushed him to accident and emergency.

No available places at other special schools means Ellis has been out of education for two months.

Education officials suggesting that Ellis should return to St Clement's butÂ  Ms MacLeod has refused on safety grounds.

Now a half-day slot has been offered to him at a local nursery while he waits for a place at St Duthus School 14 miles away in Tain.

Ms MacLeod took Ellis to the hospital where he had both hands bandaged for the burns

Ms MacLeod questions why the school failed to keep Ellis safe.

She said: 'I would be a terrible mum allowing him to go back there. My job as his mum is to keep him safe.'

'I don't trust them with his safety. I have kept him safe for nearly seven years and I don't understand why they couldn't do that for four months.'

Ellis suffers from developmental delay, a lack of speech, seizures and walking and balance disorders.

He is still in nappies, has little awareness of pain or danger and a growth deficiency means he is the size of a three-year-old.

Ellis started at St Clement's in August and when he came home on October 30 his mum realised immediately that his nose was swollen, red and bruised.

She took him to hospital in Invergordon and was told his nose was broken.

She says St Clement's told her he didn't break his nose there and it was suggested it may have happened on the way home leaving the Mum unhappy with how they had dealt with it.

On December 13 the school called to say Ellis was very distressed at lunchtime.

Ms MacLeod claims that on her arrival at the school she heard Ellis screaming in 'absolute agony'.

His mum asked what was wrong and Ellis put one hand on top of the other on his chest.

She opened his hands to find 'massive' blisters on four fingers and claims she was told they had no idea what had happened.

She took Ellis to hospital again and his hands were bandaged.

During a meeting with the head teacher and through a formal report on the incident, she was told Ellis had pushed his hands into a hot mince pie due to his compulsive desire for food.

The report claims he was happy eating lunch at 12.10pm, but was distressed 10 minutes later.

Ellis burnt his hands by touching piping hot food at school. Ms MacLeod claims she found him screaming in agony clutching his hands to his chest

Ellis's fingers had massive blisters that were only treated when Ms MacLeod took him to accident and emergency

The mum says she got a call at 1.05pm and arrived at 1.20pm when she found the blisters.

Elizabeth was unsatisfied and told the head that Ellis wouldn't be returning to the school as her 'trust in them had gone'.

She said: 'I wasn't happy with him going back to school after what had happened to him in a four-month period.

'He attended nursery for three years and only had one incident, which was explained down to the last second.

'At St Clement's there was no explanation for the broken nose and I was unsatisfied with the explanation of how he burnt his hand.

'I know it's hard to understand a child in four months, but they get paid and trained and it is their job to try to keep him safe.'

Ms Macleod with her son Ellis. the worried mother refuses to allow her son to go back to the school and is still waiting for an alternative placement

Ms Macleod wrote to education officials and during a meeting showed photographs of the injuries.

She has now been told that she could take Ellis to Obsdale nursery in Alness for two-and-a-half hours each day, which she is happy to do.

Council vice-convener Maxine Smith, said: 'It is my understanding that Ellis is being provided for at the same school as his sister in the meantime.

'The problem with the special school in Tain he is best suited to attend is that there is physically not enough room at this time. However, the education department is working on this.

'Regarding the injuries sustained, that sound horrendous. I am waiting for the council to investigate this, which will take some time, and get back to me.'

Despite repeated contacts, no formal comment was available from Highland Council.
