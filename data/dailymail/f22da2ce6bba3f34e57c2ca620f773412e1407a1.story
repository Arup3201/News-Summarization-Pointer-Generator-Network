A great-grandmother who suffered a fractured skull after being beaten as she lay in her own bed died in hospital in the early hours of this morning.

Emma Winnall was found unconscious and covered in blood when carers came to check on her in her home in Birmingham earlier this month.

The 93-year-old died of complications arising from her injuries at 4.30am today, West Midlands Police said.

Attack: Emma Winnall, pictured in a photograph released by her family as she lay ill in hospital, was assaulted as she slept at her home in Moseley, Birmingham, some time between 9pm on April 30 and 9am the next day

Superintendent Richard Baker, Head of Major Crime at West Midlands Police, said: 'This is desperately sad news. Our condolences go out to Emma's family and friends.

'Clearly, this has now become a murder inquiry.'

Re-appealing for information about the offence, he added: 'This was a shocking attack on a defenceless, elderly woman as she slept in her own bed.

'No-one capable of carrying out such a despicable attack deserves protecting - I'm asking people to look into their consciences and if they have any suspicions about who may be responsible to contact police.'

Mrs Winnall had a fractured skull, a broken arm and wrist and a partially severed finger. The beating was so severe that the frail widow's palms were bruised from her attempts to protect herself, while blood had splattered on to the walls behind her bed.

A woman, 56, and a man, 28, were arrested at their home in the Hall Green area of Birmingham on May 17 on suspicion of assault. They were later released on bail until July.

The arrests came after a £5,000 reward was offered today for information leading to a conviction in the case.

Crimestoppers offered the cash reward in a move backed by West Midlands Police.

Detective Chief Inspector Sarb Johal said at the time: 'I would like to thank Crimestoppers for offering this reward and say again that local people hold the key to finding who is responsible for this terrible attack.

'No-one capable of carrying out such a despicable attack deserves protecting.

'I’m asking people to look into their consciences and if they have any suspicions about who may be responsible to contact police.'

A shocking picture released by her family in the days after the attack showed the full extent of the appalling injuries Mrs Winnall suffered to her face.

As her family appealed for help in finding her attacker, they revealed that Mrs Winnall had started to describe the awful moment she was assaulted.  

Her daughter said she spoke of screaming for help in vain, while the palms of her hands are bruised from her attempts to protect herself.  The beating was so severe blood had splattered on to the walls behind her bed.

Mrs Winnall’s daughter Joyce Blencoe, 56, spoke last week from West Midlands Police headquarters with her brother John.

She said: ‘To see your mum viciously beaten and covered in blood has been the most horrific nightmare. It’s broken my heart to hear my frail and defenceless mum manage to say she was screaming for help and no one came.’

Mrs Winnall, who lived in Moseley, Birmingham, worked at the city’s small arms factory during the Second World War. She relied on a wheelchair to get around, and lived alone since her husband Frank died in 2006, aged 91. 

She is survived by five children, seven grandchildren and four great-grandchildren.
