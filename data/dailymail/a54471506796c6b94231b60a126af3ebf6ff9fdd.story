A rare piece of presidential history is sitting in the Arizona desert - and its  new owners didn't know its significance for years.

The first-ever Air Force One, used by Dwight Eisenhower in the 1950s, had been sold to a crop duster who used it for parts. 

It now sits in a field at the Marana Regional Airfield outside Tuscon, where the owners parked it.

The plane  inspired the call sign Air Force One after nearly running into another aircraft over the skies of New York City in 1953.

Columbine II, a plane used by President Dwight Eisenhower in 1953 and 1954, is now sitting in an Arizona field

The interior of the plane used to contain marble floors and a mahogany desk but now needs $200,000 in restoration

The plane is now being degraded by the Arizona sun, and its owners want to sell it for $1.5million to someone who will restore it

The plane, a Lockheed Constellation dubbed Columbine II in honor of Marie Eisenhower's home state Colorado, was used by the 34th president in 1953 and 1954. 

It included the mahogany desk where Eisenhower wrote his Atoms For Peace speech that he gave to the UN General Assembly in 1953, in which he discussed nuclear warfare, according to Fox.

Then president-elect Eisenhower also took the plane on a trip to Korea to meet troops stationed there.

Air Force One was first officially used as a call sign by Columbine III, which was used for most of Eisenhower's presidency.

The plane inspired the Air Force One call sign when it nearly had a mid-air collision above New York City in 1953

The aircraft, a Lockheed Constellation also took the 1950s president to Korea to visit the troops before he formally took office

However, the Columbine II inspired the name after a confusion of call numbers by air traffic control almost caused a mid-air collision between the plane and another aircraft in 1953 above New York.

Columbine I was a plane Eisenhower used in World War II.

The former general's first presidential aircraft, which also had marble floors and sleeping quarters, is the only former Air Force One plane that is not in a museum.

Its current owners are asking $1.5million for the plane, which has been parked in Arizona since 2005.

The airfield makes money by leasing pieces of land.

No hangar protects it from the suns rays, which are gradually breaking down both the exterior and interior. 

Eisenhower's granddaughter Marie Jean is now working with the National Airline Museum in Kansas City to buy it, according to History Net.

Ms Eisenhower, who traveled with her grandfather as a child said: 'As soon as I saw the interior of Columbine II again, the hair on the back of my neck stood up.'

She plans on restoring the plane to the way it was for the president and giving veterans flights to thank them for their service to the country.

Though refurbished by its current owners in the 1990s, the plane is not the same as during its heyday.

'In its glory days it had marbled floors,' Miller said. 'Now it just looks like any old, beat-up aircraft sitting there,' airport manager Steve Miller told the Arizona DailyStar.

After its use for the commander in chief, it became a plane for VIPs such as Eisenhower's vice president Richard Nixon and Queen Elizabeth II.

It was officially retired in 1968. 

Mel Christler bought the plane in 1970, originally intending to use it for crop dusting and fighting forest fires.

He later sold some of its parts after discovering that the landing gear was not right.

Eisenhower reportedly used a desk on the plane to write his Atoms For Peace speech to the UN about nuclear warfare

The airplane used by Eisenhower (right) was bought from the military in 1970 by Mr Christler, who was interested in turning it into a crop duster

It was not until the Smithsonian called in 1980 that Mr Christler knew he had a piece of history.

The businessman and partners restored the plane to flying condition for $150,000 and took it to shows, though multiple attempts at selling have been unsuccessful.

Bids at a 1998 auction were reportedly as high as $1.4million, though the owner did not think they were credible, according to a short history of the aircraft. 

Mr Christler died in 2005, and his partners are looking for someone else to take the plane and restore it, according to their Facebook page.

Restoration will cost an estimated $200,000. 

Bids at a 1998 auction were thought to have reached $1.4million, though the plane was not sold and its owners are still looking for buyers
