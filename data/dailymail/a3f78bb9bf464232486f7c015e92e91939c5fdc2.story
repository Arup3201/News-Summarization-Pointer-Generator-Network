Three generations of the same family killed in an arson attack had a triple funeral service today - with the teenage mother and her young baby in the same coffin.

Kayleigh Buckley, 17, and her daughter Kimberley, six months, died in the blaze along with the baby’s grandmother Kim Buckley, 46.

More than 800 people attended the funeral of the three generations of the same family in Cwmbran, South Wales.

Hundreds of mourners attended the service at St Gabriel's Church in Cwmbran, where the coffin of Kayleigh Buckley was brought in (pictured)

The funeral took place for Kim, Kayleigh and Kimberley Buckley, who all died in a house fire in Cwmbran, south Wales

Relatives said it was fitting that Kayleigh and Kimblerley were laid in the same coffin covered in cream flowers for the service.

The new mum had just celebrated Kimberley’s homecoming from hospital after being born three months prematurely at just 1lb 9ozs when fire ripped through their home.

The tiny baby had been brought home just six hours before the blaze began.

Kayleigh visited her surviving baby every day in hospital for five months until the child  was allowed out for the first time.

In a Facebook message last week Kayleigh said: 'She is 11lbs 3oz. Getting excited now. Could be home soon but not saying until she is home. Don’t want to jinx it.'

Congratulations banners were hung from the family home and there was a little party for family and friends on Monday night when they finally brought Kayleigh home.

The house was set on fire around 3am the next morning as the family slept.

People nearby heard Kayleigh screaming: ‘Help, us, help us’ as the fire ripped through the family home. Firefighters found their bodies shortly afterwards.

The funeral was attended by firefighters who battled to save the family when the flames tore through their home last month.

Police investigating the deaths were also at the service at St Gabriel’s Church in Cwmbran.

Afterwards the cremation took place at Gwent Crematorium.

Many of the mourners wore red in honour of soccer fan Kim’s love of Liverpool.

Father Michael Phillips, Rector of Cwmbran, told the mourners: 'We simply cannot believe what has happened - it was all so sudden.

'Our hearts are filled with justifiable anger and with questions as to why.

The Right Reverend Dominic Walker, Bishop of Monmouth, added: 'Kayleigh was a shy, but loving girl, who together with her mum was overjoyed to become a mum herself.

'Her baby Kimberly fought bravely for many months until strong enough to come home to a house filled with balloons.

'Within hours it all, through the fire, ended in tragedy.'

The service sung a number of hymns including Abide With Me, Love Divine, Guide me O Thou Great Redeemer, All Things Bright and Beautiful.

The family asked for donations to be sent to the Special Care Baby Unit at the Royal Gwent Hospital were Kayleigh gave birth to little Kimberley.

Kayleigh’s ex-boyfriend Carl Mills, 28, has been charged with their murder and will appear in court in December.
