American families may soon be using waterless toilets and recycling their urine, according to new research.

Chemical engineers at the University of Florida have been looking at ways to extract phosphorus - a life-sustaining element - from urine, before it enters the sewage system and becomes diluted.

Since estimates suggest that phosphorous - which occurs as phosphate rocks and is mined for crop fertilizer - could be exhausted in the next 50 to 100 years, urine recycling may be the key to conserving the non-renewable resource in the future.

Natural resource: Scientists at the University of Florida say waterless toilets, which make it easier for life-sustaining element phosphorus to be extracted from urine - may be installed in U.S. homes in the future

Phosphorus, an element we take into our bodies in the form of phosphates from foods like bran, cheese and nuts, is essential for human health, 
especially for bones and teeth.

According to Healthaliciousness.com, a phosphorus deficiency can lead to lost appetite, anemia, muscle pain, rickets and a weakened immune system.

But with the extensive mining of phosphate rocks for crop fertilizer, it risks becoming scarce in the near future - an issue the scientists at the University of Florida sought to address in their research.

Under lab conditions, the researchers were able to successfully extract about 97per cent of the phosphates in urine within five minutes.

They achieved the extraction with a scientific technique called ion-exchange using HAIX resin, which may form the basis of systems to be installed in U.S. homes in the future.

David Brown, chief executive of the Institution of Chemical Engineers, said of the findings: 'Our attitude and whole approach to recycling will need to change as we come under increasing pressure to conserve valuable, non-renewable resources like Phosphorus.

'The research is another great example of chemical engineers providing alternative approaches and solutions to the creation of more sustainable approaches to issues like waste water management and recycling.'

If urine-extracting toilets actually came into use, it wouldn't be the first time we have utilized our bodily functions in such a way.

According to ABC.net, ancient cultures in Greece and Asia commonly used their own urine to provide nutrients to fertilize crops.

And in parts of Europe, phosphate extraction from human urine is already underway.

In 2002, the tiny Swedish town of Tanum launched an initiative requiring homes to only have 'urine-separating' toilets, to help combat the future global shortage of phosphorus.

Phosphorus, which occurs naturally and is mined from phosphate rocks for crop fertilizer, may run out in the next 50 to 100 years

Urine also contains a high level of phosphorus

Introducing waterless toilets, so that phosphates may be more easily extracted from urine, may be the key to saving this non-renewable resource
