England's plans to field an unchanged team against South Africa on Saturday were shattered by another injury setback on Tuesday night — leaving Anthony Watson poised to replace fellow Bath wing Semesa Rokoduguni.

Having revealed at lunchtime that Rokoduguni trained fully in the morning, hours later the national coaches were forced to rule him out of the QBE Test at Twickenham. The Fiji-born soldier suffered a thigh injury in the 24-21 defeat against New Zealand last weekend.

In response to the unwelcome development, England retained Marland Yarde in their squad to play the world’s No 2-ranked side. However, Watson — who made his Test debut off the bench against New Zealand — is set to start on the right flank; having long been identified by Stuart Lancaster as a player of star potential.

Head coach Lancaster said: ‘Roko did some limited training but is unlikely to fully recover from his thigh injury in time for the game so Marland is in the group.’

There are also concerns about Northampton flanker Tom Wood, which has led to Wasps captain James Haskell being kept on standby.

Lancaster added: ‘Tom is still sore from the weekend and sat out training so we are including five back rows to give us options.’

Wood will be given every chance to prove he is fit to face the Boks, as part of the same pack which started the match against the world champions four days ago.

Sportsmail understands Lancaster and his coaches had resolved to field an unchanged team, having decided that a fifth successive loss against the peerless Kiwis is no cause for panic.

Having identified the need to generate attacking fluency and cohesion, Lancaster, Andy Farrell, Graham Rowntree and Mike Catt wanted to give the same line-up another chance.

That ambition was dashed by Rokoduguni’s thigh problem, but earlier there had been better news. Bath centre Kyle Eastmond returned to training after illness, thus delaying the prospect of George Ford and Owen Farrell being reunited as a 10-12 axis which proved mighty effective at age-group level.

Northampton forwards Dylan Hartley and Courtney Lawes are expected to be passed fit, despite both suffering concussion last weekend.

As ever, midfield remains a focus for debate.

The possibility of a Ford-Farrell alliance came to the fore due to England’s kicking deficiencies against the All Blacks.

However, the latest centre partnership — the 10th employed under Lancaster; Eastmond and Brad Barritt — acquitted themselves well with a limited supply of prime possession.

But the injury to Rokoduguni means changes will be made for the game against the number two ranked side

Catt is well versed in the perennial English search for the most effective double-act in the 12 and 13 shirts, having been involved in it as a player and now as a coach.

On Tuesday, he said: ‘I think it worked very well at the weekend. From a defensive point of view we were very solid and from an attacking one, we were very limited by what we got.

‘But we saw what Kyle could do in the first Test in New Zealand when we got front-foot ball — the right type of ball. Kyle and Brad are on top of their game. You have got two guys that are massively confident at the moment.

‘Kyle is doing all right with Owen and we expect a big performance this weekend, too.’

Catt also acknowledged the need for midfield continuity, which has often been an elusive target due to disruptive injuries.

At present, Manu Tuilagi and Luther Burrell are out of the selection equation but Catt knows England need to stick, rather than keep twisting. ‘There is good competition in those areas but it is about consistency,’ said the World Cup-winner.

‘At the end of the day you want a good established 12 and 13 who can do a job for you. You want to get the combinations right.

South Africa hope to make up for defeat in Dublin by making England suffer at Twickenham on Saturday. John McFarland, South Africa’s assistant coach, says the Springboks believe holding England to 15 points or less will provide a platform for victory. He said: ‘If you concede less than 15, you have a good chance of winning Test matches, but we know we’ve got big improvements to make.’

‘Luther and Billy Twelvetrees did exceptionally well in the Six Nations. Luther is injured now and Kyle has had a fantastic start to the season, so he deserves his shot. Brad has been exceptional for Saracens yet again and he deserves a shot.’

Barritt has often been classified as a wonderfully effective defensive centre without any positive credentials as an attacking force.

But it was his fine pass which teed up Jonny May’s early try against New Zealand and Catt added: ‘Brad does the simple things very well.

‘He carries the ball well and what he brings to the team is what you don’t see. It is how he makes the team feel.

‘He is one of the leaders. He is composed, he gives the guys solutions on the pitch and everybody feels very comfortable with him around.’

England are on high alert about the prospect of facing a Springbok side who are reeling from their emphatic defeat against the Irish in Dublin last Saturday.

Catt spoke about the need to ‘stop the big green machine rolling’ and added: ‘We know what is coming.’
