As electricity returns and highways reopen, some Northeast residents are getting back to their weekday routines following the massive snowstorm that had millions digging out from New York to Maine.

But the routine for other New Englanders will be disrupted by school and workplace closings. For some there's also a new worry: the danger of roof collapses as rain and warmer weather melts snow.

The storm that slammed into the region with up to 3 feet of snow was blamed for at least 15 deaths in the Northeast and Canada, and brought some of the highest accumulations ever recorded. Still, coastal areas were largely spared catastrophic damage despite being lashed by strong waves and hurricane-force wind gusts at the height of the storm.

Hundreds of people, their homes without heat or electricity, were forced to take refuge in emergency shelters set up in schools or other places. But by early Monday, outages had dropped to 149,970 — more than 126,000 of them in Massachusetts.

'For all the complaining everyone does, people really came through,' said Rich Dinsmore, 65, of Newport, R.I., who was staying at a Red Cross shelter set up in a middle school in Middletown after the power went out in his home on Friday.

Dinsmore, who has emphysema, was first brought by ambulance to a hospital after the medical equipment he relies on failed when the power went out and he had difficulty breathing.

'The police, the fire department, the state, the Red Cross, the volunteers, it really worked well,' said the retired radio broadcaster and Army veteran.

Taking it slowly: A car pulls out of a drive in Long Island on Monday as skies remain grey and snow is piled high on the sides of the road

Driving bans were lifted and flights resumed at major airports in the region that had closed during the storm, though many flights were still canceled Sunday. Public transit schedules were being restored.

The Boston-area public transportation system, which shut down on Friday afternoon, resumed full service on Monday - but told commuters to expect delays. The Metro-North Railroad resumed most train service on its New York and Connecticut routes while the Long Island Rail Road said commuters could expect a nearly normal schedule.

'A lot of progress has been made,' said Salvatore Arena, a spokesman for the Metropolitan Transportation Authority, which operates Metro-North.

Some public schools canceled classes 
on Monday, including in Boston, Providence and on Long Island, while 
local governments in some areas told non-essential workers to take the 
day off.

On eastern 
Long Island, the harrowing images from New York's slice of the massive 
snowstorm - people stranded overnight, cars abandoned on long stretches 
of drift-covered highways - were slowly erased Sunday as hundreds of 
snowplows and heavy equipment descended to try to help clear the way for
 Monday's commute.

Long Island was slammed with as much as 30 inches of snow, which shut down roads, including the Long Island Expressway. A 27-mile stretch of the road was closed Sunday and but the roadway reopened Monday in time for the morning commute.

Gov. Andrew Cuomo said more than a third of all the state's snow-removal equipment was sent to the area, including more than 400 plow trucks and more than 100 snowblowers, loaders and backhoes.

'The massive amount of snow left behind effectively shut down the entire region,' Cuomo said.

On
 Sunrise Highway, which runs parallel to the Long Island Expressway, 
Dennis Lawrence, of Bellport, N.Y., had already spent 90 minutes digging
 out the car he had abandoned and had at least another 30-60 minutes to 
go on Sunday. He left it there Friday after getting stuck on his way 
home from his job in New York City.

'The
 car was all over the place, it just slid over and wouldn't move,' the 
54-year-old elevator mechanic said. 'I finally decided today to come and
 get it.'

The thaw has begun but there's lots of snow left. These cars remain buried in Hamden, Connecticut on Sunday

Utility crews, some brought in from as far away as Georgia, Oklahoma and Quebec, raced to restore power. By early Monday, less than 150,000 customers still had no electricity - down from 650,000 in eight states at the height of the storm. In hardest-hit Massachusetts, officials said some of the outages might linger until Tuesday.

Boston recorded 24.9 inches of snow, 
making it the fifth-largest storm in the city since records were kept. 
The city was appealing to the state and private contractors for more 
front-end loaders and other heavy equipment to clear snow piles that 
were clogging residential streets.

The
 National Weather Service was forecasting rain and warmer temperatures 
in the region on Monday - which could begin melting some snow but also 
add considerable weight to snow already piled on roofs, posing the 
danger of collapse. Of greatest concern were flat or gently-sloped roofs
 and officials said people should try to clear them - but only if they 
could do so safely.

'We
 don't recommend that people, unless they're young and experienced, go 
up on roofs,' said Peter Judge, spokesman for the Massachusetts 
Emergency Management Agency.

In Middlefield, Conn., two cows were killed when the roof of a barn gave way under the weight of heavy snow - one of two such incidents in the state that prompted agriculture officials to issue an advisory to farmers.

Officials also continued to warn of carbon monoxide dangers in the wake of the storm.

In
 Boston, two people died Saturday after being overcome by carbon 
monoxide while sitting in running cars, including a teenager who went 
into the family car to stay warm while his father shoveled snow. The 
boy's name was not made public. In a third incident, two children were 
hospitalized but expected to recover. In Webster, a 60-year-old off-duty
 member of the Worcester Fire Department died Saturday after suffering a
 heart attack while clearing snow at his home.

A fire department spokesman said in each case, the tailpipes of the cars were clogged by snow.

In Maine, the Penobscot County Sheriff's office said it recovered the body of a 75-year-old man who died after the pickup he was driving struck a tree and plunged into the Penobscot River during the storm. Investigators said Gerald Crommett apparently became disoriented while driving in the blinding snow.

Christopher Mahood, 23, of Germantown, N.Y., died after his tractor went off his driveway while he was plowing snow Friday night and rolled down a 15-foot embankment.

In Massachusetts, eight teams were formed to assess damage from flooding along the state's coastline, with the hardest hit-areas including historic Plymouth and portions of Cape Cod.

'Considering the severity of the storm, the amount of snow and the wind, we've come through this pretty well,' Gov. Deval Patrick told CBS's Face The Nation after meeting with local officials in Plymouth.

The U.S. Postal Service said that mail delivery that was suspended in the six New England states, as well as parts of New York and New Jersey, because of the snowstorm would resume Monday, where it is safe to do so.
