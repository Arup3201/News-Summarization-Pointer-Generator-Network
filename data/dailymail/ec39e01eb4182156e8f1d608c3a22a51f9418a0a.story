A mother-of-two nearly lost her life during the morning school run, when a 10kg wrecking ball smashed through her windscreen while she was doing 110 km/h on the motorway.

Melissa Woods had just dropped her children at school on the Gold Coast in southeast Queensland and was returning home on the M1 motorway when a wrecking ball detached from the car in front of her and 'shot like a missile' through her windscreen.

Luckily for Mrs Woods, the ball crashed through the passenger side of the car, where one of her children had been sitting only moments before.

'There was a God almighty crash and the windscreen smashed. It was very, very scary,' Mrs Woods said.

'It wasn't until I stopped the car that that it really hit me. What if my kids had been in the car? What if I had been hit?'

Melissa Woods was driving home after dropping her two children at school, when a 10 kilogram towball smashed through her windscreen after detaching from the car in front of her.

Driving 110km/hr on the M1, the 10 kilogram was like a ''missile' and it is 'absolute luck' that no one was injured

No-one stopped to assist Mrs Woods after the incident.

Local police initially did not plan investigating the incident, but Mr and Mrs Woods were told on Thursday morning that a formal investigation would take place.

Police will use CCTV footage that captured the incident, which was taken from a camera on an overpass over the M1.

Melissa Woods' husband, Peter, is disappointed that police were disinterested in the case, for the sake of motorists' safety.

‘In the interest of public safety it needs to be properly investigated. Policing shouldn’t be purely reactive. Full investigations shouldn’t only occur when there has been death or serious injury,' he said.

'Why was he or she driving on a major highway with a towball and assembly that wasn't properly affixed to the car?

'There needs to be a message sent out to road users to take greater responsibility for your vehicle and what is attached to it.'

The offending towball and assembly, which left shards of glass all over the car, smashing through the car's rear seats before bouncing off the back of the car.

When the towball smashed through the front windscreen, the car was showered with shards of glass and Mrs Woods sustained cuts to her hands and face.

Mr Woods is so grateful that his wife was not harmed, but knows that road incidents are all-too-common.

'It's so hard to process it all. If the towball had been just centimetres to the side, my wife would have been decapitated. Had either of my children been in the passenger seat, they would have died. My wife had just dropped them off at school.'

Mrs Woods is relieved the family's beloved dog, Daisy, was not harmed. Daisy was sitting on the passenger seat.

The family's beloved dog, Daisy, was on the passenger seat when the accident happened. She was not harmed.

Melissa Woods' son and daughter would have lost their lives if they had been in the car - but Mrs Woods had just dropped them off at school moments before the accident

'But we need to take incidents like this seriously, to make a statement about negligent behavior from motorists, so it doesn't cause serious injuries on the road.'

'To not have a tow ball properly fastened while driving on a major highway is criminally negligent and ought to be fully investigated by police with appropriate action taken against the owner of the offending vehicle.

The heavy, metal towball ricocheted off the back of the car, before landing next to Mrs Wood in the driver's seat

Mrs Woods described the 'explosion' as terrifying
