A groom played the ultimate prank on his unsuspecting bride as he threw her up in the air for a fun wedding photo - and then dropped her into the freezing cold North Sea.

Richard Hay, 33, decided to throw his bride Lysa up in the air during a post-wedding photo shoot at South Beach, Whitley Bay, Tyne and Wear.

But instead of catching her, the cheeky groom - who is lucky to still be married - took a step back to let her fall into the freezing cold water as family and friends watched on.

An American tradition called 'trashing the dress' has become hugely popular in recent years with brides dreaming up ever more extreme ways to destroy their wedding gowns.

But Lysa, 39, had no idea what her husband intended to do - and ended up wearing a wedding gown that turned see-through when damp in front of her nearest and dearest.

She said: 'It was lovely on the beach and all our friends and family came down, there were even crowds of people watching and we had a picnic.

'When Richard threw me in the air I thought he would catch me, I didn’t think I would go straight under the water.

'I must have swallowed about three mouthfuls of sea water. I was choking and bringing up horrible water.

Unexpected: Mrs Hay's wedding dress went see-through after getting wet in the sea

'To
 be honest the worst thing about it, and I didn’t realise until 
afterwards, the dress went completely see-through as well. Beached whale
 I think was the comment I got not long afterwards.

But fortunately for Mr Hay, his new wife took it all in her stride and is delighted with the unusual wedding celebration footage and photos.

She said: 'With wedding dresses, people wrap them up, they put them in the loft, and they never get used again whereas looking at it now we are fortunate to have fantastic photos and something quite unusual. It was worth it for that.'

Lysa added that she wasn’t surprised by the prank played by her husband who has a reputation for being a joker.

Lysa said: 'He’s always at it. When he went on holiday he filled his friends’ suncream bottles with toothpaste.

'I will get him back though, I don’t know how or when, but I will get him back.'

Mr Hay added: 'I took the opportunity
 to give her the dunking of her life. Watching everyone’s reactions was 
quite satisfying. It was like winning the FA Cup. The highlight of the 
year.'

And the mother-of-three said her husband's prank fitted in with the atmosphere of 'unusual' ceremony.

She
 said: 'For the wedding it was quite unusual, I had Tom Jones ‘She’s a 
Lady’ playing when I walked down the aisle. Richard and I decided to 
chose our own readings.

'We chose a reading each for our friends to read out as part of the ceremony and neither of us knew what each other had chosen. Unbeknown to him I wrote mine myself and called them ‘50 Shades of Hay’.

The couple married on July 14 and are now hoping to plan their first holiday as a family with children Ollie, 11, Marnie, 10, who Richard is step-dad to, and with their youngest Eli, aged three.
