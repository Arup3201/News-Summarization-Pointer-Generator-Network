This was the moment armed police surrounded a suspected gunman next to a children's playground.

Half a dozen officers wielding Heckler & Koch submachine guns swooped on the bare-chested man in an Exeter park while members of the public enjoying the hottest day of the year were kept back from the scene.

After an hour-long stand-off, the man gave himself up and lay face down on the ground as he waited to be handcuffed.

One witness told the Exeter Express & Echo: 'Itâ€™s the sort of incident that happens once in a blue moon around here.'
