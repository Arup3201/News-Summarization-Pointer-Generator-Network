Argentina's President Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner became the godmother of a lesbian couple's baby girl in a Roman Catholic ceremony on Saturday - though the Church opposes gay marriage.

Baby Umma Azul is just over 2 months old and was baptized as mothers Carina Villarroel and Soledad Ortiz, who were married last year, looked on. She's the first child known to receive this church blessing in Argentina.

The ceremony took place in the Cathedral of Cordoba and was officiated by Father Carlos Varas, Reuters reports. The city is located 435 miles from the capital.

'Father Varas told us he had been waiting for a couple like us, a gay one, and we happened to come and he accepted us,' Villaroel told the news agency. 'There's really been a social change for Catholicism to have said yes to baptizing a child from a lesbian family.'

Fernandez de Kirchner won a political
 battle against Pope Francis in 2010 when he was Argentinaâ€™s top 
church leader and the country became the first in Latin America to 
legalize gay marriage.

After he became pope last year, 
Francis showed more openness to gays and lesbians, famously asking, 'Who
 am I to judge?' if a gay person seeks the Lord.

But
 gays were celebrating the move anyway on Friday, saying it suggests a 
new opening for the global church now led by their Argentine pope.

The Vatican considers marriage only to exist between a man and a woman, Reuters notes, and says only children born from wedlock may be baptized by the Church. Pope Francis, however, has said that all children may receive the rite.

It is unclear if the Vatican approved Umma Azul's baptism.

An Argentine law based on an old Russian tradition allows couples to ask presidents to be godparents for their seventh child.

Nancy
 Esteche, who runs the presidential office that arranges these baptisms,
 confirmed on Friday that Fernandez de Kirchner agreed to make an 
exception for the couple's first child.

BBC reports that Fernandez de Kirchner did not attend the ceremony and sent a representative instead.

The
 child's biological mother is Ortiz. Villaroel told Reuters that she was
 fired from her job as a police officer after she requested maternity 
leave.
