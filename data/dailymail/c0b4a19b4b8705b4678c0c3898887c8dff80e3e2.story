Jane O'Brien, 36, from Ruislip who scooped a million pounds lottery win after finding a forgotten EuroMilions ticket in her handbag

Jane O’Brien was a millionaire for three months before realising it after carrying around a jackpot lottery ticket in her handbag.

It wasn’t until 12 weeks after buying the winning EuroMillions raffle ticket that the 36-year-old checked it over breakfast - and discovered she was suddenly very wealthy.

The Transport for London traffic operator from Ruislip, Middlesex, left the cool million unclaimed for more than three months following the May 10 draw - and could have missed the 180-day deadline for claiming prizes had she not cleared out her bag.

She was dumping old paperwork from her handbag when she came across the ticket.

As she checked the results online, Miss O'Brien realised her lucky dip ticket had matched the Millionaire Raffle prize.

'I must have then checked it so many times. It got to the point where I had my finger on the PC checking it one digit at a time,' said Jane as she celebrated with a glass of Champagne.

'There was a number on the back of the ticket and I called it and said: "I hope I’m not wasting your time but I think I’ve won a million pounds.

'Then the lady said: "It’s okay, you can scream now."’

'I was jumping up and down in my kitchen like a mad woman - God knows what the neighbours thought.'

Clutching her beloved handbag, she added: 'This is my lucky bag.

'She’s quite tatty and has been through the wars but she comes everywhere.'

Before the win, thrifty Jane had been working double-shifts to pay for a planned trip to New York in November - blissfully unaware a £1million prize was sitting in her handbag

Before the win, thrifty Jane had been working double-shifts to pay for a planned trip to New York in November - blissfully unaware a neat £1m pounds prize was sitting in her handbag.

She said: 'Fifth Avenue is going to know I’ve been there.

'I’ve been working double shifts to pay for this holiday and all the time I’ve had the ticket in my bag.'

After finding out about her winnings Jane celebrated with parents Eddie and Brenda, who will join her and other relatives on a luxury Caribbean cruise thanks to the huge windfall.

Jane also plans to move out of her rented flat and buy her own home with the cash having spent hours planning what she would do if she ever won big.

'It has always been a dream for me and my mum to live next-door so if I can live next-door to her or find somewhere we can do it that would be great,' she said.

She plans to continue playing the lottery and also has no plans to give up work following the win

'I’m one of those people who is always day-dreaming.

'In work I’m the worst person to be stuck on a late shift with - the conversation always comes around to "what would you do for the EuroMillions or a million pounds?"

'Literally there has not been anything anybody has given me so far that I would not do for a million pounds.

'They are going to really smile at work when they hear I’ve won.'

Keen lottery player Jane picked up her winning ticket as a lucky dip at a local newsagent, though she also plays online and as part of a work syndicate.

She plans to continue playing the lottery and also has no plans to give up work following the win.

'I will keep playing, I reckon I can easily spend a million,' she said.
