British number one Heather Watson suffered a first-round exit at the Citi Open in Washington DC as she lost in three sets to Kirsten Flipkens.

In a topsy-turvy contest, Watson lost the first set 6-3 but came roaring back to take the second 6-1 and the match to a decider.

The final set went to a tie-break and it
 was Belgian Flipkens, ranked nine places higher than Watson at 47 in 
the world, who claimed it 7-6 (7/3) to seal victory in two hours and one
 minute.

Flipkens will face Svetlana Kuznetsova in the second round.

It comes after Watson teamed up with Russia's Alexandra Panova to win the women's doubles title at the Baku Cup in Azerbaijan days before.

The
 British No 1 lost her opening singles match but finished on a 
winning note in the tournament as she and Panova defeated third seeds Raluca Olaru and 
Shahar Peer 6-2 7-6 (7/3), saving two set points in the second set.

Success: Watson claimed her fourth WTA Title by winning the Baku Cup doubles tournament in Azerbaijan
