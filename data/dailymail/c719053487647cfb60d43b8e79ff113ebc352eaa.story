A public servant employed to tackle lobbying reform has stepped down after she tweeted she hoped a campaign group 'would die'.

In comments that are deeply inappropriate for a senior civil servant Eirian Walsh Atkins posted 'I wish unlock Democracy would die. I am prepared to help it along.'

According to the Sunday Times Cabinet Office official Walsh Atkins also posted a string of tweets attacking 'bloody rude Americans' and 'moronic tourists' and now faces an internal investigation into possible breaches of the civil service code of conduct.

Investigation: An internal investigation is set to happen at the Cabinet Offices in Whitehall, where Walsh Atkins had been working before her Twitter outbursts

The comments, which can longer be viewed after she closed down her Twitter account, came amidst claims she had struck 'a cosy relationship with the lobbying industry' and was shunning campaigners.

Unlock Democracy, a campaign for constitutional reform in the UK, today tweeted a response to her outburst saying 'Whitehall’s cosy relationship with the lobbying industry needs to die'  and 'tweets don't bother us but close government links with lobbyists do.'

Director of the campaign group, Peter Facey, said 'As an organisation we have not pursued any disciplinary action over this incident and, following the receipt of an apology from Ms Walsh Atkins, consider the matter closed.

'We would hardly be doing our job properly if we didn’t make an impression on civil servants.'

'If
 yet another Twitter gaffe is not worth worrying about, however, the 
close ties with civil servants and the lobbying industry most definitely
 is.

'Cabinet Office staff have met with the 
UK Public Affairs Council, one of the trade bodies of the lobbying 
industry, at least four times since September 2010 and yet have ignored 
the requests of Unlock Democracy for similar talks.

'None of this will be addressed by a single civil servant losing her post.'

What a twit: Cabinet Office official Eirian Walsh Atkins has stepped down after her inappropriate comments on social network site Twitter

Walsh Atkins had been responsible for preparing the government's consultation proposal for a register for lobbyists and had led the Cabinet Office's refusal to disclose contact with the lobbying industry, under the Freedom of Information Act.

In a statement released to the Sunday Time the Cabinet Office said 'The official has personally apologised without reservation.

'The comments were obviously unacceptable and in no way reflect the views of the Cabinet Office or the government.'

They added that Walsh Atkins will remain employed at the Cabinet Office in a different post until investigations into her outbursts are concluded.
