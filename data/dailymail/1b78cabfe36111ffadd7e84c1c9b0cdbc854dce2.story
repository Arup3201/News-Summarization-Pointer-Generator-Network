A man warned he would die if he attempted to climb Mount Everest has told how he defied medical advice because of a promise he made to himself when he was just 13 and confined to a wheelchair.

That one day he would reach 'the top of the world'.

Three months ago Multiple Sclerosis sufferer Bobby Bajram, 47, returned from the Everest Region of Nepal.

Back home in Melbourne after his incredible expedition to Everest, which was thwarted by a huge avalanche, he is in pain and in and out of hospital having lost the use of his left eye and his legs.

But Bobby's current pain is nothing he hasn’t felt before. At the age of 13 he became the youngest Australian male to be diagnosed with MS. He spent fifteen years in a wheelchair and five years completely blind.

He still suffers excruciating pain every day and during MS attacks half of his body often becomes paralysed. ‘It feels like a hangover, times 100,’ Bobby told Daily Mail Australia.

'Every day you are weighed down like you are walking through mud, that’s how I train and that’s how I have lived for 34 years,' he explained.

Bobby feels lucky that he ‘was born with a jovial positive attitude’, which he credits for allowing him to continue and pursue his Everest dreams despite his all too often health setbacks.

‘It’s just random. I don’t know when it’s going to happen. My body just goes bang.’

When he was first diagnosed with the debilitating disease he promised himself he would ‘walk to the top of world and see blue sky’ and now that’s exactly what he’s doing.

Four years ago Bobby began intense training for his Everest mission.

Bobby was diagnosed with severe MS at the age of 13 and spent 15 years in a wheelchair. This (right) is one of the only photos Bobby has of the years that he was wheelchair bound and blind as he told his mother he did not want any reminders of that time, he is pictured at his friend's wedding in the 1980s

With the help of one of his many sponsors, gym chain Fitness First, Bobby transformed his body to that of an athlete’s.

He exercised for a staggering five-hours a day and went from weighing 148kg to 83kg.

‘I was in the gym for two hours doing squats and leg presses. Then I'd go to a climbing room and walk for 15k in a climate that mimicked being at about 15,000 feet,’ he explained. 

He continued to train despite his doctor Helmut Butzkueven writing in a letter on 31 May 2013: ‘I am extremely concerned about his and his trainer's health climbing Mt Everest and the likely fatal outcome of such a venture.’

‘The doctor said ‘you are too sick, you are the sickest guy in the world with MS’. He said ‘what are you are you doing? You will die in Everest’, Bobby said.

Because of his doctor’s letter nobody would ensure him to go on the trip. That was until he met the chairman of Aon insurance who Bobby said believed in his fundraising mission and sponsored him for half a million dollars.

Bobby began intense training for his Everest mission four years ago, determined to fulfill a promise he set himself when he was 13

When Bobby set off for his first attempt at the life-changing Mount Everest climb on 22 April this year recent tragic events on the mountain made the climb impossible.

‘16 mountain Sherpas were killed ahead of the upcoming climbing season,’ he said.

On 18 April 2014, an avalanche on Mount Everest near Everest Base Camp killed sixteen Nepalese guides.

Thirteen bodies were recovered but the search for the three remaining bodies was called off due to the difficulty and risk of retrieving them.

On 22 April, the Sherpas announced they would not work on Everest for the remainder of 2014 as a mark of respect for the victims.

Instead of returning home, Bobby and his team decided to climb 5550 metres to the peak of the neighbouring mountain, Kala Patthar.

Bobby's doctor wrote a letter warning of a 'likely fatal outcome' if he climbed Mount Everest

While he was in the Himalayas Bobby visited schools, hospitals and donated money to a little girl with a brain tumour to help save her life.

‘That’s what I’m about,’ Bobby said matter-of-factly.

But what Bobby’s pictures from the expedition don’t show is the pain he was in or the fact that he fell over 119 times.

‘The problem with me is when I get sick, I get sick for a long time. I take one step forward and two steps back. I really have to push it to do it,’ he said.

Bobby was hospitalised while in the Himalayas but continued to Trek as soon as he could walk again.

‘I wasn't well but I walked out the hospital there because I said “I am here to peak Kala Patthar. If I can't physically move then we will abandon the trek but as long as I can drag my feet around I am carrying on”.’

Asked whether people treat him differently when he looks healthy from when he is wheelchair bound, Bobby said: ‘I get a lot of people who are very sympathetic to me when I am with my wheelchair or sticks but when I look healthy I don't get the same treatment.’

Despite the fact he is in pain and in and out of hospital since his return from the Himalayas in May, Bobby is determined to go back and climb Everest.

‘I am going to Mera Peak in November, which is next to Everest and about six and a half thousand metres,’ he said.

‘My trainer said “let’s have a look at that and see how you up there and then if you smash that we will go to Everest in 2015”.’

People may wonder why Bobby, who has a five-year-old daughter, continues to strive towards climbing Everest. A mountain where 200 people have died since mountaineers first began to scale it in 1921.

‘I'm an ambassador people with disabilities... I'm the only guy in the world in this situation and no one has done this… I want to raise 100,000 million dollars for people with disabilities around the world,’ Bobby said.

To him, nothing is impossible.

'The doctors say for some unknown reason I just keep going.'
