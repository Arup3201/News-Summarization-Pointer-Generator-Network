Three fire engines and at least twelve firefighters were mobilised to rescue a teenage girl who was stuck in a child's swing.

The girl slid herself into the swing in Finsbury Park, north London, yesterday afternoon, but was unable to get out without assistance.

The large contingent of firefighters, who arrived in three separate fire engines, were eventually able to free her after removing the swing from its frame.

Trapped: The girl had got herself stuck in the child's swing in Finsbury Park, north London

Response: Three fire engines, which would have been carrying between 12 and 15 firefighters, can be scene attending the incident

It is believed the girl was freed after the firefighters were able to slide the swing off of her legs.

A bystander told MailOnline: 'She had her hands in her head, 
embarrassed, and was being filmed by her family and was clearly stuck in
 the child's swing.'

'A lot of firemen had showed up - they were there for about 15 minutes. They
 took the chains off the swing and managed to slide it off of her.

'She
 wasn't hurt - just embarrassed as there were a lot of 
people stood by and watching.

'People were wondering why there were so many fire engines, though.'

Crowd: The incident was reportedly filmed by friends of the girl

A spokesman for the London Fire Brigade said: 'We were called just after 6pm yesterday to a child stuck in a swing.

'We take anything to do with children seriously, and send the correct response for any eventuality.

'We never know exactly what we're going to find until we get there, but once we ascertained what it was we were able to free the child from the swing and get our fire engines away quickly.'

'Two fire engines and a fire rescue vehicle was sent. The rescue unit has specialised cutting equipment and if we are called to someone stuck we may well need to use that.'
