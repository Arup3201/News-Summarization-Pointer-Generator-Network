Hillary Clinton has a new weapon on the campaign trail  - her granddaughter Charlotte Clinton Mezvinsky.

While the presumed 2016 presidential candidate hasn't trotted her only grandchild out at any political events yet she's made reference to her in several speeches in the four weeks since she was born, including at a rally today for New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo.

'There is something about a new life in your family that really does focus you on the future, doesn't it?' Clinton told the crowd, according to Buzzfeed's Ruby Cramer.

Former Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton participates in a Women for Cuomo campaign event in New York this afternoon. At the event Clinton referenced her new granddaughter while making the case for New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo's reelection

Hillary Clinton began inserting references to her granddaughter into remarks just five days after she was born on Sept. 26.

At a real estate convention in Miami on Oct. 2 that was targeted at women, Clinton said, 'I think my granddaughter has just as much God-given potential as a boy who was born in that hospital on the same day.

'I just believe that. That’s the way I was raised,' Clinton said.

And today's event for Cuomo isn't the first time Clinton has referenced Charlotte while on the stump at a political event, either.

At a rally for Pennsylvania gubernatorial candidate Tom Wolf earlier this month Clinton told the audience, 'You should not have to be the grandchild of a president to get a good education, to get good healthcare.

'Let’s make sure we give every child in Pennsylvania the same chance that I’m determined to give my granddaughter,' she added.

Cramer said Clinton told the audience today that their state's Democratic head is the 'right leader at the right time with the right plan' for New York.

And that's 'not just because I've known Andrew Cuomo for a long time,' Clinton said. 'It is because I’m now a grandmother.' 

Cuomo, who has been suggested as a presidential contender himself, returned the love when he took the stage, telling Clinton, 'Thank you, thank you, thank you.'

'How much do we miss having Hillary Clinton in New York?' he then asked the crowd.

'I hope she does something really, really, really big,' he said of the state's former senator, Clinton.

Cramer said at least two dozen people left the event after Clinton's speech concluded. Clinton was not one of them, though.

The 2016 front runner stayed behind until the end of the event and shook hands with supporters for some time afterward.

Hillary Clinton does a meet and greet with her fans after today's event in New York. As she took the stage they shouted '2016' and 'We love you Hillary!'

As the former secretary of state took the stage, Cramer said the crowd didn't hold back their excitement about another Clinton presidential campaign.

'We love you Hillary!' they reportedly shouted, as well as '2016.'

Clinton has said she'll make a formal announcement about her political plans sometime after the midterm elections and likely at the top of the new year.

One major deterrent to a second presidential campaign that Clinton has cited is her only daughter Chelsea's first child.

The former first lady said in July that she's waiting to make a decision about 2016 until she's had some time to experience the joys of being a grandparent.

'I want to see what that feels like,' she told Charlie Rose in an interview for PBS. 'I’m not going to skip over it. I want to really be present, as I meet this … new person in our family.'

Clinton acknowledged that serving as the Commander in Chief is time consuming and 'has only gotten harder' since she lived in the White House.

'I just have to decide or not that’s what I want to do at this point in my life, ' she told Rose. 'It’s a very personal choice.'
