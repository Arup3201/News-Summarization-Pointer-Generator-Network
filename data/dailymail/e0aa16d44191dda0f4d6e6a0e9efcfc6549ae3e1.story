All good sportsmen know to keep their eye on the ball - and spectators would often do well to follow the same advice.

One fan watching England's cricket team struggle against their New Zealand hosts learned that the hard way when he was hit on the head by the ball as it was smashed for a six.

He had been chatting to his friend when Kiwi opener Hamish Rutherford managed the only six of the game, and didn't notice as the ball flew towards him.

'Look out, son!': The fan is in pain, but he is not seriously injured by the ball

Howzat? The fan looks bemused after being caught off guard on the grass verge

The commentator says 'Oh no, it's a Falcon!' when he sees the spectator get injured - Australian slang for when someone is hit on the head by a ball.

The term's name derives from rugby league player Mario 'Falcon' Fenech.

He was struck on the head when the ball was passed to him while Fenech had briefly stopped paying attention during a rugby match.

Australian TV programme The Footy Show, which Fenech had a weekly slot on, began awarding The Golden Falcon Award for similar mishaps.

The term quickly became popular and was shortened to 'Falcon'.

It is now often applied to any incident when an object hits someone on the head.

The commentator audibly winces as he sees the accident, saying: 'Look out, son!'

Then, using an Australian slang term 
for an incident where someone is struck on the head with a ball, he 
adds: 'Oh, it's a Falcon! Oh, it's a painful one too.

'He was looking the other way and he's copped it!'

It was a dream Test debut for Rutherford - but a nightmare for the spectator.

Having skittled England out for a 
pitiful 167, New Zealand finished the second day of the First Test 131-0.

Hopefully the injured fan was a Kiwi fan - otherwise his day would have been made even worse.

There was one good bit of news for him though - he was not seriously injured... and he'll be able to watch his famous accident for years.
