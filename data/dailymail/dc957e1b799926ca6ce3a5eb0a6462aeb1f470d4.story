If cutting line at a famous Austin BBQ joint lost Barack Obama a few approval rating points, the conversation he had with the cashier probably cost him even more.

When Franklin Barbecue cashier Daniel Rugg Webb saw his chance to speak to the president Thursday, he exclaimed: 'Equal rights for gay people!' Obama then asked, 'Are you gay.'

'Only when I'm having sex,' answered the part-time comedian, which made the president laugh before he realized children were around.

'Only when I'm having sex!': Daniel Rugg Webb is a part-time comedian who decided to take full advantage when faced with an encounter with the president

'Not in front of the kids!' admonished the president, before fist-bumping Webb and parting ways.

Webb told Buzzfeed that he was not so much shamed but thrilled by his presidential encounter.

'It was cool to have a moment where I was making a sitting president laugh — over something that might be considered inappropriate is a bonus,' he said.

The president had just cut the line at Franklin Barbecue, while in town to raise money for the Democratic Party.

Lives at the eatery are infamously long, and have been known to stretch as long as three hours wait.

But Mr Obama did no waiting today, as he showed up at the restaurant, shook a few hands and made his way straight to the register to order more than $300 worth of meat.

'I know this is a long line. I feel real bad, but – I’m gonna cut'  Obama said.

Sorry! Mr Obama offered to pay for the meal of the father and daughter customers directly in front of him

Even restaurant owner Aaron Franklin said the move was unheard of.

'That's out thing, no one skips the line...except Obama,' Mr Franklin told the Statesman.

Mr Franklin and his daughter took a picture with the president, who he said 'seems like a nice dude'.

And to the president's credit, he did pay for the order of a local father and daughter who were directly in front of him.

While the restaurant seemed more focused on getting to see the president than they were on the fact that he cut them in line, others on Twitter were not as enthused about the president's line manners. 

'No, no, no President Obama, You wait in line for 3 hours at Franklin's BBQ like everyone else!' a user named Kelly wrote.

Mr Obama ordered some $300 dollars worth of barbecue - not including the order he offered to pay for - carrying out 'eight pounds of brisket, ribs, sausage and turkey' to feed the legions on Air Force One.

When he was paying for his order, the president first brought out a sad was of $1 dollar bills, before flashing his black JP Morgan card for the cameras.

The president would leave Texas with out 
giving in to demands from Texas lawmakers and from around the state to 
visit the border, where a child migrant crisis is unfolding and instead 
said his critics should get behind his request for $3.7 billion if they 
want to solve the problem.

'Are folks more interested in politics or are they more interested in solving the problem,' Obama said he told Perry. 'If they are interested in solving the problem then this can be solved. If the preference is for politics then it won’t be solved.'

Obama visited Texas for the first time since the influx of child migrants from Central America overwhelmed border resources. He had talks with Perry aboard his Marine One helicopter and in a group meeting with local officials that Obama called constructive.

In a brief news conference after the meeting, Obama dismissed criticism from Perry, a potential 2016 Republican presidential candidate, that he should personally visit the border region for a first-hand look.

'This isn’t theater. This is a problem. I’m not interested in photo ops. I’m interested in solving a problem,' he said.

The president, on a three-day trip out of Washington, is spending much time raising money for Democratic congressional candidates, leading to criticism that he should spend some time visiting the border. Obama said he is getting plenty of information from top advisers who are visiting the area.

'There’s nothing that is taking place down there that I am not intimately aware of and briefed on,' he said.

Obama is battling political pressure from supporters and opponents alike to halt a growing humanitarian crisis along the Texas border with Mexico.
