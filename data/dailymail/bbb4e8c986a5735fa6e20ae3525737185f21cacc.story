Canada's friendly robot, with his trendy boots and garden gloves, had just one dream: to hitchhike his way across Canada.

Many thought he wouldn't make it. The innocent robot, they said, would end up being sold as scrap within days.

But Hitchbot has surprised the world by completing his journey from Nova Scotia to British Columbia after hitchhiking 3,700 miles (6,000km) on the open road.

The robot, assembled from household items by Dr Frauke Zeller and Professor David Smith, was reunited with its creators at an art gallery in British Columbia.

The pair devised the trip to provide insights into how people interact with robots.

'This project turns our fear of technology on its head and asks 'can robots trust humans?',' said Dr Zeller, an assistant professor at Ryerson University.

One of Hitchbot's arms is permanently fixed in a hitchhike position, and the droid was able to tweet its thoughts to the general public during his journey.

Equipped with GPS, 3G wireless connectivity, a camera, the Hitchbot was also be able to monitor its progress across Canada.

To keep drivers engaged in conversation, Hitchbot ran social media and Wikipedia application programming interfaces so that it could make small talk

Images and messages posted on Twitter showed the robot, being driven westward across forests, mountains and prairies.

It made stops to fish and camp, attended a wedding and even made an appearance at an aboriginal pow wow.

'Our aim is to further discussion in society about our relationship with technology and robots,' said Dr Zeller.

To keep drivers engaged in conversation, Hitchbot ran social media and Wikipedia application programming interfaces so that it could make small talk.

The droid also has artificial intelligence (AI) systems that allowed it to recognise speech and converse with people it found on its journey.

The friendly robot began his trip on July 27 in Canada's Atlantic port city of Halifax, after being picked up by an elderly couple in a camper van.

The child-sized robot is able to stand, making it visible to drivers via a retractable tripod. 

It has a car seat attached to its torso so drivers can strap it into their cars using seatbelts.

Matthew Berry, of Alberta, said some friends picked up the robot while heading to a wedding in Golden, B.C.

They picked it up on the border between Alberta and Calgary, where its previous driver was looking to offload it.

'It was good fun; we took it out onto the dance floor to, well, do the real robot,' Mr Berry said.

'It was funny because it was a very meticulously planned wedding so I wasn't sure how the bride would react, but she loved it.'

Mr Berry said while the couple was giving their speech, the bride thanked the couple's friends for attending, and the robot interrupted, saying, 'I like to make friends.'

Researchers said they will use comments posted on social media to find out more about the public's attitudes to encounters with the robot.

Using its charm and good looks, Hitchbot convinced people to drive him from Halifax, Nova Scotia (pictured right), to Victoria, British Columbia (pictured left). Although the robot wants to travel from one point in Canada to another, the route will depend on the drivers and could take it into the U.S.

In a country dominated by 'kawaii' - or cute culture - Japan has embraced the rise of cuddly robots.

Now, one Tokyo-based firm has unveiled what it believes to be the world's first droid that can read human emotions.

Mobile carrier Softbank said its robot, named Pepper, will go on sale in Japan in February for 198,000 yen (£1,130 or $1,900).

The machine, which has no legs, but has gesticulating hands appeared on a stage in a Tokyo suburb, cooing and humming. 

Pepper
 uses an 'emotional engine' and a cloud-based artificial intelligence to
 study gestures, expressions and human speech tones.

The
 48-inch (121 cm) tall, 62 lb (28 kg) white Pepper has no hair, but two 
large doll-like eyes and a flat-panel display stuck on its chest.

It was developed jointly with Aldebaran Robotics, which designs, produces and sells autonomous humanoid robots.
