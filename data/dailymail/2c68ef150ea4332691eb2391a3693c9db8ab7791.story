He dresses some of the world's most famous women so it comes as little surprise that Michael Kors has roped in his most glamorous friends to promote his latest charity campaign.

The acclaimed designer, who is a firm favourite in Hollywood, has called on John Legend's wife Chrissy Teigen, as well as Victoria's Secret models Candice Swanepoel and Lily Aldridge to promote Watch Hunger Stop, his campaign to end world hunger.

The trio look natural yet stylish wearing his T-shirt, which is free in select Michael Kors stores this month.

Utilising the power of social media, Michael Kors is encouraging wearers to take a selfie in their T-shirt and upload it with the hashtag #WatchHungerStop.

The charitable designer has made a personal pledge to donate 100 meals to children in need every time that someone posts the snap.

Support: Sports Illustrated covergirl Chrissy Teigen said: 'Food is obviously such a huge part of my life, and knowing that one in nine people do not have enough to eat is so upsetting.  We have the platform to help fix this, so why not use it'

Kors established his charitable initiative last year and he works with the United Nations World Food Programme in an attempt to end world hunger. 

On top of this, he has created 100 Series timepieces available silver, gold, and a limited-edition rose gold with money for each watch sold going towards buying a nutritious meal through the United Nations World Food Programme’s school meals program. 

Speaking to InStyle about the campaign, Chrissy said: 'After seeing the success of the last Watch Hunger Stop campaign, I knew I had to be a part of it.

'Food is obviously such a huge part of my life, and knowing that one in nine people do not have enough to eat is so upsetting. And it’s happening right here and all across the globe. We have the platform to help fix this, so why not use it.' 

So far, model Amber Le Bon, A-list actress Halle Berry and designer Rachel Roy have posted their own selfies.
