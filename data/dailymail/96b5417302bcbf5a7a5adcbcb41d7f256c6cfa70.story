Facebook could be investigated by the U.S. government over claims it is tracking users after they have logged out of the social networking site.

Reps Massachusetts Democrat Ed Markey and Texas Republican Joe Barton have both complained to the Federal Trade Commission (FTC).

Their letter follows privacy fears over tracking cookies sparked by Australian blogger Nik Cubrilovic, who prompted a Facebook investigation.

Reps Markey and Barton have both been vigorously pursuing Facebook on privacy issues, reported the Los Angeles Times.

‘When users log out of Facebook, they are under the expectation that Facebook is no longer monitoring their activities,’ they wrote.

‘We believe this impression should be the reality.’

Facebook insisted it has addressed Mr Cubrilovic’s concerns about cookies and never monitors the browsing habits of users.

‘We value the security community and their willingness to provide feedback on issues that they identify,’ a Facebook spokesman said.

The issues arose when users had logged out of Facebook but visited websites featuring the ‘Like’ button, reported Politico.

‘I want to make it clear that there was no security or privacy breach,' Facebook engineer W. Gregg Stefancik told the Los Angeles Times.

‘Facebook did not store or use any information it should not have.’

Mr Stefancik said three cookies on some users’ computers included ‘unique identifiers’ when they had logged out of the social networking site.

But he added that the identifiers for logged out users were not stored by Facebook and could therefore not have been used for tracking.

‘In addition, we fixed the cookies so that they won't include unique information in the future when people log out,’ Mr Stefancik wrote.

Privacy group the Electronic Privacy Information Center will also ask the FTC to investigate whether Facebook’s new Ticker and Timeline features increase privacy risks.
