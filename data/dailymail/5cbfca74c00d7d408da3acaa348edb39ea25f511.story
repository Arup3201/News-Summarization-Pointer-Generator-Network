Courtney Lawes couldn’t understand what all the fuss was about.

Asked by a French journalist to explain the ‘story’ of his sledgehammer tackle on Jules Plisson, the England lock was non-plussed.

‘There’s not much of a story really,’ he said, in reference to the incident at Twickenham last Saturday. ‘That’s just what I do.’

Lawes certainly made sure that ‘Le Crunch’ lived up to its billing, but France were incensed. Two days later, it emerged that they had cited the Northampton player, but the match commissioner was satisfied that the officials, led by referee Nigel Owens, had been right to take no action.

This episode generated enormous interest and debate, and served to highlight an issue that rugby is currently faced with; how to find the balance between embracing its extreme physicality, or fretting about it. 

Footage of Lawes levelling his opponent – complete with countless replays – was prominently displayed on the RBS Six Nations website and, as of Thursday, it had received in excess of 963,000 'hits' (an appropriate term in this case) on YouTube.

There is no doubt that monster collisions are part of the game’s box-office appeal. The sight of huge men smashing each other and accepting the punishment with minimal complaint is one factor that sets the sport apart from most others. But officials are also wary about being seen to glorify brutality, even when it falls within the laws.

Concussion remains a hot topic. The threat of legal intervention hangs heavy. Scrum sequences have been amended in the quest for greater safety. Rucking – in terms of vigorous use of feet – has been outlawed. Punch-ups are a fading phenomenon. A crusade against so-called dangerous tackling continues; so aerial contests for the ball have become a grey area of unrest and confusion.

In the age of ‘super slo-mo’ replays, acts of aggression such as the one by Lawes appear worse or more impressive than in real-time, depending on your viewpoint. Frame by frame, the size and force of modern rugby is being laid bare, and the powers-that-be worry about parents of the next generation of players taking fright and directing their children towards other sports.

As severe injuries occur with alarming frequency, the constant gaze of countless cameras means there is no hiding from the fact that this is a tough game, with inherent risks. But in different ways, it was ever thus. This is not an activity played in cotton wool. Bravery is a pre-requisite. Rugby cannot be fully sanitised for mass consumption, or it will lose its warrior soul.

Australian rugby has been rocked by a homophobia controversy, which could have profound ramifications. During a Super 15 clash between the Waratahs and Brumbies in Sydney last weekend, the visitors’ vice-captain, David Pocock, twice complained to referee Craig Joubert about homophobic abuse by an opponent. Days later, the Waratahs’ flanker, Jacques Potgeiter, was fined and apologised for using inappropriate language.

The episode has divided opinion Down Under, with many acclaiming Pocock – a staunch supporter of gay rights – for taking a stand, while others have complained that the issue should not have been so publicly exposed. The esteemed openside has captained his country before and could do so again at the World Cup, but there is a suspicion that he may have removed himself from the running, with one commentator saying: ‘He’ll pay for it. It will mean that he never captain the Wallabies again.’ 

The man who will make that call, Australia coach Michael Cheika, also happens to be coach of the Waratahs, but he is adamant the saga will not harm Pocock’s leadership prospects. Meanwhile, there are fears of a possible split between Waratahs and Brumbies contingents in the Wallaby camp. Messy – very messy.

Fresh from the success of their young team, led by the outstanding England prospect, Maro Itoje, in last Sunday’s LV Cup Final, Saracens are hoping to mark the return of the Aviva Premiership this weekend by beating their own world record for a club rugby attendance.

Advance ticket sales have passed the current record figure of 83,889, for Saturday's showdown with London rivals Harlequins at Wembley.

However, while that fixture provides the glamorous backdrop, Leicester’s encounter with Exeter at Welford Road has the most significance in terms of the league table. The Chiefs are second but sit just two points ahead of the fifth-placed Tigers, and Saturday's match will be a fascinating test of the Devon club’s credentials as genuine title challengers.

There must be something about playing prop for England that unleashes the inner performing artist in otherwise quiet, even shy characters. After the victory over France at Twickenham, Leicester’s Dan Cole delivered a stirring rendition of ‘Singing in the Rain’ in front of a large audience, to mark his 50th Test cap. A video of his animated efforts has become a sensation on the internet. Cole is following in a proud recent tradition. Alex Corbisiero is a much-lauded rapper, who is known for his improvised lyrics, to herald famous victories. Andrew Sheridan combined being England’s scrum destroyer-in-chief for several years with producing country and western albums, while Matt Stevens appeared on celebrity X-factor, to showcase his crooning quality. 

Last Word

Six days on from ‘Super Saturday’, after taking stock, the conclusion is unchanged; that it was the greatest day of drama in the long history of the championship, and the magnitude of the events was felt far beyond rugby’s usual constituencies.

At the peak, during England v France, the BBC reported viewing figures just shy of 10 million. This follows the revelation that the Six Nations board will consider switching to pay-TV after the current rights deal expires in 2017.

Such a move would be utter lunacy. Tournament organisers and the unions must recognise that the wide exposure delivered by a terrestrial broadcaster is worth far more than whatever large sums are on offer. The likes of Sky and BT Sport provide superb coverage, but this annual surge of public interest is priceless for rugby.

Meanwhile, in the aftermath of the championship’s epic finale, this column would recognise the merit of a bonus-point scheme, providing an extra five points were awarded for a Grand Slam. And as for a Player of the Championship nomination, look no further than Paul O’Connell – colossal captain of triumphant Ireland.
