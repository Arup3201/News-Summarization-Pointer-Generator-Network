Tim Sherwood faces a difficult early task as Aston Villa manager in trying to convince captain Ron Vlaar to stay after it emerged the Dutch international has no plans to sign a new contract at the club.

Vlaar, on around £40,000 per week, is out of contact at the end of this season and is understood to have told Villa of his intention to explore his options. Manchester United and Southampton are admirers.

The 30-year-old starred under Louis van Gaal at last year's World Cup and is aware his next decision will be hugely important after reaching a watershed age.

Vlaar returned with an impressive display against Leicester after six weeks out through a knee injury and Sherwood would like him to stay.

'I’m not sure what the club have done with that,' he said of negotiations. 'Obviously the club want to keep their best players. I’m sure the club will endeavour to try and keep Ron.

'It’s not really for now. The focus is picking the right team and Ron focusing on playing and doing the best for the club.

'I was very impressed with him. You need experience. They have experienced themselves getting out of trouble at the end of the season. We need to try and do that this season and then try to look forward. First things first we need to stay in the division.' 

Despite Villa sitting 18th without a win in 10 Premier League games, Sherwood is confident. 'I am grateful for the opportunity here and I will give it everything,' he said. 'All I can do is my best and I think my best is going to be good enough.'
