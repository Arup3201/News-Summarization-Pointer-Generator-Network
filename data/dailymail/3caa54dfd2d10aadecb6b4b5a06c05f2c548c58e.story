Jailed: Mitchel Graham

A judge yesterday said he had no choice but to give a ‘ridiculously short’ prison sentence to a driver who horrifically injured a policeman known as ‘Robocop’.

Diederik Coetzee, who made an astonishing 404 arrests in 2006, was thrown 24ft from his bicycle in the hit and run.

Ten months on, the once super-fit 55-year-old is still in hospital and has had to end his remarkable career. The driver, Mitchel Graham, sped from the scene, leaving the constable lying in the road.

But Judge Jonathan Teare QC said Parliament had decided he could give Graham no more than 15 months behind bars.

‘That may seem ridiculously short for those who grieve for the loss of their husband and father, but that is all I can do,’ he told Nottingham Crown Court.

The maximum sentence for dangerous driving is two years but a shorter term is given to offenders who plead guilty.

Graham admitted dangerous driving and failing to stop. The court heard he knew his car was in a highly dangerous condition when he ploughed into Mr Coetzee, who was off duty and cycling to an exercise class in Blidworth, Nottinghamshire, at 6pm on November 25.

Paul Stimson, prosecuting, said the drive shaft, exhaust and brakes of Graham’s car were defective and the tyres were worn.

The de-mister was also faulty – meaning Graham was ‘driving almost blind’ on his near side, where Mr Coetzee struck the windscreen.

injuries when he was hit while on his bike by Mitchel Graham's car last 
November

The 26-year-old pig farmer hid the damaged Volkswagen Corrado in his brother’s garage and only gave himself up four days later.

Graham, of Blidworth, admitted 
drinking two cans of lager before the incident but escaped a breath test
because he fled the scene.

Mr Coetzee suffered a fractured skull and bleeding to the brain. He is being cared for at a specialist hospital in Northampton.

The prosecutor said he had developed a
personality disorder, has restricted movement, memory and judgment, and
needs help with walking and completing simple tasks.

He can no longer stand unaided and is able to spend only weekends with his family.

In 2005, Mr Coetzee became Britain’s 
top arresting officer with 309 ‘collars’ as he patrolled a council 
estate in Mansfield on his mountain bike. The next year the total was 
404.
