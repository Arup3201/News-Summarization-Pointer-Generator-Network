Motorists were paid more than £22million in compensation for pothole damage to their cars last year, consumer magazine Which? has revealed.

And that figure is set to soar as the cold snap increases the chances of cracking and craters on the nation’s highways.

The Which? report says councils in England and Wales paid out a total of £22.8 million to motorists who made a claim for vehicle repairs or injury caused by badly maintained roads.

Damage: Motorists were paid over £22million in compensation last year for damage to their cars caused by potholes, a new report shows

The figures suggest some councils prefer to leave potholes in place and settle the claims on their insurance rather than pay to fix the underlying problem from their road maintenance budgets.

But individual also motorists face a ‘pothole lottery’ depending on where they live, says Which?

Councils in the North West of England paid out the most in compensation at £8million, according to figures collated for Which? by the Asphalt Industry Association.

It was followed by Yorkshire and Humberside (£3.3million), London (£3.2million), the South east (£2.7million) the west Midlands (£1.8million) and Wales (£1.4million).

The Government commissioned a Potholes Review in 2011 and allocated an extra £200 million for local highway authorities, citing a ‘significant increase in the number of potholes on the already fragile local highway network’.

And in December the Government gave English councils an extra £140million to maintain the highways.

But Which? found that the backlog of road repairs per local authority in England is getting bigger, growing from £53.2 million in 2009 to £61.3 million last year.

Costly: Local authorities have estimated that it would cost £12.93billion to clear the entire road maintenance backlog in the UK

Further damage: The current icy weather conditions will increase the risk of cracks and craters on the country's road network

Local authorities have estimated that it would cost £12.93 billion to clear the entire road maintenance backlog in the UK.

The report said it would cost £52,583 per mile to repair every damaged road in England - excluding A roads and motorways.

North West (17councils)             £8m

Yorkshire & Humberside (10 councils)           £3.3m

London (24 councils)                  £3.2m

South east (13 councils)             £2.7m

West Midlands (7 councils)         £1.8m

Wales (14 councils)                    £1.4m

North east (10 councils)              £1m

South west (11 councils)             £1m

East (9 councils)                         £0.3m

East Midlands (6 councils)          £0.1m

TOTAL ENGLAND & WALES       £22.8m

The Which? report notes: ‘Potholes develop when cracks in the road fill with water, which expands when it freezes.

‘Our data shows that, in England and Wales at least, the backlog of road repairs has grown since 2009, and another harsh winter could see it grow again.

Road defects also seem to affect some parts of the UK more than others.’

In November highway bosses at the Local Government Association (LGA) representing 370 councils across England and Wales warned that motorists face a pothole ‘catastrophe’ stretching for thousands of miles as Britain’s crumbling roads reach crisis point.

It said budget cut-backs and the threat of another severe winter mean many councils are struggling to move ‘beyond simply patching up a deteriorating network’ - despite filling in holes at the rate of ‘one every 16 seconds’.

Which? Says motorists should challenge councils to pay up when their vehicles are damaged as an incentive for them to keep roads in good order - and collect photographic evidence to support their claims.

Which? executive director Richard 
Lloyd said: ‘Potholes are a menace for all road users. With temperatures
plummeting this week and the bitter weather conditions set to continue,
the backlog of repairs could grow again.’

He said;’ Drivers should help themselves and everyone else on the road by pointing out potholes to the local council.’

The watchdog said the chance of 
claims being successful depended on whether the local authority was 
aware of the pothole in the first place and had not repaired it or if it
had not followed road maintenance guidelines.

Potholes
can be reported via a council’s website and the Directgov website lists
which council is responsible for specific roads.

Professor
Stephen Glaister, director of the RAC Foundation, said: ‘Potholes are 
fast becoming financial black holes. Councils are sadly mistaken if they
think they are saving money by not repairing the roads. These figures 
reveal the opposite is true. Just before Christmas the government dished
out an extra £140million for road maintenance. It needs to be spent 
promptly before the claims bill goes through the roof.’

An AA survey shows that nationally on average motorists across Britain are facing average of 6.25 potholes per mile, while pedestrians are facing nearly two potholes per mile on paths and pavements. Scotland was found to have the worst roads with an average of 8.9 potholes per mile on the roads and 2.81 on pavements.

AA president Edmund King said: ‘Although patching up the roads after last winter’s ravages has brought some improvement, their condition is on a knife-edge and drivers are still likely to have to dodge potholes.’

Local Transport Minister Norman Baker said: ‘We are providing councils with more than £3billion between 2011 and 2015 to maintain their roads and pavements and last month announced an extra £215 million to help councils get the best out of their road network.

‘This is on top of the additional £200 million we gave to councils in March 2011 to repair local roads damaged by the severe winter weather in 2010.’

He said: ‘It is ultimately up to local highway authorities to determine how they prioritise their funding, but we want to help them get the best value for money.’
