A former Emmerdale actor is being investigated over claims he raped a 13-year-old boy at his home in the early 1970s.

The star is said to have lured the boy to his house by promising he would meet famous actors and agents at a party that night.

The alleged victim has given statements to detectives investigating the Jimmy Savile sex abuse scandal, reports the Sunday Mirror.

An ex-Emmerdale star is being investigated over claims he raped a 13-year-old boy at his home in the early 1970s

Detectives investigating the Jimmy Savile sex abuse scandal have taken statements from a man who claims he was sexually assaulted at the actor's home

He is said to have told police that he was on his way to watch an amateur dramatics production in the village where he grew up when the actor pulled up in his car and asked the boy if he knew who he was.

The man claims he was handed a £5 note and invited to the party by the actor before getting in to the car with him and driving to a house, according to the newspaper.

The alleged victim told officers that he was pinned down by three men there before the actor raped him.

He claims he blacked out following the assault and was thrown out of the house naked, before his clothes were thrown after him and he walked home in shock.

The man told police that it is the first time he has spoken about the incident and has found relationships difficult since the encounter.

The man made the allegations to Operation Yewtree officers investigating Jimmy Savile

A West Yorkshire Police spokesman told the Sunday Mirror: 'We have received an allegation of child sexual ­offences from the 1970s.

'Enquiries are on­going.'

The claims against the former Emmerdale actor are the latest allegations against high-profile figures from the entertainment world since Savile's offences were revealed.

On Friday, soap star Bill Roache was charged with sexually assaulting four girls, one as young as 11, in the late 1960s.

A month before, the Coronation Street actor, who plays Ken Barlow, was charged with twice raping a schoolgirl in 1967.

Fellow Coronation Street star Michael
 Le Vell, who plays mechanic Kevin Webster, is also currently off air 
after being charged with 19 sexual offences against a child, including 
rape, indecent assault and sexual activity.

He denies the charges, which are not linked to Roache.

This week, former Radio 1 DJ Chris 
Denning was arrested and bailed by Savile detectives on suspicion of 
'historic allegations' of sexual offences.

It is understood he is not accused of any offences with Savile, a former colleague.

Last
 month, the Mail revealed that comedian Jim Davidson is being 
investigated by Operation Yewtree officers over claims he indecently 
assaulted a woman in the Falkland Islands in the 1980s during a concert 
tour.

The attack is alleged
 to have happened while the former Generation Game host was entertaining
 British troops stationed there after the Falklands conflict.

Davidson, 59, was originally arrested in January over alleged sex offences in the UK. He denies all the allegations.

Other arrested celebrities include entertainer Rolf Harris, DJ Dave Lee Travis and comedian Freddie Starr. Disgraced pop star Glitter has also been detained.

They deny any wrongdoing.

PR guru Max Clifford has been charged with 11 historic counts of indecent assault against teenage girls.

The 70-year-old has vowed to clear his name, labelling the allegations ‘a load of nonsense’.
