Raheem Sterling thrilling display against Chelsea provided the perfect riposte to critics who questioned his mid-season break in the Caribbean.

After scoring Liverpool's equaliser in the first leg of their Capital One Cup semi-final, Sterling said: 'I knew I would get loads of stick for being given the break, but the manager did say at the start of the season that this is what he would do.'

Brendan Rodgers' decision to rest Sterling, 20, caused controversy, not least because the player told Roy Hodgson in Estonia that he was too tired to take part in a training session.

Sterling added: 'I have played a lot of minutes for someone my age, but I am not complaining about that.

'I think (the break) will help me. I am back now, refreshed and ready to go again.

'It is always good to get a few days off. I am focused on where I need to be at which is helping the team by scoring or providing assists.

'Mentally you feel it. I got a lot of stick about the tired stuff with England so it all came down on me. But at the end of the day, it was the manager who makes the decisions. If he says take a week off who am I to say no?'

Fellow Liverpool striker Daniel Sturridge could be involved in the second leg at Stamford Bridge, which would be welcomed by Sterling.

He added: 'We are a team. I am not trying to pick up a "main man status" this season. As long as the team wins and we get good performances that is all that matters to me.'
