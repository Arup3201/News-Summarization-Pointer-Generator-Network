Emmanuel Adebayor has put a halt to a possible loan move to QPR because the Tottenham forward has no desire to join the Loftus Road club.

Adebayor has told Spurs he will wait for other options to emerge, but QPR are the only team to have opened formal talks over a loan move until the end of the season.  

Adebayor was brought to White Hart Lane by current Hoops boss Harry Redknapp, who is keen to strike a deal to bring the front man in on a temporary basis.

Redknapp says that QPR are targeting signings before the end of the January transfer window

The Tongan striker has featured just 11 times in the Premier League this season after taking a two month break for personal reasons. 

The only issue concerning Redknapp during negotiations are the striker's wages, which are said to be around £100,000-per-week.

But QPR owner Tony Fernandes said that the club do not anticipate any new signings coming in before the window shuts.

He Tweeted: 'No more cheque book. We have good players. Bought all the players manager asked for in sunmer. Our players not mercenaries. Good guys.'

However, he later added: 'If something intresting comes up we would look at it. But I'm not optimistic. Given the right motivation, tactics and coaching we can achieve much more.' 

The 30-year-old is out of favour at White Hart Lane following the meteoric rise in form of young Harry Kane. 

Kane, who confirmed a new five-and-a-half year deal on Monday morning, netted his 20th goal of the season against West Brom on Saturday. 

The 21-year-old will now commit his future to the  club until 2020 - on terms of £45,000 a week.

Harry Kane is now Tottenham's first choice striker after his rise in form at the north London club
