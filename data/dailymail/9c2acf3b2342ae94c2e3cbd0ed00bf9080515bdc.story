Jose Mourinho has hit back at criticism levelled at Chelsea, chiefly by Sergio Ramos, and suggested there were 'double standards' at play in the club versus country row to have engulfed the Blues' season.

Cesc Fabregas (hamstring) and Diego Costa (groin) withdrew from Spain's squad for a European Championship qualifier with Belarus and a friendly against Germany.

It prompted Spain defender Ramos to say he would like players to show the same commitment to the national side as they do their club.

But Mourinho, Ramos's old manager at Real Madrid, dismissed the comments.

'Ramos is a fantastic player but he is not a doctor,' said Mourinho. 'He is not a doctor and I am the same.

'My doctor and the Spanish national team doctor, they had the scans and decided the player was not in a fit condition to play. I don't think Sergio did a medicine masters in the last couple of years to understand it.

'Vincent Kompany played for Man City, but he didn't play for Belgium (against Wales),' the Portuguese added. 'He was injured. Okay?

'Did Leighton Baines play for Everton? No, he didn't but how many players were injured for the international teams and could recover one week later, doing his work at the club? Lots of them, lots of them. 

'My doctor and the doctor of the Spanish national team, they had the scans and they decided that the player was not in the condition to play.'

Mourinho suggested there have been double standards in the reports about Costa, again highlighting Kompany's absence and subsequent return for Manchester City as they beat Swansea.

'Kompany didn't play for Belgium against Wales and he played on Saturday,' he said.

'Has he a compromise with his national team? I think he has. He is the captain of Belgium.

'Did he, how do you say, "cheat" by not playing against Wales to play today? I don't think he did. So we all accept that he was injured.'
