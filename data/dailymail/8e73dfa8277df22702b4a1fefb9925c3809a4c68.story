Piri Weepu may be a World Cup-winning All Black with an international pedigree but arguably his greatest achievement is simply being alive to tell the tale.

In February, the 71-times capped scrum-half, 31, who will make his Aviva Premiership debut on Sunday for London Welsh against Exeter, was taking part in a routine recovery session in the swimming pool for his former Super Rugby side the Blues when disaster struck.

‘Me, Charles Piutau and Peter Saili were in the water doing lengths for recovery, stretching and whatnot,’ said Weepu, speaking for the first time about the stroke which almost cost him his life.

‘I went to explain something to them and found myself talking like a kid, a baby really. I couldn’t say any words. Nothing.

‘I got frustrated. I felt like an idiot. I got out of the pool and went to get dressed but I couldn’t hear anything. All I could concentrate on was what was happening directly in front of me. A few of the boys were trying to chat away to me but I couldn’t understand what they were saying.

Confused:  Auckland's Weepu thought he was suffering from the effects of a concussion during the stroke but it was a hole in his heart, doctors found

‘I had a bit of blurred vision and scarily I actually drove home. It was probably only a kilometre and a half so I drove as slowly as possible. I stopped if I needed to. I kept checking my eyes to see if it was something I had done in the pool. 

‘I remember texting the team doctor to ask for help. But I didn’t know what I was doing or even how to use my phone properly to send the text. I got home and decided to wait it out a bit and see what happened before ringing the doc to work out what to do. I chilled out for about half an hour and started packing my bag before ringing the doctor to find out what was going on. It was a pretty scary not knowing what it was.’

Initially Weepu put the symptoms down to a concussion suffered in a previous game. But tests revealed he had suffered a stroke after blood was prevented from reaching his brain by a previously undiagnosed heart condition. 

‘I had a hole in my heart and they’re putting the stroke down to that,’ he said. ‘At the time I thought it may have been a delayed concussion type of injury. But once I’d had all the scans we realised it was to do with the heart.’

Weepu required surgery to block the hole and now, seven months later, he says he is ready to resurrect his career after becoming one of the Premiership’s few high-profile summer signings. But surely such a dramatic health scare called him to question his chosen profession?

‘Not at all,’ he said. ‘I would have done anything possible to get back on a rugby field. The only I way I would have hung up the boots would have been if I’d broken my leg again. I’d probably stay out on the field even if I was crawling. I tell my coaches all the time, “Don’t take me off unless I’m out on a stretcher”.

‘All I wanted to know after the stroke was what the procedures were and what I needed to do to get back out on the pitch. I don’t really know the background that caused me to have it. I’ve just been trying to make the most of life in general. It’s not easy to bounce back. It’s in the back of your head that something like that could happen again.

‘I’ve seen it [the stroke] as another opportunity at life and trying to make the most of it. That’s the whole reason I came to the UK. This opportunity may not have come around this year or the year after. I’ve been playing Super Rugby for the last 11 seasons so it will be good to see what the Premiership is all about.’ 

On Sunday he will find out, partnering former England three-quarter Olly Barkley at half-back, as Justin Burnell’s hastily assembled squad attempt to give the Exiles the perfect start to the season against Rob Baxter’s Chiefs.

Weepu, who kicked the All Blacks to the World Cup final in 2011, will do so convinced he is ready to resume his career. He is content and ready for the next step in a rugby career that almost ended in that Auckland pool.

‘It’s early days but I’m enjoying life here,’ he said. ‘It’s good to be able to walk down the street and not be yelled at and expected to react like we are back home. I don’t mind it. But if you want to get my attention then just approach me rather than try to yell for my attention.

‘I’ve got no dramas with that. I might be a World Cup winner but people should just say ‘hello’. I’m not going to bite them.’

He is more concerned with taking a second bite at life.
