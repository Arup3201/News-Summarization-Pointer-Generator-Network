Primary school teacher Elen Meirion, had got up in the middle of the night to go to the toilet when she accidentally stumbled on the landing and fell, an inquest heard

A school choir conductor who won a major award on BBC’s Songs of Praise was killed after she drank wine and plunged down a flight of stairs at her home.

Primary school teacher Elen Meirion, had got up in the middle of the night to go to the toilet when she accidentally stumbled on the landing and fell, an inquest heard.

The inquest was told she fell from 'top to bottom', hitting her head on a desk at the foot of the stairs.

A friend who was in the house and heard her slip and call out, said she found Mrs Meirion in the hallway with head injuries.

The 43-year-old died two days later in hospital with her family by her bedside.

Tests on her blood showed she would have been two and a half times the legal limit for driving.

A verdict of accidental death was recorded after the hearing was told she suffered from an 'unsurvivable' head trauma.

The tragedy occurred in April, a year after the divorced mother of one - sister of Welsh opera singer Rhys Meirion - directed pupils at Ysgol Pen Barras school in Ruthin, North Wales at the Songs of Praise junior school choir of the year title for 2011.

The hearing in Llandudno was told she had been visited by her on-off companion David Tudor at her house in Ruthin and he said she was 'jolly and bubbly'.

It heard she had been drinking white wine and Cava whilst he drank vodka and they spent a 'chilled and relaxed' evening together before going went to bed.

'Later I heard her get up,' said Mr Tudor in a statement read to the hearing.

'I thought she was going to the toilet. I recall her making an ‘oo’ sound and I heard a light fall. I was almost asleep. I thought ‘Has Elen just fallen down stairs?’

Mr Tudor went downstairs to investigate found her with back and bottom on the wooden floor and her legs slightly up the stairs.

He said: 'I heard a gurgling sound. 
Putting the light on, I saw she was lying on her back with her head 
resting against a desk. I realised the noise was coming from her 
throat.'

He dialled 999 
and helped paramedics carry Ms Meirion on a spinal board out through the
patio doors because the other doorways were too narrow.

He travelled in the ambulance with her to Ysbyty Glan Clwyd hospital where she spent two days in the intensive care unit.

But her condition deteriorated and it was 'too late' for neurosurgery. She died on April 17 at 7.28am.

A
pathologist found she had 207 microgrammes of alcohol in 100 
millilitres of blood. The legal driving limit would have been 80mg.

Mr
Tudor added: 'I can’t believe this has happened. I have lost someone I 
care for very much about and who I loved spending time with. She was a 
completely lovely person in every way and very special.'

Mrs
Meirion's daughter Gwen, 15, arranged for her mother’s kidneys, liver, 
pancreas and heart valves for transplant - which save the life of five 
other people.

Shortly before her mother died the teenager worked with her mother on a school project about the pros and cons of organ donation.

Up to £15,000 was raised at Mrs Meirion’s funeral in aid of the Welsh Air Ambulance and Intensive Care Unit at Ysbyty Glan Clwyd.

At the time of her death Mrs Meirion’s family spoke of their pride for the teacher and told how Ysgol Pen Barras were the first choir from Wales to win the Songs of Praise competition.

A statement from the family read: 'Elen¿s passing leaves an irreplaceable void in the family and the community as a whole

A statement from the family read: 'Elen’s passing leaves an irreplaceable void in the family and the community as a whole.

'She loved her family life and her life was music. She ws a loving daughter and sister, as well as a devoted mother.'

Mrs Meirion’s ex-husband, Rob Boyns, 44, who runs an IT company added: 'When Gwen did her school project, Elen helped her with the research and they had both come to the conclusion that organ donation was a good thing.

'Gwen’s teacher read her work and he said it had brought a tear to his eye. When Elen was in hospital, the team at the ICU worked with Gwen, whose suggestion it was to donate Elen’s vital organs before the imminent loss of her life.

'When unexpected circumstances dictate that a member of your family suffers in this fashion, it hits everybody hard and having a generous team like the team at Glan Clwyd looking after you is paramount.

'They were very kind and understanding. They provided facilities which made the family’s stay more comfortable and took time, love and care to explain the processes involved.”

Tenor Rhys fundraised in memory of his sister saying: 'Elen really was a very popular person and she was very special. She did a huge amount for so many people.

'We are pulling together as a family to support each other and help Gwen as much as we can.”

Rhys Meirion has performed worldwide for companies, including Welsh National Opera and English National Opera, as well as on TV and at the National Eisteddfod.
