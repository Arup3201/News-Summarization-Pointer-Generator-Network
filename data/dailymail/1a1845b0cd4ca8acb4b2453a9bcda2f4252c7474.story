A coffee controversy is brewing.

A new cafe in Los Angeles is calling itself Dumb Starbucks Coffee and using the same logo as the global coffee giant, but staff insist they're not breaking any laws.

In fact, it looks almost identical to the real Starbucks apart from one word - 'dumb'.

The coffee shop which is based in the Los Feliz / Silverlake area of the city says that by using the word, it makes it a parody and is therefore permissible under freedom of speech laws.

Just great coffee: A parody coffee shop mocking Starbucks opened in Los Angeles and quickly became a sensation on social media

Dumb: Although it looks liked Starbucks, smells like Starbucks and even acts like Starbucks (the super-friendly baristas asking for your name were hired off Craigslist), the whole thing is an elaborate goof on Starbucks culture

It's all so dumb: You can buy an dumb iced coffee or a dumb vent - or how about some dumb jazz standards?

A flyer with FAQ's explains that it is a legit coffee house and is completely legal thanks to 'parody law' being on its side (also known as 'fair use') that would allow it to skirt trademarks.

'Although we are a fully functioning coffee shop, for legal reasons Dumb Starbucks needs to be categorize as a work of parody art. So, in the eyes of the law, our 'coffee shop' is actually an art gallery and the 'coffee' you’re buying is considered the art. But that’s for our lawyers to worry about. All you need to do is enjoy our delicious coffee!'

People have been lining up for Dumb Coffee for up to an hour just to get their hands on a cup — part novelty, part collector’s item.

When you reach the front of the line you can order a Dumb Venti or perhaps take home a CD of Dumb Jazz Standards or perhaps some Dumb Norah Jones Duets.

FAQs: There are plenty of questions. Is it legal? Probably not!

Dumb people: People waited in line for an hour this weekend for coffee that wasn't very good either. However, it was free

Dumb Starbucks are justifying their cafe by saying that their store is a 'parody' and therefore protected by freedom of speech legislation.

Under such law, certain parodies of trademarks may be permissible if they are not too directly tied to commercial use.

In this case, the cafe isn't charging for the drinks it is providing and can therefore argue that their pop-up shop is not for commercial gain.

The basic idea here is that the artistic and editorial parodies of trademarks serve a valuable critical function and is entitled to some degree of First Amendment protection.

Of course, Starbucks' own lawyers will likely argue that this 'store' is damaging their carefully guarded brand, image and reputation.

It may very well end up that the people behind Dumb Starbucks will be the ones left feeling dumb.

All of the coffee, brewed by two baristas, is free. There's a Dumb Starbucks menu, even Dumb Starbucks cups (in Dumb Grande, Dumb Venti and Dumb Tall sizes).

You can also pick up a Dumb Espresso, Dumb Iced Coffee, and Dumb Frappuccinos.

The store, calling itself a legit coffeehouse, features the same logo and look and colors of the famous coffee chain.

The baristas are no wiser as to who is behind the stunt saying that they simply answered a 'help wanted' ad on Craigslist.

Rumors are circulating that it is really a piece of performance art, perhaps for a TV show.

Despite its popularity with lines out the door, customers seemed confused about what exactly was going on.

'I saw online that there was a Dumb Starbucks sign. One of my friends posted about it, and I live across the street, so I just walked over,' one customer said. He described it as 'weirdly off-kilter.'

The FAQ sheet explains a little more about the existence of the store.

'We
 love Starbucks and look up to them as role models. Unfortunately, the 
only way to use their intellectual property under fair use is if we are 
making fun of them. So the word 'dumb' comes out of necessity, not 
enmity.'

Strangely familiar: The place looked like a regular Starbucks, only with the word 'Dumb' everywhere

Collectors piece: Part of the attraction was the specially made logo cups

Dumb Starbucks has a Twitter account at @dumbstarbucks, and even local fans like The Office’s Rainn Wilson are posting pictures.

One person joked that you should get there 'before dumb lawyers get to it.'

Starbucks is notorious for defending its trademark.

The real Starbucks has confirmed that the store isn't one of theirs and is looking into the matter.

You can find the Dumb Starbucks at 1802 Hillhurst Avenue in Los Feliz ...for now.

Grab it while you can: The real Starbucks are looking into this store, so it may not last for long!
