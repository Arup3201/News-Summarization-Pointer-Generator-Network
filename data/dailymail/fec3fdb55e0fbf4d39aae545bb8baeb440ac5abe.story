A Florida couple was arrested this week after using forged documents to back up their fraudulent claim to a million dollar home where they squatted with nothing but a pool table for furniture, police say.

Justin, 24, and Jenna Dean, 23, allegedly moved into a 7,000-square-foot home in Keystone Heights, Florida after claiming they'd purchased the foreclosed property for $1,000.

Police caught wind of the Deans' dishonest digs in September, police say, after another couple lawfully purchased the home for $1.1million and found it already occupied.

Nabbed: Jenna, 23, and Justin Dean, 24, were arrested December 8 after police say they forged bank documents in order to squat illegally in a foreclosed $1million Keystone Heights, Florida home

Bad timing: The home had been foreclosed sine 2011, and the Deans may have gotten away with the fraud for longer, police say, but they happened to move in less than a month before an Ohio couple finally decided to buy the home legitimately

Clay County police say the couple removed the home's existing locks and replaced them with their own when they moved in, First Coast News reports.

Authorities say the young couple, who'd recently had a baby, then began to boast about their property on Facebook, where they posted photos of themselves in the pool.

'There were pictures of them in the pool on social media,' said Clay County deputy Steven Dugger told FCN. 'The only furniture in the house was a pool table.'

Investigators say Jenna wrote on her Facebook:

'This is the house we just bought. We have a lot of work to do, it'll take some time but Rome wasn't built overnight.'

When a friend of the couple's admired their palatial new pad on Facebook and asked how they snagged such a find, Dean said it just takes time...and skill.

'Takes years of looking and harassing banks about their foreclosures,' Dean said, in a response dug up by Jacksonville.com. 'I should start my own business.'  

Sometime in September, the property manager removed the new locks and replaced them. However, they soon discovered the locks changed a second time.

When the bank that owned the home told authorities the Deans did not own it, investigators showed up. 

The Deans graciously gave them a tour and showed them a cell phone photo of a quit claim deed -- a document used to transfer property from one party to another quickly but with little legal security.

Not a care in the world: Police say the couple even snapped themselves enjoying the pool and posted the photo to Facebook

Not the sharpest: Police say the fraud was discovered after the home was purchased along with the 200 acres on which it sits. The Deans had allegedly changed the locks twice and even gave police a tour at one point after forwarding authorities a copy of their supposed deed--which police say was photoshopped together from forms with different fonts and bore a September 1 date--which was Labor Day, when banks were closed 

'Leaving the state': The couple had reportedly spent the last two years running a horse shoeing service called J.D. Farrier Services. A Facebook account for the business gave a suspicious and hurried farewell to customers on December 1,  just a week before the Deans turned themselves in

While the home had languished in foreclosure since 2011 unpurchased, the Deans chose the wrong time to pretend they bought it.

Less than a month after their allegedly faked documents say the Deans bought the house, an Ohio couple bought it for real.

Investigators looked into the Deans' deed and found they had forged both bank signatures and a notary seal, police say.

'The quit claim deed that was filed was fraudulent; it was made up of pieces of other deeds where the signatures were on the correct deed and used on the other deed,' Dugger told WJAX.

Dugger also said the fonts on the assembled documents didn't even match. 

Justin and Jenna were turned themselves in to authorities on charges of December 8. 

Jacksonville.com reports that the couple had spent the last two years running a horse shoeing service called J.D. Farrier Services. 

A Facebook account for the business gave a suspicious and hurried farewell to customers just a week before the Deans turned themselves in. 

'With great happiness and sadness, I will no longer being shoeing/trimming horses in Florida,' Justin Dean posted. 'I have a job offer out of state that I have accepted.'

They've since been released on bond.
