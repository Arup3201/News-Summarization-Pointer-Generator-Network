A couple have received an astonishing anniversary gift after being reunited with their lost dog more than three months after he vanished.

Roger Cooper received a call on Tuesday morning from the Michigan Animal Cruelty Society to say that his beloved pet Kobe had been found wandering streets in Detroit.

Staff had matched the three-year-old dog's image with those on missing posters that Cooper and his family had handed out after the animal ran off during a fireworks display on June 25.

Joy: Roger Cooper grins as he is reunited with his dog, Kobe, who vanished more than three months ago

Happy to be home: Kobe was found wandering the streets of Detroit this week and taken to a shelter

'I'm ecstatic. It's my two year anniversary,' Cooper told Local 4 in Detroit, adding that he was going to present the dog to his wife, saying: 'Happy anniversary!'

The news station captured the moment Kobe bounded up to Mr Cooper and his daughter, Tamia, as they were reunited after months apart.

Kobe had vanished amid a scuffle in downtown Detroit following the fireworks. As the display got under way, people believed they heard gunshots and started to run.

In the chaos, Mr Cooper was trampled and injured his arm, and his dog ran off.

The family shared his image and appeared on local news channels to spread the word that he was missing - but they received no tips to his whereabouts.

Excitement: Kobe greets his owners on Tuesday - which just happens to be their wedding anniversary

Panic: He had been separated from his owners during a fireworks show in June when people stampeded through the streets after thinking they had heard gunfire. Mr Cooper was also injured

Found: Kobe was matched with his owners after staff compared him to images on missing pets photos

When Kobe was found by a passerby earlier this week, his fur was matted and dirty, and the shelter suggested he may have been walking continuously in a bid to reach the family's home.

The person who found him took him to the shelter, and staff matched him to images on the wall; they keep flyers from anyone looking for a missing pet.

The Cooper family said they will now get Kobe microchipped so that he can be located if they ever lose him again. The microchip, which costs $25, will be placed under his skin.
