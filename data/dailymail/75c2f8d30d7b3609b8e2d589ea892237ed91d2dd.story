Ashley Cole had a night to forget as his Roma side shipped five goals in the first-half against Bayern Munich - prompting the former England left back to be hooked at half-time.

Roma eventually went on to be humiliated 7-1 by Pep Guardiola's men at the Stadio Olimpico in the Champions League, with Cole having been withdrawn from the action with the score at 5-0.

Cole's former Chelsea team-mate Arjen Robben - who scored twice - gave him a torrid 45 minutes, prompting Roma boss Rudi Garcia to substitute the full back at the interval.

Bayern's first goal in particular will not make for pleasant watching should Cole decide to view a tape of the game, as Robben jinked inside and out, leaving the ex-Arsenal defender trailing in his wake.

Having easily ghosted past Cole's lame efforts to challenge for the ball, Robben then curled an exquisite left-footed shot around the goalkeeper and into the net from a tight angle. 

Cole, 33, who won two Premier League titles with Arsenal and one with Chelsea during 15 years in England's top division, was making his sixth appearance of the season.

But he will hope he that his early withdrawal will not prevent him from being selected for Roma's trip to Sampdoria on Saturday where he will aim to put in a far stronger performance.

'The only good news tonight came from City and CSKA (Moscow), which allowed us to stay second in the group,' said Garcia, who believes his side should have defended deeper but he took responsibility for the defeat himself.

'Tonight they were better than us. We were spectators.

'It shows us we have a way to go to reach the level of the world's top squads.'
