Tomas Berdych and his model girlfriend Ester Satorova have announced the news of their engagement ahead of upcoming Australian Open match against Jurgen Melzer.

The men's seventh seed, Berdych and the Czech model  began dating in the autumn of 2012 after his long-time relationship with WTA player Lucie Safarova ended. 

Clearly excited about the news, TV presenter and model Rachael Finch, who interviewed the duo for Australia's Channel Seven, shared the news on her Instagram page along with a shot of a gondola.

She wrote: 'Botanical Gardens, Melbourne where I just interviewed Tomas Berdych and Ester Satorova to announce their engagement! Congratulations to the glowing couple!'

The Australian Open Twitter page also shared the news stating: 'Love and love' along with a picture of the two making their announcement.

An earlier tweet on their page read: 'Is that the sound of wedding bells we hear? Congrats, they're getting married everyone.'

Satorova looked her usual perfectly groomed self wearing a pair of gold loafers with white cut-off shorts and a chic light pink blouse.

Her fiancé sported a very big grin as he walked along in casual black jeans and T-shirt.

The couple were all smiles after publicly announcing they were engaged

Speaking about dating a non-tennis pro last year, Berdych said: ‘Actually, yes, I see a big difference.

'I mean, in the past I was saying that it's probably the best thing just that we are both from the same thing. I didn't have any other experience.

‘But now I can say that this one is way better because, you know, I think it was too much tennis. 

'If you do it like myself, and I'm dealing with everyday work that you have to play, practise, organise this stuff, then winning, losing, handle this situation, it's quite tough to have it from one side. 

'If you have to deal with the same thing from the other side, it was quite too much.

He added: 'So I'm really enjoying that, that it's different, that I met somebody with a different life. It's a nice experience.’
