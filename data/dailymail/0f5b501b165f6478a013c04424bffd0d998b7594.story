At least half a dozen Conservative Cabinet ministers would opt for Britain to leave the EU on the current terms of membership, senior party sources claim.

The mood at the top of the party has hardened ahead of David Cameron’s proposed negotiation of looser ties with Brussels, followed by an in/out referendum by 2017 if he remains in power after the next election.

Three ministers – Philip Hammond, Michael Gove and Oliver Letwin – have suggested publicly that they would back an exit unless significant changes can be secured. At least three others are understood to be of a similar view.

Former Environment Secretary Owen Paterson yesterday insisted Britain should invoke the nuclear option of setting itself on course for an EU exit.

Warning Conservative MPs who defect to Ukip are ‘stupid’, since they undermine the one party willing to ‘sort out’ Britain’s relationship with Brussels, Mr Paterson also called on Mr Cameron to develop ‘robust’ policies to win back disaffected Tory voters.

The MP, who is emerging as a leader of the Tory Right having been sacked by the Prime Minister in the summer, suggested that the party’s election manifesto should significantly harden its position on Europe.

In a speech in London, the former Environment Secretary suggested that Britain invokes Article 50 of the Lisbon Treaty signed by the last Labour government - the mechanism for an EU exit.

That would legally compel the EU to negotiate the terms of British exit within two years - preventing the foot-dragging and obstruction in Brussels that is otherwise likely as Mr Cameron seeks to negotiate looser ties.

David Cameron has been reluctant to say that he would recommend an ‘out’ vote in the referendum if he does not get what he wants when trying to claw back powers

Mr Paterson said he favoured a Norway-style agreement with the EU that would allow the UK access to the single market but remove it from the ‘political project’ in Brussels.

It is not so much that we are leaving the EU, as much as the political project of the EU has left us,’ he said.

He insisted Britain had come to a ‘fork in the road’ in its relationship with the EU, adding: ‘To sort out the nightmare of the euro, they have got to form a cohesive, effective new state.

‘And meanwhile, we withdraw from the political arrangements and we concentrate on trade, which gives us an opportunity to get our seat back on the supra-national bodies which actually decide regulation affecting virtually every business in this country.’

Mr Paterson said a ‘significant’ number of Conservative MPs and the majority of activists would now favour an EU exit unless significant changes can be achieved.

But he insisted defecting to Ukip was counterproductive.

‘It would be very unwise if any others do go, most unwise. What is clear is that if you defect you don’t get the referendum, so if you are very keen on a referendum as a Conservative party backbencher you are very stupid to go and defect,’ he said.

Mr Paterson called on fellow Eurosceptics to make a more compelling case for Britain’s prospects outside the EU - predicting that if an in/out referendum were held today, voters would choose to stay in.

‘Voters have not been presented with a clear vision of what life outside the EU would look like for the UK and in the absence of any detail I am convinced that if an “in-out” referendum were held today, there would be a natural tendency to vote for the status quo,’ he said.

‘The establishment view will be clearly to stay within the political organisation of the EU.

‘The answer to this is to invoke Article 50 of the Lisbon Treaty. It is the only legally binding mechanism that we can use to require the rest of the EU to enter formal negotiations with us, on setting out a new relationship,’ Mr Paterson said.

Mr Paterson said he favoured a Norway-style agreement with the EU that would allow the UK access to the single market but remove it from the ‘political project’ in Brussels

Following the second Tory byelection defeat to Ukip last week, Mr Cameron is facing calls from some Eurosceptic Tories to toughen his position on a potential British exit from the EU.

The Prime Minister will use a speech expected within the next ten days to flesh out details of his aim to limit the numbers of EU migrants, get Britain out of the EU’s founding goal of ‘ever closer union’ and allow small groups of national parliaments to block unwanted European legislation.

Downing Street sources were cool about Mr Paterson’s proposal, pointing out using Article 50 would set Britain on course for exit, pre-empting the planned referendum.

‘The whole point is the British people should decide – not Westminster or the Government,’ said one.

Unlike Labour, the Conservatives are committed to giving voters the choice in an in/out referendum on membership by the end of the 2017 after attempting to rengotiate a looser, more trade-based relationship for the UK with the Continent.

But Mr Cameron has been reluctant to say that he would recommend an ‘out’ vote in the referendum if he does not get what he wants when trying to claw back powers.

Labour leader Ed Miliband reiterated that Britain would not leave the EU if Labour wins May’s election.

He said: ‘I’m afraid the Conservative Party, again today, are a party sleepwalking towards the exit door of the European Union.’ He added that such a move would be ‘bad for jobs, bad for investment, bad for businesses’.
