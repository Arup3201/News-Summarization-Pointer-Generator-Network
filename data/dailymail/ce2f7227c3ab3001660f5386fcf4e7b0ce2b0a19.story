It’s not the most popular sport in America but an Englishman is showing the Yanks the way when it comes to scoring in the Major League Soccer (MLS).

Dom Dwyer is the league’s second-leading scorer having hit the back of the net 14 times in 19 games for Sporting Kansas City. His 68 shots are the most in the league.

It’s a long way from Cuckfield, the large village in West Sussex, where he was born and Norwich City, the East Anglian club he joined as an aspiring nine-year-old in 1999.

However, he never progressed to the first team and broke his foot four times. It seemed all over until he was offered the chance to move to America four years ago.

He won two national championships at Tyler Junior College and in his second season he was named national junior college player of the year.

Dwyer spent one season at South Florida in the first division before being signed by Sporting Kansas City and then immediately loaned out to Orlando City.

In 13 games he netted 15 times, setting the league's single-season goal scoring record, before being recalled by his parent club.

He now has his sights on Kansas City's season record goal tally, which stands at 18.

It could be the start of an international career for Dyer as in 2017, the year before the next World Cup, he becomes eligible to apply for US citizenship.

He plays alongside World Cup stalwarts Matt Besler and Graham Zusi at Sporting Kansas City.

However, he has not given up on playing international football for Roy Hodgson’s men.

'Every player wants to play on the international stage,' Dwyer told MLSsoccer.com. 'I think if I were to get called in the future and have an opportunity, I think that's something every player would love to do and dream of.

'If the offer ever came to me, I think it would be a difficult one to say no to,' he says. 'I'm from England, born and raised there, but I've been in the US for quite a few years and have a lot of love for this country and enjoy being here.

'But I don't know where I'll be in 2017. You don't know where you'll be tomorrow. So you have to just kind of take it as it comes, and if the opportunity comes -- I'm not sure if [England manager] Roy Hodgson's going to be calling me any time soon, so we'll just have to wait and see.'
