The rotting corpses of 500 sea lions have washed up on a beach in Peru, prompting accusations that fishermen harvesting shellfish poisoned them. 

Sea lion cubs were among the hundreds of dead bodies found on a bay in Santa province in the north-west of the South American nation, about 250 miles north of the capital Lima.

Police are investigating a complaint made the governor of the local Samanco district, who believes the creatures were poisoned by marine farmers harvesting shellfish.

Sea lions often come close to the shore to look for seafood and scallops to eat, but may have ingested poison while doing so. 

City council workers quickly hauled away the mass of decomposing corpses as they were a public health risk.

The bodies of another 187 sea lions were found in the Piura region of Peru along with four dead dolphins and the corpses of sea turtles and dozens of pelicans earlier this month.

How the animals came to die remains a mystery and wildlife officials are still investigating the deaths. 

Detectives are yet to rule out disease, fishing nets, hunting or eating plastic rubbish disposed of in the Pacific Ocean by humans as possible causes.

In 2012, hundreds more dolphins were founded dead on Peruvian beaches. 

An environmental group blamed the deaths on the noise and waves caused by explosions made by oil exploration nearby.

However, a government report said natural causes, such as an infection, were to blame for their deaths.
