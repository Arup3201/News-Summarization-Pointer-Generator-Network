A French couple has made miniature photography even more creative. And mouth-watering!

Since 2002 Akiko Ida and Pierre Javelle have been shooting a playful series of dioramas called Minimiam (miam is French for ‘yum’) that place miniature people doing day-to-day things in a world of over-sized food.

They arrange miniature model train figurines in everyday positions and situations that involve fruits, vegetables, pastries and sorts of other foods.

Their work is presented by the Madelyn Jordon Fine Art gallery in Scarsdale, New York.

The photo series features little figurines doing things like chipping away at a gigantic peanut, or playing a game of tennis on a watermelon. They are seen trying to pump air into a raisin and even playing golf on a giant doughnut.

Although the main purpose of the images was to make people smile, according to Boredpanda.com, some of them take on issues like global warming and our relationship with nature.

The creative couple met while studying photography at the Arts Decoratifs art school in Paris. 

Bon appetite!
