Police in Pittsburgh have launched a probe into one of its officers after he posed for a picture with a porn star while wearing a unicorn's head.

The offending photograph, posted on 
Twitter, shows the rubber-masked officer posing playfully in the foyer of a 
police station next to laughing adult actress Andy San Dimas.

The cop was caught in the compromising position after San Dimas was thrown out of a Pirates baseball game and arrested for refusing to sit down while performing a sexy dance in the stands.

The 26-year-old pornstar, who has starred in films including Shades of Kink and Lesbian Nanny Tales, was hauled down to the local police station where she was read her rights... but not before persuading one of the duty officers to pose in the silly mask.

She later posted the image on Twitter which instantly went viral as users shared the picture and dubbed the mysterious officer the 'Unicorn Cop'.

'It was funny': Before her arrest, San Dimas had posted a string of photographs of her wearing the mask in and around the Pittsburgh Pirates' home ground during a trip with porn director and producer Steviee Hughes

Acting Pittsburgh Police Chief Regina 
McDonald said in a statement: 'We are aware of the photos on the 
Internet (Facebook) and are currently investigating the incident. 

Porn star: Andy San Dimas is an adult actress who has starred in such films as Breaking Bad XXX and Simpsons: The XXX Parody

'At this time we have not identified the individual or the circumstances surrounding this photo.'

The investigation is understood to to be probing whether the officer's behaviour was appropriate under the circumstances.

Before her arrest, San Dimas had posted a string of photographs of her wearing the mask in and around the Pittsburgh Pirates' home ground during a trip with porn director and producer Steviee Hughes.

But during the game San Dimas, who was in town for a performance in a night club, stood up and danced, shaking her backside in rhythm with the music blaring from the tannoy, while wearing the mask.

Deadspin reported
that when she was asked by an usher to sit down, she replied: 'Oh, I'm 
sorry I was trying to have a good time at the f***ing Pirates game!'

Hughes leapt to the officers defence today after news of the internal police probe surfaced.

'We don’t want him
getting in any trouble because he didn’t do anything wrong,' she told ABC's Channel 4 Action News.

'We took 
(the picture) down because we don't want him to get in any trouble 
because there's no reason he should be in trouble.'

She
said they had been wearing to mask all day, asking other baseball fans 
to wear it, taking pictures and posting them on Twitter.

'[The officers] thought the 
unicorn mask was funny. They all asked if they could put it on and take 
pictures with it. Everybody was just having fun with it, thought it was 
funny. The mask was not the issue at all,' said Hughes.
