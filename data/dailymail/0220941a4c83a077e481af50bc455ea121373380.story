David Cameron will today plead with Greece’s new far-Left leader to end a standoff over his country’s vast debts.

The Prime Minister is due to hold one-on-one talks in Brussels with Alexis Tsipras, whose government is threatening to turn to Russia for help if the Eurozone cuts it adrift.

German finance minister Wolfgang Schaeuble has sent shockwaves through Europe after declaring that if Athens does not continue its aid programme with tough conditions ‘then that’s it’.

‘We have a programme,’ he added. ‘The programme is either brought properly to an end or there is no programme.’

A summit of European leaders is set to be dominated by economic concerns following the victory of the Greek radical anti-austerity party Syriza in elections last month.

British officials said Mr Cameron would be in ‘listening mode’ in his meeting with Mr Tsipras, but wanted an explanation of how he would tackle the crucial issue of Greece’s debts.

‘I expect the Prime Minister to make clear that we expect to see a swift resolution to the current stand-off between Greece and the rest of the Eurozone,’ an official said.

‘The Prime Minister’s point will be this is not about us taking sides, it’s down to Greece and Eurozone partners to agree on the best way to move forward to get the Greek economy growing, to bring their debt down and get it on a sustainable footing.

‘They need to work on this together but they need to be acting responsibly and coming up with a plan for growth.

‘The point from the UK perspective is that the uncertainty around Greece is clearly a risk to our economy. We want Greece and Eurozone partners to get on and sort this out.;

German Finance Minister Wolfgang Schaeuble warned Greece against abandoning the current economic plan

Yesterday, the Greek government presented its demands at an emergency meeting of Eurozone finance ministers in Brussels.

It wants to overhaul 30 per cent of its bailout obligations, but EU ministers insist it must stick to the existing terms.

The Greek government wants a ‘bridging loan’ lasting till August rather than the next stage of its bailout from the Eurozone, which is conditional on continuing with spending cuts.

Mr Tsipras insists Athens has no intention of requesting an extension of its 240 billion euro EU/IMF rescue package and is intent on reversing what he has called ‘cruel’ austerity imposed by foreign creditors.

The think tank Open Europe said the standoff means the chances of Greece exiting the euro are now around 40 per cent, higher than at the height of the Eurozone crisis in 2012.

David Cameron and George Osborne have asked the Bank of England and Treasury to make contingency plans for such an outcome.

The impasse risks leaving Greece without funding as of the end of this month, when its current bailout expires.

Russia’s Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov, who met his new Greek counterpart Nikolaos Kotzias in Moscow yesterday, said he would consider any request for financial aid from Athens.

Greek Defence Minister, Panos Kammenos, said Greece might seek funding from Russia or China unless the Eurozone gives ground.
