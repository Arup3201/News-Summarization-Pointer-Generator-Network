Most dog owners are proud if their canine companion can fetch a ball.

But Jiff the pomeranian puts their skills to shame as he has been named the world’s fastest dog on two paws.

The talented pet who lives in Los Angeles can run 32 feet (10 metres) on his hind legs in 6.56 seconds.

And he takes just 7.76 seconds to dash 16 feet (5 metres) on his front paws in a deft display of doggy agility.

To achieve this feat, Jiff practices running on his front and hind legs daily.

His record-breaking achievements are the first to be revealed from the latest Guinness World Records annual released in September.

To set the new records he had to complete both distances in under 10 seconds, which he managed on his first attempt.

Not content with this accomplishment, the dog is also able to shake hands, bow, ride a skateboard and even stamp his own autograph.

In the past year, Jiff has become an internet sensation, with legions of fans on Facebook, Instagram, Twitter and YouTube and has even starred in a Katy Perry music video as well as in TV adverts.

Guinness World Records Editor-in-Chief, Craig Glenday, said: ‘When Jiff first walked into our offices, we weren't even sure he was real.

‘He looks like a living, breathing cuddly toy. He might be tiny but he's got a huge personality, and his wealth of talents can't be doubted.

‘He certainly deserves his place in the new Guinness World Records book, which is particularly special this year because it marks our 60th anniversary.

‘Jiff is just one of the many incredible new record holders in the book, and the first of many special announcements we'll be making.’

The book will feature augmented reality technology that enables the reader to bring record-breakers to life in 3D. It will go on sale on September 11 for £20.

Jiff's owners have asked to remain anonymous, so they don’t draw attention away from their celebrity dog.
