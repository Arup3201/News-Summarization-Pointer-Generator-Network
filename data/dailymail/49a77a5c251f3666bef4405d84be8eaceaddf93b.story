Joyce Sale was hit with a £70 fine after stopping her car outside a school for just seven seconds

A grandmother of six was hit with a £70 fine by her local council after stopping her car outside a school for just seven seconds.

Charity worker Joyce Sale, 71, from Birmingham, West Midlands pulled up on zig-zag lines outside a school in the city as she searched for a parking space.

She has been left furious after her seven-second stop led to her being filmed by a nearby CCTV van and sent a parking fine.

Mrs Sale, who does charity work for the Birmingham St George's Day Association, had been trying to drop leaflets off at St Benedict's School to promote a musical event.

She didn't even turn her engine off or get out of the car as she peered past the school gates through her driver-side window.

She said: 'I had barely stopped the car. It was pouring with rain and I was just looking to see if there was somewhere to park on the school grounds.

'I am responsible driver, and because it was pouring down with rain I just wanted to have a look and see if there was anywhere I could park.

'A passerby kindly tapped on my window to notify me that a council van was filming me, so I waved and then moved on.

'It was all over in a few seconds - and now I've been left with a huge bill.

'When I found out I had been fined I was appalled - it's just another way of churning money.'

Mrs Joyce wrote to Birmingham City Council asking for them to waive the fine, but the widow lost her appeal at an independent hearing.

She said: 'It is ridiculous - because I stopped for such a tiny amount of time, I would have hoped the council would have the decency to waive the fine.

A video of the incident taken by the CCTV van shows Mrs Sale's car outside the school at 12:02 and 21 seconds

After looking inside the school gates for a place to park, she then pulls away just seven seconds later

'Anyone can see it is ridiculous and I argued my case because of the principle.

'I will admit that I stopped outside the school, but if you look at the incident as a whole, it is truly unnecessary and ridiculous.

'If people don’t challenge these fines on the principle, what else will the council try and get away with?”

A Birmingham City Council spokesman said: 'Drivers have the right to appeal against any notice they feel is issued unfairly. In this case, that process has been followed and the notice has been upheld. 

'We would also point out that the safety and wellbeing of those travelling to and from schools is paramount and that parking restrictions, including zig-zag lines, are important safety measures.'
