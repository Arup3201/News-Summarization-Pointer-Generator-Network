It is a competition unlikely to be short of entries.

Ice-cream maker Haagen-Dazs is offering fans a chance to win a week’s ‘work experience’ in perhaps one of the world’s most enjoyable jobs – a taste tester.

For ice cream lovers, it would be food heaven. Training will involve plenty of eating and practical tasks include sampling some of the finest Belgium chocolate.

Haagen-Dazs's resident taste tester Alison Gray, 46, says she has found her dream job. ¿It¿s a tough job but someone has to do it and I¿m lucky that it¿s me'

The rare opportunity to enter the 
idyllic yet secretive world of the ice cream taste tester is being 
offered by Haagen-Dazs to celebrate its 50th anniversary.

The winner will join the eight-strong research and development team at the company’s headquarters in France.

Practical tasks include sampling new flavours and some of the world’s finest Belgian chocolate, plus ‘training’ in how to create new ice-cream varieties using ingredients from around the world.

Applicants must write a 200-word entry and will also take part in a ‘taste off’ to judge the receptiveness of their palate.

Alison Gray, head taster at the unit, said: ‘It’s a tough job but someone has to 
do it and I’m lucky that it’s me. I’ve always loved ice cream, even 
before I started working here. It really is a dream job and I have done 
it for 11 years.’

'One-off work experience opportunity: The development team create new flavours across the world each year

Mrs Gray, a Scottish-born 
mother-of-two, said on average she would spend up to 18 months 
developing a new flavour, which is ‘an art form’ in its own right.

But some jobs have proved harder than 
others. She said: ‘We spent over four years searching for the perfect 
chocolate brownie. It was a tough job.’

The rare opportunity to enter the 
idyllic yet secretive world of the ice cream taste tester is being 
offered by Haagen-Dazs to celebrate its 50th anniversary.

Apart from having an obvious ‘passion for ice cream’ no other qualifications or experience is necessary.

On average a taste tester gets through a small pot of ice cream a day in the cause of research. But if that’s not enough then there’s a full freezer of ice cream in the staff canteen available for sampling.

The development team create new flavours across the world each year and the competition winner will be taken on four trips over the course of 2012 as part of the one-off ‘work experience’ opportunity.

But is there the chance of a paid job at the end of it. ‘Who knows, it depends on what you do,’ said Mrs Gray.
