Cross-dresser: Police are hunting Meko Jerran Hartfield, pictured, who they said stole a credit cards from nursing home patients

Police are hunting a cross-dressing nurse who racked up thousands of dollars on credit cards he stole from elderly patients at multiple Florida nursing homes.

Meko Jerran Hartfield, 29, allegedly dressed as a female nurse to blend in with staff at Winter Park Towers assisted living facility so he could steal the credit card, social security card and driver's license from a 92-year-old resident.

He also stole a wallet from an 87-year-old in the Savannah Court assisted living facility in Oviedo, while wearing a female nurse's scrubs and a ladies' wig.

Surveillance footage shows the alleged cross-dressing criminal charging the pilfered cards at stores across Orlando and Altamonte Springs.

He was caught on camera spending a whopping $4,000 on the 87-year-old patient's credit card at a Target store in Orlando.

Police initially fell for Mr Hartfield's disguise, believing him to be a woman, but have since clarified that they are now searching for a man who likes to dress in drag.

'Meko Hartfield is known to cross-dress as a female, wear medical scrub attire, and wear wigs,' a Winter Park Police spokesman said.

Authorities are appealing to the public for information on Mr Hartfield's whereabouts and are also chasing details about an unknown black male who was seen with the suspect at the Target store.

The pair made off in an older model dark colored BMW, police said.

'The subject is targeting Assisted 
Living Facilities where it is easy to blend in with staff members and 
health rehabilitation employees,' the police spokesman added.

Emily
Reyes, whose sister lives in a Florida nursing home, said the string of
thefts made her worried about security at assisted living facilities in
the area.

'They have to have more security at these homes; watch who comes in, make sure they sign in, what time they walk in, what time they leave,' she told Click Orlando.

Orlando resident Andrea Dolce added: 'I would think that you'd have to be very desperate and miserable to be able to take advantage of anybody but especially the elderly.'

It's still unclear whether Mr Hartfield actually works at any of the assisted living facilities that have been targeted. He is also suspected of committing similar offenses at nursing homes across America.
