A multi-billion dollar U.S. company has been found guilty of hiring Mexican workers on well below the minimum wage and paying them in pesos, it was revealed today.

Silicon Valley firm Bloom Energy Corporation paid 14 employees the equivalent of just $2.66 per hour, around a third of the federal minimum hourly rate of $7.25, a U.S. Labor department investigation found.

The clean energy manufacturer, which provides power systems for firms such as Google, Walmart and Coca-Cola, also violated overtime and record-keeping provisions of the Fair Labor Standards Act, a U.S. District judge ruled.

Ruben Ronsalez, a Labor department administrator, said: 'It is appalling that this was happening right in the heart of Silicon Valley, one of the wealthiest per capita areas in the U.S.

'The department remains vigilant in protecting the rights of vulnerable workers and to ensuring they are paid the wages they have rightfully earned.'

The company, which receives tax breaks as a 'clean energy' provider and is worth an estimated $2.7billion, must now pay the Mexican nationals $31,922 in lost wages as well as $6,160 in civil penalties, according to Fox News.

The employees, who were in the U.S. on visitor visas, worked alongside American employees welding and refurbishing generators.

They were housed in hotels and given a $50 stipend for food.

Their wages were deposited into a Mexican account in pesos, according to the Labour department, which launched a two-year investigation in November 2010, but did not reveal why.

As well as the financial penalties, Bloom Energy has been banned from shipping the goods made by the Mexican workers and must publish quarterly reports over the next two years to show they are adhering to legal pay practices.

Bloom Energy, which is based in Sunnyvale, California, has not returned calls requesting comment.
