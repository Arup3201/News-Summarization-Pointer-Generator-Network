Liverpool's strikers have now astonishingly racked up almost 1,000 minutes between them without scoring a Premier League goal this season.

The trio of Mario Balotelli, Rickie Lambert and Fabio Borini are yet to find the back of the net in the league this season, with the Reds currently languishing in 11th position.

Their failure to score in Liverpool's 2-1 defeat by Chelsea on Saturday extends the combined total to 998 minutes.

Liverpool have struggled in front of goal this season following the summer departure of Luis Suarez to Barcelona.

England international Daniel Sturridge has also been sidelined with a thigh injury since September to further compound Brendan Rodgers' woes. 

Balotelli has understandably been the focal point for much of the criticism directed at Liverpool following his £16m summer move to Anfield from AC Milan.

The Italian has started in eight of his nine league appearances this season, while Borini has come on as a substitute in three of his four matches and Lambert in eight of his nine.
