For those in the market for a luxury fairytale manor, you might be in luck.

A historic hotel near Niton on the Isle of Wight, dating back to 1838, has gone on sale for £1.5 million.

Originally home to the Kirkpatrick family - who were friends of the royal family - the manor was turned into a hotel by Ric and Maggie Hilton who bought the property in 2006.

With eleven suites - all of which are decked out in fairtytale style with four-poster beds - the Enchanted Manor is now the stuff of fantasy. 

They bought the property for £750,000 at auction and spent six months turning the ruined Victorian manor house into one of the most individual places to stay in the country.

Coupled with idyllic sea views, the unique five star property on the small island has become a bolthole for couples seeking romantic getaways.

Maggie, who has been in the hotel business for 30 years, said: 'When Ric and I bought the hotel it was completely run down but we had fallen in love with it the moment we had seen it. When we walked through the door the first time, I said to Ric how enchanting the place was and that was it, the idea was lodged in our heads.

'We wanted to create something that was unique and different but still with the five star standard.

Hefty price tag: After running it for eight years Ric and Maggie are selling so they can enjoy more time with their families

'One day I stumbled across the fantasy artwork of Josephine Wall and thought it would be a perfect fit for our hotel so we based all our rooms on her work.

'There's nowhere else like the Enchanted Manor in the UK. It's elegant, not tacky or Disney-like, and it's in a stunning location.

'We have a huge customer base and people come from all over the world to stay with us for the sheer experience and romance we offer.'

Ric, 64, and Maggie, 57, Hilton met in 1998 in Australia

Ric and Maggie met in 1998 Australia. When Maggie had to return to the UK, Ric followed.

They bought a run-down restaurant and transformed it into a Victorian tea room, before buying the Enchanted Manor.

Friends then suggested they buy Windcliffe Manor (as it was known then), a historic hotel which had fallen into ruin.

The manor was where Italian radio pioneer Guglielmo Marconi made his first broadcasts from and the royal family were said to visit when belonged to the Kirkpatrick family.

After running it for eight years Ric, 64, and Maggie, 57, have now listed the hotel for sale so they can enjoy more time with their families in the UK and Australia.

Maggie added: 'It's been a fantastic adventure and it'll be hard to give up the reins but it's the right time for us to sell.

'We're hoping someone will buy it who has the same passion that we do. It needs a special type of person to take it on, and we hope they're out there somewhere.'

The property is being sold through property guru Sarah Beeny's online estate agents Tepilo.
