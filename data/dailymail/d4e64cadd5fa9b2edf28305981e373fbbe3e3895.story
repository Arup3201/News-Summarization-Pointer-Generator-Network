A WOMAN died after accidentally shooting herself in the head while adjusting a gun she kept in her bra holster.

Christina Bond, 55, a former US navy officer, was looking down the barrel of the .22-calibre revolver when she accidentally pulled the trigger and shot herself in the eye.

She was airlifted from her home in St Joseph, Michigan, but died from her injuries in hospital.

Miss Bond, a body builder who won the Miss Michigan Figure Overall Championship in 2013, joined the navy from school. 

The accident happened on New Year’s Day, but police only released the details surrounding the shooting on Wednesday as part of a post-mortem inquiry.

Mark Clapp of St Joseph Police, said: ‘She was having trouble adjusting her bra holster and couldn’t get it to fit the way she wanted it to. 

'She was looking down at it and accidentally discharged the weapon.’

Carrie Lightfoot, owner of the Well Armed Woman store, told the USA Today newspaper that bra holsters were growing in popularity.

Sons: Bond (center) was preceded in death by her two brothers and is survived by her two sons Nicholas Christe (left) and Noah Bond (right)

Elected: Bond was also recently elected as a Republican precinct delegate for St. Joseph Charter Township precinct 1

Facebook: In a post to his Facebook page, Christe, Bond's son, described his mother as God's 'most powerful soldier on earth'

She said: ‘It’s kind of a natural location depending on the size of the gun and the size of the “guns”.

'Women just need options because one day a woman is wearing a dress, the next day a suit and the next day exercise clothing.’ 

She was preceded in death by her two brothers and is survived by her two sons Nicholas Christe and Noah Bond. 

In a post to his Facebook page, Christe, Bond's son, described his mother as God's 'most powerful soldier on earth.'

The post reads in part: 'My mother was the strongest person I have ever known. It's in her, that I've become who I am. She gives me strength to stand up for what I believe.'
