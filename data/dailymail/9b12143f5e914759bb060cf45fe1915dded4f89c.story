When a pilot asked Pam Sheldon for permission to land his vintage 1930s plane on her field, the amateur photographer thought it was a perfect opportunity to hone her camera skills.

In fact, the 36-year-old care worker ended up lowering her lens to watch in horror as the Tiger Moth biplane clipped a tree and crash landed in her smallholding in North Wales.

Ms Sheldon's 61-year-old mother, who had joined her daughter to watch the aircraft touch down in the field in Denbighshire, was forced to make a desperate dash for safety after realising the plane was out of control and headed in her direction.

Wreckage: The 1930s plane clipped a tree and crash landed in the spot where the photographer's mother had been standing moments earlier

The pilot had tried to negotiate the plane through the trees when it dawned on him he was flying too fast to land safely on the sloping field.

But one of the aircraft's wings clipped a branch and the unnamed man could only brace himself as the aircraft smashed to the ground on the smallholding outside Eryrys, landing in very spot where Pam Sheldon's mother Marylyn had been standing moments before.

Incredibly the pilot, 47, from Oxfordshire, staggered from the wreckage of the 73-year-old Tiger Moth unharmed. Such planes were used to train pilots in the run up to and during World War Two.

Incredibly, the pilot emerged from the wreckage of the vintage aircraft unscathed

Ms Sheldon - speaking out after an official report into the incident revealed the pilot acknowledged the choice of landing site was 'not a good one' - described the scene as the 'scariest moment in my entire life'.

'I was just so relieved to see that he’d managed to climb out of 
the wreckage, he was as cool as a cucumber and very calm,' she said.

'Not
only that but my mum had been standing pretty much in the exact spot 
just moments before - we were all very lucky.

'From where she was in the 
field, she was the only one who actually saw him get out and switch the 
fuel engine off.

'I have never been so happy to see a total stranger standing up looking fine in all my life,' she added.

Police, fire and ambulance crews raced to the scene following the crash landing, where worked to mop up aviation fuel leaking from the damaged aircraft.

'Scariest moment of my life': Pam Sheldon told of her relief at seeing the pilot emerge from the wrecked plane

Ms Sheldon said: 'The pilot had called at my house early in the morning and asked who owned the land next door because he wanted to ask permission to land his aircraft there.

'I asked him if I could take photographs of him flying above and he took my number and told me he’d text me when he was setting off.

'As a member of a camera club, I thought it would be a great opportunity to practice my skills, and myself and about three others started taking photographs when we heard the buzz and saw him approach the field.

'He did a fly by the field first and then the second time, he flew around again a little lower.

The photographer's mother Marylyn dashed to safety when she realised the vintage aircraft was going to crash

But when he went to land on his third lap, I could see he was trying to fly between two trees, which I knew was going to be tight, but he couldn’t pull upwards because of some power lines.

'All of a sudden, one of the wings clipped a tree and rolled over and crashed onto my field.

'Neighbours must’ve heard the noise because not long afterwards, I heard sirens. I just couldn’t believe it. I never want to witness anything like that ever again,' she added.

Her mother Marylyn said: 'It was a really good view from where I was and I could see him going up and down circling the air and judging his landing.

'Then on the third attempt he seemed to be going in to land.

'When he came towards me I thought that he was never going to make it and he clipped his wing on one of the trees.

'I have never moved so quick in my life - the plane was coming straight towards me.

'When he crashed he must have been about three metres away from me. I was right in his view. His propellers were heading right towards me.

'The pilot was miraculously ok. despite hitting the floor with a right smash. There were bits of plane everywhere - I’d be surprised if it is fixable.

'Once he came out of the plane I went to see if he was okay and my daughter Pam was shouting for me over the other field to see if I was okay.

'I think I was still in shock because I didn’t feel that upset at that point, but it was that night that I had awful nightmares replaying it in my head again and again.

'I don’t think I will ever be going to watch a plane come to land again after that. If it hit me I don’t think I would be here today.'

An official report by the Department for Transport’s Air Accident Investigation Branch revealed the unnamed pilot was attempting to land at the site for the first time.

It said: 'He obtained permission from the landowner to use the field. The pilot walked it twice on the morning of the accident and was aware it was a difficult landing site approximately 200 yards long.'The field sloped steeply upwards for its first half and less steeply for the second.'

The report added: 'It was evident to him any go-around decision would need to be made in good time and would require careful flying to avoid the wires and trees. The pilot was confident a safe landing could be made.'

An official report following the accident revealed the unidentified pilot had been attempting to land at the site for the first time

The pilot first made a flypast and made an initial approach but this was abandoned because the aircraft was too fast.

The report went on: 'On the second attempt, as the aircraft crossed the hedge, the pilot became aware the aircraft was still too fast to land safely yet too low to climb above the obstacles at the far end.

'The main wheels touched down at the top of the steeply sloping section.

'The pilot opened the throttle to maintain flying speed and fly between the trees. Concentrating on flying through the gap between the fence and the wires the aircraft’s right wing tip struck branches of a tree.

'The pilot ducked and protected his head. He was aware only of a rolling sensation until the aircraft came to a stop.'

The report noted he observed the choice of landing site was 'not a good one'.
