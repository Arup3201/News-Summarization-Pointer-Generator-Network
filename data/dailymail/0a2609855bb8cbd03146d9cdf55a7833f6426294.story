 A 33-year-old Michigan mother has been charged for allowing her nine-year-old son to drive the family car with a five-year-old passenger. Leah Michele Jaglowski of Green Oak Township was arraigned on Monday on charges of allowing an unlicensed minor to drive a vehicle and contributing to the delinquency of a minor.Police were called to the University Mobile Estates development in Whitmore Lake after resident Gloria Vaughn spotted a very young-looking driver operating a vehicle.

Taking out the trash: Jaglowski allowed her young son to drive the family's garbage to a nearby dumpster

'I’m looking in the back, you know, for a parent or anything or an adult and there’s a little four-year-old in the passenger seat,” Vaughn told UPI.

'I’m going, "Where’s your mom?"'

Jaglowski's nine-year old son advised Vaughn that he was taking out the garbage, and that his mother was aware he was driving the car.

Vaughn contacted authorities after getting into a heated exchange with Jaglowski.

'If she would have been at least decent and said I’m so sorry, he took the keys… but she didn’t,' Vaughn told UPI.

Driven to it: Leah Michele Jaglowski faces a possible 90-day jail term for allowing her nine-year-old son to drive her car

'She said he can do it, he can drive so therefore he can. This is wrong. If you won't at least address this and tell him this is wrong, maybe an adult has to.'

According to police, the boy also had a five-year-old passenger in the car.

The Livingston Daily reports that Jaglowski admitted to police that she knew her son was driving the 2002 Mercury Sable but denied knowing the boy had a passenger.

Jaglowski was arraigned Monday and is free on a $1,000 bond.

She returns to court November 19 for a pretrial hearing and could face up to 90 days in jail.
