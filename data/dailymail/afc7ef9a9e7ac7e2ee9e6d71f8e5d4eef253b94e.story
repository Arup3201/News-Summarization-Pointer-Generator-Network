Louis van Gaal hasn't had the ideal start to life as Manchester United manager, having watched his new side pick up just 16 points from 11 games while racking up a disastrous number of injuries.

The Dutchman is now sweating on the fitness of a whopping 12 players ahead of Saturday's Premier League clash against Arsenal. 

Daley Blind is definitely out along with fellow summer signings Marcos Rojo (shoulder), while Radamel Falcao (calf) is struggling.

United could be handed a boost with the news David de Gea might play against Arsenal

Daley Blind: Suspected knee injury

David de Gea: Finger injury

Michael Carrick: Groin/Pelvis injury

Angel di Maria: Ankle injury

Luke Shaw: Hamstring injury 

Marcos Rojo: Dislocated shoulder

Rafael: Muscular injury

Ashley Young: Groin/Pelvis injury

Phil Jones: Calf/Shin injury

Radamel Falcao: Calf/Shin injury

Jonny Evans: Ankle/Foot injury

Jesse Lingard: Knee injury

Goalkeeper David de Gea, who dislocated a finger while on international duty with Spain, is a doubt but there is hope he could be fit.

Van Gaal must have also feared his injury curse had struck again at Old Trafford after record signing Angel di Maria was asked to play on having been stamped on by Nani during a friendly between Argentina and Portugal.

With the United manager watching anxiously from the stands, Argentina surprisingly asked Di Maria to continue after he had finally got to his feet after being stricken for a couple of minutes.

Unbelievably, United have now had 39 injuries since Van Gaal took over the reins at the Premier League outfit in the summer.

He has been particularly hard hit at the back. 

Costly injuries to centre halves Phil Jones and Jonny Evans, plus the recent suspension of Chris Smalling and the shoulder problem for stand-in Rojo have hampered United's hopes of challenging in the Premier League.

The good news for United fans is that as many as four first team members are expected to return to action this weekend.

Defensive duo Jones (shin splints) and Evans (ankle) could be in contention for a squad place while Falcao may also return after a two-week break during the international fortnight.

Meanwhile,sources close to the Spain team toldSportsmail on Tuesday evening that De Gea has ‘an 80 per cent’ chance of making the starting line-up when his club return to Barclays Premier League action this weekend.

Van Gaal will certainly be hoping he can patch his side together in time for Arsenal on Saturday.
