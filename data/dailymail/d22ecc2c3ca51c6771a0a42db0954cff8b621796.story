A derelict Victorian-style terrace complete with 70 years of clutter, broken floorboards and holes in the ceiling has sold for almost $1 million.

The two-bedroom property on Victoria Street at Waverley in Sydney's east sold at auction on Monday night for $972,000.

The almost uninhabitable property is an original Victorian home that had been in the same family since 1954, the Sydney Morning Herald reports.

'The investor was a Chinese woman called Vicki and she bought it on the 8th, the house is number 68 and the street name is Victoria Street so she just said to me "this is my house",' agent Sam Towndrow of Laing+Simmons Woollahra said.

Photos of the property prior to sale showed piles of rubbish in every room, dirt-ridden kitchen appliances, old doors and broken lampshades piled high and bills and old newspaper clippings pinned to the walls.

Mr Towndrow said the squalid property at Waverley was one of a chain of rundown homes that he had sold in recent months.

Once renovated, the Victoria Street property could sell for $1.25 million, with many investors drawn in by the potential capital gains, according to the agent. 

The terrace features two bedrooms, one bathroom and separate living, dining and kitchen areas.

It offers easy access to Bronte Beach and Queens and Centennial Park.
