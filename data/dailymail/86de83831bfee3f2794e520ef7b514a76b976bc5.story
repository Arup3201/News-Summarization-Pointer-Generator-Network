The Peach State is poised to become a petri-dish for the nation's most ambitious gun-rights experiment, following Gov. Nathan Deal's signing of a law that will permit concealed-carry permit holders to keep their weapons as they enter non-secure areas of airports, along with some churches and bars, and most government buildings.

Lawmakers, which passed the bill by wide bipartisan margins in he waning hours of the year's legislative session, notably excluded the state capitol where they work from the list of places where pre-vetted Georgians can now pack heat without penalty.

Reaction was swift and incendiary. Time magazine called the move 'radical.' Americans for Responsible Solutions, the anti-gun group founded by former Arizona Rep. Gabby Giffords, said it's 'the most extreme gun bill in America.' Even the Georgia Association of Chiefs of Police blasted it, with executive director Frank Rotondo saying officers 'do not want more people carrying guns on the street, particularly police officers in inner city areas.'

Conservative's paradise: Georgia is among the U.S. states where gun control legislation has the toughest time advancing

And a 
Georgia Democratic congressman told MailOnline that 'schools, churches, 
public buildings, and airports' are among the 'places you shouldn't be 
allowed to carry a gun.'

'We
 need to have limits,' insisted Rep. Hank Johnson. 'I'm opposed to 
indiscriminate, wild-wild-west laws that put no limits on people's right
 to carry a firearm.'

Democratic state Rep. Mickey Stephens told The New York Times that it 'makes us the laughingstock of the nation because it’s a silly bill.'

'I want to know what kind of religion these guys practice that they have to carry a gun to church.'

But Republican state Rep. Rick Jasperse, who sponsored the bill, said Georgians should be allowed to carry guns in more places.

'When we limit a Georgian's ability to carry a weapon – to defend themselves – we're empowering the bad guys,' he said.

Second Amendment Foundation founder Alan Gottlieb told MailOnline that the move will set the bar for other states.

'You will see other states start to adopt this concept and it will spread across America,' he predicted.

And Cam Edwards, the affable Virginian who hosts a daily talk show for the National Rifle Association, said it was 'an historic legislative victory for gun owners and grassroots activists throughout the state of Georgia.'

Edwards said pro-gun-rights forces were 'tireless in their efforts to strengthen and secure their right to keep and bear arms in the face of hyperbolic opposition.'

GeorgiaCarry, a state-level organization that may reflect the mood of a quiet majority in the Deep South red state, said 'we got a great bill and this will clear the way for some great improvements in the future.' 

The organization was miffed about two sections of the bill that didn't survive the amendment process. One would have extended concealed-carry rights to college campuses. The other requires churches that want to welcome gun-carrying worshipers to 'opt-in'; the legislation originally required them to 'opt-out.'

'We keep 
marching down the field,' the group said in a statement to its members, 
'and one day, we will get all our rights back. This is the way we lost 
our rights (one step at a time) and this is the way we will get them 
back. There is always next year.'

Insiders at the state capitol told MailOnline that Everytown, the successor organization to Mayors Against Illegal Guns, worked behind the scenes to strip the 'Campus Carry' provision out.

The group declined to comment to MailOnline on the record.

Georgia Democratic Rep. Hank Johnson told MailOnline that letting permit holders carry guns into bars is a recipe for disaster: 'Instead of a fistfight you get a gun battle'

Republican 
Gov. Nathan Deal boasted during Wednesday's bill signing that the law 
'will protect the constitutional rights of Georgians who have gone 
through a background check to legally obtain a Georgia Weapons Carry 
License.'

He said that 'roughly 500,000 Georgia citizens have a permit of this kind, which is approximately 5 percent of our population.'

Critics online quickly dubbed it the 'guns everywhere' law.

Rep. Johnson latched on to the idea of bars becoming shooting galleries for inebriated Georgians.

He said he was outraged at Republicans' move to 'sanction people being able to carry guns into bars where, I think, studies will show you have a lot of fights and disputes that break out.'

'And there are women, and all sorts of things happening,' he added. 'You're increasing the odds of armed confrontation. Instead of a fistfight you get a gun battle. Here comes two drunk people with guns, and innocent citizens standing around? There's no collateral damage in a fistfight.'

Johnson also pointed to legislation he sponsored in November, the Airport Security Act of 2013, which would 'prohibit people other than local law enforcement and Homeland Security employees from carrying guns – concealed or otherwise – in airport terminals, lobbies, baggage claim areas, ticket counters and outside in pick-up and drop-off areas.'

The measure attracted only 14 co-sponsors, all fellow liberal Democrats.

Piers Morgan, the former CNN talk show host whose show was canceled amid a ratings slide caused in part by his frequent anti-firearms sermonizing, vented at Twitter after the Georgia governor's Wednesday bill-signing.

'Beyond parody,' he tweeted. 'America's answer to Aurora/Newtown: GUNS EVERYWHERE.'

Gov. Deal has emphasized that Georgia's sweeping concealed-carry laws apply only to citizens who submit themselves to screening that would otherwise be considered an unconstitutional intrusion.

'The important premise we all should remember is these are people who have their fingerprints taken, their backgrounds checked and they have been licensed to carry a weapon,' he told the Atlanta Journal-Constitution.

'It’s not just someone walking out of the clear blue with none of those background checks. They’ve been subjected to scrutiny of the state.'

Deal is running for re-election in the fall, and hadn't said until late Tuesday whether he would sign the bill.

The political calculation, though, was likely an easy one. The only Democrat prepared to face him in November, state Senator Jason Carter, voted for the law, the Times noted.
