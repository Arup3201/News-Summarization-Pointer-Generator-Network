Britain is in the grip of a ‘deep institutional crisis’ with trust in government, parliament and politicians at an ‘all-time low’, according to an internationally respected survey.

It has led to the UK having one of the lowest political participation rates in the developed world – and even scoring below Palestine and Iraq.

Researchers said other institutions in Britain have suffered a decline in trust including the police, the church, the banks and the media.

The study by The Economist Intelligence Unit measured the health of democracy in 167 countries around the world.

Britain scored relatively healthily for having open and free elections. But its score for the number of people participating in politics – just over six out of ten – was alarmingly low.

The MPs’ expenses scandal, the handling of the Libor-rate rigging by the banks and other controversies were blamed for damaging public trust.

And the researchers warned that the inner-city riots during the summer of 2011 had ‘provided a glimpse of the unpredictable consequences of institutional breakdown’.

Last November, only 15 per cent of the public bothered to take part in elections for police and crime commissioners. Turnout for a string of Parliamentary by-elections has fallen below 50 per cent.

According to the Intelligence Unit, the participation rate in British politics was ranked below all of the major powers in Europe, and a string of nations which were not even considered to have fully functioning democracies. These included Lebanon, Palestine, Iraq, Tunisia and Namibia.

For all categories in the study, which also included civil liberties, the UK was ranked 16th out of 167 countries in 2012, placing it towards the bottom of the 25 nations considered a ‘full democracy’.

But The Economist magazine’s researchers said it would have been lower, had it not been for ‘deteriorating conditions elsewhere’.

These included a loss of democratic accountability in countries hit by the eurozone crisis, which have been forced to take orders from Brussels.

The UK was ranked below the Netherlands (10th), Ireland (13th) and Germany (14th).

In a damning indictment of the political class, the researchers warned that the UK is ‘beset by a deep institutional crisis’.

They said: ‘Problems are reflected across many elements – voter turnout, political party membership, the willingness of citizens to engage in politics and their attitudes towards it. Trust in government, parliament and politicians is at an all-time low.’

The report suggests it is unsurprising that voters are losing faith in politicians. ‘Over the past few years the British public’s mistrust of politicians, and ruling institutions more generally, has had ample cause to deepen, amid a series of scandals ranging from parliamentary expenses and “cash-for-questions” to Libor-fixing and payment protection scams, phone-hacking and police cover-ups,’ it says.

Politicians have faced criticism for failing fully to clean-up their act in the wake of the revelations they had been milking the taxpayer through fraudulent expenses claims and second-home allowances.

And there has been widespread concern among consumer groups at the failure of the Government fully to hold the bankers to account for triggering the financial crash.

The researchers, based in London, also commented on the 2011 riots. ‘The elite reaction to the riots was a warning of what can happen when society’s institutions are no longer clear what they stand for and do not function as they should,’ the report says.

‘The initial failure of the authorities to respond to the breakdown of law and order on the streets of London provided a glimpse of the unpredictable consequences of institutional breakdown.’

The researchers warned of more problems ahead. ‘The gulf between the country’s citizens and the political elite is a cause of concern given the depressed state of the economy, and the gloomy outlook,’ they said.

‘The Coalition is still in the early stages of implementing the deepest sustained period of real-term public spending restraint since 1945.

‘There is a clear risk of escalating resentment among affected groups, particularly if further state support is offered to the deeply unpopular financial sector.’
