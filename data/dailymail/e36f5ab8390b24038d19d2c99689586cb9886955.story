Their furry coats and cute name make it tempting to reach out a hand and give them a pet, but the puss caterpillar is no pussycat.

Scientists in Florida are warning anyone who sees a puss caterpillar to look but under no circumstances to touch.

Beneath the fluffy exterior of the plump, fuzzy little creatures are venomous bristles that cause excruciating pain if touched.

The cute bugs are the most poisonous in Florida, and the toxin in their spines cause worse pain than stings from wasps, jellyfish and scorpians.

They're particularly prevalent at certain times of the year - and one of those times is now. Typically, the caterpillar can be seen in early autumn and spring. 

They live in elms, oaks and sycamore trees and are apt to fall out of trees.

At its largest, the puss caterpillar grows to one inch long and eventually matures into the harmless feathered southern flannel moth. 

If touched, its poisonous bristles break off into the skin causing intense pain and sometimes fever, vomiting and a drop in blood pressure.

Dr. Jeffrey Bernstein, the director of the Florida Poison Information Center in Miami told the Sun Sentinel that he has seen patients pass out from the pain.

'We don't see any deaths from it, but it is very painful, judging by the number of people that just are out-of-control hysterical when they call,' he said. 

The Poison Center in Tampa recommends placing Scotch tape over the affected area and pulling it off repeatedly to remove the stinging spines from the skin.

Next, apply an ice-pack and then follow a paste of baking soda and water.

In rare cases, patients may need to see a doctor, particularly if they have a history of hay fever, asthma or allergy.
