Manuel Pellegrini says he wants to extend his contract at Manchester City despite uncertainty over his future with the Premier League champions and speculation linking him with a move to Napoli at the end of the season.

City look set to surrender their title to Chelsea and more pressure will be heaped on Pellegrini if they go out of the Champions League by failing to overturn a 2-1 first-leg deficit against Barcelona at the Nou Camp on Wednesday.

Pep Guardiola, Diego Simeone and Carlo Ancelotti have been touted as potential successors, and Pellegrini’s agent Jesus Martinez has responded by suggesting that the 61-year-old Chilean might be interested in taking over from Rafael Benitez at Napoli.

But the City boss insists that he will see out his three-year contract that expires in 15 months’ time and would like to stay even longer.

‘My future is very easy,’ said Pellegrini. ‘I have contract here until June 2016 and I will stay here. If I can extend it I will. When I sign a contract I always try to finish it.

‘If you’re not happy then maybe you try and finish your contract before but I’m very happy here.’

Asked about the prospect of finishing the season empty-handed, Pellegrini added: ‘The analysis of me is not just about one title, but you never know what can happen in the future.’

Pellegrini insisted that the spirit in the City dressing-room remains strong despite reports of a half-time bust-up between captain Vincent Kompany and Fernandinho during the defeat to Liverpool earlier this month.

Kompany was dropped to the bench for last week’s win at home to Leicester and Fernandinho was left out altogether, but Pellegrini confirmed that his skipper is in the squad for Saturday’s trip to Burnley.

‘There isn’t any problem in the dressing-room,’ he said. ‘That happened a lot of days ago. It is normal that in one game that they can a discussion between two players but it was not important for the team. Inside the dressing-room, we don’t have any problems.

‘There was a normal scene, nothing important. I don’t talk about things that were not important and things that happened 20 days ago. If it happened yesterday, maybe I can tell you some things. But 20 days ago, it doesn’t matter. The squad is absolutely together.’
