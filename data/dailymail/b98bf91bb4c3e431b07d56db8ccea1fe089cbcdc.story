Wings spread and talons out, an angry owl was furious that a hawk perched near to its nest and the pair quickly came to blows in a fierce mid-air clash. 

After watching the hungry red-shouldered hawk circle for a meal, the protective barred owl locked eyes with its adversary when it landed. 

Within seconds it had launched itself towards its fellow raptor, battling in mid-air before ripping out feathers with its talons.

Talons out: After watching the hungry red-shouldered hawk circle for a meal, the protective barred owl battled the red-shouldered hawk after it landed near its nest 

Locking eyes with its adversary, the owl lashed out at the hungry hawk near Sarasota, Florida. The dramatic images were captured by photographer Marina Scarr

Clutching the hawk with its talons the owl ripped feathers from the hawk which then retreated empty handed and hungry

Neither bird appeared to be injured in the fight, Scarr said 

Photographer Marina Scarr captured the dramatic bird battle in her hometown of Sarasota in Florida.

'Every winter a pair of barred owls nest near my friend's home,' she said. 'I was photographing one of the pair when a red-shouldered hawk appeared and perched nearby.

'The owl instantly locked eyes with the hawk and I sensed trouble, preparing myself for action by quickly switching to a shorter lens. Within seconds the owl attacked the hawk that had been peacefully perched nearby.'

Although the owl came away with talons of hawk feathers, she added that neither bird was harmed by the fight. The hungry hawk left empty handed after the fight.

'After the fact I realised it was nesting season for these owls and they must have had eggs or owlets nearby,' she said, adding that her experience of growing up as an avid birdwatcher had helped her capture the fight.

She said: 'It's important as a photographer to study your subjects and their behaviour while in the field. It helps to make you better equipped to anticipate action such as this.'
