Rumours about an Apple streaming service have been around for years, but they ramped up last year when the firm bought Dr Dre’s Beats brand.

And it now seems we’re just months away from seeing the service being rolled out across iPhones and iPads.

Sources told 9to5Mac that Apple is planning to integrate a Beats-powered service into its iOS software and could unveil the changes at this year’s World Wide Developer’s Conference in June.

Sources told 9to5Mac that the Californian firm's service will be integrated into music libraries and users will be able to search, stream and add songs to their iTunes account. It is thought the service will borrow features from the Beats Music app (pictured), such as Mixes and Playlists, but will be a standalone product

The claims were made by multiple, but unnamed, sources from ‘within Apple and the music industry’.

They said Apple will integrate Beats technology into iOS, iTunes and Apple TV using a modified version of the firm’s current Music app.

It is thought the service will borrow features from the Beats Music app, such as Mixes and Playlists, but will be a standalone product.

Reports continued that the service will link with a user’s music library and people will be able to search for songs in the iTunes and Beats catalogue.

Apple bought the Beats brand from Dr Dre last year. Reports said its streaming service will include songs from the iTunes and Beats catalogue. There are even rumours Apple will add social networking features in which people can follow artists, for example

Rumours about a streaming service surfaced in 2013 when Apple held talks with  Dr Dre.

Reports of a bundled subscription service then originated in November.

At that time, sources said the streaming service would launch as early as March, but this is now said to have been delayed. 

Apple has previously announced updates to its music range, such as iTunes Radio in 2013, at its annual developer’s conference and it may instead unveil the streaming service at this year’s event, likely to take place in June.

Sources told 9to5Mac that Apple's service will be integrated into music libraries and users will be able to search, stream and add songs to their iTunes account.

It will include a number of Beats Music’s current features such as Mixes and Playlists and prices are expected to start at $7.99 a month - making it cheaper than Spotify and Rdio’s $9.99 monthly subscription fee. 

From there, they will be able to stream or buy a song, which will be added to their iTunes account either stored on their phones, or kept in the cloud.

There are even rumours Apple will add social networking features in which people can follow artists, for example.

Beats Music costs $9.99 a month, which puts it on par with the likes of Spotify and Rdio, but an Apple service could undercut this price.

9to5Mac said Apple had initially discussed charging $5, but it’s more likely to charge $7.99 per month.

Elsewhere, a version of the service could also be made available for Android phones. 

Beats Music is already available on Android devices.

Reports of a bundled subscription service originated in the Financial Times in November.
