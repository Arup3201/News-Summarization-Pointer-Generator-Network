Black cab drivers have warned they are planning more go-slow protests despite action giving the Uber app £100million of free publicity.

This week commuters in central London faced gridlock after taxi drivers staged a major protest over the introduction of cut-price fare app Uber.

Black cab drivers and licensed taxis converged at Trafalgar Square for the go-slow protest to show their opposition to Uber, an app which allows customers to book and track vehicles.

Black cab drivers have warned they are planning more go-slow protests despite action giving the Uber app £100million of free publicity

Despite the protests, the technology firm behind Uber confirmed a surge in downloads for the app, with a week-on-week increase of 850 per cent.

A spokesman for Uber said it couldn't divulge specific numbers of users before and after the protest because the figures are commercially sensitive.

However, he did say the app surged from number 26 in the iTunes most popular chart on the eve of the protest to number three yesterday, surpassed only by Fifa's World Cup app and Facebook's Messenger service.

However
 Steve McNamara, general secretary of the Licensed Taxi Drivers 
Association, has said there will be more demonstrations in the near future.

He told The Times: 'We will be having more protests. Quite a lot of cabbies enjoyed themselves yesterday.'

However, Ian Stephens, head of Saffron Brand Consultants, said the move had not been properly thought through.

Smartphone app Uber allows customers to book and track vehicles in their area

Uber is one of a number of apps people can use to book and pay for taxi journeys.

Launched in 2009 and currently in operation in more than 70 cities across 37 countries, the app makes cities more accessible for people by ‘seamlessly connecting riders to drivers’, according to the company website.

The app detects the GPS on a mobile device and finds the nearest available driver.

Users can track the vehicle, pay with their phone, and even split the fare with friends using a credit card system.

Its on-demand service means reservations can be booked over the phone and passengers don’t have to wait in line at a taxi rank.

Users can compare rates for different vehicles and get specific fare quotes via the app, before paying for a booking using a debit card or PayPal.

It also allows users to track their driver once a cab has been ordered, so passengers know exactly what time they will be collected and if their taxi has been held up.

It rivals an app already on the market in the UK, called Hailo, which allows passengers to ‘hail’ a cab via their smartphone.

However black cab drivers are angry because they believe Uber effectively allows passengers to hail minicabs, which are supposed to be booked in advance.

'I think it is a massive own goal. Uber have come across has the consumer champion.'

Analysis of social media shows more people opposed the protest than supported it.

Uber has now also launched a new black cab booking feature called UberTaxi in a bid to placate drivers.

As well as London, demonstrations and strikes also took place in other major European cities including Paris, Berlin, Rome and Madrid as international drivers protested against the introduction of the Uber app.

In response to the outcry, Uber confirmed it would add a new section to its app – called UberTaxi – as a compromise with cab drivers.

It would allow users to book 
and pay for a traditional London black cab directly through the app and 
fare rates will be the same as those set out by authorities.

Roads around Trafalgar Square were closed to non-taxis on Wednesday and traffic lined nearby streets around the area during the hour-long demonstration this afternoon.

Protesters chanted
 ‘Boris, Boris, Boris, out, out, out’, while taxi drivers beeped their 
horns and others held large placards.

Many motorists chose to sit on the pavements as they waited for the protest to end.

London Mayor Boris Johnson has said he 
understood the concerns of taxi drivers but added that the issue should 
be resolved in the courts, where Transport for London is planning a 
case.

He said London's black
 cab trade was crucial to the fabric of the city, adding: 'The hackney 
carriage is iconic, and it is absolutely right that our cabbies are 
properly protected.

'Black cab drivers are the face of London not just for Londoners but for millions of visitors to our city.'
