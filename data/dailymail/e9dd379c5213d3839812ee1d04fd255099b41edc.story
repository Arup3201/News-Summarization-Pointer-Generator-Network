A former Connecticut state police trooper, 43, has been charged in the brutal rape of an 81-year-old woman – but his lawyer insists their relations were consensual.

Jeffrey Laporto, a married father of two from Windsor, is facing two counts of first-degree sexual assault and one count of first-degree unlawful restraint.

Police allege Laporto met the victim at a Windsor Locks hotel bar. A conversation that ensued led to both going to her room just after midnight Friday.

'Vile crime': Former Connecticut state police trooper Jeffrey Laporto, 43, is facing two counts of first-degree sexual assault and one count of first-degree unlawful restraint for allegedly raping a 81-year-old woman

Rendezvous: Laporto and the octogenarian met in a bar at Quality Inn on Route 45 in Windsor Locks, Connecticut, Thursday night

The victim’s son called police about two hours later reporting the rape. Police say the octogenarian was taken to hospital for treatment of ‘extensive internal injuries.’

Windsor Locks' police chief described the attack as ‘a sickening crime’ and praised his investigators for arresting Laporto less than 24 hours after the incident.

During his arraignment Monday, Mr Laporto’s attorney, Donald Papcsy, told Judge Kathleen McNamara his client and the alleged victim were seen drinking together in a hotel bar before consensually heading to the woman's room, reported Hartford Courant.

It was revealed during the hearing that the 43-year-old former state trooper is a self-employed real estate agent. Bond Commissioner Paul Maselek said Laporto is being treated for a health issue, which his attorney said was a problem with his back.

Papcsy also said his client is a U.S. Navy veteran who served in both Operation Desert Storm and Operation Desert Shield.

Laporto has no prior criminal record. He was fired from his job as a state trooper three years ago for unspecified reasons. He currently lives in Windsor with his wife and two young daughters.

The alleged rape took place between midnight and 12.30am Friday at Quality Inn on Route 75 in Windsor Locks.

Police were called to the motel by the 81-year-old's son. When responding officers entered the woman's room, they reportedly found her badly injured and in need of medical care.

Detectives were able to determine that the octogenarian and Laporto retired to the woman's room between midnight and 12.30am after having a conversation over drinks in the hotel bar.

Laporto's lawyer insisted in court Monday there was no dispute between the pair at any point during their encounter.

After the arraignment, Mr Papscy told reporters that his client and the elderly woman were adults and there was nothing illegal about their tryst.

‘It’s very common in today’s world to see 80-year-old people with much younger girlfriends and spouses,’ the attorney told the station WFSB, citing disgraced NBA owner Donald Sterling and his 31-year-old girlfriend V. Stiviano as a case in point.

Mr Laporto was released from jail after posting $250,000 bond. He is due back in court June 23.
