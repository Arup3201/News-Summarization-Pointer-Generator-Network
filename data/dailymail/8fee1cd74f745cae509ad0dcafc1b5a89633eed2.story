The parents of a college student who was shot to death 10 years ago are finally breaking their silence and revealing that they believe a SWAT team killed their daughter.

Jim and Susan Positano's daughter Sarah was just a few months shy of graduating from Kent State University in Kent, Ohio when she was taken captive in her apartment by James Earl Trimble.

Trimble eventually agreed to free the 22-year-old after speaking with a hostage negotiator, yet  the Positanos claim that just seconds later their daughter was dead after a 'rogue' SWAT team member entered the apartment and startled Trimble, resulting in him dropping his his gun which went off and killed Sarah.

Now her parents are opening up saying she was shot after a 'rogue' SWAT team member tried to take out her captor, startling him so much he dropped his gun which went off and killed their daughter

'Did Sarah have to die? That’s the question that’s been in my head for all these years,' Jim told the Akron Beacon Journal. 

Jim and his wife have thought about speaking out for years they revealed, and telling everyone how the 'cowboy-like' actions of this one person ended their daughter's life, but have waited until now, 10 years alter.

'I lost the most precious thing to me,' said Jim, 'and I can’t begin to tell you how anyone would get through something like this.'

In 2007 the couple did file a $150million wrongful death suit against the township, former Police Chief David Oliver and the Metro SWAT team, but in 2009 it was thrown out by Common Pleas Judge John Enlow in 2009 in a summary judgment order.

Susan believes that Oliver, along with Portage County Prosecutor Victor V. Vigluicci and Enlow, were 'all in bed together.'

Jim added that he and his wife 'spent a lot of time trying to develop a case that hasn’t worked, and we don’t expect it’s going to work because I don’t think you’re going to beat the government. The government there is controlling the police.' 

Trimble was high on crystal meth the night he took Sarah hostage, having been firing hundreds of shots at cops as he made his way through the woods in the are after murdering his girlfriend, Renee Bauer, 42, and her son, Dakota, 7, on Jan. 21, 2005.

After speaking with a hostage negotiation a little before midnight he finally agreed to Sarah's release.

'He said: "Give me a couple of hours to get my s--- together, and I’ll let her go,"' said Mike Korach of the New Franklin Police Department in his testimony during Trimble's murder trial.

Just moments later, Sarah was dead from a single gunshot wound to her neck.

Trimble has maintained that he was holding his gin and dropped in when the 'rogue' sniper appeared from off the patio and took a shot at him - and even Positano's parents agree with this version of events.

'Trimble dropped the gun, it went off and killed Sarah. He was going for a rifle he had,' said Jim.

And ballistics seem to back up that a second bullet was indeed fired at Trimble, though it missed. 

In fact, at one point, claims Jim, they even found a cop willing to go on record and admit what really happened - and confirm their version of events. 

'I had my investigator go and speak with him. He knew there was a guy in there. He knew everything. He said straight out: "I can prove it." 

But he was too afraid for his family to stand up in court,' said Jim.Now, it isn't about the money or even justice as much as just knowing what happened to their daughter in those final minutes of her life.

'There must be people out there who want to say something, but they’re afraid to,' said Jim.

'Maybe now that the pressure’s off someone will come forward.'

Cops had previously argued that what Trimble saw was a grill on the deck, a claim they backed up by pointing out he had fired eight rounds into  it.

More than other drugs, the use of meth does leave some seeing things that are not really there or confusing inanimate objects for people.
