A spacecraft has spotted evidence of water on the surface of the moon, which scientists believe hints at a secret source buried deep in the rocky body's interior.

'Magmatic water' - liquid that originates from within the moon's interior - was detected by Nasa's Moon Mineralogy Mapper (M3) instrument aboard the Indian Space Research Organization's Chandrayaan-1 spacecraft for the first time from lunar orbit.

The find confirms analyses performed recently on moon rocks brought to Earth by Apollo astronauts four decades ago, researchers said.

Scientists hope the discovery could help them understand how the moon was formed.

The M3 instrument discovered evidence of magmatic water locked in mineral grains on the surface of the moon, having imaged the lunar impact crater Bullialdus, which lies near the lunar equator.

Nasa scientists chose to study this area in particular because they could better quantify the 
amount of water inside the rocks due to the crater's location and the 
type of rocks it holds.

The central peak of the crater is made up
of a type of rock that forms deep within the lunar crust and mantle 
when magma is trapped underground, according to the study, which is published in Nature Geoscience.

'This rock, which normally resides deep beneath the surface, was excavated from the lunar depths by the impact that formed Bullialdus crater,' said Rachel Klima, a planetary geologist at the Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory (APL) in Laurel, Maryland.

'Compared to its surroundings, we found that the central portion of this crater contains a significant amount of hydroxyl - a molecule consisting of one oxygen atom and one hydrogen atom - which is evidence that the rocks in this crater contain water that originated beneath the lunar surface,' she said.

In 2009, M3 provided the first mineralogical map of the lunar surface and discovered water molecules in the polar regions of the moon, thought to be a a thin layer that formed from a solar wind hitting the moon's surface.

However, Bullialdus crater is in a region with an unfavorable environment for solar wind to produce significant amounts of water on the surface.

Simon Pete Worden, centre director at Nasa's Ames Research Centre in Moffett Field, California, said: 'Nasa
missions like Lunar Prospector and the Lunar Crater Observation and 
Sensing Satellite and instruments like M3 have gathered crucial data 
that fundamentally changed our understanding of whether water exists on 
the surface of the moon.'

The detection of internal water from orbit means scientists can begin to test some of the findings from sample studies in a broader context, including in regions that are far from where the Apollo sites are clustered on the near side of the moon.

For many years, researchers believed that the rocks from the moon were bone-dry and any water detected in the Apollo samples had to be contamination from Earth.

Dr Kilma said: 'Now that we have detected water that is likely from the interior of the moon, we can start to compare this water with other characteristics of the lunar surface.

'This internal magmatic water also provides clues about the moon's volcanic processes and internal composition, which helps us address questions about how the moon formed and how magmatic processes changed as it cooled.'
