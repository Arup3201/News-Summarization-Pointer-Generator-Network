Football fans in Manchester may have been downcast last night, but there were a number of TV executives who would have been jumping for joy.

United and City's elimination from the Champions League means they have been exiled to the lesser-watched TV backwaters of Channel 5 and ITV4.

They, along with ESPN, have the rights to the Europa League, the competition in which the Premier League's top two teams will now be competing.

And executives at the channels will be now be looking froward to a boost in viewers of their Thursday night football coverage of Europe's second-tier competition.

Fulham's defeat in the Europa League final in 2010 was watched by 4.715million viewers on Channel 5; the ITV audience for Manchester United's Champions League final appearance this May peaked at 11million.

Not this year: Manchester City's first year in the Champions League ended at the group stages

Manchester United fans were not amused as Channel 5 posted a message on Twitter welcoming their team to the Europe League within minutes of the final whistle last night.

The Channel 5 press office tweeted: 'A warm welcome to Manchester United to the C5 team ... Â£europaleague' at 10pm as Reds fans were still coming to terms with the humiliation of being dumped out of the Champions League.

But the tweet did not go down well with United fans.

One fan wrote on Twitter: 'Are Channel 5 trying to take the p***?' while another supporter,

Darren Hoban, added : 'Sarcastic f******* t*****' and Sohail Khan wrote: 'Worst tweet ever'.

Other United fans suggested that they would not be tuning in to see the coverage.

One wrote: 'we're still not going to watch your crap channel!!' and Kris Knox added: 'as if we need another reason to avoid ch5'.

Channel 5 has enjoyed some of its biggest-ever ratings for Europa League matches, with audiences of over 2 million viewers for some games.

It will also be good news for football 
fans who don't have Sky, which has near-exclusive rights to the elite 
competition, as they will now be able to follow closely follow the two 
clubs' European fortunes.

However, the prospect is not one the players are as willing to embrace. United defender Patrice Evra said: 'It's embarrassing to be in the Europa League.'

Evra added: 'I'm not ready for it and
the way I feel now it's Champions League or nothing. It feels like a 
dream. I feel I'll wake up tomorrow and we will have qualified.

'But it's not a dream, it's the 
reality and we should have woken up earlier. We haven't been 
professional from the beginning of this competition.'

Sir Alex Ferguson's team suffered a shock 2-1 defeat in Switzerland, meaning United, last year's beaten finalists, failed to progress to the knockout stages of the competition for the first time since 2005-06 season.

And despite a convincing 2-0 win at home to Bayern Munich, City went out as they needed to better Napoli's result - but the Italians won by the same scoreline in Villarreal.

United only needed to avoid defeat but Marco Streller and Alexander Frei gave Basle a two-goal advantage before Phil Jones got one back late on.

'It's a loss because it's the best 
tournament in the world,' added Ferguson after seeing United finish 
third in what was regarded as the easiest group.

'The Europa League is a competition I've
never been in with United. It means playing on Thursday and Sunday 
right through and that has to be dealt with. That's our penalty for not 
qualifying. You have to deal with disappointment. It's been used as a 
motivation many times.'

Dejection: Both Sir Alex Ferguson and Roberto 
Mancini come to terms of being knocked out of the Champions League at 
the group stages

Manchester City boss Roberto Mancini also struggled to contain his bitter disappointment after crashing out of the Champions League.

He said: 'I think that maybe now the Europa League will feel like it's not a very important trophy, certainly not as much as the Champions League.'

Be he added: 'For City, it can be important, because we need to win trophies. If we can reach the final, then you can be sure it will mean a lot to everyone.

'We must give it our best shot, but at the moment, I am very disappointed, because I really wanted us to go through tonight.'

There was, however, some good news for Wayne Rooney - and England fans - today after he was cleared to play in England's final group game at Euro 2012.

Rooney had been facing the prospect of three games out after receiving a straight red card for kicking Miodrag Dzudovic in England's final qualifier in October.

But UEFA this morning reduced the striker's ban to two games, meaning the United forward will miss the tournament opener against France and the clash with Sweden but can return to Capello's side against Ukraine.

The 26-year-old has also agreed to do some coaching in the community, said the spokesman.Rooney's hearing for his appeal against an international ban began.
