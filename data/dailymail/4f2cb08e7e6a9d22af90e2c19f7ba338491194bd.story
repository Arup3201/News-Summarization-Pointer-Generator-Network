Benfica have opened talks with Queens Park Rangers for keeper Julio Cesar. 

The Brazilian is surplus to requirements at Loftus Road as QPR look to offload his £100,000-a-week wages.

The 34-year-old’s wages are an issue for the Portuguese champions but they are trying to negotiate a compromise deal. 

On the move: Benfica are hoping to agree a deal to take Julio Cesar to the Stadium of Light

Pedigree: Cesar played in all seven of Brazil's World Cup matches earlier this summer

Jorge Jesus' side are also looking at Manchester United’s Anders Lindegaard.

Cesar, who played in all seven of Brazil's matches at this summer's World Cup, joined Toronto in February and made seven appearances while on loan with the Canadian outfit.

Meanwhile Fulham are in talks with ex-Germany goalkeeper Timo Hildebrand.
