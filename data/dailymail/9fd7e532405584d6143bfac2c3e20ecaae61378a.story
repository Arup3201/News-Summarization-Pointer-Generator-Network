An Australian tourist’s candid snapshots of daily life in North Korea’s capital offer a unique look behind the veil of the secretive nation.

Under the watchful eye of two native guards, businessman and former aid worker Andrew Macleod visited the East Asian country in February 2013 as part of his quest to visit every nation in the world.

During his four-day excursion around snow-covered Pyongyang he photographed the city’s iconic monuments, children playing football and plenty of locals pushing, pulling and carrying loads of goods on their backs.

Andrew's visit gave him a fascinating glimpse into a city that is no longer open to tourists for the foreseeable future now that the dictatorship has closed its borders and cancelled all tours in fear of the Ebola virus outbreak in West Africa.

Even when its borders are open it can be difficult to enter the reclusive country with all tourists required to join pre-planned tours to approved sites, bypassing the poverty, starvation and notorious forced labour camps.

Andrew, 47, travelled to the capital from Beijing and his first observations were the abundance of concrete bunkers, attractive border guards and deserted roads as only a small few own cars.

Andrew Macleod said young North Koreans offered a friendly wave but older residents avoided eye contact 

He said: ‘One could feel the fear people had for their government and one was amazed at the all-pervasive control the government had over every aspect of people's lives.

‘I cannot see the break in the cycle to cause the freedom for these people. I hope they get it but I don't see the roadmap.’

His own freedom was restricted as he was not allowed to speak to Pyongyang residents on the street and most North Koreans appeared too afraid to engage with visitors.

He said: ‘I would love to have spoken to people on the streets however if I did I knew that both they and my guides would get in trouble for it.’

Young children offered a friendly wave but older North Koreans avoided eye contact and wanted nothing to do with him, possibly because they feared getting in trouble, he said.

But despite their trepidation towards Westerners, locals were friendly towards each and other and even let their children roam the empty streets unsupervised.

The first stop on his tour was the Kumsusan Palace of the Sun, a mausoleum where the bodies of Kim Il-sung and Kim Jong-il remain in state. 

Andrew Macleod encountered deserted motorways, metro stations plastered with propaganda and attractive border guards

During the trip Andrew Macleod was told how to take photos of monuments with only full-length photos allowed

The enormous white building, where loudspeakers blast out patriotic music over the open square, is a draw to loyal North Koreans hoping to pay their respects to the founding father.

But it serves as a stark reminder of the obvious discrepancy of wealth among the population.

Even so, weeping North Koreans poured into the building, many of whom were overcome with emotion at seeing the father and son lying in state.

Andrew said: ‘If you only have one source of information you believe that source of information.

‘So the emotion that you see is genuine emotion. But it's emotion based on flawed information.’

Andrew soon discovered propaganda permeated every aspect of daily life as he visited the metro network, which features murals on the walls and orchestral music blaring from the tannoy systems.

He laid a bouquet of flowers at a World War Two monument, where he paused to reflect and pointed out to one of his guides that North Korea an Australia were on the same side in the fight against the Japanese.

During his trip he was even told how to take photos of the monuments. Only full-length photos of the statues were allowed.

Andrew’s travels have taken him to some of the most difficult countries on the planet, including Iraq, Afghanistan, the former Yugoslavia and Rwanda.
