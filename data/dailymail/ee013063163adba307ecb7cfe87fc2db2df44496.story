Charles Dance is to be a father again at the age of 65, the Daily Mail can reveal.

The veteran actor is expecting a child with his fiancée Eleanor Boorman, 39.  

For painter, sculptress and former model Miss Boorman it will be a first child. However, Dance –  once labelled ‘the thinking woman’s crumpet’ – has two grown-up children from his first marriage, which ended eight years ago.

Thrilled: Charles Dance and fiancee Eleanor Boorman are expecting a child in March. It will be a first baby for Miss Boorman and a third for the veteran actor - 27 years after his last child

The baby is due in March and the couple have told close friends.

Last night, Miss Boorman confirmed the news to the Daily Mail, saying: ‘We’re expecting a baby. Fingers crossed everything will be fine. We’re both thrilled.’

A friend last night said: ‘Charles is pleased and happy at the news.’

The pair, who started dating in 2008, live together quietly in a town house in North West London. It emerged in September last year that they were engaged.

Dance won a legion of female admirers when he appeared as the suave Guy Perron in the award-winning 1984 TV series.

He married Joanna Haythorn, also a 
sculptress, in 1970 and they divorced 33 years later. Their two children
are Oliver, 36, and Rebecca, 27.

After the break-up he had a relationship with Sophia Myles, who has starred in films including Thunderbirds.

The
actress, who was in her early 20s when she started dating Dance, was 
said to be ‘utterly devastated’ when they split in 2005.

He
then had an on-off relationship with former Gucci model Shambhala 
Marthe, 36. During their relationship, French-born Miss Marthe said of 
Dance: ‘He’s great company – older men know how to woo a lady.’

Miss Boorman, whose grandfather was the wildlife artist Harry Pettit, was brought up in rural Kent.

She attended Princess Anne’s old school, Benenden, before reading anthropology, psychology and economics at Durham.

She has been commissioned to complete portraits of the Royal Family, with Prince Charles describing her work as ‘marvellous’.

Dance
spent five years in the Royal Shakespeare Company before he secured the
role in The Jewel In The Crown.

He also garnered praise for his 
portrayal of Josslyn Hay opposite Greta Scacchi in 1988’s White 
Mischief.

Since then, 
he has been a successful British export in Hollywood, appearing in big 
budget films including Alien 3 and Last Action Hero. 

In
2004, he directed Dame Judi Dench and Dame Maggie Smith in the 
acclaimed movie Ladies In Lavender, and has starred in the hugely 
popular U.S. TV series Game Of Thrones.

He moved to London following his divorce and the sale of his £2million marital home in Somerset.

The
6ft 3in star still enjoys an outdoor daily swim near his home in the 
capital. Speaking after his divorce, he said: ‘I feel 35. I probably 
behave 25. It’s certainly been a period of change for me.

‘Some
of the time I handled it well and some of the time I didn’t. It was 
difficult to get back into family life after being away.

‘But
my wife was hugely supportive of my career – was, has been and I’m sure
will continue to be so.’

Dance is not the first British star in recent 
years to be an expectant father at a more mature age.

In
2001, David Jason became a father for the first time to daughter Sophie
Mae. He was 61. Sir Paul McCartney was also 61 when Heather Mills gave 
birth to their daughter Beatrice in 2003.
