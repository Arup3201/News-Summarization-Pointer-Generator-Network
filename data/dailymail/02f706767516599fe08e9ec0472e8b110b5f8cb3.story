The drones are coming.

Armies of flying robots are set to fill our skies, doing everything from delivering medical supplies to spraying crops and inspecting high-voltage cables.

But for drones to make it to the big time, they will need to learn to get around in towns and cities - without falling on car hoods or crashing into pedestrians.

In less than a decade, as many as 32,000 commercial drones could be flying worldwide, according to aerospace consultancy Teal Group 

Today, technology has advanced to the point where hobbyists can fly the unmanned aircraft with their iPhones.

However, nobody has yet developed a successful system for the devices to sense and avoid other objects like trees, streetlights, buildings and even other drones.

'Most of these drones have very limited safety features,' says Maryanna Saenko, an analyst with science and technology consultancy Lux Research.

If one crashes, 'it's a four- or five-pound brick coming out of the sky.'

The ability to be fully autonomous will be critical before legions of drones can buzz over our neighbourhoods.

Some of the greatest dangers are close to airports, where hundreds of airline passengers could be at risk from errant drones. In December, a drone flying near Heathrow almost crashed into a passenger jet

Similar technology does exist. Commercial jets, for instance, are able to detect other planes in the sky and warn pilots of mountains in their path.

In less than a decade, as many as 32,000 commercial drones could be flying worldwide. 

However, nobody has yet developed a successful system for the devices to sense and avoid other objects like trees, streetlights, buildings and even other drones.

This means if a drone falls out of the sky, it could feel like 5lb (2.2kg) brick dropping off a tall building. 

Some of the greatest dangers are close to airports, where hundreds of airline passengers could be at risk from errant drones. 

The FAA has reports of nearly 200 cases in the past 10 months where drones got too close for comfort to manned airplanes.

Even the military, with its expert pilots, crashes drones. 

The Air Force has lost 116 unmanned aircraft in the last decade and now has a rate of about five destroyed for every 100,000 hours of flying time

The problem is how to make the detection system small, light and cheap enough to work on drones.

Recent announcements at CES in Las Vegas suggest drones will be used for everything from food delivery to firefighting.

For now, this all largely remains theoretical. Except for a few locations, U.S. airspace is closed to commercial drones with the dangers too great, according to regulators.

If safety concerns can be overcome, one of the biggest industries ripe for drone use is farming.

With the help of GPS mapping, drones can survey an entire farm, find bugs or soil that is too dry or too low in nutrients.

They could then send the exact coordinates back to a tractor that will apply pesticide, water or fertiliser only to areas in need.

There are 2,500 unmanned miniature helicopters currently used by farmers in Japan to spray pesticides in hilly areas where tractors might roll over.

Similar drones are operating in South Korean and Australia. In the U.S., the $150,000 (£99,000) helicopters are being considered for the steep slopes of California vineyards.

Meanwhile Amazon says its drone delivery service could someday get packages to customers in 30 minutes or less.

Through its Prime Air service, Amazon aims to have drones flying 50 mph (80 kph) and capable of carrying up to 5lb (2.25kg).

'They will become as normal as seeing delivery trucks driving down the street,' says Paul Misner, Amazon's global vice president of public policy.

German delivery company Deutsche Post DHL is already testing a drone, but only to a remote tourist island in the North Sea and just for urgent deliveries of medicine.

While companies wait, more and more hobbyists are putting drones in the skies. Many can be operated with an iPhone or Android smartphone, and some cost just $300 (£200).

Some of the greatest danger of these small drones is close to airports, where hundreds of airline passengers could be at risk from errant drones.

Concerns over the lack of intelligence of these drones is attempted to be addressed by researchers worldwide.

Military drone-maker Aurora Flight Sciences, of Manassas, Virginia, for instance, is trying to tackle the challenge using echolocation.

This sends out sound waves and detects the echo reflected by obstacles. It's similar to sonar on a submarine or the way bats fly around in the dark.

Other companies are using optical sensors to search for obstacles. But those systems have challenges, including not working well in darkness or fog.

The first uses are likely to be in remote, sparsely populated areas. Some of the proposed commercial applications for drones include:

Tackling dangerous jobs 

Drones could be search places that aren't safe for humans, such as looking for survivors in collapsed buildings after an earthquake or inspecting nuclear power plants following a meltdown.

They could also help firefighters battling forest blazes by watching where flames are appearing without risking lives. Helicopters often can't be used because their powerful rotors threaten to spread the fire.

Scientists are also hoping drones will help conduct research inside volcanic ash clouds, hurricanes, tornadoes or other spots that are not safe for humans.

Surveying large industry 

According to industry experts, drones could be used to inspect miles of remote power lines quickly and at less cost.

They may also have applications in surveying farmers' land, finding bugs or soil that is too dry or lacking nutrients, and then sending the exact GPS coordinates back to a tractor which will apply pesticide, water or fertiliser only to areas in need.

Offering better vantage points 

Drones could create that perfect shot for film directors.They may also allow media to find new ways to cover news and sports. 

Drones provided aerial television coverage of snowboard and ski jump competitions at the Sochi 2014 Winter Olympics.

Other uses include photographing weddings, mapping coastal erosion and showing off homes and the surrounding neighborhoods for real estate agents looking to set their listings apart.

Solving unique challenges 

In the future, drones could help protect endangered animals by sending real-time video and thermal images of animals and poachers to wildlife rangers.

They may also temporarily expanding cell phone reception at special events like the Super Bowl.

Delivering packages might be years away but DHL is currently testing limited, urgent deliveries of medicine on a remote island in the North Sea.

In the United States, much of the work is being done at six government-approved drone test sites, all of which are connected with universities.

They are among the few spots in the country where unmanned aircraft can be legally flown to test what works and what doesn't.

'This is a large sandbox right now,' says Ahmed Mahdy, a mechanical engineering professor at Texas A&M University's Corpus Christi campus, one of the test site operators.

The FAA estimates that 7,500 drones – a third of all drones worldwide - will be flying in the U.S. within five years. The industry puts the number in the hundreds of thousands.

Compare that to the four largest U.S. airlines, with their combined fleet of 4,728 planes.

One of the most promising areas of application for drones is in farming. There are 2,500 unmanned miniature helicopters currently used by farmers in Japan to spray pesticides in hilly areas where tractors might roll over

'The FAA is just scared to death,' says David Bridges, a mechanical engineering professor testing drones at Texas A&M University in Corpus Christi. 'U.S. airspace is one of the safest in the world. It's their job to keep it that way.'

FAA Administrator Michael Huerta says drone technology is promising but needs to be phased in responsibly.

The Federal Aviation Administration plans to release guidelines soon about who can fly drones weighing less than 55lbs (25kg) and under what conditions.

They might include the extremely stringent - and costly - requirement that operators have a pilot's license.

That means some of the most ambitious drone ideas, like Amazon's package-delivery system, may have to wait.
