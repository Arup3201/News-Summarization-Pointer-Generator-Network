The mother of a deputy head girl who went missing for three days said she never wanted to let her daughter go once they were reunited.

Ella Hysom, 15, who disappeared during treatment for depression, was brought back safe and well to her family after a member of the public recognised her from an appeal in the Daily Mail.

Yesterday her mother Alison, 43, said the family was beginning the long journey of convincing Ella she is beautiful.

Mrs Hysom said: ‘I have gone from being really, really worried to being delighted and relieved that she was found, and found safe.

‘When we saw her I wanted to hold her, hug her and never let her go. I have been through every emotion in the last 24 hours. I still cannot sleep, I still cannot register that we have got her back safely.’

Mrs Hysom, who runs a training company, said she now wants her ‘beautiful’ and ‘intelligent’ daughter to realise her potential.

‘What is important to understand is that she does have a mental illness and she is very depressed and she still needs to receive treatment for that to get better,’ she said.

‘The thing with depression is that it is not an illness that heals in the same way that a wound does. We have got a long way to go to ensure Ella is mentally fit and healthy.

‘We are going to spend a lot of  time with her and the next step is to focus on her treatment so she can have a positive future as every 15-year-old deserves.’

Ella was deputy head girl at her school in Colchester, Essex, and a keen rower.

‘Before she became ill she was incredibly driven, she has a phenomenal amount of potential,’ Mrs Hysom said. ‘She was predicted As for her GCSEs and had won all these cups for rowing.

‘She has so much potential and we now need to help her to see that, but it will take a while I think.

‘As part of her depressive illness  she had very low self-esteem, so whilst we on the outside can see she is stunningly beautiful, 5ft 10in, slim  and gorgeous, she is not able to see that herself.’

Ella went missing around 1pm on Monday close to a residential clinic in Ilford, East London, where she had been treated for six weeks. She had written a number of emotional messages on Twitter and Facebook that suggested she had split from a boyfriend who had found a new love.

‘The higher I get, the lower I sink. I can’t drown my demons, they know how to swim,’ she wrote. ‘I long for that feeling to not feel at all.’

Hours before she vanished she wrote online: ‘I just want to die and hopefully that will happen so I don’t have to wake up tomorrow morning.’ Ella was found at lunchtime on Thursday when a shopper, who had seen her face on the front page of the Daily Mail recognised her as she walked around Ilford town centre.

Her mother and father Tim, 43, found out their daughter was safe and well in a phone call from police.

Mrs Hysom said: ‘We received a phone from our family liaison officer and I had to ask her to say it three times before it sank in because it was really, really emotional. I don’t know, it took a while to register.’

Ella was reunited with her parents at a police station in east London.

Relieved: Mrs Hysom, pictured with her husband Ian, says she cannot sleep and still cannot register properly that they have got her back

‘It was emotional,’ said Mrs Hysom. ‘Until then I had been holding it together and been focused on finding her. But then we had her, we could see her and touch her. All of our emotions came out. I’ve cried a lot.

‘I told her, “I am so glad that we found you and that you are safe”. I was so pleased to see her I just kept telling her that.

‘We just wanted to spend time with her, be with her, and make sure she felt secure and safe by the time the evening came. We were able to say good night to her and hold her.’

Ella has now returned to the clinic where she was receiving treatment and was yesterday spending time with her parents, 11-year-old sister and nine-year-old brother.

During her three days away, Ella, who only had a small amount of money with her, had managed to find somewhere to sleep and enough food to survive.

Mrs Hysom said she thought she may never see her daughter again, adding: ‘I’ve been sick with worry, I haven’t been able to sleep or eat. I have been living on coffee and the odd bit of chocolate since Monday.

‘It is the most distressing experience I have ever been through … I tried to stay hopeful the whole time and not think about all the worst possibilities. They were always in the back of my mind, but I wanted to keep my energy focused on finding her.’
