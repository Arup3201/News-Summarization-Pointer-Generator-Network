Charged: Michael Jason Fields, 32 (pictured) has been accused of bludgeoning his 32-year-old girlfriend, Christina Mahzamani, to death with a cinder block

A 32-year-old man has been accused of bludgeoning his girlfriend to death with a cinder block in his Florida backyard and trying to conceal the murder.

Michael Jason Fields has been charged with killing mother-of-three Christina Mahzamani on Sunday night at a home on St Cloud Oaks Drive in Valrico where he rents a room.

He was arrested on Tuesday afternoon, just hours after calling police to say he'd found the single mom's body outside his house.

According to the Hillsborough County Sheriff's Office, Fields beat Mahzamani to death before dumping her car half a mile away from his house and dragging her lifeless body to the front pavement in a bid to cover-up her death.

For Mahzaman's devastated children, the horror began on Sunday when their mom left their Brandon home about 9pm to pick up eye drops and didn't return.

According to the police statement, the children - aged 13, nine and seven - called their father, who was interstate, to say they were home alone.

The father called Vali Mahzamani, understood to be a relative of the victim, who took the children to his house.

When Mahzamani hadn't returned home by 8.45pm on Monday, Vali Mahzamani filed a missing person's report.

Earlier that day, Mahzamani's 2013 Buick Enclave was found abandoned and blocking a driveway on Briar Meadows Drive in Valrico, with her car keys and other personal items inside.

Fearing the worst, Mahzamani's family and friends set up a Facebook page - Find Christina Mahzamani - in a desperate bid to find the 32-year-old.

Police had no luck in their search - until 2.20pm Tuesday when Fields called 911 to say he'd found a deceased woman outside his residence.

Heartbreaking: Mahzamani was a single mom who friends say doted on her three young children (pictured). They were the last to see her on Sunday night

When detectives interviewed Fields at the crime scene, he said Mahzamani visited him at his home about 11pm Sunday and drove away in her vehicle a short time later. He said he didn't hear from her again.

However crime scene investigators didn't believe him, claiming they'd discovered blood at the scene, 
footprints near that blood matching Fields' shoes, a blood-covered cinder block and a pair of pajamas
 in Fields' bedroom with blood on it.

They also claimed to have found drag marks on the grass and leaves leading from the backyard towards the middle of two houses.

Police arrested Fields, a handyman and personal trainer, and charged him with second-degree murder with a weapon. However they say the motive for the alleged murder is not clear.

News of Mahzamani's horrific death has devastated her family and friends, who described the young mom as 'a hard worker' and 'thoughtful friend'.

The victim's sister refused to identify herself, but told WTSP Mahzamani was a devoted and loving mother. Her father-in-law also said she was a good mother.

Mahzamani's friend, Holly Walton, told Tampa Bay Times the young woman was working hard to improve her life.

Walton said that as Mahzamani's marriage dissolved, the stay-at-home mom poured her energy into eating better and losing weight and was planning to undertake classes for the General Educational Development test. 

Desperate search: Friends and family set up a 'Find Christina Mahzamani' page on Facebook when she didn't return home to her children on Sunday night and was still missing the next day

Mahzamani
 had her first child as a teenager.

'Being
 that she was that young of a mother, she took on that role and didn't 
do the things that others did in their late teens or early 20s,' Walton 
said.

'Now that she had the time and ability, she was focused on doing 
some good things for herself and her family.'

Mahzamani was actively involved in mother's group, Brandon Active Moms Group, attended activities at Bell Shoals Baptist Church, enjoyed biking and walking, and donated generously to an annual toy drive.

'We're all devastated,' Walton said. 'We feel for the whole family. We'll all miss her.'
