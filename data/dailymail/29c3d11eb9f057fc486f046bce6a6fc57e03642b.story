Around 1.5million Mastercard and Visa accounts have been hacked in a major credit card heist.

The data leak was revealed on 
Friday, when both companies confirmed that a major theft of U.S. consumers' credit 
card data was being investigated.

It was first thought that as many as 10million customers' information had been stolen.

Investigation: Mastercard and Visa are said to have notified all of their customers of the security breach

The companies, which are the two largest 
global credit card processors, said the issue stemmed from a third-party
 vendor, Global Payments, and not their own internal systems.

'Less than 1,500,000 card numbers may have been exported,' by hackers who had access to the firm's payment processing system, Global Payments said in a statement. 

'Cardholder names, addresses and social security numbers were not obtained by the criminals.'

However, even without this 
information, the company admitted that the data taken from each account 
would be enough to make fraudulent transactions.

It also said hacker access was limited to North America.

Following the news, trading in the company's shares was halted after they dropping more than 9.1 per cent.

Global Payments said it had 'identified and self-reported unauthorized access into a portion of its processing system' and had determined in early March that the intruders might have gained access to credit-card data.

Customers have been urged to check 
their accounts online or contact their financial institution regarding 
any concerns they have.

Litan, right, security analyst at Gartner Research, said there are signs the data is already being used by thieves 

Mastercard said in a statement: 
'MasterCard is concerned whenever there is any possibility that 
cardholders could be inconvenienced and we continue to both monitor this
 event and take steps to safeguard account information.'

Visa also released a statement saying their customers were victims of data theft, but said its own systems were not hacked.

The company has provided the issuing 
banks with the affected account numbers and assured customers they would
 not be responsible for fraudulent purchases.

The companies' statements came after the blog Krebs on Security reported that MasterCard and Visa have been alerting banks across the U.S. about a 'massive' breach that may affect more than ten million cardholders.

Brian Krebs told Technology Live: 'Law enforcement asked everyone to keep 
it quiet so as not to disturb investigations.'

Theft: MasterCard confirmed they are currently investigating a potential account data compromise event of a U.S.-based entity

The breach likely occurred at a central 
aggregation point where card information is calculated, said Avivah 
Litan, security analyst at Gartner Research.

She believes the data is already being used on the street by identity thieves.

She wrote on her blog: 'I’ve spoken with folks in the card business who are seeing signs of this breach mushroom. Looks like the hackers have started using the stolen card data more recently.

'From what I hear, the breach involves a taxi and parking garage company in the New York City area, so if you’ve paid a NYC cab in the last few months with your credit or debit card — be sure to check your card statements for possible fraud.'

She also said that unverified reports point to a 'Central American gang that broke into the company's system by answering the application's knowledge-based authentication questions correctly.

'Looks like the hackers took over an administrative account that was not protected sufficiently.'
