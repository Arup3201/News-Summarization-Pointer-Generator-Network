Her former lover is steeling himself for battle as the Italian election race heats up, but Silvio Berlusconi's ex-girlfriend Nicole Minetti is enjoying a far more relaxed start to the new year.

The bikini-clad politician, 26, was spotted soaking up the sunshine and splashing in the waves on holiday in Miami, Florida.

Back in Italy, 76-year-old billionaire Berlusconi is preparing to seek election as the country's prime minister for a fourth time.

Miss Minetti has declared her opinion that Berlusconi's new fiance, 27-year-old television presenter Francesca Pascale, would make an 'excellent' first lady, as the countdown to next month's election begins.

The 26-year-old, whose mother is English, was thrust into the limelight by her association with Italy's former leader.

After being appointed as a councillor for Berlusconi's People of Freedom Party in Lombardy despite having no apparent political experience, Miss Minetti was caught up in Italy's notorious 'Bunga Bunga' scandal when she was accused of supplying escorts for the former leader's lavish parties.

She was also embroiled in the 'Caso Ruby' scandal when it was discovered she owned four flats which were occupied by show girls.

The qualified dental hygienist, who has re-launched her career as a fashion model, is also being investigated over allegations she improperly requested state reimbursements for €27,000 (£22,000) in spa treatments, hotels and dinners.

The upcoming election in Italy was triggered when Mario Monti stepped down after his budget was approved in December.

Berlusconi's People of Freedom Party 
had withdrawn its support for Mr Monti, who had taken over as head of a 
technical government in November 2011.

Mr Monti, 69, has now abandoned his 
mediator role to enter politics in his own right and lead a centrist 
alliance to fight the election due to be held at the end of February.

The respected economist is now in a 
three-way race with the Democratic Party on the left and his former 
allies in Berlusconi's People of Freedom Party on the right.

Berlusconi has harshly criticised his decision to enter the race, and insisted Mr Monti lacks credibility.

His rival retaliated by saying 
Berlusconi's view represented the 'judgement of a person who has 
demonstrated a certain volatility in judgement'.
