Tracy Taylor says she is shocked that the motorist who knocked her off her bike during a Christmas Eve hit-and-run has got away 'scot-free'

A hit-and-run motorist who caused a cyclist shocking injuries after  leaving her for dead in a muddy ditch will not face any criminal charges, it emerged today.

Mother-of-one Tracy Taylor was flung head-first off the road after a car ploughed into her bike while she was out cycling on Christmas Eve.

The 36-year-old, from Leek, Staffordshire, had stopped to take a photograph of the scenery when she was thrown nearly two metres in the air by a vehicle travelling in the opposite direction.

The fitness instructor then slid through the mud, knocking herself unconscious. She also suffered a broken collar bone as well as cuts and bruises to her face.

But the driver drove away from the scene, leaving Ms Taylor for dead by the roadside in the Meerbrook area of the Staffordshire Moorlands.

Staffordshire Police launched an investigation and Ms Taylor released pictures of her injuries, prompting the driver to hand himself into police. 

But the force said today that they will not prosecute the 18-year-old driver due to a lack of evidence.

Ms Taylor, who is recovering after undergoing an operation to insert metal pins into her shoulder, said she was shocked that the driver had got away 'scot-free'.

She said: 'The guy handed himself in to police a week after I released the pictures but he's essentially got off scot-free. I just feel back to square one now, I'm really disappointed by the decision.'

The  collision was also witnessed by Ms Taylor's friend Helen Birch-Machin, who was cycling with her at the time. 

The 48-year-old called an ambulance and Ms Taylor was rushed to Macclesfield Hospital where she needed nine stitches to her wounds. She is still unable to work. 

Ms Taylor added: 'I just feel useless. I haven't been able to work. I'm usually so fit and active and I haven't been able to run or cycle since.

The fitness instructor  landed on her face and was left with cuts and bruises (pictured) after the car, which was travelling in the opposite direction, ploughed into her while she was out cycling in Staffordshire 

'The police just told me there was lack of evidence and it's really difficult to prove dangerous driving.

'But just because its difficult I don't think it means they shouldn't try. They have a witness already and you can see what he did to me in the pictures. It was hard to take as the police had been really good to me.'

Ms Taylor said the case had been passed over to traffic officers, meaning the driver could still be charged with a lesser offence.

But she added: 'Its just a waiting game now for me to see whether I will ever be able to return to work. But mentally it has been very difficult for me too. 

Ms Taylor had been out with he friend Helen Birch-Machin when the pair stopped to take photographs of the scenery

'I cannot remember Christmas or my 37th birthday, which was the following week. I have been left physically scarred for life but the mental scars are much worse.

'In the meantime, it appears the person responsible for leaving me in this state has got away with it.'  

Speaking at the time, Ms Taylor said she felt lucky to be alive.

'The car was approaching very fast and the next thing I knew I'd been knocked unconscious and was lying in the road,' she said.  

The keen cyclist also suffered cuts and bruises to her legs (left and right) but was discharged from hospital in time for Christmas with her son 

She was treated at Macclesfield hospital where she had to have nine stitches for her injuries 

'My face was covered in mud and cuts, and my helmet was completely smashed to pieces.

'I kept coming in and out of consciousness and Helen called my dad because he was closer than any ambulance.  

'I can't believe the driver left the scene - it was cowardly. My bike helmet saved my life. If it wasn't for my helmet I would be in a mortuary.' 

A police spokesman said: 'There was insufficient evidence to charge the driver. The cyclist has been updated on our decision.'
