The doyen of TV cricket commentators is in a stable condition recovering after the crash

Cricket commentator and former Australian test captain Richie Benaud has been taken to hospital after crashing his car into a wall. 

The doyen of TV cricket commentators is in a stable condition and said to be recovering after the crash. 

According to Nine Network, 83-year-old Benaud was driving home after playing golf near his home in Sydney's south-eastern beach suburbs on Wednesday when his vintage 1963 Sunbeam Alpine hit a small brick wall.

Benaud sustained chest and shoulder injuries and was expected to remain in hospital for a few days.

'Police attended and there were no charges,' said Nine Network. 

'Despite being in some discomfort, the former Australian cricket captain and legendary all-rounder remains in fine spirits and good humor.' 

In a statement, Benaud said: 'No one else was injured, and I was more worried about the car than myself.'

Daphne Benaud said her husband was 'looking unbelievably well.'

Benaud, who became Australia captain in 1958, masterminded two Ashes series triumphs against England and never lost a Test series.

In 1963 he became the first cricketer from his country to score 2,000 Test runs and take 200 wickets.

He easily transitioned into the role of TV commentator after the 
formation of World Series Cricket and has been a mainstay of Nine 
Network's cricket coverage ever since.

Benaud
had been scheduled to join the commentary panel during the Ashes series
between Australia against England starting next month in Brisbane.

The following year, he retired to take 
up a career in journalism, where his authoritative, chatty style and 
enthusiasm for the game made him popular in the UK, where he worked for 
the BBC and Channel Four, and Australia with Channel Nine.
