Brendan Rodgers hailed Raheem Sterling as a quick learner as the England winger showed he had reaped the benefits of shooting practice.

The England winger showed great composure to score the only goal of the game at Turf Moor, rounding Burnley keeper Tom Heaton before sliding his effort into an empty net.

In a similar situation at Old Trafford two weeks ago, Sterling missed a number of chances but, since then, the 20-year-old has scored three times in three appearances and Liverpool’s manager explained he has been doing intense training at Melwood.

Rodgers said: 'It showed what a great learner he is. He is in a position now, he will receive a lot of opportunities in that kind of situation because of his pace. His pace will take him away from anyone and since that game he has gone away with the coaches and worked on that type of finish, both left side and right side.

‘He showed great composure and a great ability to learn, to beat the keeper and finished it really well. His development and ability to want to be better has got us the three points.’

Burnley were much the better side in the first half but when asked if Liverpool were fortunate, Rodgers said: ‘Not at all. I thought that in terms of our character and resilience in the game we showed outstanding qualities when needed. There weren’t many chances but the one clear one that came to us, we put it away. We deserved three points for the character we showed.’

Burnley boss Sean Dyche argued: 'We had our pocket pinched today with how they got away with a win.

Brendan Rodgers was pleased to see Liverpool win away at Burnley 

'I don’t remember Tom Heaton making too many saves and I remember our back four being on the front foot. They have a group of very talented players. You look at the group, the signings they have made, you know it is a challenge.'

Meanwhile, Simon Mignolet will return to Liverpool’s goal on Monday night after Brad Jones was injured during the game. Reserve keeper Danny Ward will be Mignolet’s deputy.

Brad Jones - 5.5

Replaced after a quarter-of-an-hour by Simon Mignolet. Little to do before picking up his injury, although he did stand helpless as a Danny Ings strike hit the post from distance.

Kolo Toure - 5.5

Substituted after 45 minutes. Struggled with the movement of Ings and Ashley Barnes.

Martin Skrtel - 6

Liverpool’s most confident and dominant defender. Had to organise well with Mignolet so nervy behind him.

Mamadou Sakho - 6

Powerful in the air but awkward in possession. Defended well, though, and that’s his job.

Jordan Henderson - 6

Typically industrious but he is not a wing-back. Looks like a square peg in a round hole at the moment.

Lucas Leiva - 6.5

Sluggish early on but grew in authority as the game went on. A useful foil for Steven Gerrard in the middle.

Steven Gerrard - 6.5

One super ball to release Adam Lallana in the first-half but found it difficult against an effervescent Burnley midfield.

Adam Lallana - 6

Should have done better when through on goal in the first-half and struggling to recapture the brilliance of his performances for Southampton from last season.

Lazar Markovic - 5.5

A few flashes but he needs to start doing more to justify the fee that brought him from Portugal to Merseyside.

Philippe Coutinho - 7.5

Magnificent piece of skill to set up Sterling goal. Drifts in and out of games but capable of decisive moments.

Raheem Sterling - 7.5

Tireless up front and produced a calm finish when Liverpool needed it. Still can’t help but feel his talents are wasted as a lone frontman. Still, needs must.

Simon Mignolet (for Jones, 16) - 4.5

Skewed clearances, one hit against Burnley forward Ings, and a lot of flapping from set-pieces. Rodgers simply must buy a goalkeeper in January.

Emre Can (for Kolo Toure, 45) - 6

Liverpool improved after Emre Can arrived in the second half. Good shift at centre half and used the ball well.

Rickie Lambert (for Coutinho, 73) - 6

Goal ruled out for offside.
