Forget being a supermodel as a career choice - young Chinese women are now dreaming that when they grow up they will get the chance to be an e-sport hostess.

A recent report on 163.com, one of China's most-read websites, suggested that such hostesses, who are hired by gaming platforms to commentate on online video games and host live events in scanty clothing, are among the best-paid people in the country.

Han Yiying, China’s top-paid e-sport hostess, was paid around ¥17 million (£1.8 million) to join a gaming company at the end of 2014.

According to Xiao Xue, the income for hostesses vary considerably

Part of her job is to interact with live gamers over the Internet

Han's income almost caught up with Liu Xiang, a hugely popular Olympic gold medalist from China. 

Wages for e-sport hostesses increased more than 10 times in 2014 alone, according to the report.

E-sport, short for Electronic Sports, is the name for organised multi-player video game competitions in which mostly male players pay to take part.

Video game competitions associated with electronic sports involve real-time strategy, fighting and first-person shooter contests.

Originally from Sichuan, Han is also a professional online gamer and has participated in international competitions such as World Cyber Games

Many Chinese men take part in the events for a chance to ogle and communicate with beautiful women

There are cash prizes to competitors, but the real attraction for many Chinese men taking part in the events is the opportunity to ogle and communicate with beautiful women like Han Yiying, who is dubbed ‘Queen of e-sport’.

Ms Han’s daily job includes dressing in a sexy outfit and chatting to the male competitors in the contests either through the internet or in person when there are live events.

Han is also a professional gamer who has participated in a variety of international gaming competitions, including World Cyber Games.

Han is one of a growing number of professional and highly paid e-sport hostesses, with at least 20 reported to be earning similar money.

However, most of the hostesses are still on salaries considerably lower.

163.com reported that some of the new hostesses could only afford to eat one cup noodle per day, but they entered the industry out of passion.

Beginners such as Xiaoxue are lowly paid and can only afford eating instant noodles
