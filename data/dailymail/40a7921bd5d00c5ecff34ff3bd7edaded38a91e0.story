Briefly we had the whiff of a comeback.

As the rain fell in Derby, Steve McClaren’s progressive Championship side, two down and seemingly finished, had just pulled a goal back on Chelsea seemingly out of nowhere. As is always the case in such situations, momentum had switched at a stroke.

Derby found energy, Chelsea only uncertainty.

And then, a long ball forwards from the Chelsea half prompted a race between a fresh visiting substitute with a point to prove and a 29-year-old Derby defender who had spent much of the previous 80 minutes locked in sapping combat with Didier Drogba.

Ratings by Ian Ladyman at the iPro Stadium

There was perhaps only like to be one winner and as Loic Remy and Jake Buxton hustled for the ball, arms inevitably became entwined and both tumbled to the floor.

The inevitable question was: Who grabbed who first?

Replays showed that Remy may have been guilty while another argument suggested Buxton had been the initial offender, placing his arm across his opponent.

Whatever the case, Buxton was adjudged guilty by a linesman and walked the long walk. Moments later Chelsea – a man to the good and back in control of their own nerves – scored a decisive third goal and a place in the last four of one of Jose Mourinho’s favourite competitions was theirs.

Certainly it was controversial and it may have robbed us of some late intrigue.

The lesson here for defenders, though, is that in these situations, they always have the most to lose. Better perhaps to avoid the flailing arms, the tangling limbs, and put your faith in your own turn of foot. Failing that, perhaps, just close your eyes and hope the centre forward misses.

Here, it was an unfortunate end to what had been a gripping game.

Chelsea had started slowly but had, for the middle hour, been imperious.

The manner in which they have responded to their recent Barclays Premier League defeat at Newcastle has been impressive and only a brave man would put money on Stoke as Chelsea head west along the A50 from here to begin their Christmas and New Year’s programme next Monday night.

Derby, though, are a capable team. They looked sporadically dangerous with the ball and deserved to be in the contest until the death. Ultimately, perhaps, Chelsea’s greater quality in the final third made a greater difference than the late linesman’s flag.

Initially, Derby were impressive, quick, sharp and mobile. By some distance, their best player was the young Englishman Will Hughes.

Impossible to miss given his peroxide blond hair, Hughes is easy on the eye as a footballer, possessing a neat touch and a decent first yard of acceleration. Here, he troubled Chelsea for a while but was too often let down by team-mates not on the same wavelength.

At times, Hughes wanted it short and it went long. On other occasions, the pass in to his feet was a fraction off. These things can make a difference.

And so it was that Chelsea reached the midway point of the first half having conceded ground and possession but no real chances. They then sprang forward to score with their first real attack of note and sadly the goal had its root in a dreadful mistake.

Captain Richard Keogh played an unfortunate part in the build up to the Bobby Zamora goal that sunk Derby in last season’s play-off final and he erred again here, conceding the ball unnecessarily to Cesc Fabregas on the corner of his own penalty area.

There was still much to do for Chelsea but good teams don’t need asking twice and when Fabregas fed the ball inside to Eden Hazard the Belgian twisted to his right to create a better angle and shot low past Lee Grant in the Derby goal.

It was a real blow for Derby simply because Chelsea hadn’t looked like creating much until that point. For the next ten minutes, however, Mourinho’s team suddenly looked capable of closing out the game quickly.

Another chance arrived for Hazard – the shot was dragged across goal – before left-back Felipe Luis hammered a drive straight at Grant. Derby reached the interval without further setback, though, while Chelsea lost defender Kurt Zouma to a head injury suffered while defending a corner.

Whether that shook Mourinho’s players we don’t know but Hughes spurned the opportunity to punish a slow start by the visitors to the second half when he drove a low shot at Petr Cech following good work from Johnny Russell down the right.

Hughes perhaps should have scored and he rued his error shortly when Chelsea’s Luis curled a free-kick past Grant from 25 yards to extend the lead with half an hour still to play.

In truth a Derby comeback didn’t look likely. Their race looked run.

But Craig Bryson swept in a super goal from 18 yards after Russell set him up with twenty minutes left and the tide threatened to turn their way.

Soon after came the talking point, however. When Andre Schurrle swept in a rebound after Remy’s low shot was parried, Derby supporters were still grumbling.
