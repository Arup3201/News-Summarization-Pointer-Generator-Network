Prince Harry became embroiled in a real-life crime drama when he came to the rescue of one of his best friends after he was mugged on a London street.

According to police records, the Prince was on the phone to Thomas van Straubenzee at the exact moment a robber took his friend’s BlackBerry mobile.

Harry heard the scuffle taking place and immediately drove to the scene with his protection officer. Fearing 28-year-old Mr van Straubenzee had been hurt, the Prince circled the streets of Battersea, South-West London, looking for him.

When he could not find his friend, he  drove to the nearest police station where he found Mr van Straubenzee reporting the crime. Because he had overheard the mugging taking place, Prince Harry was required to give a police statement, which is now part of an ongoing investigation.

Last night, Wandsworth police told The Mail on Sunday that they had arrested a man in connection with the robbery and recovered the stolen mobile phone. The man was released on bail.

It is believed to be the first time a senior Royal has walked into a police station to report a crime.

A police source said: ‘Prince Harry came into the station to give a statement. It was a separate statement from the one given by his friend who was mugged.’

A police spokesman said: ‘Police are 
investigating an allegation of personal robbery which occurred at 
approximately 8.30pm on Wednesday, November 30, in Albert Bridge Road, 
SW11.

‘A mobile phone was 
taken during the robbery. This allegation was taken seriously,  as are 
all allegations of robbery. A man was arrested on Thursday, December 1 
on  suspicion of robbery and bailed to return in January pending further
inquiries. Police from Wandsworth are investigating.’

An
aide told The Mail on Sunday how Harry, who is believed to have been at
Clarence House, his London residence, leapt into action after their 
conversation came to an abrupt end. ‘Prince Harry was aware of what had 
happened to his friend and drove to the area immediately to try to find 
him,’ the aide said.

‘He 
circled the streets for a while in his car before following intuition 
and finding his friend at a local police station in Battersea Bridge 
Road. The Prince wanted to be there to offer some comfort and friendly 
support.

‘Prince Harry 
made his way to the station and by the time he arrived the police had 
already enacted a number of operational procedures, which involved very 
swift action and the kind of scenes you see on The Bill. Both the Prince
and his friend were very grateful to the police for how they handled 
it.’

The 27-year-old 
Prince, who has recently returned to the UK from America where he has 
been completing the final stages of his Apache helicopter training 
course, took Mr van Straubenzee home, then returned to Clarence House 
with his protection officer.

The
Prince and Mr van Straubenzee are childhood friends and attended 
Ludgrove school in Berkshire and Eton together. Mr van Straubenzee is 
also a close friend of Prince William and was one of his ushers at his 
wedding.

Nicknamed ‘Van’ 
by his friends, the 28-year-old accompanied Prince William on his first 
official tour  to New Zealand in 2005 and is a  regular guest at William
and Kate’s Anglesey home.

Both
Princes are also close to Tom’s parents, Alex and Claire van 
Straubenzee, who live at their family’s estate in Grantham, 
Lincolnshire, and are patrons of a memorial fund dedicated to Tom’s 
brother Henry, who was killed in a car crash in 2002.

The fund raises money to help schoolchildren in Uganda. The Dutch-descended Van Straubenzees have a long history with the Royal Family and have served the British Crown for at least 150 years.

Alex van Straubenzee is a former officer in the Royal Green Jackets, a regiment since merged into  The Rifles.

William and Harry socialise frequently with Tom and his younger brother Charlie. Just weeks ago, Prince Harry attended a party for the Van Straubenzee memorial fund, and the friends regularly shoot together.

Clarence House last night confirmed the mugging but said they could not comment on whether Prince Harry was speaking to Mr van Straubenzee at the time he was mugged because the police investigation is ongoing.

A spokesman for Prince Harry said: ‘Prince Harry joined a friend  at a police station in South London after his friend had reported a  robbery. By the time Prince Harry arrived to be with his friend, the police investigation into the incident had already begun.

‘The investigation is ongoing, so we cannot comment further.’

Wealthy Battersea has become a crime hotspot for muggings, murders  and drug-dealing.Rich residents have become targets of robberies, often committed by street gangs in the area – a stone’s throw across the Thames from exclusive Chelsea.

Last month Richard Ward, 37, died from massive head injuries after being set upon in an unprovoked gang attack.

In February, Niall Hall, a former aide  to the Queen Mother, was carjacked and kidnapped by a gang who stripped him naked and ran knives along his body.

Mr Hall, 49, was forced to reveal his bank card PIN numbers, and his valuable watch and cash were stolen.

He had to be treated for bleeding in the brain. Four men recently went on trial in connection with the attack. A fifth man has pleaded guilty.

In the same month, firefighter’s wife Anna Smith, 33, suffered a severe beating from thugs in the area after she fought to save a female neighbour from being mugged.

One of the most horrific crimes in Battersea was the murder in 2002 of local estate agent Tim Robinson.

Dwaine Williams was jailed for life after stabbing Mr Robinson, 25, in front of his girlfriend to get his £20,000 Audi Quattro.

In 2007, drug addict Elmi Said Elmi was jailed for three-and-a-half years for setting his Staffordshire bull terrier on people to steal their mobiles and cash.
