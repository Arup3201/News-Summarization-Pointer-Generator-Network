A woman desperate to have a baby is appealing for donations from strangers so she can afford IVF treatment after being refused by the NHS.

Eva McConville, 28, from Liverpool, is using crowdfunding website gofundme.com in order to raise £6,000 so she can have a child with her fiancé, Matty.

The couple have been turned down for fertility treatment on the NHS because Matty already has a child from a previous relationship.

Last resort: Eva has set up a crowdfunding page to raise money so she can have IVF after being refused assistance on the NHS 

Eva told the Sun On Sunday that the fundraising appeal - set up by her mother, Patricia, is their last resort.

Eva said: 'I hate having to ask for money but it's our only chance. I'm willing to do anything to get our baby.

'Not having as baby absolutely kills us.'

The couple have so far received £1,455 after Patricia, 55, set up the appeal for her daughter last June. 

Patricia said: 'To see Eva destroyed by this was awful. If I had the money they'd have it in a second. But this was something I could do.'

On the crowdfunding page, Patricia reveals how Eva and Matty had been unsuccessfully trying for a baby for four years after being together since 2001.

Matty, 33, discovered a lump on one of his testicles and, concerned that this was the reason they were failing to conceive, he went to his doctor to be examined.

The couple were horrified to discover that it was in fact lymphoma.

Matty had his testicle removed and underwent chemotherapy and radiotherapy from 2011 onwards.

He was told before his treatment commenced that there was still hope he and Eva could have a child in the future if he deposited his sperm in a sperm bank.

Patricia said: 'Throughout the period of Matty’s treatment, I believe what got them through was the hope that they would fulfil their dream of having a child.'

However, the couple received a letter from The Hewitt Fertility Centre, part of Liverpool Women's NHS Foundation Trust, saying they would not be able to have IVF.

Eva said: 'Because  Matty has had cancer, IVF is our only hope. But the NHS won't pay because he has a child from a past relationship.'

Patricia said she's devastated her daughter may never be a mother.

She writes on their gofundme page: 'What about Eva's right to be a mother or for them to raise their own child and be a family?'

Builder Matty has recovered from cancer thanks to his treatment and Patricia said while they are all grateful for this, the couple face an unhappy future if they cannot have a baby. 

So far, Eva is £1,455 towards her £6,000 target after her mother set up the page on her behalf

Patricia, a social worker, said it has taken a huge toll on her daughter's well-being.

She said: 'I could go on and on about my research into the psychological issues and effects related to infertility but I wish to focus on what my family and I have observed first-hand with Eva and Matty. 

'Eva is a shadow of her former self.' 

She added: 'As Eva's parent I have watched how the desire for a child has affected every part of who she is. 

'Eva has lost her confidence and self-esteem... she is depressed, angry, and always emotionally fragile.' 

Patricia explains that the couple accept IVF has no guarantee of success but they would love the opportunity to try - if they can raise the money to pay for it.
