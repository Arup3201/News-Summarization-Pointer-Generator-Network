A hacker who reportedly posed as a billionaire heiress after breaking into her personal email account managed to steal more than $500,000.

Candia Fisher, 64, of Manhattan, New York, is part of the Fisher Brothers real estate family and most of her business is conducted online.

But a hacker managed to get so much personal information from her email account that he stole a total of $548,725, reported the New York Post.

The thief posed as Ms Fisher and reportedly ordered her secretary to wire huge amounts of cash overseas to Australian banks at least six times.

A financial secretary at the firm eventually questioned Ms Fisher about the transfers on Monday - but the billionaire was unaware of any of them.

A company security investigator then called police. A source said Ms Fisher is always relying on emails for her business communications.

'It’s easy for someone to learn lots of things about her if they get access to them,' the source told the New York Post.

Now authorities are desperately trying to stop the last wire transfer that was made - which was for an eye-watering $176,000.

But they don’t yet know if they will be able to get any of the money back. A family spokesman would not comment to the New York Post.

Ms Fisher owns two homes in Connecticut and helped produce the Broadway show ‘Equus’, which starred Daniel Radcliffe.

Her mother Emily Fisher Landau was a victim of theft in Manhattan in the 1960s - losing diamonds, rubies and other gems worth millions of dollars.

Fisher Brothers was founded in 1915 as a New York residential building company and expanded to commercial construction in the 1950s.
