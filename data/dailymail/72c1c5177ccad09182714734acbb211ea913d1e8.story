The extreme weather Australia has been facing in recent years could be having a detrimental effect on honey supplies.

Due to a combination of bushfires and severe drought the country's bee population is down 30 per cent, forcing honey producers to put exports on hold and leave supermarkets in short supply.

Ben McKee, managing director of Capilano Honey, told the Sydney Morning Herald that prices are on the rise due to the shortage but that was not a solution for the dwindling supplies.

'Honey prices have increased but there is no great result...because honey is physically not being produced. It doesn't exist. You can't buy what doesn't exist.'

Hone supplies are short due to sharp decreases in the bee population caused by extreme weather

Internationally, Capilano has imported honey from Argentina, Canada, China, and Europe to cover their demand, and downsized their packages back home according to the publication.

Beechworth Honey is also reportedly forecasting a significant decline in their figures, pulling their products from shelves in China before Christmas last year.

The company's owner and director, Jodie Goldsworthy, told the Herald without bees our food choices would shrink to 'some grains, fish and grapes, that's about it'.

The intensity of last summers heatwaves combined with the volume of flower blossoms declining is to be blamed for the shortage.

Globally, a similar trend is occurring, though shrinking honey supplies is just the tip of the iceberg.

Honeybees are the world's leading and most important pollinators, and are depended upon for at least a third of the world's food supply.

Beekeepers in the United States and across Europe have reported similar declines with annual hive losses of around 30 percent or higher over the past decade.

The loss of bees around the world is being called the Honeybee Colony Collapse Disorder, and in the US the Agriculture Department is funding research on bee disease to try and halt the disappearance and unexplained death of these vital insects.
