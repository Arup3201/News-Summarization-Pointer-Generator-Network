Senator John Faulkner says the late Gough Whitlam was a great friend and mentor who he regularly shared a 'cuppa or glass of Passiona' with.

The federal Labour caucus gathered in Canberra on Tuesday morning to remember the former prime minister who passed away aged 98. 

Mr Faulkner, who joined the party when Whitlam was opposition leader, said his condolence speech to the caucus was the most difficult he had ever made.

Senator John Faulkner said his condolence speech to the caucus on Tuesday about his friend Gough Whitlam was the most difficult he had ever made

'Gough Whitlam was a towering figure in our lives and in our party,' he said. 

'Gough and I were close for more years than I care to remember. When I was in Sydney I would go and have a cuppa or a glass of Passiona with Gough in his office. He came into that office four days a week until the last week or two of his life.

'He was so ambitious for our party and so ambitious for Australia. He was an inspiration to a generation of Australians - I'm one of them.

'He was a great parliamentarian, a great leader, a great Australian and, for so many of us and it's what makes it so hard, he was a great friend and mentor.'

Faulkner told the story of Mr Whitlam's reaction when a documentary the pair had made to mark the 50th anniversary of the 1972 election was nominated for a Logie. 

When Senator Faulkner passed on the news that the Logie had gone to another film, Mr Whitlam was 'crestfallen for at least five seconds'. 

'He said to me: 'Comrade, I suppose an academy award is out of the question?'.

'In that film, as he often did, Gough talked for many hours about his life, career, goals and hopes for Australia. 

'One thing he always kept returning to time and again, and we should never forget this, was his belief that politics was an honourable profession.'

Mr Faulkner spoke of his first election campaign back when Whitlam swept to power.

'My first election campaign as a very active young party member was in 1972 when 23 years of conservative government was swept away and of course "It's Time" became part of our language,' he said.

'I will never forget the excitement and the enthusiasm of that election and neither will so many others who... knew that the surging tide of Labor support was not only about a change of government but about changing the country for the better.'

Labor leader Bill Shorten told the caucus on Tuesday that Whitlam had maintained a 'certain grandeur' to the end.

'Gough's was a truly Australian life and a life lived truly for Australia - be it in uniform, or in parliament, in the prime ministership and around the world,' he said.

'Gough did not just want to serve our nation, he wanted to transform it utterly and permanently and he most certainly did.'

Bill Shorten and John Faulkner agreed Whitlam was an ambitious force for Australia

Whitlam, who was a caucus member for 26 years, re-imagined Australia as a 'prosperous, modern, multicultural nation where opportunity belonged to everyone'.

Despite the sacking of his government in 1975, the former prime minister did not carry an 'anvil of hatred'.

'In defending tolerance and defending democracy, Whitlam defined his character and his values and our nation's,' Mr Shorten said.

Reflecting on the famous 'It's Time' election campaign, Mr Shorten said it was always time for being more generous and inclusive.

'It's always time for courage and leadership to create and seize opportunity.' 

The caucus passed a resolution marking the life of the former prime minister and stood for a minute's silence.
