A 17-year-old student has been found dead in a Texas hotel room just hours after celebrating her prom with school friends.

Jacqueline Gomez's boyfriend called 911 at about 11am on Saturday to report that the teenager had stopped breathing.

The couple had booked into Houston's Hyatt Hotel, where other students were also staying, at about 11pm. It is believed they had been drinking in their room before falling asleep.

Tragic loss: Jacqueline Gomez was found dead in a hotel room after celebrating her prom

An autopsy has been carried out but the results have not yet been delivered. Police said there were no signs of trauma and that her boyfriend, who has not been identified, is not a suspect.

'The
 boyfriend stated to us they had been drinking alcohol prior to going to
 sleep,' an officer working on the case said.

According to KHOU 11, police found alcohol and prescription painkillers in the hotel room, and said that Jacqueline had been found dead in the bed.

Her boyfriend was taken in for questioning, but only so detectives could try to understand what had happened.

'He was there. He knows everything, so we’re just continually wanting to find out what happened,' Detective Mike Miller said.

The unexpected death has shocked 
Jacqueline's classmates at Aldine ISD MacArthur High School, who only 
hours earlier had attended the prom with her.

'It's shocking. I can't believe it. I 
mean, really, I can't believe it,' Leandra 
Mendez, a 19-year-old classmate of Jacqueline's, told the Houston Chronicle.

In the weeks leading up to the prom, which was held in the same hotel where Jacqueline's body was found, the teenager had been planning her dress with friends.

Briana Hernandez, who worked at a store with Jacqueline, said prom was all the teenager had talked about for the past few weeks. 

'Every day she would come to work and talk about it. She was so excited to go to prom,' Miss Hernandez told Click2Houston.

She added that Jacqueline, 'who always came to work with a smile' had sent a picture of her in the hotel room just hours before she died.

Investigation: Jacqueline's boyfriend called police on Saturday morning. The couple were staying in the Hyatt in Houston, which was the prom venue

Jacqueline,
 who was described as hard-working and outgoing, told friends she 
planned to spend the night with her date after the dance.

She arrived at the Hyatt at about 8pm, in a dress covered in silver sequins, and spent time with her friends before leaving.

When she got ready to leave with her date, who is believed to have been a fellow classmate, her friends claim they asked her to stay.

'I told her right before left ... "Just please be safe, Jackie". And I gave her a hug, and
 she left,' her friend Justice Gonzalez said.

Jacqueline had been due to attend Lone Star College, where she planned to study to become a pharmacy technician.
