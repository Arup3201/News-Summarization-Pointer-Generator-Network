Three weeks before Jessica Hernandez was shot and killed by Denver police while driving a stolen car, the 17-year-old had been accused in a separate incident of eluding an officer and resisting arrest, it was revealed today.

State troopers cited Hernandez January 1 for speeding down a highway north of Denver in her mother's car after the girl's driver's license had been revoked.

The citation shows Hernandez was driving 80mph in a 55mph zone, and the trooper noted that she was resisting arrest in a way that risked serious injury to him or others. It does not provide other details of the case.

Earlier incident: Three weeks before Jessica Hernandez was shot and killed by Denver police while driving a stolen car, the 17-year-old had been accused of speeding and resisting arrest

Denver police say Jessica drove a stolen car at two of the department's officers, hitting one of them in the leg

Colorado State Patrol Trooper Josh Lewis would not comment on the case.  Hernandez's uncle, Alberto Hernandez, referred questions to an attorney who did not immediately return a call seeking comment.

Court records show the Adams County district attorney's office had the citation dismissed after Hernandez died.

Police say Hernandez was shot dead Monday after she drove a stolen car toward an officer in a residential alley in Denver.

The Denver shooting also brought protests and a demand for a special prosecutor. On Friday, Hernandez's family called for a federal civil rights investigation into her death.

In a statement released in English and Spanish, Hernandez's parents said they want the US Department of Justice to investigate her death, and for US Attorney John Walsh in Colorado to oversee the criminal investigation of the officers involved.

The family said it doesn't trust Denver police to conduct a fair and timely investigation, and that the department has a history of exonerating its officers. 

The statement came after the parents retained lawyer Qusair Mohamedbhai, who has been involved in a number of other high-profile civil rights cases against Denver police and sheriff's deputies.

Mohamedbhai represented a former Denver jail inmate to whom the city paid $3.3million in July to settle a jail abuse lawsuit.

The allegations in the lawsuit filed by Jamal Hunter were so egregious they prompted a federal judge to request a U.S. Department of Justice investigation into the city's police and the sheriff's departments. 

In the shooting of Hernandez, Police Chief Robert White has said the two officers repeatedly told her and four other teens to get out of the stolen car.

White said Thursday an officer might have been injured trying to get out of the way of the vehicle. He initially said the two officers opened fire after one was struck by the car. The incident remained under investigation.

A passenger in the car, who spoke to The Associated Press on condition of anonymity because of safety concerns, has disputed that account, saying the officers did not yell commands before they shot Hernandez through the driver's side window.

The passenger also claimed that Hernandez lost control of the vehicle because she was unconscious after being shot. 

White said it's too soon to judge whether Officers Daniel Greene, a 16-year-veteran, and Gabriel Jordan, a nine-year-veteran of the force, acted appropriately in shooting Hernandez. Jordan suffered a fractured leg.

No one has been charged with the theft of the car, a 2000 Honda Civic that was reported missing Sunday night in Federal Heights.

Laura Sonya Rosales Hernandz, Jessica's mother, on Wednesday called for an independent autopsy on her daughter because she does not trust the official investigation.

The request came as the Denver Police Department and an independent city official who monitors the agency disclosed that separate investigations were underway into policies regarding officers shooting at moving vehicles.

Mrs Hernandez, a mother of six, said: 'I want another autopsy on my daughter so we can know how much damage they did.'

'I want to know, how did this happen? I want to know everything.' 

Hernandez's mother said her daughter made a mistake by 'grabbing' a car that did not belong to her but didn't deserve to pay with her life.

She said: 'How much do they need to investigate?' 

'It's all done. They did it. They killed her. All I want is justice. 

The grieving mother also criticized the way police handled her daughter after she was shot.

She said: 'They dragged her on the floor and threw her down like a piece of garbage,'

The shooting was the fourth time in seven months that Denver police have fired at a moving vehicle after perceiving it as a threat.

Department policy encourages officers to move out of the way of a moving car rather than use their firearm. But it also allows them to shoot if they have no other reasonable way to prevent death or serious injury.

The incidents have prompted the department and the city's independent monitor to review policies and training related to such shootings.

Investigators in the Denver case will be relying on witnesses and police accounts because the department has only just started to buy body cameras for its officers and Jordan and Greene were not yet outfitted. 

Denver does not use in-car dashboard cameras.

Prosecutors promised a thorough probe of the shooting as a group of angry protesters demanded swift answers and called for a special prosecutor to investigate the death earlier this week. 

A vigil in the alleyway in which the teenager was shot dead was also held.

The US Supreme Court has held that officers may not use deadly force to stop a fleeing suspect unless the person is believed to pose significant physical harm. 

Policies vary and some departments have banned or discouraged the practice. 

The police department and independent monitor Nicholas Mitchell are both looking at how national standards compare to Denver's policy.

The city currently allows officers to fire at moving cars if they have no other reasonable way to prevent death or serious injury.

Denver's policy urges officers to try to move out of the way rather than fire.

It states: 'An officer threatened by an oncoming vehicle shall, if feasible, move out of the way rather than discharging a firearm.'

Experts say shooting and disabling a driver can send a car out of control.
