Grant Harrold, a former butler of Prince Charles, has settled out of court with the Royal Household after claiming he was unfairly sacked

Prince Charles has agreed a secret out-of-court settlement with one of his most trusted servants who claimed he was bullied and compared to shotgun killer Raoul Moat before being unfairly dismissed.

Under butler Grant Harrold said he was forced out of his £24,000-a-year post looking after the heir to the throne and his wife, the Duchess of Cornwall, at Highgrove, their country estate, last year.

This happened after he refused to go to work for them at Clarence House, their official residence in London.

In legal papers submitted to an employment tribunal last year, Mr Grant, 34, who had served the prince since 2004, said he was intimidated, threatened and treated as a ‘pariah’ by senior colleagues as a result, despite an ‘exemplary’ record.

Eventually he was diagnosed by his doctor with ‘Phobic Anxiety Depersonalisation Syndrome’, which, it was said, caused him to suffer panic attacks when he was in a big city for any length of time.

This led one unidentified member of the Royal Household to describe Mr Harrold as being ‘too dangerous’ to work with the prince and to ban him from direct contact with the Royals.

They are also said to have likened him to shotgun killer Raoul Moat, who sparked one of the biggest police manhunts in recent times when he attacked his ex-girlfriend and murdered her new partner.

He also blinded policeman David Rathband, who hanged himself  earlier this year. Moat eventually killed himself during a stand-off with police.

When Mr Harrold launched his compensation claim last year Clarence House insisted that the post of under butler had been made redundant and that a relocation package had been made available to Mr Harrold but he declined.

‘We will be rebutting Mr Harrold’s claim,’ they said.

However the Mail has now learned that the Household has backed down on their threat, settled out of court with the former servant and expressed its ‘regret’ for the distress caused to him.

It is thought they were keen to settle in light of the damage caused to the prince’s public image by his former secretary, Elaine Day, who took him to an employment tribunal in 2004.

Miss Day lost her claim for unfair dismissal, after claiming that the prince ran an ‘Edwardian’ household in which anyone who ‘didn’t know their place’ risked victimisation.

Clarence House yesterday confirmed that Mr Harrold’s case was settled ‘amicably’ before it reached the tribunal but declined to comment further.

A spokesman for the former butler, who still lives in a cottage on the Highgrove estate with his partner, who also works for the Prince, said: ‘Mr Harrold and the Household have reached a mutually acceptable agreement on confidential terms in order to bring to an end the Employment Tribunal proceedings and other matters relating to Mr Harrold’s employment.

‘The Household regrets the upset caused to Mr Harrold when he was made redundant.’

Mr Harrold told the Mail that while he could not discuss details of the case, he wanted to make clear that he had the highest regard for Charles and Camilla personally.

Since the conclusion of his action against the royal household he has started his own business, Nicholas Veitch, which organises fine dining events, etiquette dinners and butlering tuition.

The Scot from a council estate in Airdrie, North Lanarkshire, said he had dreamed of working for the Royal Family after watching TV documentaries such as Elizabeth R.

‘My father worked in the storerooms for British Gas and my mother had a series of jobs until she got a post as a housekeeper at a big country house in Scotland when I was 18,’ he said

‘I began working alongside the butler there.'

In the late-1990s, Mr Harrold applied to work for the 13th Duke of Bedford at Woburn Abbey after watching the BBC series filmed there, Country House, and featured several times in subsequent series.

After three years he was poached by Prince Charles after his brother, who worked as a footman for the Queen, recommended him.

The future king interviewed him personally and Mr Harrold was so well liked by his royal boss that it was even suggested he was being groomed to become Prince William’s valet.

‘When you are a butler you are working with your employer in a very intimate capacity, so they have to be able to trust you,’ he said.

‘It was the best job anyone could have had.

‘I met the Queen on several occasions and even danced a Reel and Six with her and the Prince of Wales at one of the Ghillies Balls at Balmoral. It was one of the most amazing moments of my life.

‘It was also at Balmoral that I almost ran over one of the Queen’s corgis when I was invited out to ride on the estate. Her Majesty was standing there, in her headscarf, and fortunately just smiled at me.’

Mr Harrold said the demand for his services since leaving the prince’s employ had been overwhelming.

‘The most popular service is teaching people dining etiquette, hosting dinner parties and afternoon teas and the like. Even in this day and age there is huge demand for it.’
