Modou Barrow has joined Nottingham Forest on loan from Swansea City until the end of the season.

Swansea manager Garry Monk was keen for the winger to get first-team football having seen Jefferson Montero return from his hamstring injury.

The 22-year-old has impressed significantly since joining from Swedish club Ostersunds last September and quickly landed an improved four-year contract last month.

Club staff have been surprised by his progress, but having made only one Premier League start this season it has been deemed necessary to send him to the Championship club for extra experience.

Forest boss Dougie Freedman took Barrow on trial at Bolton last summer, but was unsuccessful in an attempt to sign him.
