Retired Australian cricketer Mike Hussey will once again take to the pitch - for one match, at least - when he captains a Prime Minister's XI side against England in January.

The match will be played on January 14 at Manuka Oval, four days before England's opening match of a one-day international tri-series that also includes Australia and India.

Hussey played 79 tests for Australia from 2005 to 2013 and 185 one-day internationals from 2004 to 2012. His career included 19 centuries among 6,235 test runs.

Mike Hussey played in 79 tests for Australia and 185 one-day internationals before retiring in 2012

Former players Ricky Ponting and Brett Lee have appeared as PM's XI captains in the past two years 'so it's humbling to follow in the footsteps of two icons of Australian cricket,' says Hussey.

The remainder of the team will be announced later.
