David Miliband today put himself at odds with his Labour leader brother Ed to warn that international intervention in Syria is ‘increasingly necessary’.

The former foreign secretary condemned the failure of western governments including Britain to ‘break the diplomatic and military deadlock’ and warned humanitarian aid cannot reach refugees because aid agencies are coming under ‘aerial bombardment’.

His warning that Syria risks becoming a ‘dangerous no-man’s-land’ like Afghanistan appears at odds with Ed Miliband’s insistence that Labour will not back a second vote on UK military intervention.

There have been growing signs of division in Labour ranks since David Cameron’s call for action was rejected by a majority of 13 MPs in the Commons last week.

Some 30 Tory rebels as well as nine Liberal Democrats joined with Labour to inflict a humiliating defeat on the Prime Minister.

Amid growing signs of Labour disarray over the stance taken last week by Ed Miliband – who is accused of indicating support for the Government only to pull the plug at the last minute – Shadow Cabinet ministers Jim Murphy and Chuka Umunna suggested a second vote may be needed.

But last night a senior Labour source warned: ‘We caution against any idea of a rerun of a Syria vote.'

It is thought that some on the Labour frontbench were spooked by polls showing the public was overwhelmingly against another British military foray in the Middle East.

David Miliband, who lost out on the Labour leadership to his brother three years ago, quit the Commons to become chief executive of New York-based aid charity International Rescue Committee.

In an article for the Financial Times, he argued that the unpopularity of international action in Syria was not an excuse for inaction.

He said: ‘It is clear that, while international engagement is decreasingly popular in the advanced democracies, a multipolar world makes it increasingly necessary.

‘Humanitarian intervention is about human need, not political sides – but it has political consequences.

‘There is capacity to save more lives, but this needs resources and political will. The drums of war are reason to redouble humanitarian efforts, not forget them.’

It comes after it emerged the Syrian civil war has now forced 2million refugees to flee the country.

The UN High Commissioner for Refugees described the conflict as 'the great tragedy of this century' as he laid bare the scale of the suffering it has caused, with more than 1million children forced out of their homeland.

In addition to those who have left Syria during the two-and-a-half-year war, 4.25million people have been displaced within the country.

In total, around a third of the population have been forced to leave their homes, meaning the conflict has prompted the world's biggest refugee crisis.

Recall: There were calls of 'resign' from the Labour benches before David Cameron told the Commons that Britain would play no part in military action against Syria

He insisted that ‘none of the military options being canvassed – or, in the UK, rejected – promises a decisive shift in the course of the conflict’.

An audit by the IRC reveals a grim ‘litany of suffering’, adding: ‘The dynamics are all going in the wrong direction and the prospects are bleak.

‘For geopolitical reasons, as well as basic humanity, we need a fundamental step change in the scale of effort.’

US President Barack Obama today said he was confident that Congress would back his plan for intervention in Syria.

But he said he was ready to change the language of the motion to ensure it attracted widespread support.

The President said: 'So long as we 
are accomplishing what needs to be accomplished, which is to send a 
clear message to Assad, to degrade his capabilities to use chemical 
weapons, not just now but also in the future, as long as the 
authorization allows us to do that, I'm confident that we're going to be
able to come up with something that hits that mark.'

And Mr Obama insisted: 'This is not Iraq, and this is not Afghanistan.'

French president Francoise 
Hollande said he would to wait for the US Congress decision on military 
action in Syria before deciding on any action France might take.

Meanwhile Michael Gove today accused Labour MPs 
of behaving like fans at a ‘football match’ cheering at the result of 
the Commons vote against military action in Syria.

The
Education Secretary condemned the Ed Miliband’s party for ‘celebrating’
at a time when ‘children had been killed by a ruthless dictator’.

But
the bitter recriminations of the vote continued, with Labour claiming 
Mr Gove’s comments were ‘puerile, stupid and grossly offensive’.

The
unexpected defeat by just 13 votes on Thursday night was the first time
since 1782 that a government had lost a vote on war and peace.

Furious: Michael Gove, pictured entering Number 10 today, stepped up his criticism of Labour MPs in the wake of last week's Syria vote

In
the corridors of Parliament afterwards Mr Gove, a staunch backer of 
military action in Syria, shouted 'you're a disgrace' at those MPs who 
opposed the Government in the tense vote.

Today the Cabinet Minister admitted he had become ‘heated’ but stepped up his criticism of the behaviour of Labour MPs.

There
were cheers and shouts of ‘resign’ from the Labour benches as the 
result – 285 votes to 272 – was announced to a shocked House of Commons.

Mr Gove told BBC Breakfast: ‘I did become heated last week, that is absolutely right.

‘At
the moment that the Government lost the vote on the motion, there were 
Labour MPs cheering as though it were a sort of football match and they 
had just won.

‘At the same time on the news, we were hearing about an attack on a school in Syria and the death toll there rising.

‘And
the incongruity of Labour MPs celebrating as children had been killed 
by a ruthless dictator, I am afraid got to me and I did feel incredibly 
emotional. I do feel emotional about this subject.’

The remarks lay bare the depth of anger in the government at the way Labour approached the vote.

But Labour Party vice-chairman Michael Dugher said Mr Gove’s comments were ‘grossly offensive’.

‘Michael Gove's comments today are puerile, stupid & grossly offensive,’ the MP wrote on Twitter.

‘A desperate, low and partisan attack that demeans his office.’
