Novak Djokovic wasted no time in booking his place in the last 32 of the Australian Open as the world No 1 dropped just five games against Andrey Kuznetsov.

Djokovic was imperious as he beat world No 88 Kuznetsov 6-0, 6-1, 6-4 in just one hour and 24 minutes to seal a third-round clash with Fernando Verdasco or Go Soeda.

The four-time Melbourne champion has lost just two sets in his first and second round matches here since 2007 and feels that a combination of factors make this tournament the best of the four majors for him.

The Serb said: 'Generally this is my most successful grand slam and the tournament where over the years I've performed my best tennis. I think there is not one reason, [more] a few reasons together.

'Probably the fact that I enjoy the conditions of play. Even though the last two years the courts have played faster, significantly faster than they were before, still I do enjoy being here in Australia. Some nice, positive, easy-going, sport-oriented energy going around. People appreciate the sport and make you feel good.

'Of course, it's the beginning of the year. It's the first big tournament. Everybody comes fresh and motivated. I guess in this kind of package it's a combination of things that make me feel comfortable on the court here.'

Immediately from the off, Djokovic did not look as if he would drop a set on Thursday as he raced to a one-set lead without losing a game in just 21 minutes, making just two unforced errors.

Kuznetsov, 23, finally got on the board in the 10th game of the match but that was the Russian's only success in the second set as Djokovic served up his seventh ace to ease to a two-set lead.

The Rod Laver Arena crowd gave Kuznetsov a cheer as he surprisingly broke for a 2-0 lead in the third set after a Djokovic double fault but it didn't last long as Djokovic immediately broke back and went on to secure progression.

Djokovic said: 'The first two sets definitely have been great. Overall I executed the game plan. Everything I intended to do, almost 100 per cent, from every second in my game, serve, baseline play, aggressive shots and aggressive returns.

'He dropped his first-serve percentage a lot in the second set and obviously allowed me to have a lot of looks at the second serves. That, as well, gave me an opportunity to step in and just swing through the ball.'

Djokovic, 27, is bidding to become only the second man to win the Australian Open five times, with Aussie Roy Emerson still holding the record after winning the title six times in the 1960s.
