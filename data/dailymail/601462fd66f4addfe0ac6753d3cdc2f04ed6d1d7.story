Gareth Bale marked his return to the Real Madrid starting line-up by scoring after just nine minutes in a convincing 5-1 win over Rayo Vallecano that gave Carlo Ancelotti’s team their 13th straight victory.

The Welshman, who also hit the crossbar in the second half, has seen Madrid win their last seven games as he recovered from a Gluteus injury and some supporters have made no secret of the desire to seem the team left unchanged but he came in for Isco on Saturday night at the Santiago Bernabeu and helped Real to yet another comfortable win.

Cristiano Ronaldo played Toni Kroos in behind the Rayo Vallecano defence and the German midfielder crossed from the left for Bale to swoop at the back post and convert the centre for the opener.

Real Madrid: Navas 5, Nacho 6, Pepe 8, Ramos 7, Marcelo 7, Kroos 9, Modric 8, Bale 7, Rodriguez 6, Ronaldo 7, Benzema 7

Goals: Bale 9, Ramos 40, Kroos 56, Benzema 59, Ronaldo 83

Rayo Vallecano: Alvarez 6, Tito 6, Ze Castro 5, Ba 5, Insua 6, Fatau 6, Trashorras 6, Lica 6, Bueno 6, Kakuta 6, Baptistao 7

Goal: Bueno 44

Real Madrid doubled their lead just before the break when James Rodriguez's corner from the right dropped for Sergio Ramos, who hooked the ball in with his knee after Pepe failed to reach it.

Real looked to be cruising at this point but Rodriguez blotted his copybook with a poor back pass that appeared to allow Rayo back into the game just before the half-time whistle.

The Colombian had time on the ball but rolled it back to goalkeeper Keylor Navas and Leo Baptistao stole in and crossed for Alberto Bueno to bring Rayo back into the match. 

The Madrid-based minnows are famed for combining fine attacking football with kamikaze defending and so it had been in the first 45 minutes but at least they kept 17-goal Cristiano Ronaldo quiet. The Portuguese forward had showed off his Golden Shoe trophy at the start of the match but failed to add to his season’s tally in the first 45 minutes of the game. 

Rayo had looked bright going forward with former Chelsea winger Gael Kakuta, who was give his debut at Stamford Bridge by Ancelotti in 2009, seeing plenty of the ball.

At the start of the second half Rayo looked to have equalised when Leo Baptistao had the ball in the back of the net only to see it chalked off for a marginal offside.

Real went straight down the other end and made it 3-1 and the goal was the pick of the bunch.

Ronaldo crossed from the right and Kroos passed the ball into the back of the net with the smoothest of finishes that curled just inside the post and beyond Cristian Alvarez’s dive.

Within four minutes it was four and another very close offside call went against Rayo. Karim Benzema was the wrong side of the last Rayo defender when Roanldo crossed from the right; the linesman’s flag should have been raised but he was not up with play and Benzema celebrated his sixth league goal of the season.

Rayo had only won once in 15 games in the Santiago Bernabeu and this was not going to be their night either. Bale’s perfectly weighted pass found Ronaldo and it might easily have been five. Bale then thundered a shot in from the edge of the area which Alvarez palmed on to his crossbar.

All that was missing was a goal from Real’s top scorer Ronaldo and with five minutes left it came with a shot that squirmed under Alvarez’s body after Benzema had intelligently held the ball up while the Portuguese came back from an offside position.

Rayo had lost this fixture 5-0 last season so they are getting closer to getting something from the fixture. Not much closer though. The consolation is that at the moment they are not the only team who cannot live with this Madrid side.
