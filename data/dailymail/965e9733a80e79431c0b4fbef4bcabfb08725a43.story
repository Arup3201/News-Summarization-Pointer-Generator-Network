Sam Allardyce is usually a white wine man but, on the eve of his 60th birthday, the West Ham manager won’t mind knocking back these Clarets.

Allardyce certainly has plenty to celebrate after this win. Not only are his team flying high in the Premier League table after a fourth Premier League win in eight games, they have reached those heights playing a brand of football not readily associated with him during his time in charge at Bolton and Blackburn down the road from Turf Moor.

Victory here did not come easily in a hugely entertaining game, however. Burnley raised hopes of their first win of the season during a first half in which Kieran Trippier and George Boyd were outstanding.

But two goals in five minutes after the break from Diafra Safro – with his sixth in as many games – and Enner Valencia put Allardyce’s team in control. Boyd pulled one back but substitute Carlton Cole’s header made sure that Allardyce will have a very happy birthday on Sunday.

He said: ‘I told the players before the game, “come on lads, I need a result because it’s my birthday and if we don’t get one it’s not going to be very pleasing even though I’m out with my old mates tonight”.

‘We’re only eight games in and I just hope it continues. If we’re in the top half in December, we can think about maintaining that for the rest of the season.’

Burnley had last season’s 26-goal top scorer Danny Ings back after a three-game absence to liven up their goal-starved attack – just four in eight league games now – and it certainly appeared to have the desired effect as they twice went close to taking the lead within the first eight minutes.

There were less than two minutes on the clock when Trippier’s cross took a deflection off Aaron Cresswell and looped up towards Boyd just inside the box. In one motion, the former Hull player took the ball on his chest and away from James Collins before letting fly with a first-time volley which beat goalkeeper Adrian but came back off the underside of the bar.

Then Lukas Jutkiewicz thought he had scored his first goal of the season when he tapped home close-range after Ings’s jinking run and low shot had brought a one-handed save from Adrian, but the big Burnley striker was clearly a couple of yards offside and it did not count.

The Clarets continued to press with Trippier a constant threat down the right, and it was from another of his crosses that Jutkiewicz headed narrowly over under pressure from Collins.

It was a similar story in the 29th minute when Jutkiewicz headed over after great work on the right by Boyd, but this time he had Michael Kightly arriving unmarked at the far post behind him and the winger’s frustration was plain to see.

Burnley’s enterprise and energy kept West Ham pinned in their own half for long periods, but the visitors did go close twice in the space of five minutes with Stewart Downing involved on both occasions.

Downing is revelling in the free role he has been given by Allardyce this season, and it was his cross from the right in the 25th minute that created a great chance for in-form Sakho but the Senegal striker somehow planted is header wide at the near post under pressure from Jason Shackell.

Then Downing popped up on the other wing and stepped inside Shackell before trying his luck from a tight angle with a curling effort that clipped Tom Heaton’s far post.

There was always a chance that Burnley would live to regret not taking their chances, and so it proved as West Ham struck twice in the space of five minutes after the interval.

Both goals came from fantastic crosses from their fullbacks, and both were wonderfully despatched by Sakho and Valencia.

Sakho’s was his sixth in as many games as he arrived ahead of Shackell to meet Cresswell’s cross from the left and power a header past Heaton in the 49th minute. ‘He’s a bargain and if the transfer fee was £4.5million, with all the top-ups it’s still a bargain,’ said Allardyce. ‘This lad has been very exciting and he’s excited the rest of the players.’

A red flare landed on the pitch in the celebrations that followed, thrown from the West Ham fans behind the goal, and the smoke had only just cleared when they were applauding a second.

Alex Song made a surging run upfield and fed Carl Jenkinson, and his equally good ball from the right picked out Valencia who rose above Michael Duff to head home.

That should have knocked the stuffing out of Burnley. Instead it was the trigger for a stirring fightback.

No sooner had Tripper cleared Cole’s effort off the line than Ings broke upfield to force a corner. Kightly’s delivery was held up in the wind and Adrian made a mess of catching it under pressure from Ings, allowing Boyd to fire home in the scramble that followed.

Ings was inches away from equalising moments later when he met another wonderful cross from Trippier with a header that flew wide, but West Ham finally made sure with a third goal in the 70th minute.

Burnley boss Sean Dyche said: ‘It’s a harsh reality in the Premier League that you have to take your chances.’ 

Cole’s header was not quite as impressive as the others as he got in ahead of Heaton to nod home from close-range after Sahko had turned Downing’s corner back across goal, and there was still time for substitute Ashley Barnes to hit the bar for Burnley, but Big Sam won’t be complaining as he enjoys that glass of wine.
