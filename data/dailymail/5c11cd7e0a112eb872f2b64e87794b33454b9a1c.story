Police brought in a mobile surveillance van to prevent Stephen Lawrence’s memorial being vandalised yesterday.

Cameras were positioned on the black marble plaque which marks the spot where the teenager died in Well Hall Road, Eltham, south-east London, in 1993.

Officers acted after passing motorists spat racial abuse at mourners who came to leave flowers on Tuesday after Gary Dobson and David Norris were found guilty of his murder.

The memorial is yards from Dobson’s home at the time of the murder in Phineas Pett Road. The rest of the gang were seen running away down Dickson Road after Stephen was stabbed.

One visitor said: ‘It was really bad here
last night as emotion was running high and there were a lot of comments
shouted from cars.

Victim: Stephen Lawrence who was stabbed to death in April 1993

‘The police van came down this morning and that’s seemed to stop it. The cameras on the top of it are probably the main deterrent, but you just don’t know what people will do.’

Dozens of bouquets were placed around the memorial – mostly by people who did not know the 18-year-old A-level student. One read: ‘The start of justice for the murder of an innocent young man. RIP Stephen.’ Another had written: ‘Two down. Three to go. Rest in peace.’

The plaque has been targeted three times in the 16 years since it was placed at the site of the stabbing.

On one occasion it was chipped and it has also had paint and flammable liquids poured on it. A permanent camera has been installed on the other side of the road.

Last month, father-of-three Paul Peters, 33, was cleared of racially aggravated criminal damage after dropping a bottle on to the plaque which smashed.

Peters claimed he did not remember what happened because he was so drunk.
