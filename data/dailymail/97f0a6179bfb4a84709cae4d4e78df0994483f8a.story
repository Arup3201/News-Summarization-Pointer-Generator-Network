As Gareth Bale guided a shot past Israel goalkeeper Ofir Marciano in the 77th minute on Saturday evening, Wales fans could be forgiven for getting a little carried away.

Not only with their side's impressive victory - a 3-0 win over the Group B leaders away from home - but with the continuing brilliance of their two-goal talisman.

Bale's double in Haifa and assist for Aaron Ramsey sent Chris Coleman's men top of their Euro 2016 qualifying group to give supporters hope of a first appearance at a major finals since 1958.

But as well as strengthening Wales' chances of a trip to France next summer, Bale's performance served to further enhance his reputation as a Dragons legend in the making.

After months of criticism in Spain, the Real Madrid forward reminded everyone of his ability with a clever header to set up Ramsey, stunning free-kick to make it 2-0 and powerful finish to kill Israel off.

Still only 25, Bale already has more goals (16) than Wales greats John Charles (15) and Ryan Giggs (12). And with a place at the European Championships at stake, the former Tottenham man has the perfect opportunity to surpass both in the hearts of fans, too.

It was Charles who led Wales to the World Cup in Sweden 57 years ago, giving the country an all-too-rare chance to test themselves against the best teams on the planet.

They reached the quarter-finals on that occasion, losing narrowly to eventual winners Brazil as Pele grabbed the only goal of the game.

Charles, who scored in a group stage draw with Hungary, missed out on the last-eight clash after being injured against the same opponents in a play-off.

But such was his influence on the team that Wales manager Jim Murphy remarked: 'with John Charles in the side we might have won'.

It was a view backed up by Charles' former international team-mate Terry Medwin in an interview last year. He told BBC Sport: 'Had he (Charles) been fit enough to play, I'm not saying we would have won, but he was such a great player.'

Similarly, it would be hard to imagine where Wales might be without the injection of quality which Bale brings.

Would they have beaten Israel without him in the team? Possibly, but there's no chance it would have been as comfortable a victory as we witnessed on Saturday night.

Giggs can also claim to be among Wales' finest players, having pulled on the famous red shirt on 64 occasions during his distinguished club career with Manchester United.

But he could never quite replicate Charles and drag his country to a major tournament.

Wales would have made it to the 1994 World Cup had they beaten Romania in their final qualifier in November, 1993, but they lost 2-1 at Adams Park. And a decade later they missed out on a place at Euro 2004 after losing 1-0 to Russia in a two-legged play-off.

Speaking after watching his side go top of their group on Saturday, Wales boss Coleman said: 'We nearly did it in 1994 and 2004 and now we have the opportunity to go a step further.

'People say it's a golden generation but we need to earn it. We're doing it but we've not done it yet.

'We want the chance to prove since 1958 this team is as good as anything that's gone before.'

Fire Wales to Euro 2016 and Bale may well be regarded as the greatest Welsh player of all time.
