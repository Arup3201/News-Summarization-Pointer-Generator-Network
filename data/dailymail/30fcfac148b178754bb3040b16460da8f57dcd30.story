The German government is set to scrap its decades-old policy of not spying on key NATO allies – including the U.S. – in response to the latest spy scandal, which exposed a German intelligence officer as a double-agent leaking secret documents to the U.S.

The decision was announced by Thomas de Maizière, an Interior Minister in Chancellor Angela Merkel’s government.

He told the newspaper Bild that Berlin wants ‘360 degree surveillance’ of all intelligence-gathering operations in Germany.

German Chancellor Angela Merkel interrupted a trade visit to China on Monday to describe the latest spying scandal as a 'clear contradiction of the notion of trustworthy co-operation'

After the defeat of the Nazis and the end of World War II in 1945, the new authorities of West Germany adopted a policy of turning a blind eye to the intelligence activities of some of the victors, namely the U.S., Britain and France.

Bild claims to have obtained a document detailing ‘concrete countermeasures’ that the Bundesnachrichtendienst (BND) – Germany’s equivalent of the CIA - plans to implement.

The minister comments were echoed by Stephan Mayer, a domestic security spokesman for Merkel’s ruling Christian Democrats. ‘We must focus more strongly on our so-called allies,’ he said.

The BND ‘double agent’ is reported to have simply emailed Berlin’s American embassy and asked whether officials were interested in ‘co-operation’.

German prosecutors say the 31-year-old man is suspected of selling over 218 top-secret German intelligence documents to his US spymasters in return for cash payments of $13,600 per document between 2012 and 2014.

He was caught by German counter-espionage agents only after he was found offering similar BND documents to Berlin’s Russian embassy. He was arrested last week.

New German counter-espionage measures would almost certainly result in the monitoring of ‘listening posts’, which the National Security Agency (NSA) runs from the roof of its Berlin embassy.

Its existence was revealed last year when evidence supplied by the whistle-blower Edward Snowden revealed that NSA had bugged Chancellor Merkel’s cell phone.

She interrupted a current trade visit to China on Monday to describe the scandal as a ‘very serious development’. She added: ‘It is a clear contradiction of the notion of trustworthy co-operation.’

The White House has said the U.S. will work with Germany to resolve its concerns.

Spokesman Josh Earnest said the U.S. is aware that a German citizen was arrested amid allegations he was purportedly working for the U.S., but he would not say whether the reports are accurate.

However two U.S. officials familiar with the matter confirmed to Reuters on Monday that the CIA was involved in a spying operation against Germany that had led to the alleged recruitment of the German intelligence official.

CIA Director John Brennan has asked to brief key members of the U.S. Congress on the matter.
