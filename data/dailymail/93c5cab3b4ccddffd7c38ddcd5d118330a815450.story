President Obama has again refused to call the battle with terrorism in the Middle East a war against radical Islam.

In his latest interview, the Commander-in-Chief agrees certain factions have perverted the religion having embraced a 'nihilistic, violent, almost medieval interpretation of Islam'

But he insists that such labels hurt efforts to root out radical ideologies in Muslim communities which have been tainted by groups such as ISIS and Al Qaeda.

Defiant: President Obama has once again refused to state that the fight against terror in the Middle East was a religious war because the 'overwhelming' majority of Muslims do not support that interpretation  

Speaking to CNN's Fareed Zakaria, he said: 'There is an element growing out of Muslim communities in certain parts of the world that have perverted the religion.

'They are doing damage in a lot of countries around the world.

'But I reject a notion that somehow creates a religious war because the overwhelming majority of Muslims reject that interpretation of Islam. They don't even recognize it as being Islam.

'I think for us to be successful in fighting this scurge it's very important to align ourselves with the 99.9 per cent of Muslims.'

In January, during a visit from British Prime Minister David Cameron, Obama also refused to call ISIS terrorists Muslims. 

Following the speech is spokesman released a statement saying:  'Let’s call them what they are. These terrorists are individuals who would like to cloak themselves in the veil of a particular religion.

Reasoning: Speaking to CNN' s Fareed Zakaria, he said: 'There is an element growing out of Muslim communities in certain parts of the world that have perverted the religion'. But he rejected the notion it was driven entirely by religion

'But based on the fact that the religious leaders of that religion have roundly condemned their actions, those religious leaders have indicated that their actions are entirely inconsistent with Islam,' he said. 

The U.S. President said he does not consider the threat from ISIS an 'existential' one. 

Earlier this month Senator Lindsey Graham told Fox News: 'We are in a religious war with radical Islamists. When I hear the President of the United States and his chief spokesperson failing to admit that we're in a religious war, it really bothers me

On Tuesday, during a speech in India, Obama told an audience the country could succeed if it wasn't divided by religious lines.
