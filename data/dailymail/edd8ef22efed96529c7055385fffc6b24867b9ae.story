June Whitfield, star of comedy show Terry and June, has criticised BBC executives for turning middle class into a 'dirty word'

She made her name as the star of a quintessential middle class sitcom. So June Whitfield is more than qualified to defend such shows amid claims that BBC bosses think there’s too many of them.

The Terry and June actress, now 88, has attacked the corporation for turning ‘middle class’ into a ‘dirty word’ by concentrating too much on blue collar comedies.

Miss Whitfield, who appears in new BBC1 show Boomers, said it was ‘extraordinary’ that bawdy comedies such as Mrs Brown’s Boys are preferred to gentler shows such as Miranda.

She criticised a recent BBC Trust report which accused BBC1 of ‘playing it safe’ and found viewers from ‘lower social grade audiences’ considered its comedy to be too middle class.

Appearing at the launch of Boomers – which follows the lives of a group of retired friends – Miss Whitfield was asked whether she agreed with the BBC Trust report and felt the middle class should be ‘written off’. 

She replied: ‘No I don’t. It’s one of my big bugbears. There are so many middle class folk about the place that it’s almost become a dirty word. [When they say] “Oh no, it’s too middle class”, what do they mean? They are people.’

Last month the BBC Trust said Miranda, starring Miranda Hart, was an example of the sort of sitcom audiences found too middle class ‘in focus and target audience’.

It highlighted Mrs Brown’s Boys, which stars Irish actor Brendan O’Carroll as a foul-mouthed matriarch, as an example of a successful working-class comedy.

But Miss Whitfield said she disliked such brash and crude comedies. She said: ‘It’s quite extraordinary that everything has to be in your face.’

Speaking at the same event, TV executive Jimmy Mulville – whose production company Hat Trick made Boomers – said the BBC Trust’s findings were ‘very unhelpful’.

He said: ‘To legislate for drama and comedy by saying it is too middle class, too common, too posh – on that basis you’d be doing comedy by slide rule. You’d have no Downton Abbey, you wouldn’t have Outnumbered.’

Miss Whitfield found fame in the 1970s and 1980s in Terry and June. She once supported Tony Hancock and Frankie Howerd, starred in Absolutely Fabulous and has made appearances in Doctor Who and Midsomer Murders.

Miranda was narrowly beaten in the ratings by Mrs Brown’s Boys when the shows went head to head last year. Miranda averaged 7.1million viewers, just short of the 7.3million who watched Mrs Brown’s Boys half an hour later.

The BBC Trust said its report reflected viewers’ opinions and it did not endorse the view that BBC comedy was too middle class.

Boomers starts this Friday on BBC1 at 9pm.
