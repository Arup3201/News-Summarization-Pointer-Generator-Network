A child and two adults were killed and 15 others were hurt when an out-of-control monster truck ploughed into spectators at a car show in the Netherlands.

The tragedy in the eastern city Haaksbergen happened after the truck drove over five parked cars. It veered into the watching crowd, careering into dozens of onlookers.

Panicked spectators, including young children, were forced to dive to safety as the out-sized vehicle ploughed through a guard rail.

The event was held in a car park in the centre of Haaksbergen, a town of 25,000 people.

Hans Gerritsen, mayor of Haaksbergen, said between 15 and 30 people were injured in the accident, five seriously. Three people were killed, including one child, he told local media.

Hundreds of people could only watch as the massive monster truck, with tractor-size wheels, rolled into the packed crowd of spectators.

One local man, whose name was given only as Bob, had a clear view from his window above the car park where the event was held.

He told Dutch broadcaster NOS: 'It was awful to see. It was not too bad in terms of speed. But such truck is so heavy, there is nothing can be done.

'I think people did not have time to jump away. It was too late. I saw many people lying on the ground, and people running there to help. There were also people under the truck.

Air ambulances, paramedics, fire engines and police all attended the scene of the accident. Some emergency services also travelled across from Germany to help with the aftermath. Two nearby hospitals implemented a disaster recovery plan.

The driver has been arrested and was this evening being questioned by police. Officers told NOS the arrest was routine in the circumstances.

The cause of the crash is so far unknown. It has been speculated that the trucks brakes failed or that its accelerator pedal somehow got stuck.

Organisers insisted they had done everything they thought would be needed to ensure the safety of watching crowds.

'We are organizing this for seven years,' said Geerlorf Kanis, president of Star Events Foundation Haaksbergen.

'Each year there is that kind of stunt, a car or a motorcycle., We ensure that there is always enough space, with a safety margin.'
