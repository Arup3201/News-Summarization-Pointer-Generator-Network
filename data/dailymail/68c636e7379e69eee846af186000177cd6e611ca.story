For many travelers, taking pictures is simply part of the experience, but for one frequent flier, his trip almost didn't happen after taking a photo on board his plane.

Matthew Klint, 26, who has racked up nearly a million air miles, was settling into his business class seat from Newark to Istanbul.

Excited after being upgraded, Mr Klint decided to blog about the experience and started clicking away with his iphone. Little did he know he had broken one of United's rules.

Welcome Aboard: But don't take any pictures please! A business class blogger was asked to leave his flight after taking a photo from his seat before takeoff

After taking a picture of the empty seat in front of him, a fight attendant ran over and told him he couldn't take a picture and was escorted from the plane.

Writing about the experience in his travel blog, Mr Klint says he was told the taking of pictures violates United's policy. The policy appears in the in-flight magazine:

The use of still and video cameras, film or digital, including any cellular or other devices that have this capability, is permitted only for recording personal events. Photography or audio or video recording of other customers without their express prior consent is strictly prohibited. Also, unauthorized photography or audio or video recording of airline personnel, aircraft equipment or procedures is always prohibited. Any photography (video or still) or voice or audio recording or transmission while on any United Airlines aircraft is strictly prohibited, except to the extent specifically permitted by United Airlines.

Determined not to be forced from his flight to Turkey Mr Klint begged the flight attendant to let him stay: 'Look, I am a traveler. I am not a terrorist, I write about airline stuff all the time. Here is one of my business cards,' he told her.

It made no difference. A few moments later he was dragged from the plane by one of the gate agents passing the Captain on the way. 'The Captain was quite rude, and he says, essentially, ‘I don’t want to hear you, get off the plane before I call the police.’

Upgraded then offloaded: Matthew Klint, 26, joked to a flight attendant that he was a blogger and not a terrorist. It didn't go down well with the Captain who threatened to call police unless he left the plane

'There were whispers throughout the business class and Economy Plus cabins as I made the walk of shame down the aisle,' Klint wrote on his blog. He called the incident 'traumatizing and highly embarrassing.'

Agents at Newark airport rebooked him onto another flight that left 45 minutes later but it wasn't until he had written about the experience on his blog that management from United Airlines reached out to him.

They offered him what he describes as some modest compensation for the disruption to his travel plans.

No explanation: United rebooked Mr Klint on another flight but have not explained their reasons for removing him from his flight. They say customers can take pictures on board so long as it respects the security and privacy of other customers

United have not commented on why Mr Klint was removed from the aircraft but instead have told Mr Klint that an 'extensive internal investigation' is underway. They have also provided a statement about their policy:

We welcome customers to record their personal experiences on board provided they don’t take photos or videos of customers and crew members without their consent. This is both a security and service measure we take that also respects the privacy of other customers.

Mr Klint has admitted it wasn't his smartest moment to use the word 'terrorist' on the plane, but he says he doesn't want anyone else to experience inconvenience and embarrassment that he has had to endure.
