He has designed wild headgear for the likes of Rihanna, Mick Jagger and Princess Beatrice. But this December Stephen Jones has got a rather more surprising client.

The famed milliner has given Barbie five festive makeovers for Christmas, decking the doll out in cocktail dresses, floor-length gowns and velvet minis.

But for those who thought the £25 they usually have to shell out for their favourite plastic doll was steep, look away now, because Happy Holly Barbie, Toffee Ice Barbie, Snow Globe Barbie, Santa Baby Barbie, and Christmas Tree Barbie all come with a price tag of £250.

It's a doll's life! Famed milliner, Stephen Jones, has given Barbie five festive make-overs for Christmas, including cocktail dresses, floor-length gowns and velvet minis

Speaking about the design project which saw him create total couture looks for each doll, Stephen said: 'Barbie is the most fabulous private client. 

'She came into the salon for her Christmas morning hat and left with five glamorous outfits. Barbie and I have the same design vision; we love tradition, but have an eye for the future.'

Erin Moscow, a spokesperson for Selfridges, who is selling the dolls, said: 'We're enamoured with the idea of truly one-of-a-kind gift this Christmas.

'More than ever before we're aware of the demand for pieces which offer something really special.

Toffee Ice Barbie: Stephen says: 'Rudolph, Prancer and Vixen are some of Santa's reindeers, so I wanted to make Barbie an outfit in which she can dance and prance on the ice rink'

Santa Baby Barbie: Stephen says 'Every Barbie needs a fabulous Christmas outfit, so I used the idea of a Santa hat to make a fantasy cocktail dress, dedicated to Mrs Santa'

'These pieces don't necessarily come with a million pound price tag - they're not about ostentation - their beauty lies in their rarity. 

'All of the storytelling and fantasy of Stephen's work, realised with fun and witticism that's synonymous with Barbie, has gone into these beautiful dolls.'

Born in Cheshire, and schooled in Liverpool, Stephen burst onto the London fashion scene during its explosion of street style in the late seventies. 

Snow Globe Barbie:  Stephen says 'There is nothing more magical and glamorous than floating snowflakes encased in a snow globe'

Happy Holly Barbie: Stephen says 'This is my personal favourite, using the contrast of soft velvet and spiky holly leaves. Barbie also has her very own pet Robin to give her a Christmas peck'

Christmas Tree Barbie: Stephen says 'I ensured the drama and volume of a full pine tree by illuminating
the multicolour baubles within her Christmas tree headpiece'

By day, he was a student at Central 
Saint Martins, while after dark he was one of the era's uncompromising style trailblazers at the legendary Blitz nightclub, always donning a 
striking hat of his own idiosyncratic design. 

By 1980 he had opened his first millinery salon in the heart of Covent Garden, soon to become a regular haunt to the likes of Boy George and Diana, Princess of Wales.

Stephen isn't the first designer to give Barbie a make-over. Over the past fifty years Alaïa, Burberry, Comme des Garçons, Chanel, Louis Vuitton, Prada, and Roksanda Ilincic have dressed her.

Famous fans: Princess Eugenie (L) and Kylie Minogue are fans of his designs

Hats off! Princess Beatrice (L) and Nicole Kidman also love Stephen's headwear
