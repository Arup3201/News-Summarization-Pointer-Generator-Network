Following reports that billions of bee colonies across the world are facing extinction, a team of designers have decided to take matters into their own hands.

The Open Source Beehives project has been set up so beekeepers - both amateur and professional - can print and assemble smart hives that monitor and track the health of bee colonies globally. 

The hives are sold either on their own, or with a sensory kit that sends data to an open platform called Smartcitizen. This data is then analysed by experts in a bid to find a solution to the decreasing bee populations.

A team of Australian scientists plan to mount tiny sensors to 5,000 honey bees and monitor where they fly.

The plan will be the first of its kind to track bees as they move in real-time.

The sensors use radio frequency identification chips and would record when the bee passes a certain point.

This data would then be sent back to Australia's Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation to be analysed.

This sensory kit was developed by Fab Lab 
Barcelona and is an open source platform, including hardware, a website and an app. 

The designs of the open-source hives are based on the traditional look of the Warre Hive, or People’s Hive. 

It is built by adding hives boxes to the bottom of the structure - rather than the top - to encourage bees to build down.

This is how they typically create their hives in the wild. 

The parts of the open-source hives are printed on a 3D printer and are shipped in flatpack boxes before being assembled.

All the sections then slot together, removing the need for potentially harmful screws and glue. 

The designs for the hives, called the Colorado Top Bar and the Barcelona Warre, are also downloadable and available from the project’s Indiegogo campaign.

This means anyone with their own 3D printer can produce their own range of hives at home.

‘These hives aim to prioritise bee colony health, make beekeeping more accessible and will ultimately allow you to log and study the health of your colony,’ said the designers.

The data sent to the Smartcitizen platform, plus the geolocation tags, are used to compare and analyse the hives to help prevent decreasing bee populations. Stock image of honeybees pictured

‘Your contribution will help us develop sensors to enhance our hives, connecting them to the Internet to log data about what is causing the bees to disappear around the world. 

‘This data can be used to study colony health, build hard evidence against the causes of the problem and generate policy change and informed solutions moving forward.’

The sensors that collect data can also be used to send warnings to a smartphone in the event of an emergency, or if something goes wrong.

For $100 (£60), Indiegogo investors receive a Mini-Hive kit sold with a miniature laser-cut beehive and the download kit. The download kit on its own costs $15 (£9).

The full-sized hives cost $300 (£180) without sensors, or $600 (£361) with the full Smartcitizen pack.

All packs are due to shipped this month.
