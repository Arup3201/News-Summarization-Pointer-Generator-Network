Finally safe: Pickles has been reunited with dog has been reunited with owners Harris Brunning, 14, and Eden Brunning, 12 after spending an incredible ten days trapped in an underground pipe

A lucky dog has been reunited with her owners after spending an incredible ten days trapped in an underground pipe.

Pickles, a seven-year-old terrier,  only escaped because she lost so much weight she could wriggle out back out of the pipe.

She disappeared into the 8cm-wide tunnel while being walked on farmland near her home in Market Harborough, Leics.

Firefighters and rescue experts were called in and used infra-red cameras and hi-tech audio equipment - normally used for finding earthquake survivors buried under rubble - to try to locate the beloved pet.

But after hours of digging and searching they  found no evidence that Pickles was still alive and were forced to call off the rescue - to the agony of owner Kirsty Brunning and her children Harris, 14, and 12-year-old Eden.

However, the plucky animal eventually managed to escape on her own, and was spotted by a passing motorist close to where she went missing.

He alerted the delighted family, who went to retrieve her.

It is thought she lost enough weight during her ten-day ordeal to be able to crawl through 300m (984ft) of pipe and finally wriggle free.

Ms Brunning, 42, said: 'It was awful when they said they was nothing else they could do.

'We’d read that dogs could survive for a long time underground, but we didn’t find anything.

'The kids were pretty upset and we had to explain to them that she may not come home and told them to be brave about it.'

Ms Brunning's son, Harris, said: 'The man who spotted Pickles came round and was shouting, ‘Get your shoes on, I’ve found her’.

'It was really amazing because we didn’t think she was coming home again - after 10 days I’d sort of given up.

'When I saw her again, I gave her a big hug - I was so happy.'

His sister, Eden, said: 'She’s like a
 miracle dog, she had a few scratches on her face and she looks like 
she’s been through the wars, but she’s back home now - safe and sound.'

Ms Brunning added: 'I was shocked, I couldn’t believe it.

'She
 was very thin and very dirty and the fur on her hips had rubbed off 
where she must have been trapped. She was very wobbly on her feet, too.'

Frantic search: RSPCA collection officer Sharon Knight near to the pipe Pickles climbed in to - she was dehydrated and is now on a high protein diet to build her weight back up - but is otherwise unharmed

'We all had tears in our eyes when we got her home, we were so happy to have her back.

'I honestly can’t believe it. After ten days we just thought there was no chance she would be alive. It is just amazing.'

Pickles was dehydrated and is now on a high protein diet to build her weight back up - but is otherwise unharmed.

Firefighter Andy Blyth, who was in charge of the rescue, said: 'It’s marvellous news, although ten days is a long time to be trapped.

'We usually hear of dogs being underground for two or three days - but this is amazing, I don’t know how she did it.'
