Carlos Tevez scored twice to help Juventus beat Hellas Verona 4-0 on Sunday and move five points clear at the top of Serie A.

Juventus had beaten Verona 6-1 in the Italian Cup on Thursday and  appeared to be on course to better that result when Paul Pogba and Tevez put the defending champions 2-0 up inside seven minutes.

However, Verona goalkeeper Rafael kept the tide at bay until shortly after the hour mark when Roberto Pereyra and Tevez completed the scoring.

Juventus knew they could reach the halfway point of the season with a significant advantage over second-placed Roma, who drew at Palermo on Saturday.

And it took less than two minutes to take the lead, with Pogba smashing a 25-yard thunderbolt into the bottom right corner from 25 yards.

Juventus had rested Tevez and Andrea Pirlo for the cup match and the former made his mark in the seventh minute. Pogba's dummy allowed Alvaro Morata's cross through and Tevez curled it in.

The home fans had to wait until the 66th minute to see Juventus extend the lead when Pereyra collected a fantastic through ball from Giorgio Chiellini and lifted it above Rafael.

Tevez completed the scoring with his 13th goal of the season.

Elsewhere in Italy, Gonzalo Higuain's first-half goal gave Napoli a 1-0 victory over Lazio at the Stadio Olimpico to secure his side's second victory in three league matches.

Victory for Rafael Benitez's side saw them leapfrog their opponents into third place in the Serie A standings.

In fourth, Sampdoria kept pace with a 2-0 win at bottom side Parma, thanks to strikes from Gonzalo Bergessio and Eder who ran the show at the Stadio Ennio Tardini.

Substitute Khouma Babacar scored a last-gasp winner as sixth-placed Fiorentina defeated Chievo 2-1 in Verona for their eighth win of the campaign.

It appeared Fiorentina would have to settle for a draw at the Marc' Antonio Bentegodi stadium after Sergio Pellissier's 72th-minute goal cancelled out Gonzalo Rodriguez's first-half opener, but Babacar had other ideas and headed home Joaquin's cross seconds from the end.

Atalanta upset the odds to beat AC Milan 1-0 at the San Siro for what was only their fourth win of the Serie A season to leave the hosts with just one win in 10 matches.

Both teams had come into the match struggling for form, but it was the visitors who battled hardest for the points and German Denis's first-half goal settled things in their favour to end a run of three successive league draws.

Cagliari left it late to claim a point from their trip to Udinese as they snatched a 2-2 draw.

Joao Pedro gave Gianfranco Zola's men the lead but two goals in as many minutes from Allan and Thomas Heurtaux gave Udinese the lead before Danilo Avelar scoried a penalty in stoppage time to earn Cagliari a point.
