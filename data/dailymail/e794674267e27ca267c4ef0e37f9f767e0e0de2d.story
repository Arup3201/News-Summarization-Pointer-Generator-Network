Manchester City striker Sergio Aguero is determined not to let standards slip as he bids to get the club's season back on track.

Aguero scored a sensational hat-trick against Bayern Munich on Tuesday to revive City's hopes in the Champions League.

The prolific Argentinian took his goal tally for the season to 17 as he followed up an early penalty by striking twice in the last five minutes to hand City a dramatic 3-2 win at the Etihad Stadium.

It was City's first win in the competition this season and gives them hope of reaching the last 16 with victory at Roma next month.

Aguero will also hope to maintain his form as the champions, who are eight points behind leaders Chelsea in the Barclays Premier League, travel to second-placed Southampton on Sunday.

Aguero said: 'It was important to win. Apart from my goals the three points were vital, so we're delighted. I am happy with my form. This season things are going well for me and it is important to carry on like this and keep the results coming.'

City were expected to take control against an already under-strength Bayern when Medhi Benatia was sent off for bringing down Aguero and the 26-year-old converted the resulting penalty.

But Bayern regrouped and the brilliant Xabi Alonso equalised from a free-kick before Robert Lewandowski got between two defenders to put the visitors ahead.

Time looked to be running out for City when Stevan Jovetic intercepted a rare bad pass from Alonso and Aguero burst clear to score five minutes from time. He pounced on another error in the last minute to snatch victory.

Aguero said: 'In the first half we got the first goal and we were doing more or less okay but then we lost two goals when we didn't expect it.

'In the second half we applied a bit more pressure and luckily we got the win. We've a chance now in Rome to qualify and it's a question of going there and winning and just thinking about ourselves.'

City are yet to find their stride this season and without the output of Aguero their position might be well below where they would expect to be.

Defender Bacary Sagna admitted the performances of Aguero were setting the standard for the rest of team.

Sagna said: 'He is bringing the team up at the moment. I think we will have to follow his steps. He showed the right example.

'He keeps fighting and in front of goal he is clinical. As long as he keeps scoring we can be happy.'
