It was one of his first-ever interviews - and it was with the British music sensation Totally Enormous Extinct Dinosaurs (TEED), at that. 

But for Ryan, a 30-year-old amateur interviewer for Byron Bay, his chat with the acclaimed U.K. electronic music producer at a Melbourne music festival at the weekend may have been his last. 

He said he felt ill when he realised he had left his notes behind which described the artist as 'f***ing boring to interview' and someone who 'just doesn't smile'.

And the DJ, real name Orlando Higginbottom, had posted the rude note to his social media accounts. 

'My night literally stopped dead in its tracks,' said Ryan, who did not want his last name published.

Whoops! Ryan (right) interviewed Orlando Higginbottom (left)... but left his notes behind. 

Awkward: The electronic music producer (pictured) shared the journalist's notes on his Facebook and Instagram pages. 

Very candid: The brief described him as 'f****** boring to interview' and someone who 'just doesn't smile'

The interview brief, given to Ryan by a superior at Blaire Magazine, said: 'Notes: He's English. Loves soccer and living a healthy lifestyle.

'He's f****** boring to interview (or the questions sucked), so you're going to have to be real creative with the questions and just have fun with this one.

'He doesn't give much eye contact at all, so don't be put off. He is listening.He just doesn't smile or something.'  

Despite the rude remarks, Higginbottom saw the amusing side of the situation.

He posted the notes on his Instagram page with the caption: 'One of the funniest things ever to happen to me on tour!! (Don't leave your interview notes behind kids) FYI it's all true.' 

On tour: The 28-year-old found the notes during his Australian tour. 

Ryan said the artist was a 'pretty nice guy'. But he admitted it was a challenging interview - and not just because he was nervous. 

'(There were) a couple of two word answers,' he said. 'He really didn't give too much away.'

'Everyone else was super talkative and wanted to see what I was up to. 

'It was kind of hard, and also because I've never really done anything like this.'

Despite the musician laughing off the incident, Higginbottom's social media fans were quick to come to his defence, taking aim at the questions he was to be asked.  

'"He's f****** boring to interview" they say as they proceed to come up with the most hideously boring questions known to man,' Chris Blondin Allen wrote. 

'Sounds like a teedious (sic) interview,' Matt Van Schie agreed. 

As for Ryan, he said: 'I'm just glad I'm not a proper journalist.' That would not have gone down as well.  

The boss: Despite the rude remarks, Higginbottom found the funny side of the situation and wrote 'it's all true'
