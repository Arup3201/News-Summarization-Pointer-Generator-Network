Amanda Knox's one-time boyfriend Raffaele Sollecito wishes he'd never laid eyes on the American brunette, he has admitted.

Six years after the murder of Knox's roommate, British exchange student Meredith Kercher, the Italian he says his life is hell because of his short-lived romance with Knox.

As he prepares to face trial for Kercher's 2007 murder in Perugia, Italy, for a second time, Sellecito said he doesn't blame her - but still wishes the two had never been together, so he could have been spared the ordeal. 

When CNN's Piers Morgan, left, asked Raffaele Sollecito whether he wishes he never met Amanda Knox, he replied 'Yes'

'My life is a hell, but it's not Amanda's fault, this situation,' Sollecito told CNN's Piers Morgan Tonight on Wednesday.

Instead, he said, he was falsely convicted the first time and must face trial against because of 'a prosecution that didn't want to admit its faults.'

Sollecito and Knox, who had met only seven days prior, scandalized the world when they were filmed by an Italian news crew kissing and embracing each other, hours after Kercher was brutally murdered.

Morgan asked the 29-year-old: 'Do you wish with hindsight that you'd never laid eyes on her, that you'd never become embroiled in such a lurid crime scandal as this has become?'

Sollecito responded: 'Yes... well basically, nobody would ever stay in a situation like mine.' 

Despite the admission, Sollecito doesn't harbor any ill will toward Knox. It has been reported that they met at a New York hotel in March after an Italian court overturned their acquittals. 

Both have since moved on, Knox has a 
boyfriend in her hometown of Seattle and Sollecito has posted pictures 
of himself with a new girlfriend, as well.

In October 2011, the two were freed after a court ruled that the two had been convicted based on faulty evidence.

Prosecutors said they now plan to introduce DNA evidence they say was found on a knife at Sollecito's apartment. 

Sollecito
 said the introduction of the blade was 'ridiculous' and said it had 
been contaminated by poor police handling - along with much of the other
 evidence.

He said he feels badly for Kercher's family, but that her murder should mean he and Amanda should have to suffer.

'What
 I really want is we don't need this tragedy moer victims. I'm just 
begging to look at the real facts and the truth,' he said.
