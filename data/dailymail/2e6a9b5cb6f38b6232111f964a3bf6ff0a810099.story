A gardener was able to take more than £200,000 from the bank account of an 89-year-old woman as a result of a ruling by the controversial Court of Protection.

The handyman persuaded the confused and vulnerable woman to sign an agreement that he should control all her bank accounts, savings and property.

The agreement – which was approved by the court even after social workers questioned the gardener’s motives – allowed him to put more than £200,000 of her money into his own account.

He was stopped only when he tried to take nearly £150,000 more of her savings, causing her insurance firm to raise the alarm and the police to investigate.

Astonishingly, although the court has now ruled the man can no longer manage the woman’s affairs, it has ruled that his name should be kept secret.

Details of the case were disclosed in a Court of Protection judgment under new legal rules demanding greater openness.

But critics said the ruling wrongly protects the gardener and leaves other elderly and vulnerable people and their families without warning of his record.

The extraordinary case will add to growing fears over the workings of the Court of Protection. Last week a damning inquiry found thousands of vulnerable people were being deprived of their liberty by decisions made in the secretive court under the Mental Capacity Act.

The scathing report by a Lords committee said that the Act was being ‘wilfully used to oppress individuals and to force decisions upon them’ and should be changed urgently.

The gardener, now 69, was able to persuade the wealthy widow to give him a lasting power of attorney (LPA) after he began working at her home in Orpington, Kent, in 2006.

The woman, who had spent her career working for the BBC World Service, has no children and only distant relatives.

In August 2011, she signed a will in which she promised to leave four-fifths of her estate to the gardener. Two months later, she signed over to him the right to control her affairs through an LPA.

Her signature was witnessed by her accountant, and two friends completed a form in which they said she understood what she was doing and was not being pressured into it, the Court of Protection found.

However, social worker Jenny Payne told the Office of the Public Guardian, which is part of the Court of Protection and regulates LPAs, that she had ‘concerns about [the gardener’s] conduct’.

She told the court that the woman had been found on a bus in a confused state and taken to hospital but that the gardener had turned up on the ward, declared there was nothing wrong with her and insisted that she be discharged into his care.

Despite this, the gardener was granted power of attorney. According to the judgment: ‘As the power of attorney was for property and financial affairs, and because the NHS concerns were of a personal and welfare nature, the Public Guardian felt that he was unable  to intervene.’

Six weeks after the gardener won power of attorney in February 2012, the widow was moved into a residential care home in Bromley with dementia. Over the following months, a series of payments were made to the gardener from her assets.

They included a banker’s draft for £7,000, cash withdrawals totalling £8,520 and a gift the gardener made to himself of £38,000.

A further £8,340 went on his salary for house clearance, rubbish removal and gardening. He paid a £599 deposit for a Motability car for his wife, together with £55-a-week car hire payments and petrol money of around £30 a week.

In February last year, he sold the widow’s house for £165,000 and moved the money into his own account. An investigation began only when the gardener asked Aviva to pay him the proceeds of a £140,000 investment bond held  by the widow.

A manager at the insurance company immediately froze the money and the Office of the Public Guardian started an investigation.

After he discovered he was being investigated, the gardener changed the name on the account into which he had put the money, putting it into the woman’s name.

Investigators for the Public Guardian found the woman did not even know who her gardener was and did not understand the powers she had given him. They also found he visited her care home only once every three weeks.

At a court hearing, the gardener protested that if the LPA were to be struck out, he would not be able to afford the Motability car and would no longer be able to take the woman to visit her husband’s grave.

But Senior Judge Denzil Lush ordered the LPA to be revoked. He said the gardener had broken its terms in several ways and his claim to a salary was ‘inherently artificial’.

Because there has been no criminal charge ‘it does not imply that his behaviour has been impeccable’, he said.

He ordered that the woman’s affairs should be managed by a publicly-appointed official who will pay her care home fees from the proceeds of the sale of her home.

Although the gardener was investigated by police, the Crown Prosecution Service decided not to prosecute. He will keep more than £60,000 of the money he took from the woman’s accounts and estate.

Liberal Democrat MP John Hemming, who has campaigned against secrecy in the courts, said: ‘This is not exactly naming and shaming.

‘It is clear that the secrecy here is acting to protect someone who has been trying to extort money from someone, and will do nothing to protect other elderly people in a similar situation.’

The Lasting Power of Attorney was introduced under the 2005 Mental Capacity Act, which set up the Court of Protection – only now being opened to public scrutiny after a series of scandals.

LPAs were designed to allow someone to hand control over their lives to a trusted spouse, friend or professional.

Whoever is named has the right to dictate the medical treatment of a vulnerable person, and is given the right to control financial affairs even before a person is deemed legally unable to make decisions for themselves.
