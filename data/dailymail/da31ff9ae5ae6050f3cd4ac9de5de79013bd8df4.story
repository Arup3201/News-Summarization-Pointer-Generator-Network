Admission: Richard Dumas pleaded guilty on Thursday to two charges of theft 

Former Phoenix Suns forward Richard Dumas has pleaded guilty to two counts of theft after being accused of stealing merchandise from a military base store.

Maricopa County, Arizona prosecutors say the 45-year-old  entered his plea Thursday. He's scheduled to be sentenced January 20.

Authorities say Dumas stole about $800 worth of merchandise from the Luke Air Force Base's exchange store while working with a janitorial service in 2012.

They say Dumas was seen on surveillance cameras taking cigarettes, alcohol, food, DVDs and shoes.

Dumas originally pleaded not guilty to eight felony charges of organized retail theft. Many of those charges were later dropped when he agreed to the plea deal. 

Dumas played for the Suns from 1992 to 1995 and helped the team reach the NBA Finals in 1993. He was waived by the team though after missing a drug test, and in 1998 he was arrested on cocaine charges. 

In the late 1990s, Dumas tried to resurrect his career by playing in Eastern Europe, but did not last long due to a knee injury.

After retiring from basketball in 2003, Dumas started a charity program to mentor young athletes. He was arrested last year while working at the Richard Dumas and Friends Athletic Organization headquarters.
