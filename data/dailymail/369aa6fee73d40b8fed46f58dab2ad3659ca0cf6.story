Gordon Brown launched a passionate and last-ditch attempt to save the faltering Union last night.

In a dramatic return to frontline politics, the former prime minister issued a timetable for Scottish ‘home rule’ in the event of a No vote in next week’s referendum.

His intervention came as another poll confirmed surging support for independence and the pound took a beating on the currency markets. Billions of pounds were also wiped off the value of Scottish-based firms in what experts warn is a taste of things to come if the 300-year-old United Kingdom is broken up.

Mr Brown said his cross-party package of measures giving Scotland greater control over spending, welfare and taxation could be in place by the end of next month and in operation by the end of January.

During a speech, the former Prime Minister spoke about plans for a timetable to give the Scottish Parliament more powers if voters reject independence next week

Impassioned: Former British Prime Minister Gordon Brown spoke at the Loanhead Miners Welfare and Social Club in Midlothian, Scotland

Mr Brown emphatically stated 'a No vote on September 18 will not be an end point but the starting gun for action' during today's rally at the Loanhead Miners’ Welfare in Midlothian

Trying to revive the lacklustre Better Together campaign, he said: ‘The future that is being decided is for ten, 20, 50, 100 years ahead.

‘We are making a decision that is irreversible. I’m thinking about the children of Scotland and future generations of children. It’s more important than one voting decision in an election.’

Amid growing panic in the No camp:

- Cabinet ministers warned privately that David Cameron’s future will be ‘very difficult’ if Scotland votes for independence next week;

- The Prime Minister told MPs that several Nato partners had used last week’s summit in Wales to raise concerns about the independence referendum;

- Nobel Prize winning economist Paul Krugman warned Scots that the ‘risks of going it alone are huge’;

- Prince William gave a hint of royal unease, urging people to focus on ‘big domestic news’ rather than the announcement that he and the Duchess of Cambridge are expecting a second child.

After a weekend poll showed the Yes camp moving ahead for the first time, another survey today confirms a late increase in support for independence. It is now backed by 41 per cent among those certain to vote, level with the No camp on 41 per cent.

The remaining 18 per cent who say they will definitely take part in the September 18 referendum are undecided, according to the TNS survey. 

This suggests the fate of the Union lies in the hands of 600,000 wavering voters. A year ago the No campaign was ahead by 22 points.

Yesterday, the pound fell by about 1.3 per cent against the US dollar to a ten-month low of $1.61 – and economists predicted a further, more dramatic slump in the event of the Scots voting to leave the UK.

British government debt was also shunned by international investors as separatists threatened to default on their share if they are not allowed to keep the pound.

The market value of RBS, Lloyds and Stagecoach, fell by more than a combined £2billion.

Michael Hewson, an analyst at CMC Markets, said: ‘Investors had dismissed the prospect of a Yes vote as an outlier, but recent opinion polls have shifted that perception and this has been no better demonstrated than by the plunge in sterling today.

‘One thing is certain, if we get this sort of volatility on the prospect of a Yes vote, can you imagine the reaction if we do get a Yes vote? It’s not likely to be pretty.’

Appearing at a rally in Midlothian last night, Mr Brown proposed that a cross-party agreement on further powers for Scotland should be reached by St Andrew’s Day and draft laws ready by Burns Night, on January 25 next year.

Labour leader Ed Miliband, who is facing mounting criticism over the collapse in support for the Union among Labour voters, immediately backed the intervention from his predecessor.

Speaking to the TUC in Liverpool, he promised that an incoming Labour government would ‘act immediately’ on further devolution.

Though Chancellor George Osborne trailed an announcement on a cross-party agreement on a devolution timetable at the weekend, there was surprise at Westminster that Mr Brown had made it.

Mr Cameron is not thought to have been consulted beforehand, but Downing Street last night welcomed Mr Brown’s proposals.

All three main Westminster parties have previously promised new powers for Scotland on tax and welfare in the event of a No vote, but differ on the details.

That inconsistency has been seized on by the nationalists who say the offers are a smokescreen.
