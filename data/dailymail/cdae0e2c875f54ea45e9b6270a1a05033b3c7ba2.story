Lorn Cheng appeared in Sydney Central Local Court on Tuesday

A grandmother who allegedly swallowed 252 pellets of heroin while attempting to smuggle the drugs into Australia has been granted bail.

Lorn Cheng, 50, was stopped by Australian Customs and Border Protective officers at Sydney Airport on January 8 after arriving on a flight from Cambodia.

Her bags were scanned by officers, and ephedrine and cocaine residue were detected.

A body scan was then carried out and images on it showed 'inconsistences', according to a statement from Australian Federal Police.

Cheng was taken into custody by the AFP when the woman was suspected of concealing drugs inside her body.

She was taken to hospital where she later passed a total of 252 pellets, which were tested and initial reports indicate the substance inside them was heroin.

Further testing will be carried to find out the exact weight and purity of the substance.

The pellets were about one centimetre wide and two centimetres in length.

They were wrapped in what appears to be in multi-coloured latex that balloons are made out of.

Cheng, from Cabramatta in Sydney's west, appeared before Sydney Central Local Court and was granted bail after being charged with importing a marketable quantity of a border controlled drug, 7News reported.

She was also ordered to surrender her passport to authorities.

The woman's daughter, Brenda, was only aware of her mother's whereabouts when she appeared before court, the Sydney Morning Herald reported.

The 22-year-old was so worried about her mother she went as far as filing a missing person's report at Cabramatta Police Station.

Brenda said the last time her mother had made contact was two weeks ago during her seven-week trip. 

'Every time she lands, she'll call me and I'll arrange to go pick her up to save money but I got no phone call on Thursday so we got really worried,' Brenda told Fairfax Media.

'I didn't know anything, this is such a huge shock, she has never done anything like this whatsoever.' 

ACBPS Regional Commander Tim Fitzgerald said this method of importation was particularly concerning.

She was detained by customs officers on January 8 after arriving on a flight from Cambodia, following a seven-week trip

'If you attempt to smuggle drugs internally, you are taking a serious gamble on your health and safety,' he said in a statement.

'The potential danger this woman has put herself in is a reminder of the risks involved with this kind of concealment. 

'It is also a reminder to the Australian public of the lengths that people and organised criminal groups will go to in order to import illicit drugs into our country.'

AFP Acting Airport Police Commander Conrad Jensen said drug couriers and their associates face strong penalties.

'This arrest should send a warning to criminals that if you participate in these activities, you could be facing up to 25 years imprisonment', he said.
