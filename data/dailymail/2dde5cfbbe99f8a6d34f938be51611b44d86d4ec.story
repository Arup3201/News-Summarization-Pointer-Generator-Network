It's that time of year when flies and wasps lurk around every corner, threatening to ruin your summer picnics and barbeques, not to mention leave you with a nasty sting.

Swatting with a rolled up newspaper is rarely effective, but fear not: A revolutionary device that takes out an annoying bug with a single shot is now available.

The Bug-A-Salt is an air-powered rifle that blasts a pinch of table salt at such high velocity that it is lethal to creepy-crawlies.

Watch out wasps! Makers claim Bug-A-Salt (pictured being refilled) has transformed 'bug-hunting' into a sport

Unlike fly swatters, which often leave smears of dead fly after they have been squashed, the only clean-up this device needs is a quick brush.

1. Lift the loader cap and pour in ordinary granulated table salt (holds about 50 shots).

2. Slide the cocking handle towards you and push away towards the barrel of gun. This action will activate the auto-safety and the pop-up sight will appear, indicating gun is ready to fire.

3. Release the auto-safety by clicking towards you.

4. Aim at target and fire.

The pump-action fly-killer has already been bought by almost 100,000 people in the US for $39.95, and the device is now available online in the UK, priced approximately £35.

The plastic shotgun requires no battery power or charging and instead uses compressed air to propel a pinch of table salt at the intended target, and holds enough salt for 50 shots before reloading.

The device is made by Skell Inc, a start-up company founded by Santa Monica, California artist Lorenzo Maggiore.

They say using ordinary table salt as opposed to dangerous chemicals and pesticides is a better way to dispose of critters.

The company is also apparently developing similar products in the near future.

Fly swatting just got serious: The shotgun uses compressed air to propel table salt at the intended target

The gun's ability to kill varies on its distance from 'prey' (diagram of its accuracy pictured, left). The Bug-A-Salt (pictured, right) should be used from a distance of three feet (90cm) and fires 50 shots before it needs refilling

A spokesperson for the company said: 'This is a completely safe way to take out an annoying bug.

'Because it uses ordinary granulated table salt, it would never break the skin on even the smallest child - although we do not recommend firing it at people.'

'If you’ve got half-decent aim, you can take out a fly from more than three feet away. It’s an extremely effective method of killing pesky mosquitoes and moths as well.'
