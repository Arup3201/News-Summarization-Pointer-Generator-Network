Quit: Chris Huhne, pictured outside Southwark Crown Court today, as he announced he would resign as an MP having pleaded guilty to perverting the course of justice

Chris Huhne has today quit as an MP after he pleaded guilty to making his then wife take his speeding points so he would not be prosecuted.

The former Energy Secretary had until this morning denied a single charge of perverting the course of justice, but now faces a likely jail sentence and the end of his political career.

'Having taken responsibility for something I did ten years ago, the only proper course of action for me is now to resign my Eastleigh seat in Parliament, which I will do very shortly', he said outside Southwark Crown Court.

Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg said he was 'shocked and saddened' by Huhne's conduct but had 'taken the right decision in resigning as an MP'.

The disgraced politician called his party leader last night to warn him that he would now plead guilty and leave parliament.

He faces between six and 12 months in prison, experts say.

Vicky Pryce, 60, still denies the offence on the grounds of marital coercion, using archaic legislation to avoid conviction claiming Mr Huhne, 58, forced her to act on his behalf.

Standing in the dock next to his ex-wife, Liberal Democrat Huhne asked to hear the charge against him again having denied it last week, but this time he replied 'guilty'.

He 'should be under no illusion' about the type of sentence he faces, the judge said after his change of plea.

Mr Justice Sweeney said: 'I'm going to grant you unconditional bail again.

'I will deal with your sentencing on a date to be notified.

'It is essential that you attend on that date and as Mr Kelsey-Fry has foreshadowed you should be under no illusion whatsoever as to the sort of sentence that you are likely to receive, understood?'

Mrs Pryce is still going to face trial, which will start at Southwark Crown Court tomorrow.

The couple separated after 26 years of marriage in 2010 after Mr Huhne admitted he was having an affair with his PR adviser Carina Trimingham, 46, who was in the public gallery.

Months later the extraordinary allegations emerged in two Sunday newspapers provoking a firestorm of controversy.

Huhne's departure from the Commons is the latest humiliation in a tumultuous fall from grace that began when allegations over the speeding penalty surfaced early in 2011.

He was only narrowly beaten by Mr Clegg for the party leadership in 2007, and was still regarded by many as the Deputy Prime Minister's natural successor.

Huhne received a severance payment of around £17,000 when he resigned from the Cabinet last February.

However, Downing Street insisted today it was a matter for him whether he returned the money.

Mr Huhne intends to voluntarily 
remove himself from the Privy Council after pleading guilty to 
perverting the course of justice, the Liberal Democrats said.

In the past disgraced ministers such as Jonathan Aitken and John Profumo have also voluntarily given up their membership.

Exit: Mr Huhne gets into a cab outside the court having admitted his guilt and his intention to resign as an MP with the judge warning he may face jail

Huhne's exit raises the prospect of a major coalition clash in the by-election for his Eastleigh seat.

Chris Huhne’s guilty plea follows 
months of legal wrangling in which the MP unsuccessfully tried to have 
the case thrown out, it can now be revealed.

The MP for Eastleigh, Hampshire, who
announced his resignation on the steps outside Southwark Crown Court 
following his dramatic admission, fought to get the charge dropped for 
almost 12 months.

His defence barrister John Kelsey-Fry QC had argued that the prosecution case was ‘gossamer thin’.

Mr Kelsey-Fry had tried the stay the
proceedings as an abuse of the court process of the court, claiming 
police investigations had not been ‘thorough, rigorous and 
conscientious’.

He also appealed to the judge to 
consider the difficulties Huhne faced due to the passage of time, lack 
of documents and negative publicity.

He said Huhne could ‘not sensibly’ 
be expected to remember the events of 2003 and that key documents 
‘demonstrative to the truth in a fundamental respect of this case’ were 
no longer available.

The barrister described media 
coverage in the wake of the allegations and in anticipation of a trial 
as having been ‘extreme, prolonged and across all media forms’.

Mr Justice Sweeney rejected the 
applications to dismiss the charges saying it was his judgement that 
‘there is a case to answer’.

The Lib Dem MP had a majority of 3,800 at the 2010 general election, but it is viewed as a key target seat for the Conservatives if they are to get an overall majority in 2015.

There is also the prospect of UK Independence Party (Ukip) leader Nigel Farage making another run for Parliament. He previously stood unsuccessfully in the seat.

Party sources said Ukip would be fielding a candidate in Eastleigh and Mr Farage would consider the situation, adding that the constituency was 'very close to his heart'.

The Labour party played down the prospect of making any progress in the Eastleigh, pointing out it is 258th on its list of target seats.

A source close to Ed Miliband said: ‘We recognise this is an uphill struggle but as a one-nation party we fight in every seat and campaign in every part of the country. We intend to campaign hard against both coalition parties."

58-year-old Huhne strongly denied the claims when he was charged by prosecutors last February, and repeated the denials in court as recently as last week.

Wearing a dark coat and green tie, the Liberal Democrat MP arrived arm in arm with his partner Carina Trimingham.

Mr Huhne, who gave his constituency address in Eastleigh, Hampshire, to the court, stood down from the Cabinet last year to fight the charge.

The events which led to the case date back to March 12, 2003 when Mr Huhne’s car was caught by a speed camera on the M11 near Stansted Airport.

He was accused of trying to cheat justice by stating that Mrs Pryce was at the wheel instead of himself when the offence took place.Mrs Pryce, a former Government economics advisor, accepted the fine and three points on her licence.

Mr Huhne is represented by John Kelsey-Fry QC, one of the country’s most sought after barristers whose clients have included Harry Redknapp and Steven Gerrard.

The multi-millionaire politician is the owner of an extensive property portfolio, including homes in London and Oxford.

Mother-of-five Mrs Pryce, of Clapham, south-west London, is represented by Julian Knowles QC, a member of the same chambers as Cherie Blair.

The trial, overseen by Mr Justice Sweeney, was expected to last up to two weeks.

Both defendants are on unconditional bail.

Chris Huhne is one of the most ruthlessly ambitious politicians in Westminster, even in a world where modesty is a taboo.

With multiple careers including journalist, economist, City high flyer, MEP, economist and cabinet minister, he considered himself infinitely better qualified for every job in Westminster.

He used to joke that he would not take a junior job at the Treasury because they have plenty of economists ‘and some are even better than me’.

Defiant until the end, even friends called him ‘rhino-hide Huhne’. But after two failed attempts, he hoped it would be third time lucky in his hopes of winning the Liberal Democrat leadership.

Instead his luck ran out, and his political career lies in tatters.
