X-ray images of an unopened cardboard box have revealed a treasure trove of Christmas tins sent to British soldiers on the Western Front 100 years ago.

A collector, who bought the unremarkable-looking box at auction on a hunch it may contain gift tins, didn't want to damage the box by opening it.

So instead, he decided to X-ray it - with the scans revealing hundreds of tins stuffed with goodies such as chocolate, cigarettes and sweets inside.

During the war, the tins were made in their thousands then shipped off by the Royals to soldiers fighting in the trenches over the first Christmas of the war in 1914.

Hidden treasures: 81 bronze tins stuffed with cigarettes, pencils and sweets that was due to be sent to the troops on the Western Front in 1914 have been found in a sealed cardboard box by a collector (pictured)

Gift: Thousands of tins, similar to this one pictured, were sent to troops in 1914. The five-inch boxes were paid for by the Sailors and Soldiers Christmas Fund - organised by George V's daughter Princess Mary

But one box never made it to its intended destination - and is now up for sale 100 years on for almost £30,000.

The five-inch long tins were paid for by the Sailors and Soldiers Christmas Fund - a nationwide appeal for donations organised by George V’s daughter Princess Mary.

It is thought that more than 355,000 were sent to troops in 1914, although due to the pressures put on the postal service some soldiers did not get theirs until 1916.

By the end of the war the fund had raised £200,000 and had sent out 2.5 million boxes.

Mystery surrounds the box for sale, which was bought by a collector of First World War memorabilia several years ago after he spotted it at auction.

The collector, who was told the box had been found in Ireland, suspected the box had Christmas tins inside so had it X-rayed as he didn't want to open it.

Hidden treats: The scan showed the box was stuffed to the brim with the Christmas gift tins, pictured, which contained a Christmas card, sweets and chocolate

It will be opened for the first time by Lady Emma Kitchener, great-grandniece of military great Lord Kitchener, at the Chalke Valley History Festival near Salisbury, Wiltshire, later this month.

A select amount of tins will be sold at the festival for £300 to £350 with the rest being auctioned in Onslows’ Great War sale in Dorset on July 9.

A proportion of the proceeds will be donated to a services charity.

Patrick Bogue, from Onslows auction house in Blandford, said: 'With Christmas 1914 approaching, George V’s daughter Princess Mary came up with the idea for a fund which would pay for presents for soldiers and sailors fighting on the front lines.

At the start of the conflict, British soldiers were allowed 10oz of meat and 8oz of vegetables per day. However, this was soon reduced as supply lines were disrupted due to naval and land blockades across Europe.

Two years later in 1916, the meat ration was down to 6oz a day. Towards the end of the conflict, soldiers were lucky to get meat once every nine days.

Some sources suggest the troops ate horse meat from animals killed on the front line.

Some soldiers reportedly grew their own vegetables in the trenches - but few were successful. Instead, nettles and weeds were used in stews.

Other goods provided included tea, bacon, cheese, jam and meat stews - all of which were tinned. Flour was scarce also, so ground-up vegetables were used as a substitute.

In terms of equipment, every soldier was issued with a 1908 Pattern Webbing for carrying personal items. It included: A wide belt, left and right ammunition pouches each stocked with 75 rounds and an entrenching tool head. A water bottle carrier, a small haversack - including a knife and unused rations - and large pack were also supplied.

A mess tin was contained inside a cloth buff-coloured khaki cover.

'She had wanted to do her bit and the campaign was very successful.

'It
 was common belief that the war was going to be very quick and so 
hundreds of thousands of these little tins with gifts inside were put 
together.

'It was meant to be a one off but as we know now the war lasted a lot longer than anticipated.

'The fund continued to grow and so the boxes were sent to others helping the war effort such as young soldiers and nurses.

'There were a few types of box - the initial ones contained a packet of cigarettes and a pencil made from a shell casing while others got sweets and chocolate.

'The box was found in Ireland but we don’t know any more about its history.

'It is a complete mystery as to whether this box was simply surplus to requirements or if there is another reason why it never made it to the front line.

'Its seal is still intact which would suggest it has never been opened which is incredible in itself because the tins potentially have packets of cigarettes in them.

'The box has been X-rayed and it confirms these are the tins with the shell cartridge pencils inside.

'It is amazing to think they have spent the last 100 years undisturbed.'

Chalke Valley History Festival runs from June 23 to 29. The box will be opened on June 28.
