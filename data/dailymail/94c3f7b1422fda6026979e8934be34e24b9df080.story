North Korea fired two more suspected short-range missiles into the sea this morning in another apparent protest against ongoing U.S.-South Korean military exercises that Pyongyang calls a preparation for attack, South Korean officials said.

The launches followed South Korea's announcement last week that North Korea fired four short-range Scud missiles with a range of more than 125 miles into the country's eastern waters.

North Korea routinely test-fires short-range missiles but has recently pushed for improved ties with South Korea and taken conciliatory gestures, including rare reunions of families divided by the Korean War last month.

Mystery: The North Korean projectiles were suspected to be Scud missiles but they could also be an upgraded version of its newly developed surface-to-ship KN-02 missiles or new types of artillery

The recent launches aren't expected to raise tensions in the region, as was the case last spring when the rival Koreas exchanged repeated threats of war following a third nuclear test by the North.

The two projectiles blasted from the North's east coast today flew about 310 miles before landing in the sea, South Korean Defense Ministry spokesman Kim Min-seok told reporters.

He said the launches were made without a prior notice, and described them as a provocation posing a serious threat to international aviation and maritime navigation and civilian safety.

'North Korea is doing an act of double standard by taking a peace offensive ostensibly, but later launching reckless provocative acts,' he added.

South Korea is trying to confirm what exactly North Korea fired based on the speed and trajectory of the projectiles, but an initial investigation showed they were suspected to be Scud-series missiles, a Defense Ministry official said, speaking on condition of anonymity in line with department rules.

Chang Yong Seok of the Institute for Peace and Unification Studies at the Seoul National University said that the launches appeared to be part of North Korean military training aimed at coping with the South Korea-U.S. drills.

He said that tensions could be heightened if North Korea tested a longer-range missile capable of hitting Japan or the U.S. territory of Guam.

Analysts say the North's recent charm offensive toward South Korea is largely aimed at helping lure foreign investment and aid to help revive the country's troubled economy.

The two Koreas are divided along the world's most heavily fortified border since the 1950-53 Korean War ended with an armistice, not a peace treaty.

About 28,500 American troops are deployed in South Korea, apparently as a deterrent against potential aggression from North Korea.

South Korea and the U.S. have said they have no intentions of invading North Korea and that their drills are defensive in nature.
