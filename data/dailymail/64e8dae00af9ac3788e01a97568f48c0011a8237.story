A British soldier has been jailed for four years in Cyprus for raping a British university student in the popular tourist resort of Ayia Napa last summer.

Private Sam Trussler, 25, showed little emotion as the criminal court in Larnaca passed sentence today.

Rape carries a maximum penalty of life imprisonment in Cyprus.

But the judge decided to show 'maximum leniency' after Trussler’s lawyer argued earlier this week that his client was 'a very successful soldier' who had served in Afghanistan and had no previous criminal record.

Dressed in black trousers and a white shirt, Trussler left the small courtroom flanked by policemen to begin his sentence 30 miles away in Cyprus’s only prison in the capital, Nicosia.

At the time of his crime Trussler was not stationed on the island but visiting on a training exercise with the 1st Battalion, the Royal Anglian Regiment.

Cyprus is home to two sprawling sovereign military British bases.

The name of his 22-year-old victim, who was on holiday in Ayia Napa, has not been released.

During his trial the court heard that he struck her in the face and then sexually assaulted her outside a block of hotel apartments on July 1 last year after walking her home from a nightclub.

He fled the scene when three women from the block ran outside to investigate after hearing the victim’s desperate screams.

A state pathologist and gynaecologist who examined the student said there was sufficient evidence to suggest she had been raped. DNA samples from Trussler were also found on her clothes.

He was arrested a day after the attack when his victim identified him in a police line-up.

His sentence includes the nine months he has spent in custody since then.

It is understood to be the most serious charge against a British soldier on the Mediterranean holiday island since 1994.

In September that year three off-duty squaddies stationed in Cyprus abducted and brutally killed a young Danish tour guide in Ayia Napa.

They were also convicted of conspiring to rape Louise Jensen, 23.

The trio received life sentences that were reduced to 25 years on appeal and were released a few years ago.

Nicosia central prisons – where Trussler has spent the last nine months – were built by the island’s former British colonial master at the end of the 19th Century.

His trial, which began in November, received little publicity in the local press.

Violent crime is rare in Cyprus.

After Louise Jensen’s killing nearly two decades ago, the British Army’s top brass on the island cracked down heavily on off-duty drinking and boorish behaviour.

As a result, British forces in Cyprus have not been plagued by bad publicity for many years.

The strategically-located military bases are unpopular with Greek Cypriots who see them as colonial footprints.

Trussler’s conviction means he will automatically be dishonorably discharged from the Army.

'We do not comment on individual cases,” said a British military spokesman said.

But 'all those who are found to fall short of the Army’s high standard or who are found to have committed an offence under the Armed Forces Act will be dealt with administratively, up to and including discharge”, he told The Mail.
