Police have launched an investigation after a four-year-old girl was found wandering the streets at 4.30am in her pyjamas.

The youngster was found by stunned factory worker Paul Collier as she wandered alone in Cleethorpes, Lincolnshire, clutching a soft toy.

Mr Collier, 58 - who called the police - said the little girl told him she was looking for a drink because her mother was asleep.

Concerned: Paul Collier (pictured) found the little girl wandering the streets in her pyjamas in Cleethorpes, Lincolnshire at 4.30am. He said several cars drove past the vulnerable youngster without stopping

Mr Collier said: 'I couldn’t believe it, where were her parents and how did she get out of the house?'

'It was ridiculous, it could have been anyone who picked her up.

'This little girl was so trusting I think she would have got in anyone’s car.

'I was in absolute shock more than anything else - it just felt like a dream.'

Police returned the girl to her mother and are now working with North East Lincolnshire social services to find out how she came to be on the streets.

Found: The girl has now be returned to her mother in the seaside town (pictured on the map above)

A Humberside Police spokesman said: 'The child was, after a short time, returned to her home address and mother’s safety.

'Officers are now working with social services to establish the circumstances of the incident.'

Mr Collier added: 'My wife was livid when I told her.

'She couldn’t believe a child so young would be able to get out and walk the streets alone.

'I couldn’t stop thinking about it all day afterwards, all the ‘what-ifs’.

'Imagine if I hadn’t stopped and then I heard a child had gone missing.'

Mr Collier said he could not have forgiven himself if he had ignored the child.

'There were a lot of cars on the road that didn’t stop,' he said.

'She
was such a chatty, jolly, little girl which made me think she might not
have been taught not to talk to strangers.

'That’s what scared me the
most.

'I am just glad it was me who stopped and no one else.'

A
council spokesperson confirmed: 'We are aware of an incident concerning
a small child and can report an investigation into the matter is 
underway.'
