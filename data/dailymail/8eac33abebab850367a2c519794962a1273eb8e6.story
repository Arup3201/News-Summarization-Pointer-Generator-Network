A major row has broken out at the BBC over the extra audio content being made available on an ad-hoc basis for some World Cup matches on their digital red button.

One of the offerings is a ‘puerile’ Radio 1 feed from Scott Mills and co-host Chris Stark which has greatly annoyed members of the BBC Sport team in Brazil, who are intent on covering the tournament professionally.

The pair’s contribution during the Brazil v Mexico game was called by one insider: ‘The most puerile, childish, pathetic stuff that you could wish to hear. There are 11million watching the game and we’re directing viewers to listen to utter garbage.’

Controversy: BBC DJ Scott Mills (pictured) and co-host Chris Stark have been criticised by fellow staff for their 'childish' World Cup coverage

On top of that, BBC Sport bosses seem unclear what control they have over red button content with the cringeworthy Radio 1 option appearing higher in the drop-down list than the proper  5 Live commentary.

A BBC spokesman said: ‘We are offering the best service we can on all platforms and the Radio 1 audio is for a Radio 1 audience. The guys loved doing it and we may use them again.’

The spokesman was unaware who decides when the Radio 1 feed is used.

Richard Keys and Andy Gray, the Sky Sports rejects, claim in their risible World Cup diary that your Sports Agenda columnist doesn’t exist.

All I have to say in response is that the nearest those two forgotten dinosaurs have got to the football in Brazil, following the Sky sexism scandal, is that home of diversity and equality Qatar.

David Gill, the English football administrator most likely to achieve high office in Nyon or Zurich, is undecided whether to stand as the England representative for election to the FIFA vice-presidency being vacated by Northern Ireland’s Jim Boyce in 2015.

Gill has major reservations about any involvement with FIFA while Sepp Blatter is at the helm. The full UEFA electorate will have a vote on the British place for the first time with Scotland (Campbell Ogilvie) and Wales (Trefor Lloyd Hughes) also putting up candidates.

FA party swells to 90

Sportsmail listed the 77 personnel in the official FA World Cup party when they flew out for the training week in Miami, but the real total is considerably more.

The England-related group also includes a five-strong team from Mischief PR assisting the FA on community projects, two extra Nike employees, more FA commercial bodies, two added security figures assigned to the hotel and training ground and England Under 20 coach Aidy Boothroyd on a study group.

It is no wonder Budweiser dumped their £9m-a-year FA Cup sponsorship, such is their extraordinary World Cup spend.

The lager brand have booked the entire 247-room Prestana Hotel on Copacabana beach for a month and are lavishly entertaining guests from 40 countries at a seven-figure cost.

The protest group of Falklands War veterans angered by an offensive tweet from talksport lead pundit Stan Collymore called off Wednesday’s clear-the-air meeting with radio chiefs and will carry on with a demonstration outside the station’s London headquarters on Satuday.

This follows talksport insisting only reformed hooligan Dougie Brimson attended the summit, when the anti-Collymore campaigners wanted their lawyers present.

The England team will eventually parade in their anthem jackets ahead of kick-off against Uruguay after dispensing with the extra layer in Miami and Manaus because of the heat, much to Nike’s angst.

The England players are cooled down by spray following their pre-match routine and the legion of sports scientists in Roy Hodgson’s staff did not want them to risk warming up again in the achingly commercial swoosh jackets.
