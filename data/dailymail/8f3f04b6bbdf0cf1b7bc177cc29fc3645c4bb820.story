Accused: Michelle Smith White, 37,  tattooed the name of a 16-year-old student on her body

A North Carolina high school teacher has been charged with having sex with a 16-year-old female student after she was caught with a tattoo of teenager's name.

Michelle Smith White, 37, had the student’s name and initials tattooed on her body after ‘engaging in a sex offense’ with the 16-year-old, court documents claim.

White met the alleged victim while working as a dance teacher at a local high school in Durham, North Carolina, in 2012, when the girl was just 15 years old,  and the friendship later evolved into a sexual one.

White worked at Charles E. Jordan High School, where the alleged victim was a student, from 1997 until April 2014.

Upon leaving the school, White was asked by the teen’s parents to stop communicating with their daughter, but the pair were caught exchanging sexually charged text messages in May, WRAL-TV reports.

The texts included the word ‘threesome’ and ‘alluded to the involvement of Ms White's husband,’ according to an affidavit by the Durham County Sheriff's Office.

The affidavit backs an application for a warrant to search White's home, computers and phones.

White has also been ordered to show a tattoo which depicts an ‘artist rendering which would be symbolic of the juvenile’ as well as the teen’s name and initials, to be used as evidence.

Police have also asked to seize several framed photos of White with the alleged victim, a handwritten card, and a binder filled with notes from White's husband to the teenager.

White has been charged with taking indecent liberties with a student and engaging in a sex offense with a student.
