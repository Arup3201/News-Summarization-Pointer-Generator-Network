Thousands took to Twitter after rumours spread that the Transcendence actor was in the centre of Leek and had popped into the town's Foxlowe Arts Centre for refreshment.

Fans flocked to try to get a glimpse at the A-list actor - believed to be filming with Tobey Maguire in the area - with many waiting hours outside hotels where he was rumoured to be staying. 

The Sleepy Hollow star, who is engaged to actress Amber Heard, took a breather at  Foxlowe Arts Centre, where he is reported to have enjoyed a cup of coffee and a slice of cake.

Manager Ian Wilson, 52, said: 'He came in for a coffee and a slice of cake. It was all round town and over social media. My telephone was red hot. I had to turn it off after a while.

'He was here with his agent and a couple of others. There was no fuss, no grand-standing or anything like that. Everyone behaved pretty normally around him.'

The chair Depp allegedly sat on whilst dining on his snack has caused such a fuss that Mr Wilson has decided to remove it from the cafe.

Mr Wilson added: 'I didn't meet him myself, but our staff and volunteers have said that he said he liked the place and what we are doing here.'

The father-of-two, who split with long-term partner Vanessa Paradis last year and is now engaged to The Rum Diary co-star Amber Heard, is currently in the UK to film Through The Looking Glass.

The sequel to the the 2010 adaptation of Alice In Wonderland, Depp stars as the Mad Hatter alongside Helena Bonham Carter, Sacha Baron Cohen and Anne Hathaway.

The film is scheduled for release in 2016.
