A former banana importer who was involved in a fatal drug-fueled threesome has been sentenced to up to four years in prison after beating his girlfriend of six months to a pulp at their New York home.

Thomas Hoey Jr, 46, the wealthy owner of now-bankrupt Long Island Banana Corp, 'brutally attacked' Alison Bretherick, 29, at their Manhattan apartment in 2012, then tried to conceal the evidence.

After the 'vicious' assault, Miss Bretherick was left bleeding from the scalp, unable to hear in one ear and with a red and swollen face. She also suffered several chipped teeth, court documents state.

Despite her injuries, the victim defended her millionaire boyfriend in court, pleading with Judge Daniel Fitzgerald for mercy on his behalf. 'I miss him every day,' she said in an emotion-choked voice.

However, apparently unmoved, Judge Fitzgerald handed down the maximum sentence to Hoey - who had previously been convicted  of third-degree assault and tampering with evidence - on Friday.

He sentenced the defendant to up to four years in prison, and also extended an order of protection aimed at keeping him away from Miss Bretherick for five years, the New York Daily News reported. 

The sentencing comes just a month before Hoey is due to be sentenced in a pending federal court matter for giving cocaine to a woman, who later died, during a three-way hotel sex romp in 2009.

In the latter case, Hoey faces up to 11 years for conspiracy to distribute cocaine, conspiracy to suborn perjury and obstruction of justice relating to the incident at Manhattan's ritzy Kitano Hotel.

He allegedly delayed a call for help when 41-year-old mother-of-two Kimberly Calo collapsed on the floor and started frothing at the mouth after overdosing on cocaine at the $700-a-night venue..

Hoey, who was dubbed the 'Banana King' by the media after Miss Calo's death hit the headlines in 2012,  admitted to providing the high-quality cocaine to the personal trainer during the romp.

He has also been accused of pressuring the other participant in the threesome, Nicole Zobkiw, his then girlfriend, to lie in court. Miss Zobkiw has since died of a suspected cocaine overdose.

In Friday's beating case, Hoey entered the courtroom in handcuffs, winking at Miss Bretherick before she made a plea for mercy on his behalf to Judge Fitzgerald, denying that he had assaulted her.

'My life and city was taken from me along with my happiness of living with my boyfriend,' Miss Bretherick, a former University of Pennsylvania swimmer, told the court in a tearful voice.

She added that the court process has left her 'abused, disregarded and disrespected - none of which Tom makes me feel.' Hoey then told the judge: 'I love Alison and I would never hurt her.'

But sentencing Hoey, Judge Fitzgerald said he had shown no remorse, saying: 'The assault was vicious. There was blood and at the time, the defendant lied to the police about how it happened.'

He added: 'Moreover, I believe he influenced Miss Bretherick to lie to them also.' 

Miss Bretherick had only been with Hoey for six months when she was subjected to the assault.

Court documents state a neighbor called 911 after hearing cries on March 30, 2012. Before police arrived, Hoey tried to clean up blood leading from an apartment door to a stairwell.

During an interview with police, Hoey reportedly told officers, who saw his girlfriend's red and swollen face on the day of the attack, that the blood had come from him picking his nose.

At Friday's sentencing, Assistant District Attorney Laura Millendorf said there was undeniable physical evidence that Miss Bretherick had suffered facial and head injuries during the beating.

'The back of her head laceration was bloody, fresh and deep when they arrived,' Ms Millendorf said. 

'It was so deep, in spite of the fact that she showered and was attempting to hide the laceration, they could see it from across the room.'

She added: 'This assault was brutal and his attempts to cover up this crime are equally as serious.'

Hoey was previously alleged to have beaten Miss Bretherick so often and so viciously that she once scribbled on the back of a photograph, 'If you find me dead, Thomas hoey did it'.

Under the limited protection order, Miss Bretherik is able to contact and visit Hoey behind bars.
