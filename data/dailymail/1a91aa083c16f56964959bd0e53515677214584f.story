On any given night at Arsenal's Hale End academy, Brooklyn Beckham may find himself under the watchful eye of ex-England midfielder Dennis Wise.

Like Brooklyn, Wise's son, Henry, is one of the young hopefuls enrolled at the Gunners' Walthamstow complex. Some evenings he may even find himself being put through his paces by Thierry Henry, who is taking regular sessions with the club's academy as he completes his coaching badges.

And then, of course, there's dad David, a regular at Hale End as he keeps tabs on the fledgling careers of his eldest son — as well as Romeo and Cruz, who are also on Arsenal's books. No pressure then, Brooklyn.

The teenager has caused quite a stir at Arsenal's youth HQ over the past few months.

At the age of 15, he was named on the bench for last weekend's Under-18 clash against Leicester, raising hopes that he may well have the substance to back up his name.

Brooklyn will discover over the weekend whether his call-up was indicative of a burgeoning career, or merely a generous farewell gesture, with the teenager due to be told whether he is to be retained for next season or released.

Brooklyn's rise through the age groups — having started in the U15s — at Hale End this season has not gone unnoticed by those who are tasked with guiding his career. It seems he is modelling his game on David's, too. The descriptions of his playing style are uncanny.

He plays on the right, but has a tendency to drift into central positions; he is economical on the ball, makes good runs into the box and isn't afraid to have a shot. And to top it all off…he is pretty accurate with a dead ball, too.

Sound familiar?

He isn't the strongest, though. His 15-year-old frame is still slight and there's a feeling he needs to toughen and bulk up, a problem many young players have. It is also said that he could work harder on his defensive duties during matches.

Whether Brooklyn is given another year at Arsenal remains to be seen — but what's for sure is Beckham Snr will be there to celebrate or commiserate with his son.

David has been the driving force — literally — behind Brooklyn's career so far. Schedule permitting, David will invariably drive his sons to Hale End for their evening training sessions and Saturday matches. If he is unavailable, then grandfather Ted will step in.

David — like all parents — is sent regular email updates with scheduling details for training, matches and meeting times. The emails also provide details of regular 10-minute meetings parents are required to attend to discuss players' progress. David ensures he regularly attends.

By all accounts, there are no airs or graces about the Beckham clan when they're at Hale End.

One source said: 'Brooklyn is a down-to-earth kid, the other parents like him, too. He is a credit to the family. You wouldn't know he was David Beckham's son.'

David insists on it. He knows the value of the English youth system and wants Brooklyn to have the same football upbringing he had.

There seems a good chance that at least one of the Beckham brothers will continue the family's football legacy.

Romeo, 12, has earned rave reviews playing for Arsenal's U13s, and scored, in front of his dad, in a 3-2 win over Liverpool in a youth tournament on Thursday.

But speak to those in the know at Hale End and youngest son Cruz, 10, has the potential to be the best Beckham brother.
