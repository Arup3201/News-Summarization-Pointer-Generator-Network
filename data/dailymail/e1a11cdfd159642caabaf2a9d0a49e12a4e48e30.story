Listeners to Radio 4's Today programme
 were given an unmistakable but totally bogus message last week: that 
catastrophic storms such as Typhoon Haiyan are linked to global warming –
 and are set to increase.

The
 same claim, which has no scientific basis, was echoed by David Cameron,
 who said there was 'growing evidence' that warming was responsible for 
storms.

Interviewing Jim 
Yong Kim, president of the World Bank, presenter Evan Davis announced 
that climate change has made the Philippine islands 'one of the most 
fragile parts of the planet' and asked what would the world do if more 
frequent storms forced its population to abandon them.

Radio 4 Today programme presenter Evan Davis said announced that climate change has made the Philippine islands 'one of the most fragile parts of the planet'

'That's a great question,' Kim 
replied. In his view, rising seas caused by global warming would make 
not just islands but the Thai capital Bangkok uninhabitable 'within the 
next 20 to 30 years'.

'The 
predictions the scientists  are making are that the severity and 
frequency of these extreme weather events are going to go  up,' he said.

The
 response of Davis – with the full weight and authority of the BBC's 
morning news flagship behind him – was to muse: 'If we don't invest in 
the prevention of climate change, we'd better invest in border control.'

In fact, basic facts Davis and the 
Today programme's army of researchers failed – or refused – to raise 
with Jim Yong Kim include:

Climate change? Countries all over the world have pledged relief aid to help support those affected by the typhoon

Meanwhile, Japan last week joined Australia in renouncing  its target for cutting greenhouse gas emissions.

Dr
 Benny Peiser, director of  the Global Warming Policy Foundation, said 
both Mr Cameron and Today seemed 'totally unaware of both the science 
and changing international realities. Every scientist is adamant that 
the typhoon has nothing to do with global warming.'

A
 study based on data from the Joint Typhoon Warning Centre and the Japan
 Meteorological Agency shows the number of typhoons making landfall in 
the Philippines has declined since 1990.

The
 UN Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change – hailed by greens as the 
ultimate arbiter – does not agree tropical storms have become more 
intense or frequent, but says the opposite. Their special report last 
year said: 'There is low confidence in any observed long-term (40 years 
or more) increases in tropical cyclone activity (ie intensity, 
frequency, duration).'  Its authoritative Fifth Assessment Report added 
in September there have been 'no significant observed trends in global 
tropical cyclone frequency over the past century'.

The
 reason Bangkok is suffering serious floods isn't rising sea  levels but
 the fact the city is built on soft clay – the weight of its skyscrapers
 is causing subsidence of up to 2in a year. Local expert Anond Snidvongs
 says: 'The rise in sea level is not that great and climate change only 
plays a fairly small part – about one-fifth – in the current scenario.'

There
 have been very few Category 5 storms like Haiyan in the Pacific since 
1991. A study published this year by the American Meteorological Society
 states in the North Pacific 'overall tropical cyclone activity shows a 
significant decrease' since 1998.

This
 year has been the quietest Atlantic hurricane season for decades. No 
Category 3 or stronger storm has made landfall in the US since Katrina 
in 2005 – the longest hurricane 'drought' on record.

A
 new study published last week said the rate of sea level rise has 
diminished by 44 per cent since 2004, to just 1.8mm per year – 18cm 
(7in) per century. The reason is the 17-years-and-counting global 
warming 'pause', which was not predicted by computer models.
