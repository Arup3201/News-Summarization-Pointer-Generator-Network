An amateur mixed martial arts fighter at a Spokane event on Friday attempted a spectacular maneuver: an off-the-cage roundhouse kick aimed right at his unwitting opponent's face.

It failed spectacularly. Instead of landing his kick, the ill-fated go-getter wound up landing face first in the middle of the ring.

That left him wide open for his opponent to leap in and pummel him, which the opponent did.

The amateur brawler was likely attempting to replicate professional UFC fighter Anthony Pettis's signature Showtime kick.

Pettis, a UFC championship titleholder, got his nickname Showtime from the move. It also helped him become the UFC lightweight champion, as well as a fan favorite.

As the Deadspin writer who first pointed out the failed attempt says, it's 'a spectacular reminder that we must dare to dream.' 

Spectacular move: An amateur MMA fighter (right) near Spokane attempted a spectacular move during a cage match on Friday

Off the cage: The fighter was trying to catapult himself off the cage and propel a flying kick toward his opponent, who can be seen just behind the pole at center

Fail: The fighter succeeded in propelling himself...right into the mat, where his opponent pounced

Oops: All the amateur fighter succeeded in doing was take a beating for his poor decision making

How it's supposed to look: Here, pro UFC fighter Anthony Pettis uses his signature Showtime kick

The kick has earned Pettis the nickname Showtime and helped him become the UFC lightweight champ as well as a fan favorite
