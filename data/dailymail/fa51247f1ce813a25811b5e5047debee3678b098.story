A labourer has dubbed himself The Human Cannonball after he broke his back bouncing off a trampoline - but carried on playing football and breakdancing for eight days.

Jordan Adlard, 26, was drunk at his cousin's barbecue when he jumped 20ft from an oak branch onto the outdoor toy, which catapulted him sideways into a fence.

But Mr Adlard, from Helston, Cornwall, continued his everyday life with a sore back for more than a week before doctors discovered a compression fracture in his spine.

Where it went wrong: The labourer makes contact with the trampoline before bouncing violently into the air

Ouch: The friend looks on as he hits the fence with a crunch before falling with his back to the wooden boards

Medics who X-rayed him at the Royal Cornwall Hospital told Mr Adlard, who played football the day after the accident, that he could have suffered serious harm had he waited any longer.

Mr Adlard said: 'I was eyeing up the jump at the barbecue and the more I drank the more I wanted to do it.

'Live and learn': Mr Adlard said he was unlikely to try the same trick again

'Lots of the kids were doing front flips and I wanted to better them, so I decided to climb up the tree to jump off.

'I was tipsy but it was quite painful. I was on the ground for two or three minutes - I nearly cried which I haven’t done for years.

'When I hit the floor everyone went quiet and stopped laughing.

'They wanted to make sure I was all right, but I managed to get up and continue drinking and enjoying the barbecue.

'I didn’t think it was broken as I was able to get up and move around.

'I even did some breakdancing later on.'

The stunt was filmed by his girlfriend Nyssa Smith, 25, last Sunday and captured guests cheering and screaming as Mr Adlard made the jump.

The labourer, who expects to be unable to work or play sport for 10 weeks, said: 'I didn’t think nothing of it at first as I thought if I had broken anything I wouldn’t be able to walk.

'But after eight days I decided to go to the hospital as I was still in pain.

'They didn’t pick anything up on the X-ray at first but I got a call the next morning saying that I had a compression fracture of my back.'

He added: 'It was a stupid thing to do - but you live and learn. You’d have to pay me a lot of money to do it again.'

Pain: Despite saying he almost wanted to cry from the pain, Mr Adlard did not visit the hospital for eight days
