An autopsy carried out on the body of a missing Oregon mother of two found dead on Tuesday morning has listed her cause of death as suicide.

Jennifer Huston’s body was found near her SUV on a rural, remote road about 24 miles from her Dundee home.

The Oregon State Medical Examiner’s Office listed her cause of death as asphyxiation on Wednesday, although toxicology results are still not available.

An autopsy carried out on the body of Jennifer Huston, the missing Oregon mother of two who was found dead on Tuesday morning, has listed her cause of death as suicide

Inside the vehicle, detectives found a note addressed to members of Huston’s family. Her purse and personal items, which included her cell phone, were also located in the vehicle.

The cell phone was detectives who found no indications of nefarious actives, reports KOIN.

‘Our hearts ache today. We have lost our
 first born child. We have lost a wife and a mother. We don’t know what 
lead Jennifer to this dark place and to this end and perhaps never will 
understand this,’ said the Huston family in a statement.

The 38-year-old had last been seen taking cash out at a bank, filling up her car with gas and 
then buying snacks and non-lethal sleeping pills at a Rite Aid in nearby
 Newberg around 6.22pm on July 24.

Mr Huston has said that his wife complained of headaches three days before disappearing, but she hadn't seen a doctor. At a press conference on Monday, he said he feared she'd crashed her car

Detectives also found the empty box of 
the sleeping aids that she had purchased at the Rite Aid pharmacy and a 
gas receipt from the Circle K gas station in Newberg.

Based
 on the evidence, detectives and the medical examiner 
said they concluded that Huston had died fairly close to the time she was 
reported missing.

Her cell phone stopped working minutes after she was seen at the gas station, but police said it was not due to a dead battery, according to Fox News, and she has not used her credit cards since.

She told her husband, Kallen Huston, she had some errands to run, but then never returned home.

At a press conference this week, Mr Huston said he believed that finding his wife's 99 Lexus would be the key to finding her. He also pleaded directly with his wife for her safe return.

'Jennifer, if you could see this or hear this, I love you,' Mr Huston said.

'You have a ton of support from the community. If you can come home, please do. The boys need you. I need you. I love you.

He added: 'We'll never stop looking for you.'

Local police called off their search on Friday with one final aerial search across rural roads in the area.

They also visited the San Juan Islands where the family used to visit but made no progress.

'After
 [Friday's] flight, the Yamhill County Sheriff's Office will have 
covered all rural areas of Yamhill County and no further search efforts 
are planned for Yamhill County,' a spokesperson for the sheriff's office
 said.

'If additional information arises, search efforts will be resumed as necessary.'

A clearly emotional Mr Huston, flanked by fellow members of her family, said he keeps calling his wife's cell phone even though it's been turned off on the hope someone might finally answer.

Last seen: Police released these surveillance footage 
stills of Mrs Huston's car at a gas station just minutes before she vanished last Thursday. Her cell phone stopped working shortly after

As to questions surrounding her final 
known purchases, a Gatorade, trail mix, and sleeping aids, her husband 
said they were not a cause for alarm - the sports drink was because it 
was a hot day, the trail mix was something they had in the house often, 
and the pills could be attributed to a headache she'd been suffering 
from for three days.

He went on to call the disappearance 'completely out of character for her. She loves me, She loves the boys.'

Captain
 Jeff Kosmicki of the Newberg-Dundee Police Department said her car, a 
1999 dark green Lexus LX 470 SUV, would be able to travel 300 to 350 
miles after she filled up the tank.

Mrs Huston was a stay-at-home mother 
to her two sons, aged two and six.

Her husband previously said he'd told
 them she was on vacation because he couldn't bear to tell them the 
truth.

He also expressed
 his fears that she might be 'in a ditch somewhere' after driving her 
car off the road and urged motorists to look out for his wife.

'I ask that anybody helping us, 
regardless of the area they are in, look off to the left and off to the 
side of the highways,' he said.

'This is totally unlike her. She's a 
devoted mother. She’s just a very good person, and for her to do 
something like this is completely out of the norm.'
