Anti-gay hackers have reportedly shut down more than 70,000 accounts on a Russian gay dating app and threatened its users with arrest.

The founder of Hunters - which resembles the global hook-up app Grindr - claimed vigilantes brought the service to its knees just days before Olympic dignitaries arrived in Sochi.

He said 72,000 profiles were deleted and users received a message saying: 'Warning: You will be arrested and jailed for gay propaganda in Sochi according to Russian Federal Law 135 Sektion 6.'

Hunters become hunted: Users of the Russian equivalent of Grindr received these threatening messages

Russia has faced global pressure over its law banning gay 'propaganda', which makes it illegal to tell children homosexuality is acceptable, and a surge of vigilante attacks that have accompanied it.

Groups with names like Occupy Paedophilia hunt down gay men, abduct them, film themselves torturing them and post the footage on YouTube, with campaigners saying police are unwilling to act.

The founder of the app - whose advertising claims its users have sex every seven seconds - sent veteran gay culture journalist Andy Towle evidence of the mass attack.

The threatening message was sent at 11.52pm on February 1, he said - then the next morning, users trying to open the app in Sochi and the nearby district of Adler found themselves locked out.

They were faced with a message saying they had entered the wrong password and would be blocked for 55,260 minutes - or 38 days. 

Account locked: More apparent screenshots from the app, provided to MailOnline by its anonymous founder

The app's founder, who asked his full name to be kept anonymous, told MailOnline: 'The app came under an attack by hackers, resulting in users from Sochi receiving threats of arrest and their profiles being blocked. Several hours later some 72,000 user profiles were deleted in Russia.

'I'm sure that this provocation against the gay community was initiated by the Russian authorities and was an attempt to eliminate any gay interaction during the Olympic Games in Sochi, including any between athletes, tourists and locals.

'The hackers didn't leave any traces, but it is clear from an obvious spelling mistake that they were not native English speakers. I'm sure that the attackers were acting in the interest of Russian authorities.

'I urge the entire gay community and all of those who consider the Internet to be a free zone to boycott not only Russian vodka but also everything that is linked to the Olympics and not to buy any Olympic souvenirs.'

The app claims to have more than a million users worldwide, 100,000 of whom are in Russia.

Popular: The Hunters website claims one of its users has sex every 20 seconds - but more than 70,000 profiles were shut down and users were sent threatening messages. The servers are being moved out of Russia

Hook-ups: The app bears close similarities to the U.S.-based gay hook-up app Grindr (file photos)

Engineers managed to restore about a quarter of the deleted profiles, but the rest were lost permanently, he claimed.

The firm reacted by immediately moving its servers from Russia to elsewhere in Europe.

The app, similarly to Grindr, gives users a 'grid' of other members who are nearby, listing them in the order of their proximity.

Grindr chiefs have insisted the service is not just for sex, preferring to describe it as a 'location-based social networking application'.

Friday's Winter Olympics opening ceremony featured a performance by 'faux-lesbian' singers tATu, who sang a song about love between two teenage girls - despite gay rights protesters being arrested hours later.

Russian authorities said the duo were chosen because they were one of the few Russian pop acts known worldwide.

Gay rights have been top of the agenda in Sochi, with Barack Obama not attending the ceremony and sending a delegation which included openly gay athletes instead.

Swamped: Andrey Tanichev (centre), who owns Sochi's only gay club Mayak, has given 200 interviews

Such is the attention that Sochi's only gay club has been beset by journalists trying to get a taste of the underbelly of Russian gay culture.

According to New Republic, the catchphrase among those posted to cover the Olympics is 'Have you been to Mayak yet?'.

Club owner Andrey Tanichev said he has given more than 200 interviews to reporters from almost every country in the world - 'except the Spanish, God bless them'.

Rejected: Music festival organisers were left hanging on the telephone for Eighties legends Blondie

Eighties pop-rock icons Blondie refused the offer of a gig at the Sochi Olympics because of Russia's record on gay rights.

Singer Debbie Harry posted a photo of the original offer on Twitter (right) with the words 'PASS, HUMAN RIGHTS' scrawled across it in black ink.

The band, famous for their hits Atomic, Heart of Glass, One Way or Another and Rapture, were invited to play the Red Rocks music festival in Sochi on February 13 for a five-figure fee.

The free gig would have had an audience of up to 25,000 people on the Olympic main stage, preceded by a medal ceremony.

It would have been sponsored by SberBank Russia, the largest in Eastern Europe and the third-largest in Europe.

But the outspoken singer flatly rejected the offer, joining the likes of Lady Gaga and Madonna in attacking Russia's 'gay propaganda' law.

She wrote: 'Share if you agree... #pass4humanrights #sochi2014'.
