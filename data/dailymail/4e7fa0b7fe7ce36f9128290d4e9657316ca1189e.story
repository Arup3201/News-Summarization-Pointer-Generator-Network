She may be dressed down in a simple white T-shirt and parka jacket – but one part of Kim Sears’ outfit certainly stands out.

Balancing two cups of coffee as she picked up her food shopping, Miss Sears gave the first glimpse of her enormous diamond engagement ring from tennis star Andy Murray.

The former Wimbledon champion proposed to his girlfriend last month with a ring he chose himself, believed to be worth around £200,000.

Experts said Murray, who has an estimated fortune of £30million and earned £11.5million this year alone, had picked out a ‘perfect statement ring’ for Miss Sears, 27, who has been a constant courtside presence during his career. 

Diamond jeweller Lewis Malka said the ring appears to be a three-carat diamond, surrounded by smaller stones for an even greater impact. 

‘It’s the perfect statement ring of the moment; every girl wants a large diamond and this is an exquisite piece,’ Mr Malka added.

‘Knowing how much of a perfectionist Andy is, I would say the colour and clarity is top notch, and I would conservatively value the ring at around £100,000.’

But jeweller and diamond expert Vashi Dominguez said he believed the central diamond was a five-carat stone, meaning the ring could be worth more than £200,000. 

He added: ‘Stepping away from the traditional shapes such as the round solitaire and emerald cut diamond, the couple are clearly choosing a lane of their own with a very loud and bold statement piece.’

Miss Sears – an artist who specialises in pet portraits – has been dating Murray, 27, for nine years. The couple, who live in a £5.6million home in Oxshott, Surrey, are planning their wedding for next autumn, according to Murray’s mother Judy.

They met in 2005 when 17-year-old Miss Sears was at a tennis championship with her father Nigel Sears, a coach. Murray, who is ranked sixth in the world, has credited Miss Sears with helping him to ‘work better’.

Murray wooed her with phone calls and flowers. But she did not allow their burgeoning romance to affect her schoolwork, and she achieved straight As in her exams. 

The couple managed to keep their relationship quiet – until Murray won his first tournament in California in 2006 and ran through the crowd to give his girlfriend a kiss.

They separated briefly in 2009, reportedly because of the sports star’s video games obsession, but rekindled their romance after six months and have stayed together since. 

She has been credited with improving the tennis player’s scruffy appearance and helping him to control his fiery temper on court. 

Murray, who grew up in Dunblane in Scotland, has spoken of the strength he draws from Miss Sears, particularly in the light of his own parents’ separation when he was just 11. ‘I work better in a relationship.

At the end of a day, especially if I’ve lost a match, I don’t like talking about tennis, so it’s nice to have someone to talk to about other stuff,’ he said in 2009. 

In January he jokingly tweeted: ‘We are getting married just after Wimbledon, should be a great day.’ The message prompted Twitter users to offer their congratulations, until he admitted that it was just ‘tongue-in-cheek’. Murray has already spoken of how he would like to have children with Miss Sears.

In his 2013 memoir Seventy-Seven: My Road to Wimbledon Glory, he wrote: ‘I would like to start a family and try to be a good father. That’s important to me. It’s something that I’m starting to think about because Kim and I have been together for eight years.’
