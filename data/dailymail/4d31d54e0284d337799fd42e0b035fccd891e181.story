A Texas Longhorn bull that more than lives up to its name has smashed the record for the world's longest horns.

Seven-year-old JR has horns that measure an incredible 9ft 1ins - and they are likely to grow even bigger.

But even though he has a name derived from a character in Dallas, the ultimate Texas television show, JR does not reside in the U.S.

World record holder: Texas Longhorn bull JR, who lives in Queensland, Australia, has horns that measure an incredible 9ft 1in

Instead, he is part of the largest herd of Texas Longhorns in Australia, roaming around the 1,100acre Leahton Park estate in Queensland.

He has claimed the Guinness World Record from a bull in Ohio called Shadow Jubilee.

But whereas that animal had horns that are 88ins long, JR's measure a staggering 109ins from tip-to-tip.

JR is descended from pure Texas Longhorn stock.

His owner Michael Bethel, 50, who runs Leahton Park with his wife Lynda, 39, began breeding Longhorns 14 years ago.

He said: 'I don't think JR realises how much attention he's getting now he's a record breaker.

'He's just happy and healthy, we don't
give him any special treatment, we just let him graze around with the 
kangaroos like the rest of the heard.

'He's only seven so he still has a 
bit of growing to do yet - they can live until their early 20s - his 
horns could still get bigger.'

The park opened as a tourist attraction three years ago to allow visitors to take horse-drawn wagon tours to see the Longhorns.

Texas Longhorn: By the time of its first birthday, the horns have grown to about 50 per cent of their total tip-to-tip size

Texas Longhorns are bred for their lean meat as well as their striking colour and horns.

Their gentle demeanour means it is extremely rare for a Texas Longhorn to attack a human.

However, care is required when in their vicinity because of the size of their horns, which they use to scratch their bodies.

By the time of its first birthday, the horns have grown to about 50 per cent of their total tip-to-tip size. This growth reaches 95 per cent between five and six years of age.

The horns continue to grow but this rapidly slows down as the bull gets older.

Horns grow from the base, resulting in 'growth rings' that can be seen near the head of older cattle.

Many ranchers sell mounted horns to be hung in homes and public places.

The horns are an official symbol of Fort Worth in Texas, while the Texas Longhorn is the Texas State Large Mammal.

Texas Longhorns are descendants of cattle brought across the Atlantic by the Spanish in the late 1400s and early 1500s.

But the gentle, intelligent cattle had actually come from the Canary Islands, and before then had originated in Portugal.

They finally became a registered breed in the U.S. following the founding of the Texas Longhorn Breeders Association of America in 1964.

However, unlike most cattle, nobody set out to develop them as a breed - they had naturally evolved over the course of almost 500 years.
