The naked rambler Stephen Gough, 53, arrives at court in Fife after being arrested for walking around naked

The man known as ‘The Naked Rambler’ has yet again been arrested for breaching the peace, this time for walking close to a children's play park wearing nothing but his birthday suit.

Stephen Gough appeared before court today following his arrest on Friday in Dunfermline, Fife.

He was released from prison less than a week ago.

The 53-year-old gained his nickname after he trekked from Land’s End to John O'Groats wearing no clothes after leaving his job as a lorry driver.

The former Royal Marine arrived at Kirkcaldy Sheriff Court in Fife in his own security van amid tight security with great care being taken to shield him from curious locals.

However, as he was unloaded from the van, Mr Gough stopped and waived to the waiting photographers.

The charge against Mr Gough, 53, said he conducted himself in a disorderly manner and committed a breach of the peace by walking naked in Cairncubie Road, close to the play park, and refusing to put on clothing or move away from the park.

Mr Gough, from Eastleigh, Hampshire, chose to represent himself rather than be represented by the duty solicitor during his appearance at Kirkcaldy Sheriff Court in Fife, and pleaded not guilty.

In the hearing, which lasted only three minutes, Mr Gough explained his refusal to be represented by citing bad past experiences.

Gough has spent most of the last six years in solitary confinement at HMP Perth.

He has repeatedly been arrested seconds after walking free from the jail in the city's Edinburgh Road.

'Naked Rambler' Stephen Gough has been arrested three days after being released from prison

Upon his release from maximum security Perth Prison last week he said that he planned to walk to England to see his family.

Wearing just a backpack – he vowed to continue walking around Britain without any clothes on – albeit away from busy main roads.

Speaking to the Sun he said: 'It is nice to be standing here feeling the breeze.

'I haven't been outside a building in the last six years and it is nice to smell the flowers and see the greenery.

Predicting his arrest he went on to say: 'I don't know what I am going 
to do. I could get arrested when I go round the next corner,' before 
adding: 'This is my job. This is my vocation in life at the moment. I have absolutely no regrets.'

'To conform with everyone else is the easiest way but when you conform 
you compromise your principles. I am not going to give up. Stay naked is
 the word.'

Last August he was jailed for 657 days for breach of the peace and contempt of court.

The
 breach was for leaving HMP Perth naked at the end of a previous 
sentence, while he was found in contempt for representing himself at the
 city's sheriff court while naked.

He
 was arrested multiple times during his hike from Land's End to John 
O'Groats which began in 2003 and served four months in Inverness Prison,
 eventually reaching John O'Groats in 2004.

He
 returned home but on a flight back to Scotland in May 2006 he was 
detained once again for a breach of the peace after he went to the 
toilet and removed his clothes.

At the hearing for his latest breach today he did not appeal for bail and was remanded in custody.

A trial date was set for August 23, with an intermediate date on August 10.
