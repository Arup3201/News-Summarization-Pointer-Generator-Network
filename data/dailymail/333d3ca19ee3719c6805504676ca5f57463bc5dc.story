The girlfriend of Manchester United goalkeeper David de Gea agreed that the city is 'uglier than the back of a fridge' in a bizarre TV interview.

Singer Edurne Garcia, 29, originally from Madrid, said Spain is much more beautiful than the northern city.

She admitted that the only reason she enjoys spending time in Manchester is because her boyfriend of nearly five years lives and plays there in the interview for Spanish TV. 

Pablo Motos, host of evening light entertainment show El Hormiguero, quizzed her about her trips to the city  before asking her: 'I've been told Manchester is uglier than the back of a fridge.'

She replied: 'It's not very nice, that's for sure. You have to hunt out specific places, the nicer places.

'But even then Spain is nicer. The reason I like it is because David's there. With him being there, everything looks wonderful.'

The singer was chosen to represent Spain at this year's Eurovision Song contest in January.

Her comments have led to speculation she will put pressure on her boyfriend to quit Manchester United when his contract is up at the end of next season.

He was recently linked to a move to Real Madrid although his agent insisted he was happy at Old Trafford 'at the moment' and planned to stay.

The pair met in November 2010 at the recording of a charity CD in Madrid and started dating soon after.

Speaking when she was chosen to perform in Eurovision, she said 'David was happy for me when I told him, just like my family and friends.The people who love you share in your good news.

'David and I are very happy together. 'I think he's going to be tied up with league commitments but I hope he can be there at the final along with my family and friends so we can live the experience together.' 

De Gea, 24, sees his contract expire at Old Trafford at the end of next season.

He joined from Atletico Madrid for £18million back in June 2011 and many believe he will soon be returning to his home city. 

Last month De Gea dismissed rumours of a rift between himself and manager Louis van Gaal as 'lies' but stopped short of committing his future to United.
