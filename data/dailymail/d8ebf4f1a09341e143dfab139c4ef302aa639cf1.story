The lead detective investigating Trayvon Martin's death said his killer should have been arrested, but was told there would not be enough evidence to successfully prosecute.

Chris Serino, of Florida's Sanford Police Department, said he believed George Zimmerman should be charged with manslaughter for the February shooting of the unarmed 17-year-old in a gated community.

But the local state attorney overruled him, saying there was not enough evidence to convict him of the crime, which carries a maximum 15-year sentence.

Speaking out: Trayvon's parents, Tracy Martin and Sybrina Fulton, talked about their son's death at a public forum sponsored by Democrats on Capitol Hill

ABC News made the startling revelation, citing anonymous sources who leaked information about the initial hours of the investigation of the shooting.

If true, it shows that not all law enforcement officers agreed that Zimmerman should go free after he invoked Florida's Stand Your Ground law and claimed to have killed the teen in self-defence.

The fact that Zimmerman was never arrested has sparked outrage across the country and roiled race relations.

Tens of thousands of protesters across the country have marched at rallies supporting Trayvon.

Zimmerman told police he was approached and 'sucker-punched' by Trayvon on February 26 after he followed the boy returning home to his father's home.

Protests: The killing of Trayvon Martin has sparked numerous demonstrations across the country, like this one in front of the White House on Tuesday

He said after Trayvon knocked Zimmerman to the ground, breaking his nose, the teen jumped on top of him and bashed his head against the sidewalk several times.

But apparently Mr Serino did not entirely buy Zimmerman's version of events.

Zimmerman's lawyer said police took him to the station house and questioned him for several hours the night of the shooting, despite his request to go to the hospital.

One likely source of the state attorney's reluctance to charge Zimmerman is the controversial Stand Your Ground law in Florida.

It allows anyone to use deadly force to defend themselves if they have a reasonable belief that they are about to be killed or severely injured.

'The Stand Your Ground law is one portion of justifiable use of deadly force,'  top prosecutor Angela Corey told ABC News.

The Daily Caller, a conservative news site, has published 152 pages of tweets it says were copied from Trayvon Martin's Twitter account before it was taken down.Here is a small sample of the messages by a user with the handle '@NO_LIMIT_N***A' sent and received in the months before Trayvon's death:    (From a cousin): Yu ain't tell me yu swung on a bus driver    PLZZ EXERCISE YO RIGHT 2 REMAIN SILENT..

'And what that means is that the state 
must go forward and be able to prove it's case beyond a reasonable 
doubt... So it makes the case in general more difficult than a normal 
criminal case.'

Yesterday, Martin's parents spoke briefly before a Democrats-only congressional panel as cameras clicked noisily in front of them.

Many in the crowd, which filled the seats and lined the walls, strained to catch a glimpse of them.

'Trayvon was our son, but Trayvon is your son,' Sybrina Fulton, Martin's mother, told the panel.

'A lot of people can relate to our situation and it breaks their heart like it breaks our heart.'

Martin's father, Tracy Martin, thanked 'everyone who is holding the legacy of Trayvon.'

'Trayvon is sadly missed and we will continue to fight for justice for him,' he said.

During the two-hour forum, the lawmakers and witnesses openly criticized the police investigation of the shooting and the failure of police to arrest the admitted shooter, George Zimmerman.

Earlier in the day, House Speaker John Boehner, a Republican, said 'clearly what happened is in fact a tragedy.'

But he steered clear of calling for Zimmerman's arrest as some lawmakers have done.  'It's being investigated by state and federal officials, which I think is appropriate,' said Boehner.

The development's came days after new details emerged about Zimmerman's criminal past.

In
July 2005, the then 21-year-old was arrested at a university bar when 
he became involved in a scuffle with state alcohol agents.

As
one of his friends was being arrested for serving underage drinkers, 
Zimmerman started becoming verbally abusive and pushed an agent.

He was arrested after a scuffle ensued but avoided conviction by entering a pretrial-diversion programme.

A month later, court records show, a woman filed a petition for an injunction against Zimmerman, citing domestic violence. Records show injunctions were later issued in both cases.

In 2006 he was charged with speeding, but the case was dismissed when the prosecuting officer failed to show up in court.

And in 2008 he was pursued for a number of unpaid credit card debts which were eventually resolved.
