Drinking just one can of Coke a day could be bad for you, the World Health Organization said as it urged Americans to lower their daily amount of sugar.

Under draft guidelines published on Wednesday, the health agency suggested sugar should make up just 5 percent of the total calories needed for a day - half of what it had previously suggested.

The guideline means just one Coke, or six Oreo cookies, would be considered an excessive amount of sugar.

Health warning: The amount of sugar in Coke and other sodas concerns experts from WHO

Who recommended the drop in sugar intake as a way to combat obesity and cavities, after its expert panel reviewed about 9,000 studies.

Sugar has about 4 calories per gram, or 15 
calories per teaspoon.

Under the 5 percent guideline, a person who takes
 in 2000 calories a day would limit sugar to 25 grams.

A 12-ounce can of
 Coca-Cola has 35 grams of sugar, which is 10 grams over the allowance.

One Oreo cookie has 4.5 grams, meaning you could eat only five and a half in one day.

The guidelines will apply to sugars 
that have been added to food, or are present in honey, syrups and fruit 
juices. Sugar found naturally in fruits is not cause for concern.

Dr Francesco Branca, WHO's director for nutrition, conceded the target was somewhat aspirational.

'We should aim for 5 percent if we can ... but 10 percent is more realistic,' he said.

Americans and others in the West eat a lot more sugar than the recommended daily allowance of 25 grams.

Their average sugar intake would have to drop by two-thirds to meet WHO's suggested limit.

WHO's new guidelines have been published online and the agency is inviting the public to comment via its website until the end of March.

Many doctors applauded the UN agency's attempt to limit the global sweet tooth.

'The less sugar you're eating, the better,' Dr Robert Lustig, a professor of pediatrics at the University of California and author of a book about the dangers of sugar, said.

'If the sugar threshold is lowered, I think breakfast cereal is going to have a really hard time justifying its existence,' he added, referring to sweetened cereals often targeted to children.

When WHO last revised its sugar guidelines more than a decade ago, it recommended sugar should be less than 10 percent of daily calories.

The U.S. sugar industry was so incensed it lobbied Congress to threaten to withdraw millions of dollars in funding to WHO. A contentious reference to the sugar limit was removed from a global diet strategy, but the recommendation passed.

Lustig said WHO's new guidelines could alter the food environment by forcing manufacturers to rethink how they use sugar in processed foods like bread, soups, pasta sauces and even salad dressings.

He called the amount of sugar in processed food an 'absolute, unmitigated disaster'.

WHO's expert group found high sugar consumption is strongly linked to obesity and tooth decay. It noted that heavy people have a higher risk of chronic diseases, responsible for more than 60 percent of global deaths.

Dental care costs up to 10 percent of health budgets in Western countries and cause significant problems in the developing world.

WHO warned many of the sugars eaten today are hidden in processed foods, pointing out that one tablespoon of ketchup contains about one teaspoon of sugar and that for some people, including children, drinking a single can of sweetened soda would already exceed their daily sugar limit.

There is no universally agreed consensus on how much sugar is too much.

The American Heart Association advises limiting sugar to about 8 percent of your diet, or six teaspoons a day for women and nine for men.

A study led by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention published last month found too much sugar can raise the chances of fatal heart problems.

Researchers found the average American gets about 15 percent of their calories from sugar, similar to other Western nations.

New nutrition labels proposed in the U.S. will also require food manufacturers to list any added sugars, plus a more prominent calorie count.

Dr Branca said: ‘Obesity affects half
 a billion people in the world and it is on the rise.

‘Sugar along with other risk 
factors might certainly become the new tobacco in terms of public health
 action. The consumption of a single serving of sugar sweetened soda 
might actually already exceed the limit for a child. So certainly the 
consumption of sugar-sweetened beverages should be done with great care.

‘It actually is one of the elements that has been more constantly associated to increase weight gain particularly in children.’

Earlier this week, Britain's chief medical officer, Dr Sally Davies, said she thought sugar might be addictive and that the government should consider introducing a sugar tax to curb bulging waistlines.

The UK has one of the fattest populations in Western Europe.

'We have a generation of children who, because they're overweight ... may not live as long as my generation,' she told a health committee. 'They will be the first generation that lives less and that is of great concern.'

The guidelines will now be discussed by 
academics and medical experts before a final version is published. But 
Dr Branca said food and drinks manufacturers should drastically alter 
their products.
