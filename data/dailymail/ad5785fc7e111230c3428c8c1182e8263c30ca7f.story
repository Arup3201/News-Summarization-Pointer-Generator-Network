The Premier League could have five teams in the next season's Champions League after UEFA confirmed the top four and Europa League winner will qualify for Europe's elite competition. 

There was a suggestion the entry for the Champions League from England would be reduced to the top three and Europa League winner - making four - if Tottenham or Everton won the competition.

But UEFA have told Sportsmail they will allow five teams to enter the Champions League if Mauricio Pochettino or Roberto Martinez's side are victorious.    

Everton will gain entry to the Champions League next season should they win the Europa League this term

Spurs will be keen to finish in the top four but have been given an extra route into the Champions League

Chelsea celebrate winning the Champions League in 2012, which denied Spurs a European Cup place

Having each finished in the top four in the last decade, both Everton and Tottenham missed out after rival teams who failed to qualify via the Premier League went on to win the Champions League.

In May a UEFA statement read: 'The Europa League winners could  gain direct access to the group stage, should the Champions League title-holders also qualify via their domestic league, thus freeing up a place in the Champions League group stage.'

Everton, who had previously been tipped for relegation, enjoyed an incredible season to finish fourth in 2005 only for Merseyside rivals Liverpool to beat AC Milan on penalties in the Champions League after a stunning comeback from three goals down.

UEFA decided that Liverpool, as winners, should not be denied a place in the competition and so both teams played in the following season's qualifying rounds.

However, despite finishing fith, Liverpool won the Champions League and so both Merseyside team gained entry into the following season's competition

Everton's Duncan Ferguson celebrates only for his goal against Villarreal to be ruled out by Pierluigi Collina

While the Reds were eventually knocked out in the last 16 by Portuguese giants Benfica, Everton were unlucky to be beaten by Villarreal in the third qualifying round after Italian referee Pierluigi Collina ruled out a Duncan Ferguson header as the Spaniards went on to win 4-2 on aggregate before making it to the semi-finals.

Meanwhile, in 2012, Tottenham were excluded from the Champions League, despite finishing fourth, because of Chelsea's triumph in the competition.

Unlike the Toffees, the north London club went straight into the Europa League rather than being given entry to the Champions League qualifying rounds.

After past disappointments, Everton and Tottenham will be desperate to take advantage of UEFA's recent ruling and make certain of their place on Europe's top table.
