Few games divided opinion like Metro 2033. Many praised the game's wonderful graphics - going so far as to judge other gamers' 'rigs' on whether or not they could run the game at optimal settings.

Others couldn't look past the somewhat clunky gameplay.

Even now, the combined use of MSAA anti-aliasing, advanced depth of field effects, DirectX 10 object-based motion blur and a host of post processing effects is a challenge for most graphics cards. And Last Light will be no different.

What a view: Last Light is set to push PCs to their absolute limit - but can still be enjoyed on mid-range cards

Following on from the events of 2033, you play Artyom, who is part of a dwindling number of survivors living underneath a ruined Moscow. On the surface, animals and humans have been exposed to poisonous substances turning them into ravenous flesh-eating monsters.

Thankfully, Artyom has an exotic array of improvised hand-made weapons at his disposal.

Developer 4A games have optimised their 4A engine, allowing it run faster than in its predecessor. The already eye-poppingly realistic textures have been made even more detailed, through the use of 2048x2048 textures, and geometric detail has improved through extra environmental and object-based tessellation.

The Nvidia Titan is one of the
 most powerful graphics cards in the world. The single-chip card uses the same technology behind the world's fastest super computer. It has its own 
vapor chamber, allowing heat to escape and features a dynamic fan to prevent the card
 from overheating.

Similar to 2033, Last Light also features hardware-accelerated NVIDIA PhysX effects.

This allows for the realistic destruction of scene objects during combat, 
and the enhancement of other game elements, such as particle effects.

It's for these reasons that the developers recommend the game be played using either one of the two fastest graphics cards around, these being the Nvidia Titan and the flagship GTX 690. No details have emerged yet on the optimum AMD equivalents.

However, those with lesser cards can 
still enjoy the game, too - as 'optimum settings' is likely to represent
 1080p resolution at 60 frames per second.

Photorealistic? Metro: Last Light features more open expanses than its claustrophobic predecessor - a likely reason behind the immense hardware demands

On the mid-range to high GTX cards, for example the 670 or above, you're likely to see the same graphical fidelity just at a lower frame rate - a spokesperson at Nvidia confirming to MailOnline that the game will still be 'very playable'.

Last Light will also support Nvidia 3D, however, only the most powerful PCs will be able to run the game at its best using that display.

Although console owners will likely see a dip in visual quality, the 4A engine will squeeze every last drop of power from the aging Xbox 360 and PS3.
