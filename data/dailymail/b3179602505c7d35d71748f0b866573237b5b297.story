A Northern Virginia woman was horrified on Friday when she discovered a 4-inch bolt weighing several pounds had smashed straight through her dining room ceiling.

Homeowner Abby Baker first believed the heavy hunk of metal was part of a burst pipe.

But when workers came to assess the bolt, they pointed out the it probably fell from an airplane and hit the house, which sits directly in the flight path of the Washington area’s busy Dulles airport.

Big bolt: A 4-inch, 2-pound metal object crashed through Abby Baker's Northern Virginia home on Friday and now the FAA has become involved

Now officials are scratching their heads as they ponder what part of a plane the object comes from and whose aircraft is missing a bolt.

Baker first saw the object and the fist-sized hole it left in her ceiling on Friday morning when she returned home from taking her child to school.

‘At first, I thought maybe a gas pipe burst or something, and then I found this piece here that I thought maybe was a pipe from a gas pipe,’ Baker told WRC-TV. ‘But when I had the gas company come out, they identified it as likely a piece of aircraft.’

With the location of Baker’s beneath the constant comings and goings of countless aircraft, the assessment made sense.

But can an aircraft function without such a large bolt?

Sky is falling? Baker initially believed the bolt came from a burst gas line but service workers say it's more likely from an airplane and now the FAA in on the case

‘We have no idea if it's an aircraft part or where it came from and we have to investigate it,’ said FAA investigator Barry Barbini, who was on the scene Saturday.

According to Barbini, the National Transportation Safety Board was expected to send inspectors to Dulles airport on Monday and also analyse the mystery object.

‘We need to do some ground work to see if any airlines have reported any incident with one of their aircraft,’ Barbini said.

Meanwhile, Baker just can’t help but ponder the ‘what ifs.’

‘Had it been a little this way or a little that way it could have hit my dog. It could have hit the kids in the elementary school if they had been playing out over there,’ she said. ‘And that's scary to me for sure.’
