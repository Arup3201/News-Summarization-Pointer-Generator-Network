Nintendo's Wii U console will go on sale in time for Christmas, the firm said today.

The Wii U console has a radical touchscreen controller aimed at fending off increased competition from Apple's iPad in the lucrative gaming market.

It will go on sale in the US on November 19th, the UK on on November 30th, and Japan on the 6th December.

UK and European prices have not been announced, but the deluxe ‘Premium’ model costs $349.99 in the US.

The Nintendo Wii U will go on sale in Japan on December 8th, the gaming firm announced today.

Nintendo's president announced the prices on Thursday.

The creator of Super Mario is fielding the successor to its hit Wii console in the run-up to the busy year-end shopping season and is battling to woo gamers with Microsoft Corp , Sony Corp and more recently tablet and smartphone makers including Apple Inc.

Supporting two 'GamePad' controllers designed to look and function like tablets, the first new console from Nintendo in six years will come with a social-gaming network function dubbed 'Miiverse' installed and will be its first machine in 16 years to launch with a dedicated Super Mario game title.

The addition of Miiverse, a 'facebook for gamers' suggests Nintendo - which started out in 1889 making playing cards in the back streets of Kyoto before gaining prominence as the creator of the ‘Super Mario’ franchise - may be relying on online content delivery to underpin hardware sales through its new Nintendo Network, a similar strategy to Sony and Apple.        

However, Nintendo President Satoru Iwata has been slower than others to take on online social and content delivery platforms, and has a lot of ground to make up to catch up with the millions of subscribers plugged into PlayStation 3's network, iTunes and Microsoft's Xbox.

Keza MacDonald, UK Games Editor for IGN.com, said: 

'All eyes are on retailers to see what price the console will sell for in the UK. In America and Japan, it remains relatively cheap for a brand-new gaming console like the Wii U. 

'Their decision to price under the equivalent of £250 price is a great decision for Nintendo, especially given that the next Xbox and PlayStation are likely to cost much more and aren’t expected until the end of 2013 at the earliest. 

'If the price becomes considerably more experience in the UK many gamers would be tempted to hold off and save up for next year. 

'This has could be a very successful launch if Nintendo can even persuade a small percentage of the 96m Wii owners to upgrade.'

The console has a large touchscreen controller which can act as a 'second screen' for games, showing players alternative views.
