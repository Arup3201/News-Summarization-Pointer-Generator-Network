A female robber has admitted killing a 67-year-old family friend and leaving her body under a pile of Christmas presents at her house, police say.

Patty White, 40, of York, South Carolina, was arrested for allegedly murdering Michele O’Dowd in her home in Jacksonville, Florida, on Friday.

She stole two of Ms O’Dowd’s debit cards and tried to get money out of her account from two ATMs near the home, authorities said.

‘There is nothing worse than when you walk inside and find your own sister brutally murdered over a stupid debit card,’ Ms O’Dowd’s twin-brother Phil Axt told WTEV.

Mr Axt found the body at the ransacked house on Friday morning in bed with a pile of Christmas presents on top of her, reported WBTV.

Ms O’Dowd knew White and used to let her stay with her when she had nowhere else to go, police said.

A police spokesman said: 'Whatever took place inside that apartment went horribly wrong and (White) wound up beating and killing (Ms O'Dowd).'

Police found White on Saturday when they pulled over a car driven by her mother - and she soon confessed to the murder, police told CBS Charlotte.

‘From the time we were notified, the ball rolled pretty quickly,’ Lieutenant Rich Caddell told WBTV.  

‘Our concern was (that although) the crime wasn't committed in the city, someone capable of committing that crime was here.’

White is currently being held in South Carolina but is expected to be extradited back to Florida and will be charged there, police say.
