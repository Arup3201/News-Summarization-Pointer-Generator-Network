Nigel Farage yesterday said 'the basic principle' behind parts of Enoch Powell's notorious Rivers of Blood speech was right

Nigel Farage yesterday said ‘the basic principle’ behind parts of Enoch Powell’s notorious Rivers of Blood speech was right.

The UKIP leader was asked if he agreed with a statement about how the ‘indigenous population found themselves strangers in their own country’.

He said it was true – but appeared thrown when he was told the statement was made by the controversial Tory minister of the 1960s.

The passage from the speech read to Mr Farage was: ‘The indigenous population found themselves made strangers in their own country, their wives unable to obtain hospital beds in childbirth, their children unable to obtain school places, their homes and neighbourhoods changed beyond recognition.’

Mr Farage said it was true ‘in a lot of England’ – before being told on Sky News that it was part of the 1968 warning of racial violence that led to Mr Powell being sacked from the Tory front bench and politically marginalised.

He said: ‘Is it? Well, what he was warning about is that if you have a large influx of people into an area that changes an area beyond recognition, there is tension, that basic principle is right.’

Asked if Mr Powell ‘saw it coming’, he replied: ‘Well no ... for different reasons, for different reasons and on a completely different scale.

‘I mean when immigration was being discussed in the 60s and 70s and 80s we were talking about an annual net inflow to the country of between 30,000 and 50,000 people.

‘What we have had in the last 13 years is net four million extra migrants who have come to Britain so we are dealing with something now on a scale that hitherto we couldn’t even have conceived.’

Mr Farage was read part of the 1968 warning of racial violence that led to Enoch Powell being sacked from the Tory front bench and politically marginalised

In 2008, Mr Farage courted controversy by naming Mr Powell as his political hero in an interview and saying the country would be better today if his words had been heeded.

He said at the time: ‘I would never say that Powell was racist in any way at all.’

Mr Powell, then shadow defence spokesman, had told a Conservative association meeting that Britain was mad to allow in 50,000 dependants of immigrants every year – and compared it to a nation building its own funeral pyre. He said: ‘Like the Roman, I see the river Tiber foaming with much blood.’

Mr Powell lost his job after the speech, which was denounced by Tory leader Edward Heath.
