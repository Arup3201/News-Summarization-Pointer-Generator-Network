Four of Lance Armstrong's former teammates are set to testify against the superstar cyclist in an ongoing doping investigation, according to stories in The New York Times and three European newspapers.

The reports claim George Hincapie, who was by Armstrong's side for all of his seven Tour de France victories, as well as Levi Leipheimer, Christian Vande Velde and David Zabriskie are collaborating in the probe launched by the United States Anti-Doping Agency.

But the riders will remain in the Tour de France and the USADA and teams involved have denied reports that they will face a six-month suspension from September.

The news stories - in De Telegraaf in Amsterdam, El País in Madrid and La Gazzetta dello Sport in Milan on Thursday - marked the first time names have been publicly linked to an alleged list of 10 witnesses that the agency said it has to support claims that Armstrong was the centre of a doping conspiracy from 1999 to 2011, according to Velo News.

Armstrong retired from cycling last year and denies ever doping.

He has until Monday to decide whether he will challenge or accept the charges against him, which carry a lifetime ban from Olympic sports, his spokesman, Mark Fabiani, told the New York Times. He can, however, extend this by five days.

If he contests the charges, the case will go to an arbitration hearing but if he loses, Armstrong would be stripped of his record seven yellow jerseys.

Velo News reported a UCI - International Cycling Union - official as saying that the doping agency hadn't shared any information with it concerning the Armstrong investigation so it was therefore impossible for it to consider suspending any riders or staff.

Armstrong’s former team manager, Johan Bruyneel, his former trainer, Michele Ferrari, two team doctors and a team trainer are also charged.

According to the Times, Hincapie, Leipheimer, Vande Velde and Zabriskie, who all were on the 2008 Olympic cycling team, pulled their names in June from the pool of riders vying to make America's team for the London Games because of their involvement in the probe.

USADA chief executive Travis Tygart would not comment to the Times on who would be stepping up to the witness stand.

He said in a statement that any potential witnesses could face 'unnecessary scrutiny, threats and intimidation.'

'It is important to remember that the truth would often be suppressed without witnesses who at great cost to themselves are willing to tell the truth under oath about what they saw and experienced, and any attempt to circumvent the proper procedures in order to bully or silence people who may or may not be witnesses cannot be tolerated,' he said.

Tygart added that no cyclist had yet 
been punished in connection with the Armstrong case.

He was denying a report in
De Telegraaf that the four men and 
Jonathan Vaughters, a former Armstrong teammate who now runs the 
Garmin-Sharp team, brokered a deal with the anti-doping agency to serve 
six-month suspensions for their own doping in connection with a 
suspected conspiracy.

Vaughters told reporters that the story was 'amateur'.

'That article was essentially irresponsible,' he said, according to Velo News. 'There was not any source. That's not my choice. That's their decision (to publish the names).'

Meanwhile, Armstrong let rip on Twitter that some of his former teammates were receiving immunity for feeding the agency information.

'Come in and tell @usantidoping exactly what they wanted to hear in exchange for immunity, anonymity and an opportunity to continue to race the biggest event in cycling,' he said.

He also said the 'riders in question' are also 'victims of @usantidoping’s unfair process and antics.'
