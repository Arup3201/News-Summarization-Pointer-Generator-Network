Carlo Dellaverson, 30, allegedly made a sex tape of his former girlfriend without her knowing 

An NBC producer was charged today after he allegedly made a sex tape with his unsuspecting girlfriend and then posted the video on a porn website.

Carlo Dellaverson, 30, who is an NBC News digital producer, allegedly filmed the couple having sex on Valentine's Day on a hidden camera in their shared New York City apartment.

He then later posted the clip of his girlfriend on XTube, a police source told the New York Post. 

The 30-year-old's deception was only discovered when his girlfriend found the sex tape on September 4 on his computer.

She promptly moved out of the apartment after ending their relationship. 

The woman, who is not identified, emailed Dellaverson to ask why he would have done this and he reportedly admitted that he had put the tape online, police told the Post.  

The 29-year-old victim filed a police report and her ex was charged today with disseminating unlawful surveillance and harassment.

Dellaverson, originally from Hastings-on-Hudson, is the son of a former top boss at the New York transit authority, Gary Dellaverson.

MailOnline was awaiting a comment today from NBC. 

The 30-year-old was a news editor for Rock Center with Brian Williams but it is unclear if he remains in this role. 

In 2012, the University of Richmond graduate featured in a house-hunting profile piece with The New York Times in which he described moving from 'three frat-pad apartments with three guys' to owning his $425,000 bachelor pad in Greenwich Village.

The studio has good flow and a separate sleeping area, and was a short subway ride to work. He lived his parents to save money for the apartment. He bragged that they didn't charge him rent and his mom would do his laundry and cook him dinner. 

Calls to Dellaverson went unanswered today.
