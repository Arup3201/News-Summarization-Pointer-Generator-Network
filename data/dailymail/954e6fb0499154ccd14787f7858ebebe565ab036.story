Traditionally, buying products in bulk was a guarantee of getting more for less.

But the truth in the modern supermarket could be very different with evidence that everything from cornflakes to coffee may be cheaper in smaller packs.

A survey of big brands suggests that shoppers need to arm themselves with calculators if they really want to get value for money when touring the aisles.

For example, Asda was offering a double pack of two 350g blocks of popular Cathedral City cheddar cheese at £6.98. But it cost £4 to buy two 350g individual blocks.

A similar pattern was seen with a large 500g jar of Nescafe coffee. Britain’s second biggest supermarket was charging £11.50, but it was possible to buy two 300g jars for £10 at the supermarket.

A 1kg box of Kellogg’s cornflakes was selling for £3.38, but a 750g box was only £2.

The mismatch tends to happen when supermarkets cut the price of small packs for a temporary promotion – or to match reductions at a rival.

But the result is that shoppers can no longer rely on the belief that bigger packs automatically mean they are getting more for less.

A similar problem was found at Sainsbury’s where, for example, it was selling an 18 pack of Peroni beer for £23, which works out at £1.28 a bottle. A 12 pack was £13, which was £1.09 a bottle.

Tesco, the biggest supermarket chain, was selling a 350g jar of Loyd Grossman’s tomato and basil sauce at £1, which means two jars adding up to 700g would cost £2. But one larger 660g jar was £2.79.

At Waitrose a 700ml bottle of Absolut Vodka was £19.60, but a 350ml bottle cost £9. Kiti Souninen, retail expert at analysts Mintel, said: ‘It does make you question whether supermarkets take  advantage of the vast majority of consumers who assume bulk  buying is cheaper.’

Only last week Tesco was fined £300,000 and ordered to pay £65,000 costs at Birmingham Crown Court after admitting its promotion on punnets of ‘half-price’ strawberries costing £1.99 was bogus because the original price of £3.99 had only applied for a short period.

But supermarkets are only at risk of breaking the law if they promote a product with a poster or sticker that boasts ‘Bigger Pack, Better Value’ when this is untrue. In the examples in the survey, there were no such claims, which means they were doing nothing illegal.

Richard Lloyd, executive director at consumer group Which?, said: ‘When household budgets are squeezed, it’s unacceptable that shoppers are confused into thinking that they’re getting a good deal when that might not be the case.’
