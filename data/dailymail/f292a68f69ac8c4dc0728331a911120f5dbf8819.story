Arsenal have opened talks with Theo Walcott over a second new contract in two years.

Walcott made his first Arsenal appearance in 10 months following a serious knee injury, coming on as a late substitute in Saturday’s 3-0 win over Burnley.

The England forward would enter the final year of his contract at the end of the season, a scenario Arsenal are keen to avoid, and they have held initial discussions regarding an extension.

Manager Arsene Wenger wants to pre-empt any uncertainty over Walcott’s future by signing him to a longer deal.

Walcott ended a saga by signing a three-and-a-half-year extension in January 2013 worth around £90,000 per week.

Just 38 appearances later, Walcott is on course for another.

Wenger confirmed: ‘We are starting to sit down with him. He has one and a half years to go in December. It is never an easy job with him.

'It should be his best years from now because he is 25, so hopefully we can profit from that.

‘He is a unique player, a player who has been here a long time and who gives us something different. He has been tremendous for the last few seasons. To have him back can only be a bonus for me.’

Walcott could feature again from the bench in the Champions League clash against Anderlecht. The former Southampton man’s return to fitness comes as a huge boost to Wenger, who is without six first-teamers due to injury, including Mesut Ozil, Laurent Koscielny and Mathieu Debuchy.

Despite Walcott’s lack of match fitness the Arsenal manager says he is happy for him to report for international duty next week ahead of England’s clashes against Slovenia and Scotland.

‘I’m happy for him to go with England, he needs competition and games,’ said the Frenchman. ‘For us, he needs hard training. Will I use him from the bench against Anderlecht? I haven’t decided yet.’

Provided results go their way, Arsenal can secure their passage into the Champions League knockout stages with two games to spare by beating Anderlecht, but Wenger insists his side will not take their foot off the gas during the final two group games as they look to clinch top spot above Borussia Dortmund.

Arsenal have finished second in their group in the previous two seasons, and both times they have been eliminated in the last 16 by Bayern Munich. In 2011 they also finished second and ran into a Lionel Messi-inspired Barcelona in the first knockout round.

Wenger is determined to reduce the chances of meeting one of Europe’s superpowers in the next round by finishing top of the group.

‘Before, we played Bayern twice, we played Barcelona as well,’ said Wenger. ‘It is always better you finish first because in some way you feel guilty if you don’t finish first and you think, if you are punished, it is down to you because you finished second.

‘Let’s do the job against Anderlecht and then we will see. I believe every win makes you strong and every defeat makes you weaker, so no matter what happens we will try to play until the end.

'It will be satisfying for me to qualify after four games, it will be job done. We want to take that opportunity, we are on a good run and we want to take advantage of that.

‘They gave us a tough game in the first match. We had a bit of a miraculous win in Anderlecht, needing to go into the last minute, but that was our quality in the game.

‘We have been warned. We learned a lot from the first game and now we want to win the game at the Emirates.’

Wenger will go into Tuesday's clash without Jack Wilshere who has picked up a virus. The England international, who is also suffering from a minor knee injury, missed Monday's training session but did report to the club’s London Colney HQ.

The midfielder is expected to be fit for Saturday’s clash against Swansea and for England duty next week.

Wenger revealed that Aaron Ramsey has also been ill over the past few days but said that no other Arsenal players have been affected by the bug.
