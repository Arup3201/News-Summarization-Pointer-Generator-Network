A neatly dressed tourist taking pictures in Times Square was caught off guard when a visibly agitated woman blocked her path and then attacked her.

The 34-year-old long-haired blonde woman was walking with a friend and photographing their surroundings with a point-and-shoot camera when the aggravated passer-by confronted her and stood in her way.

The confrontation at West 46th Street and Broadway, across the street from a Forever 21, led to a verbal exchange which quickly turned into a scuffle.

Attacked: The blonde tourist was knocked down and hit her head which was bleeding profusely

Head wound: The woman hit her head on the ground leaving an open gash

Bad day: The woman looked visibly upset as a police officer came over to help

The alleged aggressor, Deanne Ostbye, 30, was wearing ripped sweat pants and a hooded sweatshirt with the names of New York neighborhoods printed on the front.

Ostbye, from Tacoma, Wash., allegedly knocked the blonde woman knocked down to the ground. The victim's personal belongings were scattered along the sidewalk.

The assaulted tourist was seen on the sidewalk with a bleeding gash on her head when a nearby police officer came over to break up the fight.

The victim looked frightened and shocked, Alberto Reyes, a photographer who captured the incident told MailOnline.

She was taken to Roosevelt hospital where she was treated for her head injury.
