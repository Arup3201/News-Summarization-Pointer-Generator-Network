The spirit of murdered British aid worker David Haines is to live on an uplifting children's tale written by two French journalists held captive alongside him by Islamic State.  

Nicolas Hénin and Pierre Torres are publishing Papa Hérisson Rentrera-t-il à la Maison? – 'Will Daddy Hedgehog Ever Come Home?', on March 11. 

The pair, aged 39 and 30, were kidnapped in Raqqa, Syria in June 2013 and released 10 months later.

They spent time in captivity with Mr Haines, 44, a former RAF aircraft engineer who was kidnapped in March 2013 while working for an aid agency in Syria.

The book's writer Mr Hénin - who has a four-year-old daughter and a one-year-old son - and illustrator Mr Torres, have now paid tribute to Mr Haines as the inspiration behind the sweet tale.  

It tells the tale of a father hedgehog who is carried off in a picnic basket by humans after falling into a picnic basket while foraging for food for his family.

A little boy holds him captive in a box in the garden shed, saying: 'You'll be my favourite animal. I'll teach you tricks and you'll do anything I want.'

The hedgehog manages to escape and heads off on a series of adventures with a cast of helpful animals, including a rat, a cat and an eagle, before finally returning home.

Mr Hénin, whose five-year old daughter is almost exactly the same age as Mr Haines's youngest, Athea, told the Daily Telegraph: 'The idea was to create poetry from the obscene.

'We had dreamed together about our life after the ordeal and the meeting of our two daughters.

'Even if he didn't write this book, his spirit is in this work. His spark is there.'

Though Mr Hénin and Mr Torres both made it back to their families - the French government has denied paying a £12 million ransom for their release - Mr Haines did not as he was savagely beheaded.

British militant Jihadi John, since unmasked as west Londoner Mohammed Emwazi, carried out the horrific murder in September 2014.

Mr Haines' name does not appear in Mr Hénin and Mr Torres' book - written on scraps of paper and card they managed to hide from their captors - but the idea for it came from a game of turning people into animals which started with the former RAF aircraft engineer.

The Frenchmen chose the prickly hedgehog for their book because they are known for finding their way home even if displaced.

At one point the main character spots a squashed colleague on the road he is desperately trying to cross - the only one allusion to the death of a fellow hostage.

As well as Mr Haines the French pair spent time in captivity with freelance journalist John Cantlie, American journalists James Foley and Steven Sotloff and aid workers Peter Kassig and Brit Alan Henning.  

Mr Cantlie is still being held. Apart from him all but Mr Hénin and Mr Torres were murdered by their jihadi captors. 

Mr Torres paid tribute to Mr Haines as a 'great judge of character' who was expert at sorting out disputes between cellmates.
