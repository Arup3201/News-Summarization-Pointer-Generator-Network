A shocked Renate Stumpf, 75, then revoked her response adding: 'Yes, but not today.' 

She apparently hadn't seen her teenage sweetheart, Louis Demetriades, for around 43 years after their first marriage ended.

Lovers reunited: She apparently hadn't seen her teenage sweetheart, Louis Demetriades, for around 43 years after their first marriage ended

Demetriades got back in touch  last December when he decided he wanted to make another go of things.

This weekend he traveled more than 280 miles from his home in Memphis, Tennessee, to surprise Stumpf at work in Fort Smith, Arkansas.

While his ex-wife was stacking shelves and talking to colleagues, Demetriades crept up behind her with a camera crew from Fox News.

He held a sign asking for her to give him a second chance.

Explaining why he decided to visit Stumpf on one of her shifts, Demetriades said: 'It's because she has so many friends here and I knew she would like to share that with them.'

Stumpf seemed to be overwhelmed by the gesture, clasping both hands over her mouth.

She later explained that she will tie the knot with Demetriades eventually but she will have to 'test him a little bit first.'

'Forty-three years is a long time. I will marry him though because he’s a good man,' she added.

Demetriades first met Stumpf during a trip to Germany in 1959.

They went on to marry and have three children together, but around twelve years later their union ended.

There is no word on why the relationship didn't work out but both parties appear to have put the past behind them. 

'[It's the] best Valentine I've ever had in my life.' Stumpf said with a big smile on her face. 

The bride-to-be has been working at Walmart for 25 years. There's no word on what Demetriades has been up to over the past few decades.
