Standing at a staggering 2,073 feet, China's Shanghai Central Tower has reached its peak following nearly six years of construction.

With a cheer, a wave and a peace sign, construction workers were pictured on Sunday putting the finishing touches to what has been hailed a symbol of 'China's boundless future'.

Secured with safety ropes and harnesses, the builders sat astride the final truss on the top of the world's second-tallest skyscraper.

Topped out exactly a year ago, Shanghai Tower was already China's highest building. But its global 
position was cemented as the last part of its roof was 
secured, bringing it to its full height.

It is now second only in the world to Dubai's Burj Khalifa, which stands at a staggering 2,716 feet.

Under
 construction since November 2008, at a reported cost of $4.2billion, the 121-storey Shanghai Tower completes a triad of skyscrapers that now 
loom over the horizon of the world's most populous city.

When it opens next year, the building will include offices, shops, public 
spaces and a 320-room Four Season Hotel that will be the highest in the 
world.

Special moment: As the last part of its roof was secured, the tower was brought it to its full height of 2,073 feet 

Its completion is likely to further the Chinese government's ambition to make a global financial centre in Shanghai, which is already the world's busiest container port and the gateway to China's heavy industries.

At its topping out ceremony last year, principal architect Jun Xia said the Central Tower and its sisters, the Jin Mao Tower and the Shanghai World Financial Centre, 'will serve as a stunning representation of our past, our present and China’s boundless future.'

The tower is expected to open in the middle of next year.
