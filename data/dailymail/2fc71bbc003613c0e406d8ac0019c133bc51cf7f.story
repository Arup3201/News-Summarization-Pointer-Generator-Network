For the author of one of this year’s most talked about books, a slot at Britain’s best-known  literary event seemed a formality.

But David Goodhart has been dramatically snubbed by the Hay festival and not invited to be a speaker.

Organiser Peter Florence considers his book about immigration ‘sensationalist’ and out of kilter with the annual event’s liberal audience.

In turn, Mr Goodhart, director of the Left-leaning Demos think-tank and one of the country’s foremost liberals, accused Mr Florence,  educated at public school and Cambridge, of having an ‘ideological spasm’.

Anger: David Goodhart, who is director of left-wing think tank Demos, says he has been excluded by Hay organisers because they don't agree with his new book on immigration (right)

The writer, 56, also criticised him for declaring the book was ‘not very good’ despite not having read it. Critics have also accused organisers of suppressing free speech at the event running from last Thursday to next Sunday.

At the centre of the row is The British 
Dream: Successes and  Failures of Post-war Immigration, which takes a 
sceptical view of large-scale immigration.

The book, extracts of which  featured in the Daily Mail before its April publication, divided opinion.

Opinion: Hay Festival Director and founder Peter Florence has said Goodhart wasn't invited because his book 'isn't very good'

But reviewers from across the political spectrum agreed it was an important work.

For example, Trevor Phillips, former chairman of the Equality and Human Rights Commission, said: ‘Finally: a European liberal who isn’t afraid of his own shadow and a British intellectual who isn’t allergic to evidence. No intelligent person can afford not to read this book.’

So it came as a surprise to Mr Goodhart when he received no interest from the festival, which attracts about 80,000 visitors to Hay-on-Wye in Powys.

A forthright exchange of emails followed between Mr Florence and the author, who has attended Hay as a speaker or visitor for 15 years

Yesterday the writer told the Mail: ‘I tried to persuade him to give me a slot. He listed various reasons he was “wary” of the issue.

First was that Hay is “to celebrate pluralism and multi-culturalism on a global scale – to imagine the world beyond Little Britain”.

‘Second, he said he did not like the “numerical” way the immigration debate is framed and produced an anecdote about the horrible abuse of an Afghan asylum seeker.’

In an extract he adapted from his book for the Mail, Mr Goodhart argued that among ‘Left-leaning Hampstead liberals’ like himself there was an assumption that anybody expressing alarm at the largest influx of incomers in this nation’s history was a racist.

But, he said, they were wrong as mass 
immigration, without integration, has had a profoundly adverse effect on
British democracy and social cohesion.

Mr Florence. 48, who founded the Hay festival with his father Norman in 1988, also referred to a 2004 article by Mr Goodhart.

It was written for Prospect magazine and said ‘to put it bluntly, most of us prefer our own kind’.

Mr Goodhart went on: ‘Third was his background. He said, “I’m a second 
generation Briton from a mixed marriage and I thought your 2004 essay 
was unrecognisable with my experience and the experience of most people I
know”.

‘To be fair, he did acknowledge he was responding in a muddled and 
emotional way. He did say he would think about giving me a slot but then
never got back, despite emails from me.

‘When it was clear he was not interested, I booked a slot at the other 
Hay [HowTheLightGetsIn festival of philosophy and music] which 
is where many people say the energy is now, compared to the staid main 
Hay festival.’

He added: ‘Perhaps [Peter] salves his conscience by deciding against 
obviously suitable books that he disagrees with –  a kind of ideological
spasm.’

The row was stoked when Mr Florence  told a gossip columnist this week that Mr Goodhart’s work was ‘partial, predictable and sensationalist’.

He was also quoted in The Guardian newspaper saying the writer ‘was never invited, the book isn’t very good’.

Yesterday Mr Goodhart said: ‘He said to me he had not read the book in February. He may now have read some of it, though I think he probably read a short extract in the Mail.

‘He is entitled to his opinion about the book but it has been endorsed by some pretty heavyweight people.

‘Peter’s reaction is not typical of the reaction which has, in the main, been pretty sober and reasonable even on the liberal Left and shows how much healthier and more open the debate has become since 2004 when I was castigated by many.

‘I’m surprised that he allows himself to overrule what would have been a good and topical book event because of his own views. I think that’s very lazy thinking.’

Accusing Mr Florence of running the festival like a ‘personal fiefdom’, he added: ‘Peter doesn’t like it because he doesn’t agree with it but that’s not a reason if you run a literary festival.

‘I’m disappointed because I’ve been going there for so long.’

The spat has spread to Twitter, where Labour peer Lord Adonis wrote: ‘How about some free speech at the Hay Festival? Extraordinary that David Goodhart told his views on migration unacceptable for debate’.

He also accused Mr Florence of ‘liberal intolerance’.

But Mr Goodhart, a married father-of-four, who lives in North London, told the Mail: ‘I am not some kind of dissident! Of course, Peter has the right to exclude me – I also have the right to complain about it. A lot of people think it’s an odd decision.’

Mr Florence was yesterday at the festival and a spokesman for the event said: ‘He has no comment at all to make.’
