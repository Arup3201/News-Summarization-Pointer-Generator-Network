The families of Andrew Chan and Myuran Sukumaran visited the Bali Nine ringleaders on Australia Day as Indonesia announces that their executions will not be ordered for at least another week.

Chan's older brother Michael arrived first at Kerobokan prison in Denpasar, Bali, on Monday followed by Sukumaran's mother Raji, wearing dark sunglasses.

Sukumaran's younger brother, Chintu, walked into the jail with his younger sister, Brintha, both looking visibly upset after the visit - which may be one of the last times they see their sibling alive.

The relatives of Chan, 31, and Sukumaran, 33, who have had their pleas for presidential clemency rejected and are on track to face the firing squad, were accompanied by the Australian consul-general Bali Majel Hind.

As their lawyers are in the process of applying for a second judicial review, Bali governor, Made Mangku Pastika, says he believes most Australians would support the execution of Chan and Sukumaran for heading an operation to smuggle 8kg of heroin into Australia in 2005.

'I think that our brothers and sisters from Australia will agree with the process and law here,' he said.

Spokesman for Indonesia's attorney-general, Tony Spontana, said the executions of six drug offenders last week were still under evaluation.

'Evaluation on the first execution implementation is predicted to be finished this week,' he said on Monday, Channel Nine reported.

'After the evaluation of the first executions is finished, then we will prepare for the second round.' 

Kerobokan prison governor Sudjonggo told reporters he saw Sukumaran meeting his mother and siblings in the visitors' hall, and Chan with his brother in a separate room.

'I don't want to bother them, let them make the most of the visiting hours,' he said.

'They have asked for more relaxed visiting hours, and with that, maybe (Sukumaran and Chan) will be stronger.'

The families of Andrew Chan and Myuran Sukumaran (seen as a child in picture above) are pleading for mercy

The families made a desperate plea to Indonesia's president to reconsider the pair's executions in light of the work they have done to improve the lives of fellow inmates.

On Thursday, Chan's last ditch attempt at a clemency bid was rejected by President Joko Widodo , following Sukumaran's rejected bid in December, officially exhausting the  legal appeals against their death sentence for attempting to smuggle heroin into Australia.

The decision comes as Australian media personalities, including Asher Keddie and Alan Jones, have joined the campaign initiated by artist Ben Quilty to request mercy from Indonesian authorities. 

Quilty, who became a mentor and close friend of Sukumaran after he was jailed, has used his creative talents to create a powerful video in support of the pair.

Claudia Karvan,  Missy Higgins Megan Washington, and  Andrew Denton are among those who have come forward to take part in the I Stand For Mercy video.

'The message is just for the boys to know there are people walking with them in this very dark time,' Quilty told news.com.au. 

The 41-year-old is trying to organise a candlelight vigil for the pair, to 'send a strong message to the men themselves and their families that there are a lot of prominent Australians in the arts, media and all parts of our community who are on their side.'

'I want the barristers to walk into that prison and tell the boys how many people are thinking of them and supporting them,' he said.  

The relatives of Chan, 31, and Sukumaran, 33, said they were devastated to hear the decision about the clemency bids, and pleaded for the president to visit the pair in Kerobokan Jail.

Raji Sukumaran, Myuran's mother, said that she was 'sure he would not have the heart to order them to be executed' if he saw their efforts towards reforming themselves and every aspect of the running of the jail.

Mrs Sukumaran told The Sydney Morning Herald that she was confident that if the president could see how much they had changed he would put a stop to the executions, which have been scheduled to happen this year.

The pair have been on death row since 2006, and could face death as early as next Sunday under a crackdown by the Indonesia government on drug cases.

Ranjini Sukumaran, the mother of Bali Nine ringleader Myuran Sukumaran, said that he is a different person

Myuran's younger brother Chinthu Sukumaran said that Indonesian authorities needed to actually visit the prison to see the changes that had occured.

'Everyone who goes in there and spends a couple of minutes, they are just very impressed,' he said.

The pair have dedicated much of their time to advocating against the very illegal activity that landed them in jail - drugs.

Chan and Sukumaran have also instigated tertiary courses in computer studies, arts, English, and graphic design.

Sukumaran is only a year away from completing his Bachelor of Fine Arts through Monash University, and along with Chan has aided the introduction of cooking, philosophy and psychology lessons and a first aid course.

Bali locals have made a show of support, coming out to buy Sukumaran's art in the wake of his rejected clemency appeal.

His mother made an emotional appeal on Saturday, speaking of how sorry her son was and how much he had changed as an individual.

'No mother should have to go through this, it's killing us. Please, something has to be done, please help,' Channel Seven reported Mrs Sukumaran as saying. 

Mrs Sukumaran said that she was 'terrified'.

'I've been told my son will be taken out and shot at any time. I don't know what to do. He doesn't deserve to die.' 

The Australians may only be given several days notice if scheduled for execution, facing the imminent possibility of their death following the recent increase in criminal executions after a five year respite.  

'He was only a teenager,' said Michael Chan, who is planning to fly over to see his brother in the next few days.

Mrs Sukumaran said that she was 'terrified' for her son

'There are no words that would make it better, [it's] just to be there with him,' he said.  

Prime Minister Tony Abbott spoke to both men's families on Friday and said the Australian government was 'continuing to make every possible effort' to stop the executions.

Mrs Sukumaran did not comment on what's being done to try to save her son but said she had full confidence in the Australian government.

'I'm not giving up and I know the Australian government will do everything it can to bring the boys home or even to stop the execution,' she said. 'They can't do this to them.' 

Michael Chan said he was not giving up hope because 'there are things that are being done' that would remain 'behind closed doors'.

But the reality of his 31-year-old brother's fate was hitting home.

'The last couple of days have probably been worse for wear,' he said.

'I don't think I've felt this way, probably, since the beginning when it first all happened. But to know that we're sort of nearing the end of the road is heartbreaking.'   

Chan and fellow inmate Myuran Sukumaran have been on death row since 2006

Mr Abbott (with Indonesian President Joko Widodo, left) said earlier this month that his government would make 'the strongest possible representations' to Indonesia to seek a stay of execution

Despite Indonesian President, Joko Widodo, vowing not to grant pardons for drug smugglers, the attorney-general's spokesman, Tony Spontana, said earlier in the week that there was a chance for the executions to be delayed.

'But with regards to death penalty, we have the mechanism to review the decision,' Mr Spontana said.

'Starting from the decision made by the District Court all the way to decision in Judicial Review, including the clemency decision,' reported The ABC.   

If Chan and Sukumaran are executed under the same conditions that previous inmates have faced, they will be taken from their cells at midnight to face their death with their hands and feet shackled. 

The pair will be offered blindfolds to wear, and will have white aprons around their neck and a red target on their chest.  

Julian McMahon, the pair's Australian lawyer, said that executions were 'not clean killings', and that prisoners may be tied to a plank before being shot.

Chan was arrested at the age of 21 for his role in the Bali Nine drug smuggling ring

'If the prisoner isn’t dead straight away, the commanding officer is meant to walk up and then put a bullet in the head,' Mr McMahon said.

Mr McMahon said that Sukamaran and Chan were traumatised by their impending execution, and often dreamed of being shot in the heart by the prison's firing squad.   

Mr McMahon labelled the potential executions 'chilling', and said that he could not fathom simply taking prisoners outside and shooting them.

'It seemed impossible to be true that they would take out these people on the weekend and just shoot them. That was my first reaction,' Mr McMahon said.
