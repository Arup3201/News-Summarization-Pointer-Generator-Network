Spanish playmaker Juan Mata says Manchester United must be ready to fire on all cylinders ahead of a busy festive schedule.

Louis van Gaal's side face a run of nine competitive games in just 36 days as they look to cement their place in the top four of the Premier League.

And Mata, who impressed for United as they secured a third straight win against Hull on Saturday, says the Red Devils must consolidate their good run of form during a busy December.

Writing on his official blog he said: 'This win (over Hull) adds up to a good run of results. 

'Let’s hope to consolidate that in December, a very busy month that can take us closer to our goals. For a start, we play Stoke this Tuesday, again at home.'

However, Mata's joy at United's latest result was shortlived after learning of the news that a 43-year-old male Deportivo fan was tragically killed in his native Spain, following mass brawls prior to their La Liga clash against Atletico on Sunday.

The man  was taken out of the river suffering head injuries, cardiac arrest and hypothermia, before dying

He added: 'After finishing the training session we were told about the incidents in Madrid prior to the game between Atletico and Deportivo. 

'Sadness... incredulity... I can’t find the words to describe it. As any other sport, football should help to unite, not to divide. 

'This is not the first time that something like this has happened, in Spain or here in England. 

'Such barbarisms must be eradicated, once and for all, through education and common sense.'
