The first-ever video game has been launched in Vietnam offering gamers the chance to commemorate the scene of the country's finest battle.

Aptly titled 7554, it celebrates the day the French army surrendered to Vietnamese troops in the Battle of Dien Bien Phu on 7 May, 1954.

Developers Emobi Games have marked that victory by offering players the chance to become a soldier in the Vietnam People's Army as they relive that momentous clash.

Vietnamese video game creators have launched a new game celebrating the 1954 triumph over the French

Nguyen Tuan Huy, Director of Emobi Games said: 'There has never been a video game of this size and scope from Vietnam and that fact alone gives us a lot of national pride.

'It is our privilege and our challenge to create a first person shooter that gamers will enjoy playing.

'And though 7554 is based on historical events, it is not an attempt to recreate the past, but rather it is a vehicle meant for entertainment.'

Players take their place in the Vietnamese Army in a bid to overcome the French

Emobi Games spent a reported Â£520,000 over three years to develop the title which they hope will launch worldwide in February.

A team of 20 
developers liaised with authorities to ensure the authenticity of the fight from the various details of the fight right through to the green light.

The game commemorates the country's real life victory over the French in the war for independence

And despite the game celebrating defeat over the French, a subtitled version in France is believed to be made available.

Tuan Huy has defended the game insisting it is 'not anti-French.'

And one internet gamer suggested he would be willing to play the game, adding: 'As
 a Frenchman, I was quite angry when I saw it.

'But after all there are many games where you have to 
kill Germans or Russians and they are not complaining. It's just a video
 game.'
