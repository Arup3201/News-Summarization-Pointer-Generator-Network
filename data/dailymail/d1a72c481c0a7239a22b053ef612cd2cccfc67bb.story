He revolutionised the baking industry when he introduced the Cronut.

Now pastry chef Dominque Ansel has turned the world of hybrid desserts upside down again with his newest creation - Chocolate Chip Cookie Milk Shots.

He posted a photo of his new delicacy, which consists of chocolate chip cookie 'glass' filled with shot of milk, on Instagram.

The inspiration for the new product came when after the French chef tried his first Oreo, he told Eater.

He added: 'If everyone was drinking milk with cookies, you might as well make a dessert that allows them both to be combined.'

The desserts will be unveiled in Austin, Texas, on Sunday, when 40,000 people are expected to descent on the city for the annual technology conference.

Last year, Ansel's sell-out Cronuts became so popular they were being sold on Craiglist.

With only 200 cronuts made per day, and a line 30-people deep before the Manhattan bakery even opens its doors, the $5 croissant-donut hybrid has become a hot commodity for sweet-toothed New Yorkers - and opportunists are taking note.

The hybrid doughnut-croissant was quietly unveiled on May 10 last year, when a small batch of 50 were placed on the shelves.

Three days later, when 200 had sold out by 9.30am, one angry and disappointed customer apparently 'flipped the finger' at staff on his way out of the pâtisserie. Now, there is a six-cronut limit per customer.
