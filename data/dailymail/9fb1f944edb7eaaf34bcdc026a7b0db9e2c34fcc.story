A bear is to blame for causing a traffic accident that resulted in the death of a 13-year-old girl Saturday in Boulder, Colorado.

The unidentified teen was riding in a pick-up truck with her father and sister, age unknown, when a vehicle in front of them stopped suddenly to let a bear cross the road.

The father swerved to avoid the stalled car and crashed into swollen Boulder Creek where his daughter was dragged six miles before emergency crews could get to her.

Fatality: A 13-year-old girl in Boulder, Colorado died Saturday after her father crashed into a creek

More than 50 emergency responders assisted in the rescue efforts, but it took more than an hour to reach her due to the creek's fast-moving waters.

'We were in contact virtually the whole way. We had eyes on her,' Lt. Bruce Fenfold of Boulder Fire and Rescue told the Daily Camera.

However, because of the water levels, Fenfold said 'it wasn't as simple as just jumping into the creek to find her.'

Boulder Fire and Rescue diver Brad Lupher told the paper that she was not breathing when pulled from the water. Crews performed CPR.

She was later pronounced dead at Boulder Community Hospital. Her father and sister were able to climb out of the car and to safety.

No names were released. The office said the coroner will determine the cause of death.

The paper said that circumstances surrounding the rescue were made extremely difficult by the unusually high rate at which Boulder Creek has been flowing.

Just two days prior to this incident, tubing had been banned on parts of the creek, as water was flowing as much as eight times the typical rate
