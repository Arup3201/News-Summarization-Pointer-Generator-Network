Christopher Melendez,27, has defied the odds to become a pro wrestler after losing his leg in an IED explosion while serving with the US Army in Iraq

A heroic Iraq war veteran who lost his leg in an IED explosion has defied the odds to become a professional wrestler.

Christopher Melendez, was only 23 days away from returning home when his left leg was ripped off in the blast and he was left fighting for his life.

After being resuscitated three times  the Army Sergeant was flown back to the US where he underwent  surgery to his arm and jaw.

His leg could not be saved. 

Now, eight years on the 27-year-old, has become a professional wrestler and has joined TNA Wrestling.

'Here in TNA, I plan to go straight to the top,' Mr Melendez, who grew up in Spanish Harlem, New York, told Mandatory.com.

'I have the same mentality I had in the battlefield, the same mentality I had during my recovery. I'm going to be the best.'

Mr Melendez joined the army at 17 after being inspired by his father, who served in Vietnam.

He spent three years in Iraq and was deployed to Afghanistan after signing up in 2004.

But, less than a month before he was due to leave Iraq he was caught up in the explosion and lost his leg.

Sergeant Melendez made his professional wrestling debut at the Manhattan Centre in August this year

During his debut fight Mr Melendez defeated DJZ and then Kenny KIng

'When I was able to open my eyes after the explosion I looked across the battlefield to see what I thought was a fellow-soldier in need of help,' he said.

'I quickly realized it was my leg.' 

Melendez was treated at Brooke Army Medical Center in San Antonio, Texas where he quickly recovered and was walking again, with the help of a prosthetic, within 40 days.

Determined not to let the amputation slow him down, Melendez started training to become a professional wrestler in 2012 and was recently offered the contract with TNA. 

 Early in his career Mr Melendez wore his lightweight prosthetic leg, but he has since ditched it in the ring,

 'Every time I have the leg off and I'm standing tall on one leg, that shows other guys, other amputees, civilians and veterans that you can overcome these things,' he told Mandatory.com
