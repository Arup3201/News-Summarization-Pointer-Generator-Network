Jolie has donated $100,000 to the UN for World Refugee Day

Everyone knows that a hair and make-up team are always on standby on a film set, but some stars need it more than others.

Angelina Jolie is certainly in need of regular touch-ups for her latest role and was spotted being pampered on the set of Maleficent in Buckinghamshire today.

The 37-year-old has taken on the role of evil sorcess Maleficient in an adaptation of Sleeping Beauty and to do so, she has undergone something of a transformation.

Playing the part well: Angelina Jolie certainly appeared to be in character  as Maleficent as she wandered across the grass on the first day of shooting of the new Disney movie

Angelina was seen in the middle of a field today in full costume as she continued to film scenes for the upcoming Disney movie.

Wearing
 a long brown cape and black horns, the actress was spied having her 
make-up retouched by a female artist while a male member of the crew 
dealt with her long brunette hair.

It was only yesterday that fans got a sneak peek of Angelina's character and what they can expect from the fairytale film.

Wearing a leather horned headdress, and yellowed contacts, the actress was also given a bit of help in the cheek department with the addition of some Lady Gaga-style cheek prosthetics.

Angelina plays the title role in the updated version of Disney's 1959 animated feature Sleeping Beauty and of her costuming she said: 'We’re experimenting with different things. But the horns are the horns — you can’t deny them. You have to have horns.'

In this updated version, the focus 
of the film centres on the events that hardened Maleficent's heart, leading her to 
curse the baby Aurora (Sleeping Beauty), played by Elle Fanning.

Angelina told EW: 'It’s not anti-princess, but it’s the first time they’re looking at this epic woman.

'I hope in the end you see a woman 
who is capable of being many things, and just because she protects 
herself and is aggressive, it doesn’t mean she can’t have other [warmer]
 qualities'

Impressive: Angelina wore a full-skirted dress underneath a huge coat for the scenes

Heading into the light: Two huge studio lights were shone on Angelina as the natural light began to fade on the set of the film

As a woman who is used to dividing opinion, Angelina was clearly attracted to taking on such a 'imperfect' character.

She said: 'It sounds really crazy to 
say that there will be something that’s good for young girls in this, 
because it sounds like you’re saying they should be a villain. 
[Maleficent] is actually a great person. But she’s not perfect. She’s 
far from perfect.'

Angelina was seen taking her 
family to see musical Wicked based on the novel by Gregory Maguire while
 in London, which similarly tells the story of the Wicked Witch Of The 
West before she turns bad.

Evil: Angelina will play Maleficent, the wicked sorceress from Disney's 1959 animation of the classic fairytale Sleeping Beauty

'In
 general, it’s a very good message to say, “Let’s look at something from
 the other side.” But then also, what our challenge will be  - and the 
script writer [The Lion King and Alice in Wonderland’s Linda Woolverton]
 has already cracked it - is not to simplify it, not to just reverse the
 story but tell a bigger story that doesn’t point the finger [at 
Princess Aurora] either.'

According to the popular fairytale, Maleficent was angry that she wasn't invited to the beautiful Princess's christening,
and as a result cursed the infant to prick her finger on the spindle of a spinning 
wheel and die before the end of her 16th birthday.

Other stars signed up to the film 
include Miranda Richardson, who will play Queen Ulla, and Juno Temple, 
as Thistletwit, one of the three fairies tasked with taking care of 
Aurora in a cottage in the woods - which, going on the set, may now be a
 tent in a small settlement.

She is joined by Imelda Staunton will play fairy Knotgrass and Lesley Manville who will star as fairy Flittle.

But it is still unclear who will play
 Prince Philip, Aurora's love and the man who defeats Maleficent, 
although as other characters' names have been changed, it could well be 
Control star Sam Riley, who is billed to play Diaval.

The Jolie-Pitts have 
made the U.K. their temporary home and have been seen on family outings
to the theatre and stores.

Meanwhile, Jolie has donated $100,000 to the UN to help Syrian refugees to mark World Refugee Day.

'Unfortunately, the world is producing displaced people faster than it is producing solutions to displacement,' the actress said in a statement. 'And the solutions are not exclusively humanitarian – they are also political.

'The international community should rededicate itself to preventing conflict, addressing it when it erupts, and solving it more quickly,” she added, “for that is the only way to create durable solutions for the refugees whose strength inspires us on this World Refugee Day.'
