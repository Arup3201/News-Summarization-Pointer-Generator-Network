A father-of-two has built a career that children around the world can only dream of - making spectacular works of art out of Lego.

Duncan Titmarsh, 42, gave up his stable job as a kitchen fitter five years ago to pursue his unique career.

Now a professional, he is the only person in Britain to be officially recognised by the famous Danish toy company.

Mr Titmarsh, 42, from Farnham, Surrey, has loved Lego since he first played with it as a child.

In a huge warehouse in Bordon, Hampshire, he has a staggering six million pieces of Lego that he uses to carry out his day-to-day work.

He set up and works for Bright Bricks, the UK’s only Lego-certified building company.

He is currently building a Lego engine for a Rolls Royce and recreating the East Village from the London 2012 Olympics.

The most prestigious project he has worked on was the huge 14ft, 400,000-piece Lego Christmas Tree in St Pancras station in 2011.

He also creates large mosaics of pictures and has recreated famous work by artist, Banksy.

Mr Titmarsh says that his friends and family thought he was mad when he decided to become a professional Lego builder but that he loves his job

It takes Mr Titmarsh anything from two days to two weeks to complete his work.

Since becoming a professional Lego maker in 2008 he has made more than 400 bespoke pieces of art using the blocks.

He said: ‘Like most children I loved playing with Lego when I was younger, but I never thought it would be my job later in life.

‘Everyone loves Lego and I picked up my first set in Woolworths when I was just a little boy.

It takes Mr Titmarsh anything from two days to two weeks to complete a piece and he has so far built more than 400

‘I enjoyed making Technic Lego sets and Lego Space when it first came out.’

After working for five years as a kitchen fitter in Farnham, the father-of-two made the brave decision to give that up to pursue his dream.

He said: ‘It was hard at first to make the change, and my family and close friends thought I was mad.

‘But I’m thrilled that I made the change when I did as it’s something that I enjoy doing every day.’

There are estimated to be just three or four people in the world who make a full-time living from building structures of the plastic bricks.

He says that he loves the variety in his work and the fantastic reactions he gets from people when they see his creations

To mark 150 years of London Underground Mr Titmarsh has created a series of Lego London Underground maps showing how the Tube network has evolved over time. The image shows how the map will look in 2020

Being a certified Lego builder allows Mr Titmarsh to buy bricks directly from the Danish company at a discount.

He spends up to eight hours a day in the warehouse building a variety of designs.

He said: ‘I love the variety in my work; you just don’t know what you’re going to be doing each day.

‘Each day is different and until people send in their photographs and designs - I don’t know what I’ll be working on.

‘I love to see the work when it’s finished and the recognition and response I receive from people is fantastic.

‘You could say that it’s every boy’s dream to play and work with Lego for the rest of their life - I love it.’
