Holidaymakers need no longer worry about returning home to an empty fridge.

Waitrose has established a new system that will be allow families to order their groceries on their smartphone from a sun lounger and then pick them up from refrigerated lockers at the airport.

The chain says it wants to install the lockers in ten locations, including the long stay car parks at Gatwick airport terminals as well as London underground stations and other travel hubs.

The move is part of a wider policy by all the mainstream supermarkets to make it easier to order groceries on the web and then collect them without ever having to visit a store.

While retailers see helping returning holidaymakers as a positive, the real boom is expected to be among commuters collecting their shopping on their way home from work from secure lockers.

A whole new network of ‘click and collect’ points to pick up items bought on the web are springing up across the country.

Argos has revealed that shoppers will be able to pick up eBay parcels from 650 stores by the end of this year.

At the same time London Underground and Network Rail have both recently announced plans to turn their stations into pickup points for a host of different retailers, from Sainsbury’s to New Look.

The Waitrose lockers are being tested by staff at the firm’s head office in Bracknell and they will then be installed at branches and other key locations from this autumn.

Shoppers who place an order using Waitrose.com will receive a text message containing a PIN number. They can then drive up to the lockers, enter the number using a touch screen integrated in to the locker unit and collect their groceries.

Multiple customer orders are stored in ambient, chilled and frozen temperature-controlled lockers that can be refilled several times a day.

Commute and go: Tube stations on London's Underground could also see lockers for groceries popping up

In line with the delivery options already available on Waitrose.com, the service is free if the purchase is over £50 and an order placed before 11.45am can be collected the next day.

Waitrose’s eCommerce director, Robin Phillips, said that the company was very excited to be offering the innovative service, which if successful, would be expanded further.

‘We are committed to finding shopping solutions that make the most sense for our shoppers and are as convenient as possible, as well as being ambitious in terms of the technology used,’ he said.

‘Giving our customers as many ways as possible to buy and collect their groceries on the move is key to building on the phenomenal growth seen at Waitrose.com.

‘Collection lockers will unlock the potential to reach customers in locations where we don’t have a shop and which are very convenient, such as on the way home from work or the school run.

‘More and more people are adding an online shopping mission to their way of buying from Waitrose and we will continue to invest in making sure that we give them what they want, when they want it.’

Sales at Waitrose.com have been outperforming the UK online grocery market and were up 50 per cent compared to market growth of 15.2 per cent in the 12 weeks to May 12, according to figures from Kantar Worldpanel.
