Kieran Loveridge will spend at least three additional years behind bars for fatally punching Sydney teenager Thomas Kelly.

Kelly, 18, suffered catastrophic head injuries after Loveridge punched him once in an unprovoked attack at Sydney's red-light district, Kings Cross, on July 7 2012.

His life support was turned off two days later.

Loveridge was jailed in November 2013 for just four years for manslaughter, which prompted wide-spread public anger.

But Kelly's father, speaking outside the NSW Supreme Court of Appeal on Friday, said his family will not be celebrating the new lengthier jail time which comes after a prosecution appeal.

'You can’t balance a life with years in jail,' he said.

Chief Justice Tom Bathurst declared Loveridge would serve a non-parole period of seven years for Mr Kelly's death.

Kelly's younger brother Stuart, 16, made a heartfelt plea outside court on Friday for his brother's short life to have some meaning.

Speaking for the first time to the media he said: 'Up until now I haven't said anything because I was too young. I tried to block it out. I tried to understand over and over why, at such a young age, my brother lost his life so tragically. But I have no answers.'

He added: 'I want Thomas' short life to have some meaning in his death. So we can see change... I believe we should have respect for one another, for friends, family, acquaintances, different cultures and complete strangers. A culture where we accept responsibility for our actions.'

In November 2013, a court heard how 19-year-old Loveridge had drunk several cans of Smirnoff double black vodka drinks and shots as he prowled Kings Cross and told a friend 'I swear I’m going to bash someone'.

Kelly, an accounting cadet, was walking with his girlfriend and talking on his mobile phone when he was violently attacked.

Police originally charged Loveridge with murder but he offered to plead guilty to manslaughter.

It was expected that he would receive a lengthy jail term but his sentence of four-years sparked outrage.

'I can't tell you what it's like to lose a child, 18 years old, who had his whole life in front of him and is considered meaningless by the state because this verdict is so shocking,' Mr Kelly's father, Ralph Kelly, said after the decision.

After community outrage over Loveridge's four-year sentence, the DPP launched an appeal against the leniency of the decision, which was upheld on Friday.

Speaking outside court alongside his wife and son, Ralph Kelly said he and his family were relieved.

'It's difficult - there is no celebration today,' he said.

'You can’t balance a life with years in jail. It’s very bitter sweet as we’re three days away from the anniversary of Thomas’ death.'

Loveridge's mother could be heard sobbing as she hurried from the court room.

The earliest her son can be released from jail is November 17, 2022.
