'Children and adults love to celebrate this fall holiday in all sorts of ways, and it's clear dressing in costume will be a top priority for millions of people this year,' said NRF President and CEO Matthew Shay. 

'Given the popular holiday falls on a Friday this year, retailers can expect increased web and in-store traffic in the weekdays leading up to the big night, meaning consumers will need to keep their eye on specific must-have items as they are likely to go fast.' 

The majority of Americans search for costume ideas online and this year, the survey found visual social media site Pinterest a growing source of inspiration.

Prosper Insights principal analyst Pam Goodfellow, who conducted the survey, said: 'Social media is a great tool for consumers to find inspiration for all of their Halloween activities, including finding tips for decorating their homes and yards, looking for personal and even family costume ideas, and even finding the best deals from retailers.  

She added: 'It's clear people love to get creative with costumes, looking for inspiration from pop-culture and politics to history, and even the make-believe and fantasy world.

'We're surprised each year with the range of different costumes, and I'm sure this Halloween will be no exception, especially given the historic number of people planning to buy costumes for themselves, their children and even their pets.'
