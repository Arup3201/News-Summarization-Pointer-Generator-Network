A woman gave a feeding bottle containing bleach to a stranger's baby, a court heard today.

The 11-month-old boy drank some of the liquid and vomited after being handed the bottle in a branch of McDonald’s in Eltham, south-east London, Woolwich Crown Court was told.

Elaine Joyner, 53, of Deptford, south-east London, is charged with administering a poison or noxious substance so as to endanger life - but Judge Andrew Lees ruled today that she was unfit to plead.

Scene: The 11-month-old boy drank some of the liquid and vomited after being handed the bottle in a branch of McDonald's (pictured) in Eltham, south-east London, Woolwich Crown Court was told

A trial to decide whether Joyner carried out the act went ahead in her absence. Peter Clark, prosecuting, told the jury that the incident took place last September at the McDonald’s branch.

He said: ‘Elaine Joyner, say the prosecution, gave to a complete stranger’s baby a feeding bottle that contained a poisonous or noxious substance, a fluid that contained bleach, or something very similar.

‘The baby, who was 11 and a half months old, took some of that fluid in his mouth and was immediately rendered ill by it. He retched and vomited over himself and turned very pale.’

His grandmother seized it from the pram to prevent further harm, Mr Clark said. The baby - who cannot be identified for legal reasons - made a good recovery with no long-term ill effects, he added.

‘Ingestion of bleach can prove fatal, and in the case of such a young child is particularly hazardous.’

Mr Clark said there was good quality CCTV
from McDonald’s, which did not show the precise handing of the bottle, 
which was just out of shot, but one could see the frame of the pram.

‘You see someone passing a bottle, and you can be sure it’s Elaine Joyner,’ he told the jury.

At the defendant’s home was located 
distinctive clothing and a carrier bag she had worn and carried that 
day, counsel added. Other CCTV footage showed her in the street, walking
with a distinctive ‘waddle’, and going into McDonald’s.

A
statement from the child’s grandmother was read, in which said she was 
looking after the baby in McDonald’s while his mother was at the counter
and she saw him retching and dribbling.

‘I reached for a bottle that was in 
his pram. As I looked into it I noticed it was orange in colour with 
white milk particles in it. It was extremely frothy on the top.

‘I
realised that he had drunk something that we had not given him. Three 
black girls said that a woman had walked past and given him a bottle.’

The
mother said in statement: ‘Some random person had given my baby a 
bottle, which he had drunk from and was vomiting. As far as I was 
concerned, my baby had been poisoned.’

A
statement was read from Joyner’s partner Fred Warwick, 68, who had gone
out that day. Joyner had told him she would be at home for most of the 
day and watching the racing.

She
told him as they were having tea in the evening that she had ‘popped 
out’ to Eltham. ‘Elaine didn’t tell me what time she left or what time 
she arrived home,’ he said.

The judge told the jury: ‘In this case the defendant has been found by me to be unfit to stand her trial.

‘I have decided on the evidence of two specialist medical practitioners, one instructed by the defence, one by the prosecution, that she is mentally ill, such that she cannot understand the proceedings, cannot understand the evidence, and cannot give valid instructions to her legal team.’

It was appropriate that she did not attend, he added. In such circumstances, there would not be a finding of guilty or not guilty, but the jury should decide whether she did the act she was alleged to have done.

Trainee Detective Constable Sandra Voak - formerly a uniformed Police Constable - told the court she had identified Joyner from a CCTV photograph from that day last September as someone she had dealings with in 2011.

She said she spent an hour with her in July that year, including 15 minutes sitting next to her in a car.

Asked by Stella Harris, defending, if she was sure that the person she had seen in the CCTV image was the same woman she had dealings with in 2011, she said: ‘I am absolutely certain that is the same person.’

The trial was adjourned to tomorrow.

Sorry we are unable to accept comments for legal reasons.
