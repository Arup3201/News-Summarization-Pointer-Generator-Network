The Prime Minister said he would block Serbia and Albania from joining the EU unless there were stringent restrictions on how citizens could move across the continent

David Cameron threatened last night to veto any new members of the EU unless he won sweeping curbs on freedom of movement.

The Prime Minister said he would block Serbia and Albania from joining unless there were stringent restrictions on how citizens could move across the continent.

The poor Eastern European nations are next in line to join the union, and Turkey and  Bosnia could be next.

Mr Cameron said curbs were needed to avoid the ‘huge mistake’ of the unrestricted opening of borders to Poland and other countries nine years ago, with hundreds of thousands coming to the UK for work.

The threat, made after yesterday’s EU summit in Brussels, will put pressure on European leaders to increase restrictions on movement.

It could see Serbian and Albanian people denied free movement in Europe until their countries’ average earnings or GDP reached a certain level, for example.

Mr Cameron hopes it will also pave the way for a more general revision of EU treaties.

Days before restrictions on Romanian and Bulgarian migrants are lifted at the end of this month, he said: ‘The EU’s founding fathers simply did not envisage that the accession of new countries would trigger mass population movements across Europe.’

He added that free movement should not mean freedom to get ‘the best benefit deal’.

Both Serbia and Albania want to join the EU, but any negotiations will take at least ten years.

Unemployment in Albania is 13 per cent, and wages are low – meaning workers might find the UK job market attractive.

No new EU member can be admitted without the support of all existing members.

Mr Cameron said: ‘On new accessions, they are by unanimity so they don’t happen unless everybody agrees. So you do have a real opportunity . . . to insist on a different approach.’
