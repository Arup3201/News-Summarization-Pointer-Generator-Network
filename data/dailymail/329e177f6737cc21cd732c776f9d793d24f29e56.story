Spared: Shirley Garman has avoided prison after she left her 18-year-old disabled daughter at home while she went out drinking

This the mother who left her vulnerable, disabled daughter home alone while she went to a pub and got drunk.

Shirley Garman's daughter Jahdine was found by police distressed and was so agitated she kept falling over and had to be taken to hospital for treatment.

Guildford Crown Court heard officers became concerned about Jahdine after they were called to a disturbance at a pub in upmarket Oxshott, Surrey, which Garman was involved in, and wondered who was looking after her daughter.

They visited the house in Epsom, Surrey, and found Jahdine in a distressed state and agitated about an alarm on the cooker.

When Garman returned home, four hours later, she failed to recognise that the officers at her house were the same ones who had spoken to her at the pub.

Today, a judge decided not to send 40-year-old 
Garman prison after she admitted neglect so that she could receive 
treatment for her alcohol problems.

Prosecutor Jonathan Davies told the court the defendant had been the sole carer for her daughter, who despite being 18 years old, appeared and acted much younger.

'Jahdine was someone who had the appearance of a nine or 10-year-old girl and has a disorder present from birth - Russell Silver syndrome - which means she has poor growth, is shorter in height, has differences on the two sides of her body.

'She has epilepsy, encephalitis, and learning difficulties.

'She needed full-time care and should not be left alone for anything but a short time.'

He said police were called to the disturbance on May 6 last year and that the defendant was involved.

He said: 'The police officers who attended considered she had been drinking and she was displaying signs of that. They knew about Jahdine and were concerned if Shirley Garman was in the pub, where was Jahdine?

'They went to the home. Jahdine came to the door. She was agitated by an alarm in the flat - on the cooker. She said she didn’t know what to do about it.

'She repeatedly fell to the floor. She said she hadn’t eaten that day.'

Abandoned: The girl was left on her own at the house in Epsom, Surrey, while Shirley Garman went out drinking

While her daughter suffered back home, Garman was drinking at a pub in the upmarket village of Oxshott

The officers called for an ambulance and Jahdine was taken to hospital, before being cared for away from her mother. The teenager was found to have lost a lot of weight.

'A social worker said both the defendant and Jahdine appeared to have been in a state of decline,' said Mr Davies.

He added that on the day in question, Garman had requested a social worker to care for Jahdine while she went shopping.

Yet social services told her they had an understanding that her daughter could be left on her own for short periods of time.

'What in fact happened was Jahdine was left for a period of up to four hours,' said the prosecutor.

'She denied any neglect of her daughter. She said she didn’t want to be out for too long but she saw her friend outside the pub, spoke to him, and there was an argument.'

Shirley Garman's daughter Jahdine suffers from a rare disorder known as Russell Silver syndrome.

The disorder is a form of dwarfism which occurs in one in every 50,000 to 100,000 births.

The syndrome causes stunted growth, meaning sufferers are shorter than average and different sides of the body grow at different rates.

Those with the disorder can also have problems eating and processing food properly, meaning they end up with dangerously low levels of muscle or body fat.

Jahdine also suffered from epilepsy, which results in seizures, and encephalitis, an inflammation of the brain which can cause hallucinations and convulsions.

On November 11 last year, while on bail for the neglect, Garman was arrested again, for trying to steal a student’s phone.

She had been begging at Oxshott railway station with a man, again while drunk. She asked to use a phone belonging to a Miss Al-Fekaiki, but when she refused, Garman grabbed for it.

A nearby worker intervened and the victim made her escape, later reporting the matter to police. She was with officers looking for the man when she saw Garman going into a shop and pointed her out.

Garman said she had left her handbag on a train and needed to make a phone call and denied either begging or trying to steal the phone.

Judge Peter Moss later told her: 'I do not, for a second, accept your explanation'.

Speaking in mitigation for Garman, James Bloomer urged the judge not to jail his client as that would prevent her from receiving help in addressing her alcohol problem.

He also said that while the four-hour period was frightening for Jahdine, it should be seen in the context of alcoholism after years of appropriate care.

'There is a difference between a deterioration and turning to alcohol after 18 years worth of glowing, appropriate care for someone in a difficult situation,' he said.

The force used in the attempted phone theft was in a bid to get the phone and was not directed towards the victim, he added.

The court also heard that Garman had requested social workers to look after her daughter while she went shopping

Garman admitted neglect at Guildford Crown Court today and was told to deal with her alcohol problems

Judge Moss told Garman: 'I don’t think you were entirely truthful and I don’t think you have been entirely truthful since.

'I think you went to meet someone for a drink. You had a drink, and another drink.

'There was a disturbance and police were called and you were too drunk to realise the police knew you and Jahdine.

'You went round, turned up at your own house and didn’t recognise the same police officers.'

He acknowledged Garman had shown herself to be a loving, caring mother and he said he did not understand the reasons behind her turning to alcohol.

'The prosecution thought long and hard as to whether it was in the public interest to prosecute you at all. They did, and rightly so.'

He added: 'You are on a slippery slope and I think you have got a real problem with drink and temperament.'

He ordered Garman to be placed under a community order for two-and-a-half years, with an alcohol treatment requirement, and that she carry out 100 hours of unpaid work.

He also told her to pay Miss Al-Fekaiki £100 pounds in compensation.
