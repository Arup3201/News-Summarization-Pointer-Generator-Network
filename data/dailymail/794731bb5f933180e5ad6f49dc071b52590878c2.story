Voluntary policemen should be issued with Tasers, a senior officer said last night.

James Deller, a leading special constable, said he and other volunteers face the same risks as ordinary officers and need the same protection.

He said the 50,000-volt weapons were a highly effective deterrent against dangerous criminals who do not distinguish between specials and regular officers.

His comments came as the police watchdog said more officers than ever are armed with stun guns, which are being fired at record rates.

The Independent Police Complaints Commission warned the devices should not become the normal way of controlling violent suspects.

Mr Deller, an assistant chief officer for the Met in London, said specials already carried a baton, handcuffs and incapacitant spray. But he said Tasers can make a ‘dramatic difference’ and some specials are attached to teams where every other officer has one.

‘Specials face the same risks as their regular colleagues day in, day out. They may not do it all the time but the public do not distinguish between us,’ he added.

‘This is about equipping officers with the tools to do the job, as long as they are appropriately trained, appropriately selected and appropriately deployed.

‘It doesn’t matter that you only work four hours a week when you are staring at a man with a knife.’

Mr Deller, who has more than 20 years of experience, spoke out after Staffordshire Police decided against allowing trained specials to have Tasers. The force backed down from a proposed pilot scheme amid criticism from campaign groups and frontline police representatives.

The move would have been a considerable further expansion of the weapon’s use since it was introduced in Britain in 2003.

At first only firearms officers were handed Tasers but their availability has soared so that one in ten officers are trained to wield one.

Many forces have invested huge sums in the potentially deadly stun guns that are fired an average of five times a day across all forces. The number of confrontations involving Tasers more than doubled between 2009 and 2011, from 3,500 to 7,250.

Tasers operate by firing two metal barbs into a person, delivering a jolt of electricity that immobilises them by overcoming their central nervous system.

Yesterday, the IPCC said police must be able to justify the use of the weapons every time they are used. It called for clearer guidance on the use of Tasers on those in custody and vulnerable people, including children and those with mental illness.

Officials again highlighted concerns about the use of the weapons in ‘drive stun’ mode, in which they cause excruciating pain through direct contact with the skin. They found several cases in which the use of a Taser in this manner further inflamed a violent confrontation.

The watchdog continues to investigate three high-profile deaths in which Tasers may have played a part. These include that of Andrew Pimlott who suffered horrific injuries in a fireball after dousing himself in fuel in his Plymouth garden last year.

Cindy Butts, of the IPCC, said there were legitimate reasons for firing Tasers in the most difficult and challenging situations.

But she added that police forces must ensure they do not become a ‘default choice’, particularly when methods as simple as  talking to suspects could be equally effective.
