When Anya Hindmarch transformed her London Fashion Week catwalk-turned-conveyor-belt into supermarket sweep with dancing salesmen and household essentials emblazoned on to handbags, the fashion world could barely contain its excitement.

Anya's Georgiana clutches, 
made from soft chalk goatskin, carried logos from washing 
detergent packaging, cereal boxes, biscuit packets, and even Swan matches.

And it seems that having Tony The Tiger on your tote is the hottest trend for the coming season, because the entire collection has sold out and there's already a waiting list.

They're greeeeeat! Anya Hindmarch's AW14 accessories range, seen here for the first time at her AW14 show in London in February, is already sold out with a hefty waiting list

Good enough to eat (or smoke): The British designer's handbags have been emblazoned with Kellogg's cereals and even Swan matches packets

Despite many of the bags going on sale for more than £1,000 on Anya's website, there is a message under each of the totes that reads: 'Sorry, this item is currently out of stock, but if you join the waiting list we'll let you know as soon as it's back.'

A Rich Tea clutch is £895, while a Frosties maxi featherweight ebury will set you back £1,350.

Speaking about the coveted range at her AW14 show, Anya said: 'This collection began with the idea of finding beauty in the banal.

'The vivid "pop" graphics of a washing powder box or the guilty pleasure of the humble chocolate digestive.

'I wanted to treat the everyday ordinary in an extraordinary way.'

Join the queue: The entirety of Anya's range, including this £1,350 Frosties Maxi Featherweight Ebury, has sold out on the designer's website and has a waiting list

Breakfast chic: For AW14, Anya's Georgiana clutches, which were made from soft chalk goatskin, were hilariously inspired by cereal boxes

Speaking about her dramatic show, which had front row regulars Poppy Delevingne and Olivia Palermo in fits of giggles, Anya said: 'The supermarket conveyor belts are a playful take on those small unforeseen events that can change your life: a sliding doors moment and the luck of a chance encounter, passing someone in the airport for a moment or a door opening to reveal the unexpected.

'It's about celebrating the small things and seizing the moment to "get happy",' she said.

Fashion writer Simon Glazin said: 'Nostalgia is officially in! And it's not just 90's fashion that's back and enjoying another resurgence, it's iconic household packaging too.

'Anya Hindmarch seriously knows how to grab the nation's heart and attention. This collection of bags, with their nod to 90's cereal and washing powder boxes, resonates with at least three generations, hence why Anya is now a sell out.

'You find yourself saying: "Ahhh, I remember that!" We all love Tony the Tiger, the Corn Flakes rooster is a bird that will forever be remembered, the yellow of the Coco Pops box brings back childhood sugar rush memories and who doesn't feel like they can eat a whole packet of Ginger Nuts? The fact that Anya has rendered all of these in leather is pure genius.

'Talk about capturing the zeitgeist! Who ever thought cereal could be so chic? Certainly not Kellogg's! To take something so "everyday" and turn it into fashion is a hard feat to pull off, and even though these bags are still uber novelty, Anya has managed to do it. And sell out too.'

That's handy! Peckish this afternoon? No worries, just grab a biscuit from your bag

Hindmarch's career began at the age of 18 when she was studying in Florence, Italy.

Noting that drawstring leather duffles were popular, she borrowed £600 to import some to England and quickly sold 500, with a little help from Harper's Bazaar - then called Harpers & Queen.

A year later she had opened her first shop in Hackney. Fast-forward 25 years, and Anya now runs 60 shops in 17 countries and counts the likes of Keira Knightley, Scarlett Johansson, Sienna Miller, Madonna and the late Margaret Thatcher as fans.

Sorry, Cara. It looks like your new Mulberry totes have been knocked off the season's most coveted list.

Royal seal of approval: Even the Duchess of Cambridge is a fan of Anya's totes and carried the fan clutch at Wimbledon last fortnight, left, and is often spotted with her trusty Bespoke Maud clutch, £450, right

What a show! The Delevingne sisters - Chloe and Poppy - looked delighted as they watched the finale unfold
