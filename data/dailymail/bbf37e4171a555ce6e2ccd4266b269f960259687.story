Labour has accepted hundreds of thousands of pounds from a giant accountancy firm which the party's own MPs have accused  of promoting tax avoidance schemes on an 'industrial scale'.

PricewaterhouseCoopers donated £386,605 to Ed Miliband's party last year, new figures published by the electoral commission revealed this morning.

The revelation is a major embarrassment for Mr Miliband after he spent last week attacking David Cameron for turning a blind-eye to tax avoidance.

Ed Miliband's Labour Party accepted £386,605 in donations from the accountancy firm PricewaterhouseCoopers last year

Margaret Hodge, the Labour chair of the Commons Public Accounts Committee, has previously criticised the party for accepting donations from the accountancy firm.

She said: 'The Conservatives took money from PricewaterhouseCoopers (PwC) when they were in opposition, the Labour Party does and probably the Liberal Democrats too. I think that's inappropriate, I wouldn't do it.'

Her comments came after her committee – which acts as the Commons' spending watchdog – issued a blistering report condemning the way that PwC devised 'complex strategies and contrived structures' to help big companies dramatically reduce their tax bills.

A spokesman for PwC told MailOnline it did not make cash donations to any political party. He said: 'The figure published by the Electoral Commission relates to the secondment of junior members of staff to provide limited and fully disclosed technical support (such as research and analysis).'

Once trade union cash is stripped away, PwC's donation was the fourth biggest donation to all political parties in 2014.

The three biggest donations in the last three months of 2014 were all from trade unions to Labour, with Unison handing over £1,384,289 to Mr Miliband's party, Unite donating £1,336,570 and GMB £1,088,810.

The Union of Shop, Distributive and Allied Workers also gave £416,872 to Labour.

The Tories reported more than £1 million more in donations than Labour in the final three months of 2014

The Tories' largest donation was £500,000 from Michael D Gooley, while Lord Michael Glendonbrook gave £334,000 and David J Rowland donated £322,700.

The Lib Dems received £400,000 from Max Batley while Ukip received £394,254 from Rock Services Limited.

The Tories reported more than £1 million more in donations than Labour in the final three months of 2014 as the parties sought to boost their election war chests.

The Conservatives reported donations totalling £8,345,687 while Labour reported £7,163,988, the Electoral Commission figures showed.

The Liberal Democrats reported £3,038,500 in donations, Ukip £1,505,055 and the Green Party £248,520.

The latest regular release of donation information comes amid a bitter political row between Labour and the Tories over the tax affairs of party supporters.

MPs have accused PwC of promoting tax avoidance schemes on an 'industrial scale'

Mr Miliband accused the Tory leader of being a 'dodgy Prime Minister surrounded by dodgy donors'.

The total donations reported by political parties between October 1 and December 31 2014 was £20,326,862, more than £5 million higher than the previous three month period.

The total is also higher than the £17,419,277 recorded in the final quarter in 2009 when parties were preparing to fight the 2010 general election.

Ed Balls, Chuka Umunna and Tristram Hunt are among those who have accepted help from PwC staff - worth tens of thousands of pounds each.

The revelation is particularly damaging because PwC has placed its staff in Labour teams drawing up official policies on economic issues, including tax.

In a statement released last month, PwC said that it had provided staff to work in Parliament who provided 'limited and fully disclosed technical support' to the main political parties on areas in which the firm had particular expertise or knowledge of the business environment.

A total of 11 Labour MPs have had a member of the company working in their Westminster offices in the last year.

Ed Balls, the shadow chancellor, has had two members of staff from the accountancy firm working with him, worth the equivalent of £64,162.

PwC has also been eager to forge strong links with Chukka Umunna, the shadow business secretary. On three separate occasions he lists having had PwC research assistants working in his office, a perk worth a staggering £99,550.

Shaban Mahmood, Cathy Jamieson, Catherine McKinnell all received a 'technical support analyst' to help with their role as shadow treasury minister, worth £57,078.

Tristram Hunt, the shadow education secretary, also had a research assistant for six months at a value of £74,655, the equivalent of £149,310-a-year salary, and nearly £7,000 more than the Prime Minister is paid.

The shadow work and pensions secretary, Rachel Reeves, also has a £63,045 PwC analyst to help in her office right up until the next General Election.

Jim Murphy, the recently elected leader of the Scottish Labour Party, was given a £29,435 research assistant by the company while he was the shadow secretary for international development.

Tessa Jowell, who is standing down at the next election, had the help of two PwC staff costing the company £81,970. She states in the register that the staff worked part-time and were shared with another MP, although does not say who.

The Edinburgh South backbencher, Ian Murray, has a £45,000 PwC employee on secondment until May. John Healey, the former shadow health minister, also had a research officer at a cost of £32,670 to help him work on housing and housing benefit policy.

In total it gave 4,827 hours of support to political parties in 2013. Last year, it used it staff to provide 4,493 to Labour MPs and 1,511 hours to Liberal Democrats.

Labour defended the arrangements, saying that PwC had provided long-standing support to all three main political parties on a non-party basis.

'Given the complexity of government and that opposition parties do not have significant access to civil servants, the support provided by organisations such as these helps ensure that there is better scrutiny of Government policy,' a spokesman said.

'Where organisations provide staff to support research and analysis for opposition parties it is right that these are declared – as currently happens – in the Register of Members' Interests.'

PwC said in a statement: 'PwC has no political affiliation. Our people provide limited and fully disclosed technical support to the main political parties in areas where our expertise and knowledge of the business environment can help them better understand technical matters and the consequences of their policy proposals. We do not develop policy on their behalf.'
