House Speaker John Boehner already has the right tan for Florida's beaches, but he insists he's not headed south to retire any time soon.

The Ohio Republican laughed off the idea on Wednesday when a scrum of reporters cornered him in the speaker's lobby hear the House floor, chuckling 'Ha, ha, ha.'

Minutes later, he told The Washington Post that rumors suggesting he's readying his political swansong are 'absolutely not true.'

Speculation in Washington has run rampant since news broke a week ago that Boehner and his wife had purchased an $835,000 luxury condominium in the posh Florida community of Marco Island.

'Ha, ha, ha': Boehner laughed off the idea that he won't be back as speaker next year, disappointing some tea partiers who would rather see one of their own in charge

Marco Island, Florida is a luxury community with water as far as the eye can see -- and real estate prices that rival Manhattan

He plunked down $185,000 as a down payment and took out a $650,000 mortgage for the rest, according to public records.

But his Ohio fundraisers are still racking up record numbers, a Boehner campaign aide told MailOnline, and he's planning to campaign as hard has ever – much to the dismay of some conservatives who see him as too soft.

Nationally, the speaker raked in $54 million for Republicans last year, which he distributed to incumbents, insurgent challengers, state parties and political committees at the state and national level.

He filed for reelection in Ohio's Eighth Congressional District on December 9. The aide said that phone banks, neighborhood canvassing and other volunteer efforts have been underway for several weeks.

And this month Boehner's campaign held a telephone town hall meeting for voters in his district, who first sent him to Congress in 1990.

His Capitol Hill spokesman Michael Steel has also tried to downplay the significance of the condo purchase.

'This area of Florida has been the Boehners' family vacation spot for many years, and rather than continue to put money into vacation rentals year after year, they decided to buy a condo,' he said in a statement.

'Their home is in West Chester, Ohio, and will continue to be.'

The always-tan Boehner is known for his teary emotional moments but had only chuckles when the subject of his retirement came up

Boehner, 64, has become more of a polarizing figure than most observers expected him to be when he took the speaker's gavel in 2011.

He has tussled with tea partiers and other conservatives in his caucus over Obamacare, federal budget items, immigration, and last year's ill-fated partial government shutdown.

But the perennially orange-hued Ohioan appears to be in Washington for the long haul, occupying a basement apartment in the District that he rents – in you-can't-make-this-up fashion – from a tanning lobbyist.

The pricey Florida condo now in the Boehner family is in a 14-story building surrounded by beachfront property. The 2,093-square-foot home includes three bedrooms, three bathrooms and an open-floor plan whose balcony offers uninterrupted views of evening sunsets, according to Realty Today.

It also features a master suite with a large walk-in shower and a whirlpool tub.

One Marco Island realtor's website describes kitchens in the building, called The Tampico, as 'smartly equipped with Poggenpohl cabinetry, Corian countertops and full General Electric Monogram Series appliance package, sure to delight the chef in the family.'

The location itself includes some condos with price tags as high as $2.2 million, they add, and rises 'over the sugar-white shores of the Gulf of Mexico, offering spectacular gulf and island views from gracious terraces.'
