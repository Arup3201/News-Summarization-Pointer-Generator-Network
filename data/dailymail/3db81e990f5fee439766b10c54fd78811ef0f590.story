Ireland's prime minister has revealed he has been sent letters written in blood and branded a murderer by opponents of his government's plans to allow limited access to abortion.

Enda Kenny's government agreed draft legislation in April to allow for limited access to abortion where a woman's life is in danger, including the threat of suicide.

It follows months of protests from both sides of the debate on an issue that has polarised the country for decades.

Abused: Irish Prime Minister Enda Kenny hopes to enact legislation on abortion before parliament adjourns in July

After some 40,000 people massed outside government offices in Dublin on Saturday in the largest anti-abortion demonstration in traditionally Roman Catholic Ireland's history, Kenny delivered a trenchant defence of the government's plans.

'I am now being branded by personnel around the country as being a murderer, that I am going to have on my soul the death of 20 million babies,' Kenny told parliament on Wednesday, detailing how he had been sent items of Catholic regalia and threatening messages.

'I'm getting medals, scapulars, plastic foetuses, letters written in blood, telephone calls all over the system and it's not confined to me.'

A two-decade debate over how Ireland should deal with a Supreme Court ruling that abortion be permitted when a woman's life was in danger was re-opened last year after the death of a woman who was denied an abortion of her dying foetus.

Pro-Life Campaigners gathered in Merrion Square, Dublin, as Ireland prepares to legislate and introduce regulations to allow abortion if there is a real and substantial risk to a woman's life, including the threat of suicide

The tragedy of Indian dentist Savita Halappanavar, who 
died in October last year after being refused an abortion at an Irish hospital, shook the country and stirred up debate on the issue of abortion.

Her inquest was held in April and following it Mrs Halappanavar's husband  hit out 
at her 'horrendous, barbaric and inhuman' treatment she received.

The jury ruled that Mrs Halappanavar's death was by medical misadventure, and set out a string of 
recommendations to prevent a repeat of the tragedy.

Speaking
after the hearing, her widower Praveen said that University Hospital 
Galway had left her to die, and did nothing to help her until after she 
had miscarried their baby.

'It was too late,' he said on the 
couple's fifth wedding anniversary. 'The care she received was in no way
different to staying at home.'

Mr Halappanavar says he is 
considering further action through the European courts, arguing that the
hospital breached his wife's right to life. Mrs Halappanavar, 31, was 17 weeks 
pregnant when admitted to University Hospital Galway on October 21 last 
year with an inevitable miscarriage.Â  She died a week later after suffering a septic blood infection.

Successive governments had sidestepped
acting on the ruling, the result of a challenge by a 14-year-old rape 
victim in the so-called 'X-case' of 1992 to a constitutional amendment 
nine years earlier that intended to ban abortion in all instances.

Kenny
hopes to enact legislation before parliament adjourns in July despite 
misgivings among some among his conservative Fine Gael party and a 
concerted campaign by the Ireland's once powerful Catholic Church to put
pressure on lawmakers.

In a strongly worded statement on Tuesday, the Catholic Bishops of Ireland accused the government of misleading people on the abortion legislation and said every citizen 'should be deeply concerned' by the radical changes proposed.

Rocked by a series of child abuse scandals, the church's influence over society has waned since the 1980s and a younger, secular generation wants to end the practice of Irish women travelling to nearby Britain to terminate their pregnancies.

Kenny, a regular mass goer who delivered a once-unthinkable rebuke to the Vatican over its handling of the scandals two years ago, said he did not agree with many of the statements that the bishops had made.

'My job as taoiseach (prime minister) is to lead the government in governing for the people of the country. That is not confined to any sector of the people, it is for all of the people,' he said to applause from some members of parliament.

'Therefore I am proud to stand here as a public representative, as a taoiseach who happens to be a Catholic but not a Catholic taoiseach.'
