A dentist is facing up to five years in jail after she admitted sending a text message at the wheel as she knocked down and killed a dog-walker.

Kay Nolan, 45, had pulled over in a lay-by to compose the message on her mobile phone but had set off again by the time she pressed ‘send’.

As she did so, she ploughed into Stuart Mather, 60, a grandfather who was walking his Scottish terrier, Hamish.

Both Mr Mather and his dog were then hit again by the car behind Nolan.

Mr Mather was taken by air ambulance to hospital but died later. His dog also perished.

Nolan, who works as a dentist at a 
practice near Burnley, had been facing a charge of causing death by 
dangerous driving – which carries a maximum 14-year prison sentence.

But on the day she was due to stand 
trial by jury, lawyers allowed her to plead guilty to the lesser charge 
of causing death by careless or inconsiderate driving.

The charge carries a minimum sentence of 15 months and a maximum of five years.

Last night the family of the victim were too upset to speak about the tragedy.

'It sends out the wrong message that taking and destroying lives on roads is treated leniently'

But Richard Coteau, of road safety 
charity Brake, said: ‘Brake believes it is inappropriate to prosecute 
someone whose bad driving has killed or seriously injured for “careless”
driving, because if you have killed or maimed through your bad driving,
your actions were by definition dangerous.

‘Brake is very concerned that fewer 
and fewer road death cases are being prosecuted under the charge of 
causing death by dangerous driving.

‘This means that in many cases people 
who kill through their bad driving are receiving unduly low sentences 
that do not reflect the harm they have caused, do not act as a deterrent
and send out the wrong message that taking and destroying lives on 
roads is treated leniently.’

The tragedy occurred at 5.20pm on June
6, 2011, as Nolan was on her way home to the village of 
Thornton-in-Craven near Skipton, North Yorkshire.

Mr Mather, a Campaign for Real Ale 
member who had two sons and three grandchildren, was taking Hamish for 
his regular walk. Nolan, in her silver Honda Jazz car, pushed the button
to send her text message as she drove down the road. Police said her 
car then hit Mr Mather and his dog, who were both then hit again by a 
Vauxhall Astra travelling behind.

No one in either car was injured but 
Mr Mather suffered horrendous injuries and despite the efforts of medics
at Royal Blackburn Hospital, he later died.

Nolan was charged last January with 
death by dangerous driving but Robert Elias, prosecuting, told Preston 
Crown Court on Monday that the Crown Prosecution Service had decided to 
accept her guilty plea to the lesser charge after discussions with Mr 
Mather’s family.

Nolan, who has no previous convictions, will be sentenced on December 17.

An earlier version of this story incorrectly stated that Stuart Mather was hit by a car that was being driven by Kay Nolan as she was sending a text message. It also incorrectly stated that Miss Nolan was pulling out of a layby in Higham when in fact it was Padiham. And also that Miss Nolan had a collision with a Vauxhall Astra. Nor did Miss Nolan send a text seconds after the collision with Mr Mather.
