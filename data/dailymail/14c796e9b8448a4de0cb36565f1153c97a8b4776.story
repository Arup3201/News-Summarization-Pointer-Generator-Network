A father has gone on trial for allegedly beating and starving his three-year-old daughter to death - three years after her bruised, malnourished body was found at his home.

Donald Lee Cockrell, 30, has pleaded not guilty to murdering Alexis Marie Pounder with his fiancee, Michelle Nicole Smith, in Sandy, Oregon in January 2010.

Smith pleaded guilty to the killing last year and faces a minimum of 30 years behind bars, and as part of the plea deal she will testify against Cockrell.

Alexis, who was known as Lexi, weighed 
just 21 pounds when paramedics found her beaten body at the 
garbage-filled home she shared with Cockrell, Smith and four other 
children under five.

Investigators said it was one of the worst cases they have ever seen.

The young girl, who had lived at the home since October 2009, was incontinent and was repeatedly punished for soiling herself,Â The Oregonian reported.

If
 the family went out to a fast-food restaurant, she was the only one who
 would go without a meal, and would be forced to sleep on the floor or 
to run as punishment, the paper reported.

An autopsy found that she suffered a blunt force head trauma and the report detailed scores of injuries to her little body, prosecutor Christine Landers told the jury in Cockrell's trial.

When a detective asked Cockrell what had happened to his daughter, he simply said: 'I woke 
up and found my daughter dead', Landers said.

Innocent: She was allegedly punished as she suffered from incontinence and would soil herself

Lexi was not the only child who suffered abuse at the rural home.

Her sister Kara was also forced to scavenge the dirty kitchen floor and garbage for food, and was forced to sleep in a tiny space between the wall and a couch from which she could not escape.

The girls lived with Cockrell and his fiancee, who also had two children of 
her own who lived at the home. The couple also had a child together.

At the start of the trial on 
Wednesday, the jurors were shown pictures of Lexi as a smiling child and
 also photographs of her bruised, lifeless body.

Cockrell is charged with aggravated murder, murder by abuse and criminal mistreatment related to the death.

Loss: The family would allegedly make her sleep on the floor or make her run as a punishment

In danger: The young girl and her sister had gone to live with Cockrell and his fiancee in October 2009

The trial is expected to last six weeks. Among the witnesses called to the stand will be the paramedics who answered the 911 call and Smith's parents, who lived in an apartment above the couple's.

Defense attorney Jenny Cooke said Lexi was not killed by the abuse. Instead, she said the girl became ill and suffered from pneumonia.

She claimed that the bruises were caused by typical childhood accidents or by one of the other children, and that Lexi's weight loss had not been obvious to Smith.

Cooke added that the only evidence that Cockrell hit his daughter came from Smith's claims.

The defense will portray Smith as an 
unreliable witness addicted to painkillers who struck up a deal to 
avoid a possible death sentence, The Oregonian noted.

After the death, the state Department of Human Services took temporary custody of the surviving children and they are reportedly now living with relatives.

Heather Pounder, Lexi's biological mother, said her daughters had been staying with Cockrell and Smith since the October before her death, and said Cockrell rarely let her see the child.

The last time she saw her was nearly four weeks before her death.

'There's really no words to explain what it's like for me,' she said after the arraignment. 'I try to find the words and I can't - my worst nightmare.'
