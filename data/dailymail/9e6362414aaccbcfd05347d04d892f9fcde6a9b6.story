This is the dramatic moment that three children were pulled out of a sinking 4x4 caught in floodwater seconds before it went under.

Rescuers jumped into the water when the vehicle became trapped under a railway bridge after more than a month’s worth of rain fell in a few hours.

Scott Swinford, 30, was in the Mitsubishi Pajero with his  eight-year-old son Reece, niece Jessica Dobinson, six, and nephew Alfie Dobinson, four, when they became stuck.

Video shot by an onlooker showed local
people including Hannah King, 21, Emma Burles, 26, and Jordan McNulty, 
21, wading into the 6ft deep water and forming a human chain to rescue 
them.

Miss King said: ‘We 
saw the car being swept along by the floodwater and three children in 
the back. The car was smoking and we could see it was sinking.

‘When
we saw children were trapped we didn’t think twice, we just jumped in 
the water and started swimming towards the car. I’m 5ft 2in and I 
couldn’t touch the floor it was so deep.

'When we got to the car the 
water was already up to the children’s legs. The little girl was 
panicking because she couldn’t get her seatbelt undone and the water was
rising really quickly.

‘We couldn’t open the doors because of the water pressure so we helped them climb out the windows one by one.

Against the clock: A little girl is pulled from the 4x4 as the water continues to rise at an alarmingly fast rate

Brave: The women managed to get the little girl out of the car which was caught in deep flood water

All out: The third child is pulled out of the car window by Miss Young as other residents take his brother and sister to safety

‘Once the children were safe we helped the father get out. Within a minute the car went under.’

Mr
Swinford, from Southend, Essex, was returning from a shopping trip when
his vehicle got stuck in nearby Hockley around 5pm on Saturday 
following dowpours.

‘I 
didn’t think anything of it at first as my car is like a mini- monster 
truck and we’d already gone through a lot of floodwater that day,’ he 
said.

‘Within seconds I knew this was different but by then it was too 
late.

‘I put it in reverse 
but the current just dragged the car in and it began sinking. I opened 
the windows as far as I could before the engine cut out to give the 
children an escape route.

‘The water was coming in through the floor and then over the windows as we sank further. We got out just in time.’

After the rescue, another local resident invited the family into her home and gave the children a bath and warm clothing.

Helping hand: Both women hold on to the car as the children's father gets ready to climb out

All safe: The shocked father splashes into the water and abandons his sinking 4x4

Lucky escape: Less than a minute after all the family escape the 4x4 it becomes completely submerged underneath the flood water

The
dramatic incident came as downpours blighted the start of the Bank 
Holiday for many, with up to 50mm of rain falling in parts of Essex in 
only six hours.

But today the whole country is expected to be bathed in sunshine with temperatures nudging 27C (81F).

Simon
Partridge, a Met Office forecaster, said: ‘Most people should see a dry
day with some good sunny spells.

There’s the chance of the odd shower 
in the South-West. We could see temperatures of up to 27C in the South 
and South-East. In Manchester it will be around 21C (70F) or 22C (72F).’

The
torrential weekend rain caused muddy conditions for music fans at the 
Leeds Festival and wellies and ponchos were also the order of the day at
the Reading Festival.

There
were fears that the start of the Notting Hill Carnival yesterday would 
be hit by rain, but the skies cleared for performers to parade through 
the streets of West London in bright costumes.
