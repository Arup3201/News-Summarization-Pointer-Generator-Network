The family of a man killed over a $300 pair of Beats By Dr Dre headphones in Philadelphia have revealed that they can’t afford to bury him.

The body of Christian Massey, 21-year-old, is still at the Hospital of the University of Pennsylvania, where he was pronounced dead on Saturday evening.

The family held a vigil in Massey's honor on Monday night, but it will cost more than they can afford to give Massey a proper burial, according to the family.

Christian Massey was shot five times on Saturday as he ran from a mugger who had demanded his new pair of Beats By Dr Dre headphones, Massey had just upgraded his old pair (pictured) the day before

Tragic: Massey refused to give up his headphones and instead fled down this alleyway where his assailant shot him in the back five times - before the eyes of a group of children playing yards away

‘We can't get [Christian] out of the morgue right now,’ Thelma Hodge, Massey's aunt, told Philly.com.

‘We were told it would cost between $2,200 and $2,700, according to one funeral home. It's really been a mess. Everyone is trying to deal with this and it's killing us all. Neighbors won't cooperate [with police]. And now this. 

‘Christian was a good kid, a great kid, who wouldn't harm anyone. He's the kind of kid who would do anything for you.’

Massey was walking to a friend's house when a mugger stopped him and demanded he hand over the brand-new $300 headphones, in the Winfield area of Philadelphia.

Massey, a special needs former high school athlete, was described by friends and family alike as a 'gentle giant'

But Massey refused and ran down an alleyway where his assailant shot him in the back five times – in front of a group of children playing yards away.

The unknown attacker then fled the scene empty handed, leaving the headphones, which Massey had only bought on Friday, lying in the road a few inches from his body.

'To me, he was my child,' Eula Hodge, his grandmother, told NBC Philadelphia. 'Why did they have to shoot him. They didn't get what they shot him for so he was shot for nothing.'

At 6 feet, 2 inches tall and weighing 305 pounds, Massey was described by those who knew him as a gentle giant.

In foster care for most of his teenage years, Massey attended Marple Newtown High School where he spent time in a program for special 
needs students before graduating in June. He had planned to enroll in a 
postgraduate construction program.

Iconic: Famed for their iconic red 'b' logo, the Beats By Dr Dre premium headphones helped to make Dr Dre (pictured) the world's highest earning musician last year

Famed for their iconic red 'b' logo, 
Dr Dre's Beats By Dr Dre premium headphones have become a must-have 
accessory for America's youth since their launch in 2006.

Dr
Dre has relied on endorsement by popular musicians, including will.i.am. and P Diddy, as well as sport stars  to help sell his 
pricey earphones.

Priced between 
$150 and $400, they made Dr Dre the world's highest earning musician 
last year with a reported revenue of $110 million.

He was also a former high school athlete who had played football and basketball at Marple Newtown High.

Dennis Reardon, assistant principal and athletic director at the school is attempting to raise the funds.

‘Our Home and School Association is trying to do what they can do. It's still been very tough around here,’ said Reardon.

‘Everyone still has a very hollow feeling at the school. People are having a hard time trying to understand why something like this happened.’

Murder detectives have launched an investigation into the senseless killing but, with no leads, are appealing for witnesses to come forward.

Massey's cousin, Pebble Hill, echoed her aunt's sentiment that residents of the neighborhood where the young man was slain have been uncooperative in helping to track down his killer.

'My cousin was a beautiful person. He was like a brother to me, and right now, my family can use all the support they can get,' she said. "This has been a great strain on our family emotionally, financially. We love all the outpouring that my family's received.'

Massey’s Facebook page features several photos of him wearing an older pair of Beats headphones which he had traded in for the newer model on Friday.
