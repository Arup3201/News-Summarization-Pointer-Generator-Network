Judging by these pictures he's none too happy about it, but Britain's fattest cat now has his own personal trainer.

Ulric, who weighs 2st 2lbs, is getting back into shape with the help of a puppy. 

The Norwegian Forest cat - who at a staggering 2st 2lbs is twice the weight of a normal feline - has been on a diet since last year but barely lost a pound.

Now his desperate owner Jan Mitchell has bought a five-month old puppy to help him flight the flab.

Dennis, a pugalier (a pug crossed with a King Charles cavalier spaniel) has got Ulric running and play fighting in a bid to fight the flab after dieting failed.

And in three months of forced exercise, the tubby tomcat has already lost 2lbs - more than he lost in 16 months of dieting.

Jan, 69, from Dorchester, Dorset, said:  'We wanted to get a puppy in the hope he would play with Ulric but Dennis has turned out to be a bit of a personal trainer for him.

'They get on really well and Ulric now runs around the garden, which he never went in before. Although, he doesn't really have much choice when Dennis is chasing him.

The new doggy trainer seems to be doing the trick as in three months of forced exercise, Ulric has already lost 2lbs - more than he lost in 16 months of dieting

'They play fight and wrestle on the ground quite a lot which must be doing Ulric some good. Ulric is a lot more active than he's ever been and is starting to lose weight.'

Ulric was a normal-size kitten when Jan got him and his sister Ulla at three months old, but his lazy nature and his habit of stealing his sister's food meant by 15 months old he was 1st 3lbs.

When he hit two stone - more than twice the average weight of a healthy cat - Jan entered him in a pet slimming competition run by animal charity PDSA.

Ulric was the heaviest cat ever to take part in the competition and had his food weighed to make sure he didn't overeat, but after the six-month competition he'd barely lost a pound.

Jan, a retired secretary, said: 'We couldn't really work out why Ulric got so fat - his diet only consisted of dry cat food and water, nothing elaborate.

'He just kept getting bigger and bigger and when he hit two stone that's when the alarm bells started ringing.

'He is a lovely cat but he's just very greedy and lazy. He didn't do any exercise and spent all day lying around. I tried putting him on a lead and take him for a walk but he refused to move.

'Dennis absolutely loves him and can't leave him alone.

'Ulric is still on a diet but now he is getting more exercise hopefully he should lose a lot more weight.' 

The seven-year-old Norwegian Forest cat was declared as morbidly obese by vets when he ballooned to twice his normal weight after he spent years stealing his sister Ulla's food and gorging on cat biscuits.

He is only a few pounds off what is thought to be the world's heaviest cat, the aptly named Meatball from the US, who weighs in at a whopping two-and-a-half stone.

The four-year-old puss was handed over to Maricopa County Animal Care and Control in Phoenix, Arizona, by his former owners. Previous fattest cat, Meow - also from the US - died at 2st 11lbin 2012.   

Ulric had even been entered into a pet slimming competition, run by animal charity PDSA, to help him lose weight but nothing seemed to work until Dennis the puppy arrived
