Brazil legend Romario has backed Barcelona striker Neymar to break the country's long-standing goalscoring record currently held by Pele.

Neymar is already the fifth highest scorer in Brazil's history with 42 goals in 60 caps behind only Pele (77), Ronaldo (62), Romario (55) and Zico (48).

But the Barcelona forward is still only 23 years of age, and Romario thinks he will one day break the great Pele's record.

Romario thinks the 23-year-old is capable of surpassing Pele's all-time goalscoring record

Romario told Folha de Sao Paulo: 'I think because of his age, though he still has others to topple, Neymar will become top goalscorer in Brazil's history, surpassing Pele.

'It wouldn't hurt if Neymar leapfrogged me in the list. I left my mark on history and now it's his turn.'

Romario played 70 times for Brazil during his long playing career and was part of the team that won the 1994 World Cup in the United States.
