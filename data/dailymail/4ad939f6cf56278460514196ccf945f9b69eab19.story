Tim Cook, chief operating officer of Apple Inc, is expected to launch the iPhone 5 on October 4

Al Gore, a board member of Apple Computer, seemed to give the biggest hint yet of what the tech giant had in store for us in October - referring to 'the new iPhones released next month.'

This seemed to confirm two rumours: one, that there would be more than one model, and two, that they would both appear late next month. Mr Gore's statements - at a conference in South Africa - also tied in closely with the most credible of the recent iPhone rumours.

AllThingsDigital said Apple is 
expected to hold its next big media event on October 4, when it is 
expected to launch the iPhone 5.

Apple plans to make the new device available for purchase within a few weeks of the launch, sources added. As usual, the company declined to  comment.

While the iPhone 5 is much anticipated, there is more at stake than usual.

This is because, since legendary 
outgoing CEO and co-founder Steve Jobs announced his departure, it will be newly installed CEO Tim Cook’s first big product 
introduction, and the place where the public will get a first lengthy 
impression of him.

People have wondered whether Apple can continue to compete without its creative driving force - especially as rivals such as Samsung continue to gain ground on the tech giant.

Could Al Gore have revealed not one, but two big secrets about Apple - a company of which he is a board member?

Ever since Apple launched its iPhone, it's been an open secret that Samsung makes many of the components inside it - in fact Samsung's CEO has admitted, 'Apple is our biggest customer.'

But ever since Samsung launched its own Galaxy series of phones and tablets - high-powered touchscreens whose flagship, the Galaxy S II, currently outpaces iPhone on the processing front - legal war has erupted between the companies in nine countries.

This week, a Samsung source revealed Samsung was considering legal action to ban Apple's upcoming iPhone 5 in Europe - after an executive admitted a similar move in Samsung's native Korea was planned.

Too similar? Samsung's Galaxy touschscreens and iPhone are the subject of a bitter legal dispute in several countries

A Samsung executive told the Korea 
Times this week, 'When the iPhone 5 arrives here, Samsung plans to take Apple to 
court here for its violation of Samsung's wireless technology related 
patents.'

This is in 
response to Apple's continued legal action against Samsung's Galaxy 
family of touchscreen tablets and smartphones - some of which are 
currently illegal in Europe, thanks to Apple lawsuits claiming they are 'slavish' copies of iPhone and iPad.

Samsung recently overtook Nokia in 
the smartphone market, and its Galaxy S II offers a larger screen and 
faster processor than iPhone 4 - and has been a huge hit among geeky smartphone connoisseurs.

This month, Apple even forced Samsung to withdraw a prototype tablet device from the show floor of a Berlin electronics show. Samsung's larger Galaxy 10.1 tablet remains illegal in Europe thanks to Apple's legal action.

The Maeil Business Newspaper reported that the South Korean firm may seek an injunction against Apple's new iPhone in Europe. Samsung said it would not comment on ongoing legal issues.

The two technology firms have been locked in intensifying legal battles in nine countries over their flagship smartphone and tablet products - battles made more complex by the fact that many related patents are held by other internet giants such as Google and Microsoft.

The latest attacks come after Apple successfully blocked Samsung from selling its latest tablets in Germany and some smartphone models in the Netherlands and forced its rival to delay launching new tablets in Australia.

After Apple's latest legal victory in Germany earlier this month, Samsung said it would take all available legal options.

Apple first sued Samsung in April, claiming its strongest competitor had 'slavishly' copied its product designs, and Samsung had since counter-sued, arguing Apple infringed on its mobile technologies.
