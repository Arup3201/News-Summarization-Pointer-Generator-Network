A mayor is in line for an 80 per cent pay rise, in a move which could trigger a fresh wave of spiralling local government salary increases.

Despite his council making £70million of cuts, Sir Peter Soulsby could see his pay go up from £56,000 to £100,000.

The Government has pleaded with councils to cut the pay of their best-rewarded officials at a time of austerity. But under the proposals, Sir Peter’s deputy could more than double his salary from £34,000 to £75,000.

Former Labour MP Sir Peter Soulsby, seen here with his wife Alison,  was elected mayor of Leicester this year. The council is pushing through £70million spending curbs and shedding 1,000 jobs this winter

But a £100,000 salary would make Sir Peter the second highest-paid elected mayor in the country, behind only Boris Johnson (pictured), who is on £144,000

Six assistant mayors would pocket 65 per
 cent increases from £26,000 to £40,000, and all 47 city councillors 
would see their basic allowances go up 20 per cent from £10,000 to 
£12,000.

Former Labour MP Sir Peter was elected 
Mayor of Leicester this year. The council is pushing through £70million 
spending curbs and shedding 1,000 jobs this winter.

Sir Peter last month described the cuts 
as ‘enormously problematic’ and added that he was ‘determined to 
minimise the pain on front-line services and, so far as I can, protect 
the jobs of the people who provide the services’.

But a £100,000 salary would make him the
 second highest-paid elected mayor in the country, behind only Boris 
Johnson, who is on £144,000.

If the pay rises go through, they are 
likely to have an immediate knock-on effect across the country. Local 
authorities tend to set elected members’ pay and allowance rates by 
comparing themselves with their neighbours.

Some councils have doubled the level of 
allowances paid to elected members in the past five years by claiming 
they were falling behind.

The increases in Leicester were proposed by a four-strong remuneration panel. Sir Peter has said that the panel is independent, but the city’s one Tory councillor, Ross Grant, said it had been appointed after Labour won all but two council seats in May elections, and called it ‘hand-picked’.

He said: ‘The pay proposals are disgraceful. The panel has been promoted as independent, but its members were appointed by Labour after the election, with no involvement for opposition parties.

‘It has a representative of business, which needs to keep sweet with the council, and of a university, which needs co-operation with the council to get its expansion plans approved.’

Local Government Minister Bob Neill said: ‘True to form this shows you can’t trust Labour councils with public money. It’s scandalous that they are lining their pockets with bumper pay packets way out of step with the tough economic circumstances. These  councillors are the ultimate champagne socialists.’

When an MP, Sir Peter employed his two daughters, Lauren and Eleanor, as junior secretaries. He also employed his wife Lady Alison, who earned £25,000 a year as office manager.

And he claimed for a £472.59 bailiff’s bill on expenses after debt collectors were sent to his constituency office when he fell behind with his rent in October 2007. The fees office agreed he should not be liable for the bill and reimbursed him.

Sir Peter said the cost of the pay increases was met by his decision earlier this year to get rid of the authority’s chief executive, which saved £250,000. But after details of the rises sparked a row, he last night promised to delay a council vote on implementing them.

‘The report of the remuneration panel was leaked before we had the chance to read or discuss the contents,’ he said.

‘I am firmly of the view that politicians ought not to set their own pay. I also believe that those making recommendations should have an opportunity to understand members’ views and to explain their thinking.

‘I have therefore asked officers to take the item off the agenda for the full council meeting next week. This will give members an opportunity to ask the panel to explain its proposals and, if it sees fit, reconsider them.’
