Leicester City have had a £5million bid rejected for Wigan midfielder James McArthur but chairman Dave Whelan says he will consider improved offers. 

Burnley have also been rebuffed in four attempts to sign McArthur while Crystal Palace are also keen on the Scotland international.

Wigan chairman Whelan said: 'We need the right offer. I don’t want to stop the lad from going into the Premier League. We have to get enough money to get the necessary replacement.

'There is bound to be more offers from other Premier League clubs or Leicester because he is such a tough, quality player. We will be so sorry to lose him, but football being football sometimes you have to accept it.'

Burnley are considering Bolton midfielder Mark Davies as a potential alternative to McArthur.

Wigan, meanwhile, have opened talks with Tours over a £2million deal for striker Andy Delort, 22, who has also attracted interest from Charlton and Leeds.

Fulham are in talks to sign Iranian defender Ehsan Hajsafi and have agreed terms with former Crystal Palace goalkeeper Gabor Kiraly. Hajsafi, 24, represented his country at the World Cup and has more than 60 caps. 

He can play at left-back or in midfield and will cost around £250,000. Kiraly, now 38, is joining from 1860 Munich for a similar fee.

Premier league experience: Kiraly represented Crystal Palace, Aston Villa and West Ham in the top flight
