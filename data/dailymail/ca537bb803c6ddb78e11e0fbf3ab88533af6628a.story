A devoted couple who never spent a day apart in 68 years of marriage died just 10 hours apart.

George Doughty, 91, was in intensive care with a chest infection when his wife Dorothy, 92, suddenly died.

Mr Doughty then passed away just hours later - he did not know his wife had been admitted.

George Doughty, 91, became ill with a chest infection and was in hospital when his wife Dorothy, 92, suddenly died. The couple shared the same wedding anniversary as the Queen and went to London for the Queen's garden party to celebrate their golden wedding anniversary in 1997

The couple, from Ashton-under-Lyne, Tameside, Greater Manchester, first met after Mrs Doughty's first husband Victor died during the Second World War after just four months of marriage

The couple, from Ashton-under-Lyne, Tameside, Greater Manchester, met after Mrs Doughty's first husband Victor died during the Second World War after just four months of marriage.

Mr Doughty, and Victor were at school together in Somerset and in the same regiment.

After Victor was killed, Mr Doughty wrote to give commiserations to the young widow and love blossomed during the hardship of war.

Mr Doughty arranged to travel up to meet her in her home town of Stalybridge.

They met for the first time at Manchester Piccadilly railway station - he said he would be carrying a newspaper and Mrs Doughty held a rose.

After getting married the couple had two sons Allan and 
Paul.

Mr Doughty returned to work as a baker after the war and Mrs Doughty
owned a salon with her son Paul in Ashton Under Lyne.

When they 
retired they focused their life around their family - they have five grandchildren Stuart, Mark, Rachel, Andrew and Adelle and two great-grandchildren Charlotte and Mabel.

They spent their time volunteering at Tameside League of Friends at the hospital and Mrs Doughty also enjoyed being a member of King Georges Bowling Club with her sister, Audrey Stopford, 88.

The couple shared the same wedding anniversary as the Queen and went to London for 
the Queen's garden party to celebrate their golden wedding anniversary in
 1997.

Ten years later they celebrated their 60th diamond anniversary 
surrounded by their family and friends.

Mr Doughty was admitted to Tameside Hospital with pneumonia on 21 May and moved to intensive care where he was sedated on 23 May.

His wife was then admitted to a general ward on 24 May, but because she had shingles she was not permitted to visit her husband in intensive care.

Mrs Doughty contracted an infection, and unable to fight the virus, she died June 1 at 2.30pm.

Her husband then passed away 2 June at 12.30am.

Their son Paul said: 'So many people have said to us that there is comfort in knowing that they were together right at the end.

'They didn’t know each other had passed and didn’t have that stress. It came as such a shock.

'They were just two lovely people who were very family orientated and wanted to be involved in everything.

'They’d been married for 68 years and they were always together - they never spent a day apart.'

Their funeral took place last week at St James' Church in Ashton-under-Lyne.

Their coffins lay side by side - hers topped with the newspaper and his, a rose.
