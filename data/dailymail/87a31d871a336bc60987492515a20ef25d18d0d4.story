Hervey Farrell, 38, was booked on charges of voyeurism and extortion in New Orleans

A taxi driver was arrested on Monday for secretly filming lewd footage of a drunken lawyer and trying to blackmail her into not releasing the tape.

Hervey Farrell, 38, demanded $1,000 to destroy the tape, which if released could have damaged the woman's career.

Police in New Orleans have charged Farrell with extortion and voyeurism over the April 2012 incident.

The 32-year-old woman has not been named but is said to be a well known lawyer and radio personality in the New Orleans area.

In an interview with NOLA.com the woman told how she was so drunk she did not realize she was being filmed.

The video footage, filmed under her skirt, shows her underwear and genitals.

'I was intoxicated, I had had too much to drink,' the woman said.

'But that doesn't make it OK for him to have done what he did. What he did to me was criminal, and wrong.'

The woman said she had been out with friends and was drunk when she got into Farrell's taxi in Bourbon Street.

She admitted flirting with the driver and kissed him, but insisted she did not give him permission to film her.

The woman said she was in no fit state to realize Farrell was taping her on his cell phone or that she had inadvertently exposed herself.

When she asked Farrell why he had stopped kissing her she said he told her 'don't touch m'e

The taxi driver later filed charges against the lawyer claiming she had battered him.

Months later, the woman said, a letter was sent to her attorney which referred to the video footage.

The woman said Ferrell originally asked for $60,000 in exchange for dropping the charges against her and destroying the video.

The woman said that the amount was at some point lowered to $1,000 but that she decided to file a police report instead of paying.

A warrant for Farrell's arrest on charges of voyeurism and extortion was issued.

Farrell was picked up and arrested by members of the New Orleans Police Department.

He is being held on a combined $20,000 bond on both charges.

A first-offense voyeurism conviction carries a maximum two-year sentence.

Someone convicted of extortion must serve at least one year and up to 15 years in prison.
