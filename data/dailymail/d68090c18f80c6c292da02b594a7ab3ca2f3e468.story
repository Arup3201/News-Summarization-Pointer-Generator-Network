Convicted US molester Ed Kramer has been accused of following a Brisbane teenager on Twitter

An American man who was convicted for molesting three teenage boys could spend life behind bars for allegedly following a 14-year-old Brisbane girl on Twitter.

Ed Kramer, co-founder of the popular US sci-fi convention Dragon Con, is serving a five-year sentence via house arrest in Georgia after last year pleading guilty to child molestation counts involving three boys aged 13 to 15.

A judge deemed that Kramer's poor health warranted his house arrest, rather than prison, because he suffered severe spinal injuries from a jail riot.

He was not required to go on trial and  agreed to a plea bargain which ordered him not to have contact 'either direct or indirect with any person under the age of 16'. Now a US District Attorney has alleged he may have broken that agreement by following a young Brisbane girl on Twitter.

Kramer was the co-founder of Dragon Con but has since sold his stake in the travelling US comic convention

The American lawyer Danny Porter has been following the convicted molester's movements since 2005 and believes if he is found guilty of allegedly following the 14-year-old he could be jailed for life.

Mr Porter told US newspaper, the Gwinnet Daily Post, that Kramer followed some 1,900 people on his Twitter account recently - which has since been deleted -  including the teenager.

Mr Porter said the convicted molester's chances of being imprisoned for life, if found guilty, are  'certainly possible.'

In January 2011, Kramer joined Twitter under the handle @edwardekramer. He sent a handful of tweets at that time but, for more than three years, the account remained dormant.

About two weeks ago, it came back to life but Daily Mail Australia's attempts to locate it have proved unsuccessful and it appears it may have been removed.

The founder of Dragon Con, one of the US biggest comic book and science fiction conventions, pleaded guilty back in December to sexually abusing three boys in incidents that date as far back as 1996.

His lawyers said the 53-year-old science fiction writer and geek culture pioneer maintains his innocence - and only wanted to end the legal case against him because his health couldn't handle the rigors of a trial.

His victims have spoken about their treatment at the hands of Kramer, including one teenage boy who told a judge during a December court appearance: 'It doesn’t affect me on a day-to-day basis, but it is paralyzing when it does set in,' he told the judge.

This latest accusation leveled against him could lead to a 60-year prison sentence, according to the  the Gwinnet Daily Post, representing 20 years for each count of child molestation Kramer pleaded guilty to in December.

Without a violation, he would have about 28 months of a 34-month house arrest sentence left to serve.

The Australian Federal Police has been contacted for comment on this story.
