A man has plummeted 80ft to his death from the City tower that houses London's exclusive Coq d'Argent restaurant.

Horrifed eye-witnesses called police after the man - who was pronounced dead at the scene - was seen falling from a walkway on the same level as Sir Terence Conran's restaurant inside No.1 Poultry in the City at 12.41pm today.

It is the fourth instance of a person falling to their death from the tower housing the French restaurant - which featured in a James Bond-themed sequence at the Opening Ceremony for the Olympics this summer - over the past five years.

Scene: Witnesses called police after a man was seen falling to his death from a walkway in No 1 Poultry yards from the entrance to the rooftop restaurant Coq d'Argent

City of London Police have launched an investigation but are not treating the man's death as suspicious.

It is thought man, who was said to be wearing a suit, took a lift to the restaurant and then walked along a walkway over the atrium.

Eyewitness Rita Olsen, a Danish tourist who has only been in England for two days on a holiday, said: 'Someone screamed and I couldn't see what was happening, but thought that maybe there had been a car crash or something but when all the police showed up I realised someone had died.

'I left soon after because there was too much business, but I heard someone say that a man had fallen from the building.

'It is really sad and I'm still in shock. I was horrified when I found out what had happened.

'I have only been in England for two days and this happens. I feel sorry for whoever he has left behind,' she added.

Last month 29-year-old Rema Beauty Begum fell eight storeys from the top of Coq D'Argent, landing in front of hundreds of commuters outside Bank station.

It later emerged that the City worker had attended a job interview that day.

Eyewitnesses said at the time that she took a sip of wine from her glass on the outdoor terrace, before putting her handbag on the floor and then toppling over the edge of the restaurant.

In July 2009, stockbroker Anjool Malde, 
24, leaped to his death from the venue holding a glass of champagne 
after being suspended from his job at Deutsche Bank.

In May 2007, City employee Richard Ford, 33, died after he plunged from the terrace and landed on a bus.

It is the fourth time a person has fallen to their death from the tower in the past five years

Today's incident came almost exactly 
one month after father-of-one Kevan Ward, 46, fell 350 ft to his death 
outside the Willis Building in the City.

Mr Ward was head of security at the tower and later his family said they were 'at a loss' to say why he acted.

A
London Ambulance Service spokeswoman said today: 'We were called at 
12.41pm to reports of a fall from height at Poultry in the City.

'Our
staff treated a man who had suffered a cardiac arrest. Sadly, the 
patient was pronounced dead on the scene by the doctor from the medical 
team at 1.04pm.'

Coq d'Argent was seen in the film 
made for the London 2012 Olympic Ceremony, which featured the Queen, 
alongside James Bond actor Daniel Craig, apparently flying over the 
tower en route to the Olympic Stadium in Stratford, where Her Majesty 
'parachuted' in for the opening ceremony. Diners were seen waving to the
helicopter.

Sir Terence Conran's exclusive Coq d'Argent is at the top of No.1 Poultry in the City

Coq d’Argent serves classic French 
food at its rooftop restaurant which lies in formal gardens with 
panoramic views across the City.

The terrace is currently closed for the winter.

A spokesman for D&D London, owners of the restaurant, said: ‘A police investigation is currently underway into the tragic incident today at No.1 Poultry.

‘At present it appears to us that the individual concerned did not enter the restaurant. It would be inappropriate to comment further at this stage.

‘At Coq d’Argent the health and safety of our customers is of paramount importance. We have complied with and have confirmation that all requisite safety standards are in place.

‘Since the sad incident of last month, we continue to explore other measures to prevent these tragedies reoccurring.  We are working closely with the police, health and safety authorities, the owners of the building and the Samaritans’
