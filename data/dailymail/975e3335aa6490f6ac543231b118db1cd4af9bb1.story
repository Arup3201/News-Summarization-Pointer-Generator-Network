New mom Claire Danes has opened about her debut in motherhood, with son, Cyrus, born two weeks ago.

The 33-year-old Homeland actress posed for the cover of Elle magazine's latest issue just months before giving birth, and has revealed that she has no intention of quitting her Emmy award-winning role.

She said in the magazine's February issue, on sale January 15: 'I think I would make a lousy 
stay-at-home mom. It just wouldn’t suit me. I feel so fortunate, in that
I’ve had this arrow-straight focus…that I wanted to act.

'I’ve always wanted to have kids, but 
I’m glad I didn’t until now. When I was thinking about [working and 
being a mother] originally, I was really nervous about it…,' she added.

Ms Danes has been married to actor Hugh Dancy, 37, since 2009, who she describes as 'just the right partner for me.'

'I got very, very lucky,' she said. 'There’s only so much credit you can take when 
it just sort of works, you know?

'And obviously we work hard at 
maintaining our relationship – that is central to both our lives – but 
at the same time, it’s just this kind of ease that I can’t really 
account for.'

The self-confessed WASP had a six-year relationship with Australian musician Ben Lee, before they split in 2003.

She then met Mr Dancy on the set of the film Evening and began dating in 2007.

The Romeo and Juliet star also recalled how she had to have a shot of Vodka after meeting President Obama with her husband at the White House Correspondent’s dinner.

She said: 'Hugh was like, "We have to meet Obama," and we walked over before we could think and found ourselves shaking hands with him.

'Hugh realized that he’d forgotten to actually properly introduce himself, and [President Obama] was like, "And you are?" And Hugh was like, "I’m sorry, Mr. President." 

'I said, "I’m Claire Danes," and he said, "Oh, you’re a fine actress." And I said, "You’re a fine president!" And he said, "Oh, you’re a finer actress than I am president." I didn’t have any retort.  Hugh and I went immediately to the bar and had a big shot of vodka.'

The actress admits she is glad her Hollywood celebrity launched in the mid Nineties (her first feature film was Little Women in 1994), rather than today.

'When I was younger, I was a little bit more restless, but there weren’t as many eyes,' she explained.

'There weren’t as many tabloids or the number of cameras that everyone’s armed with. I feel huge sympathy for teenagers who have suddenly found themselves as public figures now, because it just sucks for them.'

As of 2011, Ms Danes has starred as Carrie Mathison in the Showtime series Homeland in which she plays a CIA agent, who, unbeknownst to her employer, suffers from bipolar disorder.

Her character believes a U.S. Marine Corps war hero is planning a terrorist attack while being tapped for high profile government service.

She won the 2012 Golden Globe for Best Actress in a Television Series and the 2012 Emmy for Outstanding Lead Actress in a Drama Series for her performance in Homeland.

After winning her Emmy, Ms Danes thanked: 'My husband, my love, my 
life, my baby daddy. 'I couldn't do anything without you. I love you so much and I am so grateful.'

TIME Magazine also named Ms Danes one of the 100 most influential people in the World.

The February issue of Elle hits newsstands nationwide on January 15th.
