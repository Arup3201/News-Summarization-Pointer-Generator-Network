Kelly Brook 'tore strips' off her on-off lover for crashing a van-load of dead badgers while working as part of an animal cull, it emerged today.

David McIntosh - formerly 'Tornado' in TV series Gladiators - had been employed to take dead badgers for disposal as part of the controversial cull in Gloucestershire.

But his animal-loving girlfriend, who once appeared in an advert for animal rights activists Peta, was reportedly furious to discover he was part the government-backed scheme to reduce TB in cows.

A friend of the model told The Sun: 
'David didn't tell Kelly about the incident, hoping it would pass. But 
she tore strips off him when she found out because of her history with 
Peta.'

Mr McIntosh told the paper: 'I love animals. I wasn't part of the cull. I was transporting them.'

Magistrates
 heard that as the 28-year-old former Royal Marine drove his VW 
Transporter van to a furnace in the middle of the night, he swerved and 
smashed into a bus stop.

He 
claimed to have lost control when a radio - which police used to pass on
 intelligence about the location of anti-cull protesters - fell under 
the brakes, Stroud Magistrates’ Court heard.

But
 a witness told the panel that McIntosh may have crashed after falling 
asleep during the night shift in Gloucester city centre just before 1am 
on September 29.

He admitted driving without due care and attention and not having a valid licence.

Passenger
 John Parker - who suffered bruised ribs, thigh, face and wrist in the 
crash - told the court he was checking Facebook on his phone when he 
felt the van change direction.

Reading
 Mr Parker's statement, prosecutor Graham Dono said: ‘I looked up after 
feeling the vehicle change direction to see a bus stop.

‘I
 can't say if he was asleep on not, but when I looked at David both of 
his hands were on the wheel, but his head was on his chest. I believe 
his eyes were shut.’

The court heard McIntosh, of Altrincham, 
Cheshire, had managed to get the job as a driver despite having his 
licence for that class of vehicle suspended for running a red light in 
2005.

Mr
 Parker said during the incident he shouted and grabbed the wheel, 
shocking McIntosh into action, who hit the accelerator and smashed into 
the bus shelter.

In a 
statement read out in court, McIntosh, a former Royal Marine driver 
said: ‘I was carrying badger carcasses to the furnace as I was involved 
in the cull.

‘The radio was 
always kept in the vehicle on the dashboard so we could easily hear and 
keep up with police as to where the protesters were. It was blocking the
 clutch and the brake.

'Before I retrieved it I was heading off the road. I started to brake but it was too late.’

District Judge Joti Bopa-Rai said: ‘It is either that he has fallen asleep or been distracted.’

Unemployed McIntosh was fined £91, plus a £20 victim surcharge and £30 prosecution costs. He was given six penalty points.

McIntosh is a TV personality, model, bodybuilder and former ‘security operative’.

He
 has served in Afghanistan, Northern Ireland, Somalia, and the Persian 
Gulf. He was deployed to Afghanistan in October 2008 for six months.

Despite
 claims he was dumped by Miss Brook for being too fame-hungry - 
something he denies - McIntosh was pictured together with her heading to
 her London bar Steam & Rye on Monday night.

Around a dozen anti-cull protestors attended the hearing and waved placards outside court.

They
 were angered an alleged ‘collusion’ between the police and cull workers
 via radio, and also that McIntosh was able to get a job without a valid
 licence.

Steve Tomlin, 64, 
who spent 100 nights out in Somerset and Gloucestershire during the 
cull, said: ‘Why wasn't he breathalysed? This is a case of a politically
 motivated blind spot.’

Jude
 Walker, 58, of Gloucestershire Against Badger Shooting, added: ‘It 
certainly goes against what we have always been told about the police 
being even handed. And what happened to the badgers?’

Police
 have denied McIntosh's claims that he was in contact with officers via 
radio. 'At no point did police communicate the location of protesters to
 any contractors,' a spokesman told The Sun.

The address given in court for McIntosh in Greater Manchester matches the business of his company, Next Generation Fitness Ltd.

Miss Brook has previously posed for campaigns for People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (Peta) - who opposed the cull.

Natural England authorised two pilot culls of badgers, which were paid for by farmers.

A
 spokesman for the public body said that it issued licenses to culling 
companies which in turn employed their own marksmen. He added: ‘Daniel 
McIntosh is not a Natural England employee.'

The court heard the van was travelling from Tewkesbury to Maisemore in Gloucestershire.

McIntosh
 contacted the DVLA after the incident and was told his licence was 
revoked in 2005 for going through a red light, it was said.

His
 letter to the court said: 'I have had numerous hire cars and have been 
stopped by police for random checks and not once was it flagged up.'

District
 Judge Rai said: 'I have heard that this was part of the badger cull 
operation. I have to exclude anything to do with the badger cull. I am 
looking at the driving of an individual.'

Neither Mr Parker nor McIntosh were in court.

A
 spokesman for McIntosh said last night: 'David McIntosh was in a minor 
car accident last year that did not involve any other vehicles.  At the 
time David worked as hired security for various companies and 
assignments.

‘Specifically 
in this case, he was hired to provide secure transportation in the 
operation of badger culling where firearms were being used.

‘He
 was there to prevent any intervention as to insure the safety of staff 
as well as the safety of protesters by preventing any altercations.

‘David
 was not involved in the culling operation or process he was merely 
doing the job assigned to him of security and transportation.

‘David
 loves animals and his personal views are against the practice of 
culling badgers - but as an ex-military, David knows to separate between
 his personal beliefs and feelings to the legal task or job at hand he 
was hired to do.

‘The matter of the accident was resolved in court where David had to pay a fine for the traffic violation.'
