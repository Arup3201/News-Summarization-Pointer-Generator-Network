Comedian Russell Brand was allegedly ejected from the GQ Men Of The Year Awards after-show party after he made jibes onstage about the event's sponsors Hugo Boss - and its historical links to the Nazis.

The comic, who picked up a gong at the GQ Men of the Year Awards, criticised the German fashion firm, who sponsored the show, for making uniforms for Hitler's regime.

The wild bunch: Rita Ora, Noel Gallagher and Russell Brand caught up at the after-party before he was allegedly asked to leave by the event's organisers 

Brand took to the stage after Boris Johnson who received GQ magazine’s award for Politician of the Year at Tuesday night's event at the Royal Opera House in London.

And after the mayor made jokes regarding the recent chemical attacks and subsequent deaths in Syria, Brand said: 'Glad to grace the stage where Boris Johnson has just made light of the use of chemical weapons in Syria,'  during his acceptance speech for the Oracle award.

'Meaning that GQ can now stand for genocide quips.

'I
 mention that only to make the next comment a bit lighter because if any
 of you know a little bit about history and fashion, you'll know Hugo 
Boss made the uniforms for the Nazis,' he added.

'But they did look f****** fantastic, lets face it, while they were killing people on the basis of their religion and sexuality."

Brand, who ended his speech by telling Noel Gallagher, another of the winners on the night, "Good luck getting more offensive than that, son", was then according to The Sun kicked out of the aftershow party in central London.

A spokesman for GQ declined to comment on the claims when contacted.

Brand was seen chatting to Noel Gallagher and Rita Ora at the party, but he looked unnerved after taking a few photos with fans, and then made a swift exit accompanied by his security guard.

Brand took to Twitter to tell his fans about an exchange he said he had with Jones

The comic took to Twitter to tell his
 fans about an exchange he said he had with the magazine's editor Dylan 
Jones, writing: 'GQ editor: What you did was very offensive to Hugo 
Boss.

'Me: What Hugo Boss did was very offensive to the Jews', which was accompanied by the hashtag '#nazitailor'.

The
 fashion firm backed the event to the tune of £250,000, and would no 
doubt have been left reeling by Brand's tirade which included him 
putting a finger under his nose to mimic Hitler's moustache and 
goose-stepping on stage.

It isn't the first time Brand has run into trouble at the annual bash. In 2006 he was involved in a row with Rod Stewart after telling guests at the event he had slept with his daughter Kimberly.

In 1999, GQ editor James Brown resigned after the magazine published a list of of the 200 most stylish men of the 20th century, which included the Nazis and Field Marshal Rommel alongside Humphrey Bogart and John F Kennedy.

The star-studded dinner and pretty 
raucous award ceremony with a night full of barbs and verbal fisticuffs 
attended by 
celebrities including Lou Reed, Simon Pegg, Sir Bobby Charlton, Rita Ora, Rosie Huntington-Whiteley and Justin 
Timberlake.

Off colour: Rob Brydon joked about Stephen Fry's suicide attempt

The
 event at the Royal Opera House, in 
Covent Garden, central London, was hosted by comic Rob Brydon who led 
from the front with an off colour remark about Stephen Fry.

Brydon
 reduced the audience to stunned silence when he joked bipolar Stephen 
Fry could not be 'left alone with vodka and pills', which comes after 
the actor and writer's admission that he tried to commit suicide last 
year.

Writer of the Year winner, Charles Moore took aim at Brand when took to the stage to collect his award.

He reminded the audience of
 the BBC scandal Brand resigned from Radio 2 over - Sachsgate.

Moore refused to pay his license fee in 2009 in protest over the 
affair, in which Brand, egged on by Jonathan Ross, left inappropriate 
messages on the voicemail of Fawlty Towers actor Andrew Sachs about his 
granddaughter.

The writer compared Brand's persecution of Sachs to that of the Nazis persecution of Sachs' forefathers.

Meanwhile Noel Gallagher criticised 
Foreign Secretary William Hague, who presented an award, for being 'here
 with all the s**t going on around the world you should be sorting out'.
