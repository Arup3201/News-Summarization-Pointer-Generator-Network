The future is looking bright for British actor Jack O'Connell, who last night won the Rising Star Award at the EE British Academy Film Awards.

But 24-year-old actor admits his life could have turned out quite differently after he attended a 'rough' school in Derbyshire and then had a number of brushes with the law.

He won the Bafta thanks to acclaimed roles playing a violent teenager imprisoned in Starred Up and a prisoner of war in Angelina's Jolie's Unbroken.

But while Jack has found success in Hollywood by playing characters who are behind bars, he has also come close to being locked up himself.

'I haven't done time, but only by the skin of my teeth,' he once admitted. 

Now keen to put his misdemeanors behind him, he's reluctant to speak about his crimes in interviews but has confirmed he once faced a custodial sentence.

Speaking to Megan Conner for the Guardian last year, he said: 'Some of the roles, like Eric in Starred Up (Eric is a violent youth offender who is taken to an adult prison in the film), haven't been much of a stretch, really. 

'It's just quite hard for me to be open about it. Partly because the stuff I got involved in as a kid was quite serious, and partly because I've now got my American visa. 

The actor, pictured in the film Starred Up in 2013, said playing Eric, a troubled teen who ends up in prison, wasn't 'much of a stretch' as he once faced a custodial sentence himself

The actor dated Tulisa in 2012 but they split up due to 'incompatible work schedules'

'When I was younger, I got into a lot of trouble and was made to feel guilty for a long time. I was in and out of court, and then I had a young offender's referral order for a year. And that was at the time when I was trying to be an actor at the Royal Court. 

'I was in real court the day I was starting a play called Scarborough at the Royal Court in London – waiting to find out if I was getting a custodial sentence.'

But fortunately for Jack, he wasn't locked up for the 'serious' crime and eventually went on to establish himself as a leading man in Hollywood.

He admits the glittery awards parties and dinners with Angelina Jolie are a far cry from his working class upbringing in Alvaston, Derby, where he once had dreams of being a footballer or joining the army.

His mother, Alison, was an employee for British Midland while his late Irish father Patrick worked on the railways for Bombardier. 

The close-knit family help keep Jack's feet on the ground as his career soars, with his mother now working as his manager and his sister, Megan joining him on the red carpet on numerous occasions.

They both joined him at the Baftas where Jack said they would make sure he stayed on best behaviour while the champagne flowed. 

He joked yesterday: 'I've got my mum and sister down here with me strategically so I'll be well-leashed tonight.' 

Jack attended a catholic secondary school in Derbyshire, which he described as 'rough as f***', and he left with just two GCSEs in English and drama.

Summing up his education in an interview with the Telegraph, he said: 'What I learnt aside from [anything] academic at school was probably very valuable lessons in terms of how to lie, how to play the game, how to play authority against itself.' 

He attended a TV workshop in Nottingham which he thanked in his Bafta acceptance speech as it was there that he made it his mission to pursue a career in acting.

As he tried to make his name as an actor, he juggled his auditions around doing menial work on a farm to earn money.

After a few minor roles in shows like The Bill, he then got lucky being cast as a National Front supporter in This Is England and then a troubled drug dealer in E4's Skins. 

He has since admitted that his background gave him an edge over the other stage school actors trying out for the roles.

Big parts in '71 and Starred Up followed, but his big break into Hollywood came when Angelina cast him as Louis Zamperini in Unbroken.

Jack admits she had to do 'background checks' on him thanks to his criminal past, which made obtaining an American visa difficult.

But Angelina was adamant Jack was the actor she wanted and has championed him ever since, even visiting Derbyshire to meet his family.

Speaking to Vulture about why she cast him, she said: 'I'd seen so many young men for this movie, and it became very clear to me at a certain point that there are so many great actors out there, but there were still things I continued to look for and didn't find. 

'I had to find a man who was a real man's man, who had that physicality, who was an everyman but also disciplined and willing to go to all these places emotionally. It was hard finding that really capable young actor where you really believed he could survive all that time on a raft or could take 220 punches [as Louis does in a POW camp]. 

'There are not a lot of young men in their 20s like that. Jack has something very unique to him. I challenge you to find another young man full of more fire.'

Jack didn't let Jolie down, taking to the part with gusto, even losing a stone in weight to portray the survivor of a Japanese POW camp in World War Two.

He's won rave reviews for the role and has since gone on to be cast in Tulip Fever alongside Dame Judi Dench and Money Monster with George Clooney, directed by Jodie Foster.

Tulip Fever also stars model of the moment Cara Delevingne, sparking rumours that she and Jack were dating.

In his interview with the Guardian last December he didn't confirm or deny the rumours but went as far to say, 'Yeah, I am a boyfriend to someone.' 

When pressed if he was boyfriend to Cara, he said: 'Er, I'm not able to make comment at this stage. Because I've got trust issues. You'll say something I didn't say.' 

If he is dating Cara, it wouldn't be the first time he's had a relationship with a co-star. 

During his time on Skins he dated actress Kaya Scodelario for a year - another rising star to graduate to the big time after recently being cast in the new Pirates of the Caribbean film.  

She once described him as the love of her life and was heartbroken when they split up.

Another famous ex of Jack's is the pop star Tulisa Contostavlos. 

He dated the former X Factor judge for a few months in 2012 but they called time on their relationship due to 'incompatible work schedules.'

Even after their break-up, the singer sang his praises. 

She told Cosmopolitan magazine: (He)was one of the most genuine guys I’ve ever met. 

'He’s never spoken about us publicly. He restored my faith that there are still good guys out there.'

The young actor's schedule certainly looks set to remain busy for the near future as he has come a long way from being a troubled Derbyshire teen.
