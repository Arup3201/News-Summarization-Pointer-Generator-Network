Made out of wood and powered by electricity, it may look like an elaborate go-kart.

But this car is actually an armoured vehicle, which comes complete with radar and even missiles.

It was made by Chinese carpenter Liu Fulong in Shengyang in north east China's Liaoning province.

The armoured electric wooden vehicle which has been created by Chinese carpenter Liu Fulong, taking him four months to build 

The car cost him around £2,100 to build and comes complete with radar and missiles on the side and on top of the roof 

Mr Liu designed and created the car despite having no formal car design training and dropping out of education after primary school 

It took Mr Liu around four months to build costing him nearly 20,000 yuan (£2,100) and is equipped with missiles on the side and roof of the car.

It also contains all the other features you would expect from a car, including wing mirrors and lights and he has even painted a number plate on the front bumper.

The vehicle measures in at eight feet long and four feet wide and weighs more than 350kIlograms.

Mr Liu fixes a headlight to the roof of his car, left, while right, he runs a wire around the front bumper for the electricity 

The carpenter installs the steering wheel in his new car. The vehicle is the second electric wooden vehicle that Mr Liu has created 

It can also reach a speed of up to 30 miles per hour.

But the car is not the first wooden electric vehicle Mr Liu has created.

Earlier this year the 48-year-old made his first wooden electric car, which took him three months to build and reaches speeds of up to 20 miles per hour.

The car is around eight feet long and four feet wide and weighs over 350 kilograms. It can also reach speeds of up to 30 miles per hour 

The carpenter makes his vehicle roadworthy by painting on his own number plate with red paint before heading out on the open road

This is despite the car maker having no formal training in car design and giving up on education after primary school.

It featured wing mirrors, a horn, indicators and even headlights to illuminate the route ahead.

But the sudden appearance of his car on the open road caused amusement for other drivers, who couldn't help but smirk as Mr Liu trundled along the road.
