'Shaman': Juliette D'Souza persuaded a woman to have an abortion by claiming the unborn child was evil and seriously deformed, a fraud trial has heard

A ‘witch doctor’ told clients she was hanging their money from a magical tree in the Amazonian rainforest when she was in fact spending it on Louis Vuitton handbags, a court heard.

Juliette D’Souza, 59, duped people including cancer sufferers out of £1m for ‘sacrifices’ to ward off evil spirits, it is claimed.

But the self proclaimed ‘shaman’ used the cash to rent four luxury flats at a time and blow a fortune on jewellery, antique furniture, and holidays, Blackfriars Crown Court heard.

The court heard that D’Souza’s victims, mostly referred to her by osteopath Keith Bender, were so ‘under her spell’ that they sold their homes at her request.

D’Souza even swindled one woman out of £170,000 before convincing her to have an abortion by claiming that her child would be born seriously deformed, jurors were told.

When the woman realised she had been scammed she broke into one of D’Souza’s rented flats in Hampstead, north London, with Mr Bender.

The pair discovered drawings of the ‘Evil Eye’ symbol, burned photographs half buried in earth, freezers filled with rotting meat, a brand new barrister’s wig, and her pet monkey Joe in a cage.

Mr Bender told the court he referred patients who were having difficulties and personal problems on to D’Souza for treatment.

He said the alleged fraudster and former friend would send him on shopping errands at Louis Vuitton on her ‘clients’ behalf’.

‘Juliette asked me every so often to take her to a particular shop on Bond Street, the lead branch of Louis Vuitton’, Mr Bender said.

‘She would say “I’ve been sent by Rebecca to purchase on her behalf”.

‘Juliette would then buy several Louis Vuitton handbags’.

Jurors have heard Mr Bender ‘genuinely believed’ that D’Souza had special powers until he found the ‘voodoo black magic’ items in her flat in 2007.

He added: ‘We weren’t terribly happy finding and holding those items, we felt that we would be harming ourselves by touching such items.

‘We were frightened and scared just touching those items’.

Case: D'Souza pretended to be a shaman who could cure terminal illnesses and help women conceive babies, Blackfriars Crown Court (pictured) was told. She allegedly tricked the woman into parting with £170,000

The court heard that between 1998 and 
2010 D’Souza duped clients into parting with their cash by claiming she 
had supernatural powers that could cure cancer and infertility.

She also boasted of celebrity clients including Princess Diana and music mogul Simon Cowell, the jury was told.

Mr
 Bender said he would sometimes receive payments into his bank account 
from D’Souza of up to £55,000 at a time that were from her clients.

‘Juliette
 told me that I was simply holding that individual’s monies, that the 
woman’s partner wouldn’t want to know about it’, he added.

‘As
 soon as the money was paid in I was required to get it out in cash, I 
then had to put the money into an envelope and give it to Juliette’.

D’Souza claims she has never professed to be a shaman and blames Mr Bender for the fraud.

But
 the court has heard that a mother of a 10-year-old boy with Down’s 
syndrome was conned out of £42,000 by D’Souza in 2004 after she claimed 
the cash would cure his behavioural problems.

Another
 man was allegedly persuaded to hand over £43,000 to D’Souza between 
2004 and 2006 after she claimed his mother and girlfriend would die if 
he did not send the money.

D’Souza, of Perrin’s Lane, Hampstead, denies 23 charges of obtaining property by deception and fraud.

The trial continues.
