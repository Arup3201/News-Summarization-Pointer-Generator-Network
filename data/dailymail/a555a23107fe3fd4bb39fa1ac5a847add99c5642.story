Hotpants are not the most forgiving of garments, but when one is a Victoria's Secret Angel, you can pull off almost anything.

Lily Donaldson proved that to great effect on Saturday night at the launch of the new Inez and Vinoodh collection for Frame Denim.

At a dinner held at the Dutch photography duo's Lower East Side apartment, Donaldson wore a high-waist, high-hem pair of shorts with a simple black tank and ankle boots, letting her legs make the statement.

The British beauty, 27, partied with fellow models Joan Smalls, Karlie Kloss, Anja Rubik and Constance Jabolonski, all enjoying some down-time from the fashion week fray.

Kloss, who has also collaborated with Frame on jeans with an extra-long leg, wore white denim, while Smalls wore black leather shorts with a white vest and a black leather-and-chiffon vest.

Also among the guests were Net-a-Porter founder Natalie Massenet, Harpers Bazaar's Laura Brown, fashion bloggers Leandra Medine and Hanneli Mustaparta and W Magazine contributor Giovanna Battaglia.

It followed a busy day at New York Fashion Week that took in shows from Altuzarra, Alexander Wang, Ralph Rucci, Mara Hoffman, Herve Leger and Rebecca Taylor, to name but a few.

The eight-day-long event concludes on Thursday with shows from Marc Jacobs, Calvin Klein and Ralph Lauren before moving on to London.
