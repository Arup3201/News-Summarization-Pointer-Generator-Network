Two of Boeing's disaster-hit Dreamliners were forced to abandon flights within 24 hours because of separate technical problems with the toilets and de-icing system.

Japan Airlines Co was forced to turn around its Tokyo-bound flight from Moscow today due to a problem in the jet's lavatory.

JAL spokesman Takuya Shimoguchi said the toilet malfunction was likely caused by an electronic glitch.

Another blow for Boeing: Two 787 Dreamliners like this one flown by Japan Airlines were forced to abandon flights after separate technical issues

The flight, carrying 141 passengers, departed Moscow yesterday evening and returned after about five hours, he said.

The airline was working on repairs on the ground, he added.

Earlier on Wednesday, another JAL Dreamliner heading for Tokyo was diverted back to San Diego because of a possible problem with the aircraft's de-icing system.

NBC-7 in San Diego reported the Japan Airlines flight left Lindbergh Field shortly after 1.30pm local time.

But the plane turned around and landed back in San Diego by 3.10pm.

Hitting turbulence: The incidents follow a spate of problems since the Dreamliner launched in 2009, including a battery fire that temporarily forced the grounding of Boeing's entire fleet of 787s (above)

Airline officials told the television station the pilot received an error message for the de-icing system. The pilot made the decision to go back to San Diego so repairs could be made.

Japan Airlines also had to turn a flight back to Boston's Logan Airport in July due to a possible issue with the plane's fuel pump.

The incidents follow a spate of problems since the Dreamliner's first flight in December 2009, including a battery fire that temporarily forced the grounding world-wide of Boeing's high-profile fleet.

Boeing then redesigned the battery systems which were approved by US aviation regulators.

In July, an Ethiopian Airlines-owned 787 caused Heathrow airport to be shut down for over an hour after the plane caught fire.

Shares in JAL, which made headlines this week by signing with Boeing rival Airbus for the next generation of long-haul jets, were up 2.1 per cent this morning, outperforming the broader market.
