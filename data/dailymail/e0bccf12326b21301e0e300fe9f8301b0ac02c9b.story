When Steve Bruce last met his hometown club in September, Hull led by two with 20 minutes to play and were up into the top four. Newcastle’s Alan Pardew was under attack from the terraces and the Tigers boss was being touted as his replacement.

Papiss Cisse, of course, came from the bench to rescue a point for the Magpies, Pardew kept his job and Hull embarked on a ruinous run which, four months and 11 defeats later, leaves them in the bottom three, Bruce is the new favourite in the Premier League sack race.

‘I don’t fear for my job. It’s part and parcel, it’s my turn,’ said the under-fire manager, whose side were booed following Saturday’s 3-0 reverse having now lost four on the spin without scoring a goal.

This was the first time Newcastle have scored three goals away from home since their 4-1 win at Hull in March of last year. 

‘I’ve been in it long enough to roll up my sleeves. The one thing I’m not going to do is chuck it in. I’ve had a great two and a half years here.

‘We’ve got enough here to stay up and I’m convinced we will do.’

There was precious little evidence to support that conviction at the weekend. Newcastle, thanks to stunning goals from Remy Cabella and Sammy Ameobi and Yoan Gouffran’s late strike, gave John Carver an easy first victory as head coach.

On Monday, Bruce will turn to three men he hopes can salvage Hull’s season. Former Manchester United assistant boss Mike Phelan arrives as his new No.2, while Spurs winger Aaron Lennon and Lokomotiv Moscow striker Dame N’Doye are expected to sign before transfer deadline.

Bruce, though, hopes the pair did not watch their sorry showing against Newcastle.

‘I have to say, performances like that don’t do us any favours (in signing players),’ he said.

‘But we hope to get them in, it’s up to the individuals now.

‘They will be a goal threat. Something up the top end of the pitch might just open up the door for us.

‘That’s 12 times out of the last 16 we’ve not scored. We’ve made enough chances but we haven’t scored. Newcastle had four shots and they scored three goals, therein lies the difference.’

On Phelan, he added: ‘I’ve known Mick a long time. He’s the right man at the right time. He should give everyone a lift.’

Newcastle’s victory, meanwhile, was their first of 2015 and Carver believes he can now win the job on a permanent basis having told the players not to view his appointment as a temporary measure.

‘One of the first things I did with the group was to get them together and say that this is not an interim position,’ he said.

‘If you look at the title it is not interim head coach, it is head coach. I said to the guys, “Listen, I'm in this position, we have got 16 games to go and our season starts now".'

Bruce, too, will be hoping for new beginnings with Phelan by his side.
