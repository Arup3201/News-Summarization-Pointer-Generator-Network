Toyota is recalling 2.27 million vehicles worldwide and 19,600 in Australia over fears a faulty airbag inflator could explode and cause a fire.

The company said it was notifying owners of vehicles involved in a 2013 safety recall to replace airbag inflators, having previously asked dealers to inspect airbags and only replace those judged to be faulty.

The recall involves about 20 Toyota 
models, including some Corolla compacts made in 
2003-2004 and some 2002-2004 Lexus SC 430 coupes.

Toyota is recalling 19,600 vehicles in Australia and 2.27 million worldwide over fears the airbag inflators could explode

'The involved vehicles were equipped with front passenger airbag inflators which could have been assembled with improperly manufactured propellant wafers,' the car maker said in a statement.

'(That) could cause the inflator to rupture and the front passenger airbag to deploy abnormally in the event of a crash.'

A company spokesman in Tokyo said it had received a complaint from a Japanese customer who said his passenger seat was burned from the defect.

The spokesman added that no serious injuries or accidents had been reported.

Of the total number of vehicles affected by the current recall, 650,000 are in Japan and 1.62 million in the rest of the world.

Nissan and Honda are also investigating whether to recall more vehicles after parts maker Takata admitted that it had not fully identified the flawed components during a 2013 recall.

Last year carmakers including Toyota, Honda, Nissan
 Motor Co and BMW recalled 3.6 million vehicles due to 
problems with the airbag inflator that could potentially explode and 
injure the driver or passengers.

Shares of Takata dropped after the announcement and were down over 4 percent when the Tokyo market closed.

The Takata recall in 2013 was the largest airbag-related recall in history and came after a series of accidents and at least two deaths allegedly caused by faulty airbags.

In 2013 Nissan, Honda, Toyota and BMW recalled a total of 3.6million vehicles after the fault was discovered. Nissan and Honda are investigating whether they are affected by this new fault

Takata admitted it improperly stored chemicals and botched the manufacture of propellants used to inflate airbags, some of which were used in Honda vehicles
