Sean Penn is adamant that he has no reason to apologize for making a green card jibe at the expense of Mexican director Alejandro Iñárritu while handing him his Oscar for Birdman.

When the time came to reveal to the Academy that Iñárritu had triumphed, Penn asked 'Who gave this son of a bitch his green card?' before announcing his film as the winner.

The joke prompted a storm of outrage from critics who branded the comments xenophobic - but Penn has today said he has 'absolutely no apologies' and that the only reason anyone could be offended is their own 'flagrant stupidity'.

'Who gave that son of a bitch a green card?': Sean Penn, left, was criticized for a joke he directed at Alejandro Iñárritu, right, while handing him an Oscar. He called the reaction 'flagrant stupidity'

According to Penn, the jibe was part of his friendship with Iñárritu, with whom he has worked in the past - and even a way to let him know of his victory seconds before everyone else.

Speaking at a promo event in Beverly Hills for one of his own movies, Penn said of the reaction to the joke: 'I'm always surprised by flagrant stupidity. I keep having more hope.'

He later added: 'I have absolutely no apologies'.

'In fact, I have a big [expletive] you for every...anybody who is so stupid not to have gotten the irony when you've got a country that is so xenophobic.

'If they had their way, you wouldn't have great filmmakers like Alejandro working in this country. Thank god we do.'

'I found it hilarious. Sean and I have that kind of brutal [relationship] where only true friendship can survive.'

Iñárritu directed Penn in the 2003 film 21 Grams and the two remain close.

'I make on him a lot of very tough jokes that I will not tell you,' Iñárritu added.

While Iñárritu's casual dismissal of any perceived offense helped to temper the public response to the comment, Penn has remained largely silent on the topic. 

Penn also clarified that the order of his comments were intentional.

'There's a little inside humor with he and I where I know, and wanted to know, that he would be the first person in that room to know that his film won,' he said.
