Shocking images of a gunman moments before he shot dead six people in front of an ex-girlfriend who had ended their relationship were today released by police.

Dmitry Vinogradov, 29, launched his deadly attack, which lasted just 18 seconds, in a Moscow office yesterday.

CCTV footage of the disgruntled lawyer shows him walking into the building wearing a large rucksack carrying guns, heading into a toilet and then emerging heavily armed and clad all in black.

He then walks calmly up stairs, killing two men on the way, and into an office where he killed four more.

Calm: Vinogradov heads into the toilet to get changed and prepare for his massacre

Killer: Vinogradov approaches the finance department. At this point, he has already murdered two people on the stairs

His former girlfriend, accounts department clerk Anna Kaznikova, 26, can be seen running from the room. She escaped unharmed.

Vinogradov was then overpowered by office workers, and tied up by security guards.

His sixth victim, Nikita Strelnikov, died today. The 30-year-old suffered multiple wounds in the massacre as he sought to shield female colleagues from the gunman.

Two women and three other men were also killed in the shooting spree in the offices of a pharmaceutical company; all were shot in the head. 

The other three
male victims were named as Alexander Biryuk, Andrei Tertiakov and Denis
 Moiseev, all 33, and the women were Elena Lapshina and Natalia 
Plekhanova, both 25.

Yaroslava
 Sergenyuk, 24, was struck by a bullet to her chest which pierced her 
lung, and another which damaged her nose. She was rushed to hospital by 
helicopter and is fighting for her life.

Determined: The gunman is just a couple of seconds away from murdering four more people in cold blood

Terror: Vinogradov's former girlfriend Anna Kaznikova runs away from the massacre

Fleeing: The 26-year-old was not targeted in the attack and escaped unharmed

Apprehended: After 18 seconds of intense bloodshed, Vinogradov is overpowered by office workers and then tied up by security guards

Major incident: Vinogradov lies on the floor as shocked office workers look on

Vinogradov's rampage was sparked 
after he was jilted by Miss Kaznikova. It was first reported that she 
had been wounded, but it now appears her ex-boyfriend let her escape 
unscathed,

He had called her minutes before storming the office room where she works.

Instead of at her, he aimed his two 
guns - one in each hand - at office workers who he blamed for mocking 
him, thus prompting her to end their relationship.

The spree lasted only 18 seconds before he ran out of ammunition and was overpowered.

Kaznikova
 did not speak about the shooting but she revealed: 'We started dating 
in summer last year. He made me little sweet presents, took me to the 
cinema. But he was too romantic for me, wenever got too close.

'We
 finally split up in winter when he started being angry. He was really 
jealous. In January, he sent me a text message and blamed me for making 
him feel angry. He also called me rude names.'

Hours before his bloody attack, Vinogradov posted a 'manifesto of hate' on the internet, comparing mankind to a 'giant cancer tumour'.

Witness: Anya Kaznikova saw her colleagues shot in the head by her ex-boyfriend, ten months after she broke up with him

Killing spree: Vinogradov (left) shot dead six people at the pharmaceutical company where he worked as a lawyer. He later told police that his work colleagues were to blame for ending his relationship with Miss Kaznikova (right), who also worked at the Moscow firm

His sinister manifesto, posted at 
4.56am yesterday, drew immediate comparisons with Norwegian mass killer Anders 
Breivik, who shot dead 69 people at a camp last year.

Police
 say Vinogradov came to the Rigla plant at Chermyanskaya Street, Moscow,
 where his ex-girlfriend worked, at 9am and was allowed in as a lawyer 
for the company.

Miss Kaznikova said Vinogradov was initially nice, buying her cinema tickets and her favourite pancakes, before becoming possessive and angry

The killer then went to the toilet 
where he changed into army fatigues and went out into the depot with a 
Saiga hunting rifle and an Italian-made Benelli shotgun.

He gunned down two men on the stairs before going into his ex-girlfriend's office where he shot his other victims. 

In a chilling confession, he later 
told police: ‘We were dating for a long time but in January this year we
 split up. I tried to get her back but failed.

'In March, I bought a rifle and 200 bullets and a uniform. 

‘My colleagues are to blame - they 
advised Anya to split with me. I came into the office where Anya worked 
and said: “Hello, colleagues”, and she saw how I began to shoot all of 
them. 

‘I wanted them to see how strong I was and then I planned to kill myself.’

Vinogradov’s
 mother Elena Vinogradova revealed on Wednesday that the couple had 
rowed before breaking up over a romantic trip he had booked to take her 
to Scotland

She said: ‘He quarreled with that girl Anya from the finance department. He is from the law department.

'I understand it that his shooting was in the finance department. It is likely that they mocked him somehow.

‘Before
 they split up, he bought her a trip to Edinburgh, ordered everything, 
paid for it all, and some two days before it she said: “I'm not going." He was in a horrible depression after that.’

Vinogradova had been on medication to cope with his depression but had not taken it the day before the shooting.

His mother added: ‘He was absolutely quiet yesterday,’ adding that she had tried to discourage his interest in shooting.

In
 his manifesto posted on a Russian social site which also included 
racist images, Vinogradov declared: ‘I hate human society and I am 
disgusted to be a part of it! I hate the senselessness of human life! I 
hate this very life! I see only one way to justify it - to destroy as 
many parts of the human compost as possible.

‘This
 is the only right thing which everyone of us can do in his life, it is 
the only way to justify it, the only way to make this world better.

‘The
 way of surviving and self-perfection of a man is a mistake, it leads to
 a dead end, to destroying of all the rest, of all what is really alive.''

Another life: Vinogradov is pictured saving a seagull from an oil slick in 2010 as a World Widelife Foundation  volunteer

‘Evolve! Become aware of your real 
meaning and place in this world! Understand that you are aliens here, 
you are the genetic rubbish which should not be here, rubbish which 
appeared accidentally, as a result of a mistake in evolution, rubbish 
which must be destroyed.’

One image carried the slogan 'End Racism Kill Everyone', featuring a black child with a gun.

He
 described his views as ‘ultra-conservative’ and also said on his site 
that the ‘main thing in life’ was ‘making the world better’.

He listed shooting as an interest and is believed to have legally owned the firearms he used.

Hate-filled declaration: One of the images Vinogradov posted online in a manifesto several hours before his frenzied attack, vowing 'to destroy as many parts of the human compost as possible'

'I hate human society': Vinogradov posted on a Russian social site before the killings and described his views as 'ultra-conservative'

One of his favourite films was listed as Natural Born Killers. 

He
 hated television, describing it as the ‘sewage of human intellect’.  
His favourite quote is listed as ‘hope is the worst evil because it 
prolongs human suffering’ by Friedrich Nietzsche.

A police statement said: ‘Three men and two young women sitting at their desks died on the spot.

‘One more man and another young woman were wounded, they are receiving medical help.’

A source said: ‘He told investigators that he had fallen in love with a girl who was a pharmacist, but his feelings were not reciprocated.

‘Because of that he drank for five days and today he came in and opened fire.’

Another source said he would undergo psychological assessment. He said: ‘He is of course not Breivik but the analogy suggests itself.’

He graduated in 2009 from the Academic Law University in Moscow and worked as a company lawyer for the Rigla chain of pharmacies.
