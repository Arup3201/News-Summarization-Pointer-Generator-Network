A new graphic video recording has emerged showing a mentally ill Michigan man being shot at 46 times by eight police officers for refusing to drop a penknife during a standoff in 2012.

The killing of Milton Hall, 49, sparked a nationwide outcry and a federal investigation into allegations of police brutality, but the officers in question have been cleared of any wrongdoing.

At the time, Milton's mother, Jewel Hall, described the officers who shot dead her disturbed son as ‘a firing squad dressed in police uniforms.'

Gunned down: Milton Hall, 49, pictured left and right, was shot and killed by police officers during a confrontation in a Saginaw, Michigan, parking lot in July 2012 

New evidence: The ACLU has obtained this video recording showing eight police officers converging on the mentally distraught man armed with a penknife 

In their cross-hairs:  Hall, pictured pacing in front of the officers with their weapons drawn, was the one who called them after having a confrontation with a store clerk 

On Monday, the American Civil Liberties Union released a police dashcam video obtained from the victim’s family showing police officers converging on Milton Hall in a Saginaw parking lot and unleashing a volley of bullets at him.

The non-profit civil rights organization also published excerpts from an interview with Jewel Hall about her son's violent end.

Police in Saginaw said that on July 1, 2012, Milton Hall, a homeless man suffering from mental illness, called 911 after getting into a confrontation with a convenience store clerk.

The disturbing video obtained by ACLU shows the distraught man standing in a parking lot outside the store with a penknife in his hand, surrounded by eight uniformed police officers with their guns drawn.

Man down: Hall crumpled to the ground after being struck by 14 bullets, but the officers continued firing 

Arrest: The officers flipped over Hall's lifeless body and placed him in handcuffs 

Adding insult to injury: One of the cops appeared to have placed his foot on Hall's bullet-ridden back 

A K-9 officer is holding a German shepherd on a leash whose incessant barking provides a chilling soundtrack to the standoff.

A couple of minutes into the recording, the cops open fire on Hall. The 49-year-old man goes down in a hail of bullets and rolls over a couple of times as the officers continue firing on him.

After the gunfire stops, the cops converge on his lifeless, bullet-ridden body, flip him over and put him in handcuffs; a hulking Saginaw officer appears to place his foot on Hall's back.

'For him to be shot at 46 times and hit 14 times by all white policemen, it really raised questions in my mind,' Jewel Hall says in the ACLU interview. ‘How they circled him and assassinated him… his blood running down the street like water.

‘And he wasn't a threat, I mean, he had a little penknife. He had no idea that those policemen would do that to him.’

Mrs Hall said the 2012 shooting has been devastating to their family and the community at large.

Mother's grief: Jewel Hall told ACLU in an interview that her son was 'assassinated' by police 

Her pride and joy: Mrs Hall said before he was diagnosed with mental illness, Milton was a community organizer who fought for equal rights for people of color and the poor

Jewel Hall has expressed dismay over the fact that after a months-long investigation, the US Department of Justice concluded that the police shooting was not intentional.

The ACLU presented the new dashboard footage to the Organization of American States Monday in a bid to pressure the federal government to reopen Hall's case. 

The victim's mother said that before he was diagnosed with mental illness in his 20s, Milton Hall was a community organizer working to expose civil rights violations and promote equal rights for people of color and the poor.

‘He was always addressing institutional racism,’ she said. ‘I admired him for that.’

Saginaw County Prosecutor Michael Thomas told CNN in 2012 that the squad of police opened fire 'because apparently, at this point in time, he was threatening to assault police.'

According to Saginaw Police Chief Gerald Cliff, Hall was 'known to be an assaultive person' with 'a long history' of involvement with authorities, 'not only with police from our department but with the county.'
