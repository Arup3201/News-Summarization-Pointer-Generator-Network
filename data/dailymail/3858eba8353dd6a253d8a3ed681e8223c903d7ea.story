Italy's European Championship qualifier with Croatia at the San Siro was suspended after 75 minutes as Croatia fans threw flares and fireworks on to the San Siro pitch, leaving the stadium covered with smoke.

The referee marched the players down the tunnel with the score at 1-1 as the smoke continued to grow and riot police attempted to restrain the Croatian supporters. UEFA are expected to launch an investigation into the incidents at the San Siro in the coming days.

The players were off the field for 10 minutes before they returned to the pitch after emergency services extinguished and removed the flares. It was the second time in the match they had used flares, with some being thrown on during the first half as well - with the match interrupted for three minutes after Croatia scored.

Antonio Candreva had opened the scoring for Italy before Ivan Perisic equalised just four minutes later. The match eventually finished 1-1.

Speaking on ITV4, former Croatia boss Slaven Bilic said: 'It's (crowd trouble and flares being thrown) a big problem, not only in Croatia but definitely there.' 

Croatia and Italy are now level on 10 points at the top of 2016 European Championship qualifier Group H, with Norway just one behind.

The game itself was a pacey first-half which only slowed with the interruptions for the flares.

Italy were ahead after only 11 minutes when Candreva picked up the ball on the edge of the box and fired a low shot into the bottom left-hand corner of the net.

But Croatia responded just four minutes later. 

It was a blunder which led to the equaliser, as veteran goalkeeper Gianliugi Buffon let Perisic's shot go under his gloves and into the back of the net.

Unfortunately for Croatia, their play slowed once Luka Modric was taken off after 28 minutes with an injury.

The visitors were impressive, however, and enjoyed the bulk of possession at the San Siro on Sunday night.

Southampton's Graziano Pelle came on to make another appearance for Italy but he was unable to find a winner for the home side.

This match will unfortunately be remembered for the ugly scenes caused by the visiting supporters, however.
