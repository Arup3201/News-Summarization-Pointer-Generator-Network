The devastated family of the 62-year-old man who was snatched by a crocodile from a boat in Kakadu National Park were forced to drive for one hour off track before they could get help, Daily Mail Australia can reveal.

The three family members, from Darwin, had no phone reception as they witnessed the man get dragged into the water by a 4.7m long saltwater crocodile on Saturday, just after lunchtime, during a fishing trip.

They were on the boat with him at the Flying Fox waterhole, when he was grabbed by the beast as he leaned over the boat to wash or empty a bucket, the Northern Territory News reports.

The family, thought to be the man's wife, son and daughter-in-law, jumped into a 4x4 car and frantically drove the long drive to the nearest small town, Cooinda, to raise the alarm.

The man's remains were found inside one of two crocodiles, shot dead by officers in South Alligator River, in the Arnhem Land region of the Northern Territory, on Sunday.

A Northern Territory Police spokesperson told Daily Mail Australia that the family are 'too distraught' to give their statements about the attack at the moment.

More family members of the man have flown in from across Australia to comfort them.

The man's family, who have not been identified, had previously camped in Kakadu.

'I can only assume they (the family) are devastated,' a police spokesman said.

'The water is deep in this billabong...There is always the potential for a crocodile attack.'

The man was on board a boat outside crocodile-management zones patrolled by rangers when the unusual attack happened, sources say.

It is thought the family launched their boat in waters about 90 minutes by road from the Cooinda tourist centre.

Rangers reopened nearby waters for tourists on Saturday after successive patrols found no crocodiles.

Tourists are warned to beware of crocodiles in any part of Kakadu.

Phil Weeidemier, who runs Barra Tours - a company that organises fishing trips to the South Alligator River, told Daily Mail Australia: 'I've seen plenty of large crocs. You do play Russian roulette with your life up there.

'I've seen big fellas sitting at the back of their boats with their a**** hanging over in just 12 foot tinnies.

'They take their life into their own hands up there.'

Describing his own frightening encounters with the crocodiles, he added: 'I've been checking a motor on a boat and within seconds the crocs are surrounding you.

'It's the ones you don't see that you should worry about.'

He said that anyone visiting the South Alligator River should think twice about the size of the boat they are going in.

'If you go with a tour you are pretty safe but if you go on your own boat you need at least a 16ft boat.

'If you've got a few people on anything like a 14ft boat you are asking for trouble.

'When we catch Barramundi there we swing them over the boat and drag them alongside to get the water back in their gills before letting them go. That is dangerous. There are always several pairs of eyes watching.

'What this man was doing, I don't know.'

Jabiru Police, Gunbalanya Police, officers from the Water Police Section and Park Rangers continued their search for the man and the crocodile on Sunday morning after searching with spotlights through the night.

'At this time we have eight people down there and we'll be ramping that up if we don't locate the gentleman during the night,' NT police Superintendent Bob Harrison said on Saturday.

Northern Territory police were initially searching a billabong near the river at Kakadu National Park, but efforts were narrowed to the southern area of Alligator Creek, according to Nine News Darwin.

'Look we always hold out hope but obviously a crocodile attack is very serious and there are grave concerns,' Supt Harrison told ABC on Saturday.

'I believe the son was involved in the initial search for his father, which is obviously traumatising and anyone's heart would go out to the family in that sort of incident.'

Unless people who are snatched by crocodiles are found alive within the first minutes, officials admit there is very little chance of them surviving.

The family were being comforted by police and medical officials late last night.

Authorities are stunned by reports that the man had been grabbed by the crocodile while he was on a boat - a situation that is usually considered safe.

The man was attacked by a saltwater crocodile - one of the most feared and dangerous creatures on earth.

On Saturday night, Northern Territory Minister for Parks and Wildlife Bess Price said her thoughts were with the family and friends of the man.

The unusual incident happened on South Alligator River, near the town of Cooinda - about 300km east of Darwin

She also wished good luck and safety for the police and park rangers who were determined to continue searching for the man through the night in the slight chance that he has been able to get away from the reptile and swim to a river bank.

Cooinda is a popular tourist area in the heart of the World Heritage-listed Kakadu National Park - where the original Crocodile Dundee movie was shot.

The tiny township is on the banks of the Yellow Water Billabong, described as one of the world's most spectacular wetlands.

Cooinda is the main access point for the Yellow Water Cruise, which travels along Jim Jim Creek and the South Alligator River.

The area is particularly popular among bird watchers, but many tourists hope that they will be able to see crocodiles from the safety of their boat.
