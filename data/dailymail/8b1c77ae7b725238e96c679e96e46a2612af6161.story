David Cameron quipped today that his daughter Nancy wants to be an Olympian so that she can run after the family car next time he leaves her in the pub.

His joke comes a couple of weeks after it emerged that the Prime Minister and his wife left their daughter at a pub in Buckinghamshire when they returned to Chequers.

The couple had left in separate cars both believing the other had Nancy with them - leaving their eight-year-old daughter at the pub.

The Prime Minister today joked about 
the incident two months ago, telling an audience at Loughborough 
University: 'My daughter said yesterday "Dad, when I grow up I want to 
be an Olympian".

'I don’t know what sport she’s 
choosing - presumably if I leave her in the pub again the 100m to catch 
up with the car before it heads off into the distance.'

The Camerons were with their other 
children Arthur, six, and 22-month-old Florence, and two other families 
when Nancy wandered off to the toilets as the group was leaving the 
Plough Inn in Cadsden, Buckinghamshire.

The Prime Minister was driven back to
Chequers, which is two miles from the pub, with protection officers in 
one car, while Mrs Cameron drove their other children in another.

Once her absence was noticed when the Camerons got home they phoned the pub and Nancy was found safe and well.

When Mr Cameron arrived back at the 
pub he found his daughter happily helping the pub staff. It is 
understood she had been left by herself for 15 minutes.

A spokesman for the Prime Minister 
said: 'Thankfully when they phoned the pub she was there safe and well. 
The Prime Minister went down straight away to get her.’

Plough landlord Steve Hollings, who 
has run the pub with his wife Sharon for more than 13 years, said the 
Prime Minister and his family regularly pop in for lunch or drinks.

The Swan Pub, near his country 
retreat at Chequers, now has a poster which says 'Please ensure you have
all your children with you when you leave'.

The Prime Minister made the joke 
during a speech about the legacy of the London Games to an audience at 
the university, where the preparation camp for Team GB is housed.

Every Olympic athlete will at some 
point pass through the university to pick up their kit, and Mr Cameron 
today met some of the athletes following his speech.

He was shown some of the official 
2012 kit that Team GB athletes will wear, as well as some older attire 
from past Olympic Games.

Mr Cameron met Luol Deng, the 6ft 9in
NBA star of the Chicago Bulls who will head up the men’s Team GB squad,
along with other members of the team.

He talked to Deng about a link they both share in the form of the American president.

Mr Cameron told him: 'I’ve been 
really looking forward to meeting you because we’ve got a mutual friend 
in Barack Obama. He’s a big fan of yours.'

He also asked Deng about the squad’s 
upcoming Olympic matches, and explained how Mr Obama gave him some tips 
when the pair watched Mississippi Valley State University play Western 
Kentucky University in Dayton, Ohio.

The world leaders took front row 
seats for the opening game in the March Madness tournament, which saw 
Western Kentucky storm to a 59-56 victory in the final few minutes.

Mr Cameron told Deng: 'I had a lesson from Obama.

'Actually it was a terrible game and I
was quite enjoying it and he said: ‘This is a terrible game. I’m so 
sorry I’ve brought you here, you’ve got to see a better game.’

'He gave me a great explanation 
although I still find it difficult to understand when you’ve done a foul
and when you’ve haven’t done a foul.

'It’s hard enough in football but in your sport it’s so complicated.'
