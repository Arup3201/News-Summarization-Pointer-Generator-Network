For all those whose New Years resolution was to travel more, you're in luck.

This month, hotel prices in key European destinations have fallen dramatically - in some cases, reaching their lowest in the past four years.

This includes such popular cities as Rome, Berlin, Barcelona and Nordic destinations, like Stockholm, Copenhagen and Oslo. 

This month, hotel prices in key European destinations, like Rome (pictured), have fallen dramatically

According to the trivago Hotel Price Index (tHPI), which is reported monthly, 21 of the 50 most popular European cities are at a record low.

A hotel stay in Rome during the month of January could cost as little as £78 per night, while Berlin is even cheaper, coming in at just £68 for a room per night.

And while some destinations are currently boasting their lowest hotel prices in four years, many more are also seeing their lowest prices in the past 12 months.

When prices for this month are compared to the most expensive month of 2014, savings of up to 60 per cent are available in some places.

Reaching its lowest price in months, a hotel room in Berlin costs as little as £68 in January 

Among those cities with the biggest drop in price are Edinburgh, Venice and Barcelona

In Barcelona, a hotel room will run just £72 this month, compared to a hefty £131 price tag in May 2014

Out of the 50 most popular destinations in Europe on trivago, Edinburgh and Venice offer the greatest percentage difference this month.

Usually considered one of the most expensive cities in Europe, a hotel in Venice will cost just £97 this month, compared to £231 in May 2014. 

This massive difference in both month-on-month and -year-on-year costs suggests a general trend of falling hotel prices.

Of the 50 most popular European destinations on trivago, Edinburgh offers the greatest price difference: 60%

17 of 22 popular European cities have seen a price drop when compared to January 2014 costs

Usually considered to be one of the most expensive cities, a hotel in Venice ranks at just £97 this month

The lowest month-on-month decreases can be found in Dresden, Prague and London, while the largest year-on-year decreases will benefit those looking to travel to Riga, Warsaw and Bucharest.

In fact, Prague has experienced a 20 per cent drop compared to last month and 14 per cent compared to last year, making it the prime time to visit. 

Denise Bartlett, of trivago's UK Public Relations says: 'January is always a cheap month for European hotel stays, with temperatures at their lowest in many locations and prices falling after the Christmas and New Year period. 

'However, with both year-on-year decreases and many destinations at their lowest in four years, a general trend of falling hotel prices is extremely likely.

'Large savings can be made by travelling this month – some of the destinations at their lowest since January 2011 are typically among the most expensive in Europe - Stockholm, Copenhagen and Oslo, for example.'
