Barcelona trained once more at St. Georges Park on Wednesday as they continue their pre-season preparations at the home of English football.

On a pristine practice pitch at the state-of-the-art complex, new manager Luis Enrique put his side through a relaxed warm-up, beginning with some low intensity shuttle runs before the players divided into pairs to sharpen up their passing.

In front of the watching England women's team, midfield maestros Xavi and Andres Iniesta pinged short and long range passes to one another, the two metronomes dropping the ball on a six-pence, while new signing Ivan Rakitic linked up with his Croatian compatriot Alen Halilovic.

The most intriguing sight, however, was the competition developing between the two new goalkeepers signed by Luis Enrique to replace Victor Valdes and Jose Pinto after the two long-serving stoppers exited the Nou Camp at the end of last season.

Marc-André Ter Stegen, signed from Borussia Monchengladbach in May and rated as one of the world's finest young goalkeepers at the age of 22, will challenge former Real Sociedad goalkeeper Claudio Bravo, the 31-year old Chilean whose star shone so brightly at the World Cup.

The pair - along with Jordi Masip, who has been promoted from the Barcelona B setup after graduating through the La Masia academy - were put through an intensive workout by goalkeeping specialist José Ramon de la Fuente, plucking crosses out of the air and demonstrating their reflexes with as a round of quick-fire shots came streaming in.

It is understood that Ter Stegen will begin the season as the club's No. 1 goalkeeper but Bravo, with over 80 caps with Chile to his name, will offer stiff resistance and Enrique may be tempted to plump for his experience as the season develops.

One player who will not to be training at St George's Park is former Liverpool striker Luis Suarez who joined the Catalan club for £75million but is currently serving a four-month ban from all football as punishment for biting Giorgio Chiellini at the World Cup on June 24.
