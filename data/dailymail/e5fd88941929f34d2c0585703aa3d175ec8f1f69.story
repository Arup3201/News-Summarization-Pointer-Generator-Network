Stuart Hogg hasn’t had his troubles to seek over the past few months. First, the talented full-back was sent-off against Wales during the Six Nations earlier this year before then falling out of favour at Glasgow Warriors to such an extent that he wasn’t even in their squad for the Pro12 Final against Leinster.

Question-marks were inevitably raised over his attitude and focus, with rumours of a big-money move to Ulster unhelpful to say the least at the business end of the domestic season.

Yet, as is so often the case in sport, one moment of brilliance on the field of play can pave the way for a brighter future off the park.

On Saturday night — local time — Hogg made a mockery of the searing heat and humidity of Houston to issue a timely reminder of his talent in Vern Cotter’s first match in charge of Scotland.

With 13 minutes left of the Scots’ first match of their summer tour, against the USA, the 21-year-old from Hawick took a high ball 50 metres out.

Lesser players would have kicked for touch or played it inside to a team-mate to conserve energy in the 30 degree heat and 84 per cent humidity. Not many would have attempted to run the length of the pitch in such testing conditions.

With team-mate Tim Visser shouting at him to ‘run into the space’, Hogg took off — leaving the stunned and tired Americans in his wake.

And, after the 21-times capped full-back touched down, the sweet release of frustration from the Scot was palpable.

‘I kept running and running but I felt I was going nowhere, like I was being pulled back with an anchor because it was so hot and humid out there,’ said Hogg, nursing a broken nose that makes him a doubt for the match against Canada in Toronto next Saturday.

‘You may not believe me but give me the rain and wind of Scotstoun over those conditions in Houston any day.

‘When I did manage to get to the line, I think you saw what the try meant to me.

‘After what I have been through to be back on the pitch, to score a try and to be part of a winning Scotland team was a great feeling.

‘It had been a tough time for me because, if I am honest, what happened in Wales when I got sent off (after an unnecessary shoulder charge on Dan Biggar) knackered my whole season.

‘I won’t be doing that again in a hurry because I let a lot of people down in that game but I’m trying hard to get them all back on my side now.

‘It has been a frustrating time but I am settled at Glasgow and unless you are aware of something I am not, then I will definitely be at the Warriors next season.’

Although Scotland should have won by a greater margin, the fact they were never in trouble defensively would have pleased their new head coach, Cotter.

Apart from Hogg’s moment of brilliance, the four new caps — openside Blair Cowan, stand-off Finn Russell and props Alex Allan and Gordon Reid — played well and gave hope for the future.

The most assured was certainly 21-year-old Russell, who only broke into the Glasgow Warriors team after Christmas.

How Visser could have done with some of his young team-mate’s composure.

The winger hadn’t played for Scotland since breaking his leg last October and although he scored one very good try off a Greig Laidlaw pass, he could have had more.

Three times, he fluffed his lines — fumbling what should have been a scoring pass from Cowan, dropping the ball over the line on another occasion before then taking the wrong option when put in by Russell.

Thankfully, those missed opportunities did not come back to haunt the Scots in a match which will be remembered for being Cotter’s first game in charge, if little else.

In truth, the crowd of 21,000 — many of them ex-pats Scots — never had much to shout about.

Yet, there was a real intensity about Scotland’s early play.

Cotter, in first pre-match address, must have really got them fired up in the dressing room as they didn’t give the USA a second on the ball before a massive tackle would come in.

Early on, it was Reid, Jim Hamilton and Alasdair Strokosch who were fulfilling the role of enforcer as the poor Americans were stuck in their own half for long periods.

Scotland had taken the lead through Greig Laidlaw’s second penalty, after his first effort had hit the upright, and never looked like losing it.

Chris Wyles, the USA full-back, did draw the scores level after Johnnie Beattie was penalised only for Scotland to then grab their first try of the match.

It was a simple affair with Laidlaw running round the ruck undefended before popping a pass to Visser, who ran in between the posts. The Scotland captain put over the conversion.

There was little free-flowing rugby being played because the Scots knew that they had the better of the USA at the scrum and kept resorting to it whenever possible.

The tactic paid off when, around the 30-minute mark, Scotland had a series of scrums on the opposition line only for the home side to continually collapse them.

The patience of French referee Pascale Gauzere finally snapped and, after sending American prop Olive Kilifi to the sin bin, he awarded a penalty try. Laidlaw once again put over the conversion.

Moments later, in their first attack, USA captain Todd Clever thought he had gone over but the TMO deemed he had taken two movements before touching down. Replays suggested it had been a harsh decision, however.

Ordinarily, to go in 17-3 at the break away from home would have been a cause for celebration but the points difference should have much more. Against a better nation, the opportunities missed by players such as Visser would have come back to haunt Scotland.

In the second half, the Americans did enjoy more possession and territory but never got near the Scotland try line. The only points they got once again came from the boot of Wyles, who put over a penalty.

With the result a foregone conclusion, the intensity of the match faded in the heat and humidity, with mistakes creeping into the play of both sides.

Scotland looked tired and it was no surprise when Cotter made a string of substitutions on the hour mark, although even these changes didn’t spark the game into life.

It took Hogg’s lung-busting run up the touchline to bring the Houston crowd to their feet.

For the American fans, this was what rugby was all about. A brave full-back running from deep to score a wonderful try.

It certainly brightened up a dull last 10 minutes and the fact that the match ended with Russell dropping the ball and kicking it away in frustration summed up the general quality of play by both sides.

By the same token, the win for Cotter means that, here in Houston, we have lift-off on his time in charge of Scotland. Next up is Canada in Toronto, who are likely to provide a much tougher test.
