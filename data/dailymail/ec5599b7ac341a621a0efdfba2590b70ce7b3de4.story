Dressing up for Halloween is all about standing out.

Sure, you can transform yourself into a witch, a ghost or vampire, but you will simply be 'fitting in' with the others. 

Did you ever think to go as a Transformer?

In these two incredible videos, two people show off their super effort in dressing up for the occasion, one as Bumblebee, and the other as a variation of Road Rocket from the hit comic book-turned-megafilm franchise.

Standing outside the Court of The Two Sisters restaurant in New Orleans, US, this Brazilian entertainer waits for passers-by to drop some change into his collection bucket, before he transforms in Bumblebee.

The Brazilian designer is transformed to ground vehicle in a matter of seconds, and circles the bucket

It really is magical to see as in a matter of seconds man in costume is now an 'Autobot', setting off on four wheels, circling the bucket, before coming to a halt, and standing up.

But the onlookers are spoilt, and the designer battens down the bonnet and goes to ground once again, giving another circle before returning to base.

The design of the child's outfit is perfect as he looks all set to speed off

It's time for action as the Transformer comes into shot, and shows off his tools

Not to be outdone, this child may not be old enough to drive, but he can turn himself into a motorcycle with an ingenious design.

Akin to Transformer Road Rocket, the young boy scoots along on one wheel to the sound of an engine running, before going to ground and transforming into a motorbike.

A few pumps of the gas pedal and this speedster is ready for the off - sadly we don't get to see him shoot off on a mission.
