Ronny Deila has pledged to find a fix for John Guidetti’s confidence crisis after the Swede was the chief striking sinner in a shock Celtic stalemate with Ross County.

The on-loan Manchester City man’s grim form in front of goal continued with another blank and a bad second-half miss in 0-0 draw.

That’s five games without netting for the erstwhile self-assured forward who burst on to the Scottish scene with 11 goals in 10 appearances.

John Guidetti failed to score for the fifth consecutive game during the 0-0 draw against Ross County

Deila admitted that Guidetti, who has been substituted in every game of his drought, now needs help to overcome the surprise slump as Celtic prepare for a Glasgow derby against Partick Thistle on Thursday.

‘He is struggling at the moment, you can see that,’ said Deila. ‘His ambitions are very high and he is even more disappointed than everyone else.

‘The only people who can do something about that is us. So we have to work hard in training every day and see what we can do to get it going.

‘We know that he can score goals, he has done it before. He hasn’t become a much worse player in a month, it is just small details that we are going to have to turn around.

‘He will come back. My challenge — and his as well — would be get that back as quickly as possible.’

Despite the first scoreless league draw in over three years at Parkhead, Celtic extended their title lead to five points over Dundee United.

However, Deila’s bid to build on that advantage for the remainder of the festive period could be undermined by an injury to Anthony Stokes.

The Irishman suffered a calf strain nine minutes into yesterday’s game and Deila was unsure of the striker’s prospects of facing Thistle or Kilmarnock next Monday night.

Deila will be hoping the surfaces on their travels, including the artificial one at Rugby Park, is better than the one at Parkhead that he feels is not currently conducive to his preferred style of play.

‘The pitch is not 100 per cent right now so we have to use one extra touch and the attacks get slower,’ he complained. ‘It’s a bit bumpy but that is not an excuse, we should have created a lot more.

‘If you can get an early goal it is important as well, they have to attack and try to lose something and there is a bit more space.

‘In the end it was a lack of creativity and tempo.’
