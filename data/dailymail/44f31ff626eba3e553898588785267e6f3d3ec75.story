A mailman in Long Island has been arrested for throwing out more than 1,000 pieces of mail at a mix of four different trash sites in the span of a week.

Patrick Paskett, 24, was arrested and has been charged with mail destruction which is considered a felony and could lead to five years in prison.

The investigation was prompted by residents in Seaford and Massapequa Park complaining that they were not receiving packages that they knew had been sent.

Something wrong in the small town: Residents of Seaford and Massapequa Park in Long Island noticed that their mail was not being delivered in the first week of March and alerted authorities

'It happened. I resigned. I don’t work for them anymore. It’s over,' Paskett told The New York Post.

Technically he is still employed with the United States Postal Service until the case is finished, but he is no longer delivering mail.

The investigation focused on the mail that he dumped between February 27 and March 6 but The Post reports that he admitted to throwing mail in trash bins about 15 times in the last three months.

After the complaints from residents were reported to authorities, a federal agent was assigned to track Paskett's movements on March 6, though it is unclear how they were able to limit the scope of their investigation to just Paskett and not others who covered similar areas.

Once confronted, Paskett showed where he discarded the stamped mail and investigators were able to recover 1,018 letters and packages that he threw out between February 27 and March 6.

'The defendant, Patrick Paskett, further stated, in sum and substance, that he knew it was wrong to throw away mail,' a criminal complaint filed with Brooklyn Federal Court reads.

Paskett was released on his own recognizance but faces a possible five year sentence.

'Very, very bad- I mean, people ar waiting for their checks; people are waiting for their bills, and it's very bad,' Massapequa Park resident Christine Augello told CBS New York.

'He should have never done that.'

His court date has not been set but he will be staying at his parents' home, where he lives, until the trial.
