The death toll from a suspected suicide bombing in Pakistan's commercial capital Karachi on Sunday has risen to 45, a senior city official said.

Hashim Raza also said 149 people were wounded in the attack outside a Shi'ite mosque, the latest signal that Sunni groups are escalating sectarian bombings against the minority.

The bomb exploded outside a Shi'ite mosque as people were leaving evening prayers, said police official Azhar Iqbal. Men, women and children were among those killed and wounded, he said.

No one has yet claimed responsibility for the bomb, but it signals an escalation in attacks targeted at the Shiite minority

Witness Mariam Bibi said: 'It's like doomsday to me. I was watching television when I heard an explosion and my flat was badly shaken.

'I saw people burning to death and crying with pain. I saw children lying in pools of their own blood and women running around shouting for their children and loved ones.'

Another witness, Ali Reza, said: 'The explosion was so massive it jolted the entire area. Two flats and nearby shops caught fire after the explosion and balconies of various buildings collapsed.'

It is feared people have become trapped in the rubble of buildings that collapsed in the bombing.

No
one has claimed responsibility, but Sunni militants linked to al-Qaeda 
and the Taliban have targeted Shi'ites in the past, claiming they are 
heretics.

Initial reports 
suggest the bomb was rigged to a motorcycle, although a survey of the 
damage indicates there could have been additional explosives planted at 
the scene, the police official said.

It is not yet known which group is responsible for the explosion, which caused flames to engulf the building

Injured victims are carried away from the scene of the attack where 45 people died and 149 were wounded

'I heard a huge blast. I saw flames,' 
Syed Irfat Ali, a resident of the area, said, adding that people were 
crying and running to safety.

Sunni
militant groups have stepped up attacks in the past year against Shi'ite
Muslims who make up about 20 per cent of Pakistan's population of 180 
million people.

Two brazen
attacks against a Shi'ite Hazara community in south western city of 
Quetta have killed nearly 200 people since January 10.

Pakistani
militant group Lashkar-e-Jhangvi claimed responsibility for those 
bombings, which ripped through a billiard club and a market in areas 
populated by Hazaras, which are mostly Muslim Shi'ites.

It is feared many more victims are trapped in the rubble of the building which collapsed after the explosion

Pakistan's
intelligence agencies helped nurture Sunni militant groups like 
Lashkar-e-Jhangvi in the 1980s and 1990s to counter a perceived threat 
from neighboring Iran, which is mostly Shiite.

Pakistan banned Lashkar-e-Jhangvi in 2001, but the group continues to attack Shi'ites.

According
to Human Rights Watch, more than 400 Shi'ites were killed last year in 
targeted attacks across the country, the worst year on record for 
anti-Shi'ite violence in Pakistan.

The human rights group said more than 125 were killed in Baluchistan province. Most of them belonged to the Hazara community.

Human rights groups have accused the government of not doing enough to protect Shi'ites.

After
the January 10 bombing, the Hazara community held protests, which 
spread to other parts of the country. The protesters refused to bury 
their dead for several days while demanding a military-led crackdown 
against the Lashkar-e-Jhanvi group.

Rescuers will continue to search through rubble for victims who may be trapped under the collapsed building

Chaos unfolds after the bomb attack as the death toll of Shiites killed since January totals nearly 350

Pakistan's president dismissed the provincial government and assigned a governor to run Baluchistan province. No operation was launched against the militant group until another bombing in February killed 89 people.

The government then ordered a police operation and has said some members of the group have been arrested.

One of the founders of the group, Malik Ishaq, was among those detained and officials said he could be questioned to determine if his group is linked to the latest violence against Shi'ites. Â
