A man with no arms or legs has made history by swimming across four intercontinental channels after losing all four limbs when he was severely electrocuted.

French athlete Philippe Croizon finished the final stage of his marathon swim last Friday, swimming the two mile channel in arctic waters between Alaska and Russia in extreme conditions.

The 44-year-old, who had never swum before,  is only the second person to swim the Bering Strait.

He will now travel to London to be a French commentator at the Paralympic Games.

Amputee makes history: Philippe Croizon, right, has swum all four intercontinental channels with swimming partner Arnaud Chausserie, left, after all four limbs were amputated when he was electrocuted

Arriving in Russia along with swimming partner Arnaud Chausserie last Friday, Croizon has now swum all four channels that link the world’s five continents of Oceania, Asia, Europe, Africa, and America.

The final leg of their journey, the Bering Strait, was the shortest of their swims but the toughest as they swum through three degree Celsius water, six foot swells and heavy fog.

Croizon became a quadruple amputee when he was severely electrocuted by a 20,000 volt charge while he attempted to install a television antenna on his roof in 1994.

The burns to his limbs were so bad that they all had to be amputated but after hitting ‘rock bottom’ he was determined to set himself a seemingly impossible task.

Toughest swim: While it was the shortest swim, the two mile channel, Bering Strait, was the hardest with arctic waters, six foot swell and heavy fog

Making a splash: Croizon rests on the shore in the coastal village of Pasar Skow located in Indonesia after completing his swim from Oceania to Asia which took seven-and-a-half hours in May

Wetsuit mishap: Croizon swum from Papua New Guinea to Indonesia in a customised wetsuit, pictured, but on the final journey, his specifically designed wetsuit for the arctic water did not fit and he was forced to wear a thin wetsuit in the icy water

Speaking through his translator Marc Gaviard, Croizon said: ‘The idea was to bring able-bodied and people with disabilities together and prove that having a disability doesn't have to stop you achieving what you want.

‘I hit rock bottom after the accident so I wanted to set myself a big challenge and I decided I should hope for the impossible.

‘Whilst we should look at our differences we should also look at our similarities in what we can achieve.’

From America to Asia: The journey from Alaska's Little Diomede Island to the Russian maritime border near Big Diomede Island, measured about two miles and took the swimmer about an hour and 15 minutes

Stranded during storm: The swimming pair were stranded on Little Diomede Island in Alaska for four days while they waited for a storm to pass before completing their remarkable journey

Not long after his accident, Croizon was inspired after watching an American woman swim the English Channel.

Using specially adapted artificial legs fitted with giant flippers, Croizon became the first quadruple amputee to cross the 21-mile English Channel in 13.5 hours in 2010.

After he crossed the channel he put his elaborate plan to swim all four intercontinental channels into action, dubbed ‘Swimming Beyond Borders’.

He arrived in Alaska three weeks ago to adapt to the harsh weather conditions and during the last swim the pair were stranded on Alaska’s Little Diomede Island for four days while they waited for a storm to pass. 

Croizon also risked getting hypothermia because he had to wear a thin wetsuit after his customised one did not fit properly.

He said: ‘The final stage of the challenge in Alaska was the hardest thing I've ever had to do because the weather conditions were so bad so I was very exhausted when we finished.

‘Water is soothing for me and a much better environment for my body compared to being in a wheelchair.

‘I've got no plans for any big challenges in the near future but “never say never” but now I'm going to get some sleep.’

Exhausted but soothing: Croizon said the last swim was the most challenging but that the water is soothing and much better than being in his wheelchair
