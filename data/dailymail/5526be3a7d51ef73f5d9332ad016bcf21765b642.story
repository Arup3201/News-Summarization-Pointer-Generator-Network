Ten children a day are suspended or expelled from school because of incidents involving weapons including knives, air guns, chisels and knuckledusters.

Pupils and teachers were threatened or attacked in a string of incidents over the past year, some involving pepper spray and razor blades, a disturbing survey has found.

In Essex, a pupil took a knife to school and held it to another child’s throat. Another pupil was expelled for throwing a fire extinguisher at a headmaster.

A survey has revealed that ten children are being kicked out of school every day for bringing weapons to school, with most coming from London (file picture)

A child in Leicester stole the emergency hammer from a school minibus and threatened fellow pupils with it.

And in Birmingham, pupils were disciplined for bringing machetes, knives and pepper spray to school. One student was expelled for whipping his teacher with a rope, while another attacked a fellow student with a knuckleduster.

In West Sussex, a student was suspended after attacking two pupils with a chisel. In Croydon, South London, a pupil shot another with a BB air gun.

A survey of councils in England after a Freedom of Information request found 57 out of 150 had received reports from local schools of pupils excluded temporarily or permanently for incidents involving weapons, many of them potentially lethal. Altogether last year there were 594 incidents.

But only a third of councils hold this information as they are not required to by the Department for Education, so across the country the total would be around 1,800 – or ten children per school day.

Academies and free schools do not supply information about incidents at school to their council.

Chris McGovern, chairman of the 
Campaign for Real Education and a former state school history teacher 
and headmaster of a successful prep school, said: ‘Schools should be 
safe and secure places for staff and pupils.

'Where
 violence reigns, self-preservation, not education, is the order of the 
day. The fact is there are few deterrents for delinquent kids.

Former headteacher Chris McGovern, said that while violence is coming into schools, self-preservation gets in the way of education

‘A child who is a danger to others in school should be educated in an isolation unit until we can be fairly sure that he or she no longer poses a threat.’

The greatest number of violent incidents at schools during the 2012/13 academic year – by both adults and children – was in London which had 112, followed by 14 in the West Midlands.

Tower Hamlets council in East London had a report of a pupil coming to school armed with four replica guns and ammunition.

The Daily Mail revealed earlier this year that 40 primary school pupils are expelled for attacking staff every day. There were 8,000 expulsions in just one year – a 15 per cent rise in 12 months.

A spokesman for the Department for Education said: ‘It is totally unacceptable for pupils to threaten other pupils and teachers with weapons.

‘That is why we have put  teachers back in charge of  discipline. Teachers can now issue no-notice detentions, search pupils without consent for weapons, and use force to remove disruptive pupils from the classroom.’

However only a third of local authorities keep track of this data

Across the country that could mean up to 1,800 exclusions, ten a day
