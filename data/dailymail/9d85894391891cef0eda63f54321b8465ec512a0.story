Labour today comfortably held Feltham and Heston in the by-election with an increased majority over the Conservatives.

Labour candidate Seema Malhotra was returned with a majority of 6,203 - a net swing of 8.6 per cent from the Conservatives.

On a night which saw a turnout of under 29 per cent - the lowest in a by-election for 11 years - the Liberal Democrats managed to see off a challenge from the UK Independence Party to hold on to third place.

The result came as a relief to Labour leader Ed Miliband who needed a victory if he was not to face a fresh bout of questioning over his leadership.

He hailed the by-election success as a 'verdict on the Government's failed economic plan'.

Addressing supporters in Feltham town centre, Mr Miliband called on the Tories to 'listen' to voters.

He said: 'I think it is pretty offensive that the Conservatives are saying this morning "Well, what do you expect? It's a traditional Labour area".

'They shouldn't be denying the people's choice, they should be listening to the people's verdict.

'I think that is one of the things people really don't like about this government - that they don't listen. They really need to start listening.

The triumphant candidate said her victory is a 'wake-up call' for Prime Minister David Cameron.

Important message: Ms Malhotra delivers her winning speech as the unsuccessful candidates, Lib Dem Roger Crouch (centre) and Tory Mark Bowen (head bowed), listen on at the Civic Centre in Hounslow, west London

Ms Malhotra said: 'Even on a lower turnout we've increased substantially our majority and the Tories have got to be asking the question of why.

'This is a really important message that's been sent to Mr Cameron.'

The Conservatives however said Labour
 should have extended their majority even further if they were looking 
to be on course for victory at the next general election, set for 2015.

The defeated Tory candidate Mark Bowen insisted that he was 'proud' of the result, despite seeing his party's share of the vote fall.

'We have done a lot better than the pollsters and bookmakers suggested we would do,' he said.

For the Lib Dems there was relief that they avoided the humiliation of being beaten into fourth place, despite a sharp fall in their share of the vote.

Delight: Supporters celebrate Ms Malhotra's victory, which increased Labour's share of the vote from 43per cent at the general election to 54per cent

Lib Dem candidate Roger Crouch said: 'We have shown that we are still resilient and still relevant.'

However Ukip leader Nigel Farage said the Lib Dems were 'almost a busted flush'.

'People are turning to Ukip as they realise we are serious when it comes to putting Britain first,' he said.

Ukip had been hoping to overhaul the Lib Dems but admitted their chances had been damaged by David Cameron's decision to wield the veto at the Brussels summit, which gave the Tories a fillip in the final week of the campaign.

Labour increased their share of the vote from 43per cent at the general election to 54per cent with a net swing of 8.6per cent from the Tories.

The Conservative vote share was down from 34per cent to 28per cent, while the Lib Dems dropped from nearly 14per cent to under 6per cent.

In contrast, Ukip saw its vote share more than double from 2per cent to over 5per cent.

The parliamentary by-election was sparked by the death last month of veteran Labour MP Alan Keen after he lost his battle with cancer.
