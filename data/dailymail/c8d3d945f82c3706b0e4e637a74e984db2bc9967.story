A Liberian orphan has been separated from his younger sisters after his adoption by an American family was put on hold due to the deadly Ebola outbreak.

Tessa and Joel Sanborn from Maple Valley in Washington, were due to take five-year-old Devine back to their home just outside of Seattle in December after adopting his twin sisters Faith and Favor.

The couple were previously allowed to take the two-year-old twins from the Acres of Hope children's home in Liberia as Faith had a stroke at birth and needed medical attention and Favor was allowed to travel with her.

Faith is currently receiving therapy to strengthen the use of her right hand and foot.

But Devine had to be left behind in Liberia, and because a state of emergency continues in the country as they try to contain the Ebola threat his adoption is on hold indefinitely.

Fighting back the tears, Mrs Sanborn, who also has six other children, said: 'We love Liberia, and we want what's best for the country as a whole.

'It's never a place a parent wants to be.'

Patricia Anglin, the director and founder of the Acres of Hope orphange where Devine is currently living is constantly updating his new parents of his progress.

Director of the orphanage where Devine is living says he asks everyday when he can join his American family 

She said: 'He's, I guess, doing as well as can be expected, but every day, asks, "When do I get to go? When do I get to go to America and be with my family?"'

'Those children that have extended families, some of those extended families are afraid to reach out to them.

'Often times, the traditional thinking is that those children will always be contagious.'

The deadly virus has caused the number of children in west African orphanages to increase and aid workers say many are struggling to cope with the influx as well as a shortage of food and supplies.

It is estimated 7,000 children in Liberia, Sierra Leone and Guinea have lost one or more parent to the disease.

Ms Anglin says that many of the staff at her organisation have now stopped taking a salary as funds are so low and they desperately need to raise money.

She added: 'Long after Ebola is even eradicated, we will have the devastation and challenges left behind of these orphans who need to be cared for.

'We can't do it alone.'

Liberia used to be a major partner with U.S. adoption agencies, but the situation has changed recently due to complications unrelated to Ebola.

According to State Department figures, there were only 12 adoptions from Liberia by Americans in 2013, down from a high of 353 in 2006.

However, experts on international adoptions caution that disasters and emergencies, such as the Ebola crisis, should not be occasions to hastily encourage adoptions.

Najwa Mekki of UNICEF explained: 'The first priority is to reunite children with their close relatives or other community members willing to look after them

Meanwhile in Guinea: Health workers from the Red Cross carry the body of a victim of Ebola in Momo Kanedou on November 19. Guinea, along with Liberia and Sierra Leone, have been hardest hit by Ebola, which has claimed nearly 5,200 lives this year, according to the latest WHO figures

'Children are never more vulnerable than in the contexts of large-scale emergencies. Making permanent decisions about children's long-term care should be kept to an absolute minimum during this period.'

The Joint Council on International Children's Services, a Virginia-based child-advocacy organisation whose partners include many U.S. adoption agencies, has also taken a similar stance, as has the State Department.

Spokesman Niles Cole added: 'We want to avoid the situation where adoptive parents go through the process and then are disappointed.'
