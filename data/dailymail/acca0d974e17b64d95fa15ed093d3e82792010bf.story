him at the corner of Wood St and 51st before turning north and shooting 
up the park.

'They
 hit the light pole next to me but I ducked down and ran into the 
house,' Harris said.

'They've been coming round here looking for people 
to shoot every night -- just gang-banging stuff. It's what they do.'
