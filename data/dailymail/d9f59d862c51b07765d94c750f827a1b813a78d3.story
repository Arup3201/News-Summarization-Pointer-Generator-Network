It might not seem the best place to set up home but this mother goose has done exactly that – and set up her nest right in the middle of a busy dual carriageway.

The Greylag goose has bedded down in the shrubbery on the Castle Mills Bridge in York, just inches away from busy fast-flowing traffic.

While the expectant mother may have chosen the camouflaged spot to lay her young, the welfare of her goslings when they hatch has become a cause for concern.

Anne Pyrah, from Selby Wildlife Rescue Centre in Barlby, North Yorkshire, said: 'My concern is that cars will swerve to avoid them if a chick is on the road'

All wild birds are protected by the Wildlife and Countryside Act 1981 which states that none should be harmed nor should their nests be moved or interfered with.

Annette Pyrah, from Selby Wildlife Rescue Centre in Barlby, North Yorkshire, is worried the nest could cause problems for both the nesting bird and passing motorists.

She said: ‘My concern is that cars will swerve to avoid them if a gosling is on the road.

‘By law we can't move the nest but she must be resourceful to have built it there anyway.

‘It's the perfect nesting area really, apart from the fact that it's between two roads.

‘She is camouflaged and there is lots of shrubbery which makes it an inviting nesting place.’

Ms Pyrah said that numerous people, 
including drivers, have called her with concerns - but said that until 
the eggs hatch there is little the wildlife group can do.

She said: 'People have been ringing me up because they are so concerned about her. One lady called me and told me she got out of her car to stop traffic to help the goose.

'Once all the eggs are hatched, the mother goose has got to try and get her goslings safely across the road.

'Will cars stop or swerve for them? It’s not ideal.

'The council should have a think about making it less attractive for them to nest there. It’s thick shrubbery at the moment which is ideal for them to hide in.'

The Wildlife and Countryside Act 1981 states that all wild birds are protected.

A part of the act dictates that a person must not intentionally damage, destroy or take the nest of any wild bird while it is in use or being built, or intentionally or recklessly disturb certain wild birds or their dependent young while they are at or near to an active nest site.

Many passing motorists have become concerned for the welfare of the expectant Greylag goose which is expected to stay in its current nesting place until all eggs have hatched

The Wildlife and Countryside Act 1981 states that all wild birds are protected.

The act makes it an offence to intentionally:

The Act also prohibits certain methods of killing, injuring, or taking birds, restricts the sale and possession of captive bred birds, and sets standards for keeping birds in captivity.

It also makes it an offence to intentionally or recklessly kill, injure or take any wild and prohibits interference with places used for shelter or protection, or intentionally disturbing animals occupying such places.
