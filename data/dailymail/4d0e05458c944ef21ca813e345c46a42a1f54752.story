Casey Kasem's daughter has asked a judge to let her move terminally-ill father to a nursing home in Los Angeles - just days after taking custody of him from his second wife Jean.

In a court filing, Kerri Kasem says the 82-year-old broadcast icon needs the attention of skilled nursing care.

Doctors say he has only six months to live and is afflicted with Lewy Body dementia.

Since May 6, his wife Jean had been caring for him at a friend's house outside Seattle, Washington. He was removed on Sunday after a judge awarded Kerri temporary custody of her father.Â

Kasem's friends and his children from his
 first marriage have been battling Jean Kasem over custody of Casey 
Kasem after she cut off access to him several months ago.

The family feud over ailing radio icon Casey Kasem just got stranger. Video has emerged of Kasem's second wife, Jean Kasem, tossing a package of raw hamburger at her daughter-in-law Kerri when she arrived to take away the 82-year-old broadcast icon.

Before chucking the meat, Jean Kasem recited a passage from the Bible.

'In the name of King David, I throw a 
piece of raw meat into the street in exchange for (giving) my husband to
 the wild rabid dogs,' the 59-year-old said, according to NBC News.

It was a dramatic scene at the Washington state home where Jean Kasem had been looking after her husband. Before it was over, paramedics, firefighters, sheriff's deputies and even members of a local motorcycle club were involved.

In NBC News video of Casey Kasem being taken to a waiting ambulance, both Kerri,41, and Jean can be seen video recording each other on their cellphones.

'You twisted pyscho! All the doctor bills that we paid for you never helped, did they?' Jean screams at Kerri.

Kerri Kasem accompanied her father 
when an ambulance took him Sunday afternoon to receive care. It is not known where the 82-year-old entertainer went.

Casey Kasem's condition is not known, but Kerri Kasem said in court Friday that her 
father is suffering from bedsores and lung and bladder infections. She 
also has said her father has a form of dementia.

Amid
 an ongoing dispute between Kerri Kasem and her stepmother, Jean Kasem, a
 Kitsap County judge ruled Friday that Kerri Kasem could have a doctor 
of her choosing examine her father.

A spokesman for Casey Kasem's daughter says the ailing radio personality has been taken by ambulance to a hospital or medical facility in Washington state.

The Kitsap County Sheriff's Office has said appropriate medical care has been provided.

A message left for Jean Kasem's representative wasn't immediately returned.

Casey Kasem and his wife have been staying with friends west of Seattle.
