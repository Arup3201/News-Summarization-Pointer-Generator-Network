Stuart Pearce has claimed that Manchester City were close to going bankrupt during his managerial spell at the Etihad Stadium.

The current Nottingham Forest manager was in charge at City between March 2005 and May 2007 and states that the sale of Shaun Wright Phillips for £21million to Chelsea shortly after his arrival proved crucial in keeping the club afloat.

'The club had sold the club shop, sold the ground to council, we were paying on the never-never for the Anelkas of this world,' Pearce told the The Mirror.

Reflect: Current Nottingham Forest boss Stuart Pearce has claimed Manchester City were close to going bust under his management between 2005 and 2007 - forcing him to sell Shaun Wright Phillips

'It really was a case that the owners said, 'Unless Wright-Phillips goes, we go.' On the Monday morning they pressed the button and Chelsea put £21million in the bank which bails the club out, which puts pressure on me because you are selling your goal-scorer. 

'The club has gone from strength to strength and now they are a world power and spending £150m on a training complex. Times change.'

City would struggle against relegation during Pearce's two full seasons at the Etihad Stadium.

It was a period in which City were struggling financially before Sheikh Mansour's billions dramatically altered the club's fortunes for the better in 2008 when he took control of the club.

By then, Pearce was long gone after he was dismissed to make way for Sven Goran Eriksson under previous owner Thaksin Shinawatra a year earlier.

Pearce looks back at his Manchester City experience with fondness though and admits as a manger it made him appreciate the youth academy.

'We had the likes of Micah Richards, Stephen Ireland, Nedum Onuoha and Kasper Schmeichel all coming through the academy system.' Pearce added.

'Ideally you don’t want to go and buy a footballer, you want to pluck him from the academy and move him from one pitch to the next.

'To do that, you have to pre-plan - and that takes sometimes years to put in place.'

Manchester City have since gone on to win two league titles in the last three years and face Arsenal in the Community Shield at Wembley this Sunday.
