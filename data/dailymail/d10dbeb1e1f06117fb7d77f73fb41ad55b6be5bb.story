A dog survived after being struck by a car then travelling 55 miles dangling from its bumper, it was reported today.

Driver Julia Cesar Siqueira said he heard a thud after turning onto a road near his home in Itapetinga, northeastern Brazil.

But the student, 35, carried on his hour-long trip towards the next town - unaware that the young mogrel was trapped inside the vehicle's front bumper grille.

It was only after arriving at his university campus in Vitoria de Conquista, Bahia state, that passers-by noticed the terrified animal and alerted him.

Mr Siqueira, who was traveling with his mother and two fellow students, told Brazil's Globo G1 website: 'I saw the dog in the middle of the road and swerved to avoid it.

'But then I heard a thud, and realised I'd hit it.

'I was traveling at speed and knew it could have survived the collision, so I kept driving. It's quite a dangerous spot.'

Arriving at his destination at around 8.30pm on Tuesday, Mr Siqueira noticed several people signalling for him to stop.

He said: 'There weren't any places to stop safely so I carried on and parked in front of the university.

'Someone told me there was a dog on the front of my car, so we went to look, imagining it was dead.

'We couldn't believe it when she appeared to still be alive and conscious.

'The force of the collision had smashed the front panel and she was trapped in the body of the car.'

Firefighters and a local vet were called who rescued the animal, which was found to have a broken front leg but was otherwise unharmed.

The bitch has now been christened Vitoria, which as well as being the name of the town, means 'Victory' in English.

A spokesman for Vitoria da Conquista's 7th Fire Brigade confirmed they had freed the dog and that it was being cared for at a private veterinary clinic in the town.

Mr Siqueira had agreed to pay all of the dog's treatment, the spokesman added.
